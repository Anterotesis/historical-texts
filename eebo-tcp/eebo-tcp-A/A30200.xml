            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Courteous Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THough this be a small Treatise, yet it doth
present thee with things of the greatest, and
most weighty concernment, even with a Discourse of
Life and Death to Eternity: opening, and clearing,
by the Scriptures of God, that the time is at hand,
when, <hi>there shall be a Resurrection of the Dead,
both of the just and unjust; even of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of both, from the Graves where they are,
or shall be, at the approach of that day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thou hast also in these few lines, the order and
manner of the rising of these two sorts of People,
wherein is shewed thee with what <hi>Body</hi> they shall
then rise; as also their states and condition at this
day, with great clearness.</p>
            <p>For here thou shalt see the truth, and manner of
the terrible Judgement, the opening of the Books,
the examining of Witnesses, with a finall conclusion
upon good and bad. Which, I hope will be profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to thy Soul that shall read it. For if thou
art godly, then here is that which will through Gods
blessing, incourage thee to go on in the faith of the
truth of the Gospel; but if thou art ungodly, then
here thou mayst meet with conviction: yea, and that
of what will be without fail, thy end, at the end of
the World: whether thou continue in thy sins, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.
<pb facs="tcp:102285:3"/>
If thou continue in them, blackness, and
darkness, and everlasting destruction; but if thou
repent and believe the Gospel, then light and life,
and joy, and comfort, and glory, and happiness, and
that to Eternity.</p>
            <p>Wherefore let me here beg these things at thy
hand.</p>
            <p>First, That thou take heed of that spirit of
mockery, that saith, 2 <hi>Pet. 3. 4, 5. Where is the
promise of his coming?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Take heed that thy heart be not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
with surfeiting and drunkenness, and the
cares of this life, and so that day come upon thee
unawares. <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 34, 35.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, But be diligent in making thy Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Election sure; that thou in the day, of
which thou shalt read more in this Book, be not
found without that glorious Righteousness that will
then stand thee instead, and present thee before his
glorious presence, with exceeding joy; to him be
glory in the Church by Christ Jesus, World with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
end, Amen.</p>

            <head>OF THE
Resurrection of the
Dead, and Eternal
Judgement</head>
            <head type="sub">But this I confess unto thee, that after the
way which they call Heresie, so worship
I the God of my Father, believing all
things that are written in the Law and
the Prophets, and have hope towards
God, which they themselves also allow,
that there shall be a Resurrection of the
Dead, both of the just, and unjust, <bibl>Acts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
24. 14, 15.</bibl>
            </head>
            <p>MY Discourse upon this Text, will
chiefly concern the Resurrection of the
Dead: wherefore to that I shall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
apply my self not medling with
what else is couched in the words.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:102285:4"/>
You see here, that <hi>Paul,</hi> being upon his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignment,
accused of many things, by some
that were violent for his blood; and being li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenced
to speak for himself by the then <hi>Heathen</hi>
Magistrate; he doth in few words tell them,
that as touching the Crimes wherewith they
charged him, he was utterly faultless, onely
this he confessed, that after that way which
they call Heresie, so he worshipped the God
of his Fathers; believing all things that are
written in the Law and the Prophets, and that
he had the same hope towards God, which they
themselves did allow, that there should be a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
of the dead, both of the just<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
unjust.</p>
            <p>Whence note by the way, <hi>That an hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
people, will persecute the power of those truths
in others, which themselves in words profess.</hi> I have
hopes towards God, and that such a hope which
themselves do allow, and yet I am this day,
and that for this very thing persecuted by
them.</p>
            <p>But to come to my purpose, there shall be a
<hi>Resurrection of the dead &amp;c.</hi> By these words,
the Apostle sheweth us what was the substance
of his Doctrine, to wit, that there should be a
<hi>Resurrection of the dead;</hi> and by these words
also, what was the great argument with his
Soul, to carry him through these temptations,
afflictions, reproaches, and necessities he met
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102285:4"/>
with in this World, even the Doctrine of a
<hi>Resurrection.</hi> I have hope towards God, saith
he, and there is my mind fixed, for there shall
be a <hi>Resurrection of the dead, both of the just, and
unjust.</hi> The reason why I cannot do what these
Jews would have me; also why I cannot live
as do the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> it is, because I have in my
Soul, the faith of the <hi>Resurrection.</hi> This is
the Doctrine I say, which maketh me fear to
offend, and that is, as an undergirder to my
Soul, whereby I am kept from destruction and
confusion, under all the storms and tempests
I here go through. In a word, this is it that
hath more awe upon my Conscience, then all
the Laws of men, with all the penalties they
inflict. Vers. 17. <hi>And herein do I exercise my
self to have alwayes a Conscience void of offence,
both towards God and towards men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now here, seeing this Doctrine of the <hi>Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of the dead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> hath that power, both to bear
up and to awe; both to incourage and to keep
within compass, the Spirit and Body of the
People of God: It will be requisite, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
for us, to inquire into the true me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ning
and nature of this word, <hi>the Resurrection of
the dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for the better compassing of this matter,
I shall briefly inquire.</p>
            <p>First, what this place is meant by the
dead.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:102285:5"/>
Secondly, What is meant by the <hi>Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, Why the Apostle doth here speak
of</hi> the Resurrection of the dead, <hi>as of a thing yet
to come, there</hi> shall be a Resurrection of the
dead, both of the just, and unjust.</p>
            <p>For the first, The dead in Scripture, go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a five-fold Consideration, as,</p>
            <p>1. Such as die a natural death, or as when
a man ceaseth to be any more in this World, as
<hi>David,</hi> whom <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, <hi>is both dead and
buried, and his Sepulchre remaineth with us to this
day.</hi> Acts 2. 29.</p>
            <p>2. There is a People that are reckoned dead
in trespasses and sins, as those are, who never
yet were translated from darkness to light, and
from the power of Satan to God. Such I say,
who yet never felt the power of the Word and
Spirit of God, to raise them from that state, to
walk with him in the Regeneration: making
a life out of Christ, and his present benefits.
<hi>Ephes. 2. 1, 2. John</hi> 5. 25.</p>
            <p>3. There is a death seizeth men often after
some measure of light received from God, and
some profession of the Gospel of Christ. These,
for the certainty of their damnation, are said
to be dead, dead; twise dead, and plucked
up by the roots. <hi>Jude</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>4. There is in Scripture mention made of a
death <hi>to sin,</hi> and the lusts of the flesh; this
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102285:5"/>
death is the beginning of true life and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and is a certain fore-runner of a share in
Christ, and with him in another World, <hi>Rom.
6. 6, 7, 8. 2 Tim.</hi> 2. 11.</p>
            <p>5. Lastly, there is also in the Word, a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of eternal death. This is the death that
those are in, and swallowed up of, that go out
of this World Godless, Christless, and Grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less;
dying in sin, and so under the curse of
the dreadful God, who I say, because they have
missed of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Saviour in
this day of Grace: are fallen into the gulf and
jaws of eternal death and misery, in the fire
that never shall be quenched. <hi>Mark 9. 43, 44.
Luk</hi> 16. 23, 24, 25, 26.</p>
            <p>Now then, seeing there is death, or to be
dead, taken under so many Considerations in
the Scripture; it is evident, that to be dead in
Christ, the Text is not meant of them all: I
then must distinguish, and inquire which of
these deaths it is, that here the Apostle did
look for a Resurrection from.</p>
            <p>First then, it cannot be meant a Resurrection
from eternal death, for from that there is <hi>no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</hi>
Psal. 49. 38.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Neither is it a Resurrection from
that double death; for they that are in that, are
past recovery also.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, And so for those that are dead to
sin, it is non-sence, to say there shall, or can be
<pb facs="tcp:102285:6"/>
a Resurrection from that: for that it self is a
Resurrection. <hi>Colos.</hi> 2. 12, 13. 20. which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
also, the Apostle had then passed
through. And also all the Brethren, as he saith,
<hi>You hath he quickned, who were dead in trespasses
and sins;</hi> and again, <hi>if ye then be risen with
Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and again, wherein also ye are risen with
him through the faith of the operation of God, who
raised him from the dead.</hi> Col. 3. 1.</p>
            <p>Lastly, The dead therefore in this Scripture,
must be understood of those that have departed
this life, that have Body and Soul seperated
each from the other; and so the Resurrection,
a Resurrection of the Body out of the Grave; as
<hi>Daniel</hi> saith, <hi>many that sleep in the dust of the
Earth shall arise;</hi> and again, <hi>the hour is coming,
when all that are in their Graves shall hear his
voice, and shall come forth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Dan. 12. 2. John</hi>
5. 28.</p>
            <p>The Resurrection of the Just then, is the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of the Bodies of the Just, and the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of the unjust, the rising of their Bodies
at the last Judgement. This also is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of that saying of <hi>Paul,</hi> to <hi>Agrippa, I stand,</hi>
saith he, <hi>and am Judged, for the hope of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
made unto our Fathers,</hi> which promise at
first began to be fulfilled in the Resurrection of
the Body of Christ, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 32, 33. and hat
its accomplishment, when the dead, small and
great, are raised out of their Graves: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102285:6"/>
though <hi>Paul</hi> saith in the 13th of the <hi>Acts,</hi>
it is already fulfilled: yet here he saith, he
hopes it shall come. <hi>Which promise,</hi> saith he,
<hi>our twelve Tribes instantly serving God day and
might, hope to come,</hi> as God told <hi>Daniel,</hi> saying,
<hi>go thy Way, for thou shalt stand in thy lot at the end
of the dayes.</hi> Dan. 12, 13.</p>
            <p>Christ is already risen, and therefore so far
the promise is fulfilled, but his Saints are yet
in their Graves, and therefore that part of the
fulfilling of it, is yet to come, as he saith, <hi>Why
should it be an incredible thing with you, that God
should raise the dead.</hi> Acts 26. 6, 7, 8.</p>
            <p>Again, That it is the Resurrection of the
dead Bodies of both Saints and sinners that is
here inserted, it is further evident, because the
Apostle saith, it is the Resurrection, that the
<hi>very Pharises themselves allowed.</hi> I have hope
towards God, saith he, which themselves also
allow, then what that hope is, he in the next
words sheweth, namely, <hi>That there shall be a
Resurrection of the Dead, &amp;c.</hi> Now we know,
that the Pharises did not allow of a Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
from a state of Nature, to a state of
Grace, which is the same with the new birth;
but did confidently allow and teach, that they
were the Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> according to
the flesh. Yea, when any of them began to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here,
or incline to Christ's Doctrine in some
things, yet the Doctrine of the new Birth, or of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102285:7"/>
being raised from a state of Nature, to a state
of Grace, they would very much stick at;
though in the mean time, they utterly were
against the Doctrine of the Sadduces, <hi>which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
the Resurrection of the Body,</hi> John 31. 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>John 8. 31, 32, 33, 34, 35. Acts</hi>
23. 6, 7, 8.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Further, the Resurrection here spoken of,
must needs be the Resurrection of the Body,
because it is called,</hi> a Resurrection of the Dead,
both of the just, and unjust, <hi>that is, of both Saints
and sinners, according to the saying of Christ,</hi>
The hour is coming, when all that are in their
Graves shall hear his Voyce, and shall come forth,
they that have done good, to the Resurrection of
life; and they that have done evill, to the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of damnation. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 28, 29.</p>
            <p>Again, the Resurrection here mentioned, is
a Resurrection <hi>to come,</hi> not already injoyed,
either by Saints or sinners, <hi>there shall be a Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of the Dead, both of the just, and unjust.</hi>
Now I say, the Resurrection here being yet
deferred by the just, and counted also the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
of the dead, both of the just and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just:
It must needs be the same Resurrection
that is spoken of by <hi>Jobe,</hi> who saith, <hi>So man ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
down, and riseth not again, till the Heavens be
no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of
their sleep,</hi> Job. 14. 12.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:102285:7"/>
Having thus in few words opened this Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
unto you, I shall in the next place, for
the further satisfaction of those that are yet
wavering, and for the refreshment of those
that are strong and stedfast: lay down before
you, several undeniable Scripture demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<hi>of the Resurrection of the Dead, both of the
just, and unjust.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall first begin with the Resurrection of
the Just.</p>
            <p>The Just must arise, because Christ is risen
from the dead. Christ is the head of the Just,
and they are the members of his Body; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of this union, therefore the Just must a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise.
This is the Apostles own Argument, <hi>If
Christ,</hi> saith he, <hi>be preached, that he rose from the
dead, how say some among you, that there is no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
of the dead; but if there be no Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of the dead, then is not Christ risen.</hi> 1 Cor.
15. 12, 13. Now I say, the Reason why the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
thus argueth the Resurrection from the
dead, by the Resurrection of Christ. It is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Saints (of whose Resurrection he
here chiefly discourseth, are in their Bodies, as
well as in their Soul, the members of Christ;
<hi>know you not,</hi> saith he, <hi>that your Bodies are the
members of Christ,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 15. A very weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Argument; for if a good man be a member
of Christ, then he must either be raised out of
his Grave, or else sin and death must have
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102285:8"/>
power over a member of Christ. I say again, if
if this Body be not raised, then also Christ is
not a compleat Conquerour over his enemies;
for as much as death and the Grave, hath still
power over his members. <hi>The last Enemy that
shall be destroyed, is Death.</hi> Now though Christ
in his own person, hath a compleat Conquest
over Death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet Death hath still power
over the Bodies of all that are in their Graves:
now I say, Christ being considered with rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to his members, then he hath not yet a
compleat Conquest over death, neither will he,
until they every one be brought forth of their
Graves; for then, and not till then, shall that
saying be every way fulfilled: <hi>Death is swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
up of Victory,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 26. and 53,
54.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As there must be a Resurrection
of the Just, because Christ is their Head, and
they his members: so also, because the Body
of the Saints, as well as their Soul, is the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
of Christs blood. <hi>Ye are bought with a price,</hi>
saith Paul: <hi>wherefore glorifie God in your Body,
and in your Spirit, which are Gods.</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 20.
Christ will not lose the purchase of his blood,
<hi>O Death,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>I will have them; O
Grave, I will make thee let them go, I will ransom
them from the power of the Grave, I will redeem
them from death.</hi> (I have bought them, and they
shall be mine) <hi>O Death, I will be thy plague, O
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:102285:8"/>
Grave, I will be thy destruction,</hi> Hos. 13, 14.
Job 18. 13, 14. Revel. 1. 18. I say, though the
power of the Grave be <hi>invincible,</hi> and death be
the <hi>King of terrours,</hi> yet he who hath <hi>the Keys of
Hell and of Death,</hi> at his Girdle, to him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
the <hi>issues from death. He that is our
God, is the God of Salvation, and to God the
Lord, belongeth the issues from death.</hi> Psal. 68.
20. and we the price of his blood, shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, As the Body is the member of
Christ, and the price of his blood: so it is the
Temple of the Holy Ghost, which is in us.
<hi>What, know you not that your Body is the Temple
of the Holy Ghost which is in you? and you are not
your own.</hi> The Body is no such rediculous thing
in the account of Christ, as it was in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the Saduces. <hi>The Body is not for forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
but for the Lord, and the Lord for the
Body,</hi> and that no onely in this World, but that
which is to come: wherefore he saith, <hi>God
hath both raised up the Lord Jesus, and will raise
us up also by his power.</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 13, 14. 19. that
is, as he hath raised up the Body of Christ: so
will he raise up ours also by Christ.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Bodies of the Just must arise
again, because of that Similitude, that must be
betwixt the Body of the Lord Jesus Christ, and
the Bodies of the Saints. <hi>When he shall appear,
we shall be like him.</hi> 1 John 3. 2. Now we have
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:102285:9"/>
it abundantly manifest in Scripture, that the
Body of the Lord Jesus, was raised out of the
Grave, caught up into Heaven, and that it
ever remaineth in the holiest of all, a glorified
Body, <hi>Luk 24. 3, 4, 5 6, 7, 8. 35. 36, 37, 38, 39,
40, 41, 42. John 20. 24, 25, 26, 27. Acts 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Acts 2. 31. Acts 17.
30, 31, 32. Mar. 16. 6, 7, 19. Heb. 7. 24, 25,
26. eb. 8. 2, 3. Heb.</hi> 10. 12.</p>
            <p>Now I say, it would be very strange to me,
if Christ should be raised, ascended, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
in that Body; and yet that his People
should be with him, no otherwise then in their
Spirits; especially, seeing that he in his Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
is said to be but <hi>the first begotten from
the dead, and the first fruits of them that sleep,</hi>
Col. 1. 18. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 23. for we know, that a
first begotten, doth imply more Sons, and that
first-fruits do foreshew an after Crop: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we conclude, <hi>that as in</hi> Adam <hi>all die, so
in Christ shall all be made alive, but every man
in his own order: Christ the first fruits, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
them that are his at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>is coming.</hi> 1 Cor.
15. 22, 23.</p>
            <p>And hence it is, that the Scripture saith, <hi>He
shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned
like to his glorious Body.</hi> And hence it is again,
that the day of Christ is said to be <hi>the day of
the manifestation of the Sons of God, and of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
of our body;</hi> for then shall the Saints
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:102285:9"/>
of God not onely be, but appear as their Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
being delivered from their Graves, as he
is from his, and glorified in their Bodies, as he
is in his. <hi>Phil. 3. 20, 21. Rom.</hi> 8. 21, 22, 23.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, There must be a Resurrection of
the Body of the Saints, because the Body, as
well as the mind, hath been a deep sharer in
the afflictions that we meet with for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
sake. Yea, the body is oft-times the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
sufferer, in all the Calamities, that for
Christs sake we here undergo; it is the body
that feels the stocks, the whip, hunger and cold,
the fire and rack, and a thousand calamities: it
is the body in which we have the dying marks
of the Lord Jesus: <hi>that the life of Jesus, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
might be made manifest in our mortall slesh.
Gal. 6. 17. 2 Cor.</hi> 4. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. God is
so just a God, and so merciful to his People,
that though the bodies of his Saints should,
through the malice of the enemy, be never so
dishonourably tortured, killed and sown in the
Grave: yet he will (as further will be shewed
anon) raise it again in incorruption, glory and
honour: as he saith also in another place, <hi>that
we who have continued with Christ in his tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
that have for his sake underwent the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
and malice of the World; to you,</hi> saith
Christ, <hi>I appoint a Kingdom as my Father hath
appointed unto me.</hi> Luk. 22. 28, 29. <hi>If we suffer
with him, we shall reign with him, &amp; he that hateth
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:102285:10"/>
his life in this World, shall keep it to life eternall,</hi>
2 <hi>Tim. 2. 12. John</hi> 12. 29. all this is to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed,
especially at the Resurrection of the
Just.</p>
            <p>But sixthly, There must be a Resurrection
of the Just, otherwise, there will be the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
disappointment on all sides that ever was,
since man had a being on the Earth.</p>
            <p>A disappointment I say,</p>
            <p>First, Of the <hi>Will</hi> of God; <hi>for this is the
will of the Father that sent me,</hi>saith Christ, <hi>that 
of all that he hath given me, I should lose nothing,</hi>
(not a dust) <hi>but should raise it up again at the
last day.</hi> John 6. 39.</p>
            <p>Secondly, A disappointment of the <hi>Power</hi>
of God; <hi>for he that hath raised up the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
doth also intend to raise us up by his Power,</hi>
even our Bodies, as <hi>Paul</hi> saith, the body is not
for fornication, but for the Lord, and the Lord
for the body, and God hath both raised up the
Lord, and will also raise us up by his Power.
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 13, 14.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If there should be no Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Just, Christ also would be wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
disappointed of the fruits of all his suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.
As I told you before, his People are
the price of his Blood, and the members of his
Body, and he is now at the right hand of God
(far above all Principalities and Powers, and
every name that is named) <hi>expecting till his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:102285:10"/>
be made his Footstool, and brought under</hi>
Heb. 1. 13. the foot of the weakest Saint, which
will not be, untill the last enemy Death is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed.
We know that he said, when he went
away, that he would come again, and fetch all
his People to himself, even up into Heaven,
that where he is, there we may be also. <hi>Joh. 12.
26. Joh. 14. 1, 2, 3. Joh.</hi> 17. 24. But I say, how
will he be disappointed, if when he comes, the
Grave and Death should prevent and hinder
him, and with its bars, keep down those, whom
he hath ransomed with his blood, from the
power thereof.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, If the Bodies of the Just arise
from the dead, then <hi>they</hi> also will be disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.
'Tis true, the Saints departed, have
far more fellowship, and Communion with
God and the Lord Jesus, then we have, or are
not yet capable of having, <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 43. They
being in Paradise, and we in this World; but
yet, I say for all that, they are, though there,
very much longing for the day of the Lords
vengeance, <hi>which will be the day in which they
will, and must arise from the dead.</hi> This I say, is
the time that they long for, when they cry un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Altar, <hi>How long O Lord, holy and
true, dost thou not judge and avenge our
blood, on them that dwell on the Earth?</hi>
When they died, they <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 35. died, <hi>in
hope to obtain a better Resurrection,</hi> and now they
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:102285:11"/>
are gone, they long till that day be come, <hi>Rev.</hi>
6. 10, 11. Till the day come, I say, when the
dead, even all the enemies of Christ, shall be
judged; <hi>for then will he give reward to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
the Prophets, and to his Saints, and to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
that fear his name, small and great.</hi> Revel. 11.
1. 8.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, If the Just arise not, great disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
also will be to the Saints yet alive in
this World: for, notwithstanding they have
already received the first-fruits of the Spirit,
yet the wait, not onely for more of that, but
also for the Resurrection, Redemption, and
changing of this vile body, <hi>Rom. 8. 20, 21, 22,
23. Phil. 3. 20, 21. For our Conversation is in
Heaven,</hi> saith Paul, <hi>from whence we look for the
Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall change
our vile body, that it may be fashioned like to his
glorious body.</hi> But now I say, if the body riseth
not, then how can it be made like to the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Body of Christ Jesus: yea, what a sad dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment,
infatuation, and delusion, are
those poor Creatures under, that look, and that
by Scripture warrant, for such a thing? They
look for good, but behold evill; they expect
to be delivered in their whole man from every
enemy; but lo, both death and the Grave, their
great enemies, do swallow them up for ever;
But Beloved, be not deceived, <hi>Psal. 9. 10. T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e

                  </gap>tion
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:102285:11"/>
of the poor shall not perish for ever,</hi> saith Christ,
<hi>he that seeth the Son, and believeth on him that
sent him, hath everlasting life, and I will raise
him up at the last day,</hi> John 6. 40.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, If the Just arise not out of their
Graves, then also is every Grace of God in
our Souls defeated; for though the spirit of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
can put forth a feigned shew of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
with the denyal of the Resurrection, yet
every Grace of God in the Elect, doth prompt
them forward to live as becomes the Gospel, by
pointing at this day, as</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First, 'Tis this that faith looks at, according
as it is written,</hi> I believed, and therefore have I
spoken; we believed, and therefore speak, knowing
that he that hath raised up the Lord Jesus, shall
raise us up also by Jesus, and shall present us with
you. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4 13, 14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, Hope looks at this,</hi> We <hi>saith
P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ul,</hi> which have the first fruits of the Spirit, even
we our selves groan within our selves, waiting for
the ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ption, to wit, the redemption of our Body,
<hi>that is, we expect this by hope:</hi> but hope which
is seen, is not hope, for what a man seeth, or hath
in present possession, why doth he yet hope for it.
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 23, 24, 25.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Grace of self-denyal also
wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>keth by this Doctrine, <hi>If after the manner
of men, I have fought with Beasts at</hi> Ephesus;
<hi>what advantageth it me, if the Dead rise not? As
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:102285:12"/>
who should say;</hi> wherefore do I deny my self of
those mercies and priviledges, that the men of
this World injoy? why do not I also, as well as
they, shun persecution for the Cross of Christ?
If the dead rise not, what shall I be the better
for all my trouble that here I met with for the
Gospel of Christ? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 32.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly, Both Zeal and patience, with all
other the Graces of the Spirit of God in our
hearts, are much, yea chiefly, incouraged, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated,
and supported by this Doctrine, as</hi>
James <hi>saith,</hi> Be patient therefore my Brethren, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the coming of the Lord, <hi>(for then shall the
dead be raised.</hi> 1 Thes. 4. 16, 17.) Behold, the
Husbandman waiteth for the precious fruits of the
Earth, and hath long patience, till he receive both
the early and latter Rayn; be ye also patient, stablish
your hearts, for the coming of the Lord draws nigh.
<hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 7, 8.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, The Doctrine of the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Just, must needs be a certain truth of
God, if we consider the devilish, and satanical
errours and absurdities that must unavoidably
follow the denyal thereof, as</p>
            <p>First, He that holdeth no Resurrection of
our Body, he denyeth the Resurrection of
the Body of Christ: this is the Spirits own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;
<hi>For if the Dead rise not, then is not Christ
risen,</hi> 1 Cor. 15, 16. He that denyeth the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
of the members, denyeth the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:102285:12"/>
of the Head; for seeing the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Saints is proved by the Resurrection
of Christ, he that doth deny the Resurrection
of the Saints, must needs deny the Resurrection
of Christ, that proves it.</p>
            <p>Now this errour, as it is in it self destructive
to all Christian Religion: so it, like an Adder,
carrieth within its bowels, many other alike
devilish and filthy, as</p>
            <p>1. He that denyeth the Resurrection of the
Saints, he concludeth, that to preach delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
from sin and death, it is vain preaching;
for how can he be freed of sin, that is swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
up for ever of Death, &amp; the Grave? as he
most certainly is, that is always contained ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
as <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>if Christ be not risen,</hi> (whose
Resurrection is the ground of ours) <hi>then our
preaching</hi> is vain, <hi>and your faith is also vain; then
we preach fables, and you receive them for truth.</hi>
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 14.</p>
            <p>2. This errour, casteth the Lie in the face
of God, of Christ, and the Scriptures, <hi>ye, and
we also,</hi> saith Paul, <hi>are found false Witnesses of
God, because we have testified of God, that he rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Christ up, if so be that the dead rise not.</hi> 1 Cor.
15. 15. Mark, before he said, Christ in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,
doth prove our Resurrection; but
now he saith, that our Resurrection will prove
the truth of his, and indeed, both are true; for
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:102285:13"/>

But you will say, he that giveth up himself to
God shall have comfort in this life. Ah, but <hi>if
the dead rise not,</hi> all our comfort that now we
think we have from God, will then be found
presumption and madness, because we believe,
that God hath so loved us, as to have us in his
day, in Body and Soul to Heaven: which will
be nothing so, if the dead rise not. If in this

            <p>6. To deny this Resurrection, nay if a man
do but say, it is past either with him or any
Christian: his so saying tendeth directly to
the dest<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uction and overthrow of the faith of
them that hear him; and is so far from being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Doctrine of God, that it eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
out good and wholsome Doctrine, even as
Cankers eat the face and flesh of a man: how
ill favouredly do they look, that have their nose
and lips eat off with the Canker? even so
badly doth the Doctrine of no Resurrection of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:102285:14"/>
the dead, look in the eyes of God, Christ,
Saints and Scripture. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 18.</p>
            <p>Lastly, I conclude then, that to deny the
<hi>Resurrection</hi> of the Bodies of the Just, it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth,</p>
            <p>First, Great ignorance of God, ignorant
of his power to raise, ignorant of his promise
to raise, ignorant of his faithfulness to raise; and
that both to himself, Son, and Saints, as I
shewed before: therefore saith <hi>Paul</hi> to those
that were thus deluded, <hi>Awake to Righteousness,
and sin not, for some have not the knowledge of
God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I speak this to your shame,</hi> 1 Cor. 18. 32,
33, 34. as if he had said, Do you profess Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity?
and do you question the <hi>Resurrection</hi>
of the Body? Do you not know, that the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection</hi>
of the Body, and glory to follow, is
the very quintessence of the Gospel of Jesus
Christ? Are you ignorant of the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of
the Lord Jesus, and do you question the power
and faithfulness of God, both to his Son and
his Saints, because you say, there shall be no
<hi>Resurrection</hi> of the Dead? you are ignorant of
God; of what he can do, of what he will do,
and of what he will by doing, glorifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As it argueth very great igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of Gods power, faithfulness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so it
argueth gross ignorance of the Tenor and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ant
of the Scriptures; for as touching the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:102285:14"/>
Dead, that they are raised, have ye not read in
the Book of <hi>Moses</hi> (saith Christ) how that <hi>God</hi>
said unto him in the Bush, <hi>I am the God of</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,
<hi>the God of</hi> Isaac, <hi>and the God of</hi> Jacob?
God is not the God of the Dead, but of the
Living: ye do therefore greatly erre, <hi>Mark</hi>
12. 26, 27.</p>
            <p>To be the God of <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi>
it is to be understood of his being their
God, under a new Covenant-Consideration, as
he saith, <hi>I will be their God, and they shall be my
People. Heb. 8. 10, 11. John 8. 44. 1 John 38.
9, 10. Hos. 6. 2. Col. 3. 4. Ephes.</hi> 1. 4. Now
thus he is not the God of the Dead, that is, of
those that perish, whether they be Angels or
men.</p>
            <p>Now, I say, they that are the Children of
God, as <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> they are
counted the Living under a threefold Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>1. In their Lord and Head, and thus all the
Elect may be said to live; for they are from
Eternity chosen in him, who also is their life,
though possibly many of them yet unconverted.
I say, yet Christ is their life, by the eternal pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of God.</p>
            <p>2. The Children of the new Covenant, do
live both in their spirits in glory, by open vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and here by Faith <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. and the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:102285:15"/>
continu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l Communication of Grace from
Christ into their Souls.</p>
            <p>3. They live also with respect to their ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
again; for God calleth those things that
are not, as though they were, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 17. to be
born, dead, buried, risen and ascended, are all
present with God, he liveth not by time, as we
do, a thousand years to him, are but as the day
that is past, 2 <hi>Pet. 3. 8. Heb. 4. 13. Isa. 46. 9,
10. Rom.</hi> 8. 29, 30, 31, 32, 33. And again, one
day is as a thousand years. Eternity, which is
God himself, admitteth of no first, second, and
third, all things are naked and bare before
him, and present with him, all (his) live unto
him. <hi>There shall be a Resurrection of the Dead,
both of the Just, and unjust.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>Resurrection,</hi> of what? of that which is
sown, or of that which was never sown; if of
that which is sown, then it must be either of
that nature that was sown, or else of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
that cleaveth to it; but it is the nature,
and not the corruption that cleaveth unto it
that riseth again. And verily, the very terme
<hi>Resurrection,</hi> is a forcible Argument, to prove
the Dead shall come forth of their Graves; for
the holy Ghost hath alwayes spoke more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,
then to say, <hi>There shall be a Resurrection
of the Dead, both of the Just and unjust,</hi> when
yet neither the good, nor the bad shall come
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:102285:15"/>
forth of their Graves, but rather something
else to delude the World withall.</p>
            <p>Having thus in few words, shewed you the
truth of <hi>the Resurrection of the Dead,</hi> I now
come to the manner of their rising.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The manner of the Resurrection of the
Dead: And first of the
Just.</head>
               <p>THE Apostle, when he had in the fifteenth
of the first of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> proved the
truth and certainty of the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends
to the discovery of the manner of it;
and to the end, he might remove those foolish
scruples that attend the hearts of the ignorant,
he begins with one of their Questions; <hi>But
some will say,</hi> saith he, <hi>how are the Dead
raised? and with what</hi> Vers. 35. <hi>Body do they
come?</hi> To which he answereth: first by a Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude
of Seed, that is sown in the Earth.
In which Similitude, he inserteth three
things.</p>
               <p>First, That our reviving or rising, must be
after Death, <hi>That which thou sowest, is not quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
except it die.</hi> Vers. 36.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:102285:16"/>
Secondly, That at our rising, we shall not
onely revive and live, but be changed into a
far more glorious state, then when we were
sown. Vers. 37. <hi>That which thou sowest, thou
sowest not that Body that shall be,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But God
giveth it a Body as it pleaseth him,</hi> that is, he
giveth the Body more splendor, luster, and
beauty, at its Resurrection.</p>
               <p>But Thirdly, Neither its quickning, not
yet transcendent, splendor, shall hinder it
from being the same Body, (as to the nature
of it) that was sown in the Earth; for as God
giveth it a Body, for Honour and Splendor, as
it pleaseth him, so Vers. 38. <hi>to every Seed his
own Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And indeed, this Similitude by which he
here reasoneth the manner of the <hi>Resurrection
of the Just,</hi> is very natural, and fitly suiteth
each particular; for, as to its Burial,</p>
               <p>First, The Corn of Wheat is first dead,
and after sown and buried in the Earth, and so
is the Body of Man.</p>
               <p>Secondly, After the Corn is thus dead and
buried, then it quickneth, and reviveth to life:
so also shall it be with our Body; for after it
is laid in the Grave and buried, it shall then
quicken, rise, and revive.</p>
               <p>Again, As to the manner of its change in
its rising, this Similitude also doth fitly
suit, as</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:102285:16"/>
First, It is sown a dead Corn, it is raised a
living one.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is sown dry, and without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
it riseth green and beautiful.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is sown a single Corn, it riseth a
full Ear.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It is sown in its husk, but in its
rising it leaveth that Husk behind it.</p>
               <p>Further, Though the Curnel thus dy, be
buried, and meet with all this change and alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
in these things: yet none of them can
cause the nature of the Curnel to cease; it is
Wheat still. Wheat was sown, and Wheat
ariseth, onely it was sown dead, drie, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
Wheat; and riseth living, beautiful, and
fruitful Wheat. It hath this alteration then,
that it doth greatly change its resemblance,
though yet it hath this power, as still to retain
its own nature. God giveth it a Body, as it
pleaseth him; <hi>but to every Seed his own
Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apostle having thus presented the
manner of the <hi>Resurrection of the Saints,</hi> by the
nature of Seed sown, and rising again: he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth,
for further illustration, to three more
Similitudes.</p>
               <p>The first is, to shew us the variety and glory
of flesh.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:102285:17"/>
The second is, to shew us the difference of
Glory that if between Heavenly Bodies, and
those that are Earthy.</p>
               <p>The third is to shew us the difference that
is between the Glory of the light of the Sun,
from that of the Moon; and also how one Star
differeth from another in Glory. And then
concludeth, <hi>so is the Resurrection of the
Dead.</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 39 40 41, 42. As who should
say, at the Resurrection of the Bodies, they
will be ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap>lantly more al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed and changed,
then if the flesh of Beasts and Fouls were made
as noble as the flesh of men; or the Bodies of
Earth, were made as excellent as the Heavenly
Bodies; or as if the glory of the Moon should
be made as bright, and as clear as the glory of
the Sun; or as if the glory of the least Star was
as glorious, and as shining, as the biggest in
the Firmament of Heaven.</p>
               <p>It is a <hi>Resurrection</hi> indeed, a <hi>Resurrection</hi>
every way. The Body ariseth as to the nature
of it; the self-same nature; but as to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of it: how far transcendant is it! there is
a poor, dry, wrinkled Curnel cast into the
ground, and there it lyeth, and swelleth,
breatheth, and one would think, perisheth; but
behold, it receiveth life, it chitteth, it putteth
forth a blade, and groweth into a stalk; there
also appeareth an Ear; it also sweetly Blos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soms,
with a full Curnel in the Ear, it is the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:102285:17"/>
same Wheat, yet behold how the form and
fashion of that which now ariseth, doth differ
from that which then was sown, its glory also
when 'twas sown, is no glory: when compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with that in which it riseth. And yet it is
the same that riseth that was sown, and no
other: though the same after a far more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
manner, not the same with its <hi>husk,</hi> but
without it. Our <hi>brun</hi> shall be left behind us
when we rise again. The Comparison also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Bodies Heavenly, and Bodies
Earthly, hold forth the same. The glory of the
Celestial is one, and the glory of the Terrestial
is another. Now mark it, he doth not speak
here of the natures of each of these Bodies: but
of the transcendant glory of one above ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<hi>The glory of the Heavenly is one, and the
glory of the Earthly is another.</hi> Wherefore I say,
at our rising, we shall not change our <hi>nature,</hi>
but our <hi>glory, We shall be equal to the Angels,
Luke</hi> 20. 36. Not with respect to their <hi>nature,</hi>
but glory. The nature also of the Moon is one
thing, and the glory of the Moon is another:
and so, one Star also differeth from another in
glory.</p>
               <p>A Beggar hath the same nature as a King, and
Gold in the Ore, the same nature with that
which is best refined; but the Beggar hath not
the same glory with the King, nor yet the Gold
in Ore, the same glory with that which is refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:102285:18"/>
But our state will be far more altered,
than any of these in the dayes when we like so
many Suns in the Firmament of Heaven, arise
out of the heart and bowels of the Earth.</p>
               <p>These things thus considered, do shew you
how vainly they argue, that say, our humane
nature consisting of Body and Soul, shall not
inherit the Kingdom of God, and also how far
from their purpose, that saying of the Apostle
is, which saith, [<hi>That flesh and blood shall not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit
the Kingdom of God.</hi>] And now also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I am fallen upon the Objection it self, I
shall not passe it, but with a short dash at it.
Wherefore Reader, whoever thou art, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that frequently in Scripture, the word
<hi>flesh</hi> and <hi>blood</hi> (as also in the place alledged) is
not to be understood of that matter which <hi>God</hi>
made; which flesh cleaveth to our bones, and
blood runs in our veins: but is taken for that
corruption, weakness, mortality, and evil that
cleaveth to it. Which weakness and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
because it possesseth all men, &amp; also wholy
ruleth where the Soul is unconverted: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it beareth the name of that which is ruled,
and acted by it, to wit, our whole man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of Body and Soul; yet I say, is a thing
distinct from that flesh and blood which is es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential
to our being, and without which, we
are no men. As for instance, he that is Christs,
saith <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 5. 24. <hi>hath Crucified the flesh,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:102285:18"/>
with the affections and lusts.</hi> Who is so vain as
to think that the Apostle by these words, should
mean our material flesh that hangeth on our
bones, and that is mixed with our natural
blood, sinews, and veins. And not rather of
that inward fountain of sin, corruption and
wickedness, which in another place he calleth
<hi>the old man with his deceitful lusts,</hi> Ephes. 4. 22.
Again, <hi>The flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the
spirit against the flesh:</hi> Is it our flesh that hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
on our bones, which lusteth against the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit?
and that also against which the spirit lust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth?
Certainly, if the spirit lusteth against our
material flesh, then it is our duty not to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
it at all, because, by nourishing of it, we
nourish that against which the Spirit of God
fighteth, and warreth. Nay, if the spirit lust
against the flesh on our bones, simply consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
as flesh; and if it be our duty to follow
the spirit, as it is, then we must needs kill our
selves, or cut our flesh from our bones. For
whatever the Spirit of God lusteth against, it
must be destroyed, yea, it is our duty with all
speed to destroy it. But wilt thou know O vain
man, that by flesh here, is to be understood, not
the nature that God hath made, but the corrupt
apprehension, and wisdom, with those inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to evil, that lodg within us. Which in
another place is called, the <hi>Wisdom of the flesh.</hi>
Yea, in plain termes, <hi>flesh and blood,</hi> where
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:102285:19"/>
Christ saith, <hi>flesh and blood hath not revealed this
unto thee, but my Father which is in Heaven.
Mat.</hi> 16. 16.</p>
               <p>Nay, observe it, all these places, with many
others, do rather point at a corrupt Soul, then
a corrupt Body; for indeed, sin and all spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
wickedness, they have their seat in the
heart and soul of a man, and by their using this
or that member of the body, so defile the man;
the weaknesses of the body, or that attend our
material flesh and blood, they are weaknesses
of another kind, as sickness, aches, pains, soars,
wounds, defection of members, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
where you read of flesh and blood, as
rejected of God; especially, when it speaks of
the flesh and blood of Saints, you are not to
understand it as me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nt of the flesh, which is
their proper humane nature; but of that weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
which cleaveth to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> in another place, reckoneth up the
works of the flesh, in many things, as in Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft,
hatred, variance, strife, emulation, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,
and many others. But can any ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
that he there, should strike at that flesh
that hangeth on our bone? or rather at that
malignity and rebellion that is in the mind of
man against the Lord, <hi>Gal.</hi> 17, 18, 19, 20. by
reason of which, the members of the Body are
used this way, and also sometimes that, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:102285:19"/>
its most filthy and abusive deeds.
<hi>They are Enemies in their Minds by wicked
Works,</hi> Col. 1. 21.</p>
               <p>Thus you see that <hi>Flesh and Blood</hi> is not to be
taken always for the Flesh, that is upon our
hands and feet, and other parts of our Body;
but for that sinne, weakness, and infirmity, that
cleaveth to our whole man.</p>
               <p>Further then, touching our reall substantiall
flesh, it may be either considered as God's
Creature purely, or as corrupted with sinne and
infirmity. Now if you consider it as corrupted,
so it shall not inherit the Kingdom of God: but
yet consider it as God's Creature, and so all
that God hath converted to himself, through Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, shall, even with that Body, when
changed, inherit the Kingdom of God. The
Woman whose Cloaths are foul, can yet distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
between the Dirt and the Cloth on
which it hangeth; and so deals God with us.
'Tis true, there is not one Saint, but while he
liveth here, his Body is arrayed and infected
with many corrupt and filthy things, as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
bodily weaknesses; yea, and also with many
sinful infirmities, by reason of that body of Sin
and Death that yet remains in us: But yet God
I say, distinguisheth between our weaknesses,
and his Workmanship, and can tell how to save
the whole Man of his People, while he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:102285:20"/>
the Corruption and Weakness that
cleaveth to them.</p>
               <p>And now to return to the place objected,
<hi>Flesh and Blood shall not inherit the Kingdom of
God.</hi> It cannot be truly understood, that that
flesh which is Man's Nature, shall not enter
the Kingdom: For then, as I said before, Christ
must lose his Members, the purchase of his
Bloud, the Vessels and Temples of his Spirit;
for all this is our Body. Again, then Christ
also in that his Body, which is also our Flesh
and Blood, is not in Glory, contrary to the
whole Current of the New Testament, <hi>Heb. 2.
14, 15. Heb. 7. 24, 25. Heb. 8. 3, 4. Heb. 10.
10, 11, 12. Rev. 1. 18. Rev.</hi> 2. 8.</p>
               <p>Yea, it would be Non-sence to say, there
should be <hi>a Resurrection,</hi> and that <hi>our</hi> vile Body
shall be <hi>changed, and made like to the Glorious
Body of the Son of God;</hi> if this Body do not at all
rise again, but some other thing, which is not in
us, and our Nature. But to be short, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
here, when he saith, <hi>Flesh and Blood
shall not inherit,</hi> &amp;c. speaks properly of that
Mortality and Weakness, that now attends our
whole Man, and not of our reall substantial Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
it self. For after he had said, <hi>Flesh and
Blood shall not inherit the Kingdom of God;</hi> he
adds, <hi>Neither doth Corruption inherit in corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi>
Which two sayings, are answerable to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:102285:20"/>
what he presently adds; Saying, Behold! <hi>I
shew you a Mystery, we shall not all sleep, but we
shall all be changed in a moment, in the twinckling
of an Eye, at the last Trump, for the Trumpet
shall sound, and the Dead;</hi> mark, the <hi>Dead shall
be raised incorruptible;</hi> that is, the Dead shall
be so raised, as that in their rising, Incorruption
shall possess them, in stead of Corruption, and
Immortality, instead of that Mortality that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
to the Grave with them. For this Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible;
mark, this Corruptible, shall put on
incorruption; and this mortal shall put on Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality:
Mark, I say, it is this Corruptible, and
this Mortal, that must be raised, though not
Corruptible and Mortal, as it was buried; but
immortal and incorruptible: it shall leave its
Grave-Cloaths of Corruption and Mortality be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
it, <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 50, 51. 52, 53.</p>
               <p>The manner of which their Rising, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
doth more distinctly branch out a little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
in four particulars: Which particulars,
are these that follow,</p>
               <p>1. It is sown in Corruption; it is raised in
Incorruption.</p>
               <p>2. It is sown in Dishonour, it is raised in
Glory.</p>
               <p>3. It is sown in Weakness, it is raised in
Power.</p>
               <p>4. It is sown a Natural Body, it is raised a
Spiritual Body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:102285:21"/>
First, it is raised in Incorruption: We are
brought into this World by Sin and Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
Corruption is our Father, and in Sin did
our Mother conceive us, <hi>Job 17. 14. Psal.</hi> 51. 5.
And hence it is, that we have our Life; nnt
onely like a span, shadow, or post, for shortness,
but also, that it is attended with so much vanity
and vexation of spirit: But now being raised
from the Dead incorruptible, (which is also
called a Begetting and Birth) these Things that
now in our Life annoy us, and at last take away
our Life, are effectually destroy'd: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we live for ever, as saith the Spirit; <hi>And
there shall be no more Death, nor Sorrow, nor Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
neither shall there be any more pain, for the
former things</hi> (that is, all our Corruptibleness)
<hi>are passed away,</hi> Rev. 21. 4.</p>
               <p>There shall be in our Resurrection no Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
either of Body, of Soul; no weakness,
nor sickness, nor any thing tending that way; as
he saith, <hi>He will present us to himself a Glorious
Church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such
thing,</hi> Ephes. 5. 25, 26, 27. Therefore when he
saith, it is raised in Incorruption, it is, as if he
had said, It is impossible that they should ever
sin more, be sick more, sorrow more, or die
more. <hi>They that shall be counted worthy of that
World, and the Resurrection from the Dead, neither
marry, nor are given in Marriage,</hi> (though 'twas
thus with them in this World) <hi>neither can they
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:102285:21"/>
die any more, for they are equal unto the Angels,
and are the Children of God, being the Children of
the Resurrection,</hi> Luk. 20. 27, 28, 29, 30, 31,
32, 33, 34, 35, 36.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is raised in Glory; the Disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
that doth attend the Saint at his depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this World, it is very great, <hi>he is sown in
dishonour;</hi> he is so loathsom at his death, that
his dearest friends are weary of him, stop their
noses at him, see no beauty in him, nor set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
price upon him. (I speak nothing here, how
some of them are banged, starved, banished, and
so die, torn to pieces, and not suffered to be
put into Graves;) but it is raised in glory.
Glory is the sweetness, comliness, purity, and
perfection of a thing. The light is the glory
of the Sun, strength is the glory of youth, and
gray hairs is the glory of old Age. That is, it
is the excellency of these things, and that
which makes them shine. 1 <hi>Cor. 15, 40, 41.
Prov.</hi> 20. 29.</p>
               <p>Therefore to arise in glory, it is first to arise
in all the beauty, and utmost compleatness that
is possible to possess a humane Creature, I say, in
all its features &amp; members, inconceivably beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull:
sin and corruption hath made mad work
in our bodies, as well as in our Souls; 'Tis sin
commonly that is the cause of all that deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and ill-favouredness, that now cleaveth to
us, and that also rendereth us so dishonourable
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:102285:22"/>
at our death; but now at our rising, we being
raised incorruptible, we shall appear in such
perfections, and that of all sorts belonging to
the Body, that all the beauty and comeliness,
sweetness and amiableness, that hath at any
time been in this World, it shall be swallowed
up a thousand times told with this glory. The
<hi>Psalmist</hi> saith of Christ, <hi>That he was fairer
than the Children of men,</hi> Psal. 45. 2. and that
as I believe, in his outward man, as well as in
his inward part, He was the exactest, purest,
compleatest, and beautifullest Creature that
ever God made, <hi>Isa. 42. 14. Col. 1. 18. Till his
visage was so marred by his persecutions: for in
all things he had, and shall have, the preheminence.</hi>
Why our Bodies at our Resurrection, will not
onely be as free from sin, as his was before he
died; but also as free from all other infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
as he was after he was raised again. In a
word, if incorruptibleness can put a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
upon our Bodies, when they arise, we shall
have it. There shall be no lame legs, nor
Crump-shoulders, no blare-eyes, nor yet
wrinkled faces, <hi>Phil. 3. 20, 21. He shall change
our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his
glorious Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, all the glory that a glorified Soul
can help this Body to, it at this day shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy.
That Soul that hath been these hundreds or
thousands of years in the Heavens, soaking in
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:102285:22"/>
the Bosom of Christ, it shall in a moment come
spangling into the Body again, and inhabit
every member and vein of the Body, as it did
before its departure. That Spirit of God also,
that took its leave of the Body, when it went
to the Grave, shall now in all perfection dwell
in this Body again I tell you, the Body at this
day, will shine brighter than the face of <hi>Moses</hi>
or <hi>Stephen,</hi> even as bright as the Sun, the Stars,
and Angels. <hi>When Christ who is our life shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
we shall appear with him in glory, Exod.</hi> 34.
29. 35. <hi>Acts 6. 15. Dan. 12. 3. Mat. 13. 42, 43.
Luk. 20. 26. Col.</hi> 3. 3, 4.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is raised in Power. While we
are here, we are attended with so many weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
and infirmities, that in time the least sin
or sickness is too hard for us, and taketh away
both our strength, our beauty, our dayes, our
breath and life, and all. But behold, we are
raised in power, in that power that all these
things are as far below us, as a Grashopper is
below a Gyant, at the first appearance of us,
the World will tremble. <hi>Job 38. 17. Judges</hi> 16.
3. Behold the Gates of death, and the bars of
the Grave are now carried away on our shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
as <hi>Sampson</hi> carried away the Gates of
the City. Death quaketh, and destruction fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
down dead at our feet: What then can
stand before us? We shall then carry that
Grace, Majesty, Terrour, and commanding
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:102285:23"/>
power in our souls, that our countenances shall
be like Lightning, compare <hi>Luke</hi> 20. 36. with
<hi>Mat. 28. 2, 3. For this mortall must put on im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality,
and this corruptible must put on incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption:
So when this corruptible, shall have put
on incorruption, and this mortall, shall have put on
immortality: then shall be brought to passe that
saying which is written, Death is swallowed up of
Victory.</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 53, 54.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It is raised a spiritual Body. This
is the last particular, and is indeed the reason
of the other three; it is an incorruptible Body,
because it is a spiritual one; it is a glorious
Body, because it is a spiritual one; it doth
rise in power, because it is a spiritual Body.
When the Body is buried, or sown in the
Earth, it is a Body corruptible, dishonourable,
weak and natural: but when it ariseth, it doth
rise incorruptible, glorious, powerfully, and
Spiritual. So that so far as incorruption is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
corruption, glory above dishonour, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull
above weakness, and spiritual above na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall:
So great an alteration will there be in
our Body, when raised again. And yet it is
this Body and not another, this in nature,
though changed into a far more glorious State;
A thousand times further, then if a Hoggard
was changed to be an Emperour. Mark, <hi>It is
sown a natural Body:</hi> a very fit word; for
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:102285:23"/>
though there dwell never so much of the Spirit
and Grace of God in it while it liveth, yet so
soon as the Soul is separate from it, so soon also
doth the Spirit of God separate from it; and
so will continue while the day of its rising be
come. Therefore it is laid into the Earth, a
meer Lump of Man's Nature: <hi>It is sown a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Body:</hi> But now at the day, <hi>when the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
shall be no more,</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> saith, <hi>Job</hi> 14. 12.
Then <hi>the Trump shall sound, even the Trump of
God, and, in a moment, the Dead shall be raised in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible,
glorious, and spiritual,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 52.
1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 24. 16, 17. So that I say, the Body
when it ariseth, will be so swallowed up of life
and immortality, that it will be, as if it had lost
its own Humane Nature; though, in truth, the
same substantial real Nature is every whit
there still. 'Tis the same [<hi>it</hi>] that riseth, that
was sown; <hi>it</hi> is sown, <hi>it</hi> is raised: <hi>it</hi> is sown, <hi>it</hi>
is raised, saith the Apostle. You know, that
things which are candied, by the Art of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecary,</hi>
they are so swallow'd up with the
sweetness and vertue of that in which it is can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died,
that they are now, as though they had no
other Nature, than that in which they are boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
When yet, in truth, the thing candied doth
still retain its own proper Nature and Essence;
though by vertue of its being candied, it loseth
its former sourness, bitterness, stinking, smell,
or the like. Just thus, at the last day, it will be
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:102285:24"/>
with our Bodies; We shall be so candied, by
being swallow'd up of Life, as before is shewed,
That we shall be, as if we were all Spirit, when
in truth, it is but this Body that is swallowed up
of Life: And it must needs be, that our Nature
still remain, otherwise it cannot be <hi>Us</hi> that sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll
be in Heaven, but <hi>something besides Us.</hi> Let us
lose our proper Humane Nature, and we lose
absolutely our Being &amp; so are annihalated into
nothing. Wherefore, <hi>it,</hi> the same <hi>it,</hi> that is
sown a Natural Body, it shall rise a Spiritual
Body.</p>
               <p>But again, as I said, concerning Things that
are candied; our Body, when thus risen, it shall
lose all that sourness and stinck, that now, by
reason of sinne and infirmity, cleaveth to it:
neither shall its lumpishness, or unweildiness,
be any impediment to its acting after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Angels. Christ hath shewed us, what our
Body at our Resurrection shall be, by shewing
of us, in his Word, what his Body was at, and
after, his Resurrection: We read, that his Body,
after he was risen from the Dead, though it yet
retained the very <hi>same Flesh and Bones,</hi> that did
hang upon the Cross, yet how Angelical was
it at all times, upon all occasions! He could
come in to his Disciples with that very Body,
when the Doors were shut upon them: He
could, at pleasure, to their amazement, appear
in the twinckling of an Eye, in the midst of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:102285:24"/>
them: He could be visible and invisible as he
pleased, when he sat at meat with them. In a
word, he could pass and re-pass, ascend and
descend in that Body, with far more pleasure
and ease, than the Bird by the Art of her
Wing, <hi>Luk 24. 38, 39, 40, 41. Joh. 20. 24, 25.
Luk. 24. 31, 32, 50, 51. Joh. 20. 19, 26. Act. 1.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Mark 16. 19. Eph.</hi>
4. 7, 8, 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now, I say, as we have in this World born
the Image of our first Father; so, at that Day,
we shall have the Image of Jesus Christ, and be
as he is.</hi> As is the Earthly, such are they that
are Earthly; and as is the Heavenly, such are they
that are Heavenly; and as we have been the Image
of the Earthly, we shall (<hi>at our Resurrection</hi>)
bear the Image of the Heavenly: It is so in part
now, but shall so be in perfection then, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.
48, 49.</p>
               <p>To mount up to Heaven, and to descend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
at pleasure, shall, with us, in that Day, be
ordinary. If there were Ten Thousand Bars
of Iron, or Walls of Brass, to separate between
us, and our pleasure and desire, at that Day, they
should as easily be pierced by us, as is the Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>web,
or Air by the Beams of the Sun: And the
Reason is, Because to <hi>the Spirit,</hi> wherewith we
shall be unconceiveably filled at that Day, <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is unpossible,</hi> Mat. 10. 27. And the working
of it at that Day, shall be in that nature and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:102285:25"/>
measure, as to swallow up all impossibilities.
<hi>He shall change our vile Body, and fashion it like
unto his glorious Body;</hi> Now mark, <hi>according to
the working, whereby he is able to subdue all things
unto himself,</hi> Phil. 3. 21. As who should say, I
know that there are many things, that in this
World hinder us from having our Bodies like
the Body of Christ; but when God shall raise
us from the Dead, because he will then have
our Body like the Body of his Son: He will
stretch forth such a power to work upon, and
in our Body, that he will remove all impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
and hinderances.</p>
               <p>Nay further, we do not onely see what ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
the Spirit will have in our Body, by the
carriage of Christ, after his Resurrection; but
even by many a Saint before their Death. The
Spirit used to catch <hi>Elijah</hi> away, no man could
tell whether. It carryed <hi>Ezekiel</hi> hither and
thither: It carryed Christ from the Top of the
Pinacle of the Temple into <hi>Galilee;</hi> through it
he walked on the Sea; the Spirit caught away
<hi>Philip</hi> from the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> and carryed him as
far as <hi>Azotus, 1 King. 17. 11, 12. 2 King. 2. 11.
Ezek 3. 14. Luke 4. 14. Matth. 14. 25. Act.</hi> 8.
39. 40.</p>
               <p>Thus the great God hath given us a Tast of
the power and glory that is in himself, and how
easily it will help us, by its possessing of us at
the Resurrection, to act and do like Angels; as
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:102285:25"/>
Christ s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ith, <hi>They that shall be counted worthy of
that World, and of the Resurrection from the
Dead, they shall not die, but be equal to the Angels,</hi>
Luk. 23. 36.</p>
               <p>Further, as the Body by being thus spiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized,
shall be as I have said; so again it must
needs be, that hereby all the Service of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and Faculties of the Soul, must be infinitely
inlarged also. Now <hi>we shall see him as he is,
and now we shall know, even as we are known,</hi> 1 Joh.
3. 2. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 12.</p>
               <p>First, now we shall see him; to wit, Christ
in his Glory: Not by Revelation onely, as we
do now, <hi>but then Face to Face;</hi> and he will
have us with him, <hi>to this very end,</hi> Joh. 17. 24.
Though <hi>John</hi> was in the Spirit, when he had the
Vision of Christ, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 17. yet it made him
fall at his Feet as dead; and also turned <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi>'s
Beauty into Corruption, <hi>Dan.</hi> 10. 8. It was
so glorious, and so over-weighing a Glory, that
he appeared in; but we shall, at the Day of our
Resurrection, be so furnished, that we shall
with the <hi>Eagle,</hi> be able to look upon the Sun in
his strength: We shall then, I say, see <hi>Him</hi> as
he is; <hi>who now is in the Light, that no Eye hath
seen, nor any man can see till that Day,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.
16.</p>
               <p>Now we shall see into all Things: There
shall not be any thing hid from us; there shall
not be a Saint, a Prophet, or saved Soul, small
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:102285:26"/>
or great; but we shall then perfectly know
them: Also, all the Works of Creation, Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and Redemption, and shall see and know as
throughly, all the Things of Heaven, and Earth,
and Hell, even as perfectly, as now we know
our <hi>A, B, C.</hi> For the Spirit, with which we shall
in every Crany of Soul and Body, be filled, I
say, that searche<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Abraham</hi> could, by it, tell to a day, how long
his Seed should be under Persecution in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,

was done in the King of <hi>Assyria</hi>'s Bed-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,

<hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s Wife, so soon, yea before her Feet

1 <hi>King.</hi> 14. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</p>
               <p>The Prophet of <hi>Judah</hi> could tell by this,
what God would do to <hi>Bethel,</hi> for the Idolatry
there committed; and could also point out the
man by name that should do the Execution,
long before he was born, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 13. 2. What shall
I say, <hi>Enoch</hi> by it could tell, what should be
done at the end of the World, <hi>Jud.</hi> 14, 15. How
did the Prophets, to a circumstance, prophecie
of Christ's Birth, his Death, his Burial, of their

the very first word, call <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> by
their Names, when they appeared to Christ in
the Holy Mount, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9. 33. He is very igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the operation of the Spirit of God, that
scrupleth these Things: But now, I say, if these
Things have been done, seen, and known, by
Spiritual men, while their knowledge hath been
but in part, how shall we know, see, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern,
when that which is perfect is come?
Which will be at the Resurrection; <hi>It is raised
a Spiritual Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus, in few words, have I shewed you the
truth of the Resurrection of the Just, and also
the manner of their Rising: Had I judged it
convenient, I might have much inlarged on
each particular, and have added many more:
For the Doctrine of the Resurrection, however
question'd by Hereticks, and Erroneous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
yet is such a Truth, that almost all the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scriptures of God point at, and center in
it.</p>
               <p>God hath, from the beginning of the World,
shewed to us, that our Body must be with him,
as well as our Soul, in the Kingdom of Heaven. I
say, he hath shew'd; first he hath shewed us, how
he will deal with those that are alive at Christs
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:102285:27"/>
coming, by his translating of <hi>Enoch,</hi> Gen. 5. 24.
<hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 5. and taking him Body and Soul to
himself: As also, by his catching of <hi>Elias,
1 King.</hi> 2. 10, 11. up Body and Soul into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
in a Fiery Chariot.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He hath often put us in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of the Rising of those that are Dead, at
that Day.</p>
               <p>First, By the Faith he gave <hi>Abraham,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Offering of his Son: For when he
offered him, he accounted that God was able to
raise him up, even from the Dead: <hi>From whence
also he received him in a Figure.</hi> In a Figure of
the Resurrection of Christ, for <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,
and of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Resurrection by
Christ at the last Day, for his Glorification,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 19.</p>
               <p>Secondly, By the Faith he gave <hi>Joseph,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming
his Bones; which Charge, the Godly
in <hi>Egypt</hi> did diligently observe, and to that end,
did keep them four hundred years; and, at
length, carryed them, I say, from <hi>Egypt</hi> to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,
Heb.</hi> 11. 22. which was a Tipe of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
carryed in our Body, from this World to
Heaven.</p>
               <p>Besides, How oft did God give power to
his Prophets, Servants, and Christ Jesus, to
raise some that was now dead, and some that
had been long so; and all, no doubt, to put the
present Generations; as also the Generations
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:102285:27"/>
yet unborn, in mind of the Resurrection of the
Dead. To this end, I say, how was the <hi>Shu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namites</hi>
Son raised from the dead? 2 <hi>King.</hi> 4.
The man also at the touching of the bones of
<hi>Elisha, 2 King.</hi> 13. 20, 21. Together with
the body of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> with <hi>Jairus</hi> Daughter,
and <hi>Tabitha,</hi> and many others, <hi>Luke 8. 53,
54, 55. Joh. 11. 43, 44, 45. Acts</hi> 9. 40, 41.
who after their Soul was departed from them,
<hi>Lazarus</hi> lying in his grave four dayes, were
all raised to life again, and lived with that
very Body out of which the Soul, at their
death, had departed.</p>
               <p>But above all, that notable place in <hi>Matthew,</hi>
at the Resurrection of the Lord Jesus, gives
us a notable fore-word of the Resurrection
of the Just: Saith the Text, <hi>And the graves
were opened, and many BODIES of Saints
which slept, arose, and came out of their graves
after his Resurrection, and went into the holy
City, and appeared unto many,</hi> Matth. 27. 50, 51,
52, 53.</p>
               <p>When the Authour to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> had
given us a Catalogue of the Worthies of the
Old Testament, he saith at last, <hi>These all died
in Faith.</hi> In the faith of what? That they
should lie and rot in their graves eternally?
No, verily this is the Faith of Ranters, not
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:102285:28"/>
of Christians. They all died in faith, that
they should rise again; and therefore counted
this World not worth the living in [upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
terms] that after death they <hi>might
obtain a better Resurrection,</hi> Heb. 11. 13,
35.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis also worth the Considering, that of</hi>
Paul <hi>to the</hi> Philippians, <hi>where he saith, That</hi>
he was Confident, that that God, that had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
a good work in them, would perform it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
the day of Christ, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 6.</p>
               <p>Which day of Christ, was not the day of
their Conversion, for that was past with them
already, they were now the Children of God;
but this Day of Christ, it is the same which
in other places is called the Day when he shall
come with the sound of the last Trump to
raise the Dead. For you must know, That the
Work of Salvation is not at an end with them
that are now in Heaven; no, nor ever will,
untill (as I shewed you before) their Bodies
be raised again. God, as I have told you,
hath made our Bodies the Members of Christ,
and God doth not count us thoroughly saved,
untill our Bodies be as well redeemed and
ransomed out of the grave and death, as our
Soul from the Curse of the Law, and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of Sin,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:102285:28"/>
Though Gods Saints have felt the power
of much of his grace, and have had many a
sweet word fulfilled on them; yet one word
will be unfulfilled on their particular person,
so long as the grave can shut her mouth upon
them: But, as I said before, when the gates
of death do open before them, and the barrs
of the grave do fall asunder; then shall be
brought to pass that saying that is written,
<hi>Death is swallowed up of Victory:</hi> and then
will they hear that most pleasant voyce, <hi>Awake,
and sing, ye that dwell in the dust; for thy dew
is as the dew of herbs, and the Earth shall cast
forth her dead,</hi> Isa. 26. 19. Thus much touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the truth of the Resurrection of the Just,
with the manner of their rising.</p>
               <p>Now you must know, That the time of the
rising of these Just, will be at the Coming
of the Lord: For when they arise, nay just
before they are raised, the Lord Jesus Christ
will appear in the Clouds in flaming fire with
all his mighty Angels; the effect of which
appearing, will be the rising of the dead, &amp;c.
<hi>For the Lord himself shall descend from Heaven
with a shout,</hi> saith <hi>Paul, and with the voice of the
Arch-Angell, and with the Trump of God, and
the dead shall rise,</hi> 1 Thess. 7, 8. 2 Thess. 4.
16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 52.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:102285:29"/>
Now at the time of the Lords Coming,
there will be found in the World alive both
Saints and Sinners. As for the Saints that
then shall be found alive, they shall so soon as
all the Saints are raised out of their graves, not
die, but be changed and swallowed up of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruption,
immortality, and glory; and have
the Soul-spiritual Translation, as the raised
Saints shall have; as he saith, <hi>We shall not all
die, or sleep, but we shall all be changed in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
in the twinkling of an eye; <hi>For the Trump
shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible,
and we shall be changed.</hi> And again, <hi>For
the Lord himself shall descend from Heaven
with a shout, with the voice of the Arch-Angel,
and with the Trump of God, and the dead in Christ
shall rise first, and then we which are alive and
remain, shall be caught up together with them in
the Clouds, to meet the Lord in the Ayr, and so
shall we ever be with the Lord.</hi> As he saith also
in another place, <hi>He shall judg the quick and
the dead at his appearing, and his Kingdome,</hi>
1 <hi>Cor. 15. 52. 1 Thess. 4. 15, 16, 17. and 2 Tim.</hi>
4. 1.</p>
               <p>Now when the Saints that sleep shall be
raised thus incorruptible, powerful, glorious,
and spiritual; and also those that then shall be
found alive, made like them: Then forthwith,
before the unjust are raised, the Saints shall
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:102285:29"/>
appear before the Judgment Seat of the Lord
Jesus Christ, there to give an account to their
Lord the Judge, of all things they have done;
and to receive a reward for their good accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their labour.</p>
               <p>They shall rise, I say, before the Wicked,
they being themselves the proper <hi>Children of
the Resurrection;</hi> that is, Those that must have
all the glory of it, both as to preheminencie,
and sweetness; and therefore they are said,
when they rise, to <hi>rise from the dead;</hi> that is,
in their rising, they leave the reprobate World
behind them, <hi>Luke 20. 35, 36. Acts 3. 15.
Acts 4. 10. Acts 13. 30. Joh.</hi> 12. 1, 9, 17.
And it must be so, because also the Saints will
have done their Account, and be set upon the
Throne with Christ as Kings and Princes with
him, to Judge the World, when the wicked
world are raised. The Saints shall Judg the
World; they shall judge Angels: yea, they
shall sit upon the Thrones of Judgment to do
it. But to pass that, 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 2, 3. Psal.</hi> 122.
5.</p>
               <p>Now when the Saints are raised, as ye have
heard, they must give an account of all things,
in general, that they have done, while they
were in the World: Of all things, I say, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be good or bad.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:102285:30"/>
                  <hi>First, of all their bad; but mark, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Consideration of Vagabonds, Slaves
and Sinners, but as Sons, Stewards, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of the Lord Jesus. That this shall be,
it is evident from divers places of the Holy
Scriptures: First</hi> Paul <hi>saith,</hi> We must all
stand before the Judgment Seat of Christ,
<hi>We Saints.</hi> For it is written, As I live,
saith the Lord, every Knee shall bowe to me,
and every tongue shall confess to God. So
then every one of us shall give an account
of himself to God. <hi>Again,</hi> Wherefore we
labour, that whether present or absent, we
may be accepted of him: for we must all
appear before the Judgment Seat of Christ,
that every one of us may receive the things
done in his body, according to what he hath
done, whether it be good, or whether it be
evil, <hi>Rom. 14. 10, 11, 12. 2 Cor.</hi> 5.
10.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, God loveth his People, but yet
he loveth not their sins, nor any thing they
do, though with the greatest zeal for him, if it
be contrary to his Word; Wherefore as truly
as God will give a reward to his Saints and
Children for all that they have indeed well
done. So truly will he at this day distinguish
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:102285:30"/>
their good and bad: and when both are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
by the righteous Judgment of Christ: he
will burn up their bad, with all their labour,
travail, and paints in it for ever. He can tell
how to save his people, <hi>and yet take vengeance
on their Inventions,</hi> Psal. 99. 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That is an observable place, in the first
Epistle of</hi> Paul <hi>to the</hi> Corinthians, <hi>and the third
Chapter,</hi> If any man build, saith he, upon
this foundation (<hi>Christ</hi>) Gold, Silver,
Pretious Stones, Wood, Hay, Stubble, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
mans work shall be manifest, for the day
shall declare it, because it shall be revealed
by fire, and the fire shall try every mans
work of what sort it is. If any mans work
shall abide that he hath built thereupon, he
shall receive a reward. If any mans work
shall be burnt, that man shall suffer losse,
but he himself shall be saved, yet so as by
fire, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.</p>
               <p>Now observe first, as I said before, the
<hi>Foundation</hi> is Christ, <hi>Vers.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>2. The <hi>Gold, Silver,</hi> and <hi>Pretious Stones,</hi>
that here are said to be built upon him, are
all the actings in Faith and Love according to
the Word, that the Saints are found doing for
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:102285:31"/>
his sake in the World, 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 7. Rev.</hi> 3.
18.</p>
               <p>3. To build on him <hi>Wood, Hay, and Stubble,</hi>
it is to build, together with what is right in it
self, humane Inventions, and carnall Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances;
fathering them still on God and his
allowance.</p>
               <p>4. The <hi>Fire</hi> that here you read of, it is the
pure Word and Law of God, <hi>Jer. 23. 29.
Joh.</hi> 12. 48.</p>
               <p>5. The day that here you read of, it is the
day of Christ's coming to Judgment, to reveal
the hidden things of darkness, and to make
manifest the Counsels of the heart, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.
5.</p>
               <p>6. At this day, the Gold, Silver, pretious
Stones, Wood, Hay, and Stubble, and that
of every man, shall be tryed by this fire, that
it may be manifest of what sort it is; the <hi>Wind,
the Rain, and Flouds, beat now as vehemently
against the house upon the Rock, as against that
on the Sand,</hi> Luke 6. 48, 49.</p>
               <p>Observe again,</p>
               <p>1. That the Apostle speaks here of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
not of the reprobate, <hi>He himself shall be
saved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. That this saved man may have Wood,
Hay, and Stubble; that is, things that will not
abide the tryal.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:102285:31"/>
3. That neither this mans goodness, not
yet Gods love to him, shall hinder all his
Wood; Hay, or stubble for coming on the stage,
<hi>Every mans work shall be manifest: the fire shall
try every mans work, of what sort it is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Thus, a good man shall see all his Wood,
Hay, and stubble burnt up in the tryal before
his face.</p>
               <p>5. That good man then shall suffer loss, or
the loss of all things that are not then accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Word of God. <hi>If any mans works shall
be burnt</hi> (or any of them) <hi>he shall suffer loss; but
he himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire,</hi> that
is, yet so as that all that ever he hath done,
shall be tryed, and squared by the Word of
God.</p>
               <p>From all which, it must be unavoidably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
that the whole Body of the Elect must
count with their Lord for all things they have
done, whether good or bad, and that he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
all their bad, with the purity of his word,
yea, and all their pains, travel, and labour that
they have spent about it. I am perswaded,
that there are now many things done by the
best of Saints, that then they will gladly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own
and be ashamed of: yea, which they have
and do still do with great devotion. Alas, what
gross things do some of the Saints in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
father upon God, and do reckon him the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:102285:32"/>
Authour thereof, and so he also prompts them
forward to the doing thereof, and doth give
them his presence in the performance of them!
yea, and as they father many superstitions and
Scriptureless things upon him: so they die in
the same Opinion, and never come in this
World, to the sight of their evill and ignorance
herein. But now the Judgment day is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
time wherein every thing shall be fet in
its proper place; that which is of God in its
place, and that which is not, shall now be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
and made manifest. In many things
now, we offend all, and then we shall see the
many offences we have committed, and shall
our selves judge them as they are. The Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
is in this World, so candid a Creature,
that take him when he is not under some great
temptation, and he will ingeniously confess to
his God, before all men, how he hath sinned
and transgressed against his Father; and will
fall down at the feet of God, and cry, <hi>Thou art
righteous, for I have sinned;</hi> and thou art graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
that notwithstanding my sin, thou shouldest
save me: now I say, if the Christian is so
simple and plain-hearted with God, in the days
of his imperfection, when he is accompanied
with many infirmities and temptations: how
freely will he confess and acknowledge his
miscarriages, when he comes before his Lord
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:102285:32"/>
and Saviour: absolutely stript of all tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and imperfection. <hi>Rom. 14. 11. Phil.</hi> 2.
10, 11. <hi>As I live,</hi> saith the Lord, <hi>every knee
shall how to me, and every Tongue shall confess to
God.</hi> Every knee shall bow, and reverence
God the Creator, and Christ the Redeemer of
the World; and every Tongue shall confess,
that his will alone ought by them to have bin
obeyed in all things; and shall confess also,
and that most naturally and freely. I mean, the
Saints shall in how many things they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
mistaken, deluded, and drawn aside
in their intended devotion and honour to
God.</p>
               <p>But yet take notice, that in this day, when
the Saints are thus counting for their evill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their Saviour and Judg: they shall not
then, as now, at the remembrance and confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of sin, be filled with that guilt, confusion
and shame that now through the weakness of
Faith attendeth their Souls: neither shall they
in the least be grieved or offended, that God
hath before the Angels and the rest of their
holy Brethren, laid open to a tittle their infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
from the least and first, to the biggest
and last.</p>
               <p>For first, the God to whom they confess all,
they will now more perfectly then ever, see he
doth love them, and free them from all, even
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:102285:33"/>
when and before they confess and acknowledg
them to him, and they shall, I say, have their
Soul so full of the ravishing raptures of the
life and glory that now they are in, that they
shall be of it swallowed up in that measure,
and manner, that neither fear nor guilt, nor
confusion can come near them, or touch them.
Their Judge is their Saviour, their Husband,
and Head: who, though he will bring every
one of them for all things to Judgment, yet he
will keep them for ever out of condemnation,
and any thing that tendeth that way. <hi>Perfect
love casts out fear,</hi> even while we are here:
much more then, when we are with our Saviour
our Jesus, <hi>being passed from death to life.</hi> John 5.
24. 1 John 4. 18.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Saints at this day, shall
have their hearts and Souls so wrapped up in
the pleasure of God their Saviour, that it shall
be their delight, to see all things, though once
never so near and dear unto them; yet now to
perish, if not according to his word and will:
<hi>Thy will be done,</hi> is to be always our Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
here; but to delight to see it done in
all things, though it tend never so much to the
distruction of what we love: to delight, I say,
to see it done in the height and perfection of
delight: it will be when we come to Heaven,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:102285:33"/>
or when the Lord shall come to judge the
World. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 10.</p>
               <p>But thirdly, The sole end of the counting
of the Saints at the day of God, it will be, not
onely for the vindication of the righteousness,
holiness, and purity of the Word, neither will
it center onely in the manifestation of the
knowledg and heart-discerning nature of
Christ (though both these will be in it. <hi>Revel.</hi>
2. 22, 23.) But their very remembrances and
sight of the sin and vanity that they have done
while here: it shall both set off, and heighten
the tender affections of their God unto them;
and also increase their joy and sweetness of
Soul; and clinging of heart to their God. Saints
while here, are swee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly sensible, that the sense
of sin, and the assurance of pardon, will make
famous work in their poor hearts. Ah; what
meltings without guilt! what humility with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
casting down! and what a sight of the
creatures nothingness yet without fear! will
this sense of sin work in the Soul. The sweetest
frame, the most heart-indearing frame, that
possibly, a Christian can get into, while in this
World, is to have a warm sight of sin, and
of a Saviour upon the heart at one time. Now
it weeps not for fear, and through torment, but
by vertue of constraining grace and mercy, and
is at this very time, so far off of disquietness of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:102285:34"/>
heart, by reason of the fight of its wickedness,
that it is driven into an extasie, by reason of the
love and mercy that is mingled with the sense
of sin in the Soul. The heart never sees so
much of the power of mercy as now, nor of the
vertue, value, and excellency of Christ in all
his Offices as now, and the Tongue so sweetly
inlarged to proclaim and cry up grace as now;
now will Christ come to <hi>be glorified in his
Saints, and admired in them that believe.</hi> 2 Thes.
1. 10, 11.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, though the Saints receive by
Faith the forgiveness of sins in this life, and so
are passed from death to life; yet again, Christ
Jesus, and God his Father, will have every
one of these sins reckoned up again, and
brought fresh upon the stage in the day of
Judgment, that they may see and be sensible
for ever, what grace and mercy hath laid hold
upon them. And this I take to be the Reason
of that remarkable saying of the Apostle
Peter. <hi>Repent therefore and be converted, that
your sins may be blotted out, when the times of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing
shall come from the presence of the Lord,
and he shall send Jesus Christ, who before was
preached unto you, whom the Heaven must receive
till the restitution of all things, spoken of by the
mouth of all the holy Prophets since the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan.</hi>
Acts 3. 19, 20, 21.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:102285:34"/>
If a sense of some sin (for who sees all? <hi>Psa.</hi> 19.
12.) and a sight of the love of God, will here
so work upon the spirit of the godly: What
will a sight of all sin do, when together with it
they are personally present with their Lord
and Saviour?</p>
               <p>Yea, if a sight of some sins, with a possibility
of pardon, will make the heart love, reverence,
and fear with guiltless and heart-affecting
fears: what will a general sight of all sin, and
together with them an eternall acquittance
from them, work on the heart of the Saint for
ever?</p>
               <p>Yea, I say again, if a sight of sin, and the
love of God, will make such work in that Soul
where yet there is unbelief, blindness, mistrust,
and forgetfulness: what will a sight of sin do
in that Soul, who is swallowed up of love, who
is sinless, and temptationless; who hath all the
faculties of Soul and Body strained, by love
and grace, to the highest pin of perfection, that
is possible to be in glory injoyed and posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed?
O the wisdom and goodness of God, that
he at this day, should so cast about the worst of
our things, even those that naturally tend to
sink us, and damnus, for our great advantage!
<hi>All things that shall work together for good, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
to them that love God.</hi> Rom. 8. 28. Those
sins that brought a curse upon the whole
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:102285:35"/>
World, that spilt the heart-blood of our dearest
Saviour, and that laid his tender Soul under the
flaming wrath of God, shall by his wisdom and
love, tend to the exaltation of his Grace, and
the inflaming of our affections to him for
ever and ever. <hi>Revel.</hi> 5. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,
14.</p>
               <p>'Twill not be thus with Devils, 'twill not be
thus with Reprobates; the saved onely have
this priviledge peculiar to themselves: (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to vary a little from the matter in hand,
will God make that use of sin, even in our
counting for it, that shall in this manner work
for our advantage? why then, let Saints also
make that advantage of their sin, as to glorifie
God thereby, which is to be done, not by say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Let us do evill that good may come,</hi> or, <hi>let us
sin that Grace may abound;</hi> but by taking occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
by the sin that is past to set the Crown up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Head of the Christ for our justification.
Continually looking upon it, so as to press us
to cleave close to the Lord Jesus, to grace and
mercy through him, and to the keeping of us
humble for ever, under all his dispensations
and cariages to us.</p>
               <p>Now having counted for all their evil, and
confessed to Gods glory, how they fell short,
and did not the truth in this, or that, or other
particulars; and having received their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:102285:35"/>
acquittance from the Lord and Judg, in
the sight of both Angels and Saints: forthwith
the Lord Jesus will make inquiry into all the
good and holy actions and deeds they did do in
the World. Now there shall all things be
reckoned up, from the very first good thing
that was done by <hi>Adam</hi> or <hi>Abel,</hi> to the last that
will fall out to be done in the World. The
good of all the holy Prophets, of all Apostles,
Pastors, Teachers, and helps in the Church:
here also will be brought forth and to light, all
the good Cariages of Masters of Families, of
Parents, of Children, of Servants, of Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
or what ever good thing <hi>any man doth;</hi>
but to be general and short, first, here will be
a recompence for all that have sincerely labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Word and Doctrine, I say, a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
for all the Souls they have saved by their
Word, and watered by the same.</p>
               <p>Now shall <hi>Paul</hi> the Planter, and <hi>Apollo</hi> the
Waterer, with every one of their Companions,
receive the reward that is according to their
works. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6, 7, 8.</p>
               <p>Now all the Preaching, praying, watching,
and labour thou hast been at, in thy endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to catch men from Satan to God, shall be
rewarded with spangling glory. Not a Soul
thou hast converted to the Lord Jesus, nor a
Soul thou hast comforted, strengthned, or
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:102285:36"/>
helped by thy wholsom Counsel, admonition,
and comfortable speech; but it shall stick, as
a Pearl in <hi>that Crown which the Lord the
Righteous Judge shall give thee at that day.</hi>
2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 7, 8. That is, if thou dost it willingly,
delighting to lift up the name of God among
men; if thou doest it with love, and longing
after the Salvation of sinners, (otherwise thou
wilt have onely thy labour for thy pains, and
no more: if I do this willingly, I have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
but if against my will, a dispensation
of the Gospel is committed to my charge.
1 <hi>Cor. 9. 17. Phil.</hi> 1. 15. But I say, if thou do
it graciously, then a reward followeth; <hi>for
what is our hope, or joy, or Crown of rejoycing, are
not even ye, saith</hi> Paul, <hi>in the presence of our
Lord Jesus Christ at his coming, for ye are our
glory and joy.</hi> 1 Thes. 2. 19, 20. Let him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that Christ hath put into this Harvest, take
comfort in the midst of all his sorrow, and
know, that God acknowledgeth that he that
converteth a sinner from the errour of his way,
doth even save that Soul from death, <hi>and cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
a multitude of sins.</hi> Wherefore labour to
convert, labour to water, labour to build up,
<hi>and to feed the flock of God which is among you,
taking the oversight thereof not by constraint; but
willingly, not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;
and when the chief Shepheard shall appear, ye shall
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:102285:36"/>
receive a Crown of Glory that fadeth not away</hi>
Jam. 5. 20. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 2, 3, 4.</p>
               <p>Secondly, And as the Ministers of Christs
Gospel shall at this day be recompensed: so
shall also those more private Saints be with ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
affections, and love looked on, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
for all their work and labour of love,
which they have shewed to the name of <hi>Christ,</hi>
in ministring to his Saints, and suffering for his
sake. <hi>Whatsoever good thing any man doth, the
same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be
bond or free.</hi> Heb. 6. 10. Ephes. 6. 8. Ah! little
do the People of God think, how largely and
thorowly, God will at that day, own and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
all the good and holy acts of his
People. Every bit, every drop, every rag, and
every nights harbour, though but in a wisp of
straw, shall be rewarded in that day before men
and Angels. <hi>Whosoever shall give to drink, to
one of these little ones, a Cup of cold water, onely
in the name of a Disciple: verily I say unto you,</hi>
saith Christ, <hi>He shall in no wise loose a Disciples
reward.</hi> Mat. 10. 40, 41, 42. <hi>Therefore when
thou makest a Feast,</hi> saith he, <hi>Call the poor, the
maimed, the lame, and the blind, and thou shalt be
blessed; for they cannot recompence thee, for thou
shalt be recompenced at the Resurrection of the
Just.</hi> Luk. 14. 13, 14. If there be any repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
among the godly at this day, it will be,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:102285:37"/>
because the Lord Jesus in his person, members,
and word, was no more owned, honoured, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained,
and provided for by them, when
they were in this World: For it will be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishing
to all, to see what notice the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
will then take of every Widows mite. He,
I say, will call to mind, even all those acts of
me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cy and kindness, which thou hast shewed
to him, when thou wast among men. I say, he
will remember, cry up, and proclaim before
Angels and Saints, those very acts of thine,
which thou hast either forgotten, or through
bashfulness wilt not at that day count worth the
owning. He will reckon them up so fast,
and so fully, that thou wilt cry Lord,
<hi>When did I do this? and when did I do
the other? When saw we thee a hungry,
and fed thee? or a thirst, and gave thee
drink? When saw we thee a stranger, and
took thee in? or naked, and cloathed thee?
or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and
came unto thee? and the King shall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
and say unto them, verily I say unto
you, in as much as ye did it unto one of the
least of these my Brethren, ye did it unto
me.</hi> Mat. 25. 37, 38, 39, 40. The good
works of some are manifest before hand,
and they that are otherwise cannot be hid.
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:102285:37"/>
1 Tim. 5. 25. Whatever thou hast done to one
of the least of these my Brethren, thou hast
done it unto me. I felt the nourishment of thy
food, and the warmth of thy fleece. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
thy loving and holy visits, when my poor
members were sick, and in prison, and the like.
When they were strangers, and wanderers in
the World, thou tookest them in. <hi>Well thou
good and faithful Servant, enter Thou into the Joy
of thy Lord.</hi> Matth. 25. 21, 22, 23, 34, 35,
36.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, Here also will be a reward for all
that hardness, and Christian induring of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
that thou hast met with for thy Lord,
while thou wast in the World. Here now will
Christ begin from the greatest suffering, even
to the least, and bestow a reward on them all:
from the blood of the suffering Saint, to the loss
of an hair: nothing shall go unrewarded.
Heb. 11. 36, 37, 38, 39, 40. 2 Cor.</hi> 4.
8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. For these light
afflictions which are but for a moment, they
work out for us, a far more exceeding, and
eternall weight of glory. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17.
Behold by the Scriptures, how God hath
recorded the sufferings of his People, and
also how he hath promised to reward them.
Blessed are they that are persecuted for
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:102285:38"/>
righteousness sake, for theirs is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Heaven. Blessed are ye, when men
shall revile you, and speak all manner of
evil against you, falsly for my sake, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce,
<hi>Luk.</hi> 6. 22, 23. leap for joy, and be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
glad, for great is your reward in
Heaven. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 16, 17, 18. And every
one that hath forsaken Houses, or Brethren,
or Sisters, or Father, or Mother, or Wife,
or Children, or Laws for my names sake,
shall receive an hundred fold, and shall
inherit everlasting life. <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.
29.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, There is also a reward at this
day, for all the more secret, and more retired
works of Christianity: there is not now one
act of faith in thy Soul, either upon Christ, or
against the Devil, and Antichrist; but it shall
in this day be found out, and <hi>praysed, honoured
and glorified; in the face of Heaven,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.
7.</p>
               <p>2. There is not one groan to God in secret,
against thy own lusts, and for more grace, light,
spirit, sanctification, and strength to go thorow
this World like a Christian; <hi>but it shall even at
the coming of Christ, be rewarded openly.</hi> Matth.
6. 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:102285:38"/>
3. There hath not one tear dropped from
thy tender eye against thy lusts, the love of this
World, or for more Communion with Jesus
Christ, but as it is now in the bottle of God; so
then it shall bring forth such plenty of reward,
that it shall return upon thee with abundance of
increase. <hi>Blessed are ye that weep now; for ye shall
laugh. Thou tell est my wonderings, and puttest my
tears into thy Bottle, are they not in thy Book? They
that sow in tears, shall reap in joy. He that goeth
forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed shall doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
come again, bringing his sheaves with him.</hi>
Psal. 56. 8. Psal. 126. 5 6. Luk. 6. 21.</p>
               <p>Having thus in brief shewed you something
concerning the <hi>Resurrection of the Saints,</hi> and
that they shall count with their Lord at his
coming, both for the burning up what was not
according to the truth, and rewarding them for
all their good. It remains, that I now in few
words, shew you something also of that with
which they shall be rewarded.</p>
               <p>First then, those that shall be found in the
day of their Resurrection, when they shall have
all their good things brought upon the stage;
they I say, that then shall be found the People
most laborious for God while here: they shall
at that day injoy the greatest portion of God,
or shall be possessed with most of the glory of
the God-head then. For that is the portion of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:102285:39"/>
Saints in general. <hi>Rom. 8. 17. Lam.</hi> 3. 24. And
why shall he that doth most for God in this
World, injoy most of him in that which is to
come? but because by doing and acting, the
heart, and every faculty of the Soul is inlarged,
and more capatiated, whereby more room is
made for glory. Every Vessel of Glory shall
at that day be full of it; but every one will
not be capable to contain a like measure. And
so if they should have it communicated to
them, would not be able to stand under it; for
there is <hi>an eternall weight in the glory that Saints
shall then injoy;</hi> and every Vessel must be at
that day filled, that is, have its heavenly load
of it. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17.</p>
               <p>All Christians have not the same injoyment
of God in this life, neither indeed were they
able to bear it, if they had it. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 2. But
those Christians that are most laborious for
God in this World, they have already most of
him in their Souls, and that not onely because
diligence in Gods wayes, is the meanes
whereby God communicates himself; but also
because thereby the senses are made more
strong, and able, by reason of use to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
God, and to discern both good and evill.
<hi>Heb. 5. 13, 14. Mat. 13. 11, 12. To him that
hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more
abundance.</hi> He that laid out his pound for his
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:102285:39"/>
Master, and gained ten therewith, he was made
Ruler over ten Cities; but he that by his
pound gained but five, he was made Ruler
over but five. <hi>Luk. 19. 16, 17, 18, 19. Dan.</hi> 1.
3, 4. Often, he that is best bred in his youth,
he is best able to manage most, when he is a
man touching things of this life) but alwayes
he that is best bred, and that is most in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
of God, and that so acts for him here: he
is the man that will be best able to injoy most of
God in the Kingdom of Heaven. It is observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
that <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Our afflictions work out for
us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of
glory.</hi> Our afflictions do it, not onely because
there is laid up a reward for the afflicted; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the measure of affliction; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
afflictions, and so every service of God,
doth make the heart more deep, more experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall,
more knowing, and profound; and
so more able to hold, contain, and bear more.
<hi>Every man shall receive his own reward, according
to his own labour.</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 17. Psal. 119. 71.
1 Cor. 3. 8. And this is the reason of such say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
as these; <hi>Lay up for your selves a good
foundation against the time to come, that you may
lay hold on eternall life:</hi> which eternall life, is
not the matter of our Justification from sin in
the sight of God; for that is done freely by
Grace, through Faith in Christs bloud; (but
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:102285:40"/>
here the Apostle speaks of giving of Alms) but
it is the same that in the other place he calls
the far more exceeding and eternall weight of
glory. And hence it is, that he in his stirring
them up to be diligent in good works, doth tell
them, that he doth not exhort them to it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he wanted, but because he would have
<hi>fruit that might abound to their acco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi>
as he saith also in another place, <hi>Belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Brethren, be stedfast, unmoveable, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
abounding in the work of the Lord;
for as much as ye know that your labour is
not in vain in the Lord.</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 18, 19.
Phil. 4. 16, 17. 1 Cor. 15. 58. Therefore I say,
the reward that the Saints shall have at this
day for all the good they have done, it is the
injoyment of God, according to their works:
though they shall be freely justified and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
without works.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As the injoyment of God at
that day, will be to the Saints, according to
their works and doings. (I speak not now of
Justification from sin) so will their prayse and
commendations at that day, be according to
the same, and both of them their degrees of
glory; for I say, as God by communicating
of himself unto us at that day, will thereby glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
us, so also he will for the adding all things
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:102285:40"/>
that may furnish with glory every way, cause
to be proclaimed in the face of Heaven, and
in the presence of all the holy Angels: every
thing that hath for God, his ways, and people,
been done by us while here we have been.
<hi>Whatsoever hath bin spoken in darkness,
shall be heard in the light: and that which
ye have spoken in the ear in Closets, shall
be proclaimed upon the House tops.</hi> Again,
he that shall confess me, saith Christ, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
men, him will I confess before the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now as he of whom Christ is ashamed
when he comes in his glory, and in the glory of
the holy Angels, will then lie under uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveable
disgrace, shame, dishonour, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt:
so he whom Christ shall confess, own,
commend, and prayse at that day, must needs
have very great Dignity, Honour, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown;
<hi>for then shall every man have prayse of
God,</hi> to wit, according to his works. <hi>Luke 12.
2, 3. Mark 8. 38. Mat. 10. 32. 1 Cor.</hi> 4, 5.
Now will Christ proclaim before thee, and all
others, what thou hast done, and what thou hast
suffered, what thou hast owned, and what thou
hast withstood for his name. This is he that
forsook his goods, his Relations, his Country,
and life for me: this is the man that overcame
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:102285:41"/>
the flatteries and threats, allurements and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticings
of a whole World for me; behold <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>,
he is an <hi>Israelite</hi> indeed, the top man in his
Generation, <hi>none like him in all the Earth.</hi> It is
said, that when King <hi>Ahasuerus,</hi> had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of how good service <hi>Mordeeai</hi> the
<hi>Jew</hi> had done to, and for him, he commanded
that the royall Apparel, and the Crown, with
the Horse that the King did ride on, should be
given to him, and that he should with that
Crown, Apparel, and Horse, be had through
the City, in the presence of all his Nobles, and
that Proclamation should be made before him:
<hi>thus shall it be done to the man whom the King
delighteth to honour. Esth.</hi> 6. 9, 10, 11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ahasuerus</hi> in this was a Type, to hold
forth to the Children of God, how kindly he
will take all their labour and service of love,
and how he will honour and dignifie the same,
as Christ saith, <hi>Let your loins be girded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
and your lights burning, and you your
selves like unto men that wait for their
Lord, when he will return from the Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding:
that when he cometh and knocketh,
ye may open to him immediately, blessed are
those servants, whom their Lord when he
cometh, shall find watching. Verily I say
unto you, that he shall gird himself, and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:102285:41"/>
shall make them sit down to meat, and shall
come forth and serve them.</hi> Luke 12.
35, 36, 37. The meaning is, that those souls
that shall make it their business to honour the
Lord Jesus Christ, in the day of their tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he will make it his business to honour and
glotifie them in the day of his glorification.
<hi>Verily, I say unto you, that he will make
them sit down to meat, and shall come forth
and serve them; if any man will serve
me,</hi> saith he, <hi>him will my Father honour.
Joh. 12. 26. Job 1. 8. Joh. 1. 47. Mark 14. 9.
Rev. 3, 4. Rev.</hi> 14. 12. 3, 4, 5. It hath bin Gods
way in this World, to proclaim the acts and
doing of his Saints in his Word, before all in
this World, and he will do it in that which is
to come.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Another thing that shall be yet
added to the glory of the Saints, in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of their Saviour, at his coming, is, they
shall every one of them then have his Throne
and place of degree on Christs right hand, and
on his left, in his glorious Kingdom, according
to the relation they stand in to Christ, as the
members of his Body; for as Christ will have
a special eye on us, and a tender and affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
heart, to recompence to the full every
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:102285:42"/>
good thing that any man doth for his name in
this World: so also he will have as great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
that there be to every member of his
body, the place, and state that is comely
for every such member. When the Mother of
<hi>Zebedees</hi> Children petitioned our Saviour, that
he would grant to her, that her two Sons might
fit the one on his right hand, and the other on
his left in his Kingdom: though he did not
grant to her the request for her Children, yet
he affirmed, that there would be places of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
and honour in Heaven, saying, <hi>To sit on
my right hand and on my left, is not mine to give,
but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of my Father.</hi> See <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 20, 21, 22, 23.
In the Temple, there were Chambers bigger,
and lesser, higher and lower, more inward and
more outward: which Chambers were types of
the Mansions that our Lord when he went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
told us he went to prepare for us. <hi>In my
Fathers House are many mansions, if it were not
so, I would have told you, I go to prepare a place
for you,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Joh</hi> 14. 1, 2, 3. The foot here, shall
not have the place prepared for the eye, nor
yet the hand, that which is prepared for the
ear; but every one shall have his own place
in the Body of Christ, and the glory also pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for such a relation: order, as it is comely
in Earth, so much more in the Kingdom of the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:102285:42"/>
God of Order, in Heaven; where all things
shall be done in their utmost perfections.
Here shall <hi>Euoch, Noah, Abraham, Moses,
Joshuah, David,</hi> with the <hi>Prophets,</hi> have every
one his place, according to the degree of old
Testament Saints. As God said to <hi>Daniel, Go
thy way till the end be; for thou shalt rest, and
stand in the lot at the end of the days.</hi> Dan. 12. 13.
And here also, shall <hi>Peter, Paul, Timothy,</hi> and
all other the Church-Officers have their place,
and Heavenly state, according as God hath set
them in the Church in the New Testament. As
<hi>Paul</hi> saith of the Deacons, <hi>They that use the
Office of a Deacon well, they purchase to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
a good degree, and great boldness in the
faith which is in Christ.</hi> 1 Tim. 3. 13. And so of
all other Saints, be they here of what Ranck,
Quality, or place in the Church soever, they
shall have every one his state, his Heavenly
State, according as he standeth in the Body.
As he saith, seeing those members that are
most feeble, are necessary, <hi>to them shall be given
more abundant honour.</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 22, 23. Of
this Heavenly Order in the Kingdom of <hi>Christ,</hi>
when his Saints are risen from the dead, was
<hi>Solomon</hi> a notable Type in his Family, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
his Servants and Officers, who kept such
exactness in the famous order, in which he had
placed all about him, that it did amaze and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:102285:43"/>
confound beholders. <hi>For when the Queen
of</hi> Sheba <hi>had seen the wisdom of</hi> Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
<hi>and the House which he built, and
the meat of his Table, the sitting of his
Servants, and the attendance of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
and their Apparel, his Cup-bearers
also, and their Apparel, and the ascent by
which he went up into the House of the
Lord: there was no more spirit in her.</hi>
2 Chron. 9. 3, 4. Glorious things are spoken of
thee, O thou City of God.</p>
               <p>Having gone thus far, I shall now come to
the second part of the Text, to wit, that there
shall be a Resurrection of the wicked. <hi>There
shall be a Resurrection of the dead, both of the
Just and unjust.</hi> For as the Just go before the
unjust, in Name and Dignity, and Honour, so
they shall in the last day, go before them in the
Resurrection.</p>
               <p>Now then, when the Saints have thus risen
out of their Graves, given up their accounts,
received their glory, and are set upon the
Thrones, (for there are set Thrones of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the Thrones of the House of <hi>David.)
Psal.</hi> 122. 5. When I say, they are all of them
in their royall Apparel, with Crowns of glory,
every one presenting the Person of a King:
then come the unjust out of their Graves,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:102285:43"/>
to receive their Judgment for what they have
done in the body. As <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>We must all
appear before the Judgment Seat of Christ, that
every one,</hi> (both Saints and sinner) <hi>may receive
the things done in the body, whether it be good, or
whether it be bad.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now because I would prove by the
words, whatever I would have others receive
for a truth: therefore I shall in few particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
prove the Resurrection of the wicked.</p>
               <p>First then, it is evident, that the wicked
shall rise from the very <hi>termes and names that
the raised shall then go under,</hi> which is the very
same names that they did go under when they
lived in this World. They are called the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
the Nations, the World, the wicked, and
those that do iniquity; they are called Men,
Women, <hi>Sodom, Sidon, Bethsaida, Capernaum,</hi>
and <hi>Tire. The Men of</hi> Ninive <hi>shall rise up
in Judgment, the Queen of the South shall
rise up in the Judgment, and it shall be
more tolerable for</hi> Sodom <hi>in the day of
Judgment, then for other sinners that have
resisted more light. The Heavens and the
Earth that now are, are kept in store, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
unto fire against the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and perdition of ungodly men.</hi>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:102285:44"/>
2 <hi>Pet. 3. 7. Mat. 12. 41, 42. Mat. 11. 21, 22,
23, 24. Luk. 10. 12, 13, 14. Joel 3. 12, 13, 14.
Mat. 25. 32. Jud.</hi> 14. 15. Now these Termes,
or Names, are not given to the spirits of the
wicked onely; but to them as consisting of
Body and Soul. Further, Christ tells his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries,
when they had apprehended him, and
shamefully intreated him, that <hi>yet they should
see him sit on the right hand of power, and
coming in the Clouds of Heaven,</hi> as <hi>John</hi>
also doth testifie, saying, <hi>Behold he
cometh with Clouds, and every Eye shall
see him, and they also that pierced him,
and all the kinreds of the Earth shall wail
because of him.</hi> Mat. 26. 64. Revel. 1. 7.
Now none of these sayings are yet fulfilled,
neither shall they, untill his second coming;
for though the <hi>Jews</hi> did many of them see him,
when he did hang upon the Cross, yet then he
was not coming in the Clouds of Heaven, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did then all kinreds of the Earth wail be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of him. No, this is reserved till he
comes to judge the World; for then shall the
ungodly be so put to it, that gladly they would
creep into the most invincible Rock or Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
under Heaven, to hide themselves from his
Face, and the Majesty of his Heavenly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.
<hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 14, 15, 16, 17. There shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:102285:44"/>
that this may be brought to passe, <hi>be a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
of the dead, both of the just, and unjust.</hi>
For though an opinion of no Resurrection may
now lull men asleep, in security and impiety,
yet the Lord, when he comes, will rouse them,
and cause them to awake; not onely out of
their security, but out of their Graves, to their
doom, that they may receive for their errour,
<hi>the recompence that is meet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The Body of the ungodly must,
at the last, arise out of the Grave, because <hi>that
Body and their Soul, while they lived in the World,
were Co-partners in their lusts and wickedness. God
is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are
weighed.</hi> 1 Sam. 2, 3. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 12. 14. He will
therefore bring every work into Judgement,
<hi>with every secret thing.</hi> And as he will bring into
Judgement every work, so will he also the
worker thereof, <hi>Revel. 20. 12, 13, 14. even
the Dead, small and great.</hi> It is not in God to
lay the punishment where the fault is not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to punish a part of the damned for the
whole. <hi>With righteousness shall be judge the
World, and the People with Equity, shall not the
Judge of all the Earth do right?</hi> Psal. 98. 9.
Gen. 18. 25. As therefore the Body was Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partner
with the Soul in sinning, so shall every
man receive the things done in his Body, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:102285:45"/>
to what he hath done. Wherefore he
saith in another place, <hi>Behold I come quickly,
and my Reward is with me, to give every man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as his work shall be,</hi> Rev. 22. 12. There
shall therefore be <hi>a Resurrection of the Dead,
both of the just, and unjust.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. The body of the wicked must rise again,
because as the whole man of the just also that is
the Vessel of mercy &amp; glory: so the whole man
of the unjust, is the Vessel of wrath and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.
There are, saith <hi>Paul,</hi> in a great
House, not onely. Vessels of Gold and of Silver,
but also of Wood and of Earth, and some to
Honour, and some to dishonour. Now as he
sheweth us these Vessels to honour, they are
good men, and the vessels to dishonour are the
bad. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 20, 21. Now as these vessels to
dishonour, are called the vessels of wrath: so
it is said, that God with much long suffering,
doth suffer them to be fitted to destruction.
<hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 22. how they are thus fitted, he also
further sheweth, where he saith, <hi>They do
after their hardness and impenitent heart, treasure
up wrath against the day of wrath, and the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the righteous Judgement of God.</hi> Rom.
2. 5. Which treasures of wickedness, <hi>James</hi>
saith, it is treasured up against the last dayes,
(which is the time of Judgement,) and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:102285:45"/>
it, <hi>He saith, that then it shall eat their flesh,
as it were fire.</hi> Jam. 5. 12. 3. Now then their
Bodies being the vessels of the wrath of God,
and again, seeing with this wrath they must be
possessed at the last day, that their flesh must
with it be eaten, it is evident, that their body
must rise again out of their Graves, and before
the Judgement Seat appear; for it is from
thence, that each of them must go with his full
load to their long and eternal home, <hi>where their
Worm dieth not, and their fire is not quenched.
Mark</hi> 9. 47, 48.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>The severity of the hand of God
towards his Children,</hi> with his forbearance of his
enemies, doth clearly bespeak a Resurrection
of the ungodly, that they may receive the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
for their wickedness which they have
committed in this World. We know, that
while the eyes of the wicked start out with fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
the godly are plagued all the day long,
and chastned every morning. <hi>Psal.</hi> 73. 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. Wherefore it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that the place and time of the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the ungodly, it is another World. <hi>If
Judgement begin at the House of God, what will
the end of them be, that obey not the Gospel of God?
and if the Righteous scarcely be saved, where
shall the ungodly and sinner appear? 1 Pet.</hi> 4.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:102285:46"/>
17, 18. Alas, poor Creatures! they now plot
against the Righteous, and gnash upon them
with their teeth; but the Lord laugheth at
them, <hi>for he seeth their day is coming;</hi> for as he
saith, <hi>the wicked is reserved,</hi> or let alone in
his wickedness, <hi>to the day of destruction, and
shall then be brought forth to the day of wrath,</hi>
Psal. 37. 12, 13. though in the mean time, he
may go to his Grave in his banner, and rest
within his Tomb. As <hi>Peter</hi> saith again,
Job 21. 29, 30, 31, 32. <hi>the Lord knoweth how
to deliver the godly out of temptation, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the unjust to the day of Judgement to be pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ished,</hi>
2 Pet. 2. 9. And <hi>Jude</hi> saith, <hi>for them is
reserved the blackness of darkness for ever.</hi> Jude
13. The punishment of the ungodly, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
till the day of Judgement, which will
be the time of their <hi>Resurrection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Observe, first, The wicked must be pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ished.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The time of their punishment,
is not now, but at the day of Judgement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, This day of Judgement, must be
the same with the</hi> Resurrection of the Dead, <hi>at
the end of this World. As</hi> therefore the Tares
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:102285:46"/>
are gathered and burned in the fire, so shall
it be in the end of this World. The Son of
Man shall send forth his Angels, and they
shall gather out of his Kingdom all things
that offend, and them that do iniquity, and
shall cast them into a Furnace of fire, there
shall be weeping, and gnashing of Teeth.
<hi>Mat. 13. 40, 41. There shall then be a</hi> Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of the Dead, both of the just, and unjust.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly, The</hi> Soveraignty of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
over all Creatures, <hi>doth plainly foreshew a</hi>
Resurrection <hi>of the bad, as well as of the good.
Indeed, the unjust shall not arise, by vertue of
any relation they stand in to the Lord Jesus, as
the Saints shall; but yet, because all are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
into his hand, and he made Soveraign
Lord over them: therefore, by an Act of his
Soveraign Power, they that are ungodly,
shall arise, this is Christs own Argument,</hi>
The Father judgeth no man, saith he, but
hath committed all Judgment unto the
Son, <hi>that is,</hi> Count him, and fall before
him as their Soveraign Lord, even as
they honour the Father, and he hath given
him authority, to execute Judgement also,
because he is the Son of Man. <hi>And then
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:102285:47"/>
he adds,</hi> Marvel not at this, for the hower
is coming, that all that are in their graves
shall hear his Voyce, and shall come forth,
they that have done good, to the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of life; and they that have done
evill, to the Resurrection of damnation.
<hi>Joh. 5. 22, 23, 27, 28, 29. From hence
also</hi> Paul <hi>argueth, saying,</hi> For this cause
he both dyed, rose, and revived, that he
might be Lord both of the dead and liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<hi>And then adds,</hi> We must all stand
before the Judgement Seat of Christ. <hi>Rom.</hi>
14. 9. 10.</p>
               <p>Pray mind these words, <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> by
his Death and Resurrection, did not onely pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
Grace, and Remission of sins, for his
Elect, with their Eternal Glory; but did
thereby also obtain of the Father, to be Lord,
and Head over all things, whether they be
things in Heaven, or things on Earth, or things
under the Earth, <hi>All Power,</hi> saith he, <hi>in
Heaven and in Earth, is given unto me, and I
have the Keys of Hell and of Death.</hi> Mat. 28. 18.
Rev, 1. 18. So that all things, I say, whether
they be visible, or invisible, whether they be
Thrones or Dominions, or Principalities or
Powers; all things were created by him, and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:102285:47"/>
for him. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 16. This being thus, <hi>at the
Name of Jesus, every knee must bow, and every
Tongue confess that he is Soveraign Lord, to the
glory of God the Father.</hi> Phil. 2. 9, 10, 11. Now
that this may be done, He hath
his Resolutions upon a Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-day,<note place="margin">See more of this in their Judgement.</note>
in which, he to shew
himself his People, his Way,
and Word in their Glory,
will have all his Enemies raised out of their
Graves, and brought before him, where he will
sit upon them in the Throne of his Glo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y, and
will shew them then, <hi>who is the onely Potentate,
the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</hi> Mat. 25.
31, 32. 1 Tim. 6. 14, 15.</p>
               <p>Beloved, He comes with ten thousand of
his Saints, to execute Judgement upon all, and
to convince all that are ungodly among them,
of all their ungodly deeds which they have
committed, and of all their wicked speeches
which ungodly sinners have spoken against
him. <hi>Jude</hi> 14, 15.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The great preparation that God
hath made for the Judgement of the wicked,
doth clearly demonstrate their rising forth out
of their Graves.</p>
               <p>First, He hath appointed the day of their
rising.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:102285:48"/>
Secondly, He hath appointed their Judge,
to judge them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, He hath Recorded all their acts
and doings against that day.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, He hath also, already appointed
the Witnesses to come in against them.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The Instruments of death and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery,
are already prepared for them.</p>
               <p>For the first, he hath appointed the day of
their rising, which day, <hi>John</hi> calleth the <hi>time</hi> of
the dead, that they should be judged. Which
time, <hi>Paul</hi> saith, is a time fixed; he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
a day, in which he will judge the
World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This <hi>time</hi> and <hi>day,</hi> Christ brings
down to an <hi>houre,</hi> saying, <hi>The hour is coming,
when all that are in their Graves, shall hear his
Voyce, and shall come forth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Revel. 11. 18.
Acts 17. 30, 31. Joh.</hi> 5. 28, 29.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As he hath appointed the day,
so he hath appointed the Judge, <hi>He hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
a day in which he will judge the World in
Righteousness, by that Man whom he hath ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
of which he hath given assurance to all men, in
that he hath raised him from the Dead.</hi> This Man
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:102285:48"/>
is <hi>Jesus Christ;</hi>for it is <hi>He</hi> that is ordained of
God, to be the <hi>Judge of the Quick and the
Dead.</hi> Acts 17. 30, 31. Acts 10. 40 41, 42.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, All their deeds and works, to
a word and thought, and every one already Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
and Inrolled in the Books of the Laws
of Heaven against that day.</hi> The sin of <hi>Judah,</hi>
is written with a pen of Iron, and with the point of a
Diamond, upon the Tables of their heart. <hi>And
again, saith God,</hi> Write it in a Table, and note
it in a Book, that it may be for the time to come,
even for ever and ever, that this is a rebellious
House, <hi>&amp;c. Jer. 17. 1. Isa.</hi> 30. 8, 9.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, God hath prepared his Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
against this day, <hi>James 5. 1. Job 20. 27.
Mat. 24. 14. Rom. 2. 14, 15. Malac.</hi> 3. 5.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The Instruments of Death, and
Eternal misery, are all already prepared, <hi>He
hath prepared for them the Instruments of Death,
he hath ordained his Arrows against the face of
persecutors,</hi> Psal. 7. 11, 12, 13. Psal. 21. 12. <hi>Hell
is of old prepared, he hath made it deep and large,
the fire, the everlasting fire is also now of a long
time prepared;</hi> the heavy weights of Gods
Curse, are also ready, <hi>and their damnation now
of a long time slumbereth not.</hi> Isa. 30, 33. Mat.
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:102285:49"/>
25. 41. <hi>Deut. 29. 19, 30. 2 Pet.</hi> 2, 3. But now
I say, how rediculous a business would all this
be, if these things should be all prepared of
the onely wise God, and there should be none
to be judged; or if he that is ordained Judge,
should not either through want of power, or
will, Command these Rebels, and force them
before his Judgement-Seat. Glad indeed,
would the sinners be, if these things might be
true. Glad I say, at very heart, if they might
be in their secret places of darkness, and the
Grave for ever; but it must not be, the day of
their rising is set; the Judge is appointed, their
deeds are written; the deep Dungeon is with
open mouth, ever waiting for them; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
at the day appointed, neither Earth, nor
Death, nor Hell can hinder: <hi>There shall be a
Resurrection of the Dead, both of the just, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, Besides what hath been said, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but believe, there shall be a Resurrection of
the wicked at the last day, because of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
consequences, and errours that do most
naturally follow the denyal thereof.</p>
               <p>For first, He that taketh away the Doctrine
of the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of the wicked: he taketh
away one of the main Arguments that God
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:102285:49"/>
hath provided for to convince a sinner, of the
evill of his w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>yes; for how shall a sinner be
convinced of the evill of sin, if he be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of the certainty of eternall Judgement?
and how shall be he be convinced of eternall
Judgement, if you perswade him, that when he
is dead, he shall not at all arise? (especially
seeing the <hi>Resurrection of the Dead, and eternall
Judgement,</hi> must unavoidably be one the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner
of the other. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. It was <hi>Pauls</hi>
reasoning of <hi>Righteousness, Temperance, and
Judgement to come, that made</hi> Felix <hi>tremble.</hi>
'Tis this also he calleth the Argument of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
wherewith he perswaded men. This was
<hi>Solomons</hi> Argument, and <hi>Christs</hi> also, where he
saith, <hi>That every idle word that man shall speak
he shall give an account thereof, in the day of
Judgement.</hi> Acts 24, 25. 2 Cor. 5. 10, 11.
<hi>Eccles. 11. 9. Mat.</hi> 12. 36.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They that deny the <hi>Resurrection
of the wicked,</hi> they do both allow and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the chief Doctrine of the <hi>Ranters,</hi> with
most of the debauched persons in the World.
For the <hi>Ranters</hi> deny it both in principle and
practice, and the other in practice, at least.
Now to me it is very strange, that these men
above all other, should both know and live in
the Doctrines of the Kingdom of God: especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:102285:50"/>
seeing the denyal hereof is an evident
token of one appointed to wrath and destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 18. But to be plain, <hi>There shall
be a Resurrection of the Dead, both of the just,
and unjust:</hi> Wherefore, whatever others may
say, or profess, being beguiled by Satan, and
their own hearts, yet do thou <hi>fear him that can
destroy both Body and Soul in Hell.</hi> Matth. 10.
28.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There shall be a Resurrection of the Dead, both
of the just, and unjust.</hi> Rev. 20. 13. And the
Sea gave up the Dead that were in it, and
Death and Hell delivered up the Dead that
were in them.</p>
               <p>Having in the first place shewed you, that
the wicked must arise; I shall in the next place
shew you the manner of their rising. And ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
it, as the very Title of the <hi>just,</hi> and <hi>unjust,</hi>
are opposites, so they are in all other matters,
and in their <hi>Resurrections.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First then, as the just in their <hi>Resurrection</hi> do
come forth in incorruption: the unjust in their
Resurrection, shall come forth in their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions;
for though the ungodly at their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,
shall for ever after, be incapable of
having Body and Soul separate: or of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
annihilated into nothing, yet it shall be far
from them to rise in incorruption; for if they
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:102285:50"/>
arise in incorruption, they must arise to life,
and also must have the Conquest over sin and
death; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 54. But that they shall not;
for it is the Righteous onely, that put on incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
that are swallowed up of life. The
wickeds Resurrection, it is called the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of damnation. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 28. These in
their very Resurrection, shall be hurt of the
second Death. They shall arise in death, and
shall be under it, under the gnawings, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
of it, all the time of their Arraignment.
As it were, a living death shall feed upon
them, they shall never be spiritually alive, nor
yet absolutely dead; but much after that
manner, that natural death, and Hell, by reason
of guilt, doth feed on him, that is going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Judge, to receive his Condemnation
to the Gallows. You know, though a Felon
go forth of the Goal, when he is going to the
Bar for his Arraignment, yet he is not out of
prison, or out of his Irons for that; his Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
are still making a noise on his heels, and
the thoughts of what he is to hear by and by
from the Judge, is still frighting and afflicting
his heart, Death, like some evil Spirit of Ghost,
doth continually haunt him, and playeth the
Butcher continually in his Soul and Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
with frights and fears about the thoughts
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:102285:51"/>
of the sudden, and unsupportable after-clap,
by and by he is to meet withall.</p>
               <p>Thus I say, will the wicked come out of
their Graves, having yet the Chains of eternal
death hanging on them, and the talons of that
dreadful Ghost fastned in their Souls. So that
life will be far from them, even as far as Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
is from Hell. This morning to them, is
even as the shadow of death. <hi>They will then
be in the very terrours of the shadow of Death.</hi> Job
24. 17. As Christ saith, <hi>Their Worm never dies,
and their fire is never quenched.</hi> Mark 8. 43, 44.
From Death to Eternity, it never shall be
quenched, their bed is now among the flames;
and when they rise, they will rise in flames;
while they stand before the Judge, it will be in
flames, even in the flames of a guilty Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
they will in their coming before the
Judge, be within the very Jaws of death and
destruction. Thus I say, the ungodly shall be
far off from rising as the Saints; for they will
be even in the Region and shadow of Death.
The first moment of their rising, Death will be
ever over them, ever feeding on their Souls; and
ever presenting to their hearts, the heights, and
depths, of the misery that now must seize
them, and like a bottomless Gulf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> must swallow
them up. <hi>They shall come out of their holes, like
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:102285:51"/>
worms of the Earth, and be afraid of the Lord our
God. Micah</hi> 7. 17.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of the godly,
shall be a <hi>Resurrection</hi> in Glory: So the <hi>Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi>
of the wicked, it will be a <hi>Resurrection</hi>
in dishonour. Yea, as the glory of Saints,
at the day of their rising, will be glory un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable:
so the dishonour of the ungodly at
that day, it will be dishonour beyond expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
As <hi>Daniel</hi> saith, <hi>The good shall, arise to
everlasting life; but the wicked to shame, and
everlasting contempt.</hi> Dan. 12. 2. And again,
<hi>When thou, O God, awakest, that is, to</hi> judge
them, <hi>Thou shalt despise their Image.</hi> Psal. 73.
20. Never was Toad or Serpent more loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
to any, then these will be in the eyes of
God, in their rising forth of their Graves. When
they go to their Graves, saith <hi>Job, their bones
are full of the sin of their youth, which lyeth down
in the dust with them. Job</hi> 20. 11. And a rise they
shall, in the same noisom and stinking condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
foras Death leaves, so Judgment finds
them. At the <hi>Resurrection</hi> then of these ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
they will be in a very loathsom condition.</p>
               <p>The ungodly at their death, are like the
Thistle-seed; but at their rising, they will be
like the Thistle grown; more noysom, offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive,
and provoking to rejection abundance.
Then such dishonour, shame and contempt,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:102285:52"/>
will appear in them: that neither God nor
Christ, Saints nor Angels, will so much as once
regard them, or vouchsafe one to come near
them. <hi>He beholdeth the wicked a far off;</hi> because
in the day of Grace, they would not come to
hand, and be saved, therefore now they shall,
all <hi>as thorns, be thrust away, as with fences of Iron.</hi>
2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 6, 7. Their rising, is called the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection</hi>
of the unjust, and so they at that day
will appear, and will more stink in the nostrils
of God, and all the Heavenly Hosts: then if
they had the most irksome Plague-soars in the
World running on them. If a man at his
Birth, be counted as one cast forth to the loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his person: how loathsom, and irksom,
dishonourable, and contemptible, will those be
that shall arise Godless, Christless, Spiritless,
and Graceless, when the Trumpet sounds to
their Judgement, they coming out of their
Graves, far more loathsom, and filthy, then if
they should ascend out of the most filthy hole
on Earth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, As the Just shall arise in power,
so the wicked and unjust, in weakness and asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.
Sin and guilt bringeth weakness,
and faintness in this life: how much more,
when both with all their power and force, like
a Gyant, fasten on them, as God saith, <hi>Can thy
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:102285:52"/>
hands be strong, and can thy heart indure in the
day that I shall deal with thee?</hi> Eccless. 22. 14.
Now will the gastly Jaws of despair gape upon
thee, and now will condemnings of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
like Thunder-claps, continually batter
against thy weary Spirit. It is the Godly that
have boldness in the day of Judgement; but
the wicked will be like the Chaffe which the
Wind driveth away. 1 <hi>John 4. 17. Psal.</hi> 1. 4.
O the fear, and the heart-aking that will seiz
them in their rising! the frightful thoughts
that then will fill their throbbing hearts! Now
must that Soul that hath been in Hell-fire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Devils, possess the body again. Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess
it I say, with the hot scalding stink of Hell
upon it. They shall not be able to lift up the
head for ever, pangs shall take hold on them,
all their hands shall faint, and every mans heart
shall melt, <hi>They shall be amazed one at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
their faces shall be as flames.</hi> Isa. 13. 6, 7, 8.
Every thing they see, hear, or think of, shall
tend to their discomfort. They must needs be
weak, whom God hath left, whom guilt hath
seized, and whom death is swallowing up for
ever.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, As the Just shall arise spiritual
Bodies, so the unjust shall arise onely as meer
and naked lumps of sinful nature: not having
the least help from God, to bear them up under
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:102285:53"/>
this condition. Wherefore, so soon as ever
they are risen out of their Graves: they will
feel a continual sinking under every remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of every sin, and thoughts of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in their rising they fall, fall I say from
thenceforth, and for ever. And for this Reason,
the Dungeon into which they fall, is called
<hi>bottomless, Rev.</hi> 20. 1. Because, as there will be
no end of their misery, so there will be no stay
or prop, to bare them up in it. Onely, as I said
before, they shall not now, as afore, be sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Body from Soul; but both together, be
bound in the cords of sin and iniquity, in
which they shall now tremble as Theeves and
Murderers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as they go before the Judge,
to hear what he will say unto them.</p>
               <p>Now when the wicked are thus raised out
of their Graves, they shall, together with all
the Angels of darkness, their fellow Prisoners;
be brought up, being shackled in their sins, to
the place of Judgement; where there shall fit
upon them <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> the King of Kings, and
Lord of Lords, the Lord chief Judge of things
in Heaven, and things in Earth, and things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Earth. On whose right hand, and
left, shall fit all the Princes, and Heavenly
Nobles; the Saints and Prophets, the Apostles,
and Witnesses of Jesus: every one in his
Kingly Attire, upon the Throne of his Glory.
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:102285:53"/>
                  <hi>Joel</hi> 3. 11, 12, 13, 14. Then shall be fulfilled
that which is written, <hi>As for these my enemies,
that would not that I should reign over them, bring
them before me to slay them.</hi> Luk. 19. 27.</p>
               <p>When every one is thus set in his proper
place, the Judge on his Throne, with his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants,
and the prisoners coming up to
Judgement: forthwith there shall issue forth
a mighty fire and tempest from before the
Throne, which shall compass it round about.
Which fire, shall be as Bars and bounds to the
wicked, to keep them at a certain distance
from the Heavenly Majesty. As <hi>David</hi> saith,
Psal. 50. 3. <hi>Our God will come, and not
keep silence, a fire shall devour before him,
and it shall be very tempestuous round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him.</hi> And again, <hi>Dan. 7. 9. His
Throne was like the fiery flame, and his
Wheels like burning fire. A fiery stream
issued, and came forth from before him,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This Preparation being made, to wit, the
Judge with his Attendance on the Throne; the
Bar for the Prisoners, and the Rebels all stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with gastly Jaws, to look for what comes
after: Presently the Books are brought forth,
to wit, the Books both of Death and Life. And
every one of them opened before the sinners,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:102285:54"/>
                     <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:102285:55"/>
now to be judged and condemned. For after
that he had said before,</hi> Dan. 7. 10.
A fiery stream issued, and came <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>orth from
before him: he adds, thousands, thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
ministred to him, and ten thousand
times ten thousand stood before him: the
Judgement was set, and the Books was open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<hi>And again,</hi> I saw a great white
Throne, and him that sate upon it, from
whose face, the Earth and the Heaven fled
away, and there was found no more place
for them; and I saw the dead, small and
great, stand before God, and the Books were
opened: and another Book were opened,
which is the Book of Life. And the Dead
were Judged out of the things that were
written in the Books, according to their
works. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 11, 12.</p>
               <p>He doth not say, the <hi>Book</hi> was opened, as of
one, but the <hi>Books,</hi> as of many. And indeed,
they are more than one, two, or three, out of
which the Dead shall in the Judgement, be
proceeded against.</p>
               <p>First then, there is the Book of the <hi>Creatures</hi>
to be opened.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Book of Gods <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:102285:55"/>
Thirdly, The Book of the <hi>Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And fourthly, The Book of <hi>Life.</hi> For by
every one of these, that is, out of what is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in them, shall the World of the ungodly be
judged.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>And the Books were opened.</head>
                  <p>First, The Book of the <hi>Creatures</hi> shall be
opened, and that first it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
mans nature,<note place="margin">The first Book opened in its first part.</note> and next,
as it relates to all other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
First, he will shew in
what the principles if nature
were, as they were Gods Creation; and how
contrary to these principles, the World have
walked, acted, and done. The principles of
nature are concluded under these three gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
heads.</p>
                  <p>First, That man by his own natural Reason
and Judgement, may gather, that there is a
God, a Deity, a chief, or first, or principal
Being, who is over all, and supreme above all.
This instinct, I say, man meerly as he is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Creature, findeth in himself; and hence
it is, that all Heathens that mind their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Reason, do conclude, that we are his off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring;
that is, his Creation and Worman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
That he made Heaven and Earth, and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:102285:56"/>
hath made of one blood, all Nations of men;
<hi>That in him we live, and move, and have our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28.</p>
                  <p>It appears further, that man by his own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
doth know that there is such a God.</p>
                  <p>1. By his being able to judge by nature, that
there is such a thing as sin, as Christ saith,
<hi>Why do ye not even of your selves, judge that which
is right,</hi> as if he had said, you are degenerated
even from the principles of nature, and right
reason; as <hi>Paul</hi> saith in another place, <hi>Doth
not even nature it self teach you,</hi> Luke 12. 57.
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 14. Now he that can judge, that
there is such a thing as sin, it must of necessity
be, that he understandeth that there is a God,
to whom sin is opposite; for if there be no
God, there is no sin against him, and he that
knowes not the one, knowes not the other.</p>
                  <p>2. It is evident further, that man by nature,
knowes that there is a God, by those fits of
fear, and dread that is often begotten in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
even in every man that breatheth in
this World; for they are by their own Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
and thoughts, convicted and reproved,
judged and condemned,<note place="margin">Mans nature is a Book, or law to it self.</note> though
they know neither <hi>Moses,</hi> nor
<hi>Christ. For the Gentiles which
have not the Law, these are a
Law to themselves, and shew the works of the Law,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:102285:56"/>
written in their hearts.</hi> Rom. 2. 14, 15. that is,
by this very thing, they hold forth to all men,
that God created them in that state and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
that they might, in, and by their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
judge, and know, that there is a God. And
it further sheweth it self, saith he, by those
workings of heart, convictions of Conscience,
and accusations, that every thought maketh
within them, together with the fear that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
in them, when they transgress, or do
those things that are irrational, or contrary to
what they see they shall do. I might add fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that the natural proneness that is in all
men, to <hi>Devotion and Religion,</hi> that is, of one
kind or another, doth clearly tell us, that they
by the Book of nature, which Book is them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
do read, that there is one great and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The second principle of nature
is, that this God should by man be sought af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that they might injoy Communion with
him for ever. As I said before, the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
sheweth man, that there is a great God,
even God that made the World; and the end
of its shewing him this is, that they might
<hi>seek the Lord, if happily they may feel after him,
and find him, though he be not far from every one
of them,</hi> &amp;c. Acts 17. 26, 27.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="106" facs="tcp:102285:57"/>
Thirdly, This light of nature teache<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>, that
men between themselves, should do that which
is just and equall. As <hi>Moses</hi> said, and that
long before the Law was given, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 26.
<hi>Exod. 2. 13. Sirs, ye are Brethren, why do ye
wrong one another?</hi> as who should say, you are
of equall Creation, you are the same flesh; you
<hi>both</hi> judge, that it is not equally done of any,
to do you wrong, and therefore ought to judge
by the same Reason, that ye ought not to wrong
one another.</p>
                  <p>Now against every one of these three prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
hath every man in the whole World
transgressed, as <hi>Paul</hi> saith; <hi>For both Jews and
Gentiles, are all under sin.</hi> Rom. 3. 9. For as
touching the first, who is he that hath honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
reverenced, worshipped, and adored the
living God, to the heighth, both of what they
saw in him, and also according to the goodness
and mercy they have as men, received from
him. Rom. 1. 25. <hi>All have served, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped
the Creature, more then the Creator, who
is blessed for ever and so have walkt contrary to,
and have sinned against this bond of nature, in
this first principle of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Men instead of minding their
own future happiness, as nature teacheth, they
have, through their giving way to sin and Satan,
minded nothing less; for though Reason teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:102285:57"/>
all men to love that which is good and
profitable, yet they contrary to this, have loved
that which is hurtfull, and destructive. Yea,
though sense teacheth, to avoid the danger that
is manifest: yet man, contrary to Reason and
sense both, even all men, have both against
light and feeling, rejected their own happiness,
as <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Though they kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>w the Judgements
of God, that they which do such things, are worthy
of death: not onely do the same, but take pleasure
in them that do them.</hi> Rom. 1. 33.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Man instead of doing equity, and
as he would be done by, which nature it self
teacheth: he hath given up himself to vile
affections, being filled, by refusing the
dictates of nature, with all unrighteousness, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,
wickedness, covetousness, malicious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity,
whispering, backbiting: to hate God, to be
dispiteful, proud, bosters, inventors of evill
things, disobedient to Parents, without under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
Covenant-breakers, without naturall
affections, implacable, unmerciful. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 28,
29, 30, 31, 32.</p>
                  <p>And observe it, he doth not say, that all
these things are by every man, put into pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice;
but every man hath all these in his heart,
which there defile the Soul, and make it abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:102285:58"/>
in the sight of God. They are <hi>filled
with all unrighteousness,</hi> which also appears, as
occasion serveth, sometimes one of them, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
more. Now man having sinned against
that natural Light, Judgement, Reason, and
Conscience, that God hath given him: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
though as I said before, he neither knew
<hi>Moses</hi> nor <hi>Christ,</hi> yet he shall perish; <hi>As
many,</hi> saith Paul, <hi>as have sinned without Law,
they shall perish without Law.</hi> Rom. 2. 12.</p>
                  <p>Yea, here will man be found, not onely a
<hi>sinner</hi> against God, but an (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 12. 25.) <hi>oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser</hi>
of himself, a contradictor of his own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and one that will not do that which he
judgeth even of <hi>himself</hi> to be right. Their sin
is written upon the Tables of their own heart,
<hi>and their own wickedness and back-sliding, shall
both correct, and reprove them.</hi> Jer. 17. 1. Jer.
2. 19.</p>
                  <p>It is marvellous, (if we consider) how curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
a Creature man was made of God: to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
how much below, besides and against that
state and place, man acts and does in this state
of sin and degeneracy. <hi>Man in his Creation,
was made in the Image of God,</hi> Gen. 1. 26. but
man, by reason of his yielding to the tempter,
hath made himself the very figure and Image
of the Devil. Man by Creation was made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
and sinless; but man by sin, hath made
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:102285:58"/>
himself crooked and sinful. <hi>Eccless.</hi> 7. 29. Man
by Creation, had all the faculties of his Soul
at liberty to study God, his Creator, and his
glorious Attributes and Being; but man by sin,
hath so bound up his own senses and reason,
and hath given way for blindness and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of God, so to reign in his Soul, that
now he is Captivated, and held bound in alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
and estrangedness, both from God, and
all things truly spiritually good; <hi>Because,</hi>
saith he, <hi>That when they knew God, they
glorified him not as God, but became vain
in their imaginations, and their foolish
he arts were darkened.</hi> And again, <hi>having
the understanding darkened, being aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the life of God, through the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
that is in them, through the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their hearts.</hi> Rom. 1. 21. Ephef.
4. 18.</p>
                  <p>Now for this abuse of the Workmanship of
God, shall man be brought forth to the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
shall be convicted, cast, and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as a Rebel, against both God, and his own
Soul, as <hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth, and that when he rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
but as a man. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 5, 6.</p>
                  <p>When this part of the Book touching mans
nature, is opened, and man convicted and caft
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:102285:59"/>
by it, by reason of his sinning against the three
general principles thereof: then forthwith is
the second part of the Book opened, <hi>which is
the mystery of the Creatures;</hi> for the whole Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
that is before thee, are not onely made to
shew the power of God in themselves; but
also to teach thee, and to preach unto thee,
both much of God and thy self; as also the
Righteousness, and Justice of God against sin;
<hi>For the wrath of God is revealed from
Heaven, against all ungodliness, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness
of men, who hold the truth in
unrighteousness; because that which may
be known of God, is manifest in them; for
God hath shewed it unto them; for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible
things of him, from the Creation of
the World, are clearly seen, being under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
by the things that are made, even his
Eternall Power, and God-head: so that
they are left without excuse.</hi> Rom. 1. 18.
19, 20.</p>
                  <p>The Creation then of the World, namely,
of the <hi>Heavens, Earth, Sun, Moon, Stars,</hi> with
all other the Creatures of God: they preach
aloud to all men, the Eternal Power and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
of their Creator. <hi>Psal. 8. 3. In Wisdom he
hath made them all:</hi> to be teachable, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:102285:59"/>
instruction in them: and he that is wise.
and will understand these things, <hi>even he shall
understand the loving kindness of the Lord; for
the Works of the Lord are great, and sought out of
all them that have pleasure therein.</hi> Psal. 104. 24.
Psal. 107. Psal. 111. 2.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As the Creation in generall,
preacheth to every man something of God: so
they do hold forth, how man should behave
himself both to God, and one to another; and
will assuredly come in, in the Judgement,
against all those that shall be found crossers, and
to thwarters of what God by the Creatures doth
hold fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>th to us.</p>
                  <p>As first, The obedience of the Creatures,
both to God and thee; first to God, they are
all in subjection (set Devils and men aside)
even the very Dragons, and all Deeps, Fire,
Hail, Snow, and Vapours, fulfilling his Word.
Yea, the Winds and Seas obey him. <hi>Psal.</hi> 148.
7, 8. <hi>Psal. 147. 15, 16, 17, 18. Mark</hi> 4. 41. Thus
I say, by their obedience to God, they teach
the obedience, and by their obedience, shall
thy disobedience be condemned, in the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>2. Their obedience to thee also, teacheth
thee obedience to all Superiours; <hi>For every kind
of Beasts, and of Birds, and Serpents, and things
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:102285:60"/>
in the Sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed, and
brought into obedience by mankind.</hi> Man onely
remains untamed, and untruly, and therefore by
these are condemned. <hi>Jam.</hi> 3. 7, 8.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The fruitfulness of all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
in their kind, doth teach and admonish
thee to a fruitful life to Godward, and in the
things of his holy Word. God did but say in
the beginning, <hi>Let the Earth bring forth fruit,
Grass, Herbs, Trees, Beasts, creeping things, and
Cattell after their kind; and it was so.</hi> Gen. 115.
24. But to man, he hath sent his Prophets, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
early, and sending them, saying, <hi>O do not this
abominable thing that I hate;</hi> but they will not
obey. <hi>Jer.</hi> 44. 4, 5. For if the Gentiles which
have not the Law, do by some acts of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
condemn the wickedness of those who do
by the Letter and Circumcision, break the Law:
how much more shall the fruitfulness of all the
Creatures come in, in the Judgement, against
the whole World. As <hi>Job</hi> saith, <hi>By the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and fruitfulness of the Creatures he judgeth,</hi>
(and so will judge) the people. <hi>Job</hi> 36. 27, 28,
29, 30, 31.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The knowledge and wisdom of
the Creatures, do with a check, command thee
to be wise, and do teach thee wisdom.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="113" facs="tcp:102285:60"/>
1. The Stork in the Heaven, the <hi>Swallow</hi> and
the <hi>Crane,</hi> by observing the time and season of
their coming, do admonish thee to learn the
time of grace, and of the mercy of God. <hi>Jer.</hi>
8, 7.</p>
                  <p>2. The <hi>Ox</hi> and the <hi>Ass,</hi> by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
they have of their Masters Crib, do
admonish thee to know the Bread and Table
of God, and both do and shall condemn thy ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
of the food of Heaven. <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. 3.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The labour and coyl of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
doth convict thee of sloath and idleness.
<hi>Go to the Ant thou sluggard, consider her wayes,
and be wise; for she provideth her food in the
Summer, and layeth up against the day of tryall.</hi>
Prov. 6. 6, 7. But thou spendest the whole Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
of thy life, in wasting both time and Soul.
<hi>All things are full of labour,</hi> saith <hi>Solomon,</hi> onely
man spendeth <hi>all the day idle, and his years like
a tale that is told.</hi> Eccles. 1. 8. Mat. 20. 6. Psal.
90. 9. Rom. 10. 21. The <hi>Cony</hi> is but a feeble
folk, yet laboureth for a House in the Rock, to
be safe from the rage of the Hunter. The <hi>Spider</hi>
also, taketh hold with her hands, and is in
Kings Palaces. 'Tis man onely, that turneth
himself upon the bed of sloath, as the door doth

will neither lay hold on the Rock Christ, as the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:102285:61"/>
                     <hi>Coney</hi> doth teach, nor lay hold on the Kingdom
of Heaven, as the <hi>Spider</hi> doth bid him. <hi>Prov.</hi>
30. 26. 28. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 40.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, The fear that is in all Creatures,
when they perceive that danger is near, it
teacheth men to fly from the wrath to come,
<hi>in vain is the snare laid in the sight of any Bird;
Prov.</hi> 1. 17 18. but man, man onely is the <hi>fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hardy
Creature,</hi> that layeth wait for his own
blood, and that lurketh privily for his own life.
How I say, will every Creature flie, run, strive,
and struggle, to escape the danger it is sensible
of? 'tis man onely, that delighteth to dance
about the mouth of Hell, and to be knowingly
smitted with Satans snare. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 33.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, The dependence that all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
have upon God: they teach thee to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
on him that made thee; yea, and will in
the Judgement condemn thee for thy unlawful
practices, and dealings for thy preservation.
<hi>The young Ravens seek their food from God,</hi>
and will condemn thy lying, cheating over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaching,
defrauding, and the like: they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
neither Store-house, nor Barn; but th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

art so greedy of these things, that thou for them
shuttest thy self out of the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:102285:61"/>
                     <hi>Psal. 147. 9. Job 38. 41. Luk. 12. 24.
Prov.</hi> 17. 16.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, The love and pitty that is in
their hearts to their young, and one another:
will judge and condemn the hard-heartedness
that is in thee to thy own Soul. What shall I
say, <hi>The Heavens shall reveal thy iniquity, and
the Earth shall rise up against thee.</hi> Job 20. 27.
That is, all the Creatures of God, they will by
their fruitfulness and subjection to the will of
their Creator, judge and condemn thee for thy
disobedience, and rebellion against him.</p>
                  <p>Now as these Creatures do every day call
unto thee, and lay before thee these things: so
he hath for thy awakening, in case thou be
asleep, and senseless, Creatures of another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as</p>
                  <p>1. Thy Bed when thou lyest down in it,
preacheth to thee thy Grave; thy sleep, thy
death, and thy rising in the morning, thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
to Judgement. <hi>Job 14. 12. Job 17.
13. Isa.</hi> 26. 19.</p>
                  <p>2. The Goal that thou seest with thy eyes,
and the Felons that look out at the Grate, they
put thee in mind of the Prison of Hell, and of
the dreadful state of those that are there. <hi>Luke</hi>
12. 58, 59.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="116" facs="tcp:102285:62"/>
3. The fire that burns in thy Chimney, it
holds forth the fire to Hell unto thee. <hi>Isa. 10.
16. Rev.</hi> 20. 14.</p>
                  <p>4. The ugly smell, stench, and steam, of the
burning Brimstone, it shews thee the loathsom,
odious, and dreadful torments of Hell. <hi>Rev.</hi>
19, 20.</p>
                  <p>5. The darkness of the night in solitary pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and the fears that do commonly haunt
those that walk therein: it preacheth to thee
the fears and frights, the scares and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that will for ever attend all damned
Souls. <hi>Matth. 8. 12. Deut.</hi> 28. 65, 66, 6. 7.</p>
                  <p>6. By thy delighting, when thou art cold,
to lay sticks on the fire to warm thy self, not
caring how fiercely they flame therein, so thou
canst be warm, and be refreshed thereby: by
this I say, God preacheth to thee, with what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
he will burn sinners in the flames of Hell,
for the easing of his mind, and the satisfaction
of his Justice. <hi>Ah!</hi> saith he, <hi>I will ease me of
my adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies.</hi>
Isa. 1. 24.</p>
                  <p>7. Yea, by thy blowing the fire, that it may
fasten upon the wood the better: thou preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:102285:62"/>
to thy self, how God will blow the fire
of Hell by the rigour of his Law, to the end, it
may be its flames, to purpose, kindle upon
damned sinners. <hi>Isa.</hi> 3. 33.</p>
                  <p>All these things, as inconsiderable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
as they may appear to you now, yet
in the Judgement will be found the Items, and
warning words of God to your Souls. And
know, that he who could overthrow the Land
of <hi>Egypt,</hi> with frogs, lice, flies, Locusts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
will overthrow the World, at the last day, by
the Book of the Creatures; and that by the
least, and most inconsiderable of them, as well
as by the rest. This Book of the Creatures, it
is so excellent, and so full, so easie, and so suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the capacity of all, that there is not one
man in the World, but is catched, convicted,
and cast by it. This is the Book, that he who
knows no letters, may read in: yea, and that
he who neither saw New Testament, nor Old,
may know both much of God, and himself, by.
'Tis this Book, out of which generally, both
<hi>Job</hi> and his friends did so profoundly discourse
of the Judgements of God, and that out of
which God himself did so convincingly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
<hi>Job. Job</hi> was as perfect in this Book, as
we are, many of us in the Scriptures, yea, and
could see further by it, then many now a
dayes do see by the new Testament and old.
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:102285:63"/>
This is the Book out of which, both Christ, the
Prophets, and Apostles, do so frequently dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
by their Similitudes, Proverbs, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables:
as being the most easie way to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
the World, though by reason of their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
nothing will work with them, but
what is set on their heart by the holy Ghost.</p>
                  <p>One word further, and I have done with
this, and that is, God hath sealed the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the World by the Book of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
even by mans own carriage unto such of
them, which, through any impediment, have
disappointed his expectations. As thus, if thou
hast but a Tree in thy Orchard, that neither
beareth fruit, nor ought else that is good: why
thou art for hewing it down, and for appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, as fewel for the fire: now thou little
thinkest, that by thy thus judging, thou shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
passe sentence upon thy own fruitless
Soul; but it is so, <hi>For now is the Ax laid to
the Roots of the Trees, and every Tree that bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not forth good fruit, is hewen down, and cast
into the fire.</hi> For as truly as thou sayest of thy
fruitless Tree, cut it down, why doth it cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet
the ground? so truly doth thy Voyce cause
Heaven to Eccho again upon thy head: <hi>Cut
him down, why doth he cumber the ground?</hi> Mat.
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:102285:63"/>
3. 10. Luk. 13. 6, 7, 8. Ezek. 15. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8.</p>
                  <p>Further, The inclination of thy heart to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
fruitless and unprofitable Creatures, doth
fore-preach to thee, the inclination of the
heart of God towards thee in the Judgement:
If thou hast either Cow, or any other Beast,
that is now unprofitable to thee, though thou
mayst suffer them for some time, to be with
thee, as God suffereth sinners in the World,
yet all this while, thy heart is not with them;
but thou wilt take thy time to clear thy hands
of them. Why, just so shall thy Judgement
be, as God saith, <hi>Though</hi> Moses <hi>and</hi> Samuel
<hi>stood before me,</hi> that is, <hi>to pray me to spare this
People, yet my heart could not be towards them,
therefore cast them out of my sight, and let them
go forth.</hi> Jer. 15. 1. Ezek. 14. 13, 14.</p>
                  <p>Thus I say, will God judge the World at
the last day; he will open before them, how
they have degenerated and gone back from the
Principles of nature, in which he created them.
Also how they have slighted all the instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that he hath given them, even by the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
fruitfulness, wisdom, labour, fear, and
love of the Creatures; and he will tell them,
that as to their Judgement, they themselves
have decided it, both by their cutting down
that which was fruitless, and by the withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:102285:64"/>
of their hearts from those things, which to
them were unprofitable, <hi>As therefore the Tar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

are gathered, and burned in the fire, so shall it be
in the end of this World.</hi> As men deal with
weeds, and rotten Wood: so will God deal
with sinners in the day of Judgement: and
will bring in, I say, all the Counsels and warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
he hath given men by these things, both to
clear up, and to agravate their Judgement to
them.</p>
                  <p>The second Book that will be opened at this

Mal.</hi> 3. 16. For as God hath in his <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,</hi>
Recorded all and every particular good

so he hath in his <hi>Remembrance,</hi> Recorded all
the evill and sin of his adversaries;<note place="margin">The Book of Gods Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance opened.</note> 
                     <hi>even every
thing. Eccles.</hi> 12. 14. Now <hi>Gods Remembrance</hi>
is so perfect every way, that it is impossible,
that any thing should be lost, that is committed
to it to be kept, and brought forth to the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at the time appointed; for as a thousand
years are but as yesterday, with his Eternity:
so the sins that have been committed thousands
of years since, they are all so firmly fixed in
the <hi>Remembrance</hi> of the Eternal God, that they
are always as fresh and clear in his sight, as if
they were but just now in committing. He call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:102285:64"/>
again the things that are past, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 3. 15.
<hi>and hath set our most securest things in the light of
his Countenance,</hi> Psal. 90. 8. As he also saith in
another place, <hi>Hell it self is naked before him,
and destruction hath no covering.</hi> Job 26. 6. That
is the most secret, cunning, and hidden contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
of the most subtle of the infernal spirits,
which yet are far more slethy, then men, to
hide their wickedness; yet, I say, all their
wayes, hearts, and most secret doings, are clear,
to the very bottom of them, in the Eyes of the
great God. <hi>All things are open and bare,
before the Eyes of him with whom we have
to do: who will bring to light, the hidden
things of darkness, and will make manifest
the Counsels of the heart.</hi> Heb. 4. 13.
1 Cor. 4, 5.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ye that say, the Lord shall not see, neither
shall the God of</hi> Jacob <hi>regard it. Understand,
O ye bruitish among the People, and ye
fools, when will ye be wise?</hi> He that planted
the Ear, shall not he hear? He that formed
the Eye, shall not he see? He that cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steneth
the Heathen, shall not he correct?
He that teacheth man knowledge, shall not
he know? <hi>Psal. 94. 7, 8, 9, 10. See also,</hi>
Hos. 7. 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8. 13. Can any hide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:102285:65"/>
in secret places, that I should not see
him? <hi>that is, when he is committing
wickedness,</hi> saith the Lord, Do not I fill
Heaven and Earth, saith the Lord? <hi>Jer.</hi>
23. 24.</p>
                  <p>Now to know and see things, it is the cause
among men, of their remembrance. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
God to shew us, that he will remember
all our sins, if we die out of Christ, he tells us,
that he knoweth, and seeth them all, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
must needs remember them; for as is his
sight and knowledge, so is his Remembrance
of all things.</p>
                  <p>When this Book of his Remembrance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is opened, as it shall be, in the Judgement:
then shall be brought forth of their hidden
holes, all things, whatsoever hath been done
since the World began, whether by Kingdoms
in general, or persons in particular. Now also
shall be brought forth to open view, all the
transactions of God and his Son, among the
Sons of men, and every thing shall be applyed
to every particular person, in equity and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
to whom they belong: the sins that thou
hast committed shall be thy own, and thou thy
self shall bear them. <hi>The Lord is a God of
knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="123" facs="tcp:102285:65"/>
It will be marvellous to behold, how by
thousands, and ten thousands, God will call
from their secret places, those sins, that one
would have thought, had been dead, and buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and forgotten; yea, how he will shew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Sun, such things, so base, and so hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid,
that one would think, it was not in the
hearts of any to commit; for all is Recorded
in the Book of <hi>Gods Remembrance.</hi> While men
are here, they have a thousand tricks to present
themselves one to another, far more fair, and
honest then they are, or ever were. As Christ
said to the <hi>Pharisees, Ye are they, who justifie
your selves before men, but God knoweth your
hearts,</hi> Luk. 16. 15. I, God knoweth indeed,
what a nest, what a heap, what swarms; yea,
what Legions of hellish wickednesses, there is
with power lurking, like <hi>Cockatrices,</hi> in those
men, that one would swear a thousand times,
are good and honest men. The way of men in
their sins, <hi>it is like an Eagle in the Air, a
Serpent upon the Rock, a Ship in the midst of the
Sea, and of a young Man with a Maid:</hi> saith
<hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 30. 19, 20. That is, hiddenly,
closely, covertly, burying all under fair pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
wipeth their mouths in the close of their
evill, saying, <hi>I have done wickedness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this, though it may serve for the time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
and no longer, God will not be deluded,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:102285:66"/>
nor blinded, nor mocked, nor put off.
<hi>Gal. 6. 7. They consider not that I remember
all their wickedness,</hi> saith he, <hi>but I will reprove
thee, and will set them in order before thine eyes.</hi>
Hos. 7. 2. Psal. 50. 21. Here will be laid open,
the very heart of <hi>Cain</hi> the murderer, of <hi>Judas</hi>
the Traytor, of <hi>Saul</hi> the adversary of <hi>David,</hi>
and of those that under pretences of holiness,
have persecuted Christ, his Word and People.
Now shall every Drunkard, Whoremaster,
Thief, and other wicked person, be turned, their
inside outward; their hearts right open, and
every sin, with every circumstance of place,
time, person with whom, with the causes also
that drew them to the commission of every
evill, be discovered to all. Here will be no hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
your selves behind Curtains, nor no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
your selves with the black and dark
night. If I say, surely the darkness shall cover
me, even the night shall be light about me; yea,
(O God) darkness hideth not from thee, but
the night shineth as the day, the darkness and
light are both alike unto thee. <hi>Psal.</hi> 139. 11,

                  <p>The piercing Eye of God, beholds all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:102285:66"/>
and convincingly, whatever hath pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
from them, or bin done by them in their
whole life; <hi>For, for all these things, God will
bring thee into Judgement.</hi> Eccles. 11. 9. Again,
as God will bring out of the Book of his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance,</hi>
what ever hath passed from thee,
against him: so also will he then bring forth
by the same Book, all things and carriages of
his towards thee.</p>
                  <p>Here will he bring to thy mind, every Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
thou hast heard, every Chapter thou hast
read; every conviction thou hast had on thy
Conscience: and every admonition that hath
been given thee in all thy life, when thou wast
in the Land of the Living.</p>
                  <p>Now will God lay open before thee, what
patience he extended to thee, how he let thee
l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ve one year, two years, ten, yea twenty and
twenty years, and all to try thee. Yea, now also
will he bring to thy view, how many times he
warned, rebuked, threatned, and chastised
thee for thy wickedness; how many awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Providences and Judgements he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
laid before thy face; yea, how many a
time, thou didst like <hi>Balaam,</hi> run upon the
point of the Sword of Justice, and how he
gave back, as being loath to kill thee. <hi>Numb.</hi>
22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32,
33.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="127" facs="tcp:102285:67"/>
Now also again, shall be brought before
thee and all men, how many struglings God
had with thy heart, on thy sick Bed, to do thee
good; yea, and at such times, how many
Vowes, Promises, Ingagements, and Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
thou madest before God, to turn, if he
would release thee from thy affliction, and
take off his Rod from thy back: <hi>Mar.</hi> 5. 1, 2,
3, 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5. and yet how thou didst like the man
possessed, break, and snap in twain all these
Chains of Iron, with which thou hadst bound
thy Soul; and that for a very lust and sin. Here
also, will be opened before thee, how often
thou hast sinned against thy light and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
how often thou hast laid violent hands
on thy own Conscience; how often thou hast
laboured to put out that light that hath stood in
thy way, to hinder thee from sinning against
thy Soul. Ah Lord, what a condition will the
Christless Soul be in at this day? How will
every one of these things afflict the damned
Soul? they will pierce like Arrows, and bite
like Serpents, and sting like an Adder. With
what shame, will that man stand before the
Judgement Seat of Christ, who must have all
things he hath done against God, to provoke
the Eyes of his Glory to jealousie: laid open
before the whole Host of the Heavenly train!
It would make a man blush, to have his Pockets
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:102285:67"/>
searched, for things that are stolen, in the midst
of a Market, especially, if he stand upon his
Reputation and Honour. But thou must have
thy heart searched, the bottom of thy heart
searched; and that, I say, before thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
whom thou hast wronged, and before the
Devills, whom thou hast served; yea, before
God, whom thou hast despised, and before the
Angels, those holy and delicate Creatures,
whose holy and chast Faces, will scarce forbear
blushing, while God is making thee Vomit up,
all thou hast swallowed; <hi>for God shall bring it
out of thy belly.</hi> Job. 20. 12, 13, 14, 15.</p>
                  <p>For as for God to forget iniquity, is one of
the chief heads of the Covenant of Grace, and
is an Argument of the highest nature, to beget,
and to continue Consolation in the godly: so
the remembrance of Iniquity, by the Lord, it
is one of the heaviest loads, and Judgements
that can befall any poor Creature. <hi>Lord,</hi> saith
the Prophet, <hi>remember not against us, former
iniquities.</hi> And again, <hi>if thou Lord, shouldest
mark iniquity, O Lord, who shall stand?</hi> Psal.
130. 3. And the Reason is, because, that which
the Lord forgetteth, is forgiven for ever; but
that which he remembreth, it is charged for
ever, and nothing can take it away. <hi>Heb. 8. 12.
Rom. 4. 6, 7, 8. Though thou wash thee with nitre,
and take thee much Soap, yet thine iniquity is
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:102285:68"/>
marked before me, saith the Lord God.</hi> Jer. 2,
22.</p>
                  <p>The third Book that will at this day be
opened, and out of which God will judge
the World: it is the Book of the Law, or ten
words given forth on the Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> But this
Book will more specially concern those that
have received it, or that have had knowledge
thereof. Every one shall not be judged by this
Book, as there delivered, though they shall be
judged by the works of it, which are written in
their hearts. <hi>Rom. 2. 14. As many as have sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
without Law, shall perish without Law, and
they that have sinned in the Law, shall be judged
by the Law.</hi> Rom. 2. 12. That is, the Heathens
that never knew the Law, as delivered on
<hi>Sinai,</hi> they shall be judged by the Law, as it
was written in mans heart in his Creation,
(which is comprised within the Book of the
Creatures;) but those that have knowledge of
the Law, as delivered on <hi>Sinai:</hi> they shall be
judged by the Law as there given.</p>
                  <p>Now then, this Book when it is opened, at
the day of Judgement, it will, to those to whom
it especially relates, be a most terrible Law, far
surpassing the two afore-mentioned. This Law,
as I may so say, it is the chief, and most pure
Resemblance of the Justice and holiness of the
Heavenly Majesty, and doth hold forth to all
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:102285:68"/>
men, the sharpness and keenness of his wrath'
above the other two that I have before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned.
I say, both because it hath been deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
more plain and open, both as to the duty
injoyned, and the sin prohibited; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
must of necessity, fall with the more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
upon the head of all that shall be found
within the compass of it. This Law, it hath in it
to be opened at this day, these two general
heads. First, A discovery of the evill of sin, that
is so, against plain light and truth.</p>
                  <p>And Secondly, A discovery of the vanity
of all things, that will at this day be brought
by sinners, for their help and plea at the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Alas, who can but imagine, that the
poor World, at the day of their Arraignment,
should muster up all that ever they can think
of, as Arguments to shelter them from the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of that fierce wrath, that then with sink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Souls, they will see prepared for them.</p>
                  <p>As to the first of these, the Apostle tells us,
that <hi>the Law was added, that the offence might
aboun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi> or be discovered what it is. As he
saith again, <hi>I had not known sin but by the Law.</hi>
Rom. 5. 20. Rom. 7. 7. Rom. 7. 13. Thus it
is in this life, and thus it will be in the day of
Judgement, that is, those that see sin, and that
in its abounding nature, and in its exceeding
sinfulness, they must see it by the Law, for that
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:102285:69"/>
is indeed, the <hi>Glass by which God discovereth sin.
Jam.</hi> 1. 22, 23, 24, 25. And the filthy spots of
leprosie, that is in the Soul. Now those that
have not the <hi>happiness</hi> to see their sin by the
Law in this life, while there is a Fountain of
Grace to wash in, and be clean: they must
have the <hi>misery</hi> to see it at the Judgement,
when nothing is left but misery, and pain, as
the punishment for the same. At which day,
those little Titles of this holy Law, that now
men so easily look over, and sin against with
ease, they will every one of them appear with
such dread, and with such flaming Justice
against every offence committed: that if
Heaven and Earth it self, should step in to
shelter the sinner from the Justice and wrath
due to sin, it would turn them up by the Roots.
<hi>It is easier for Heaven and Earth to passe away,
then for one tittle of the Law to fail.</hi> Luke 16. 17.
If there appeared such flames, such Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and Tempests, as there were at the giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Law: what flames and blackness
will there appear at the execution thereof; and
if at the giving of the Law, there appeared so
much Holiness and Justice, that it made all
<hi>Israel</hi> flie; yea, <hi>holy Moses exceedingly fear
and quake:</hi> what will become of these that
God shall judge by the rigour of this Law in
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:102285:69"/>
the day of Judgement? <hi>Exod. 19. 16. Heb.</hi> 11.
21.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>O what Thunderings and Lightnings, what
Earthquakes and Tempests, will there be in
every damned Soul, at the opening of this
Book? then indeed, will God visit them with</hi>
Thunder, and Earthquake, and great noyse:
with Storm and Tempest, and the flame of
a devouring fire. <hi>For</hi> behold, <hi>saith the
Prophet,</hi> the Lord will come with fire, and
with his Chariots, like a Whirl-wind, to
render his anger with fury; and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes
with flames of fire. <hi>Isa. 29. 6. Isa.</hi>
66. 15.</p>
                  <p>The Lord will come with fire, that is, in the
flaming heat of his Justice and Holiness against
sin, and sinners, to execute the rigour of his
threatnings upon their perishing Souls.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The second general Head, that
is contained in this Law, to be opened at this
day, is its exactness, and purity, and strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
as to all acts of good that any poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hath done in this life, whereby he in the
Judgement will think to shelter, or secure
himself from the wrath of God. This is the
Rule, and Line, and Plummet, whereby every
act of every man, shall be measured; and he
whose righteousness is not found every way an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:102285:70"/>
to this Law, which all will fall short
of, but they that have the Righteousness of God
by faith in <hi>Jesus Christ:</hi> he must perish, as he
saith, Rom. 3. 21. 22. <hi>Judgement also will I lay to
the line, and Righteousness will I lay to the Plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,
and the Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>l shall sweep away the refuge of
lies, and the water shall overflow the hiding places.</hi>
Isa. 28. 17, 18. That is, though men may now
shelter themselves under legall Repentance,
cold profession, good meaning, thinkings, and
doings: yet all these things must be measured,
and weighed in the ballance of Gods most righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
Law: and as I said, whatever in that day,
is not found the Righteousness of God, it will
be found a re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uge of lies, and will be drowned
by the over-flowing of the wrath of God, as
the waters of <hi>Noah</hi> over-flowed the World.
<hi>Mal.</hi> 4. 1. And hence it is, that all the ungodly
will at this day, be found as stubble, and
the Law as fire. As it saith, <hi>From his Right
hand went a fiery Law.</hi> And again, <hi>his lips are
full of indignation, and his tongue as a devouring
fire.</hi> Deut. 33, 2: Isa. 30. 27. For as fire, where

this day, shall be found under the transgressio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

merciless Conquerours, who leave not any
thing behind them, but swallow up all with
fire and sword. <hi>For by fire, and by his Sword,
will the Lord plead with all flesh, and the slain of
the Lord shall be many.</hi> Isa. 66. 16. There are
two things at the day of Judgement, will meet
in their height and utmost strength, and they
are <hi>sin</hi> and the <hi>Law;</hi> for the Judgement will
not be, till the iniquity of the World be full
ripe. <hi>Joel. 3. 13. Rev.</hi> 14. 15, 16, 17, 18,
19, 20.</p>
                  <p>Now then, when sin is come to its full, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
plaid all its pranks, and done all the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
it can against the Lord of Glory: then
God brings forth the Law, his holy and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
Law, one of which will now reign for
ever, that is, either the Law or sin: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
sin and sinners, they must tremble with all
that help, and hold them up; for God will
<hi>magnifie the Law, and make it honourable.</hi> Isa.
42. 21. That is, will give it the Victory over
the World for ever; for that is holy, just, and
good: they are unholy, unjust, and bad. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by this Law, <hi>will the Lord rain snares, fire
and Brimstone, and a horrible Tempest, this shall
be the potion of their Cup.</hi> Psal. 11. 5, 6. Let no
man say then, that because God is so famous
in his mercy and patience, in this day of his
Grace, that therefore he will not be fierce, and
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:102285:71"/>
dreadful in his Justice, in the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
for Judgement and Justice, is the last
thing that God intends to bring upon the stage,
which will then be to the full, as terrible, as
now his goodness and patience, and long suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
is admirable. Lord, who knoweth the
power of thine anger? even according to thy
fear, so is thy wrath. <hi>Psal.</hi> 90. 11.</p>
                  <p>You may see, if you will, a few of the sparks
of the Justice of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> against sin and sinners:
by his casting off Angels for sin, from Heaven
to Hell; by his drowning the old World; by
his burning of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and <hi>Gomorah,</hi> to ashes;
<hi>condemning them with an overthrow, making them
an example to those that after should live ungodly.</hi>
2 <hi>Pet. 2. 4, 5, 6. Jude</hi> 6. 7.</p>
                  <p>For whatsoever the Law saith, it saith it to
them that are under the Law, that every mouth
may be stopped, and all the World become
guilty before God. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 19.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moses</hi> seems to wonder, that the Children
of <hi>Israel</hi> could continue to live, when they did
but hear the Law delivered on the Mountain,
<hi>Did ever People,</hi> saith he, <hi>hear the Lord speak
out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast done, and
live.</hi> Deut. 4. 73. O that ye did but know the
Law, and the wonderous things that are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
therein, before the Lord cause that fearful
Voyce to be heard, <hi>Cursed is every one, that
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:102285:71"/>
continueth not in every thing that is written in the
Book of the Law to do them:</hi> which curse must
fall on all that walk not in all the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God, <hi>without iniquity,</hi> which none do,
I say, but they that walk in Christ, who hath
alone fulfilled them all. <hi>Gal. 3. 10. Ezek.</hi> 33. 15.
<hi>Col.</hi> 2. 10.</p>
                  <p>The Law is that which standeth at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
of the Paradice of God, as a flaming
Sword turning every way to keep out those
that are not righteous with the righteousness of
God; that have not skill to come to the throne
of Grace by that new and living way which he
hath consecrated for us through the veil; that
is to say, his flesh, <hi>Gen. 3. 24. Heb.</hi> 1. 19, 20.
for though this Law, I say, be taken away by
Christ Jesus, for all that truly and savingly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve;
yet it remains in full force and power
in every tittle of it, against every Soul of man,
that now shall be found in his Tabernacle;
that is, in himself, and out of the Lord Jesus,
<hi>Col. 2. 14. Rom. 3. 19. Job</hi> 18. 14. it lyeth,
I say, like a Lyon rampant at the gates of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and will roar upon every unconverted
soul, fiercely accusing every one, that now

all its most perfect and legal commands,
and that can live in the midst of devouring

fire, and there injoy God and solace himself;
he shall dwell on high and shall not be hurt by
this Law, <hi>His place of defence shall be the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions
of Rocks; bread shall be given him, and
his waters shall be sure; thine eyes shall behold
the King in his Beauty, they shall see the Land
that is very far off,</hi> Isa. 33. 14. 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 16, 17.
Blessed then is he whose Righteousness doth

there will without doubt, be sad throbbing

Conscience, it will cry, Amen, to every
word that the Great God doth speak against
thee. Conscience is a terrible accuser, it will
hold pace with the Witness of God, as to the
truth of Evidence, to a hairs bredth. The Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
of Conscience, it is of great Authority,
it commands guilt, and fastneth it on every
Soul which it accuseth. And hence it is said,
<hi>if our hearts or Conscience condemn us. 1 Joh.</hi> 3.
20. Conscience will thunder and lighten at
this day; even the Consciences of the most
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:102285:74"/>
pagan sinners in the World, will have suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
wherewith to accuse, to condemn, and to
make paleness appear in their faces, and break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in their loins, by reason of the force of its
conviction. O the mire and dirt, that a guilty
Conscience, when it is forced to speak, will
cast up, and throw out before the Judgment-Seat!
it must out, none can speak peace, nor
health, to that man upon whom God hath let
loose his own Conscience, <hi>Cain</hi> will now cry,
<hi>My punishment is greater then I can bear,</hi> Judas

when Conscience stirreth. Gen. 4. 13. Mat.</hi> 27.
3. <hi>Dan. 5. 6. Acts</hi> 24. 23. When Conscience is
once thorowly awakened, as it shall be before
the Judgment-Seat: God need say no more to
the sinner, then <hi>Solomon</hi> said to filthy <hi>Shimei,
Thou knowest all the wickedness that thy heart is
privy to.</hi> 1 King. 2. 44. As who should say,
thy Conscience knoweth, and can well inform
thee of all the evill, and sin that thou art guilty
of. To all which it answereth, even as face
answereth to face in a Glass; or as an Eccho
answereth the man that speaketh, as fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

as God chargeth Conscience will cry out,
guilty, guilty; Lord, guilty of all, of every
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:102285:74"/>
whit, I remember clearly all the Crimes thou
layest before me. Thus I say, will Conscience
be a witness against the Soul, in the day of
God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, As God and Conscience, will at
this day be most dreadful witnesses against the
sinful man at this day: so also will those seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
thoughts that have passed through mans
heart, be a witness also against him. As he
said before, <hi>their Conscience also bearing witness,
and their thoughts the mean while accusing, or else
excusing one another, in the day when God shall
judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Gospel.</hi> Rom. 2. 14, 15.</p>
                  <p>The thoughts come in as a witness for God
against the sinner, upon the account of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steddiness
and variety that was in them, both
touching God, and their own selves. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the man thinks there is no God, but that
every thing hath its rise of it self, or by chance,
or fortune, <hi>The fool hath said in his heart,
there is no God.</hi> Psal. 14. 1.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes again, they think there is a God;
but yet they think and imagine of him falsly,
<hi>Thou thoughtest that I was altogether such a one
as thy self,</hi> saith God, <hi>but I will reprove thee.</hi>
Psal. 50. 21.</p>
                  <p>Men think, that because they can sin with
delight: that therefore God can let them es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape

                     <pb n="142" facs="tcp:102285:76"/>
without punishment. Nay, oftentimes
they think, that God doth either quite forget
their wickedness, or else that he will be pleased
with such satisfaction as they are pleased to
give him, even a few howling prayers, fained
and hypocritical tears, and weepings, which
passe from them. <hi>Hos. 7. 14. Mal.</hi> 2. 13. More
for fear of the punishment of Hell-fire, then
because they have offended so holy, so just, and
so glorious a God; and so loving, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descending
a Jesus.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes again, they have had right
thoughts of something of God, but not of
him together: either thinking so of his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
as to drive them from him, and also cause
them to put him out of their mind: <hi>Job</hi> 21. 14.
or else so thinking of his mercy, as that they
quite forget his Holiness and Justice. Now
both these are but base thoughts of God, and
so erronious, and sinful thoughts.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes also, they have prety right
thoughts of God, both as to Justice and Mercy,
but then through the wretchedness of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfied
nature, they, against this light and
knowledge, do with shut eyes, and hardened
hearts, rush fiercely, knowingly, and willingly
again into their sins and wickedness. <hi>Heb. 6.
2, 3, 4. Heb. 10. 26. 2. Pet.</hi> 2. 20.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="143" facs="tcp:102285:76"/>
Secondly, As men have these various
thoughts of God, so also their thoughts are not
steddy about themselves.</p>
                  <p>1. Sometimes they think they are sinners,
and therefore they have need of mercy.</p>
                  <p>2. Sometimes again, they think they are
righteous, and so have not so much need; mark,
and yet both alike rotten, and base: because,
as the last is altogether senseless: so the first
is not at all savingly senseable, <hi>Mark 10. 17,
18, 19, 20, 21, 22. Luk.</hi> 18. 11, 12.</p>
                  <p>3. Sometime again, they think they are
Gods; that they shall never die, or that if
they do die, yet they shall never rise again; or
if they do rise again, yet they shall be saved,
though they have lived vilely, and in their sins
all the dayes of their life. <hi>Ezek. 28. 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6. 1 Cor. 15. 12. Deut.</hi> 29. 18. 12. 20. Now
I say, every one of these thoughts, with ten
thousand more of the like nature, will God
bring in against the Rebels in the Judgment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.
Which thoughts, shall every one of them
be brought forth in their distinct order. <hi>He
sheweth to man what is his thought.</hi> And again,
I know that thou canst do every thing, and
that no thought can be hid from thee. <hi>Amos</hi>
4. 13. <hi>Job.</hi> 42. 2. We read, that when the
strangers at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> did but hear the Apostle
speak to every one of them in their own Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:102285:77"/>
how it amazed and confounded them.
<hi>Acts</hi> 2. 6, 7, 8. But I say, how will they look,
and be amazed, when God shall evidently,
clearly, and fully speak out all their hearts,
and every thought they have had, before
them.</p>
                  <p>Now the reason and strength of this wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
will lie here, that God will by the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and crossness that their thoughts had one to
another, and by the contradiction that was in
them, prove them sinners and ungodly; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that I say, sometimes they thought there
was a God, sometimes again they thought,
there was none. Sometimes they thought, that
he was such a God, and sometimes again, they
thought of him quite contrary; Sometimes
they thought he was worth regarding, and
sometimes they thought he was not: As also
sometimes they thought he would be faithful,
both to mercy and Justice, and sinners; and
sometimes again, they thought he would
not.</p>
                  <p>What greater Argument now can there be,
to prove men, vanity, froth, a lie, sinners, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded
by the Devil, and such as had false ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
of God, his waye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, his Word, his
Justice, his Holiness, of themselves, their sins,
and every action?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="145" facs="tcp:102285:77"/>
Now they will indeed appear, a very lump
of confusion, a mass of sin, a bundle of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
of Atheism, of unbelief, and of all
things that should lay them obnoxious to the
Judgments of God. This will God, I say, by
mustering up the thoughts of man, and by
shewing of them, that every imagination and
thought of their heart was onely evill, and
that continually (by shewing of them what
staggering, drunken, wild, and uncomely
thoughts they have had, both of him, and of
themselves) convince them, cast them, and
condemn them for sinners, and transgressors
against the Book of Creatures, the Book of his
<hi>Remembrance,</hi> and the Book of the Law. By
the variety of their thoughts, they shall be
proved unstable, ignorant, wandring Stars,
Clouds carryed with a Tempest, without order
or guidance, and taken Captive of the Devil
at his will.</p>
                  <p>Now while the wicked are thus standing
upon their tryal, and lives before the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Seat,
and that in the view of Heaven and
Hell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they I say, hearing and seeing such dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
things, both written and witnessed against
every one of them; and that by such Books,
and such Witnesses, as do not onely talk, but
testifie, and that with the whole strength of
truth against them: they will then begin,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:102285:78"/>
though poorly, and without any advantage, to
plead for themselves, which plea will be to this
effect.</p>
                  <p>Lord, we did find in the Scriptures, that
thou didst send a Saviour into the World,
to deliver us from these
sins and miseries.<note place="margin">The sinners plea for himself at the Judgment-Seat.</note> We
heard this Saviour also
published, and openly
profered to such poor
sinners as we are. Lord, Lord, we also
made profession of this Saviour, and were
many of us frequenters of his holy Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
We have eat and drunk in thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
and thou hast taught in our streets,
Lord, we have also some of us, bin Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
our selves, we have prophecied in thy
Name, and in thy Name have we cast out
Devils, and done many wonderous works:
Nay Lord, we did herd among thy People,
we forsook the profain and wicked World;
and carryed our shining Lamps before us in
the face of all men: <hi>Lord, Lord, open
to us.</hi> Mat. 7. 21, 22, 23. Luk. 13. 24,
25, 26, 27. Mat. 25. 1, 2. 10, 11.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="147" facs="tcp:102285:78"/>
And all the while they are thus pleading, and
speaking for themselves: behold, how ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
they groan, how gastly they look, and
how now the brinish tears flow down like Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
from their eyes, ever re-doubling their
Petition, <hi>Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord:</hi> first think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this thing, and then of that, ever <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending,</hi>
seeking, and striving to enter in at this
strait Gate. As Christ saith, <hi>When once the
Masters of the House is risen up,</hi> that is, <hi>when
Christ hath laid aside his mediation for sinners,
and hath taken upon him onely to judge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn:
then will the wicked begin to stand without,
and to knock and contend, for a portion among them
that are the blessed.</hi> Ah how will their hearts
twitter, while they look upon the Kingdom of
Glory! and how will they ake and throb at
every view of Hell, their proper place! still
crying, O that we might inherit life, and O
that we might escape eternal death!</p>
                  <p>But now to take away al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But this Book of Life, it is not at this time
opened, because there are not any godly to be

Judgment is past, and over, before the wicked
rise. The Book of Life then, it is now opened
for further conviction of damned Reprobates,
that their mouths may be stoped for ever, as
touching all their cavils, contendings and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
against Gods proceeding in Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with them. For believe it, while God is

Rom.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4, 5, 6. Yet not by a hasty and
and angry casting them away, but by a legall
and convincing proceeding against them, and
overthrowing all their cavils, by his manifest
and invincible truth. Wherefore, to cut off
all that they can say, he will now open the
Book of Life before them, and will shew them
what is written therein, both as to Election,
Conversion, and a truly Gospel-Conversation.
And will convince them, that they neither are
of the number of his Elect, neither were they
ever regenerate, neither had they ever a truly

By these three things then, out of this Book,
thou, who art not saved, must at last be judged,
and overcome.</p>
                  <p>First, Here will be tryed, whether thou art
within that part of this Book, wherein all the
Elect are Recorded; for all the Elect are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
here, as Christ saith, <hi>Rejoyce, that your
names are written in Heaven;</hi> And again, <hi>in thy

written,</hi> Luk. 10. 20. <hi>Psal.</hi> 139. 16. Heb, 12.
22, 23.</p>
                  <p>Now then, if thy name be not found, either
among the Prophets, Apostles, or the rest of
Saints, thou must be put by, as one that is cast
away, as one polluted, and as an abominable

2. 62. Thou art not prickt for everlasting life,
therefore thou must not be delivered from that
Soul-amazing misery; for there are no Souls
can, though they would give a thousand
Worlds, be delivered at the day of God, but
such that are found written in this Book. <hi>Every
one of those that are written, though never a one of

                  <p>But, O methinks, with what careful hearts
will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the damned now begin to look for their
names in this Book? Those that, when once
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:102285:80"/>
the long suffering of God waited on them,
made light of all admonition, and slighted the
Counsel of making their Calling and Election
sure: would now give thousands of Treasures,
that they could but spy their names, though
<hi>last</hi> and <hi>least</hi> among the Sons of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but I
say, how will they fail? how will they faint?
how will they die and languish in their Souls?
when they shall still as they look, see their
names wanting. What a pinch will it be to
<hi>Cain,</hi> to see his Brother there Recorded, and
he himself left out. <hi>Absalon</hi> will now sound,
and be as one that giveth up the Ghost, when
he shall see <hi>David</hi> his Father, and <hi>Solomon</hi> his

in the Earth, among the damned? Thus I
say, will sadness be added to sadness, in the
Soul of the perishing World, when they fail of
finding their names in this part of the <hi>Book of
the life of the Lamb, slain from the foundation of
the World.</hi> Rev. 13. 8.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The second part of this Book, is
that in which is Recorded, the nature of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
of Faith, Love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And those that
have not had the effectual Word of God upon
them, and the true and saving operation of
Grace in their hearts, which is indeed the true
life which is begun in every Christian, they
will be found still not written in this Book; for

the living, the holy living Souls, are they onely
that are written therein: as the Prophet saith,
<hi>And he that remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be
called holy, even every one that is written among
the living in</hi> Jerusalem. <hi>Isa.</hi> 4. 3. Eternal life
is already in this life, begun in every Soul that
shall be saved, as Christ saith, <hi>He that believeth
in me, hath everlasting life.</hi> And again, <hi>Who so

Now will sinners begin to cry with loud
and bitter cryes, Oh! ten thousand Worlds for
a saving work of Grace, Crowns and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
for the least measure of saving Faith, and
for the love, that Christ will say, is the love of
his own Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Now they will begin also to see the work
of a broken and a contrite spirit, and of walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

But alas, these things appear in their hearts, to
the damned too late; as also do all things else.
This will be but like the repentance of the

turning off the ladder; for the unfortunate hap
of the damned will be, that the glory of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
things will not appear to them, till out

to them; as also the true nature of Faith, and
all Grace; but it will be, when the door is

repent most earnestly; but it will be in the

                  <p>Thou sayest thou art a Christian, that also
thou hast repented, dost believe, and love the

things will be found of equall length, heighth,
and bredth with the Book of Life. Or whether,
when thou art weighed in the ballance, thou
wilt yet be found wanting. <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 27. How,
if when thou comest to speak for thy self before
God, thou shouldest say <hi>Siboleth,</hi> instead of
<hi>Shiboleth:</hi> that is, though almost, yet not right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

                  <p>If thou miss but one letter in thy evidence,
thou art gone; for though thou mayst deceive
thy own heart with Brass, instead of Gold, and
with Tin instead of Silver: <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 7. yet God
will not be so put off. You know how confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
the foolish Virgins were, and yet how
they were deceived. They herded with the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:102285:83"/>
                     <hi>Saints,</hi> they went forth from the gross polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the World, they, every one had shining
Lamps, <hi>and all went forth to meet the Bridegroom,</hi>
and yet they mist the Kingdom. They were not
written among the living in <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> they
had not the true, powerful, saving work of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
of Faith, and Grace in their Souls, <hi>they
that are foolish, take their Lamps, but take no
Oyl, no saving Grace with them.</hi> Mat. 25. 1, 2, 3, 4.
Thus you see how sinners will be put to it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Judgment-Seat, from these two parts
of this Book of Life. But</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, There is yet another part of this
Book to be opened, and that is, that part of it,
in which is Recorded those noble and Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
acts, that they have done since the time of
their Conversion, and turning to Christ. Here
I say, is Recorded the Testimony of the Saints
against sin and Antichrist; their suffering for
the sake of God, their love to the members of
Christ, their patience under the Cross, and
their faithful frequenting the Assemblies of the
Saints, and their incouraging one another to
bear up in his wayes in the worst of times; even
when the proud was called happy, and when
they that wrought wickedness were even set
up. As he there saith, <hi>Then they that feared
the Lord, spake often one to another, and the Lord
hearkened and heard it, and a Book of Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:102285:83"/>
was written before him, for them that feared
the Lord, and that thought upon his Name.</hi> Mat.
3. 14, 15, 16.</p>
                  <p>For indeed, as truly as any person hath his
name found in the first part of this Book of
Life, and his Conversion in the second: so
there is a third part, in which there is his noble
spiritual and holy actions Recorded, and set
down. As it is said by the Spirit, to <hi>John,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
those that suffered Martyrdom for the
truth of Jesus, <hi>Write, blessed are the Dead that
die in the Lord, yea saith the Spirit, that they
may rest from their labours, and their works fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
them.</hi> Rev. 14. 13.</p>
                  <p>And hence it is, that the labours of the
Saints, and the Book of Life, are mentioned
together, signifying, that the travels, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
and acts of the godly, are Recorded
therein. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 3.</p>
                  <p>And hence it is again, that the Lord doth
tell <hi>Sardis,</hi> that those among them that stood it
out to the last gasp, in the Faith and Love of the
Gospel, should not be blotted out of the Book
of Life; but they, with the work of God, on
their Soul, and their labour for God in this
World: should be confessed before his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and before his Angels. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 5.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="158" facs="tcp:102285:84"/>
This part of this Book, is in another place,
called, <hi>The Book of the Word of the Lord,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
in it, I say is Recorded those famous
acts of the Saints, against the World, flesh, and
the Devil. <hi>Numb.</hi> 21. 14.</p>
                  <p>You find also, how exact the Holy Ghost is,
in Recording the travels, pains, labour, and
goodness of any of the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> in
their Journey from <hi>Egypt</hi> to <hi>Canaan,</hi> which
was a Representation of the Travels of the
<hi>Saints,</hi> from nature to Grace, and from Grace
to Glory. King <hi>Ahasuerus,</hi> kept in his Library
a Book of Records, wherein was w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>it, the
good Service that his Subjects did for him at
any time, which was a Type also of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
and order of Heaven. And as sure as
ever <hi>Mordecai,</hi> when search was made in the
Rolls, was found there to have done such and
such service for the King, and his Kingdom:
<hi>Esth.</hi> 6. 1. 2. so surely will it be found, what
every Saint hath done for God, at the day of
inquiry. You find in the Old Testament also,
still as any of the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> dyed, there
was surely a Record in the Book of <hi>Chronicles,</hi>
of their memorable acts and doings for their
God, the Church, and the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> of
<hi>Israel,</hi> which still doth further hold forth unto
the Children of men, this very thing, <hi>That all
the Kings of the New Testament, which are the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:102285:84"/>
Saints of God, have all their acts, and what they
have done for their God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> &amp;c. <hi>Recorded in the
Book of Chronicles, in the Heavenly Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now I say, when this part of the Book of
Life shall be opened, what can be found in it,
of the good deeds, and Heaven-born actions
of wicked men? Just nothing; for as it is
not to be expected, that Thorns should bring
forth Grapes, or that Thistles should bear as
Figs: so it cannot be imagined, that ungodly
men should have any thing to their Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations,
Recorded in this part of the Book of
Life. What hast thou done man, for God, in
this World? Art thou one of them that hast set
thy self against those strong struglings of pride,
lust, covetousness, and secret wickedness, that
remain in thy heart, like <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>Paul, Job 1. 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
2 Cor.</hi> 10. 4, 5.</p>
                  <p>2. And do these struglings against these
things, arise from pure love to the Lord Jesus,
or from some legall terrours and conviction
for sin? <hi>Gal.</hi> 5, 6.</p>
                  <p>3. Doest thou I say, struggle against thy
lusts, because thou doest in truth, love the
sweet, holy, and blessed leadings of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of the Lord Jesus, its leadings of thee I
say, into his blood and death, for thy Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and deliverance from wrath to com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="160" facs="tcp:102285:85"/>
4. What acts of self-denyal, hast thou done
for the name of the Lord Jesus, among the Sons
of men? I say, what house, what friend, what
Wife, what Children, and the like, hast thou
lost, or left, for the Word of God, and the
Testimony of his truth in the World. <hi>Matth.
19. 27, 28. Revel.</hi> 12. 10, 11.</p>
                  <p>5. Wast thou one of them, that didst sigh,
and afflict thy self for the abominations of the
times? and that Christ hath marked, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
for such a one? <hi>Ezek. 9. 3, 4. Zeph.</hi> 3. 18.</p>
                  <p>6. In a word, Art thou one of them, that
wouldest not be won, by neither fear, frowns,
nor flatteries, to forsake the wayes of God, or
wrong thy Conscience? or art thou one of
them that slightest those opportunities, that
Satan and this World did often give thee to
return to sin in secret. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 14, 15. These be
the men whose prayse is in the Gospel; and
whose commendable and worthy acts, are
Recorded before the Judge of all the World.
Alas, alas, these things are strange things to a
carnal and wicked man. Nothing of this hath
bin done by him in this life, and therefore how
can any such be Recorded for him in the Book
of Life: wherefore he must needs be shut out
of this part also. As <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>Let them be
blotted out of the Book of the living, and not be
written with the Righteous.</hi> Psal. 69. 28.</p>
                  <p>

Thus I say, the wicked will find nothing
for their comfort, either in the first part of this
book, where all the names of the Elect are, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will they find any thing in the second part
thereof, where is recorded the true nature and
operation of effectual Conversion, of Faith, or
Love, or the like; and I say, neither can any
thing be found in this third part, wherein is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
the worthy acts, and memorable deeds
of the Saints of the Lord Jesus. Thus when
Christ therefore hath opened before them this
book of life, and convinced the ungodly at this
day out of it; he will then shut it up again,
saying, I find nothing herein that will do you
good, you are none of my Elect, you are the
sons of perdition: For as these things will be
found clear and full in the book of life, so they
will be found effectually wrought in the hearts
of the Elect, all whose conversion and perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance

seest opened before thee, and also of thy unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate

God, to Christ, and his Word and wayes; there
was found in the Souls of the saved ones! here
shall be seen also how resolvedly, unfeignedly,
and heartily the true child of God did oppose,
resist, and war against his most dearest and

how they indured burning, starving, stoning,
hanging, and a thousand calamities; how they
manifested their love to their Lord, his Cause
and people in the worst of times, and in the
dayes when they were most rejected, slighted,
abused, and abased, <hi>then shall the King say to
them on his right hand</hi> (and that when all the
Devils and damned sinners stand by) <hi>Come ye

appears by the grace that was in your hearts)
<hi>For I was an hungred, and you gave me meat: !
was thirsty, and you gave me drink: I was a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and ye took me in; naked, and ye cloathed me;
I was sick, and you visited me; and in Prison, and

you came unto me,</hi> Matth. 25. 34, 35, 36. you
owned me, stood by me, and denyed your

our low, and weak, and most despised conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
This, I say, the World shall see, hear, and
be witnesses of, against themselves and their
Souls for ever; for how can it be, but these poor
damned sinners should be forced to confess,
that they were both Christless and Graceless,
when they shall find, both in the book of life,
and in the hearts of the holy and beloved Souls,
that which themselves are quite barren of,
and greatest strangers to. The Saints, by the
fruits of Regeneration, even in this World, do
testify to the World, not only the truth of
conversion in themselves, but also that they
are yet Christless, and so heavenless, and salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onless,
that are not converted, 1 <hi>Tim. 6. 12.
1 Thess. 2. 10. 2 Tim.</hi> 2. 2. But alas, while we
are here, they will evade this testimony, both
of our happiness, by calling our Faith, fantacy;
our communion with God, delusion; and the
sincere profession of his Word before the
World, hypocrisy, pride, and arrogancy: yet,
I say, when they see us on the right hand of
Christ, commingled among the Angels of
light, and themselves on his left hand, and
commingled with the Angels of darkness; and,
I say, when they shall see our hearts and wayes
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:102285:87"/>
opened before their eyes, and owned by the
Judg for honest hearts, and good wayes, and
yet the same wayes that they hated, slighted,
disowned and contemned; what will they, or
what can they say, but thus, <hi>We fools counted
their lives madness, and their end to be without
honour, but how are they numbred with the Saints,
and owned by God and Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And truly, was it not that the world might,
by seeing the turn that is wrought on the godly
at their Conversion, be convinced of the evil
of their wayes, or be left without excuse the
more in the day of God (with some other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons)
they should not, I am perswaded, stay so
long from Heaven as they do, nor undergo so
much abuse and hardship as frequently befalls
them. God, by the lengthening out the life
of his people that are scattered here and there
among men in this world, is making work for
the day of Judgment, and the overthrow of the
implacable, for ever and ever, and, as I have
said, will by the Conversion, life, patience,
self-denyal, and heavenly mindedness of his
dear children, give them a heavy and most
dreadful blow. Now When God hath thus

what gifts and abilities they had in this world,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:102285:87"/>
they will now see that gifts, and grace, are two
things; and also, that whosoever is graceless,
let their gifts be never so excellent, they must
perish and be lost for ever: wherefore for all
their gifts, they shall be found the workers of
iniquity, and shall so be judged and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 22, 23. That is a notable place
in the Prophecy of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> Thus saith the Lord,
saith he, <hi>If the Prince</hi> (the Prince of life) <hi>give a
gift to any of his sons,</hi> that is, to any that are
truly gracious, <hi>the inheritance,</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the exercise of his gift, he shall receive a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
<hi>but if he give a gift of his inheritance to

wherefore then will Christ say to them that
stand by, <hi>Take from him the pound, and give it to
him that hath ten p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

abide in the house for ever, though with the son it
shall be so,</hi> Joh. 8. 35. Luke 19. 24. A man
may be used as a servant in the Church of God,
and may receive many gifts, and much know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of the things of heaven, and yet at last,

himself be no more than a very bubble and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 1, 2, 3.</p>
                  <p>But now I say, at this day, they shall clearly
see the difference between gifts and grace,
even as clearly, as now they that have eyes
can see the difference between gifts and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and very foolishness: This our day doth
indeed abound with gifts; many sparkling
wits are seen in every corner, men have the
Word and truths of Christ at their fingers ends;
but alas, with many, yea, a great many, there is
naught but wits and gifts, they are but words,
all their Religion lyeth in their tongues and
heads, the power of what they say and know, it
is seen in others, not in themselves: these are
like the Lord on whom the King of <hi>Israel</hi> lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
they shall see the plenty, the blessed plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
that God doth provide, and will bestow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Church, but they shall not tast thereof,
2 <hi>Kings</hi> 7. 17, 18, 19, 20.</p>
                  <p>Before I conclude this matter, observe, that
among all the objections and cavils that are
made, and will be made, by the ungodly, in the
day of the Lord Jesus, they have not one hump
abou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> election and reprobation, they murmur
not at all that they were not predestinated to
eternal life; and the reason is, because then
they shall see, though now they are blind, that
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:102285:88"/>
God could in his Prerogative Royal, without
prejudice to them that are damned, chuse and
refuse at pleasure; and besides, they at that
day shall be convinced, that the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e was so much
reality, and downright willingness in God, in
every tender of Grace and mercy, to the worst
of men; and also so much goodness, justness,
and reasonableness in every command of the
Gospel of grace, which they were so often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
and beseeched to imbrace, that they
will be drowned in the conviction of this, that
they did refuse love, grace, reason, &amp;c. love,
I say, for hatred, grace for sin, and things rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
for things unreasonable and vain. Now
they shall see they left glory for shame, God
for the Devil, heaven for hell, light for dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
Now they shall see, that though they
made themselves beasts, yet God made the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
reasonable Creatures, and that he did with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
expect that they should have adhered to,
and have delighted in, things that are good, and
according to God: yea, now they shall see,
that though God did not determine to bring
them to Heaven against their hearts and wills,
and the love that they had to their sins: yet
then they shall be convinced, that God was
far from infusing any thing into their Souls,
that should in the least hinder, weaken, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:102285:89"/>
or let them in seeking the welfare of
their Souls. Now men will tattle and prattle
at a mad ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e, about election and reprobation,
and conclude, that because all are not elected,
therefore God is to blame that any are dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
but then they will see, that they are not
damned because they were not elected, but
because they sinned, and also that they sinned,
not because God put any weakness into their
Souls, but because they gave way, and that
wilfully, knowingly, and desperately, to Satan
and his suggestions; and so turned away from
the holy Commandment delivered unto them;
yea, then they will see, that though God at
sometimes did fasten his cords about your
heads, and heels, and hands, both by godly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation,
and smarting convictions: yet you
rusht away with violence from all, saying, <hi>Let
us break these bonds asunder, and cast their cords
from us.</hi> Psal. 2. 1, 2, 3. <hi>God will be justified
in his sayings, and clear when he judgeth;</hi> though
thy proud ignorance thinks to have, and to
multiply, cavills against him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 4.</p>
                  <p>But secondly, as the whole body of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
by the nature of conversion in their
hearts, shall witness a non-conversion in the
hearts of the wicked; and as the ungodly shall
fall under the conviction of this cloud of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.
So to increase their conviction, there
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:102285:89"/>
will also be opened before them all the labours
of the godly, both Ministers and others, and the
pains that they have taken, to save, if it had
been possible, these damned wretches; and
now will it come burning hot upon their Souls,
how often they were forewarned of this day;
now they shall see, that there was never any
Quarter-Sessions, nor general Goal-delivery
more publickly foretold of, then this day. You
know that the Judges, before they begin their
Assizes, do give to the Countrey in Charge,
That they take heed to the Laws and Statutes
of the King: Why R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 21. and c. 6. v. 13. This, I say, hast
thou heard, and seen, and yet thou hast not
held fast, but hast cast away the things that thou
hast heard, and hast bin warned of; alas, God
will multiply his Witnesses against thee.</p>
                  <p>1. Thy own Vows and Promises shall be
a Witness against thee, that thou hast, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to thy light and knowledg, destroyed thy
Soul, as <hi>Joshuah</hi> said to the children of <hi>Israel,</hi>
when they said the Lord should be their God.
<hi>Well,</hi> saith he, <hi>Ye are Witnesses against your selves,
that ye have chosen the Lord to serve him;</hi> that
is, if now you turn back again, even this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
and resolution of yours will in the
great day be a witness against you, <hi>and they said,
we are witnesses,</hi> Jos. 24. 20, 21, 22.</p>
                  <p>2. Every time you have with your mouth
said well of godliness, and yet gone on in
wickedness; or every time you have condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
sin in others, and yet have not refrained it
your selves; I say, every such word and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
that hath passed out of thy mouth, sinner,
it shall be as a witness against thee in the day
of God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, as Christ
saith, <hi>Matth. 12. 36, 37. By thy words thou shalt
be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi>
I observe, that talk with who you will,
they will with their mouth, say, serving of
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:102285:90"/>
God, and loving of Christ, and walking in
wayes of holiness is best, and best will come
of it. I observe again, that men that are gros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wicked themselves, will yet, with heavy
censures and Judgments, condemn drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
lying, cove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ousness, pride, and whoring,
with all manner of abominations in others;
and yet, in the mean time, continue to be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors
of God, and imbracers of sin and the
allurements of the flesh themselves. Why
such souls, every time they speak well of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
and continue in their sins; they do
pass Judgment upon themselves, and provide
a witness, even their own mouth, against their
own Soul, at the Judgment seat; <hi>Out of thy own
mouth,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>will I judg thee thou wicked
servant;</hi> thou knewest what I was, and that I
loved to see all my servants zealous, and active
for me, that at my comming, I might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
again what I gave thee with increase:
thou oughtest therefore to have bin busying thy
self in my work for my glory, and thy own
good, but seeing thou hast, against thy own
light, and mouth, gone contrary; Angels, take
this unprofitable servant, and cast ye him into
utter darkness, there shall be weeping and
gnashing of teeth; he sinned against his light,
he shall go to hell against his will, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25,
26, 27, 28, 29, 30.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="172" facs="tcp:102285:91"/>
The very same I say, will befall all those
that have used their mouth to condemn the sins
of others, while they themselves live in their
sins. Saith God, O thou wicked wretch, thou
didst know that sin was bad, thou didst con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
it in others; thou didst also condemn,
and passe Judgment upon them for their sin,
<hi>Thou art therefore inexcusable, a man,
whosoever thou art, that hast thus Judged;
for thou that judgest, dost the same thing:
Wherefore, wherein thou hast judged ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
thou hast condemned thy self.</hi>
I must therefore, saith Christ, look upon
thee to be no other but a sinner against thy own
mouth, and cannot but judge thee as a despiser
of my goodness, and the riches of my forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;
by which means, thou hast treasured
up wrath against this day of wrath, and Revel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the Righteous Judgment of God,
<hi>He that knoweth to do good, and doth it not, to
him it is sin.</hi> Rom. 2. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Thus will God,
I say, judge and condemn poor sinners, even
from and by themselves, to the fire, that Lake
of Brimstone and fire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly, God hath said in his Word, that
rather then there shall want witness at the day
of Judgment, against the works of iniquity:</hi>
                     <pb n="173" facs="tcp:102285:91"/>
The very dust of their City, that shall
cleave to his Messengers that publish the
Gospel, shall it self be a witness against
them; <hi>and so Christ bid his Servants
say,</hi> into whatsoever City, ye enter, and
they receive you not, go your wayes out
into the streets of the same, and say, even
the very dust of your City, which cleav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to us, we do wipe off against you, <hi>&amp;c.
But I say unto you, saith he to his Ministers,</hi>
It shall be more tolerable for Sodom at the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
then for that City. <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 10, 11, 12, 13,
14.</p>
                  <p>It may be, that when thou hearest that the
dust of the street, (that cleaveth to a Minister
of the Gospel, while thou rejectest his word
of Salvation) shall be a witness against thee
at the day of Judgment: though wilt be apt to
laugh, and say, the dust a Witness! Witnesses
will be scarce where dust is forced to come
in to plead against a man. Well sinner, mock
not, God doth use to confound the great and
mighty, by things that are not, and that are
despised. And how sayst thou? if God had
said by a Prophet to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> but two years
before the Plague, that he would shortly come
against him with one Army of Lice, and a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:102285:92"/>
Army of Frogs, and with a third Army of
Locusts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and would destroy his Land; dost
thou think it had bin wisdom in <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> now
to have laughed such tydings to scorn? <hi>Is any
thing to hard for the Lord?</hi> hath he said it, and
shall he not bring it to passe? You shall see, in
the day of Judgment, of what force all these
things will be, as witnesses against the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly.</p>
                  <p>Many more witnesses might I here reckon
up, but these at this time shall suffice to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated;
for out of the mouth of two or three
witnesses, every word shall be established. <hi>And
at the mouth of two or three Witnesses, shall he that
is worthy of death, be put to death.</hi> 2 Cor. 13. 1.
<hi>Deut. 17. 6. Joh.</hi> 8. 17.</p>
                  <p>Thus then the Books being opened, the
Laws read, the witnesses heard, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
convicted: forthwith the Lord and
Judge proceeds to execution. And to that
end, doth passe the sentence of eternall death
upon them, saying, <hi>Depart from me ye cursed,
into everlasting fire, prepared for the Devill and
his Angels.</hi> You are now by the Book of the
Creatures, by the Book of Gods Remembrance,
by the Book of the Law, and by the Book of
Life, adjudged guilty of High Treason against
God, and me; and as murderers of your own
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:102285:92"/>
Souls. As these faithful and true witnesses
here have testified, every one of them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
in their most upright testimony against
you. Also you never had a saving work of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
and faith, past upon you, you died in
your sins; neither can I find any thing in the
last part of this Book that will serve your
turn, no worthy act is here Recorded of you.
<hi>When I was an hungred, you gave me no
meat; When I was a thirsty, you gave me
no drink; When I was a stranger, you took
me not in; I was naked, but ye cloathed
me not; I was sick and in prison, but ye
visited me not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have made a thorow search among the
Records of the Living, and find nothing of
you, or of your deeds therein: <hi>Depart from
me ye cursed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 41, 42, 43.</p>
                  <p>Thus will these poor ungodly Creatures be
stript of all hope and comfort, and therefore
must needs fall into great sadness and wailing,
before the Judge; yea, crying out, as being loath
to let go all for lost, and even as the man that
is fallen into the River, will catch hold of any
thing, when he is struggling for life, though it
tend to hold him faster under the water, to
drownd him. So, I say, while these poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:102285:93"/>
as they lie strugling and twining under
the ireful countenance of the Judge; they
will bring out yet one more faint and weak
groan, and there goes life and all; their last
sigh is this, <hi>Lord, when saw we thee an
hungred, and gave thee no meat? or when
saw we thee thirsty, and gave thee no
drink? When saw we thee a stranger, and
took thee not in? or naked, and cloathed
thee not? or when wast thou sick, or in
prison, and we did not minister unto thee?</hi>
Mat. 25. 44.</p>
                  <p>Thus you see, how loath the sinner is now
to take a Nay of life everlasting. He that once
would not be perswaded to close with the Lord
Jesus, though one should have perswaded him
with tears of blood: behold how fast he now
hangs about the Lord, what Arguments he
frames with mournful groans; how with
shifts and words, he seeks to gain the time, and
to defer the execution; Matth. 25. 10, 11.
<hi>Lord open unto us! Lord, Lord, open unto
us! Lord, thou hast taught in our streets,
and we have both taught in thy name, and
in thy name have we cast out Devils.</hi> Mat.
7. 21, 22, 23. <hi>VVe have eat and drank
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:102285:93"/>
in thy presence. And when did we see thee
an hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
or sick, or in prison, and did not mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
to thee?</hi> Luk. 13. 25, 26, 27, 28.
O poor hearts, how loath? how unwillingly
do they turn away from Christ? how loath are
they to partake of the fruit of their ungodly
doings? Christ must say, depart once, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
twice, before they will depart. When he
hath shut the door upon them, yet they knock,
and cry, <hi>Lord open unto us;</hi> when he hath
given them their answer, <hi>that he knowes them
not,</hi> yet they plead and mourn. Wherefore, he
is fain to answer again, <hi>I tell you, I know you
not whence you are, depart.</hi> Luk. 13. 25, 26,
27.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Depart</hi>] O this word, <hi>depart!</hi> how dreadful
is it? with what weight will it fall on the
head of every condemned sinner! for you
must note, that while the ungodly stand thus
before the Judge: they cannot chuse but have
a most famous view, both of the Kingdom of
Heaven, and of the damned wights in Hell.
Now they see the God of Glory, the King of
Glory, the Saints of Glory, and the Angels of
Glory; and the Kingdom in which they have
their eternal aboad. Now, they also begin to
see the worth of Christ, and what it is to be
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:102285:94"/>
miled upon by him; from all which they
must depart, and as I say, they shall have the
view of this, so they will most famously be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold

fire, but everlasting fire. <hi>Behold how great a
fire a little matter kindleth.</hi> A little sin, a little
pleasure, a little unjust dealing and doing:
what preparation is made for the punishment
thereof. And hence it is, that the fire into
which the damned f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ll, is called the Lake, or
Sea of fire. <hi>And whosoever, saith</hi> John, <hi>was
not found written in the Ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>k of Life, was cast
into the Lake of fire and Brimstone.</hi> Revel. 20.
15. Little did the sinner seriously think, that
when he was sinning against God, he was
making such provision for his poor Soul; but
now 'tis to late to repent, <hi>his worm must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:102285:95"/>
die, and his fire never shall be quenched.</hi> Mark
9. 49. Though the time in which men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
sin, is short, yet the time of Gods punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them for their sin, is long.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire,
prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi>] In that
he saith, prepared for the Devil and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels:
he insinuates a further conviction upon
the Consciences of the damned. As if he had
said, as for this fire and Lake that you must go
to, though you thought but little of it, because
you were careless, yet I did betimes, put you in
mind of what would be the fruits of sin, even
by preparing of this Judgment for the Devil
and his Angels. The Devil in his Creation, is
far more noble then you, yet when he sinned, I
spared him not. He sinned also before man
and I, upon his sinning, did cast him down
from Heaven to Hell, and did hang the Chains
of everlasting darkness upon him, which
might, yea, ought to have bin a fair item to
you to take heed; but you would not. <hi>Jud. 6.
Gen. 31. 2, 3, 4, 5. Rev.</hi> 20. 1. Wherefore, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you have sinned as he hath done, and that
too, after he had both sinned, and was bound
over to eternal punishment: the same Justice
that layeth hold on these more noble Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:102285:95"/>
must surely seize on you. The World
should be convinced of Judgment then, <hi>because
the Prince of the World is judged.</hi> Joh. 6. 8, 9, 10.
And that before they came to this condition of
hearing the eternal sentence rattle in their
ears; but seeing they did not regard it then,
they must and shall feel the smart of it now.
<hi>Depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire,
prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>God would have men learn both what mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and Justice is to them, by his shewing it to
others; but if they be sottish and careless in
the day of forbearance, they must learn by
smarting in the day of rebukes, and vengeance.
Thus it was with the old World, God gave
them one hundred and twenty years warning,
by the preparation of <hi>Noah</hi> for the floud that
should come; but for as much as they then were
careless, and would not consider the works of
the Lord, nor his threatning them by this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration:
therefore he brought in the floud
upon the World of the ungodly. As he doth
hear the last Judgment upon the workers of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
and sweep them all away in their wilful
ignorance. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 37, 38, 39.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore I say, the Lord Chief Judge, by
these words [<hi>prepared for the Devill and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi>]
doth as good as say, this fire into which
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:102285:96"/>
now I send you, it did of it self, even in the
preparation of it, (had you considered it) fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warn
you of this that now is come upon you.
Hell fire is no new, or unheard of thing, you
cannot now plead, that you heard not of it in
the Wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ld, neither could you with any reason
judge, that seeing I prepared it for Angels, for
noble, powerful, and mighty Angels; that you
poor dust and ashes should escape the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Depart from me ye cursed, into everlasting fire,
prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi> The sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
being thus passed, it remains now, the
work being done, that every one goeth to his
eternal station. Wherefore, forthwith this
mighty Company, do now with heavy heart,
return again from before the Judgment-Seat:
and that full hastily, God knoweth, for their
proper Center, is the Hell of Hell; into which
they descend like a stone into a Well, <hi>or like</hi>
Pharaoh <hi>into the bottom of the red Sea.</hi> Exod. 15.
10. For all hope being now taken from them,
they must needs fall with violence, into the
Jaws of eternal desperation, which will deal
far worse with the souls of men, and make a
greater slaughter in their tortured consciences,
then the Lions in the Den with <hi>Daniel,</hi> could
possibly do with the men that were cast in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them. <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. 24.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="183" facs="tcp:102285:96"/>
This is that which <hi>Paul</hi> calleth <hi>Eternall
Judgement,</hi> Heb. 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. because it is that which
is last and finall. Many are the Judgments that
God doth execute among the Sons of Men,
some after this manner, and some after that,
divers of which, continue but for a while, and
none of them are eternal, no, the very Devils
and damned spirits in Hell, though there is the
longest and most terrible of all the Judgments
of God, yet on foot: yet I say, they must pass
under another Judgment, even this last, great
and finall Judgment. <hi>The Angels that kept not
their first state, but left their own Habitation, he
hath reserved in everlasting Chains under dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
unto the Judgment of the great day.</hi> Jude 6.
And so also it is with damned souls; for bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h
<hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorah,</hi> with all other, though al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
in Hell in their souls: yet they must (as
I have before shewed) all arise to this judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which will be their finall judgement. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the judgements of God, as they have an
end, so the end of many of them prove the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of those on whom they are inflicted, being I
say, Gods Instruments of Conversion to sinners:
and so may fitly be compared to those petty
judgements among men, as putting in the
stocks, whipping, or burning in the hand:
which punishments, and judgements, do often
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:102285:97"/>
prove profitable to those that are punished
with them; but eternal judgement, it is like
those more severe judgements among men, as
beheading, shooting to death, hanging, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and quartering which soop all, even health,
time, and the like, and cut off all opportunity
of good, leaving no place for mercy or amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
<hi>these shall go away into everlasting punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 40. This word, <hi>depart,</hi> &amp;c.
is the last word the damned for ever are like to
hear. I say, it is the last voice, and therefore
will stick longest, and with most power on their
slaughtered souls: there is no calling of it back
again, it is the very wind-up of <hi>Eternall
Judgement.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus then, the judgement being over, the
Kingdom ceaseth to be any longer in the hand
of the Man <hi>Christ Jesus;</hi> for as the <hi>Judges</hi> here
among men, when they have gone their Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit,
do deliver up their Commission to the
King: so Christ the <hi>Judge,</hi> doth now deliver
up his Kingdom to his Father. And now all is
swallowed up of Eternity. <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 8. The
damned are swallowed up of eternal justice
and wrath; the saved, of eternal life and feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city;
and the Son also delivereth up, I say, the
Kingdom to the Father, and subjects himself
under him that did put all things under him,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:102285:97"/>
that God may be all in all, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 24, 25,
26, 27, 28.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For now is the end come, and not before,
even the end of the reign of death it self; for
Death, and Hell, and sinners, and Devils, must
now together into the Lake, that burns with fire
and Brimstone.</hi> Rev. 20. 14, 15. <hi>And now is the
end of Christs Reign, as the Son of Man, and
the end of the Reign of the Saints, with him in
this his Kingdom, which he hath received of
his Father, for his work sake, which he did for
him, and for his Elect.</hi> Then cometh the end faith
<hi>Paul,</hi> when he shall have delivered up the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to God the Father: But when shall that be?
why, he answers, <hi>saying,</hi> When he shall have put
down all Rule, and all Authority and Power; for
he must reign, saith he, untill he hath put all his
enemies under his feet, (<hi>which will not be, untill
the finall Sentence and Judgment be over;</hi>) for
the last enemy that shall be destroyed, is death. <hi>For</hi>
God hath put all things under his feet, but when he
saith, all things are put under him: it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested,
he is accepted, that did put all things under
him. And when all things shall be subdued unto
him, then shall the Son also himself be subject to
him, that did put all things under him, that God
may be all in all.</p>
                  <p>All things being now at this pass, to wit,
every one being in its proper place, God in his,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:102285:98"/>
Christ in his, the Saint in his, and the Sinner
in his; I shall conclude with this brief touch
upon both the state of the Good and Bad after
this Eternal Judgment.</p>
                  <p>1. The Righteous now shall never fear
Death, the Devill, and Hell more: And the
Wicked shall never hope of life.</p>
                  <p>2. The Just shall ever have the Victory
over these things: But the Wicked shall ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastingly
be swallowed up of them.</p>
                  <p>3. The Holy shall be in everlasting Light:
But the Sinner in everlasting Darkness. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
light, I say, yet in Fire ever burning, yet
not consumed, always afraid of death and hell,
vehemently desiring to be annihi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ted to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
Continually fearing to stay long in
Hell, and yet certainly sure they shall never
come out of it. Ever desiring the Saints hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,
and yet alwayes envying their felicity.
They would have it, because it is easie and
Comfortable; yet cannot abide to think of it,
because they have lost it for ever. Ever loaden
with the delight of sin: and yet that is the
greatest torture, alwayes desiring to put it out
of their Mind, and yet assuredly know they
must for ever abide the guilt and torment
thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="187" facs="tcp:102285:98"/>
4. The Saints are always inflamed with the
Consideration of the Grace that once they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced:
but the Wicked, most flamingly tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
with the thoughts of rejecting and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing
it.</p>
                  <p>5. The Just, when they think of their sins,
they are comforted with the thoughts of their
being delivered from them; but the Ungodly,
when they think of their righteousness, will
gnaw themselves, to think that this would not
deliver them from Hell.</p>
                  <p>6. When the Godly think of Hell, it will
increase their Comfort; but when the Wicked
think of Heaven, it will twinge them like a
Serpent. Oh this Eternal Judgment! What
would a damned Soul give, that there might
be, though after Thousands and Hundreds of
Thousands of Millions of Years, an end put to
this Eternal Judgment. But their misery is,
they have sinned against a God that is Eternal;
they have offended that Justice that will never
be satisfied; and therefore they must abide
the Fire that never shall be quenched. Here
is Judgment, Just, and Sad.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="188" facs="tcp:102285:99"/>
Again, As it will be thus with Good and
Bad in general, so again, more particularly,
when the Wicked are thus adjudged and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
and also received of the Fiery Gulph;
then they shall find, That as he that busieth
himself to do good, shall have more glory
than others; So they that have been more
busie and active in sin than others, they shall
have more Wrath and Torment than others.
For as doing good abundantly, doth inlarge the
Heart to receive and hold more Glory; So
doing evil abundantly, doth inlarge the Heart
and Soul to receive Punishment so much the
more. And hence it is that you have such
Sayings as these, <hi>It shall be more tolerable in the
Judgment for</hi> Sodome, <hi>than for others;</hi> that is,
then for those that had sinned against much
greater Light and Mercy: <hi>For these,</hi> as he saith
in another place, <hi>shall receive greater Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
Yea, it standeth to reason, that he who
had most Light, most Conviction, most means
of Conversion, and that was highest towards
Heaven, he must needs have the greatest Fall,
and so sink deepest into the Jaws of Eternal
Misery, <hi>Luke 10. 12. Luke</hi> 20. 47. As one
Star, that is, as one Saint, differeth from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
in Heaven; so one damned Soul shall
differ from another in Hell. It is so among
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:102285:99"/>
the Devils themselves, they are some worse
than others: <hi>Matth. 9. 34. Mar. 3. 22. Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebub</hi>
is <hi>the Prince;</hi> or <hi>the Chief of the Devils;</hi>
That is, One that was most glorious in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
Chief among the reprobate Angels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Fall, <hi>Isa.</hi> 14. 2. and therefore sinned
against the greater Light, Mercy, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
and so became the Chief for wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and will also have as the wages thereof,
the Chief of Torments. For that will be true
of the damned in Hell, which is prayed for
against <hi>Babylon.</hi> Revel. 18. 7. <hi>How much she
hath glorified her self, and lived deliciously; so
much torment and sorrow give her.</hi> Can it be
imagined, that <hi>Judas</hi> should have no more
torment, who betrayed the Prince of Life and
Saviour of the World, than others who never
came near his Wickedness by ten thousand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees?
<hi>He that know his Masters Will, and
prepared not himself, neither did according to his
Will, shall be beaten with many stripes.</hi> With
many mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e stripes, than others that through
ignorance did commit sin worthy of many
stripes. But what should I thus discourse of
the degrees of the Torments of the damned
Souls in Hell? For he that suffers least, will
the waters of a full Cup be wrung out to him.
The least measure of wrath, it will be
the Wrath of God, eternal and fiery Wrath,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:102285:100"/>
insupportable wrath; it will lay the Soul in
the Gulph of that Second Death, which will
for ever have the Mastery over the poor damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
perishing Sinner. <hi>And Death and Hell
were cast into the Lake of Fire: which is the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Death. And whosoever was not found in the
Book of Life, was cast into the Lake of fire,</hi> Rev.
20. 14, 15.</p>
