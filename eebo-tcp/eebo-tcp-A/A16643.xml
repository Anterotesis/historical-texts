         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Owsoeuer earthly kingdoms do prosper best, when
peace is had, yet the church of Christ which is his
throne,<note place="margin">Cassi. in Psa. 1.</note> receiueth good euen by dissention, <hi>Inde
crescit Ecclesia, vnde mundus deficit.</hi> Therfore
although a good agreement in al affaires ought to be regarded,
yet a dissent in religion doth sometime profit, inasmuch as ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the faith of some is exercised, the inconstancie of others is
made manifest, and the diligence of all those whom deep securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
hath not ouerwhelmed, is much quickned vnto the serching
of the truth. The rent that is made by some, hath confirmed this
vnto vs by experience, whiles that the constancie of such as are
wise hearted, is made manifest; the vanitie of those that are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stedfastly
minded is laide open; &amp; the godly are made acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with those ancient heresies, whereof in times past they were
both ignorant and carelesse. The disturbances of our Church
are many, proceeding from one fountaine, though they bee not
all of one nature; Satan hath sent them, they are like vnto him,
disagreeing one with another, and at iarre in themselues, and yet
are all opposite vnto the truth. For the Atheists and Papists are
at as great defiance one with another, as euer was Herod and
Pilate.<note place="margin">Luk. 23. 12</note> And the Anabaptists and Donatists condemne each the
other for matters of religion, as much as the Pharesies did the
Saduces; and yet as they could bee reconciled,<note place="margin">Math. 22.</note> rather then the
Church should inioy her peace; so these will sooner iustifie one
another, than they will submit themselues vnto the truth. But
the bush which Msoses sawe perished not, though it was compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with a flame: and the Church of God through his gracious
prouidence doth stand fast, though the securitie of Atheists, the
Idolatrie of Papists, and the impietie of the rest, haue threatned
an ouerthrow: yea, it is now come to passe, that although no he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie
is without some fauourers, yet the deuises euen of the most
skilfull deceiuers, haue bene so laid vpon, that not one of those is
thought vpon of sober mindes, but with detestation. <hi>I</hi> grant that
men voide of reason may thinke reuerently of them, because wee
see the Donatist condemning Donatisme, a schisme which hee
himselfe vpholdeth, which is a verie dronkennes, though it bee
without wine;<note place="margin">Aug. contra Cresco. lib. 5</note> but wisedome is iustified of her children.</p>
            <p>The Donatists in the yeere of our Lorde 290. or as some
write 353. by their preposterous dealings disturbed the churches
in all those partes where they remained.<note place="margin">August. Bonif. Epist. 50.</note> With vaine impuden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
they condemned all the Churches of God,<note place="margin">Aug. ad quod vult deum, de haer. cat.</note> and affirmed that
the Church was in the partes of Donatus onely. Also in vphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that the Church of Christ is without spot or wrinkle, or
<pb facs="tcp:244:4"/>
grosse pollution; they did falsely charge Coecilianus the Bishop
of Carthage with certaine crimes, taking occasion therevpon to
separate themselues from the Church; They did account the
Sacraments to be no Sacraments,<note place="margin">Aug. in Psa. 10. Retrac. lib. 1. cap. 21. Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riano. Epist. 21. Contra Epist. Parmeniani, lib. 1. cap 7 Aug. Donat.

that approued not their schisme; And therevpon, though Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus
did not institute rebaptization, yet his successors rebapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
those that came vnto them. They taught that it was vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to seeke vnto the magistrate for aide in causes of the church,
because they were the Lords free people. To be short, that men
are not to be compelled vnto good duties, that they are to vow a
constancie in their schisme, that they were ready to prouoke
the sword of the magistrate against themselues, that they might
brag of sufferings: these and such like were the fruites of Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme.
Now Donatus the first author of this schisme, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
for an heretique, and his doctrine for hereticall, in the
daies of Constantine, by the councel of Carthage; and from time
to time euer since it hath ben so accounted of, not onely of the
Church of God, but also of such as abhorre the name, but main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
the doctrine of this schisme.</p>
            <p>This is it that the malcontents of our age do greedilie hunt
after the annoiance of our church; condemne it and all other
Churches that are not partakers of their faction; crie out that
the true church is without spot or wrinkle, or grosse pollution,
take libertie to slaunder those that are in authoritie, so to free
themselues from all submission: affirme that the Sacraments are
no Sacraments. (Whervpon though the renuer of this schisme,
Browne I meane,<note place="margin">Some of their owne compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed it.</note> did not in plaine wordes require a baptising a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
yet their succossors in their established Church attempted
it) haue taught, that they being the Lordes free people, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
is not to deale in causes ecclesiasticall: holde that men
are not to be compelled to good duties, binde one another with
a vow to persist in this faction, boast of suffrings, &amp;c. &amp; yet detest
the name of Donatisme, though Donatus was the first deuiser, &amp;
of Brownisme, though Brown was the only restorer of these fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies.
The forerunners it should seeme, were grosse, when their
Disciples are ashamed to be accounted their schollers: yet if anie
grossenesse as yet vnnamed, either in matters of faith, or manner
of dealing be found in them, it will appeare in these also; for it is
no new fansie but an ancient heresie, neither is there hope that
they will be restrained but by an olde remedie: For as the Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists
when councels were called conference was had, and they
were conuicted, yet gaue it out with great glorie, that they had
put to silence all the learned,<note place="margin">August. ret. li. 2 cap. 26. &amp; Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifacio. epi. 50</note> and remained wilfull, vntill that by
the sharp laws of Honorius, they were restrained, yea and many
of them by that meanes were brought againe to the Church: so
<pb facs="tcp:244:4"/>
with our men all gentle meanes haue bene vsed: in conference
hard speeches haue onelie helped them, yet remaine they obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
and brag of victorie: if the lawes of our christian Honorius
doe them no good, they are incurable. No doubt the Phisition is
irke some to a frantique person, and a father to an vnrulie child,
the one in binding, the other in striking, and both in louing. The
dutie of a phisition, and the nature of a father must appeare in
the magistrate, not in satisfieng the desires of the froward to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
them, but in restraining their phrensie to profite them. It
may bee to the discontentment of some, that anie punishment
should be inflicted vpon them for their disordered stubburnnes,
<hi>I</hi> would not be mistaken,<note place="margin">In his confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with m. Cooper, pa. 49</note> I wish it not, howsoeuer m. Greenwood
affirmeth that the magistrate ought to compell vnto the hearing
of the word. Only this I saie, that the lesse these matters are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
of, the better may the men be conceiued of, but view their
writings, examine their doctrine, and marke their dealings, and
they will appeare the open enemies of Gods truth: for in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to establish a church, they ouerthrowe the church, and
vnder the colour of setting vp the discipline of Christ, they seeke
to plague themselues and others with their owne dreams, which
in this their treatise of discipline, and in their two other treati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
of certaine conferences lately by them published, shall bee
made manifest to the indifferent reader. In answering of them
al (onelie the calumniations in the conferences excepted, which
concerne some particular persons, whose cause I leaue to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
who best know how farre they are abused, and in regorde
thereof can best answere the same) I haue followed the authors
method, leauing the man, and seeing into the matter, not regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
who wrote it, but what is the doctrine that is maintained by
him. As for the treatise of the visible Church, it will appeare not
tollerable, inasmuch as it is impious, abusing the Scripture, iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

vnto it, but haue in them many bitter speeches &amp; vngodlie slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
both of Church, Magistracie, Ministerie, and all: wherby it
seemeth that the author hath not learned to rule his pen. In this
mine attempt I haue small hope to satisfie those that are wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to their will, when Gaudentius was answered sufficientlie to
his follies, hee would notwithstanding returne his aunswere
though he did the same,<note place="margin">Aug. ret. lib. 2 cap. 59.</note> 
               <hi>nulla ratione respondens, sed magis
se nec respondere, nec tacere potuisse declarans.</hi> If our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor

companie, who with words and bitter speeches sought to vphold
their cause, &amp; if he vse the Scriptures, let him applie them faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
<pb facs="tcp:244:5"/>
and then if he preuaile the controuersie will be at end. In
the meane while if these poore labours of mine might satisfie
these discontented persons; or failing hereof, might staie the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
from beeing seduced, or else might prouoke them that
are better able to deale more substantially in these matters, I shal
be glad. Finally, I am to intreate the reader both to accept in

false, yet packed vp with euident
truthes, that the certaintie of these might
free the other of suspition. The manner
of dealing is to pester the margent with a
cloud of witnesses to smal purpose, onely
they make the ignorant beleeue, that he
which gain-saith this booke, doth speake
against the word of God. But how vainly
this is done, it will appeare by the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the particulars. Seeing the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and gouernment of the church (say
they) is like vnto the Lord thereof, it
must be granted, that as God is euer
one and the same: so is his church which
professeth one truth, holdeth one faith,
and is guided by that order which God
hath reuealed in his word. Our answere
is, that we do acknowledge one God the
father, sonne, &amp; holy ghost, his truth our
faith, and the meanes of our saluation to
be vnchangeable; we confesse likewise
one catholike church, which is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of saints, which iointly and seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
do confesse that saluation is obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in and through Iesus Christ alone.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:244:7"/>
This church comprehendeth in it both
angels and men,<note place="margin">Col. 1. 18. 19. 20.</note> the one sort continuing
in, the other sort restored vnto that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
wherein they stand; and all obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
this sentence of being perfitly righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
in and thorough the head of that
church, whereof they are members, euen
Iesus Christ our Lord. This is the church
which they say must be guided by one
rule, euen <hi>the word of the most high.</hi> Now
we desire to know in what sence <hi>the word
of the most high</hi> is taken; for if they meane
thereby the prouidence of God, in which
sence it is sometimes taken, as Deut. 8. 3.
&amp; Heb. 1. 3. we do agree in this clause al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so.
But the places quoted in the margent,
do shew that it is meant of the reuealed
will of God contained in his word; For
Deut. 6. 25. Moses telleth the Israelites
that the obseruing of all the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Lord their God, wil be their
righteousnes. Paul Rom. 10. 8. saith, that
the worde of God was in their mouth, &amp;
in their hart euen the word of faith which
vvas preached. Againe 2. Tim. 3. 15. hee
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:244:8"/>
sheweth Timothie that the scriptures
are able to make him wise vnto saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
thorough the faith that is in Christ
Iesus. Christ in the eight Chapter of
Iohn and the one and fiftith verse, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
that if a man keepe his vvorde,
he shall neuer see death. Lastly Iohn
saith, 1. Iohn. 2. 3. By this vve knovv that
vve know him, if we keepe his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements.
It is euident that these places
do speake of the word of God, which is
giuen vnto vs to be our guide in this life,
for the gathering togither of the saints
during their abode in this world: but
when life ceaseth, the vse of this word
of God doth cease in the Church of
God, as appeareth in the first to the
Corinthians the thirteenth chapter and
eight verse, Colossians the first chapter
and the three and twentith verse, &amp;c.
Therefore to say that the whole church,
that is, both angels in heauen, the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
departed out of this life, and the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
remaining vpon the earth are all alike
gouerned by this rule, doth bewray ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:244:8"/>
a foule ignorance, or a foolish rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
VVhich rash ignorance if in this
one matter it had shewed it selfe onely,
it had bene more tollerable, then it can
be when it alledgeth manie scriptures
to prooue the truth, so vnseasonablie as
here it doth about the vnitie of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
&amp;c. For the two first places, the first
chapter of Genisis and the first verse,<note place="margin">So they speake in the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of the church ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant.</note>
the twentith Chapter of Exodus and
the third verse, do mention God in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of his soueraigntie ouer all things,
but they speake of him as <hi>the inheritour of
mount Sion his Church:</hi> wherefore that of
saint Paul in the first to Timothie, the
second chapter and fourth verse, might
haue bene sufficient both for the proofe
of this, and also that there is but one
truth, one faith, &amp;c: Vnto the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
whereof it is the will of God that
men should come and be saued.<note place="margin">In a pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet, the question being of the best prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers in England<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

say they, <hi>that you are able to iustifie
that faith which they beget:</hi> their reason is,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:244:9"/>
because our worshipping of God is not
ioyned with their discipline, for we hold
that faith which Paul approueth.) As for
the testimonie which Paul giueth of Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phroditus,<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 25.</note>
that he is <hi>his brother, companion
in labor, and fellow souldier,</hi> It is a weake
proofe of that whereunto it is referred,
so is that of the Iewes,<note place="margin">Iohn. 8. 41</note> saying that they
haue all one father, euen God, which
Christ denyeth vnto them in the verse
next following. These things are spoken,
not to call that into question which in it
selfe is true, but to shew what discretion
hath bene vsed in the choise, and alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

complete in him who is the head of all

his warrant, such as it is, for it is here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
by the couenant made with Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
Gen. 17. and by the vision of Iohn,
Reuel. 7. 9. VVhich places do not proue
the matter, in as much as they speake of
the restoring and preseruation of man
onely, and not of the whole bodie of the
church. The other three places alledged
are lesse to purpose. Peter 1. Pet. 1. 2.
writeth vnto the church, which was scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
ouer the face of the earth; so that
he speaketh not of the vniuersall church
of God, but of that which was in his age.
Paul saith, 1. Cor. 10. 3. that <hi>the fathers did
eate one spirituall meat:</hi> But they were not
the vniuersall church of God, he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
only of those that were before him.
Christ prayeth for his Apostles, Ioh. 17.
20. and not for them onely, but for those
which should beleeue in him thorough
their pearching: he prayeth not for the
vniuersall church, viz. all that haue bene,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:244:10"/>
are, or shalbe, but for those which being
aliue, should inioy the ministery of his
Apostles. But it may be the authors mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
is not out of euery of these seueral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but from them al ioyntly to conclude
this vniuersal church, for as much as Paul
speaketh of those which haue bene, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
speaketh of those that are, and Christ
mentioneth those that shalbe. VVhich
though we should grant, yet they all
mention but mankind onely, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
not all the elect of God: for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
which are vnder the couenant, and
departing this life before they are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of the ministerie of the word, are not
comprehended within the number of
those which Christ in that place prayed
for, Peter did write vnto, &amp;c. so that these
places iointly taken, do not conteine so
much of the vniuersall church as the two
first places: &amp; though they did, yet they
do not comprehend the whole as hath
bene said. Thus a good dish may be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

But was not the house of Adam the

In the visible church of God
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:244:11"/>
there will be tares, yea vntill the haruest:
chaffe among the wheat,<note place="margin">Matth. 13. 30. &amp; 3. 12. &amp; 25. 32.</note> goates among

and other monstrous men abiding in the
church,<note place="margin">2. Thess. 2. 4. Iudg. 4. Treatise of the church apparant.</note> turning the grace of God into
wantonnesse. But they do confesse that
<hi>there may be pollutions in the manners of men
being secret, which they leaue vnto God: but
if they be such spots and wrinkles, as declare
the church not to be glorious, then no apparant</hi>
church. VVhat spots they can finde grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than those before mentioned I know
not: yet this I adde, that the church at
Ierusalem was not greatly glorious in
the dayes of Herods tyrannie, when also
the office of the high Priest was diuided
to two: Nor from the dayes of Malachy
vntill the comming of Christ, during all
which time there was a deepe silence of
the word. Nor in the captiuitie of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,
as appeareth by the prophesie of
Zacharie.<note place="margin">Zach. 3. &amp; 5. Esa. 1. 6.</note> Nor in the daies of Hussia, Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,
Achaz, and Hezechia, when Esay
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:244:12"/>
complained that there was no whole
part from the sole of the foote to the
head, but wounds &amp; swellings, and sores
full of corruption. Nor in the time of
Dauid,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 13.</note> when the incest of one of his
sonnes,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 15.</note> the traiterous attempts of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 11.</note>
yea the sinnes committed by Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid
himself were most abhominable. And
yet I hope the Author will acknowledge
these to haue bene the apparant church
of God, euen in the midst of grosse pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions.
Therefore it is not necessary for
the <hi>esse</hi> or being of the church apparant,
that euerie member therof be faithfull,
&amp;c. How is this therefore proued? here
is quoted Psal. 111. 1. <hi>I will praise the Lord
with my whole heart in the secret meetings of
the iust, and in their congregation,</hi> that is,
both publikely and priuatly, wheresoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
the iust do meete. Also Psal. 149. 1.
where he calleth the said meetings, <hi>the
congregation of the godly.</hi> But in these pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
Dauid neither saith, that it is vnpos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
for a wicked man to ioyne with the
faithfull in outward dueties; nor yet
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:244:12"/>
that the presence of the vngodly ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can
cause the assembly not to be the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of the iust or godly, which is the
matter that should haue bin concluded.
Now wheras the church is called an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
people, Esa. 62. 12. &amp; Deut. 14. 2. it is in
regard that they were the seed of him,
with whom the couenant was made:<note place="margin">Rom. 9. 4, &amp;c.</note> but
howsoeuer in respect hereof the adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
pertained to them, &amp; the glory, &amp; the
couenant, &amp; the giuing of the Law &amp; the
seruice of God, &amp; the promises, of whom
are the fathers, and of whom concerning
the flesh Christ came, and therfore were
called an holy people: yet neither are all

as for the church of Ephesus, Eph. 1. 1. &amp; of
Corinth, Cor. 1. 2. they are indeed called
saints: but can we truly say that there was
no pollution knowne among them? the
matter is plain, that eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at that instant, as
appeareth by both the Epistles, al things
were not so well in these churches as
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:244:13"/>
were to be wished. Therefore, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
these churches are called saints,
Israel holy, and the assemblie of such as
worship God, a congregation of the iust:
yet there may be a visible church of God
though some member thereof be not
faithfull. This people, saith our Author,
must be also <hi>holy:</hi> for proofe whereof
is brought Deut. 12. 5. where the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are commanded to worship in the
place which the Lord should choose.
But I pray you, when some of them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed

Achab,<note place="margin">2. Chro. 33.</note> who worshipped in the house of
Baal, Manasses, and others, did the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God cease to be the church of
God? in no wise. VVe grant that Gods
ordinances ought to be regarded, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in matters concerning his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship:
but this is not the matter in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion;
but whether the breaking of them
by some one man, can make the people
of God to be no people vnto him? for
this is it, that should haue bene conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:244:13"/>
Next to this is alledged Iohn. 6. 37.
which place, that it may the better be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
we are to remember, that in
the verse immediatly going before,
Christ had said, <hi>Ye haue seene me and beleeue
not:</hi> the he addeth, <hi>All that my father gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
me, shall come vnto me:</hi> whereby he
sheweth that the gift of faith is the free
election of the father in Christ: so that
faith is a certaine testimonie of election
to the faithfull. The argument standeth
thus. No man can come vnto Christ and
beleeue in him, except it be giuen him of
the father: therefore euerie member of
the visible church is holy.<note place="margin">In a treatise which they haue scatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red abroad.</note> Surely it is no
maruell that the knowledge of the libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
sciences is condemned as an exercise
of curious arts; but if they knew these
Arts, no doubt they would be ashamed
to abuse themselues &amp; others with such
sencelesse kinde of reasoning. Besides,
what meaneth this, that to prooue the
people of God faithfull, are alledged
scriptures that speake of holines? as Esa.
62. 12. &amp; Deut. 14. 2. And now to proue
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:244:14"/>
their holinesse, faith is mentioned? If
faith and holinesse be all one, why are
they noted as diuers with <hi rend="sup">e</hi> &amp; <hi rend="sup">f</hi>? if they be
not all one, why is the handling of them
thus confounded? in one of these must
be acknowledged a foule ouersight.
Then followeth to proue the holinesse of
the church aforesaid, Iohn. 3. 14. &amp; 12.
32. both which places doe shew, that
Christ will draw his elect vnto him: the
first doth shew the meanes whereby this
shalbe done, namely, by the ministerie
of his word, which is signified by his lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
vp; the other place noting the time,
viz. after his death. Now this is the force
of this argument: Christ bringeth men
to beleeue in him, therefore euery mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the visible church is holie. I neede
not stay in shewing how well this proofe
is made; we wil come to the last place for
this matter cited, which is that of Christ,
Luk. 17. 3. <hi>Looke to your selues,</hi> and so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
in shewing how reprehensions
are to be vsed; I cannot perceiue what
moued the Author to alledge this place
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:244:14"/>
which pertaineth not to the matter; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it were to make a shew in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
amongst his other friuolous &amp; vain
quotacions. To proceede, <hi>This faithfull
and holy people is gathered in the name of
Christ Iesus, their onely king, priest, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
&amp;c.</hi> That Christ Iesus is our onely
king, priest, and prophet, and that the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
of God in all their assemblies, both
publike and priuate, do meete in his
name, is confessed: but the manner of
dealing with the scripture, is not here
greatly to be commended. For how is
the kingdome of Christ prooued? for it
is cited, Gen. 44. and the tenth verse,
where Ioseph speaking to his brethren
of the cuppe, saith thus. <hi>Now then, let it
be according to your words, he with whom
it is found shall be my seruant, and yee shall
be blamelesse.</hi> Truely, if a written coppie
of this treatise, being more ancient then
the printed booke had not come vnto
my handes, wherein I see the same place
quoted, I should haue laide this fault
vppon the Printer, for I should neuer
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:244:15"/>
haue suspected a church builder to haue
bene such a sencelesse prophaner of the
word of God. The other testimonies, viz.
Psal. 45. 6. Zac. 9. 9. Heb. 1. 8. are more
plaine. So for his priesthood, the making
intercession for his, Rom. 8. 34. &amp; Ioh. 17.
which is a part of that function; and Heb.
5. 9. &amp; 8. 1. &amp; 4. 14. speaking of the whole
office, are to be accepted. Now to come
to his propheticall function, for which is
alledged Deut. 18. 15. which is not to be
restrained vnto Christ; for it promiseth
vnto the church a continuall succession
of teachers in all ages. It is more to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
which is alledged out of Matth. 17.
5. &amp; Heb. 1. 1. but as touching Gen. 14.
18. though it speaketh of Melchisedek,
who was king of Salem, and a Priest, and
was a figure of Christ, Heb. 7. 1. yet the
place that is quoted hath small force in
it selfe, to proue that, for the which it is
brought.<note place="margin">In his pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst read prayers, and Treatise of the church apparant.</note>
               </p>
               <p>This church <hi>also worshippeth him aright;</hi>
that is, neither in a <hi>set forme</hi> of praier, nor
yet in that place where discipline is not
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:244:15"/>
established; for we gather the Authors
minde out of his owne writings. So
that he alloweth that for true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
which is by the direction of Gods
spirit, our onely helpe, and vnder the
established gouernement of Pastors,
&amp;c. Indeed,<note place="margin">Iohn. 4.</note> God is a spirite, and is to be
worshipped in spirite and truth, which
cannot be done without his direction:
yet are there certaine outward helpes
which God hath sanctified for the furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of the weake, in their special seruing
of God, as reading, &amp;c. And if true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
cannot be performed without this
gouernment, then may not we iustifie, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
their owne seruing of God, for they
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues do want this discipline. Three
places of scripture are here abused,<note place="margin">Exod. 20. 7. Leuit. 10. 5.</note> Exo.
20. 7. 8. Leuit. 10. 5. Ioh. 4. 23. for not one of
them condemneth read prayers in any
ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, much lesse whol churches, either for
them, or for want of this discipline. True
it is, that the name of God must not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused,
neither must his worship be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned,
as is euident to be seene in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dab
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:244:16"/>
and Abihu, who for their strange fire
were consumed of the Lord; not that he
regardeth so much a cole of fire, only he
warneth men to take heede, that they
worship God according to his owne ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment.
But to the matter. Did the sin
of Nadab and Abihu cause Moses &amp; his
people to be no church vnto God? we
may not so thinke. The offenders recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
iust recompence for their sin, the rest
continued the seruants &amp; worshippers of
God. These proofs therfore faile in these
points: First they proue not that the false
worship of one maketh a nullity before
God of the whole co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregation, but shew
the contrarie; secondly, they proue not a
set forme of praier to be a taking of Gods
name in vaine, a prophanation of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baoth,
or a carnal worship: but we say that
this kind of worship is vnlike to that of
Nadab &amp; Abihu, because it is warranted
in the word of God, wherin I wil not vrge
Nu. 6. 23. or Matth. 6. 9. which hauing bin
aledged heretofore, are turned aside with
expounding the Hebrue <hi>coh,</hi> &amp; the greek
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:244:16"/>
                  <hi>houtos,</hi> after this manner, or thus: as if the
place in Numery were the sum of al bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings,
&amp; the other in Matth. were only gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
for a direction in our praiers; the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of which cauil, togither with the whole
discourse hereof, I leaue to him who hath
alredy dealt with this matter: &amp; yet in the
meane season, we may note that the 102.
Ps. was not giuen for a patterne of prayer,
but to be vsed for a prayer, as appeareth
by the title therof. <hi>Tepillah legnanei kiiagne
toph beliphne Iehouah jishpek shicho.</hi> A praier
for the poore when he is distressed, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
out his meditation before the Lord.
Also Psa. 9. <hi>Mizmor shir leiom hashabath;</hi>
A Psalme &amp; song for the sabaoth day. So
that as the former was a set praier for the
afflicted, so this latter was a thanksgiuing
for the blessings of God, &amp; both of them
vsed in his holy worship. Of the like sort
are Psal. 42. 44. 22. 80. 39. and many other
Psalmes which were not helpes onely to
meditation, but set praiers in the church
of God. Thirdly, these places proue not
the want of this discipline to make a false
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:244:17"/>
worship, but we say that God cannot be
truly serued, where the discipline descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
in this treatise is established, which
shall appeare by that which followeth.
<hi>Being peaceably gouerned by his officers and
lawes.</hi> The Author expresseth what his
meaning is, in the other part of this
booke: for he describeth these officers
and these lawes, what they are: Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
all which, this I say in generall, that
here is nothing but palpable ignorance
to be found, for first these gouerning of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,<note place="margin">Officers.</note>
pastors, doctors, Elders, Deacons
and relieuers, being fiue in number, are
so necessarily required, that the want of
these or any of these in a congregation,
causeth it to be no Church apparant. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the which assertion, for to make
their madnes more manifest, we do here
by the way of supposition grant vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
that there are such functions, &amp; yet these
exceptions may be taken: first, if the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
hath described the relieuer and the
Deacon faithfully, then are they no go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerning
officers, but seruants vnto the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:244:17"/>
church. Secondly, that the want of Elders
taketh not away the <hi>esse</hi> or being of the
church, considering that Christ and his
disciples which ioined with him were the
apparant church, and yet during the time
of his humiliation these officers were not
erected. And when many reuolted, as is
to be seene Iohn. 6. Christ asking the
twelue if they also would go away, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
answered in the name of the rest, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
to whom shall we go, thou hast the words
of eternal life?</hi> so that Peter accounteth the
word a sufficient warrant for his continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with Christ, howsoeuer these men
though they confesse that the worde
of God is to be heard, yet denie the
hearing of it at their mouthes, which
haue not ordained Elders among them.
But this may seeme no sufficient proofe,
which is taken from Christ and his disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
forasmuch as this discipline was not
then commanded, I answere, that if there
were a time when the church of Christ
was without this gouernment, and foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as it receiued not the gouernment
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:244:18"/>
of the Iewes, it is not a perpetuall rule,
that outward gouernment should be the
life of the Church, but I will not holde
them in this straight: they aske where we
can finde a church without this gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
after that Christ had sent his spirite
vpon the disciples. I answere, that as Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothie
was left at Ephesus, so was Titus
in Crete, I meane <hi>in the house of God, which
is the church of the liuing God.</hi> And yet at
that time Elders were not appointed in
that church before Titus had ordained
them, not to speake of the church of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,
which made choise of Deacons,
but not of Elders. Also it is plaine that
the Elders which were appointed in the
churches by the Apostles, were for the
most part such as dealt in the worde, and
not in gouerment onely, as heereafter
shall be made more manifest in his due
place. Thirdly, that the Doctor is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
in euery congregation, nor yet to
execute his office in the publike assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies.
For wheras they themselues affirme
that the word &amp; sacramentes must go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:244:18"/>
for which they alledge that saying
of Christ,<note place="margin">Math. 28. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>Go preach, haptising:</hi> by which say<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing
wee are drawen to the mislike of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preaching
ministers: so by the same wee
may conclude against an vnministering
Doctorship, the worde and Sacraments,
the mysteries of God are not to be diuor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
yet do we acknowledge the office of
a Doctor, a distinct matter fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the pastors
function, who is to feed his sheep with the
mysteries of God, both worde and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in the asse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>blies, which are for Gods
worship; the Doctor attending vpon his
dutie in a place by the church appointed,
instructing men in the true sense of the
scriptures, whereby the church may haue
able men alwaies in readines, to supplie
such romes as shalbee void in the church
by death or otherwise, <hi>Pastor in ecclesijs,
Doctor in scholis.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In annota. Bez. Eph. 4.</note> Lastly, I saie, that though
it were gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, that this platform drawen
out in this treatise, were warranted by the
word, yet ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not they ascribe to it an abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to make the church of God perfect
therby in this life, for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shuld that praier
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:244:19"/>
be needlesse,<note place="margin">Matth. 6. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>forgiue vs our sinnes.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will they say, that these offices can
at al times be had, especially when there
are not men sufficiently qualified for
them: for they confesse that Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
are not to be prophaned, and to
haue no Elders is better then to haue
ignorant and insufficient Elders, and in
this respect do they cleare the church in
the dayes of Christs humiliation, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit
it from sinne in the want of this esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
gouernement; nor yet will they
grant, that if there were men meete for
these offices, that yet they should be set
in these roomes before the church doth
elect them,<note place="margin">In this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise.</note> 
                  <hi>for here is no intrusion, &amp;c.</hi> So
that the most that by their owne doctrine
is to be yeelded vnto, is this; that when
men are able, in respect of their gifts, to
vndertake this burthen, if it be thought a
matter expedient by euery member of
the church, then is this gouernement ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,<note place="margin">In the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of the apparant church</note>
but this is farre wide from that
conclusion which is made against the
church of England, that it should not be a
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:244:19"/>
church, bicause it did not receiue this go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement.
I omit to speake any further
of the particular offices, vntil we come to
the seuerall handling of them. And as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the lawes which here are required,
either they are not at all described in this
booke, which were grosse, or else we must
confesse that the lawes of Christ are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect,
which is impious. For the lawes
that in the end of this boke are set down,
are such as may seeme to be sufficient for
the ordering of the common sort, but if
the Elder be disordered, here is no lawe
for his reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or if the whole seigno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
do faile either in iudgement or in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
(as generall councels, much
more a priuat eldership may feele their
wants) there is no manner of proceeding
declared in this euill. VVell the church
of Christ must be guided by his <hi>officers
and lawes.</hi> How is this proued? Heere is
alleaged Matth. 11. 29. where Christ wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
vs to take his yoke on vs. Mark. 13.
34. where is shewed that he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to euerie man his worke: in both
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:244:20"/>
these, he speaketh not of discipline, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he willeth men in all meeknes to walke
in their callings. VVhereunto is fitly ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
that of Paul, 1. Cor. 11. 16. If any man
lust to be <hi>contentious, we haue no such custom
nor the churches of God.</hi> And I wish with all
my heart that he which quoted these pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
had the grace to practise that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
which in them is contained. That
of Iohn, Reue. 22. 9. where the Angel doth
forbid Iohn to worship him. I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
my ignorance in not conceiuing
how it is applied to the matter in hande,
<hi>Keeping the dutie of faith.</hi> This keeping of
faith in the bond of peace &amp; loue, beeing
required in the foresaide officers (as the
wordes seeme to import) cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
by the places of Scripture, which
are cited for that purpose, Eph. 4. 3. 1. Cor.
1. 13. Mark. 9. 50. Iohn. 13. 34. 1. Cor. 13. 4.
1. Pet. 1. 22. 1. Iohn. 3. 18. for all these (one
of them onely excepted, viz. 1. Co. 13. 4.
which describeth the properties of loue)
are generall exhortations vnto all men,
not particular to these officers, to keep
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:244:20"/>
the vnitie of the spirit in the bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of peace

Math. 3. 2. quoted, where the kingdome
of God is mentioned, not for the visible
Church, but for that happinesse which is
assured in newnesse of life. In which sense
that of Christ is to be vnderstood Iohn.
3. 3. whereas the Church is called the
body of Christ. Ephes. 1. 23. It is not
meant by the visible, but the vniuersall
church of God. Thus vnder hope to get
credit by folding vp a multitude of scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
in a narrowe roome, ignorance
hath vnfolded and laide it selfe open to
the broad world. But why are these ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
of the church broght into this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise?
Surely that from the excellencie of
them might be enforced a perfection. But
who knoweth not wherefore these titles
were giuen, and those promises were
made vnto the Church, viz. that it and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
member there of might bee assured
of Gods loue, whereby they might bee
comforted in the middest of the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of men, knowing that the temporal

dealings wherevnto they are
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:244:22"/>
subiect, shall not be able to ouerwhelme
them seeing they are so precious in the
eies of God. Also that the remebrance of
this excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy, might stir the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp to looke
vnto their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uersation, that as God hath

               <p>And surely if this Church be considered in

               <p>Here is a third matter set down to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
the church vnto vs,<note place="margin">Answere.</note> viz. the glorie,
excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy &amp; sincerity of euery part therof
being seuerally considered. VVhich mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
if it could be as soundly proued, as it
is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidently spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were this church
in itself without Christ most beutiful, yea
most wonderfull, and euen rauishing the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:244:23"/>
senses to conceiue, much more to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde:
what then to enioy so blessed a
communion? But to begin withall, the
place of Salomon,<note place="margin">Cant. 5.</note> Can. 6. 4. 9. is much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused
by the author, whilest that it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the beutie of the church,
which is nothing else but blacknesse, as
the church her selfe acknowledgeth. For
wheras in the former chapter the church
hath accused her selfe of negligence, in
not perfourming her dueties vnto her
spouse. And (the daughters of Ierusalem
comforting her) she declared his nature
and disposition, the place of his abode,
&amp;c. whereby shee doeth aggreuate her
former fault. For <hi>(quem beneficia accepta
meliorem non reddunt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chrisost. de sacerd. li. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>is certe etiam grauius
suppliuum commeretur.</hi> Hee whome bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites
receiued make not better, doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
the more grieuous punishment.
And surely the greater the loue of Christ
is to the church, the greater is the sinne
of the church in not performing dutie.)
Novv in the former parte of this sixth
chapter, her beloued doth comfort her,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:244:23"/>
&amp; doth assure hir that she is as dere vnto
him novv, as euer before she had beene.
So then it is not the excellencie of the
church that commendeth her, but her
spouse through his gracious fauor doth
accept of her, notvvithstanding her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
which she acknowledgeth.<note place="margin">The seueral parts of the church.</note> To let
this passe, let vs consider the seuerall
parts of this visible church.<note place="margin">Her king.</note> 
                  <hi>Her King and
Lord is the king of peace, and Lord himself of al
glory,</hi> the sauior of Sion. Esa. 62. 11. a king,
Iohn. 12. 15. and one, whose soueraigntie
was figured in Melchizedek, Heb. 7. 8.
So that in regard of this hir king, we also
do confesse the church to be glorious;
<hi>She enioyeth most holy and heauenly lawes.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Her lawes.</note>
Most true it is, that the commandements
of Christ are such, that it cannot iustly
be counted a seruitude to be obedient
vnto them; yrksome they are no doubt
to a carnall man, but not to him that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
God: this is it that is witnessed in
the places alledged, viz. Matt. 11. 30. and
1. Iohn. 5. 3. but what are these Lawes and
commandements? <hi>Our Sauiour Christ,</hi> say
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:244:24"/>
they, <hi>was fortie daies after his resurrection
conuersant with his Apostles, teaching them
those things which concerne the building of the
church and kingdome, and the Apostles accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as they haue receiued instruction of him,
so they builded, and lefte vs a patterne nowe.</hi>
So that these most holie lawes were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
by Christ to his Apostles, betvveene
the times of his resurrection and ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>VVhereunto I saie, that although
the discipline of Christ beeing his owne
ordinance is most holy, yet this is to put
it in the number of vnwritten verities,
when men would proue it by such argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
as this is. And as for the saying
of Christ by them produced, it doth not
speake of discipline, for hee onelie wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
his Disciples to take his yoake vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them.</p>
               <p>I knowe that they take this <hi>Yoake
for discipline,</hi> but the circumstaunces of
the place do bewraie their ignorance in
so thinking. For in bearing this yoake,
CHRIST willeth that his example
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:244:24"/>
bee followed, <hi>Learne of me,</hi> saith Christ.
Nowe I woulde vnderstande of these
men, what was that Church, wherein
Christ founde this discipline established,
and submitted himselfe vnto the same,
leauing this his deede for an example to
bee followed: if they cannot tel me this,
as it is harde to shewe that which neuer
was, I wonder what hath moued them to
wring out discipline from hence, seeing
that Christ onely exhorteth to submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
meeknes, &amp;c. by his example. The
Philosopher was not so grosse in his
<hi>Panspermia,</hi> as they are in making <hi>quidli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet
ex quolibet</hi> so commonly. Yet I saie
againe, the lawes of Christ are most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and that discipline which he appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
most necessarie, which is not the
gouernment which heere is decyphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
for it shall appeare to bee the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
of man, without the approbation
of the vvord of God, but the rule of his
worde, wherein vvee are taught to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploie
our selues in our seuerall callings,
to performe those dueties which in our
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:244:25"/>
callings God requireth at our handes.
As for the vigilancie of Pastors,<note place="margin">Her mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</note> the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie
of Doctors, the carefulnesse of
Gouernors, the trustinesse of those vnto
whom the care of the poore is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
the sobrietie of relieuers, the humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
obedience and meekenesse of the
people; these are required in the word of
God, and all the testimonies in this cause
cited (one or two excepted) are admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
&amp; exhortations, that men wold be
carefull of these things, as they do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
them in their callings. But do these
proofes here vsed iustifie that the visible
church enioyeth such a people, qualified
in this sort? Nay, those that come nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
the matter, as Rom. 12. 7. 8. Act. 20.
28. Matth. 5. 5. Deut. 18. 10. are but exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
vnto this fidelitie, vigilancy, &amp;c.
but no promises that the church shal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy
such men alwayes.<note place="margin">Bulling. &amp; Ioh. Bale in Act. 2. Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus contra valent. li. 1. cap. 27. Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tul. in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrip. Heret.</note> Some of these
scriptures do flatly shew the contrarie.
Read Act. 20. vers. 29. 30. <hi>I know,</hi> saith
Paul, <hi>there shall enter in among you grieuous
wolues, not sparing the flocke, &amp;c.</hi> It is also
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:244:25"/>
the iudgement of some, that one of the
deacons spoken of Act. 6. was the first of
the Nicholaitans mentioned Reuel. 2. 6.
Other places alleaged are nothing to the
purpose as Ioh. 13. 7. which is not spoken
of the widowes, that here are called rele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers,
but to the disciples of their duties in
helping one an other. Likewise Esay. 60.
which is a prophesie of the calling of the
Gentiles, and &amp; Eze. 36. 38. which promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
a blessing vpon Israell, are farre from
prouing that euerie member of the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
church is meeke, obedient, &amp;c. thus
hath our author tolde vs of many good
things, without due proofe of any one.</p>
               <p>VVhen this describer of the church,
had shewed vs the sinceritie of euerie
member particularly, he giueth his iudge
ment of them all iointly, saying: <hi>Euerie
stone is liuing elect &amp; pretious,</hi> which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
with three testimonies: the first is,
1. Reg. 7. 9. where the building of Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
being shewed in order, that he built
one house to dwell in, an other called the
forrest of Libanon, a porch for the throne
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:244:26"/>
where he iudged, and a house also for
Pharaos daughter, it is said, <hi>All these were
of costlie stones.</hi> And how then? did euerie
of these buildinges to what vse soeuer
they were appointed, represent the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
church of God? The onely sight of
this place is sufficient to shew what force
it hath to prooue the matter in question.
The second place is Zach. 14. 21. <hi>Euerie pot
in Ierusalem and Iuda shall be holie vnto the
Lord of hostes, and all they that sacrfice shall
come, and take of them, and seeth therein:</hi> by
this ceremonie the people were put in
minde, that euerie of them doe worship
the Lorde with holy affections, but this
doeth not prooue that all the people did
thus behaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues in Gods worship;
the contrary is plaine. Agg. 2. 11. 12. &amp;c.
The last place which is 1. Pet. 2. 5. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth
more neere the marke: for the Apostle
saith that as liuely stones they were made
a spirituall house; yet he saith not that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
one among them was so, and those
that were, he declareth from whence it
came: to wit, Iesus Christ. In which mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:244:26"/>
(if no further purity be ment by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor)
we do agree: as also that euerie one
hath his burthen &amp; his order, being bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
to edifie one an other, exhort, reproue,
and comfort one an other louingly as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
members of one bodie, and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as in Gods sight. The neglect of these
duties hath bred, nourished, &amp; continued
this late &amp; pestilent schisme amongst vs.</p>
               <p>That the affecting of offices, the wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
or neglecting of laws, &amp; peruerting
of truth are not incident to the church, is
newes too good to be true, as shal appere
euen by the selfe same places of scripture
which here are set in the margent as good
proofes of the authors follies, whiles that
they do so flatly gainesay that which they
should iustifie. <hi>For manie make merchandize
of the word.</hi> 2. Cor. 2. 17. And <hi>Diotrephes lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
to haue the preheminence</hi> 3. Iohn. 9. then
is there affecting of offices. <hi>In the latter
times some shall speake lies through hipocrisie,
and haue their consciences burned with an
hot iron</hi> 1. Timoth. 4. 2. And <hi>some desiring to
make a faire shew in the flesh constraine men
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:244:27"/>
to be circumcised</hi> Galat. 6. 12. then is there
peruerting of trueth. The Corinthians
were negligent in proceeding against the
incestuous person 1. Cor. 5. then is there
neglecting of lawes. VVhat shall we then
say to this man, who woulde make the
world beleue, that the scriptures do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
that, which they do so directly and
plainely deny? Let him pronounce the
sentence vpon him selfe. He saith, <hi>The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
that hath a dreame let him tell a dreame,
and he that hath Gods word let him speake
Gods word faithfully.</hi> Ier. 23. 28. and so say
I: for it is a vile abuse, that is offered to
God and man, when a dreame or fancie
is countenaunced with the scriptures,
which doe ouerthrow it. <hi>What is the chaffe
to the wheat. Timothie durst not thus behaue
himselfe in Gods house 1. timoth. 3. 15. Euerie
member of the church</hi> (say they) <hi>ought to haue
freedome to vtter his complaintes and griefes,
yea and not disturbing the peaceable order of
the church</hi> (by passing the boundes of his
calling) <hi>to reproue transgressions and errors:</hi>
this we grant of our owne accord, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:244:27"/>
vrged hereunto by any thing menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned.
1. Corinth. 6. or 14. 30. which proue
it not; but that the estate of the visible
church is such, that euerie member hath
alwaies this freedome, we deny it. Also,
we say, that as there may be intrusion or
climing vp an other way into the sheepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
through mens corruptions, then by
the election of those to whome election
doth belong: so woulde it be a horrible
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fusion if the election of offices were left
in the hands of the people, as in this plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
of discipline they doe teach vs, but
that the people should haue their interest
in ordination, also is more then grosse.
For proofe whereof, I will not stand vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
those places of Paule 1. Tim. 5. 22. <hi>lay
not thy hand rashlie on anie man,</hi> and Tit 15.
<hi>for this cause left I thee at Creete, that thou
mightest appoint Elders in euerie citie,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that although they flatly gainesay
the ordination of Elders by the people;
yet they seeme not sufficient vnto some,
to infringe the libertie of the people in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
also;<note place="margin">Caluin Inst. lib. 4. cap. 3 Sect. 15.</note> because that Luke shewing
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:244:28"/>
howe Paule and Barnabas appointed El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditioned,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:244:28"/>
or void of grauity (as generally
the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon sort are fautie in one of these)
then ought other pastors to rule, yea and
ouerrule the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Those churches also which
by the iudgement of our author himselfe
are most reformed, who admit not any

state of the church, they haue the same di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposed
by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon counsel of the Elder
ship, so that election is in their power, the
people consenting vnto them. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
(not to presse the authority of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom,

500. saith flatly that neither people nor
Elders were to elect a bishop,<note place="margin">Chrisost. in Phil. hom. 2.</note> or a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
but the bishop only) neither election,
much lesse ordination ought to be at any
time in the hands of the multitude, furder
then in giuing cosent vnto the pastors,
nor at all to be regarded if they be such
as before haue bin mentioned; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as these men are vaine in arroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

for that it leaueth not this election vnto

Indeede when Corah and his companie
had gathered them selues togither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Moses and Aaron, they said, <hi>Ye
take too much vpon you seeing all the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
is holie euerie one of them and the Lord
is among them.</hi> But I doubt I should iniurie
Corah by comparing these men vnto
him; for he vnder the pretense of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and freedome, sought onely to be
priuiledged from submission; but these
our men vnder the same vaile, content
not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues herewith, but in their aspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
minds do seeke to bring not the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement
of the church onely, but of
the weale publike also into their handes;
for obtaining where of they lay this plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme:
first that priuatmen are to erect
and establish this gouernment of theirs,
and then it being erected that all matters
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:244:29"/>
both ciuill and ecclesiastical are to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
by the same. The later of these two
pointes wil be manifest hereafter in their
description of an Elder, who (as they say)
must discerne betweene plea and plea,
&amp;c. And as touching the former point, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
in one of their writings which
they haue dispersed they haue made this
protestatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; <hi>We purpose not to medle with the
reformation of the state, otherwise then by our
prayers vnto God;</hi> yet as forgetting them
selues, immediately after in the same dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
they affirme, that <hi>Christ hath left
but one forme of gouernement in his last will
and Testament vnto his church, which he hath
sealed with his bloud: and therefore not left it
arbitrable at the plesures of princes, or policies
of times to be done or vndone, but made it by a
double right inuiolable, both by his vvord and
his Testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t:</hi> so that the church of God can
neither be gouerned by any other lawes
or gouernement, neither ought it to be
without this; for God holdeth them all in
the state of enemies, which haue not his
sonne to raigne ouer them. Now then the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:244:30"/>
faithfull are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to gather togither
in Christs name, with promise of directio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
&amp; protection, &amp; authoritie not only to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish
his lawes &amp; ordinances amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
but faithfully to gouern his church ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by;
for the kingdom of God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sisteth not
in word but in power. Now this assembly
of the faithfull before they be planted &amp;
established in this order, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sisteth hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
but of priuate persons, none as yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
called vnto office, &amp; function. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we may well conclude that God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth
his faithful seruants being as yet
priuat men, togither to build his church,
according to the true patterne of Christs
Testament: thus farre they. But here is no
word of God to proue any of these asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
we read of <hi>Asa, Iehosaphat, Iehoiada</hi>
the priest, <hi>Hezekia, Iosia</hi> &amp; others, some of
them pulling downe the abominations of
Iuda, others setting vp the priests &amp; Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uits
in their places in the house of God di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sposing
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as in the feere of God, semed
good in their eies; but in the whole book
of God is not to be found either precept
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:244:30"/>
or exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple to warrant a priuat man in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,
much lesse in erecting the church of
God. <hi>Who then required these things at the
hands of these men?</hi> will they tell vs of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
procedings in matters of extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity?
Let them shew herein some extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
testimony from God to warrant
vs in regarding them, otherwise here is in
trusion. For howsoeuer Zerubbabel &amp; Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hosuah,
Ezra &amp; Nehemia did daily pray
for the restoring of the people out of cap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiuity,
&amp; were most willing &amp; ready to go

these were no common persons,<note place="margin">Neh. 1. 4. &amp; 2. 5.</note> Iehosua
being the high priest, Zerubbabel a chief
ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the people, Ezra a scribe of the law,
&amp; Nehemia a great man, yea in the court

               <p>In this descriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the pastors office,
as the author hath set down some things
therein required, so hath he lefte other
matters pertaining (by his own doctrine)
thereunto, altogether vntouched: for
whereas he telleth vs of an Eldershippe,
wherein the pastor is the chiefe, here is
nothing mentioned of this matter, as if
the ecclesiasticall censure remained as
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:244:32"/>
peculiar vnto the Elders. Againe, foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as he requireth in a pastor, that hee
exhort, rebuke, and conuince the gayne-sayers
of wholesome doctrine: hee doth
confirme herein that which hath ben said
concerning the Doctor, for either this
functio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is not in the publik place of Gods
worship, or else it doeth intrude into the
pastorall charge, &amp; so these offices would
not be seuered and diuerse. Thirdly, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
modestie, humilitie, meeknes, &amp;c. are
necessarie in a Pastor, Doctor, Elder, aud
all, we seee howe vnfitte these men are to
beare anie office in the Church of God,
considering how farre they are from mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destie,

not <hi>so fit</hi> as might bee to proue the office

               <p>In this description of a doctor here
is nothing differing from that which hath
bin in the description of a pastor. For as
there, no me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion was made of any eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
iurisdiction, so here it is also pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
ouer in silence, as if he had neuer said
that the pastor and doctor were gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
officers. And as there he requireth
of a pastor the diuiding of the worde of
God aright, and the approuing of it to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
mans conscience, so doth he heere
require the same in a doctor: and both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
in the iudgement of our author are
to execute their office without any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
either of the place or of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or of the manner of dealing, then the
which what can be more fond, if he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
the truth in saying that <hi>these offices
are limited, seuered and diuers.</hi> And lastlie,
as in the description of a pastor, the scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
were abused, so in this of a doctor
they are not friendly handled. For these-places,
1. Tim. 3. Tit. 1. &amp; 2. Tim. 2. 15. haue
bene alleaged before for the pastor, who
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:244:33"/>
being an ouerseer of Christs flocke, hath
not bene denied the vse of the Scriptures
to decypher out his calling, but in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the same in again for a Doctor, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
that the store is now spent, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
there was no spare in the beginning of
this Treatise. Also these 1. Cor. 1. 17. &amp;

Caluine reporteth,<note place="margin">Cal. Inst. lib 4. cap. 4. se. 1</note> that in churches

in the Scriptures ascribed vnto

eos omnino fuisse presbyteros, quos E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopos.</hi>
VVith those of ancient times the
same men were Elders which were Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.
Therfore it is not so directly from
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:244:34"/>
the word of God, (as in the title of this
booke is promised) but from the practise
of some churches that he hath taken this
name Elder, to giue it vnto those which
beare office without anie further dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in the ministerie of the word. As the
name Elder in this place is not vsuall in
the word, so the office of an Elder, as it is
here described, hath neither warrant of
the worde, nor yet of any church, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ancient or of latter daies. I graunt
that certain churches haue made choice
of men which shoulde deale onely in the
censures of the church, whom they haue
called <hi>Presbyteros,</hi> Elders. But the most
that they haue euer required in such an
Elder was, that he should be sound in
faith, in life vnreproueable, able to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scerne
of the dealings of euerie calling in
the church, careful to see rightly into the
same, and readie to ioyne in correcting
with ecclesiastical censure, those that are
vndutifull, beeing helpfull vnto the rest.
But that it shoulde belong vnto them to
discerne betweene cause and cause, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:244:35"/>
plea and plea, &amp;c. It is a plaine
pulling of the svvorde out of the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
hand. They meane no such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
(they saie) for they graunt the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
his authoritie ouer the persons,
though not ouer the causes of men. This
it is, whereas her Maiesty hath appointed
Iudges in the land to end causes, decide
controuersies, &amp; to giue sentence vpon
malefactors, and shirifes to see the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of that vvhich the Iudges haue
determined: the seat of iudgement must
be brought into the consistorie of these
Elders, and the office of the Shirife must
be onely lefte in the hande of the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
to see the decrees of these aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients
put in execution. Now tell mee
if these men do not goe beyond Corah
&amp; his companie,<note place="margin">Num. 26. 3.</note> as before vvas said? yet
I will leaue the further consideration
of these matters vnto those whom they
doe concerne, onely let vs see vvhat
warrants they haue out of the worde
of God for the largenesse of this their
commission. Num. 11. 24. maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:244:35"/>
of three score and tenne men which
were chosen by the appointment of God
to bee assistants vnto Moses, but these
were temporall magistrates, and not ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall.
Againe, it sayth not that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
was discharged, and the authoritie of
iudging betweene plea and plea, remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the power of these men onely. As
like to purpose is Act. 15. where there is
neither anie such authoritie mentioned
as aforesayd, nor yet such an office as an
vnministering Elder spoken of. For the
worde Elders in that place, doeth signifie
those that labour in vvord and doctrine,
as hath beene noted before. As touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that of Paul, 1. Tim. 5. 17. <hi>An Elder
is worthie of double honour, especially such as
labour in the worde and doctrine.</hi> From
whence is collected that there were
some Elders, which did not labour in the
word and doctrine. I answere, that there
was a time (as before was saide) when
such Elders were in the church, but when
they had their beginning, how long they
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued, &amp; how far their office exte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded:
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:244:36"/>
The author hath neither in this place nor
els where shewed. At the first they were
not, as by that hath bene shewed may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.
Afterward it should seeme that
some such were appointed for the secret
meetings of the faithful, whiles they were
vnder persecution, but when the church
increased and was dispersed into nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as now it is in England, we reade not
that such were continued in the Church,
nay the contrarie is flatly testified. For
as Ierome sayeth, <hi>Idem est Presbyter qui
est Episcopus: &amp; antequam diaboli instinctu,

should be set in the place of the rest,
to whome might pertaine the whole
state of the Church. If there be any help,
it must be had from the 2. Chro. 19. 8. for
there it is thus writen. <hi>Moreouer in Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem
Iehosaphat did appoint of the Leuites &amp;

the chiefe of the families of Israell. This

and plea, betweene plague and plague in the
matters of controuersie within thy gates, thou
shalt then arise and go vp vnto the place which
Iehoua thy God shall choose; and thou shalt
come vnto the priestes of the Leuites, or vnto
the iudge that shall be in those daies, &amp;c.</hi> So
that this disiunctiue (or) doth expresse a
plaine difference betweene the office of
the priest, and the matters belonging to
the iudge. For althogh <hi>ve al hashpat</hi> be red
in some translations <hi>&amp; to the iudge,</hi> yet the
twelft verse of this chapter doth end this
controuersie, where the disiunctiue (or) is
set downe by an other worde; <hi>That man
that wil do presumptuously not harkning vnto
the priest (that sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth before the Lord thy God
to minister there) o al hashpat, or to the iudge
shall dye.</hi> For it is euident that bloud-shed
pertained to the iudge, the descrying of
plagues vnto the priest. Likewise conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
being about diuerse matters, those
that concerned ciuil affaires pertained to
the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall iudge, other matters of faith,
were to be decided by the ecclesiasticall

a seignorie, yet all causes are not to bee
brought into their consistorie. In the
meane time we see that these men being
at defiance with popery, haue here shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
vs a reason of it, because the both of
them would iudge all, and would be iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by none, both wold priuiledge their

in the Papist, so in these we may see, a sot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish

for as touching Deacons, it is generallie

the primitiue Church, such as our author
doth here speake of. One saith, that <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteri,

Christi,</hi> Elders, Bishops and deacons, that
is to saie, the ministers of Christ: were
names giuen generally to those that had

Athanasius expoundeth that of

               <p>Therefore although master Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine

                  <note place="margin">Cal. Inst. lib. 4. cap. 4. sect. 5.</note> Deacons
shoulde vnder the Bishoppes be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiders
for the poore. Yet seeing
they dealte in other matters also, and
were called <hi>Diaconi,</hi> because they were
ministers of the worde also; our author
should haue shewed vs when it was that
these Deacons ceased to deale in other
matters then in prouision for the poore
onely, or else hee shoulde haue tolde vs
that there are two sortes of Deacons,
<hi>Diaconoi tou logou,</hi> minister of the vvord,
and ministers or disposers of the goods
of the poore. And these thinges hee
must haue prooued by Gods worde,
and then in this pointe hee had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmed
his promise made in the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of his booke, and shevved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to be so good as his owne worde,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:244:39"/>
but nowe by what authoritie hee hath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
by the same authority may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
such an office as is here spoken of, to
be that Deacon which is me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned in the
places cited. Act. 6. For Philip who was
one of the Deacons, did both teach and
baptize, Act. 8. which matter although we
should graunt that he did it, not as a dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,
but being an Euangelist, as some
with this distinction would shifte off the
matter, yet must it bee confessed, that the
Deacons mentioned in the Actes, were
not discharged from dealing in the word,
onely to take vpon them the care of the
poore. Neither doeth Paul 1. Tit. 3. 8.
speake anie thing to gainesaie this. Yet
I grant that in the Church of God a care
of the poore must bee had, and that there
be faithfull men appointed for the same,
of whom the Apostle speaketh, Rom. 12.
8. which place cannot bee referred vnto
the liberalitie of al Christians in general,
as some haue taught. For this is handled
in the thirtenth verse of the same chapter,
which shoulde haue beene done if there
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:244:39"/>
were not a difference betweene the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
required in the eight verse, which spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
of the publike officer, and the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth

all Christians: for vaine repetitions are
not vsed by the Apostle. But to go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:244:40"/>
so that they may more truly be called the

were the church possessed of such, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall
able to maintaine both them and
these whome they were to attend vpon,
then would it be a great comfort to them
all. I spare to speake further of these, only
it may be obserued that the place cited to
proue such an office in the church, 1. Tim.

indeed, that is, which haue nede of

they are which especially are to haue the
relief of the church, vz. such as by reson of
their age and want of frends are not able
to help themselues, althogh in a godly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:244:40"/>
they hate idlenesse: but as for the
yonger widdowes they are not to liue by
the maintenance of the church, least that
idlenesse be maintained, the mouthes of
the enemies be opened against the truth
&amp; the church be abused, whiles the goods
of the church be spent vppon those who
make protestation, that they haue no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
comfort (for to such only is the relief
of the church to be giuen) &amp; yet through
the lust of youth do betake themselues to
mariage again; which thogh it be a matter
lawfull in it self, yet is it vnlawful to those
that before God &amp; his church haue vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the contrary: and thus is this place ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
by Theophilact, Ambrose, Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linger,
Claudius Guilliaud and others.
Thus haue we at the last the offices &amp; of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
of a reformed church described, so
wel as our autor could, of whom togither
with his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plices we may truly say (as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drianus
spake on his death bed of his phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions,
that they brought him to his end)
these reformers in their platforme here
prescribed haue offred vs such a medicin
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:244:41"/>
that if the Church shoulde bee voide of
sense and receiue it, shee might in short
time complaine, that these her Phisitions
had brought her to her end: yet we must
beleeue vpon paine of damnation, that it
is a good receit: wherein they deale like
vnskilful and vnconscionable Phisitions,
who promise a wonderfull cure, <hi>rauishing
the senses to conceiue, much more to beholde,
what then to inioy so blessed a comfort?</hi> and
yet will minister that which will bee the
bane of the patient. Christ indeede hath
shewed an outwarde gouernment vnto
his church, whereof although we are not
capable, partly by reason of mens insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie
to order it, &amp; partly by meanes of
the crookednes of the common sort, who
will not abide to be ordered by it, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
for that a whole nation cannot
so easily be brought to that vniforme or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
as some one priuate congregation,
yet assuredly the neerer we come to this
his ordinance, the more heauenly is that
harmonie and consent of ours. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I will not staie in shewing how the laws
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:244:41"/>
of our Church of Englande haue proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that in the congregations we should
haue Pastors: In the Vniuersities such as
execute the office of doctors in bringing
vp those in the knoledge of Gods word,
which may supplie the places that are
void of teachers in the Churches: &amp; in all
places, some to obserue the behauiors of
men, others to collect the reliefe of the
poore, &amp;c. because that I write not an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologie
for the Church of England, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
I woulde haue men to see the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Brownisme, what it is, viz so far
disagreing from the discipline of Christ,
that neither the frame of their building,
nor the builders themselues haue the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
of Gods worde, whereof they
spake; but in this their dealing are like
vnto the Cuthits &amp; the rest, who inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Samaria, falsely bragged that they
were the children of Iacob, and blindly
deceiued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues with a false worship,
as may appeare by one of them, I meane
the woman of Samaria, Iohn. 4. For as the
Lord had established his worship vppon
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:244:42"/>
mount Sion: so one Manasses to aduance
himselfe, erected a temple vppon mount
Gerazin, the Iewes according to Gods
appointment worshipped at Sion, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans
at Gerazin. A co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouersie rose
between them which of these people did
best.<note place="margin">Iohn. 42. 2.</note> Christ sayth to the Samaritanes, <hi>Yee
worship ye wot not what;</hi> yet they had a te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
a Priesthood, and other ordinances,
which were kept at Ierusalem. But who
gaue Manasses authoritie to erect a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
assemble a people, ordain, &amp;c. These
men came not so neere the discipline of
Christ, as the Samaritans did resemble
the discipline at Ierusalem: and Manas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
being the sonne of the high Priest had
as good a warrant for his proceedings,
as a priuate man might haue, and yet his
dealings were accursed. Nowe when
these me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> faile both in this, that they haue
not authoritie to erect discipline, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
if this were graunted, in that they

to giue notice of the wilful and obstinate
persons, that ecclesiasticall censure may
proceede against them. For proofe
whereof the places alleaged must haue a
gentle construction before they may be
accounted indifferent. For though Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit
10. Num. 18. and Ezech. 44. do speak
of the Priest: Likewise Psalme 23. and
Zach. 11. of Christ: yet can they not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
be applied vnto the Pastor, except
we adde this, that the Pastor must walke
in the steps of the Priest, and in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
aforesayd bee a follower of Christe.
And that also Reue. 22. 2. forasmuch as it
speaketh of the Church triumphant (as
the whole discourse doeth shewe) it can
hardly be brought to pertaine vnto the
Pastor, except wee saie that it is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
that the ende of his ministerie is
to bring the people of God vnto the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
of this estate. So that to fill the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:244:44"/>
quotations vnto the matter, wee haue
great need of a friendly expositor. Now
in the office of a pastor heere is an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to that which in the former place
was mentioned, that hee is to looke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the most <hi>secret thoughtes, thereby dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the diseases of his people;</hi> which
should seeme a heauy burthen, for a man
woulde thinke that the heart of man is a
bottomlesse deepe: and that <hi>no man could

in man,</hi> and that <hi>God onely trieth the heart
and the raines;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iere. 17. 9.</note> yet this is not so vnpossible
as it doth appeare at the first sight. For
there are diuerse meanes which may bee

had their auricular confession. And
yet there is a surer waie, namelie, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
the people (as some haue beene

that they may not come vnto the table

and also doe declare the same vnto the

to no purpose: For what doe these pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
cited tell vs? Ezech. 33. 1. setteth out
the dutie of a watchman. 1. Cor. 11. 19.
sheweth the necessitie of heresies. Ioh. 10
11. speaketh of the shepheard Christ, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit.
10. 11. (which also was alleadged for
the pastor) was spoken of the Priest, as
was Eze. 44. 24. and Mal. 2. 6. Paul. 1. Cor.
1. 7. saith that the Corinths were not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
of anie giftes. Also in the 1. Cor. 2.
4. he speaketh of himselfe being an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle.
The two places of his Epistle to Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothie,
do shew his dutie in the Church
of Ephesus, where (as these men saie) hee
had the function of an Euanglist. Paul E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe.
2. 20. telleth them that they are built
vppon the foundation of the Apostles
and Prophets, Heb. 6. and 1. Peter. 2. 2.
doe declare howe Gods people ought
to growe vp more and more in the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:244:45"/>
knowledge of Gods mysteries. I see not
how anie one of these places can direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prooue the office of a Doctor in the
Church: for either they do testifie the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of other callinges, or else they shewe
what matters are effected in the people
by the ministerie of the pastor. Now that
place of Paul the first Epistle to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,
the third Chapter and the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth
vearse, I haue kepte it vntill
the last place, for that I finde it most of
all abused, not so much because it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
here to a Doctor, and yet the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
spake it generally of all sortes of
builders: but for that the latter part of
this Scripture is here expounded of false
Prophets, which is to bee vnderstoode of
such teachers as alwaies keepe the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
and builde in Christ, howsoeuer
thorough their frailtie and weakenesse
they bee farre from that exacte puritie
which is required in handling the worde

some of the quotations, as Numb. 11. &amp;

wil therefore passe them ouer now. Meat

And as for the other places of Scripture
I will not seuerally handle them, because
they haue so small force in them to proue

That in the twe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tith of the Acts, &amp; 1. Pet. 5

that a man may weary his frends by vsing

that therein he maketh no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
a pastor and an elder. The residue
of the Scriptures are these, Deut. 16. 18.

               <head>Ansvvere.</head>
               <p>In these wordes are set downe these
principal points, first that in Gods church
euerie member is to seeke the good one
of an other, and also to further the good
of the whole bodie, Secondly, that a iarre
in the members, causeth a confusion of
the bodie. In both these we agree and do
allowe the ninth of Luke vers. 46. &amp;c. and
Ioh 13. 12. &amp;c. as good proofs for them;
although it is to be obserued that neither
of these places doe speake of these offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
for such there were not among the
disciples. Thirdly we are told that as eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
member is to performe the duties of
his calling, so is he not to intrude into the
function of others, vnto this I also conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend,
not for that our author saith it, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch
as he will not frame his actions
according vnto it;<note place="margin">Chrysost, in Act. hom. 1.</note> for <hi>doctore nihil frigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 12. 6.</note>

which teacheth in word onely is a simple

bicause we are willed to walke in our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
and to admonish those that are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly,
such as will not abide in that place
wherein the Lord hath set them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly he saith that the necessitie of
these officers is such, that whereas one of
them is wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting, there is a grieuous lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and apparant deformity of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodie,
&amp;c. and this is proued by 1. Cor. 12
and Ephesians 4. In both which places as
other giftes and offices are set downe to
haue bene in the church, as 1. Cor. 12. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
prophets, gifts of healing, diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities
of tongues, &amp;c. And Ephes. 4. Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
prophets and euangelists, so are not
all these officers required by our author
in those places spoken of, but in the place
to the Ephesians, the pastor and doctor
onely, and in the Corinthes, though hee
would indeuour to wring out elders and
deacons from thense, yet must hee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
that his widdowes are not
mentioned. Our author therefore may
as well say that the want of the Apostles,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:244:49"/>
Euangelists, gifts of healing and the rest
doe cause deformitie of the bodie (and
that by these places by himself alleaged)
as doth the want of Elders, Deacons &amp;
releeuers. Nay it hath bene alreadie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
that this gouernement was neuer to
be imposed vppon all sortes of people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
and that the want of some of these
offices haue neither bene deformitie in
the bodie, nor iniurie vnto the head. This
rather is an iniurie offered vnto Christ
Iesus, if either a priuat man should thrust
himselfe into a publike calling of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracie
or ministerie, without his war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
(as these Brownists doe both) or if a
publike magistrate shoulde prophane
Gods ordinances, by placing insufficient
men in so high a roome, as is the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the church; which must be done,
if this bee true which these men speake.
And thus much of the discipline where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the visible Churche (as they say)
shoulde bee gouerned; for we are now
once againe come to the conclusion of
this part.</p>

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:244:50"/>
of the bands, hath brought them to their

on vnder his conduct in the face of their
enemies bodily and ghostly to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
of sathan, sinne, hell and all. VVhat
wages he exspected for this his peece of
seruice is best knowne vnto him selfe; but
what faithfulnes he hath vsed in his dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
it is apparant vnto all: for in these
three things his packing is notorious.
First,<note place="margin">Matt. 16. 18.</note> that the victory of the church, which
she is assured of in and through the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Christ, is here restrained &amp; limited:
for our author doeth acknowledge it so
farre only as it enioyeth this foresaid go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement
of Pastors, Doctors, Elders,
&amp;c. Secondly, that the power of the word
of God,<note place="margin">Luk. 10. 18.</note> &amp; the ministerie thereof (which
is the sanctified meanes for sathans ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw,
and the building vp of Christ his
church, is here granted no otherwise, then
this word is preached vnder this outward
gouernement.<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 38. 39.</note> Lastly that the certainetie
of victorie which is by faith, is heere ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to the whole visible church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as if all
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:244:50"/>
the members thereof were truly faithful.
By this his practise he woulde conclude
that which as yet remaineth vnproued,
viz. that the necessitie of this gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
is such, that the enioyning of it is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to make the church without spot or
wrinckle, and that where this is wanting
there is no fight against fathan, no strife
against sinne, no victorie, no church ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant.
The testimonies of Scripture that
should helpe him herein (and are for the
same cause noted in the margent) do cut
the throat of these his follies. For thogh
he telleth vs that this armie of Sainctes
is martialled here on earth by these offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,<note place="margin">Reu. 19. 11. 14.</note>
yet the holy ghost describeth the
warrior and his traine, to be the warriors
which were in heauen. Though this man
saith that triumph is made by vertue of
this gouernment, yet the holy ghost saith
it is in pacience and constancie of faith,<note place="margin">Reue. 14. 12</note>
and obedience. And in a word though he
affirmeth that discipline is all in all, yet
the places noted by him speaking of the
power of Christ in his sernants ouercom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:244:51"/>

            <div type="excerpt">

               <p>Now this power which Christ hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
vnto his Church, and to euerie member of
his church, to keepe it in order, he hath not lefte
it to their discretions and lustes to bee vsed or

vnto his church of binding and
loosing, and hath also shewed an order
of proceeding: which assertions are to
be collected out of these three places of
Scriptures, which are twice noted in the
margent, that the number of testimonies
which they vsed might seeme greater
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:244:51"/>
then it is. But here we haue to marke, that
Christ is said to haue giuen this power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid
to euery member of the church,
so that heere is no difference made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene
the people, &amp; the gouernors; or at

                  </gap> he supposeth a difference to be

how farre the authoritie of the people is
extended. Againe, if the people be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
so greate an interest in the matters of
the church, we must thinke that the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
themselues, I meane the Deacons &amp;
releeuers were not to be secluded: which
being graunted, and seemeth here to be
concluded, not only women haue to dele

the description of euerie office, (the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
onely excepted) hath ben vnperfect,
seeing no such matter hath beene men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in any of them. Secondly, we are
to note, that he saith, that this order is not
left to the descretion of the church, for
if his meaning bee, that the censures of
the church ought to bee vsed with all fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie,
wee doe not gainesaie him,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:244:52"/>
but if hee meane that when they are not
duely executed, there the church doeth
cease to be the church apparant (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to that doctrine which in another
place they haue set downe) then do they
agree with the Anabaptists &amp; Donatists
herein,<note place="margin">In the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of the church ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant. Aduersus Anabapt. lib. 6. cap. 10 Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tra Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menianum. lib. 3. cap. 2.</note> who being sufficientlie answered
the one by Bullinger, the other by Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine,
I maruell that these men shoulde
not be satisfied and contented to reuoke
this error. The summe of whose answers
tend to this, that the end of excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
(for the question is not of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
but of the church censures in
this place) is, that the partie punished
might bee amended, that the credite of
the church might bee furthered, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
be not offended and made worse,
and that the church might be preserued
in peace. Therefore edification and the
welfare of the Church are especially to
be regarded: for better it were that wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
men should goe vnpunished, if the
punishing of them shoulde damnify the
Church.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 5.</note> Againe, the church of Corinth
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:244:52"/>
was the church of God, when they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
to proceede against the incestu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
person. Also the last supper of the
Lord was rightly administred, yet Iudas
was not excommunicate: the Prophets
complained of the sinnes of the church
in their times, yet contemned they not
the sacrifices, sacraments, and worship of
God. Christ and his Apostles blamed the
Church for grosse corruptions, yet was
he circumcised therein &amp;c. By which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
as by others by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> produced, we are
vrged to acknowledge that it may be the
Church of God, which doth not alwaies
proceede against the wicked according
to their deserts. Thirdly, we are to marke
that hee ascribeth the keies of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of heauen to the officers before na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
whereas Christ committed this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,

               <p>I thought it conuenient to ioyne al this
togither, being but one matter, viz. the
proceeding of the church, and of euerie
member thereof: Concerning the which
I say, with them that God hath not onely
giuen a charge to euerie member of the
church to looke vnto his steppes, that he
refraine from offending his fellow mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
least thorough his owne default
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:244:54"/>
the church be prouoked to proceed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, but also hath prescribed vnto
the Church her order of proceeding;
which order I grant to be here set downe
in part; namely, so long as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersations
of men are in question; but in
matters of faith these rules will faile: for
although it be the nature of man to erre,
&amp; in his errors we may not depriue him
of admonitions, yet if his error do proue
an heresie, after once or twice admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
at the vtmost he is to be reiected. For a
simple error may be healed, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersnesse
is incurable: and the manner of
his reiection is not in a bare forsaking of
him, but in restraining him, least that by
his false doctrine the simple sort be sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.
I speake not now of the Magistrates
authoritie,<note place="margin">Tit. 3. i0.</note> who was commanded by the
Lord to cut off the false prophet; but I
speake of the ecclesiasticall power, which
hath his wara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for the suppressing of such:
the order of whose proceeding is first ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition,
then excommunication, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to make the magistrate acquainted
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:244:55"/>
both with this euill, and with his duety in
proceeding against it, (for I will not vrge
that of master Bullinger, who seemeth
to go farther in asking this question) viz.
if the church had onely authoritie to flie
from, and not to chastice an heretike,
how came it to passe that the Apostle Paul
by the power of God depriued Elimas of
his sight,<note place="margin">Act. 13. 8. 9.</note> bicause he did stubbernly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
falshood, and withstand the truth?
But this point of discipline hath in wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
bene passed ouer, least that our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
shuld therin haue blamed both our
teachers and our Magistrates for their
to much lenitie in this schisme and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie.
Now as touching the florish that is
made with a great shew of scriptures in
the margent, it is more then childish; not
in regard of applying them, though one
or two of them might be amended, but in
respect of the vaine alledging of one
scripture often, as Matth. 18. 15. 16.
Leuiticus 19. 17. 18. Prou. 10. 12. &amp;c.

               <p>Here we haue described vnto vs the
state wherein this visible church doth
stand, both in regard of the conenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
God and it; and also in respect of
the sanctimonie thereof in the sight of
men. As for the former of these, it is to be
granted: but howsoeuer the promises are
made vnto the church, and the worship
approoued of God, is kept and retained
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:244:56"/>
therein, yet may it fall out that some one
member thereof may haue no interest in
the promises, as Matth. 22. 13. nor yet be
a true worshipper of God, as Eccles. 4. 17<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
And although the church hath this digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
giuen vnto it thorow an especiall
grace, yet some one man, who is not of
the visible church may be partaker of
the promises, and a true worshipper of
God; as Naaman the Syrian, and Iob
in the land of Hus; the visible church
then being among the people of Israel.
As touching the other matter; viz. that
this church apparant is commended vnto
vs both for the puritie thereof in it selfe,
and also for the vncleannesse of all those
which are not members of the same. It is a
palpable grosnes to conceiue, &amp; a sottish
follie to publish such a dreame. For, are al
they cleane which enter into the visible
church? these men themselues haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
the contrarie.<note place="margin">Gen. 4. 21.</note> Are all the members
of the visible church written in the lambs
booke of life?<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 16.</note> who then blotted out
Cain,<note place="margin">Num. 16. 33<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:244:56"/>
Againe, is it true that all those which are
not vnder this gouernement are dogs,
&amp;c. I will not aske what shall become of
these men themselues, but what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of Peter and the rest that remained
with Christ; and of all the churches of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,
Ephesus, Corinth, and the rest,
which had not this gouernement and all
these offices at any time among them?
for some wanted Deacons, some widows,
some vnministring Elders, some Doctors.
To draw to an end. The scriptures that
are alledged to proue these matters are
either promises of that full redemption,
which is obtained and shall be perfited
vnto the church in the day of Christs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing,
as Esa. 52. 1. and 35. 8. and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation
28. 27. or else are they types
thereof, as Eze. 44. and the ninth verse,
and Zacharie 14. 21. VVherefore they
cannot proue the truth hereof in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
church of God. Also Reuel. 22.
15. sheweth the estate of the vngodly,
which in the day of that generall search
shall be thrust out of the presence of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:244:57"/>
God. VVhich matter Paul doth plainly
shew. Rom. 2. 9. for hee threatneth op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
and anguishe vnto euerie soule
that doth euill, whether Iew or Greeke,
that is, whether of the visible Church or
not. In this one thing these men may be
commended, that seeing their assertions
cannot bee warranted by the woorde of
of God, they will doe the best they can
to make their sayings true in themselues.
For surely they coulde not possiblie giue
ouer themselues vnto a doggish disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as they do, if they were not perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that in so dooing the conditions of
men which haue cast off gouernement
should in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be made manifest vnto the
world. VVee are therefore to desire for
them, that discipline may be put in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise,
if happely they may bee brought to
some good order.</p>

what it is amongst conceited diuines. And that the
truth may be more euident, I wil set downe first their
Articles, which sometimes they did hold, and now
are charged with. Secondly, the sore complaints that

fondnesse of their assertions; which (for the auoiding
of tediousnes) shalbe done either by referring the

handled elsewhere, or else by plaine and euident
proofes.</p>
            <p>The Articles which are so iniuriously imputed vnto them (as

            <p>1 THat it is not lavvfull to vse the Lords praier pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likelie

            <p>2 Secondlie that all set and stinted praiers are meere
babling in the sight of the Lord, not to be vsed in publike
Christian assemblies.</p>
            <p>3 Thirdly, that the publique praiers and vvorship of
God in England, as it is by lavv in the church of England
established, is false, superstitious, popish, and not to be vsed
in anie Christian congregation.</p>
            <p>4 That the Church of England as it is novv establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
is no entire member of the church of Christ.</p>
            <p>5 That the gouernment of the church of England, as it

but antichristian and popish.</p>
            <p>6 That the Sacraments of baptisme &amp; the Lords sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
as they are administred in the church of England, be
not true sacraments.</p>
            <p>7 That infants ought not to be baptised, according to

            <p>8 Manie of them make scruple to affirme, that the

            <p>12 That the Church of England, as it novv standeth by

            </p>
            <p>Now they complaine that they are much abused in
being charged with these matters, for the title of one
of the Treatises is, A <hi>collection of certaine slanderous ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
giuen out by the bishops, against such faithful Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
as they now vniustly detaine in their prisons, &amp;c.</hi>
The Epistle saith, that <hi>there are spersed abroad through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the land, certaine articles of the bishops owne deuising
against these men to bring them into hatred vvith the
vvhole land.</hi> The Author in answering the said Articles
termeth them <hi>forged positions.</hi> Again, <hi>God forbid</hi> (saith
he) <hi>that our Magistrates should be guiltie of our inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
blood by such slanderous reports.</hi> To be short, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
Barrow (as he himselfe reporteth) complained to
Doctor Androwes, that <hi>he hath bene greeuouslie slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
blasphemed, and accused by spearsed articles, &amp;c.</hi>
therefore a great fault there is in those, which offer
these persecuted Christians (for so they terme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues)
this great iniurie; or else in them who, if the
Black-amore could change his hue, would deny their
owne opinions: but if they giue the lie vnto vs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
iust cause, as it shall appeare that they do, by that
which followeth, and maintaine these things, which
thus confide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly they haue denied, in crying out, they
are slandered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then wil it also be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fessed, that they are
not persecuted Christians, but vnbridled factioners.
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:244:59"/>
For these are no slanderous positions, as they say, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
against them by the bishops; but phantasticall
assertions first deuised, and now againe confirmed by
themselues, as by their seuerall handling of the seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Articles they do shew.</p>
            <p>To the first Article therefore they say,<note place="margin">That they are not slandered.</note> that neither
the Lords Prayer, nor any other praier in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
may be vsed but by explication; Also, <hi>that they
serue onely for instruction.</hi> Againe, <hi>That the verie forme
of words as they are in these petitions was giuen and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
as a set and stinted prayer () we finde not in
the scriptures.</hi> Also, <hi>to vse it for a set prayer, is</hi> (say they)
<hi>a stinting of the holy Ghost.</hi> Now if these assertions do
not agree with the Article, and testifie that they
do hold it, they haue the greater cause to complaine;
but I see no difference betwene the one &amp; the other.</p>
            <p>Now the folly of this Article is manifest in this; that
the Lords prayer was giuen for the same end, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other
prayers were in the canonicall scripture; but other
prayers were not for instruction, as hath bin shewed
before, pag. 23. I need not make the conclusion.</p>
            <p>And as touching their denying the forme of praier
which Christ gaue to his disciples to be his praier, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we reade not that he euer vsed it: And their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusing
vs to be falsifiers of the text, when we call it
the Lords Prayer, If it were not a strife about words,
I would say more; whereas now I wil onely put them
in minde, that we haue learned this phrase of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost, who calleth the prayers which God hath
taught, and doth approue his prayers, as Esa. 56. 7.
<hi>I vvil make them glad (bebeth tepillati) in the house of my
prayer,</hi> for there it is called the Lords prayer, not for
that he vsed it, but because he prescribed it. And why
then may not we in like sort cal this the Lords praier,
in as much as he hath taught it:<note place="margin">Porphirius.</note> but of this enough, lest
it be said of vs, <hi>para men gar hemin esti logoma chia, &amp;c</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:244:59"/>
To the 2. article they say, that the canonicall praiers
commended to vs by Gods spirite, haue this onely
vse, that they <hi>serue for instruction.</hi> And that our mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and euening praiers are not onely a babling, but
apocriphall and idolatrous, &amp;c. So that neither cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall
nor other praiers that are prescribed, are dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
lawfull to be vsed for praiers in the sight of the
Lord. Whereby it is made manifest, that they are not
vniustly charged with this Article. Which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
is but a false assertion, considering that sette
praiers were vsed vnder the lawe, are not forbidden
in the gospell, and are also vsed in all reformed chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
vntil this daie.</p>
            <p>To the 3. article they saie, that our <hi>liturgie is drawen
out of the Popes portuise, is not onely idolatrous, supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and a deuised worship, but a bundle of infinite, grosse,
&amp; blasphemous errours, a Pseudodiathesis,</hi> a counterfet
gospell, an idoll, and huge <hi>Chaos of long, gathered, and
patched absurdities, a new gospel, a masse booke,</hi> and what
not? How then are they slandered, when it is sayde
that they account our worship of God, as it is now e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished,
to be false, superstitious, and popish? But
the best is, these calumniations are not greatly to be
regarded: for if they need not to be ashamed of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the truth of Donatus, who was a schismatical he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retique,
wee haue as small cause to cast awaie good
things, though it could be proued, as it is not, that we
had taken them from an heretike. And though no
worke of man, and so not our booke of publike prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
can be free from all blemishes, the Lord reseruing
this glorie to himselfe, that hee will bee acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
perfectly wise, and his workes onely voide of
imperfection: yet so farre is this booke from deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
these great reproches, that it beeing compared
with the best treatise that these disturbers haue
brought forth, the most grosse and blasphemous er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:244:60"/>
which they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> proue therin, may be iustified in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of many that are deliuered for sound doctrine
in their pamphlets, if both of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be right vnderstood.</p>
            <p>To the 4. they say, that <hi>it being subiect to the vvorship
aforesaid, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sisting of al sorts of vnclen spirits, atheists,
papists, heretikes, &amp;c. it is not a true me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of the bodie of
Christ.</hi> It is not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> blasphemy to charge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with this
4. article. And whether they haue cause to hold it vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
this ground or not, shal be euident hereafter.</p>
            <p>To the fifth article, It is euident to al men (saie they)
and confessed of our enimies, that the ministers, laws,
and other ordinances, whereby the parish assemblies
are gouerned, are not such as Christ appointed to his
church, of pastor, &amp;c. but by such officers, courts, and
canons as are hatched from Rome. Do they not then
iustifie this article, wherin, as in others, they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaine
they are slandered? yet in as much as they are consta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
in it, let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> proue by the word of God both their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline
to be good, &amp; also our gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to be An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian,
which they will hardlie afford, considering
that before the time of papacy there were these offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in the church which these men terme Antichristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
as M. Caluin testifieth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Inst. li. 5. ca. 4. se. 4. whose
authoritie I vse with these men, because I finde that
they themselues haue alleaged the same.</p>
            <p>To the 6. article they saie, that <hi>vve neither hauing a
lavvfull ministerie, nor faithfull holie free people, &amp;c. the
sacraments in our assemblies deliuered, are no true sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
nor seales vvith promise.</hi> How the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can these men
without blushing, put this article in the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
positio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidering that they make their iudg<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ments
knowen concerning this point, I maruell more
they are not ashamed to denie it, then I do that some
of them Donatist like, haue desired to be baptised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.
The answer to this wilbe easie by that which fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
in the answer to the 3 bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch of the 5. argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:244:60"/>
To the seauenth, they say that no <hi>godlie Christians
separate from the false church, ought to bring their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
to these parish assemblies, to bee baptised into that
fellovvship and profession, &amp;c.</hi> These wordes do iustifie
our Bishops in charging these men with this article.
The substance whereof seeing it doth depend vpon
the former article, the follies of it being perceaued
the want of wisedom in this will soone be descried.</p>
            <p>To the eight they say that <hi>all true christians vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
her maiestie dominions, acknovvledge her Maiestie to
be the supreame</hi> magistrate and gouernes ouer all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
within the church and without the church, <hi>yea,
ouer all causes</hi> ecclesiasticall and ciuill. Which asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
if it had bene receiued of the whole sect, then
it had bene a slander in deed, but in as much as in an
assembly of aboue twentie persons, it was concluded,
that <hi>her Maiestie is not supreame head of the church,
neither hath authoritie</hi> to make lawes ecclesiastical in
the church: they must acknowledge a dissent of iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
amongst themselues, or else confesse that there
was a time when they were of another opinion, but
now they haue learned to be more wise, yet the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueat
that is giuen hath a secret meaning, viz. a gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the latter part of this article, that her maiestie
hath no authoritie to make anie lawes ecclesiasticall.
But this being so closely couered, I minde not to
see it, I conceiue the best, namely, that as they yeelde
more to her maiestie then of former times they haue
done, so will they in time grant her that right which
is due vnto her roiall authoritie.</p>
            <p>Of the ninth article they saie, that <hi>the lavves eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall
vvherevvith our assemblies are guided,</hi> are not
deriued from the booke of God, but culled out from
that great Antichrists canons, orders, &amp; deuillish pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licies,
&amp;c. that they are the execrable wares of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ
statuts of Omry, &amp; not to be receiued or obeied
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:244:61"/>
of anie that loue the Lord Iesus. This article then is
maintained by these men, and not vniustly imputed
to them. But as touching this grieuous accusation, we
are here also to call to minde, that the lawes of God
are onely perfect, the decrees and statutes of men,
though holy, yet haue their wants. In regard wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
I doe acknowledge a want of perfection, but the
deformitie of these laws doth seeme greater, partly by
the meanes of such as shoulde dispose them more vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly,
and partly by reason of others, who haue a
malitious eie in beholding, and an enuious tongue in
reproching them.</p>
            <p>Vnto the tenth article, they answere, that <hi>they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
looke for the reformation of Babel, our false Church,</hi>
for so they tearme it, <hi>nor take vpon them to intermeddle</hi>
with the magistrates swoord: but all that will bee sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
must forsake the false church, and by repentance
come vnder Christs obedience to serue God aright
in his true church, &amp;c. Neither may they neglect
the seruice of GOD, nor the practise of any parte
thereof, &amp;c. Though the Prince shoulde in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibite,
&amp;c. So that they affirme, that of their owne au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
they are not only to separate themselues from
vs, but also to prctaise the discipline which they haue
fansied, though her maiestie shoulde inhibite the one
or commaunde the other: so that this article is not
wrongfully fathered vpon them. But before this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
be granted vnto them as a true position, they
must not onelie conuince our church, as out of the
which there ought to be a departure, but also they
must proue that a priuate man may attempt reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the church, contrarie to that which hath bene
spoken.</p>
            <p>To the eleuenth article they saie, first that the pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterie
may not excommunicate any person by their
sole power, seeing Christ hath giuen this power to
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:244:61"/>
the whole church. This is made more plaine in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place, where one of them saith, that the least
member of the church that is a communicant hath as
much interest in all the censures of the church, as the
pastor. Secondly, they affirme that the prince if he
will be a member of the church, must be subiect to
the censure in the church. The which two positions
being considered, it shall be needlesse to open what
these men would haue: but of the authoritie of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uat
man hath ben spoken sufficiently heretofore.</p>
            <p>To the twelfth they answer roundly in this sort, <hi>as
for your religion, church, sacramentes, &amp;c. vve haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
shevved the forgerie of them, vnto the vvhich for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

these twelue articles there is not one, wherewith they
are abused or vniustly charged, and therefore are
their exclamations before mentioned vaine.</p>
            <div type="articles">
               <head>There are in the ende of the foresaid pamphlet
other twelue articles, not vnlike to the former,
which they tearme slanderous articles also
forged against them, as if they did not
hold them, which are these.</head>
               <p>1 THey hold that the Lords praier or anie set praier is
blasphemie, and they neuer vse anie praier for the
Queene, as supreame head vnder Christ of the church of
England.</p>
               <p>2 That all set praiers or stinted praies, or read seruice
are but meere babling in Gods sight, and plaine Idolatrie.</p>
               <p>3 They teach there is no head or supreame gouernor of
the church of Christ: and that the Queene hath none au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
in the church to make lavves ecclesiasticall.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:244:62"/>
4 They teach that a laie man may beget faith; and that
vve haue no need of publike administration.</p>
               <p>5 They condemne all comming to Church, al preaching
all institution of Sacraments, and saie that all the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
vvere sent by God in his anger to deceiue the people.</p>
               <p>6 They affirme that the people must reforme the church
and not tarie for the magistrate, and that the Primitiue
church sued not to courts and parliaments, nor vvaited
vpon princes pleasures: but vve make Christ to attend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
princes, &amp; to be subiect to their lavvs &amp; gouernment.</p>
               <p>7 That the booke of common praier is a pregnant Idol &amp;
full of abhominations, a peece of svvines flesh, and abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to the Lord.</p>
               <p>8 They saie it is a greater sinne to go to the church to
publik praiers, then for a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to lie vvith his fathers vvife</p>
               <p>9 Those that vvil not refrain from our churches, prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
or seruice, they giue vnto the deuil &amp; exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municat.</p>
               <p>10 They hold it not lavvfull to baptise children among
vs: they neuer haue anie sacrament among them.</p>
               <p>11 They refuse to take an oath to be examined.</p>
               <p>12 They vvill not marrie amongst vs in our churches,
but resort to the Fleet &amp; to other places to bee married by
one <hi>Greenwood</hi> and <hi>Barrow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All which, whether these men are vniustly blamed
with them, or do hold them as firme as they do the
former Articles, I leaue vnto the consideration of all
men. Their iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the two first articles
hath bene set downe alredie; for they do little differ
from those two positions set downe in the former
place: Likewise concerning the third article, we haue
had their minde in the eight article, so that it shall be
needlesse either to shew again that those are by their
desert imputed vnto them, or that in maintaining the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
their warrants be of smal force. And the fourth article
is so far from being an vngodly calumniation against
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they hold it not only a possible thing for a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:244:62"/>
man to beget faith, but also lawfull for him to
preach the word &amp; interpret the scriptures in publike
assemblies. Wherin a question might be moued, what
is the differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwene him y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is <hi>Leitourgos,</hi> a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of Christ in their publike functio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; &amp; euery priuate
man in the congregation, both hauing equall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
as well in preaching, as in the censures of the
church? Also, what these priuate men are to be estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in preaching, whether ministers, or no mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
vnto the people whom they teach? mutuall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations
I grant to be necessarie amongst the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God, wherby the faith of the godly may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased;
whereof is mention made, Act. 18. 26. 1. Pet.
4. 10. 1. Thess. 5. 11. And the euils in others might be
restrained; wherof Iames speaketh, Cap. 5. 19. 20. And
Paul 1. Cor. 7. 16. For as I yeeld vnto the author of this
discourse, that these fiue places of scripture do proue
one and the same matter, so I hope he will call home
his wits, &amp; grant vnto me that they proue not a prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
in the publike assemblie, considering that the
woman, of whom this dutie of exhorting is required,
1. Cor. 7. 16. is not allowed to speake in the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The other places of scriptures alledged, viz.
Luk. 10. and 1. Cor. 14. do mention a publike dealing
with the word, but neither were the 70. (when Christ
sent forth priuate men) nor yet the others spoken of
in the Corinthes, where he speaketh not of all the
faithfull, but of all the Prophets; as master Caluin al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
noteth vpon that place, that in Luk. 8. 39. Act. 8. 4.
and 11. 19. can make nothing for this matter vntill it
be proued that the men there mentioned, first were
priuate men, 2. executed a ministery in the publike as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblie,
and lastly had no extraordinarie sending
forth. The place of Paul Philip. 2. verse 15. and 16.
speaketh not of preaching, but of the conuersation
which should be such in the middest of a froward
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:244:63"/>
people, as might be a meanes to winne them without
the word, who had no care of the word. The other
place, 1. Pet. 3. 2. pertaineth nothing to the matter in
question; so that as yet it remaineth vnprooued, that
a priuate man may preach in the congregation. Of
which matter Master Caluin speaketh, Instit. lib. 4.
cap. 3. sect. 10. and if they may not preach, then can
they not beget faith; for none can be called to the
true faith without the preaching of the gospel, as they
themselues haue affirmed in their last conference
with Doctor Andrewes. Therefore this is not a slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous
article to bring them into hatred vniustlie,
but a blind deuise to bring confusion into the church.</p>
               <p>The fift article here set downe and the seuenth, are
the same with that, which was set in the third place
in the beginning.</p>
               <p>The sixt article, being all one with the tenth of the
former sort, hath also bene considered of.</p>
               <p>To the 8. article they saie, that to go to the church
to publike praiers, is a high sinne against the first ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
which being but a begging of the question, they
must first proue our worship to be idolatrie, before
their calumniation is to be harkened vnto.</p>
               <p>To the ninth they say, that they iudge not them
that are without, but those that hauing left all false
assemblies, &amp;c. haue ioyned with them, &amp;c. And if
among them any fall into error, them do they excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate.
As here is no slander, so may we see the
confusion of their doctrine, and their practises to be
accordingly. First, the priuate man hath as much au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
in the censures of their church, as Pastor, El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
or any other. Secondly, that their church hath au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
ouer those that haue ioyned with them: from
these sweete positions haue sprong this excellent har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie,
that euerie man presumeth amongst them to
excommunicate one another, as hath bin seene, and is
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:244:63"/>
dayly manifest, both in the Clinke and other prisons;
for as <hi>Theodoret</hi> saith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <note place="margin">De fide.</note> 
                  <hi>ex ipsa ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiam pestem superbie
contraxerunt.</hi> Ignorance hath brought them to pride:
which he compareth vnto the plague, because as it
infecteth the bodie, so pride peruerteth the mind; for
from it do spring a stubborne disobedience towards
others, hypocrisie seeking glorie in outward appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
wilfulnesse in defending the euill, least their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
should appeare, discord, ech man labouring to
be singular, deuise of nouelties, &amp;c. And therefore it
is no wonder, to behold the readinesse of euerie of
them in casting off submission; boasting of godlines,
and maintaining falshood: yet whiles euerie man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteth
glorie by new deuises; the dissention is such,
that one sort excommunicateth another, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated
do the like for the other, that euen the
Papists who behold the same in their prisons, laugh
at such confusion.</p>
               <p>The tenth article is all one with the sixt in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
number.</p>
               <p>To the 11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they say, that they refuse not an oath by
the holy name of God, 2. before a lawful Magistrate,
3. vpon iust occasion, according to the word: but our
oathes they say, are rash and vngodly. First, by or with
a booke. Secondly offred &amp; enforced by the Bishops.
Thirdly at their pleasure vpon euery occasion, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the word of God, the lawes of the land, &amp; dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie
to her Maiesties prerogatiue royall: so that if
we say that these men refuse to take an oath accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the laws of our land, it wil appere no slander.</p>
               <p>Now co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning their iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, we agree with them
that the Lord condemneth all false, rash, and vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
oathes: that is, such oathes as are in matters of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth,
in things of small importance; and by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
any other to witnesse, but God onely: for the
which may be alledged, Deut. 6. 13. Ierem. 4. 2.
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:244:64"/>
Heb. 6. 16. and many others. Herein we dissent, first
that they seeme to allow an oath before a magistrate
onely, wherein they condemne the deede of Iacob
and Laban, Gen. 31. 53. and of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oos to Ruth, Ruth.
3. 13. and of Obadia to Eliah, 1. Reg. 18. 10. who being
all but priuat persons, yet doe confirme with an oath
the matters in question betwene them. Secondly, that
they will not acknowledge those to haue authoritie
to take an oath, to whom her maiestie hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the same. Thirdly, that they condemne the forme
of swearing before the magistrate, which by the laws
of Englang is vsed; for as Abraham in vrging his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant
Eleazar to sweare Gen. 24. 2. and Iacob taking
an oath of Ioseph Gen. 47. 29. said. <hi>Put thine hand vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
my thigh</hi> (a ceremonie vsed among the Ethiopians
and Indians vntill this day) can not be charged to
haue vsed an idolatrous rite, inasmuch as the oath
was not taken by the thigh, but by the God of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
and the creator of the earth: so likewise the hand
is laid vpon the booke, the oath is not vrged to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by the booke, but by him, whom the doctrine of
that booke maketh knowne vnto vs; of both which
rites we neede not feare to say: <hi>Prophanos ritus non
esse, qui Dei gloriae quicquam detraherent; quia interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitur
Dei nomen, &amp;c.</hi> Neither do the places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
cited infringe this: for Amo. 5. 4. is not at all spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of an oath, but generally that men shoulde seeke
out that which is good and not euill. The other three
places, viz. Zoph. 1. 5. Matth. 5. 34. and 23. 16. disproue
not an outward ceremony in an oath; onely Zephanie
telleth that God condemneth those which doe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
worshippe Idols though they keepe the heart
vnto God; and Christ sheweth that God is onely to
be our witnes in al our asseuerations: our maner of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
an oth is not against it. The other calumniations
are not worth the answering.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:244:64"/>
To the twelfth they say, that the action of matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
is <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>erely ciuill, therefore lawfull in all places
and at all times to marrie in the Lorde by the consent
of parents; denying that they haue married anie, but
together with other faithfull, haue beene witnesses of
the same. It is plaine therefore that some haue bene
contracted in the prison, and married, and they haue
had their part in the action. But I woulde haue these
men to consider: First, that euerie soule inciuill
and indifferent matters is to submit himselfe vnto

Paule vnto the Romanes the thirteenth chapter and
the first verse. Secondly, that marriage is a matter al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together

by the lawes of our lande is manifest.</p>

               <p>Nowe therefore we may conclude that neither the
twelue positions in the beginning, nor the twelue ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
in the ende of this first treatise, are forged posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
slanderous articles and vngodly calumniations

wicked assertions, that it may bee truely said of the

               <p>There is a thirteenth article, whereof they greatly
glorie, that it hath bene passed ouer with silence, that
neither tithes, nor set liuings are a matter warrantable
in the word of God; the one being Leuiticall &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
abrogated, the other without stay to leane vpon

but did not condition for anie certaintie. To
whom I answere, that if a sufficient maintenance is to
be had for the ministerie, it is requisite some order be
taken for them how they may come by it: for if it be
left to the discretion of men, it will be short enough,
in regard whereof the Lorde ordained a set liuing for
the Leuites, not in the example of Michah his Leuit,
with whom these men do sport themselues, but in his
ordinance of tithes, &amp;c. which as they were ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall
to them that paid them, being instructed therby
that the increase of al thing is of God to whom praise
is due for the same: so to them that receaued the same
it was a meanes, wherby the certainty of their main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
might be had. And this was not left to the
discretion of the people, but euery man was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
what to pay.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 9. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Do ye not know</hi> (saith Paule) <hi>that they
which minister about the holie things, eat of the things of
the temple, &amp; they which waite at the altar are partakers
of the altar?</hi> He proceedeth in applying this vnto the
ministerie of the Gospell:<note place="margin">ver. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>So also hath the Lord ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
that they vvhich preach the Gospell should liue of the
Gospell.</hi> Therefore as vnder the law there was a sette
maintenance for the priest: so vnder the Gospel there
may be the like for the ministers thereof, except we
coulde finde the people better affected nowe, then
they were at that time vnto the ministerie. <hi>They
are to rest vpon the good vvill of the breethren,</hi> say they.
But how is this proued? For to speake without war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the worde in teaching innouation is fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
But I know that it will be sooner granted to
the minister to haue a certaine stay of liuing, then that
he shoulde haue the same in tithes, for that was cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall,
and therefore to continue it, <hi>is to deny Christ
to be come in the flesh.</hi> I answer that the paying of tiths
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:244:65"/>
was ceremoniall, but there was an other vse of them
also: so was the temple ceremoniall, wherein the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
assembled together vnto the worshippe of God.
Now if any man should vse the temples (I meane the
places of praier) or the paying of tithes as ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
it were a deniall of the abrogation of the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall
lawe, but the temple hauing an other vse,
namely, that it might be a conuenient place for the
people to meete in for the exercise of the worde, &amp;c.
which is not ceremoniall, it is no denying that Christ
is come in the flesh, though in this respect we do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
this vse of them, so the tithes being not onely
ceremoniall, but hauing this vse also that the ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
might be maintained, no such iniurie is offred vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Christ in the retaining of them for this ende onely.
And thus this glorious article may goe together with
his fellowes, all of them deseruing glorie alike.</p>

                  <p>Here is confirmed that which was spoken pag. 11.
viz. that the matters mentioned in that treatise are
so necessarily required, that the want of anie of them
taketh away the <hi>esse</hi> of the church: for here in a fewe
lines is knit vp, that which more at large was then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered:
yet some things at the first not thought vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon,
are here added. And both the old and new mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
iointly and seuerally are propounded, as hauing
strength sufficient to ouerthrow not our church on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but all others also that are not framed, according
to their rule. I will answere them therefore in that
order, which the author hath vsed in drawing these
matters into arguments. The first argument of theirs
is this.</p>

                  <p>Seeing the propositions both of this and the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
following are set downe before it should seme
that of purpose they are nowe omitted; yet to make
the matter plaine, the argument is after this manner.</p>
                  <p>The true planted and right established church of
Christ is a company of faithful people, but the church
of Englande is not a companie of faithfull people.
Therefore not a true planted and rightly established
church.</p>
                  <p>Whereunto I answere, that the assumption is with
great insolency set downe, as if magistrates, ministers
&amp; people were without exception of any, a flocke of
goates, a companie of hell hounds. Likewise the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
sauoreth of Anabaptistry, whiles it admitteth
none to be members of the visible church, but faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
people onely. But concerning the assumption, I
grant, that some of Cain his brood, of Cham his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
and of Esau his qualities, are in our church, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
as there are amongst these persecuted Christians
some of the schollers of Shimei, some of Corah his
company, some Ismaels, &amp;c. Herein is the difference
betweene their church and ours, that we account of
such beastes as they are, though wee labour by the
worde and other meanes to bring them vnto repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
but if their Atheists can but say that discipline
is good (though they knowe not what it meaneth) if
they wil heaue at magistracy, &amp; raile vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
gouernement, they must be presently canonized
&amp; registred in the booke of the faithfull, whatsoeuer
their conditions are otherwise. In the proposition I
see nothing which hath not beene answered pag. 12.
&amp;c. only here are certaine scriptures cited in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
so farre from proouing the matter in question,
that if they be vnderstoode of euery member of the
visible church, to prooue them faithfull, we may
with as good reason from the same places conclude,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:244:67"/>
that neither the publike ministerie, nor priuat admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions
are to be vsed in the visible church, for these
are the wordes of Ieremie: <hi>And they shall teach no more
euerie man his neighbour, and euerie man his brother say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
knowe the Lorde, for they shall all knowe me from the
least of them to the greatest of them, saith the Lord, for I
vvill forgiue their iniquitie, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <head>Ansvver.</head>
                  <p>This is the argument. The true church is a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of people separated from the vnbeleeuers, &amp; hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
of the lande, but the church of Englande hath
made no separatlon, &amp;c. therefore, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The proposition is denied, if such a separation be
vnderstoode as is spoken of Matth. 25. 32. as hath bin
proued pag. 11. 12. &amp;c. but if they take it, as it is in
the place by them selues alleaged, Leuit. 20. 24. we do
grant it: for Israell is there said to be separated from
that heathen, yet was it not separated from all vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers,
onely it was in respect of their outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.
The assumption in the former sence is gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but otherwise it is euident to be a meere slander,
for neither are any receaued into our church, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
they ioyne with vs in outward profession, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are their children baptized, except the parents,
or some for the parents do promise to see the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> brought
vppe in the knowledge of God, and faith in Christ
Iesus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But they proue this assumption after this sort:</hi> They
vvere all <hi>(say they)</hi> by the blovving of her maiesties trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet
at her coronation,<note place="margin">In their first &amp; third confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with M. Hutchinson.</note> in one day receiued vvithout con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion
of life by faith and repentance, and they and their
seede euer since generallie receaued to your sacramentes,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:244:67"/>
without any separation from the world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Before I make answere vnto this assertion, I would
learne (if I might) how these men would haue the
people to come vnto an established church at the
first. For they tel vs,</hi> 1. That there can be no true church,
vntill euerie member therof hath by faith and repentance
separated himselfe from the vnbeleeuers.<note place="margin">In their first conference with master Hutchinson.</note> 
                     <hi>But how shall
they come vnto this faith? for they tell vs also,</hi> 2. That
none can haue true faith and repentance, but such as are
called thereunto by the preaching of the gospel. <hi>And how
shall they haue this Gospel preached vnto them?</hi>
3. There must be sheepe before there can be a flocke; there
must be a flocke before there can be a shepheard, because
the people must choose their Pastor:<note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                     <hi>so that they affirme
that</hi> the people must be brought to the faith, before they
can haue a Pastor, and yet they cannot haue faith vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
preaching. <hi>Which way then shall this preaching
be had, for the attaining vnto faith?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Magistrate</hi> (say they) <hi>ought to compel the Infidels
to heare the doctrine of the church,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Conference with master Cooper. pa. 59.</note> 
                     <hi>and also vvith the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
of the church to send forth meete men, vvith
gifts and graces to instruct the Infidels, being yet no mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
or officers vnto them:</hi> but in the time of Poperie,
they affirme that the people could not be the church;
&amp; therefore I would be resolued in these two points:
First where the magistrate in such a case shuld haue a
church to giue consent vnto his sending forth of such
teachers to instruct infidels? And thus haue they led
vs about, &amp; haue brought vs to the same place where
we were at the first. And secondly what they are,
which thus are sent by the magistrate and the church,
if not ministers of the word vnto those infidels whom
they teach? and herein we require an answere by the
word.</p>
                  <p>Now to our assertion, concerning our turning from
Poperie at the blowing of her maiesties trumpet. I
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:244:68"/>
doubt not but this will be graunted, that some of Q.
Maries subiects beleeued, and made a bold confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their faith, who to the ioye of all christian
hearts in the lande, remaine in our church vntill this
daie. Others there were like vnto Nichodemus in his
comming to Christ by night, and in his faint defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the truth (who if the Lord should for our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulnes
send a scourge) wold with Nichodemus
make a bolde confession of their loue to Christ Iesus.
So that all were not Pagans that embraced the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell
at the sounding of her maiesties trumpet,<note place="margin">Ioh. 32. &amp; 7. 50.</note> &amp; bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
faithfull,<note place="margin">Ioh. 19. 39.</note> the seales of the couenant did pertaine
vnto their seed. But some (it may be) ioyned for feare
in the outward profession (who these were, the sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
of mans heart doth know:)<note place="margin">Ios. 5. 3.</note> So did Ismael in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams
house, Caine in Adams house, and these vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull
Israelites vnder Iosua, when at his only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
they were all circumcised. There was
therefore such a separation at her maiesties entrance
vnto the Crowne, as the visible Church in all ages
from the beginning hath afforded.</p>

                  <p>The true church obeyeth Christ as her king, and
reteineth his gouernement; but the church of

                  <p>We are to remember that the question is of outward
gouernment, which hath bene shewed pag. 25. not to

we ad their own confession, that the <hi>true church
may be vvithout sacraments,</hi> which we hold as necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
as outward gouernment. But we are here charged
with a double crime, viz. with the casting of Christs
gouernment, and with the receiuing the yoke of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist.
To the first whereof, I answere, that if pastors,
Doctors and Elders, and Deacons be the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Christ, we haue it; in as much as the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
required in all these offices is retained with vs;
if these be abused by men, it is not sufficient to
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:244:69"/>
proue that we haue them not at all, if strife be about
the changing of the names, wise men will condemne
it for follie. To the second I answere, that her maie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stie
is supreame gouernesse ouer vs in all causes both
ecclesiasticall and ciuill; and therefore hath authoritie
to appoint such gouernors, to confirme that gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which (being not contrarie vnto Gods word)
shall seeme meete vnto hir. Nowe this gouernement
which we haue, else where is shewed to haue bene
for the preseruation of discipline and auoiding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion,
before the time that Antichrist bare sway in
the church. I grant that afterward he abused it, so did
he many other matters: and yet they are not to be
counted Antichristian (hauing not their beginning of
him) when they are restored vnto their first vse. But
this one calumniation bringeth foorth these fruites:
First, in teaching that euery priuat man hath autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in the election of ecclesiasticall gouernors, or else
the gouernement is Antichristian, the priuat man is
taught to intrude into her highnesse right, to whome
this matter was granted by Act of Parlement, 1. Eliz.

                  <p>The Argument is thus.</p>
                  <p>The true church receiueth Christ as their Priest,
but the church of England doth not, because it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneth
his name, &amp;c. Therefore no true church.</p>
                  <p>The assumtion is false, for the doctrin of our church
is, that Christ is the onely Priest, who by his owne
blood entred in once into the holy place, and obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
eternall redemption for vs? and therefore that
men should walke worthy of so holy a calling as
Christ hath vouchsafed to set them in; neither in their
worshipping of God, prophaning his name; not by
their vngodlinesse abusing his sacraments, wherein
the practise by our church commanded is, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
&amp; vngodly men be repelled from the same. It
is not therfore a matter to be generally laid vnto the
charge of the whole church, that they prophane his
name, &amp;c. I grant indeed that the Pastor may thorow
ignorance, negligence, or some other euill occasion
deliuer the sactament to an vnworthy man, which as
it is a sinne in the receiuer, so may it be as great a sinne
in the deliuerer, yet will this be a weake reason to
conuince the whole church of prostituting the blood
of Christ, denying his priesthood, prophaning his
name, &amp;c. seing that Iudas was partaker of the supper
of the Lord, and yet the whole companie were not
polluted thereby.</p>

                  <p>The Argument is this.</p>
                  <p>The true church receiueth Christ as her prophet,
but the church of England doth not, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The assumption of which argument they proue
thus. First, because the church of England giueth no
obedience to his word. Secondly, because they vse it
as a mantle to couer their sinne: and thirdlie because
they seeke not a true ministerie but maintaine a false.</p>
                  <p>It hath heretofore bene granted, that the best chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
haue had some bad members in them, whereof
some in Athiesme despised the word, &amp; others in hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie
made it a cloake to couer their vngodlinesse,
wherein the church of England goeth not scotfree;
but for the wickednes of some to condeme the whole
were verie hard; and so sharpely to censure all, were
intollerable. Yet these men do it, when they affirme
that no obedience is giuen to the word: as if all from
the highest to the lowest were infidels and pagans,
without God, without the knowledge of his word,
without conscience in any thing, without the feare of
God. This is the meeknesse of an arrogant spirit. The
bull sent by Pope Pius the fift to cursse her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie
&amp; the land, was not vnlike vnto it; the calumni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
is the same in both, and therefore master Iewell
hath framed an answere meete for both.</p>
                  <p>Now as touching our ministery which is set as the
third argument of our disobedience; the defects ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
are noted to be either in their election, or in their
subiection to a false gouernement. <hi>Their election and
ordination</hi> (say they) <hi>are not by the Lords holy and free
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:244:70"/>

not made their owne ministers in <hi>tenebris,</hi> they might
with lesse impudencie haue blamed the making of
ours.<note place="margin">Confer. with Spering.</note> Besides they say, that <hi>at her maiesties entrance
vnto the crowne our ministers were set ouer the people
without an outvvard calling.</hi> Wherein I will not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the ministerie of Luther and Caluin, whose mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie

of their booke, and yet they had not a better calling
then our men had; but I dare auouch the calling of
our men vnto the ministerie at the entring in of her
maiestie vnto the crowne, to be the selfe same that
euen our aduersaries haue warranted, pag. 59. of the
aforesaid treatise, viz. the magistrate did send them
to instruct the vnbeleeuers: but (say they) <hi>they vvere
no ministers vnto them.</hi> Then let them tell vs what
other ministerie this might be, and what warrant
they haue for it in the word, or else they giue vs iust
cause to complaine that they are filled with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceites.</p>
                  <p>Now the gouernement vnder the which they exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
their ministerie is such,<note place="margin">Instit. lib. 4. sect. 4.</note> that master Caluin ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth

an end with this Argument, notwithstanding all
the exceptions afore said, the Church of England
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:244:71"/>
acknowledgeth Christ as their Prophet, and for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science

                  <p>In the proposition I finde these absurdlties, first
that the visible church is tyed to be all of one assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie
or congregation, in which respect the diuision of
our church into seuerall parishes, is an eye-sore vnto
them. Secondly, that the inordinate proceedings of
some in the church, should proue a nullitie of the
church; as if the losse or vnsoundnesse of a member
could take away the <hi>esse</hi> from the bodie. Thirdly, that
the spiritual vnion of the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber in the whole church
is so required in euerie seuerall assemblie, as if it were
as great a sin for a man to depart from one assemblie
vnto another, as to dismember himselfe altogither
from the whole bodie, which is the church. Al which
are so grosse, that a censurer doth better become
them, then a confuter.</p>
                  <p>As for our church the disorders therein are too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,

                  <p>The argument is this.</p>
                  <p>The true church is ordered by such officers and
and lawes, as Christ in his last wil and testament hath
thereunto ordained. But the church of England is not
ordered thus, Therefore &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The first argument hath beene infringed pag. 25.
where it was proued that outwarde discipline is not
the life of the church, also pag. 26. &amp; 70. where it was
shewed that doctors &amp; widdows were not necessarie
in euery congregation. Wherunto I adde this, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
a gouernement by elders, &amp;c. was established
in some churches in the Apostles times, yet as pag.
62. hath beene said, it remaineth as yet vnproued,
that this gouernement is to remaine vnchangeable in
all ages: they tell vs that Christ was as faithfull in his
house as Moses was, I grant it, yea and more faithfull.
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:244:72"/>
Therfore (say they) he hath set downe an outward go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement
as well as Moses did. This also will I grant
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet remaineth a third matter, viz. that the Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistes
cast their heades together againe, and describe
this gouernement better then as yet they haue done,
and proue out of Gods word not onely what it is, but
that it is necessarily to be had in al ages alike, yea and
that the want of it doth conuince a people to be no
true church vnto God. All which being once perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
their proposition shall be granted.</p>
                  <p>The second part of this argument is confirmed by
these foure circumstances that wee haue no true pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,
whereof hath bene spoken very oft.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that the gouernement by Archbishops
&amp;c. is antichristian. A matter answered pag. 110. but
in affirming our gouernement to be in the power of
proctors, aduocates, notaries, registers, pursuiuants,
summoners, &amp;c. whom these euill tongued men, doe
know to haue no authority in hearing of causes &amp; gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
sentence, bewraieth the corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their harts.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that our ministery is antichristian a matter
handled, pag. 125. the scurrilitie in calling them hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
mercenary preachers, &amp;c. deserueth no answer;
the names of parson, vicar, &amp;c. doth not make a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
in the ministery, but in their maintenance.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, we are subiect to the popish courtes, as
high commission &amp;c. wherunto I answer that al these
courts haue their authority from her maiesty, though
some of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more directly then the other. In conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
wherof, to call the lest antichristian is arrogant,
but to ioine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all in one sentence, &amp; to disswade her
maiesties subiects fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> yeelding obedience vnto any of
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it will be found an act of no good subiect: yet for
mine owne parte I purpose not to giue iudgement in
the matter, I leaue it to such as are acquainted with
the law, onely I will propound the case, which is this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="135" facs="tcp:244:72"/>
The high court of Parlement hath agreed that the
queene, her hignes &amp; successors, kings &amp; queenes of
this realme, shall haue full power by letters pattents
vnder the great seale, to name and authorise when, as
often, and for so long time as her highnes, her heires
or successors shall thinke meete such person or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons

                  <p>Now her maiestie by the authoritie aforesaid
hath graunted her letters pattentes vnder the great

And by the said authority first from the Parle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

doe stande, and not by any other right or authoritie
whatsoeuer: yet these two courts of high commission

fall out, that euerie member hath that freedom which

                  <p>The proposition faileth, for the true church is
sometimes without outward gouernement, whereof
read pag. 25. and so consequently without the power
which this man speaketh off, for I know he will not
restraine this power of binding and loosing though
he might, vnto the ministerie of the word, whereof
notwithstanding Christ speaketh, Ioh. 20. 23. saying
<hi>Whose sinnes soeuer ye remit, they are remitted, and whose
sinnes ye retaine they are retained.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the assumption it is most vntrue; for we
haue not onely the power of Gods word, which he
hath giuen vnto his ministerie to bind and to loose
therby, but also the censures of the church in respect
of outward gouernement. I grant that euerie seuerall
congregation hath not this power: and I dare af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme

the end wherefore men are cast out from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
vs by the doctrine of our church should be,
that the offender by being depriued of the seales of

humour, it hath bene often answered. Some defectes
there are in our gouernment, we challenge no perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
some corruption there is oftentimes in such as
haue the ordering of it, I defend not all. But in this I
would be resolued, if wee by the power of Satan cast
out Satan, by what power do they cast out Satan, that
are themselues by your children committed to Satan?
For the most corrupt excommunicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in our church
shuld be wronged, if it should be compared with the
excommunications that come from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who by their
fellowes were before excommunicated in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
Nay, they are to bee iustified in comparison of
the best proceedings that haue beene amongst these
rash censurers.</p>

                  <p>Infinite vvere the reasons which from these seuerall
heads, as likevise from these particular transgressions and
defaults might be dravven: but the best argument to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and cut vp this trumperie at once, is according to the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:244:74"/>
commandements of God, to preserue our bodies and soules
free from these abhominations, by a speedie separation &amp;
wvithdravving our selues from amongest them, and to
confute their last and onely argument vvhereby they vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde
their ruinous kingdome, namelie, their penall lavve,
by Christian patience, and an vpright and godly life.</p>
                  <p>The conclusion is, that much more might bee sayde
against our Church: and I beleeue it if the matter had
not failed, for the author was willing vnto it, as may
appere by his making many arguments of that which
with as great credit might haue bene knit vp in one:
and also by his bitternesse from the first to the last.
Well, his modestie is great in that he staieth here, and
his dealing is as commendable in arming himself with
patience against the penall law, which he calleth our
onely argument. But what is the reason that hee so
speaketh? It should seeme, it is because hee had sent
these foresayd arguments to some learned men, who
would not vouchsafe to ansvvere them; but his chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging
of the learned is ridiculous, they are ashamed
to deale with so sottish a schisme as this is. In deede
the ciuill lawe is the fittest argument to be vsed with
these vnreasonable men. Yet other argumentes are
vsed both against the treatise of their Church, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their other follies, if they wil perseuer, lest their
disciples do condemne them for seducers, I wish them
to laie aside their former bitternes, &amp; to deal strictlie
with the matter in question. Many that are far inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
to those who haue ben challenged, will be found
able (I doubt not) to ouerthrow their buildings, and
to proue them deceitfull workmen.</p>
