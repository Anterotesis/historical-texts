            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <hi>by this</hi> Idea, <hi>and so fitly limited thereby, that it is in truth a bridle to the tongues and lips of such as, not knowing what is truly</hi> Antichristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <hi>and what not, in every pettish mood call any thing so in Religion that does not suit with their own humour and phancy. Besides, this Treatise being written in the way of an</hi> Idea, <hi>that is to say, being an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract Description or Delineation of the nature of</hi> Antichristianism, <hi>without any application thereof to any person or persons whatsoever; what Rudeness, Incivility or Uncharitableness can this design carry along with it, unless it can be thought rude or uncivil to define Vices</hi> in abstracto, <hi>and describe them in their Parts and Objects, and in what-ever Circumstances make to the clear and perfect knowledge of them? provided it be done faithfully and skilfully. And truly, that I have not falsified anything in this my Description of</hi> Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianism, <hi>I dare with confidence appeal to the judgment of any able and unprejudiced peruser thereof. But what I have set down for</hi> Antichristian, <hi>is such of its own nature, whether it be called so or no. Which accuracy if all would imitate, nothing would tend more to the peace of Christendom, and the steddy and firm promotion of</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testantism <hi>in every Nation.</hi>

In answer to which, I must ingenuously confess that the Title of my Discourse for this very reason may justly seem less plausible. But it is the true and proper Name of the matter which I handle, to which onely if these ruder people had been taught to appropriate the Term, it could never have contracted any such nauseous prejudice as it seems to have done. And I hope I am at least excusable, if not thank-worthy, in that I have taken pains to teach them the due and proper use thereof.</hi>

Be it that thou thy self scarce believest that there is a God, much less any thing to come after this Life; and therefore hast a Conscience free to any Religion, be it never so wicked or foolish, and canst laugh at the imperious Impostures of the Priest, when thou hast done. But canst thou be assured that thy Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren will be such, that the Wife of thy bosome will continue such, if she be so for the present? Canst thou promise for thy most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Friend, which is as dear to thee as thy self? nay, canst thou promise for thy self, that God may not so powerfully strike thy Conscience some time or other, as to convert thee to the true knowledge of himself and of his Son</hi> Jesus? <hi>Now I tell thee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendiously and at once, That the Contexture of this</hi> Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianism <hi>which I oppose is a mere Train or Net laid or spread for the Life of thy self, thy Friend, thy Wife and Children.

But I do not remember that the hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test pursuers after this strange Beast, no not they that had thought they had found him and taken him, have left so perfect and essential a Description of his nature prescinded from external circumstanc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <p>But such imperfect and indistinct representations as these tend to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the raising mens passions against things that are in themselves innocent, and the conniving at those that are truly vicious and hurtfull. As if, for example, a man should declare in gross the <hi>Turk</hi> Antichrist, or the <hi>Pope;</hi> not expressing what it was that did really constitute them such: The effect thereof would only be this, namely, without any further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination to congratulate our selves that we are neither <hi>Turks</hi> nor <hi>Papists,</hi> (though we may really have no small measure of the <hi>Mystery of Iniquity</hi> in us for all that) and to take offence at the sight of a Turbant, a Crosier or a Miter (or other things that have as little, or less hurt, if it be possible, then these) because they are found amongst the <hi>Turks</hi> or <hi>Papists.</hi> And yet methinks the most furious Reformers should not have so little wit in their wrath, as to think the Reformation incomplete, till with Mattocks and Spades they have dug down <hi>the seven Hills at Rome,</hi> and flung the earth with shovels towards the four winds of Heaven; for all that seems the most obvious circumstantial Characteristick of the <hi>Whore of Babylon</hi> (be that <hi>Whore</hi> who she will) that is to be found in the Scripture.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. We see it therefore very requisite, that we may not quarrel with shadows, to seek out and propose such a Delineation of <hi>Antichristianism,</hi> as may let goe innocuous circumstances, and take in what is truely and essentially <hi>Antichristian;</hi> nor make any thing a part of the <hi>Mystery of Iniquity</hi> that has not any iniquity in it; as we cannot well any confessed Wickedness, but as it is the effect of some pretended Holiness. In these two things therefore in general does this <hi>Mystery of Iniquity</hi> or <hi>Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianism</hi> consist. First, <hi>In the instituting of such Laws, or autoritative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teaching such Doctrines, and promoting or commanding such Practices, as naturally defeat and frustrate the true scope and purpose of the Gospel of Christ.</hi> And then Secondly, <hi>In the doing this with such artifice and so fair pretences, that they bear the world in hand in the mean time that they are doing the work of God, and promoting the Interest of the Kingdom of his Son Jesus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This, I say, in general is the very Nature and Essence of <hi>Antichristianism:</hi> And where this poison is imbibed into publick Authority; that either one

Person, or Body politick, or jointly both of them together, if they be the first beginners or continuers of this <hi>Mystery of Iniquity,</hi> in a due latitude thereof, are assuredly <hi>that Antichrist</hi> there is such a noise of in the Christian world. And for others that have it not in such a measure, yet so far forth as they are Teachers, Abetters, or Obtruders of such Practices or Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples upon pretence of Religion, as naturally frustrate the End of the coming of Christ, they are so far also <hi>Antichristian.</hi>

                        <p n="1">1. <hi>THat God intended the rooting out of Idolatry by sending Christ into the World;</hi> appears as well by those Prophecies of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that foretel that <hi>all Idolatry shall be rooted out</hi> (for by whom should it be done but by the <hi>Messias,</hi> in whom all the nations of the earth should be blessed:) as by several passages in the New.</p>
                        <p>Of the first sort is that in <hi>Jeremie</hi> chap. 10. where the Prophet puts this prophecy in the mouths of the Jews that were carried captive into <hi>Babylon: Thus shall ye say unto them,</hi> (saith he) <hi>The Gods that made not the Heavens and the Earth, they shall perish from the Earth and from under the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens.</hi> But the preceding context is so lively and magnificent, and so close to our purpose, that it ought not to have been omitted. At the seventh verse
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42932:9"/>
therefore, <hi>Who would not fear thee, O King of Nations? for to thee doth it appertain: Forasmuch as among all the wise men of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and in all their Kingdoms, there is none like unto thee. But they are altogether brutish and foolish; the stock is a Doctrine of vanities. Silver spred into plates is brought from Tarshish, and Gold from Uphas, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the Founder; Blue and purple is their cloathing, they are all the work of cunning men. But the Lord is the true God, he is the living God and an everlasting King: At his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the Nations shall not be able to abide his indignation.</hi> And then follows this Prophetick denunciation against every undue object of Divine worship; <hi>Thus shall ye say unto them, The Gods that made not the Heavens and the Earth, they shall perish from the Earth and from under these Heavens.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. Things are exceeding clear in this Prophecy, saving in that comparison of the <hi>King of Nations</hi> with the <hi>wise men of the Nations,</hi> betwixt whom there is that infinite disparity, that the collation seems hugely improper if the <hi>pure Deity</hi> be here conceived to be compared with any <hi>wise men</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever. <hi>Grotius</hi> therefore ingeniously hinteth, that it is meant of some of the <hi>wise men of the Nations</hi> that had been translated into the number of their Gods, as <hi>Taautes</hi> for example: which a little helps out one terme of the comparison, these <hi>wise men</hi> being supposed to have been advanced to Divine honours after their death, and to have been reckoned amongst the Gods.</p>
                        <p>But I must confess even that in the 86 Psalm, <hi>Among the Gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord, there is none that can doe as thou doest,</hi> has often puzzel'd me, that the Prophet should vouchsafe to compare the Gods of the Nations, which were but Deified Mortals, or at best but particular Angels, or Daemons in that higher sense, with the pure, infinite, and omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent Deity: which has made me often suspect that such passages as these are to be understood of the <hi>Messias,</hi> who was also to be incarnated and to become the true <gap reason="foreign">

                           <hi>the Earth, and the Heavens are the work of thy hands.</hi> Which is spoke of the <hi>Messias,</hi> his time being there so plainly decyphered, as appears in the 22 verse, <hi>When the people are gathered together, and the Kingdoms to serve the Lord.</hi> Whence that is also plain, that Christ shall be ever <hi>the same,</hi> and that <hi>his years shall have no end;</hi> and that this Prophetick denunciation, <hi>The Gods that made not Heaven and Earth, shall perish from</hi>

The same Apostle also at <hi>Athens,</hi> in his Speech he made to them on <hi>Mars-hill,</hi> reads them a very round lesson against Idolatry. <hi>Forasmuch then as we are the off-spring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto Gold or Silver or Stone graven by art and mans device.

                        <p>Wherefore as Christ is said to be <hi>Head of all Principalities and Powers,</hi> though God the Father be also rightly so styled; and Christ is likewise said to be the <hi>Head of the Church,</hi> though no man can deny but that God is so also; for he that is an <hi>Husband</hi> to his Church, is also <hi>ipso facto</hi> the <hi>Head</hi> of her: So Christ in like manner may rightly be termed <hi>the Father of his Church,</hi> although that be the ordinary appellation of the <hi>First Hypostasis</hi> of the holy Trinity. And therefore there being such a real respect of <hi>Paternity</hi> betwixt Christ and his Church laid in this so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable ground of Regeneration by his Spirit into a new Creature, I thought it both allowable and usefull to take notice thereof, and adde this

                        <p n="4">4. That Christ is <hi>our King, Priest, Prophet,</hi> and <hi>our God,</hi> are Truths so generally acknowledged, and so exceeding plain, that I need produce no proof either of the things themselves, or of the fitness of the Phrase.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p n="1">1. LET us begin then with the delineation of the first member of this hideous Mystery, opposite to the first branch of the Scope of the Gospel of Christ, which was <hi>The ridding of the world of the impure worship of Idolatry.</hi> I say therefore, if in stead of those manifold <hi>Idolatrous worships</hi> in Paganism there were introduced (upon pretence of the greater honour to God and Christ, and the better instruction of the people) the Religious worship of the Cross, as also the Image of God the Father, Son, or Holy Ghost; the devotional invocation of the blessed Virgin, or any other Saints, or Angels; the worshipping of their Pictures, or Images; and the doing Divine honours (accordingly as it was practised toward
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42932:13"/>
the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours) to a mere man upon account of his being the <hi>Vicar General of Christ</hi> and <hi>Oecumenical Head of his Church upon Earth;</hi> and lastly, the adoration of the consecrated Bread in the Eucharist upon the imagination that it is <hi>transsubstantiated</hi> into the very body of Christ: I say, where these things are brought into the Church as true Doctrine and laudable Practice, they will not fail to make up one Limb of <hi>Antichristia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism,</hi> and that a principal one too.</p>
                        <p>For the Doctrine is not true nor the Practice allowable, but gross and palpable <hi>Idolatry,</hi> (one of the most abhorred sins the Scripture takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of;) as you shall easily understand after I have with all possible caution searcht out the true Notion and definitive nature thereof.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. This term <hi>Idolatry,</hi> though nothing is more frequent in the mouths and writings of men, yet there is nothing of so unsettled and fugitive a signification. For some, to excuse or palliate their grosly-disallowable Rites and Practices in Christian Religion, have restrained the sense of the word to such narrow limits, that according to their nice distinctions and restrictions the foulest Paganism will scarce be found guilty of <hi>Idolatry.</hi> Others, whether out of a fright and abhorrency of so detestable a crime, or out of an over-factious disgust and detestation of the contrary party, have so stretched the signification of the word beyond the natural meaning thereof, that not only harmless, but even laudable circumstances of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worship appointed by Authority will not fail to be stigmatized by them with that odious and reproachful name: whose zeal and passionate unskilfulness in amoving this grand errour out of the Church has had an answerable ill success, in that they have not so much wrought a cure, as changed the disease, and bartered away one great evil for several others of something a lower form; such as <hi>Scandal,</hi> rash and <hi>unjust Censure,</hi> and <hi>Superstition;</hi> which are very evil and undesirable distempers in the Church of Christ, and the necessary Authours and Fomenters of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary Schisms. And indeed if I had said only, that they had changed <hi>Idolatry</hi> into <hi>Superstition,</hi> it had been enough, and all, it including the rest. For <hi>Superstition</hi> being properly a Fear of displeasing God in such things as neither do oblige him nor offend him, arising out of an opinion of the good or evil of those things that are indifferent; Those that either out of ignorance, or some worse principle, ingender in the minds of men a superstitious aversation from such harmless and allowable actions, must needs make them obnoxious to <hi>Scandal,</hi> and tempt them to <hi>rash and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just Censures.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. Wherefore as well to excuse the innocent, as to discover the guilty, I shall endeavour exactly to set out the bounds of this great sin of <hi>Idolatry;</hi> that thereby we may know when it is committed, and when not; when it may be called by that so hatefull name, and when again it is Injustice and Uncharitableness so to term this or that action of Religious worship.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. That the name or guilt of <hi>Idolatry</hi> is not to be restrained to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of an <hi>Idol</hi> only, is plain out of ordinary consent of Speech, when we discourse of <hi>Idolatrous</hi> Nations that worship the <hi>Sun, Moon</hi> and <hi>Stars;</hi> not considering whether they make any <hi>Images</hi> to them or no. For these <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p n="5">5.

                        </argument>
                        <p n="1">1. THat which seems more seasonable to inquire into is this, <hi>Whether as there is Idolatry without the worshipping of Images; so there may not be the worshipping of Images without Idolatry, the Images being worshipped in reference to the true God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>That to worship the true God by an Image, is Idolatry,</hi> I conceive is very plain from the children of <hi>Israel</hi>'s worshipping him by the <hi>Golden Calf</hi> which <hi>Aaron</hi> made. For first, that they worshipped God by this <hi>Calf,</hi> is evident from what is written <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 4. where it is proclaimed, <hi>These be thy Gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the Land of Aegypt:</hi> And verse 8. God there telling <hi>Moses</hi> what was done, <hi>They have</hi> (saith he) <hi>made them a molten Calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be thy Gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the Land of Aegypt.</hi> But it is manifest that <hi>this Calf</hi> did not bring them out of the Land of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> but they brought it, I mean the materials of it: and that therefore they understood it only as a visible Image and Representation of the presence of him that did bring them out thence, namely of Jehovah the true God.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Nor is there any scruple to be made from the pronouncing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in the plural number, as if that <hi>One true God</hi> could not be meant there: For <hi>Elohim</hi> is not only as fitly said of one single Deity as of one single Image, but is really, and that frequently, said of this One God Jehovah. And <hi>Nehemiah</hi> reciting this passage, shews plainly that the sense is to be <note place="margin">ch. 9. v. 18.</note> understood of one; he reading, not, <hi>These are thy Gods,</hi> but, <hi>This is thy God, that brought thee up out of Aegypt.</hi> Nor does the verb being in the plural number make any infringement to this Truth. For <gap reason="foreign">

                           <hi>of Calves:</hi> which is no obscure intimation that <hi>Aaron</hi>'s act was not so extravagant as it seems at first sight, he erecting such a Symbol of the Divine presence as was to be afterward reposited in the Ark, namely, the figure of a <hi>Cherub,</hi> or Golden <hi>Calf:</hi> But to conceit that so holy a man as <hi>Aaron</hi> proposed to them the worship of the Aegyptian <hi>Apis,</hi> and made them an Idol of an Idol, to celebrate a Festival to <hi>Jehovah</hi> by it; is a thing so impious, incoherent and exorbitant, that it seems utterly incredible.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Wherefore in brief the case seems to stand thus. God having by <hi>Moses</hi> promised to his people his visible presence to conduct them into the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> which Symbolical presence was to be in the <hi>Ark,</hi> and especially in the <hi>Cherubim,</hi> on which he was seen to sit by <hi>Aaron</hi> when he was admitted into the sight of God in the Mount: He being therefore privy to the design of this manner of representing the presence of God by <hi>Cherubims</hi> or <hi>Golden Calves,</hi> and <hi>Moses</hi> having staid so long in the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:42932:15"/>
Mount, that both <hi>Aaron</hi> and the people took it for granted that he was dead; they requiring of him that he should make good that promise of the sensible presence of God, to make Gods to conduct them to <hi>Canaan,</hi> or at least back again to <hi>Aegypt,</hi> that they might not be lost and perish in a barren wilderness; he thought fit in this exigency of affairs to erect that Symbol of the Divine presence which was intended by <hi>Moses,</hi> and so made this <hi>Cherub</hi> in the form of a <hi>Calf,</hi> both out of skill and integrity. But it was the vainness and wickedness of the people to turn it into an <hi>Idol</hi> by worshipping it, and so to <hi>Aegyptianize</hi> in the adoration of the God of <hi>Israel.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Which he endeavoured as wisely as he could to prevent, in chusing this form rather then that of an <hi>Eagle, Lion,</hi> or <hi>Man;</hi> as being the least alluring to Religious worship: which was the reason of <hi>Moses</hi> his choice also, who is thought to have made both the <hi>Cherubims</hi> in this shape. And that idle mistake of <hi>Tacitus</hi> and others, <hi>of the Jews worshipping the head of an Asse,</hi> may probably be grounded upon the seeming vility of these <hi>figures;</hi> as being little superiour to those slow creatures: And therefore the more unlikely, say I, of ever being intended for Objects of worship, as certainly they were not, but only for Symbolical Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the Chariot of God and of his visible appearance to the Prophets. Which Visions themselves I do not doubt but were a figure or symbol of some very noble and substantial Truths, which would be too long here to dive into.</p>
                        <p>To this purpose <hi>Moncaeus</hi> argues in his Treatise of the subject, where he pursues the matter more copiously: which, if a man duely consider, he cannot imagine but the worship given to the <hi>Golden Calf</hi> was not intended for the Aegyptian <hi>Apis</hi> or any other forein Deity, but for <hi>Jehovah</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the Lord of <hi>Israel.</hi>

                        <p n="5">5. And there is the same reason assuredly of the <hi>Golden Calves</hi> in <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel</hi> which <hi>Jeroboam</hi> set up, which will both give light to and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive light from this of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and joyntly prove that they were both such <hi>Cherubims</hi> as were in the <hi>Ark of the Covenant,</hi> and that the Sacrifices and Solemnities of the people were intended to <hi>Jehovah:</hi> As it appears from the first of Kings Chap. 12. where it is plain that it was a fetch of <note place="margin">V. 26, 27, 28.</note> policy in <hi>Jeroboam</hi> to set up those <hi>Cherubims</hi> or <hi>Golden Calves</hi> in <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> for to keep the ten Tribes from revolting to <hi>Rehoboam</hi> King of <hi>Juda,</hi> by their going up to doe sacrifice in the house of the Lord at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem.

For could he hope so in a moment to take off their devotion from the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> whom they had so long served, even from their childhood; and so stop their going to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> at their set times of Solemnities? Surely no: But his meaning was, that they might serve the same God here at home, and save themselves the labour of such tedious journeys; and to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:42932:16"/>
he had set up two <hi>Golden Cherubs,</hi> the acknowledged Symbols of his presence, the one in <hi>Dan,</hi> the other in <hi>Bethel,</hi> before which they might meet, and sacrifice, and perform their anniversary Solemnities to the God of <hi>Israel</hi> as well as if they went to <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">6. And hence it is that when the worship of <hi>Baal</hi> and that of these <hi>Golden Calves</hi> came into competition, these latter worshippers are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the Servants of the Lord.</hi> And <hi>Jehu</hi> professes his zeal against <hi>Baal</hi>'s <note place="margin">2 Kings 10. 23.</note> Priests to be in the behalf of Jehovah, though he never ceased to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship the Golden Calves. <hi>Elias</hi> also abets the Tribes of <hi>Israel</hi> against such of them as were turned worshippers of <hi>Baal,</hi> as allowing them to be worshippers of the true God, though the Israelitish mode of worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping him at that time was in those Golden Calves. <hi>If the Lord be God, follow him; if Baal be God, follow him.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And when the <hi>Assyrian</hi> Colonies were worried with Lions in <hi>Samaria,</hi> it is imputed to their ignorance of the worship of the God of the place, <note place="margin">2 Kings 17. 26, 27.</note> who was known to be Jehovah; and it was an Israelitish Priest that was sent back to teach them, who dwelt in <hi>Bethel,</hi> and taught them certainly after the manner of <hi>Israel</hi> to worship him in those <hi>Golden Cherubims,</hi> as they did from <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s time to that very day. So little doubt is there but that <hi>Jehovah</hi> was worshipped in those <hi>Calves of Gold.</hi>

                        <p n="7">7. A like Instance to which I conceive is discoverable in more early times. As in that of <hi>Micah</hi>'s <hi>Ephod</hi> and <hi>Teraphim,</hi> and his consecrated Son, and devout Mother that had dedicated such a summe of silver to the <note place="margin">Judg. 17.</note> Lord, of which an <hi>Image</hi> was made by the founder: His eager enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a Levite also, in stead of his Son whom he had consecrated to the Lord, and his blessing himself for his good hap in lighting on this Levite, saying, <hi>Now know I that the Lord will doe me good, seeing I have a Levite to my Priest.</hi> All this shews plainly that these <hi>Teraphim</hi> were consulted <note place="margin">V. 13.</note> as the Oracle of the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> I mean as the Oracle of Jehovah: And the mention of the <hi>Ephod</hi> would easily induce one to believe that the <hi>Teraphim</hi> were, as S. <hi>Jerom</hi> conceits of them, in the form of the <hi>Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims.</hi> And this therefore was the worshipping of Jehovah by a bare I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and is a second undeniable Instance of this kind of unlawfull worship.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. For that this Religion of <hi>Micah</hi> was unlawfull, is intimated in that <hi>Epiphonema</hi> immediately subjoyned to the mention of his <hi>house of Gods,</hi> and <hi>Ephod,</hi> and <hi>Teraphim. In those days there was no King in Israel,</hi>

                           <hi>but every one did that which was right in his own eyes.</hi> But to make short work. Either these <hi>Teraphim</hi> and Images were like the <hi>Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims</hi> which <hi>Moses</hi> made, or they were other prophane Idols: If the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, the <hi>Idolatry</hi> is so conspicuous we need pursue the proof thereof no further: If the first, we shall yet prove that to be down-right <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and thereby evince the second to be much more.</p>
                        <p>That the worshipping the <hi>Golden Calf</hi> in <hi>Horeb</hi> was <hi>Idolatry,</hi> though the worship was intended to <hi>Jehovah,</hi> is plain, both from that height of wrath and displeasure that God conceived against them for worshipping and sacrificing to the molten Image; <hi>Let me alone,</hi> saith God, <hi>that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them:</hi> and also <note place="margin">Exod 32. 10.</note> from <hi>Moses</hi> his being so transported into passion at the sight of the thing,

                           <p>1. The worshipping that which is not God by an Image, a third mode of Idolatry. 2. Of the worshipping of an <hi>Image</hi> as such. 3. How the vulgar sort of the Heathen came to take the very <hi>Idols</hi> themselves for Gods. 4. What arguments used for the begetting an opinion of the residence of the Daemons near their Statues. 5. What indications of their presence there, and how awfull the Images themselves became from thence. 6. The conceit of the Daemon and dedicated Image's coalition into one person. 7. And that the worshipping of this <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate</hi> was a fourth Mode of Idolatry.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p n="1">1. THus we have demonstrated <hi>two Modes</hi> or <hi>Manners of Idolatry;</hi> namely, <hi>The worshipping of that which is not God without an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,</hi> and <hi>The worshipping of the true God with one.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>From whence the evincement of a <hi>third Mode</hi> will follow, viz. <hi>That the worshipping of that which is not God by an Image, is Idolatry;</hi> nay, I may say, <hi>a double-charged Idolatry.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For if to give Divine worship to each apart be <hi>Idolatry;</hi> to worship both these unlawfull Objects at once is <hi>double Idolatry.</hi> And if the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the external Object of worship to the true God makes not that Object lawfull, no not when it pretends not to be the Shape or Image of the true God, (as certainly the <hi>Golden Calf</hi> did not pretend it, nor any one think it) then surely a false God cannot make an <hi>Image</hi> an Object of lawfull worship, no not though it were like it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Nor can any <hi>Image</hi> of it self without reference to some other thing be a due Object of worship. For as the true God is rightly by the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist styled <gap reason="foreign">

                           <hi>the merest Nothing of all Nothings,</hi> the vainest of all Vanities, that can be proposed to be worshipped religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously. From which consideration arises <hi>another sort of Idolatry,</hi> which is <hi>The worshipping of an Image absolutely, without reference to any thing else,</hi> (which would be <hi>Idolatry</hi> in the strictest sense, according to the nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the word) if it were practicable. For it seems very hard to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship an <hi>Image,</hi> we knowing it to be so, merely in reference to it self; the very nature of an <hi>Image</hi> referring to something else.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. But men may possibly worship that which is but an <hi>Image,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reference to any other thing; the Garishness or Dreadfulness thereof strongly working upon the minds of the more simple to conceit some

strange Divinity in it, which is not. Which according to some passages in Scripture seems to be the condition of the Vulgar sort of the Heathen. As in Psalm 135. 15. and again in the 115. 4. <gap reason="foreign">

                           <hi>Dolores</hi> or <hi>Terricula Gentium, The Fear and Awe of the Gentiles</hi> (that is, their Gods) <hi>are but Images of silver and gold,</hi> &amp;c. which <hi>Images</hi> though they were the next way to bring all Religion into contempt amongst the more crafty and nasute, yet the Golden splendour and magnificency of them did, it seems, so perstringe the eyes of the simple sort, that they took them to be very Gods; as appears plainly out of these places of the <hi>Psalms,</hi> and very copiously out of the Epistle of <hi>Jeremie.</hi> Which cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure both of <hi>Jeremie</hi> and of the <hi>Psalmist</hi> is notwithstanding so to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, as not to engage us to think that the Heathen had no other Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of their worship but the very <hi>Idols</hi> themselves. For (as I have above intimated) in all likelihood these <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, these awfull Objects of their superstitious worship, were first the <hi>Daemons</hi> themselves; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Ghosts of the departed, or other Devils; who sometimes, though not so very frequently, have miraculously shown their presence in these Images or Statues; the fame whereof being continued, conciliated that superstitious reverence to these Idols from the Vulgar, as if they had been living and powerfull Deities.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. <hi>Origen</hi> speaks of the religation of these Daemons near their Statues, <note place="margin">Origen. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Cels. lib. 7.</note> whether by Magical incantation, or that, like so many smell-Feasts, they hankered near the Altars, to enjoy the nidorous fumes of the Sacrifices, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        </p>
                        <p>It is likely the imposing Priests would pretend either of these to the people (though not in that odious scheme) as persuasions of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Daemons themselves in these consecrated Places and Images. And truely the unctuous vapours from the burning of the Sacrifices seems a more suteable entertainment for them then the gross bloud: Which yet <note place="margin">Doct. perplex. part. 3. c. 40.</note> 
                           <hi>Maimonides</hi> says the <hi>Zabii</hi> conceived to be their repast, and therefore ate it themselves to communicate with them.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. But as appears by <hi>Origen,</hi> in his third book against <hi>Celsus,</hi> there were yet more evident demonstrations of the presence of these Daemons in their Temples and Statues, by rendring of Oracles, by healing of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases, and tormenting the superstitious if they transgressed in any punctilio of Religious service to them. These he calls <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, whom he intimates to be smart monitours to them that transgress, <note place="margin">Origen. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Cels. lib. 3.</note>

                           </gap>, <hi>to terrify the rude mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</hi> But whether these <hi>terrours</hi> were also by some frauds of the Priests, or merely from the peevishness of the Daemons, I will not here dispute. But questionless it struck a great dread into the simple people of the Images themselves, as if there were a Power and Divinity in them.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. But yet I am not come to what I was aiming at, which is, A conceit of so near an union of the <hi>Daemon</hi> and the <hi>Statue,</hi> as if they were one sacred Animal or Person. For such certainly the <hi>Tyrians</hi> thought the Statue of <hi>Apollo,</hi> who, by binding it with golden chains, conceived they tied
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:42932:18"/>
                           <hi>Apollo</hi> himself so fast to them, that he could not goe away. As the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians</hi> also seem to have presumed concerning the Image of <hi>Victory,</hi> who, by clipping her wings off, thought to keep the Goddess herself from flying from them.</p>
                        <p>Which opinion certain prodigious passages in these kind of Images might very well <hi>foment.</hi> As that in the Image of the God <hi>Adranus,</hi> who, when the <hi>Adranites</hi> were engaged in a warre, was seen to sweat copiously, as also to shake the top of his Spear; as <hi>Plutarch</hi> relates in the life of <hi>Timoleon.</hi> And <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 1. c. 8.</note> 
                           <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> also writes how the Statues of <hi>Juno Moneta</hi> and of <hi>Fortuna</hi> spoke; the one signifying her willingness to goe to <hi>Rome,</hi> the other approving the manner of her consecration; <hi>Ritè me matronae vidistis, ritéque dedicâstis.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Teraphim</hi> also of the Gentiles (which were made under a certain figure or constellation of the Heavens) were erected to receive answers from as Oracles, and in all likelihood are the <hi>Statuae animatae futuro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum consciae,</hi> which <hi>Trismegist</hi> speaks of in <hi>Asclepius,</hi> and of which kind of <hi>speaking Statues</hi> are sundry stories; but I have run out too far already.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. The case that emerges from the consideration of the occasions of the people's thinking these <hi>dedicated Statues</hi> or <hi>Images</hi> (whether it be from the fame of Truth, or mere conceit) to be real Deities, is this, <hi>Whether they can be said to be Idolatrous in giving Divine worship to them, not as to the Images of any thing else, but (according to their belief) as to true and living Gods.</hi> In which point I conceive there is very little difficulty. For if the worship of that which is not God, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the notion of a saving and living Deity, be not <hi>Idolatry,</hi> there will be none found Idolaters, but those that think they wipe their mouth cleanest of this Fornication, by pretending they worship not the Image for it self, but in reference to the Deity whose Image it is; but in the mean time give Religious worship to what is no Deity, but a dead Being.</p>
                        <p>But we have above proved, That the worshipping the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon</hi> or any <hi>Daemon,</hi> though without an Image, is Idolatry, (and I think there is no Christian that did ever stick to confess it;) wherefore the worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of an Image, or the <hi>Complicate of an Image and a Daemon actuating it,</hi> for a Deity, which is not the True and Only Godhead Almighty and Infinite, but a Finite Being and such as there may be many others besides, is without all peradventure down-right <hi>Idolatry,</hi> which we may observe to be a <hi>Fourth Mode</hi> thereof.</p>

                           <hi>Maximus Tyrius,</hi> both Heathens, do plainly profess that in their Images of Gold and Silver and Ivory they worshipped the most High God, the Maker and Conserver of all things. But I will not enter into any copious proof of this, the bare supposition serving my turn.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Let us therefore suppose that some Heathen Philosopher, who knew the true God of the Universe, but was not yet cleansed from the practice of Image-worship, should either himself believe, or at least for some ends best known to himself should fully perswade another, that there is some such mysterious Art as <hi>Proclus</hi> seems to glance at, in his short Treatise <hi>De Sacrificio &amp; Magia:</hi> where, upon this ground, That there is such a close concatenation of Terrestrial with Celestial, and of Celestial with Supercelestial Essences, as also such a particular respect or Harmonie of several of the one with several of the other, he would insinuate to us, That there is a secret method of framing a <hi>Magical Statue</hi> out of certain
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:42932:19"/>
choice materials; which Divine symbols rightly mingled, and adapted into a consecrated Image by some mysterious Priest or <hi>Magus,</hi> will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>unum tale quale Divinum existit secundùm essentiam,</hi> and therefore by power of cognation and similitude will not fail to fetch down <hi>Jupiter Olympius</hi> himself from his highest or inmost supercelestial throne, and make him vitally actuate this Divine Statue in such sort that the Statue and Divinity it self shall become one visible <hi>Jupiter.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. The Question now emerging from hence is, Whether if a simple soul, being struck by the confidence and canting of this imposturous <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician</hi> into a full belief that this Statue is become the visible, but the true and eternal God of Heaven and Earth, should therefore worship that Divine Complicate as is pretended, (though it be really a mere figment) for the true God, this act of worship be blameless and irreprehensible, or whether it constitute a <hi>Fifth</hi> Mode of Idolatry. For it may be said in his excuse, it was well meant, and that he intended his worship for the true God; which was not in the foregoing case. But, as I said before, if Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance will excuse from Idolatry, Philosophers will be the only men that will be found capable of that crime. And in the former case, though they had not so true a notion of God as is competible but to One, yet they thought they had lighted on a due Object of Religious worship, if that might plead their excuse. And he that, in this last case, had the right notion of the true God, yet misses the mark in application, and adores a mere Idol. And though it be in reference to the true God, I mean, really meant to him; yet to serve him in an Idol, is Idolatry; but to take an Idol to be him, far worse.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. In brief, the sinfulness of any Idolatry, towards God, consists chiefly, if not solely, in either a kind of <hi>Injustice to him,</hi> or <hi>Reproach of him,</hi> or both. Now I demand of any man whether it be not a greater <hi>Reproach</hi> to the true God to take a mere Idol to be him, then to apply that worship which we use to him (and which always falls infinitely short of him) unto that which is but an <hi>Idol:</hi> or whether it be not a lesser piece of <hi>Injustice</hi> to take that mite of honour (for all that we can doe is no more) which is due to God, and give it to an <hi>Idol,</hi> then to take God from himself, as it were, by taking that to be him which is so infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly debased below him. As it would be a greater piece of <hi>Injustice</hi> to steal a Prince out of his cradle, and leave a Changeling in the room, then to take away his mantle to wrap a Changeling in; and a far less <hi>Reproach</hi> to fit a Scepter and <hi>Tiara</hi> to the hand and head of <hi>Cyrus</hi> his Ape, and then doe the <hi>Persian</hi> reverence to him, then to take this Ape to be King <hi>Cyrus</hi> himself. For the other may be interpreted only a ridiculous excess of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect and homage unskilfully intended to the King himself in thus royally adorning and reverentially courting his Ape: But this latter the grossest and most sottish <hi>Reproach</hi> imaginable; namely, for want of a duely-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured <hi>Idea</hi> of a Royal Prince, not to distinguish so Heroical a personage as King <hi>Cyrus</hi> from an ordinary Ape or Monkey. And yet that My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious Statue above mentioned, into which the prestigious <hi>Magus</hi> or Pagan Priest would pretend to have vitally incorporated the true God of the Universe, any one will acknowledge to be more vile then these vilest
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42932:19"/>
of Animals. So plain is it that this <hi>Fifth case</hi> will constitute a <hi>Fifth</hi> Mode of Idolatry, and that a very rank one too.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. And these <hi>Five</hi> Instances of Idolatry shall serve our turn to have recourse to, as plain patterns of that so hainous a crime, there scarce being any case which is not reducible to these either directly, or analogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally. For the Religious worship of <hi>Rivers, Plants,</hi> or <hi>Animals,</hi> such as the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> worshipped, as they are natural things, are to be referred to the first <hi>Classis;</hi> as Representatives of a more hidden <hi>Numen,</hi> to the second. <hi>Pictures</hi> also to the second; and <hi>consecrated Pillars</hi> and <hi>Stones,</hi> suppose they have no Image on them, are to be referred to <hi>Statues,</hi> if Divine worship be done unto them: As that Stone which had only the <note place="margin">

                        <p n="6">6. And in brief, to hold you in no longer suspence, upon the view of all particulars, the common Notion or <hi>Idea of Idolatry</hi> does undoubtedly consist in this, namely, <hi>In the giving Religious or Divine worship to any thing that is not truely God;</hi> as certainly no Visible thing is, that either Nature or Art can exhibit. And therefore it is said in <hi>Deuteronomie,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Chap. 4. v. 12.</note> 
                           <hi>You heard a voice, but saw no similitude.</hi> According to which is that <hi>Dogma</hi> of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> which <hi>Plutarch</hi> notes in the life of <hi>Numa,</hi>

                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>. Which made <hi>Numa</hi> cast away all <hi>Images</hi> in Divine worship, but he erected a Temple that bore the similitude of the World, that great and august Temple of God, placing the <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

Which is a witness of an happy combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the profoundest skill in Nature and the purest Religion, in that Philosophy which was afterwards called <hi>Pythagorical,</hi> of any that ever could be found, out of the acknowledged Church of God, and may well amuse us from whence they had it, if not from thence.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. But then the purity of this Philosophy abated, when ever they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the <hi>worship of Angels.</hi> For the due Object of our worship is <hi>One,</hi> as well as Invisible: <hi>Hear, O Israel, the Lord thy God is One, and</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Deut. 6. 4.</note> 
                           <hi>there is no God besides him:</hi> of which the immediate consequence is, that he alone is to be worshipped; according as our Saviour Christ has also ratified it, <hi>Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him alone shalt thou</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Luk. 4. 8.</note> 
                           <hi>serve.</hi> And the Authour to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> arguing the Divinity of Christ, produces that in the Psalms, <hi>Let all the Angels of God worship him.</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Chap. 1. 6.</note> Which, if Religious worship were not due to that alone which is God, would not infer Christ's Divinity.</p>
                        <p>And lastly, even the very second Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> who were over-favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Images, did yet condemn the <hi>Arrians</hi> of Idolatry in holding Christ but a Creature, and not very God. And <hi>Nestorius</hi> was stigmatized with the odious style of <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> or <hi>Man-worshipper,</hi> in that he held Christ a mere Man. For both the <hi>Arrians</hi> and <hi>Nestorians</hi> held that Christ was to be worshipped, though he was but a Creature; which that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:42932:20"/>
Synod concluded absolute Idolatry, whether the worship be with an Image or without it. As also the Synod of <hi>Laodicea</hi> makes the <hi>praying to Angels</hi> Idolatry. And <hi>Epiphanius</hi> concerning the <hi>Persians,</hi> he says they abhor <hi>Images,</hi> and yet they worship <hi>Idols;</hi> meaning the <hi>Sun, Moon,</hi> and <hi>Fire. Gregory Nazianzen</hi> likewise (as I have above noted) places Idolatry simply <hi>in transferring that worship which is due to the Creatour, upon the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> according to which notion <hi>Aquinas</hi> also and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> define it. And, lastly, S. <hi>Jerome</hi> roundly affirms <hi>Idololatram factum esse, si quis tres Deos credit.</hi> See Dr. <hi>Rainolds, De Romanae Ecclesiae Idololatria.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>So plain is it that <hi>Idolatry</hi> is not confined to the worshipping of an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, <note place="margin">Lib. 2. cap. 9.</note> but to the admitting of more Objects of Divine worship then that one true God.

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:42932:20"/>
loss how to discern when our selves or any one else commits <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and when not.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. There are some who for the better palliating their unjustifiable practices have framed a smooth story; namely, That there are as many kinds of <hi>Honour</hi> or <hi>Worship</hi> as there are of <hi>Excellency;</hi> and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there being three kinds of <hi>Excellency, Divine, Humane,</hi> and a <hi>mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle betwixt Humane and Divine,</hi> as that Supernatural grace and glory of the <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi> there are also three kinds of Worship, <hi>Latria, Dulia,</hi> and <hi>Cultus civilis.</hi> But the distribution had had less fraud and better Logick in it, if it had been bipartite; for then would have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared more plainly what kind of Worship they mean by <hi>Dulia.</hi> For they will not have it <hi>Civil worship,</hi> in that it is a distinct member there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from. It remains therefore that it must be <hi>Religious worship,</hi> though they were afraid to speak out what they harbour in their breast. For indeed <hi>Religion,</hi> which in its prime and proper sense is nothing else but <hi>Cultus Numinis,</hi> belongs <hi>de jure</hi> only to the true God; and if it be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to any thing else, it is <hi>Idolatry</hi> or <hi>Superstition.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But if they would have dealt above-board, and like honest men and exact Logicians, they should have distributed <hi>Honour</hi> or <hi>Worship,</hi> first into <hi>Religious</hi> and <hi>Civil,</hi> and then, according to the sense that they inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, subdivided <hi>Religious worship</hi> into <hi>Latria</hi> and <hi>Dulia.</hi> But this being craftily aimed at and supposed, though not so plainly expressed, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed being the chief thing intended, That <hi>Religious worship is due to Saints and Angels as well as to God himself,</hi> I shall direct my answer only against this mistake.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. First therefore I say, That that ground of allotting <hi>Religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> to Saints and Angels is very weak, namely, <hi>because they have a middle excellency betwixt God and man.</hi> For it is plain they have not in a due and strict sense; that being a Privilege belonging to Christ alone, who is the acknowledged <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>God-man,</hi> and therefore may justly be worshipped with <hi>Religious worship.</hi> Wherefore there being nothing that has truly a <hi>middle excellency</hi> betwixt God and Man, (as a <hi>Zoophyton</hi> may be rightly said to have a middle excellency betwixt an Animal and a Plant) saving the Man Christ <hi>Jesus;</hi> there is no Creature capable of <hi>Religious worship</hi> besides him: nor is he indeed capable thereof but in vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that Mysterious union with the true Godhead, and thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming as well God as Man.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. And then again, there is another fraud, and indeed the more princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal and original one, in the distribution of these <hi>Excellencies</hi> immediately into three, whenas it had been more faithfully and Logically done to have distributed <hi>Excellency,</hi> first into <hi>Created</hi> and <hi>Increated;</hi> and then <hi>Created</hi> Excellency into that of <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi> and that of <hi>Men.</hi> But hereby the boldness and grossness of their assigning <hi>Religious worship</hi> to that which is but a Creature would have appeared at first sight; the Creatour stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in contradiction to it, who is infinitely more Excellent then any glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified creature whatsoever; or rather, whose degree of Excellency above the most glorious Creature that is, is infinitely greater then the degree of Excellency of <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> above <hi>Men.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="28" facs="tcp:42932:21"/>
Whence appears what a rash and forced thing it is to hold together two Excellencies betwixt which there is that infinite distance, in one common capacity of receiving <hi>Religious worship;</hi> I mean the <hi>Divine</hi> Excellency, and that of <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Saints:</hi> whenas the <hi>Humane</hi> Excellency and that of <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> are infinitely nearer one another, and therefore infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more fit to receive worship of one common denomination to both. Which may very well be termed <hi>Civil,</hi> the glorified <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Good men</hi> being but <hi>fellow-servants</hi> and <hi>fellow-citizens</hi> of that new <hi>Jerusalem</hi> which reaches from Heaven to Earth; according as it is written, <hi>But you are come to the Mount Sion, and to the City of the</hi>

                           <hi>living God, the Heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of Angels, and the Spirits of just men made perfect.</hi> Which shews plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Good men upon Earth</hi> are all of one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munialty, Citizens of the same City, the new <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> and <hi>fellow-citizens</hi> you know do not give <hi>Religious worship</hi> one to another, but only <hi>Civil.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">5. Nor yet <hi>fellow-servants;</hi> as the Angel argues to <hi>John</hi> in the Apocalyps; <hi>And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Chap. 19.</note> 
                           <hi>See thou doe it not; I am thy fellow-servant, and of thy brethren that have the testimonie of Jesus: Worship God.</hi> Now if the Angel here refused <hi>Civil</hi> worship, how groundless a thing were it, nay how disallowable, to have offered him <hi>Religious</hi> worship? And if he refused <hi>Religious</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship though present, how unlawfull is this worship, suppose but <hi>Dulia,</hi> to a Saint or Angel being absent? And if that worship tendred was <hi>Latria,</hi> and not <hi>Dulia,</hi> why did not the Angel rather say, <hi>I am thy Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-creature,</hi> then thy <hi>Fellow-servant?</hi> And lastly, if <hi>Dulia</hi> be a warrantable worship, and rightly given to <hi>Angels,</hi> why was not that Angel so chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table as to interpret <hi>John</hi>'s worshipping him, to be that kind that was lawfull and warrantable? or why was he so uncharitable to the Church, or injurious to his fellow-<hi>Angels,</hi> as to vex the one with Scrupulosities about this duty of worshipping Angels and Saints, by his so nice declining the Homage, and to deprive the other of their due, by his so eminent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, that in all likelihood would be so prevalent with the Church, that it would hazard the belief of the whole duty of <hi>Angel-worship?</hi> But I believe the distinction of <hi>Dulia</hi> and <hi>Latria</hi> is so subtil, that the eye of an Angel could never spie out any such chink or least crack in Religious worship, whereby it might be broke asunder, or so divided that any the smallest part thereof may fall to the share of that which is not truely God; as Saints and Angels assuredly are not. So plainly doth it appear both from the sense of Scripture, and that infinite disproportion betwixt the distances that are found betwixt God and the Creature, and betwixt the Creatures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, that only <hi>Civil,</hi> not <hi>Religious</hi> worship is competible to them.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. But thirdly, There is not only this infinitely-vast distance betwixt God and a Creature, the best Saint or Angel that is; but there is (which I have already given an hint of) a very close cognation and near affinity of nature betwixt <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Good men.</hi> For as for the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Saints and Good men upon Earth, besides that they are of the same species in their natural respects, so their Graces are alike, though not

in the like measure; they both being Regenerate by one and the same Spirit, and therefore are both in a supernatural condition. How then can that Honour due to the one and the other <hi>toto genere differre,</hi> that one must be <hi>Religious</hi> worship, the other <hi>Civil?</hi>

                        <p>And there is so little difference betwixt a <hi>glorified Saint</hi> and an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel,</hi> that a Good man will be found to bear the same proportion of excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to both; and therefore it is plain that <hi>Religious worship</hi> is due to neither.</p>

                           </gap>, <hi>But neither are the good and blessed Genii</hi> or <hi>Angels, as we call them,</hi> saith he, <hi>above men once accomplished in Reason and Vertue.</hi> How could he then ever have dream'd of giving <hi>Religious worship</hi> to <hi>Saints,</hi> in whom there is something a nearer likeness or cognation with us?</p>
                        <p n="8">8. Fourthly, If there be any such <hi>Religious worship</hi> as <hi>Dulia,</hi> to the duties of which of the Two Tables does it belong? to the <hi>First</hi> or to the <hi>Second</hi> Table? The Second concerns our duty to our <hi>Neighbour.</hi> But if <hi>Saints</hi> or <hi>Angels</hi> be our <hi>Neighbours,</hi> how comes <hi>Religious worship</hi> due to them? If they be not, how come the Dues of the <hi>Second table</hi> to be challenged by them? If <hi>Dulia</hi> therefore have any place at all in the Tables, it must, according to our adversary's supposal, be referred to the <hi>First.</hi> But to which of the Commandments therein? Does God his forbidding to <hi>have any Gods besides himself</hi> infer Divine worship due to Angels or Saints? or his being a <hi>Jealous God,</hi> that his pleasure is to be worshipped in an <hi>Idol?</hi> For such is every thing that is not God, and yet is <hi>Religiously</hi> worshipped. Wherefore he that will assert that <hi>Dulia</hi> is a duty owing to Saints and Angels, must forge a <hi>Third</hi> Table for it, and have the impudence to adde it to the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> and blame <hi>Moses</hi> for a very great omission. For there were as worthy Angels, and as capable of Religious worship, in his time as ever there were since.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. Fifthly and lastly, Those two places which I produced to prove <hi>That God alone is to be worshipped,</hi> will also prove <hi>That Religious worship is but One:</hi> as that in S. <hi>Luke, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him alone shalt thou serve.</hi> The force of which Answer <note place="margin">Chap. 4.</note> made to the Devil by Christ, when he would have tempted him to fall down and worship him, surely consists in this, <hi>That no Religious worship is to be given to any but to God alone.</hi> For that the Devil did not require that which is called <hi>Latria,</hi> is evident in that he did discover him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self not to be the Highest <hi>Numen,</hi> in acknowledging that the disposing of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:42932:22"/>
the Kingdoms of the Earth and the glory of them was <hi>but committed to him</hi> from another, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, and therefore he had them not from himself, and consequently did not pretend to be the most High God from whom are all things. Wherefore the Devil could not be so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable as to expect, nor so foolish as to demand, that our Saviour should doe any Worship unto him as to the most High God, whenas he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready confessed himself not to be so: but that which he drove at was to get him to doe <hi>Religious worship</hi> to him, such as is done to the many Gods of the Nations on this side of the notion of the most High.</p>
                        <p>But the sense of our Saviour's answer is, That there is not any Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous worship at all belonging to any saving to God alone: and being out of patience (if I may so speak) at the motion to so impious an Act, he calls him <hi>Devil,</hi> for that so enormous a suggestion; none but <hi>Devils</hi> either requiring or admitting the doing of any <hi>Religious worship</hi> to them. He does not abstain from worshipping him because he was a <hi>Devil,</hi> but concludes him a <hi>Devil,</hi> because he not being the true God, would yet be Religiously worshipped. Nor did he answer, <hi>Thou shalt only worship God and the good Angels;</hi> but, <hi>Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him alone shalt thou serve.</hi> Wherefore there is <hi>but one only Religious worship,</hi> namely that which is due to God.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. The like also is manifestly inferred from that to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> where the Authour of that Epistle proving the Divinity of Christ, cites that of the Psalms, <hi>Let all the Angels of God worship him:</hi> which questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onless is understood of <hi>Religious worship,</hi> or else it would be nothing to the purpose; and yet if there be two kinds of <hi>Religious worship, Latria</hi> and <hi>Dulia,</hi> it will be still as little. So plain is it that there is <hi>but one kind of Religious worship,</hi> which is appropriate to God alone. Nor could the <hi>Arrians</hi> by the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> be justly deemed <hi>Idolaters,</hi> nor <hi>Nestorius</hi> an <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, if there be more kinds of Religious worship then one. For neither <hi>Nestorius</hi> nor the <hi>Arrians</hi> could mean by that worship they gave Christ, the worship of <hi>Latria;</hi> for that had been expresly to acknowledge him to be what they so obstinately denied him to be, namely, the true God.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore the Synod and S. <hi>Cyril,</hi> and as many else as judged the <hi>Arrians Idolaters</hi> and <hi>Nestorius</hi> an <hi>Anthropolatra,</hi> do plainly give wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness <hi>that Religious worship is but One.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="11">11. Nor can that affectionate respect we shew either to the Bible when we kiss it, upon the taking of an Oath, or that which we doe to the holy Prophets of God, or his Priests and faithfull Ministers, when we reverence them as such, disturb our account, or pretend to an example of another kind of <hi>Religious</hi> worship. For I absolutely deny that it is any <hi>Religious</hi> either respect or affection at all to the Bible, or to a man of God; but that out of that <hi>Religious</hi> respect and affection we bear to God himself, another emerges toward those things that relate to him, but quite of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other kind; to persons, <hi>Civil;</hi> but to inanimate things, if they be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with persons that are holy, it were scarce any boldness to adventure to say it is a species of respect <hi>less then civil:</hi> But differences are where we have no names to call them by.</p>

                           <pb n="31" facs="tcp:42932:22"/>
And it seems to me as absurd to infer, Because I have a respect for the Bible or any holy man of God, from a <hi>Religious</hi> regard I bear to God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, that this to the Bible or the holy man is also a <hi>Religious</hi> reverence or respect; as to infer, because a woman out of that conjugal affection and respect she bears to her husband, has also from thence (which otherwise she would not have) a respect and affection for his spaniel, that that affection or respect she bore to the spaniel, should either be, or be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, a conjugal affection: which is harsh and ridiculous at first sight.</p>

                           </p>
                        </argument>
                        <p n="1">1. WHerefore we being so well satisfied concerning the <hi>Oneness of Religious worship,</hi> we shall be able to make a more true and logical distribution of <hi>Honour</hi> or <hi>Worship</hi> then what was above produced; dividing it immediately, first into <hi>Religious</hi> and <hi>Civil;</hi> and then <hi>Civil</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Political, Oeconomical,</hi> and <hi>Moral;</hi> and <hi>Political</hi> again into <hi>Secular</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> or else into <hi>Temporal</hi> and <hi>Spiritual,</hi> either terms being well enough known. By <hi>Moral worship</hi> I understand such honour or respect as passes from private men one to another, or at least as to private, upon account of <hi>Moral worth;</hi> such as <hi>Liberality, Wisdom, Fidelity,</hi> and the like: the rest the very words will interpret. Nor is it pertinent to my scope to meddle with any but the first, namely, <hi>Religious worship;</hi> for the understanding the nature whereof I have taken all these pains hitherto.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Which I conceive is rightly defined thus: <hi>A Devotional acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of the incommunicable Name or Excellency of God, by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of some outward Rite or Ceremonie appropriated to that end or purpose, namely, of externally signifying our inward acknowledgement of the Divine Name or Excellency.</hi> This is a true and the most general
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:42932:23"/>
definition that can be made of <hi>Religious worship.</hi> For that Religion that is placed in worshipping Saints, Angels, Daemons, Images, and the like, is truly Irreligion, Idolatry, or Superstition: but is no more to be called <hi>Religious worship,</hi> then Vice Vertue, Injustice Justice, or Cowardise Fortitude, whatever abuses of the word may have crept in by the unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and inconsiderate.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Now since the giving of <hi>Religious worship</hi> to that which is not God, is Idolatry, and that <hi>Religious worship</hi> in this true and proper sense is nothing else but <hi>a Devotional acknowledgement of the Divine Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, by certain appropriate signes significative of</hi> this <hi>our agnition;</hi> it is demonstratively evident, that where there is such <hi>a devotional acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement</hi> by these signes made to that which is not God, it is <hi>ipso facto</hi> Idolatry.</p>
                        <p>Nay though these <hi>appropriate signes</hi> were used without Devotion by the party toward the supposed Object, (which is worthy our observation, and true; because a plenary pravity or defect is not requisite for a vicious action) and were intended only by other men to be directed thither, or only were interpretable by custom to be so directed, it were <hi>Idolatry</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding: Or else the sin of <hi>Idolatry</hi> could not be forced upon any man, nor needed any either Jew or Christian to have scrupled the flin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging incense on the Altar to any Pagan-Deity, no not to have sacrificed whole Hecatombs to them, if their purses would have born it: And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever died martyrs upon this account, it were to be imputed rather to their madness or folly then to any true and solid piety.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore as it would be <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> though it were extorted by fear, and that a mans heart gave not assent thereto, to say, <hi>That Jesus Christ was not the Son of God, but an Impostour:</hi> so the using of the <hi>Appropriate signes</hi> of the acknowledgement of the Divine Excellency to that which is not God, though the assent goe not along, is notwithstanding the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging of that to be God which is not, (as that <hi>Blasphemy</hi> was the denying of him to be that was) and therefore cannot chuse but be flat Idolatry.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. And if Idolatry be committed without the parties devotion toward the undue Object, then let a man phansy this external <hi>Religious worship</hi> accompanied with as small degrees of Devotion or inward intention as he pleases, it will not fail to be <hi>Idolatry</hi> still. Which Consectary is of singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar use for the convincing men of the folly of such subterfuges as are sought in these new-coyned terms, of <hi>Dulia</hi> and <hi>Hyperdulia</hi> and <hi>Latria,</hi> whereby they would signifie certain <hi>differences</hi> or <hi>degrees</hi> of Religious worship, indeed distinct <hi>kinds</hi> thereof; whenas it can be but <hi>One,</hi> according to that true Definition we have given of it. For every act or effect of our Religious affection to God, expressed toward things or persons, is not straitway <hi>Religious worship,</hi> as may plainly appear from the definition thereof, and from what we have already intimated in the foregoing Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But to return to the matter in hand.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. By this general notion therefore of <hi>Religious worship,</hi> we have got now a considerable step nearer the discovery <hi>when Idolatry is committed;</hi> namely, <hi>when we perform some Rite or Ceremonie,</hi> that is to say, <hi>some</hi>
                           <pb n="33" facs="tcp:42932:23"/>
                           <hi>external Religious action, appropriate to the signifying our acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Divine Eminency, before, or rather unto, that which is not truly God.</hi> Where by <hi>before,</hi> or <hi>unto,</hi> I understand an intended direction (by our selves, or by others, or at least by interpretation of custom) of this Religious action, as to an <hi>Object</hi> we would honour thereby. For that is the only thing whereby the action becomes <hi>Idolatry.</hi> For there will be always a necessity of performing our Religious Rites <hi>before</hi> or <hi>towards</hi> something or other by way of <hi>circumstance of Place,</hi> which yet may be without the least guilt or suspicion of that crime. Wherefore it is <hi>the intended and accustomary application of the appropriate signes of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of the Divine Excellencies unto an Object where the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Excellencies are not,</hi> that is to say, <hi>to any thing that is not truly God,</hi> which is this hainous sin of <hi>Idolatry.</hi> Thus much, I say, must be; and thus much alone, without the superaddition of any thing else, does fully complete the nature of that sin.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. For those that phansy themselves so marvellously slie and subtil in foisting in this requisite more, viz. <q>That the application of these signes appropriated to the signifying of that honour we owe to God must, in Idolatry, be made to the Creature, as to God himself, that is to say, with an intent of conciliating to the adored Creature the esteem of being very God; do assuredly commit a gross piece of folly in da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to make such an assertion.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>For as a woman that renders or gives up to one that is not her husband what is appropriate to her husband, to wit the use of her body, let her phansy what mental restrictions or directions of her intention she will in the act, is questionless a downright Adulteress: So whosoever applies the Appropriate acknowledgements of the Divine Excellency, which is Religious worship, to that which is not God, let him mince it as well as he can with mental limitations and restrictions, if he once pass this Religious worship upon this undue Object, he is thereby without all controversy a gross <hi>Idolater.</hi> And as her saying she did not doe it as to her husband, will not excuse her from <hi>Adultery;</hi> so the other's saying he did not doe it as to God, will not excuse him from <hi>Idolatry,</hi> which is <hi>Spiritual Fornication.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="7">7. Besides, if <hi>Idolatry</hi> be not committed but when the Creature is religiously worshipped for the most high God, or as if it were the most high God, intending the worship as to such; it will be hard to find an example of <hi>Idolatry</hi> in all Heathenism. For amongst the many Gods they worshipped, there was but One worshipped <hi>as the most High,</hi> whom the Latines styled <hi>Jupiter,</hi> the Greeks <gap reason="foreign">

                           <hi>all respects or duties are not to be paid to the Father, as all Sacrifices are not made to Jupiter.</hi> But those that were not made to him (which surely were the most) were no Idolatrous worship according to this Hypothesis, nor those that were made to his Statue by them that took it not for <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> nor those that were sacrificed to <hi>Jupiter</hi> himself as to the Father and

                        <p n="8">8. To this you may adde, That, in that we have already proved <hi>That Religious worship is but One,</hi> the application of it to any Object upon any terms, saving to the only true God, is <hi>ipso facto</hi> Idolatry.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. And lastly, if the appropriate signes of Religious worship might be used in the veneration of a creature, to what end is the <hi>Divinity</hi> of Christ so expresly set down in the Holy Writ, and so zealously contended for in all ages of the Church? For the Divine worship we give him, according to the fond assertion above mentioned, might be done unto him though he were a mere man.

                        <p n="1">1. WHerefore we want nothing now for the clear discovering when Idolatry is committed, but a distinct and determinate know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the <hi>appropriate Signes of Divine worship.</hi> Which truly I think are not hard to be known. <hi>Grotius,</hi> a person not over-forward to phansy that Idolatry which is not, has expresly named three, <hi>Sacrificium, Liba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Suffitus,</hi> which he calls <hi>Venerationis Signa, quae consensus Gentium Divini cultûs esse propria voluit,</hi> and so has not only afforded us Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, but a Rule how to find out proper Signes of Divine worship; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that at least those are such that consent of Nations has made so.</p>
                        <p>And I think it seasonable here (because some do so rashly appropriate
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:42932:24"/>
                           <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to that which they call <hi>Latria,</hi> as if this signe of Religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship were adequately proper to God, others communicable to other Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects) to take notice, that if they mean by <hi>Sacrifice</hi> the Mactation of living Creatures, that manner of worship not being in use amongst Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, it must needs enhance the nature of other Signes of Religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and make them the more apparently incommunicable to any created Object, which yet were really so, though this case were not.

Nay I adde further, That the asking of such things as are in the power of a creature to give, as suppose a fit medicine for such or such a malady, or assistance in danger upon the way in a journey; if the one be asked, suppose, of <hi>Aesculapius</hi> in a Temple and at an Altar consecrated to his Ghost, and the other of <hi>Hercules</hi> at one dedicated to his; these petitions of such feasible good offices, yea and, if you will, begged of these Ghosts or Daemons present there and visible, (and there is the same reason in Saints and Angels) would not fail notwithstanding to be <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry;</hi> the <hi>Consent of Nations having made the erecting and dedicating Temples and Altars for Prayers, Vows and Sacrifices</hi> a Sign of <hi>Divine worship,</hi> and it was, you know, the formal worship of the most High God, the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> while the Temple stood, whose residence was conceived more peculiarly upon the <hi>Cherubims,</hi> which were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from the eye of the People, that they might not commit Idolatry with them.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. But the Gentiles very depravedly used this circumstance of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious worship, and made their addresses towards the open Images, or Statues of Divine residence, consecrated to that purpose, where the God was to receive their Offerings and Prayers. So that though all Nations at all times did not use this representation of the Divine residence by <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages,</hi> yet where it was in use (which was exceeding general) it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest that it was part of the Divinest worship, and such as they used towards the Highest <hi>Numen.</hi> And seeing that this manner of Divine presence or visible Residence by <hi>Images</hi> was not only used in the worship of the <hi>inferiour Daemons,</hi> but of such as were styled <hi>Dii coelestes,</hi> (whom assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they could not think exiled from Heaven to assist at these earthly Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues) it is a sign that the <hi>Image</hi> it self was reckoned for the visible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Deity they did adore, and consequently that this representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the presence of the Deity, whether the Deity be personally there
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:42932:25"/>
present or no, is that which by <hi>Consent of Nations</hi> has passed into an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary mode of Divine worship.</p>
                        <p>Nor can the erection of <hi>Temples, Altars,</hi> or other Symbols of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous worship, to them that are not Gods, make these cease to be such Signes or Symbols. For then, since they all have been after that manner abused, there would be no signes of Divine worship left at all. But rather on the contrary we are to conclude, that whatever things were consecrated to the worship or honour of the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> that to consecrate the like to that which is not God is an invading his right, and a manifest act of Idolatry.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. <hi>Hymns</hi> also, and <hi>Incurvations,</hi> as they may be framed, will be unavoidably <hi>Signes of Divine worship:</hi> as namely, if this <hi>Incurvation</hi> be made to any particular invisible power, while he is invisible; for it is an acknowledgement of one of the incommunicable Excellencies of God, viz. his <hi>Ubiquity.</hi> For we may bow any where to the invisible God, because he is every where: but to bow to any particular Angel or Spirit, while he is invisible, is incongruous, because he is not every where. Therefore he that does this worship to him as congruous, does therewith, <hi>interpretative,</hi> acknowledge by that act an <hi>Ubiquity</hi> in him; and thereby becomes an <hi>Idolater.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Incurvation</hi> also towards an <hi>Image</hi> erected to any Creature (especially in a <hi>Temple,</hi> or on an <hi>Altar,</hi> yea though removed from both) were a sign of Religious worship or service by infallible definition, <hi>Thou shalt not bow down to them, nor serve them:</hi> that is to say, Thou shalt not doe the service of <hi>Incurvation,</hi> nor any other Religious service to them. For <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                           <hi>Service</hi> is <hi>Cultus religiosus,</hi> of which <hi>Incurvation</hi> in such circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances is assuredly one kind; I mean, exhibited either to an invisible power, or to its visible representation in an Image. Concerning the latter whereof, <hi>Consent of Nations</hi> has also made it an appropriate Sign of Religious worship, especially in a <hi>Temple,</hi> as I noted before.</p>
                        <p>And now for <hi>Hymns,</hi> I say, the framing of a <hi>Song</hi> to the praise of any created Being, suppose <hi>Sun, Moon,</hi> or <hi>Daemon,</hi> if there be such Epithets therein as signifie the incommunicable Excellencies of God; as if one should begin, <hi>O Sol Omnipotens,</hi> or, <hi>O Luna Omniscia;</hi> this would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly not fail to be the giving of <hi>Divine worship</hi> to the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> upon which account <hi>Martial</hi> seems to me not <hi>a flatterer</hi> only of <hi>Domitian,</hi> but an <hi>Idolater,</hi> in that <hi>Hendecasyllabon,</hi>

Wherein he writes after <hi>Domitian</hi>'s own copy, who taught his Ministers of State this Epistolar form, <hi>Deus &amp; Dominus noster sic fieri jubet.</hi> Which if it might be more tolerable in Pagan Kingdoms, where <hi>Dii</hi> usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly amounted to no more then <hi>Angeli</hi> amongst us; yet in Christian Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, where <hi>God</hi> is an <hi>incommunicable name,</hi> as the Author of the <hi>Book of Wisdom</hi> intimates, the calling of any man <hi>God</hi> cannot but be <hi>Idolatry,</hi> or <hi>Blasphemy.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">6. But not the less <hi>Idolatry</hi> for being <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> sith every <hi>Idolatry</hi> is so. For <hi>Idolatry,</hi> by giving the appropriate Signes of the acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Divine Excellency to a vile Creature, (and every Creature is so in respect of God) does equalize that Creature unto God, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:42932:25"/>
makes God as vile as that Creature. Which is a manifest revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and <hi>Blaspheming</hi> of him, worse then the calling of a Prince by the name of the basest vermin. I say therefore, in such Countries as the name of <hi>God</hi> usually signifies the <hi>true God,</hi> and not Angels, to apply that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation to any man, is both <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Blasphemy:</hi> as it would be to use any Gesture to him that were appropriate to Divine adoration; which made the Greeks that they would not doe reverence to the King of <hi>Persia</hi> in the <hi>Persian</hi> mode, because that was the very posture which in <hi>Greece</hi> they used in worshipping their Gods.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. These are the chief, if not all, the <hi>Signes of Divine worship</hi> that easily occur to my mind. And if I have let any escape my recital in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, they will easily be recalled, if not kept safe in the general Notion I have given of the <hi>Appropriate Signes of Religious worship,</hi> namely, That <hi>all they are such that either Consent of Nations, or the Use of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Countries, or the natural Signification of the thing it self, or else Divine definition has made so.</hi> Of the first sort of which are <hi>Meat-offerings, Drink-offerings, Burning of Incense, Erecting Altars, Dedicating Images,</hi> and the like. Of the second sort is <hi>such or such a posture of Religious veneration proper to such a Country,</hi> as in that example of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> which was obligatory to them of that Country. And of the third, <hi>The praying for the Holy Spirit, for Remission of Sins, Eternal life, or for what else is out of the power of the Creature to give;</hi> also <hi>The making of Vows and Oaths,</hi> they implying an absolute <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> in them in whose name they are made, and not only a knowledge of the fact, but a power of punishing out of the road of Humane laws; of which power and knowledge we have no assurance in any particular Spirit, but in God only. To which you may adde <hi>The invoking of any particular invisible powers, while they are invisible,</hi> though in such things as they are naturally able to help us in. <hi>Hymns</hi> also, or any <hi>Compellations</hi> whatsoever made to a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>if the words signifie the incommunicable Excellencies of God.</hi> All these of their own nature, and whatsoever are like these, are the <hi>Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate Signes of Religious worship,</hi> though the <hi>Consent of Nations</hi> did not give their suffrage; and are not due to any thing, nor lawfull to be given to any thing, but to the true God. Whence the misapplication of them to any other Object will certainly be the sin of <hi>Idolatry.</hi> Lastly, an example of the last sort is <hi>Bowing to Images,</hi> it being declared in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue a kind of service of them, according as I noted before.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. And now, that no man may phansy to have found any creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hole to evade the power and plainness of our Reason, by pretending that <hi>Religious worship</hi> is of a larger extent then what I have defined, I shall here timely advertise him, not only that I matter not what careless abuses there may be put upon a word, or what forced pullings and drawings to make proper terms to stretch for the covering and palliating unproper actions or unsound opinions; but also (and of which I would have him take special notice) that the strength of our Demonstrations will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the singleness of the signification of <hi>Religious worship,</hi> (which yet I have sufficiently proved to be but <hi>One)</hi> but upon the truth of that Definition we have given thereof, in that sense that is there professedly

intended. For no man can deny but the <hi>Religious worship</hi> due to God alone (though he were so extravagant as to conceit some kind of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious worship</hi> due to some Creatures) is truly and exactly defined in the above-said Definition. And I promise here aforehand, that my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions of Idolatry shall be fetched, not from the supposition that <hi>Religious worship</hi> may have no other sense then according to which I have defined it in this Definition, but only from the truth of the Definition of that <hi>Religious worship</hi> which is due to God alone; to the end that there may not be the least room left for any imaginable cavil or evasion, or for any shadow or dream thereof.</p>

                           <p>1. A brief enumeration of the parts of that full instruction we have to discern what is <hi>Idolatry.</hi> 2. That the Adoration of the Cross is Idolatry. 3. As also the Worshipping any Person of the holy Trinity by an Image or Picture. 4. That Religious worship given to Saints or Angels, though without the use of any <hi>Image</hi> or <hi>Picture,</hi> is Idolatry. 5. That the mere Invocation of any particular invisible power is also Idolatrous. 6. Certain Evasions touching the <hi>praying to Saints</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered. 7. Another subterfuge answered. 8. Worshipping Saints by Images a double Idolatry. 9. That it is Idolatry to worship an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, taking it for the Saint himself. 10. As also the Adoration of any man alive upon Earth. 11. That the worshipping of the <hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristick Bread,</hi> taken for the real Body of Christ, is Idolatry. 12. That all the above said acts are Idolatrous, let men pretend what they will to cover the guilt. 13. And that <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap> in S. <hi>Peter</hi> does not imply a lawfulness in any kind of Idolatry.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p n="1">1. WE are now I think sufficiently instructed, partly by the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged examples of Idolatry committed by Heathens or Jews, and partly by the knowledge of the adequate Object of Idolatry, as also of the right Definition of <hi>Religious worship</hi> and of the <hi>appropriate Signes</hi> thereof, and of the formal or essential application of those Signes, to discern and define infallibly what would be <hi>Idolatry,</hi> where-ever it was practised amongst Christians themselves, and what not.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. As for example, <hi>To adore the Cross,</hi> or <hi>to give any Religious worship thereto, though there were no Image upon it, would be Idolatry,</hi> according to the First Instance thereof, and of such as are referrable thereto, which shew that <hi>Idolatry</hi> may be committed without an <hi>Image.</hi> And that it is here committed, is plain, in that we suppose the <hi>appropriate Signes of Divine worship</hi> used in the adoration thereof. Which done to any creature, is <hi>ipso facto</hi> Idolatry.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Secondly, <hi>To doe Religious worship to the Picture or Image of any Person of the holy Trinity, or of all three, or particularly to the Image of Christ,</hi> though this Religious worship is intended to pass through the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:42932:26"/>
representation to God himself, Father, Son, or Holy Ghost, is notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing <hi>Idolatry</hi> according to the second Instance, where worshipping the true God by an Image is proved to be such.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Thirdly, <hi>The worshipping Angels, or Saints, yea the blessed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin herself, with Religious worship, though without an Image, is Idolatry:</hi> And such may be a Religious Invocation of them, the asking of them such things as are proper only for God to give, as <hi>Remission of sins, Assistance of grace,</hi> and <hi>Eternal life;</hi> or using any <hi>Epithets</hi> in <hi>Hymns</hi> or <hi>Songs to them,</hi> that signifie the <hi>incommunicable</hi> Excellencies of God; or lastly, <hi>making Vows, and Swearing in their names.</hi> This plainly appears from the first Instance of Idolatry, and from those kinds of appropriate signes of Divine worship that of their own nature are discoverable to be such.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. And truly such is the <hi>Invocation of the help of this or that Saint,</hi> though it were not in those more conspicuous circumstances of putting up our Petitions in a Temple, or before the Image of the Saint we pray to. For the <hi>simple Invocation of a particular invisible power</hi> is of it self <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,</hi> without those other circumstances; because it consequentially attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes that to that power which is only proper to the true God, I mean <hi>Omnipresence</hi> or <hi>Ubiquity.</hi> For no man can be assured that an invisible power is in such a particular place, but by Supposition that he is in all places at once; which is the proper Prerogative of God.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore <hi>simple Invocation of any particular invisible power</hi> is no such slight business as some make it, but <hi>absolute Idolatry,</hi> nay I think the most <hi>fundamental part</hi> of all the <hi>Idolatry</hi> committed by the Heathen, (if rationally and philosophically examined) and the mother of the rest. Or at least whatever great exception there is, or convincingly rational, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst those usual Signes of Religious worship being given to these par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular invisible powers, it is found here, and is allegeable against <hi>Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> For the main is, That it implies an <hi>Omnipresence</hi> of that invisible power they worship.</p>
                        <p>And therefore the Consecrating of a Temple and Altar and a Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical residence or visible representation, and Offering of Sacrifices, and the like, cannot be competible to any but the <hi>All-present</hi> God, whom they are always sure to find at home, if I may so speak, when they make their approaches to his House. But for other particular invisible powers, who knows whether they be at home or no; or whether pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing, or in a journey, or asleep somewhere, as <hi>Elias</hi> sarcastically argues concerning <hi>Baal;</hi> nay I will adde, whether they be not carried away cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and confined to some other place? None can have any certainty of them where they are, or whether ever there where their visible and sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical residence is erected, unless they be <hi>Omnipresent,</hi> and of necessity are there, because every-where: If not, we have no faith nor assurance of their Presence or Audience. But <hi>Prayer and Invocation</hi> supposes faith and assurance of being heard, at least in that ordinary sense; of which there being no assurance without the invisible Power invoked be <hi>Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present,</hi> it is plain that he that <hi>invokes</hi> an invisible Power interpretatively implies its <hi>Omnipresence,</hi> and consequently, if it be a particular Power and finite, commits <hi>Idolatry</hi> thereby.</p>
                        <p n="6">
                           <pb n="40" facs="tcp:42932:27"/>
6. Nor can the demonstrativeness of this Reason be eluded or evaded by those usuall subterfuges of <hi>the Saints seeing and knowing all things by particular revelation from God,</hi> or by <hi>the exalted peculiarity of their condition in that separate glorified state they are in.</hi> For those that talk at this rate rant it, and speak unintelligible riddles, without all ground or probability of Reason or warrant of Scripture; they being mere after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figments and precarious suppositions to excuse the madness and extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy of their Idolatrous actions.</p>
                        <p>For as for the latter surmise, it is plainly a dream, to think the blessed Virgin, suppose, merely by virtue of her glorified and separate condition from this terrestrial body, can hear from Heaven at such a vast distance the devout whispers or suspirations of her affectionate Supplicants, or see through the earth their humble prostrations. For she is called upon by the inhabitants of this Globe in all postures or distances of Habitation, even by those that are <hi>Antipodes</hi> one to another: where if she assist the one, she must be at least the Earth's Diameter distant from the other, through which distance neither her sight nor hearing can ever penetrate.</p>
                        <p>And for the former Hypothesis, how childish and ridiculous is it! they pretending that they supplicate the Saints to speak to God in their behalf, whenas the Saints cannot speak to God till he tell them their errand first, who has received the message from the Supplicant already, but must impart it to the Saints to say it over to him again; which shews the incongruity of making any addresses to them, and (considering how perfectly appeasable and propitious, and how freely accessible God is through the only name and mediation of <hi>Jesus</hi> Christ) is such an useless patch and bungle in Divinity, that it cannot seem credible to any man of common sense: and therefore there is no such special revelation to the Saints of our compellation of them in our Prayers, and consequently the <hi>Invocation</hi> of them (which is proper to God, by reason of his <hi>Omniscious Ubiquity)</hi> being thus misplaced upon these particular invisible powers, must be interpretatively an act of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> there being done such an act of worship to them as implies in the Object such an Excellency as is found only in God.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Nor will their profession of those diminishing apprehensions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Saints in other respects (as, That they are not the true God, but only glorified Creatures, and That they are Intercessours in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to Christ, and the like) excuse them from <hi>Idolatry:</hi> For the acknowledgement of any one Divine Excellency and Peculiarity of the Godhead in that which is a mere Creature, is undoubtedly <hi>Idolatry;</hi> as the betraying any one Castle to the enemy is Treason against a Prince. And the Pagans were esteemed as Idolaters in worshipping <hi>Mercury</hi> and the whole order of the <hi>Medioxumous</hi> or <hi>internuntial Deities</hi> or <hi>Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> for all their acknowledging them inferiour to the Supreme God. So that I cannot see but that <hi>the mere Invocation of Saints or Angels is a palpable, nay a fundamental, piece of Idolatry,</hi> and in reference to which all the pomp and furniture of Idolatry was superstructed; I mean the building of their Temples, erecting Altars and Images, Incensing, and Sacrificing, and the rest. For all end in, or are circumstances of <hi>Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi>
                           <pb n="41" facs="tcp:42932:27"/>
upon faith and assurance to be heard, which cannot be rationally placed in any invisible power, unless it be <hi>Omnipresent;</hi> which this <hi>Invocation</hi> does naturally and necessarily implie, else there will be no sense of the action, but it will be very incongruous and ridiculous. For other suppositions are arbitrarious, uncertain, nay incredible surmises touching an invisible power, and upon which there can be no faith not assurance of being heard.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. Fourthly, And as this worship of <hi>Invocation</hi> to either Saint or Angel, <hi>without the use of an Image,</hi> is thus plainly <hi>Idolatry;</hi> so the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking</hi> them, or any other way of worshipping them <hi>with an Image;</hi> must be a double piece of Idolatry, and is referrable to the <hi>third</hi> Mode thereof.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. Fifthly, The worshipping of the Image, suppose of the blessed Virgin or of any other Saint, upon a mistake that it is the very Virgin herself or this or that Saint, is also <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and to be referred to the <hi>fourth</hi> Instance thereof.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. Sixthly, To worship any man yet living with Religious worship, whether in gesture, compellation, appellation, or any thing else that is an appropriate Sign of the incommunicable Excellencies of God, is also Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, and is to be referred to the <hi>first</hi> Instance.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. Seventhly and lastly, To worship the <hi>Consecrated Bread in the Eucharist,</hi> though upon full persuasion that it is <hi>transsubstantiated</hi> into the Body of Christ, and so Hypostatically united with the Divinity, is, notwithstanding this opinion conceited of it, a real act of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and is evidently referrable to the last Instance.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. All these acts or what other soever of the same nature that can be found, though amongst Christians, and upon the pretence of worshipping God and Christ, are assuredly acts of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> according to the undeniable Notion and Definition thereof, which is, <hi>The worshipping that which is not God by the appropriate Signes of Religious worship, such as either use or the nature of the thing it self has made the proper Modes of our acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of the Divine Excellencies.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="13">13. And now that I have proved such acts as these <hi>Idolatrous,</hi> I need not bestow any new pains to prove them <hi>unlawfull;</hi> because all Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry is so, according to the vote and sense of Scripture and of all men. For to goe about to infer that some kind of Idolatry is lawfull, because <note n="*" place="margin">1 Ep. 4. 3.</note>

                        <argument>
                           <p>1. That the professing one only true God does not necessarily quit a People from the guilt or capacity of being Idolaters. 2. That to exhibit such Modes of worship as are proper to the true God to a Creature, though we take it for a Creature, is Idolatry. 3. That the Jews were Idolaters, though they professed the only true God. 4. That the belief of the <hi>Eucharistick Bread</hi> being the real Body of Christ does not excuse the adorer thereof from Idolatry. 5. The case of the Heathen that worshipped the <hi>Sun,</hi> and this of the <hi>Bread-worshippers,</hi> compared. 6. A solution of a Sophism the Authour once put upon himself in excuse of this <hi>Bread-worship.</hi> 7. That their not thinking the <hi>Bread</hi> to be in the Eucharist does not excuse the worshippers of the Host from I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p n="1">1. HAving thus evidenced the <hi>Falseness</hi> of the <hi>Mystery of Iniquity</hi> in this first point; according to my professed method, I shall proceed to the <hi>Fraud,</hi> which (as I have already intimated) includes the fallacious <hi>pretences</hi> and <hi>excuses,</hi> together with the <hi>Self-endedness</hi> of the drivers on of this impious Mystery.</p>
                        <p>And truly the <hi>pretences</hi> and <hi>shelters</hi> under which they would shroud themselves are very slender and scant, but their <hi>Self-ends</hi> may be gross and palpable. As methinks that would be a very poor plea for the Christians, namely, that they, forsooth, cannot possibly be Idolaters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they apertly and declaredly profess that there is only one true God, of a nature infinitely excellent above any Creature, and that therefore if they were Idolaters they should contradict themselves: Wherefore no professours of Christianity, though they did Religious worship to <hi>Saints,</hi> to <hi>Angels,</hi> to <hi>Images,</hi> to <hi>Crosses,</hi> to a piece of <hi>consecrated Bread,</hi> could be Idolaters, especially if they shamelesly stand out with it, and out-face the world they are not so.</p>
                        <p>But the insufficiency of this excuse is too-too apparent, if we consider how easy and ordinary a thing it is for men to contradict the profession of their own faith. For how many are there, even of those that do truly believe <hi>there is a life to come,</hi> that do not live as if there were any such thing, and so contradict their belief by their actions? How many are there that professing <hi>a particular Providence of God and faith therein,</hi> yet in time of streights do not depend thereon, but divert to some unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full practice, or doe some wicked action to relieve themselves in distress, or secure themselves from danger? How many that will zealously de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim against Cruelty and Injustice, as things abhorted of God and man, and yet are themselves notoriously Unjust and Cruel in the judgement of all the disinteressed, though they themselves will make a more favourable construction of their own actions, and will stand it out as stoutly for their justification, as these professors of Christianity that they are no Idolaters?</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="43" facs="tcp:42932:29"/>
It may so fare therefore, that, as the Apostle speaks to <hi>Titus,</hi> men <note place="margin">Tit. 1. 16.</note> may profess to know God, but in their works deny him. They may say there is one only true God, yet doe that Homage which is due to him alone unto this or that Creature, without saying or intending that this Creature should be taken for the true God, or that they doe that Religious worship to it as to the true God. Which is such a piece of Idolatry as never was amongst the Heathens themselves, nor can explicitely fall into the mind of a man, no more then to believe contradictions while he thinks them so, or conscienciously to goe against the dictates of his own conscience while he thinks those dictates to be true. So plain is it, that no people can consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enciously and devotionally give that worship which they think due to God alone, unto that which they think is not the true God.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. But out of inadvertency, ill education, or accustomary Superstition, it is not impossible but that, not knowing or not taking notice that such or such Ceremonies or Modes of worship are properly due to the only true God, they may use them in honour to that which is but a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or the Image of a Creature, be it Saint or Angel; nor can the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring they are God's Creatures in this case secure a man from <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</hi> For the mistake in the nature of the worship they perform to them does lapse them into <hi>Idolatry,</hi> notwithstanding they conceive of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject as of a Creature. And Ignorance can be no excuse, where there is opportunity of being better informed. Nay <hi>Incest</hi> and <hi>Adultery</hi> must be accounted and called by us <hi>Adultery</hi> and <hi>Incest,</hi> though practised in such countries as allow thereof, and we must say they are a more unclean people then our selves.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. To which you may adde, That the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Idolaters,</hi> and so declared by the Prophets of God, though they had not cast away the knowledge nor acknowledgment of their <hi>Jehovah,</hi> the only true God. Why may not therefore <hi>Christians</hi> be <hi>Idolaters,</hi> though they still profess they worship the only true God, and <hi>Jesus</hi> Christ whom he hath sent, the very same God once incarnate of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and so living amongst men upon Earth?</p>
                        <p n="4">4. And particularly concerning the <hi>Adoring of the Bread in the Eucharist</hi> upon a belief that it is the very Body of Christ, a Christian could not defend himself from the imputation of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> neither by the general plea before, nor by the proper plea to this case, namely, That he that thus adores it, does verily believe it to be the Body of Christ or his corporeal presence; I say, he cannot clear himself from being guilty of real Idolatry. For his Ignorance is not his excuse, no more then before.</p>
                        <p>For the sense of his Excuse is only this; That he gives this Divine worship to the seeming Bread, because he verily believes it to be God, and therefore a due Object of this worship; and that he gives no more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship then he thinks is due to the Object. If there be any sense in the Reason and Faculties of a man, this is the sense of their Plea: which if it be sound and just, we doe very unjustly to accuse any Nations or persons in the world of committing Idolatry, that were serious in the action. For can they devoutly or seriously doing it, conceive at the same time they doe their divine worship to an undue Object, and that that Object is
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:42932:30"/>
not capable of as much Religious worship as they doe to it?</p>
                        <p n="5">5. There was infinitely more reason that the Pagans should take the <hi>Sun</hi> to be that true and Eternal God that made and governs all things, as he is professed to be in the fragments of their Liturgies, then that any Christian should imagine a piece of <hi>consecrated Bread</hi> to be so. And I question not but that the ancient Heathen did as firmly believe the <hi>Sun</hi> to be God, as any Christian can believe the <hi>Eucharistick Bread</hi> to be the Body of Christ: But yet notwithstanding I think it never came into any Christian mans mind to doubt but that the worshippers of the <hi>Sun</hi> were Idolaters. How then is it possible but that a <hi>Bread-worshipping</hi> Christian upon the same terms must be an Idolater too, there being nothing intrinsecal that can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse the one but it will excuse the other also?</p>
                        <p>And as for the mitigation of the fault of either side from any exteriour circumstances, I briefly adde, That the glorious lustre of the <hi>Sun,</hi> his comfortable warmth, his notable effects, and vast influence upon the world, was a far stronger inducement and more unavoidable to make the Pagans think him to be God, then <hi>Hoc est corpus meum,</hi> or any gloss there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the Fathers of the Church, could justly be, to make any Christian be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the <hi>Eucharistick Bread</hi> is the real Body of <hi>Jesus</hi> Christ. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that as <hi>Murther</hi> and <hi>Adultery</hi> may have several degrees of aggravation, the fact being still the same; so let the Circumstances be more or less ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravable, as much as men may imagine them, yet the act we speak of is certainly <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">6. I must confess time was when I marvellously pleased my self in phansying I had found out so clear an evidence, as I then thought, to prove that the adoring of the Host, as it is called, was not Idolatry in them that believed that it was the very Body of Christ. For I thought it as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable a mistake as I my self once committed, when I was a boy, in asking a waggish cosin of mine blessing. For in the dusk of the eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, he having by chance placed himself in the Chair where my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther used ordinarily to sit, I passing by to goe up to bed, out of mistake begged, according to the custome of children, his benediction, thinking it was my Father; but he rewarding my blind devotion with a ludicrous blessing and loud laughter, I presently found my errour. (I know not how far I have transgressed the Laws of <hi>decorum</hi> in telling this trivial story of my self; but I hope the Reader will pardon this <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, it being so serviceable for my present purpose.)</p>
                        <p>Now the Charitable use I sometime made of this mistake of mine was this; That as I had not the least intention of begging a blessing or doing any act of a filial duty to that unfit person that then sate in the Chair, but to my Father only; and that therefore though a stranger had occupied the place, yet that duty was directed, intended, and indeed done to him alone, though he was not there to receive it: So I charitably concluded (and the imposing so upon my self was a great ease to my mind, being exceeding loath to find any more miscarriages in the world, in the Christian world especially, then needs must) that if a man did Divine Adoration to the <hi>Host,</hi> he being fully persuaded it was the Body of Christ, that Adoration did no more pass to the Host then my asking blessing did to him I never
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:42932:30"/>
intended it for; but that as this latter was entirely directed to my Father, so the former did entirely pass to the person of Christ.</p>
                        <p>This imposement upon my self was a great ease and pleasure to the charitableness of my nature, so long as I thought more carelesly upon the matter. But after making it my business to enquire more accurately into these things, I found that saying of <hi>Solomon</hi> over-true, That <hi>he that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth wisdom, encreaseth sorrow.</hi> Nor can I apologize for this mistake on this sort, but I must also thereby excuse all the Idolaters in the World that were serious in their Idolatry. For undoubtedly they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways took themselves to have a due Object of their worship; and what is <hi>Idolatry</hi> but the not having a due Object thereof? Wherefore if thinking we have will excuse us from Idolatry, no devout and serious Idolater was ever guilty of the sin; which is an enormous contradiction.</p>
                        <p>Besides, there is a great difference betwixt a sudden surprizal inevitable for one single action, and a constant repetition of the same mistakes; and still greater, if we consider what a loud warning there has been given in these latter ages against this so palpable errour of <hi>Transsubstantiation;</hi> men having strained their voices, and called to them not only <hi>ad ravim usque,</hi> but till they have spit bloud, and spilt their own lives by freely and faithfully testifying against that Idolatrous falshood. And therefore where men either take up or persist in this gross errour &amp; in the ill effect thereof, it must be now unexcusable Idolatry in the judgment of all men that believe the <hi>Eucharistick Bread</hi> not to be the Body of Christ; of which Truth there is as great a certainty as of any one thing in the world.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Nor, lastly, would that Evasion serve their turn, if they should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that they cannot be said to adore the <hi>Bread,</hi> because they do not think it there. For the case is much-what the same with the former, and needs no new answer. But I demand, Whether is it less Idolatry to adore the Accidents of the Bread, which they acknowledge to be there, or the Bread it self? And if the Body of Christ be not there under these Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, their act of Adoration falls upon the visible Accidents of Bread: which if they be of less nobleness then the Bread it self, their Idolatry is the greater. Besides, the Heathen who adored the <hi>Sun,</hi> did not think that Being which is really the <hi>Sun</hi> to be there, (for the <hi>Sun</hi> is nothing else but an Inanimate and unintelligent masse of flammeous matter) but thought it the glorious Godhead it self, which they worshipp'd as an Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual Power that created and govern'd all things, as I have already intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and yet no man will say that this excused them from Idolatry in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping the <hi>Sun.</hi> Where then is their Excuse that pretend they are guiltless of that <hi>Artolatria</hi> they are fallen into, because, forsooth, they think the <hi>Bread</hi> is not there, that is to say, that that which they worship there is not <hi>Bread?</hi> For the Pagans did not take the <hi>Sun,</hi> in our sense and notion of him, which is the true sense, to be there; though the external species of the <hi>Sun</hi> seems alike to both us and them, as the external species of the <hi>Bread</hi> seems alike to both the <hi>Artolatra</hi> and his accuser.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>1. The fondness of distinguishing betwixt an <hi>Idol</hi> and an <hi>Image,</hi> when they are both made Objects of Religious worship. 2. That nothing but what is essentially and infinitely Excellent is a due Object thereof. 3. That the absence of the Saints from their Images does not excuse the Idolatry. 4. The unlikeliness that there is any true Image of Christ, if it were lawfull to worship it. 5. But that it is unlawfull to worship it, though there were. 6. That the whole Decalogue is moral. 7. That the use of Images for Memory and Devotion was also the Plea of the Heathen. 8. That External Objects in Divine worship hinder the perfection thereof. 9, 10. Other material allegations against the pretended use of Images in Churches. 11. That there are many other ways of exciting Devotion in the people, infinitely sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing this of Images.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p n="1">1. THat also would be but a lame excuse for the worshipping of the <hi>Images of Saints,</hi> namely, That they are not <hi>Idols,</hi> but the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages</hi> of the holy Saints of God and Christ; but that an <hi>Idol</hi> is the Image of some <hi>Heathen Deity,</hi> such as <hi>Bacchus, Venus, Apollo</hi> and the rest, which were supposed to reside in the <hi>Idols</hi> themselves, whenas the Saints are with Christ in Heaven. As if any <hi>Image</hi> whatsoever to which <hi>Religious worship</hi> is given, were not an <hi>Idol.</hi> For there is no difference betwixt such an <hi>Image</hi> and an <hi>Idol,</hi> but that the one is a <hi>Greek</hi> word, the other <hi>Latin;</hi> they both signifying the <hi>likeness of something or other.</hi> And the making of such is but an harmless piece of art: but when-ever such likenesses or similitudes of things or persons receive Divine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or Religious worship, they do <hi>ipso facto</hi> become <hi>Idols</hi> in the worst sense.</p>
                        <p>Nor is there any sufficient reason why the Image of <hi>Bacchus</hi> or <hi>Ceres,</hi> being worshipped <hi>Religiously,</hi> should become an <hi>Idol,</hi> and the Image of <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Paul</hi> should not; or that the Invocation of the one should be Idolatry, and of the other not. For the worshipping of the true God by an Idol is Idolatry; wherefore the worshipping that which is not God by an Idol is double Idolatry. And this is the case as well in worshipping the Image of <hi>Paul</hi> or <hi>Peter,</hi> as of <hi>Bacchus</hi> or <hi>Apollo.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. For even <hi>Bacchus</hi> and <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Ceres</hi> and the rest were Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factours to mankind in the gratifications of the <hi>Animal life,</hi> as I have else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where <note place="margin">Mystery of Godliness, Book 3.</note> noted at large. But they were not infinite Benefactours. <hi>Mars,</hi> its likely, was a valiant Warriour when he lived on earth, but he is not <hi>Jehovah Zebaoth,</hi> God <hi>Omnipotent;</hi> and <hi>Apollo</hi> was a Wise and skilfull man, but not <hi>Omniscient.</hi> Wherefore they having not these Divine Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies in them infinitely and essentially, they are uncapable of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine honour.</p>
                        <p>Now there is the same reason for our Benefactours in <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Divine</hi> matters, as in those that are <hi>Animal</hi> and <hi>Natural:</hi> For the ground
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:42932:31"/>
of the unlawfulness of our doing <hi>Religious worship</hi> to <hi>Mars</hi> or <hi>Apollo,</hi> is not that they were Benefactours only in those things that concern the <hi>Animal</hi> life, but that they were not the Infinite and Essential Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours and Originalls of those perfections: And therefore S. <hi>Peter,</hi> S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and S. <hi>John,</hi> yea the blessed Virgin herself, though they were excellent patterns, and powerfull persuaders to the love of God and all the duties and accomplishments of the <hi>Divine life,</hi> and were singularly well accomplished therein themselves; yet they being not infinitely and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentially good and holy, they are as utterly uncapable of <hi>Religious worship</hi> (which in this case would become <hi>Idolatry)</hi> as any of the other. And they that would commit this Spiritual fornication with them because they are so holy and so good, would be as ridiculously impious, in my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension, as those Sectaries are that are reported to make nothing of carnal Adultery or Fornication with an holy Brother or Sister, but with the prophane and ungodly they will refrain themselves from that liberty.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Nor can the supposition, <hi>That the Souls of the Saints are not in the Images of the Saints, as the Pagan Daemons were supposed to be in their Idols,</hi> have the least shew of a solid excuse: For the presence of the Saints would make the act of worship seem more excusable, they being thereby more capable of such devout addresses and compellations. But these subterfuges are so slight that they are not worth the insisting upon.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The Apologie for <hi>worshipping the Image of Christ</hi> may be more plausible, in that he was truly God, and yet of a visible shape and figure. This indeed would be no frivolous plea for the lawfulness of making his Picture or <hi>Effigies,</hi> but will not reach the warranting us to worship it.</p>
                        <p>Besides, who knows what was the right feature of our Saviour? And then how ridiculous and foolish is that affection and pleasure in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating the Picture which we take for his, when in all likelihood it is neither like him, nor any one else? For it is not probable that the sad and aggrieved Spirit of our Saviour and his serious followers had so little to doe, as to concern themselves in having his Picture drawn, who was a <note n="*" place="margin">Esay 5<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                           <hi>man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief.</hi> But being that the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity was Hypostatically united with Christ's Humanity only, and that his visible Person was of a certain shape and figure peculiar and individual, and that it is pretended from this Union only that the right of worshipping his Image does arise; if the Image be not the Image of Christ, (as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens often, they say, that the <hi>Virgin</hi>'s Image is not hers, but of the fairest, though not always the chastest, of the City) but the Image of some body else, or an Image made at random, and it may be of no body that ever was, the ground of this warrant for the worship of this Image will fail, so that none can be assured but that he committeth Idolatry.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. And besides, though it were the true Image of the Humane feature of Christ, and this the pretended ground of the lawfulness of the worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping it; we forget in the mean time that Christ himself is not a due Object of Divine worship but as he is <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:42932:32"/>
Picture? And lastly, what licence have we to break the commandment of God, who expresly forbids us the worshipping of the Image or Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of any thing; nay the very making of an Image or Similitude for Religious worship? For the very Title of the First Table, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Honour of God and his worship, shews plainly that this is the sense thereof.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. And for my part, I do not question but that the <hi>whole Decalogue is Moral,</hi> and that we are as precisely tied from <hi>Image-worship</hi> as from <hi>Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery</hi> it self. For why should <hi>Moses</hi> mixe duties of such different natures in one short Decalogue? especially he copiously delivering his positive <hi>Laws,</hi> whether <hi>Ceremonial</hi> or <hi>Political,</hi> in other places. For the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding simply the making an Image is no precept at all, but only the prohibition of making an <hi>Idol</hi> thereof; and therefore those words, <hi>Thou shalt not bow down to them, nor worship them,</hi> are added exegetically for the avoiding all mistake, and plainly intimate that <hi>Idolatry</hi> is there for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, and not simply the making of Images or Pictures; or Images are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid to be made in relation to Idolatrous worship, as I intimated before from the nature of the Title of the First Table, which concerns Religion or our duty to God.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, why were these <hi>Ten Commandments</hi> more especially said to be <hi>writ by God's own finger on those Tables of stone,</hi> but that it was typically to indigitate to us, that it was that Law which is also writ in our hearts by the finger of God, durably and permanently; and that if every mans mind were wiped and cleansed from that dirt and filth that lies on it, those Eternal Characters of indispensable Morality and Reason would conspicuously and legibly appear there, and close with the Decalogue as a most just and righteous Law? We know that our Saviour has in a very special manner honoured the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> by his pointing to it as the way to <note place="margin">Matth. 19. 17.</note> eternal life. And the general consent of the learned of old hath made it an abridgment of the <hi>Moral Law:</hi> Nor can any one that duely considers the nature of it but acknowledge it an everlasting Law of God to his Church, even in the literal sense thereof. But in the behalf of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity (which requires a more Spiritual worship then ordinary) so to Spiritualize the <hi>Decalogue</hi> as to leave men free to <hi>Image-worship,</hi> seems to me a spiritualizing it into gross Carnality, and to be both as impious and ridiculous, as the spiritualizing the Commandment against Adultery into an holy licentiousness of lying with their neighbour's wife without sin or shame; which they say is accounted an high pitch of Christian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and perfection with some Sectaries.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. The last excuse that occurs to my mind in the behalf of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious use of <hi>Images</hi> in Churches is, <hi>That these are helps for Memory and Devotion,</hi> the mind of the vulgar being so gross and flagging, and so estranged from all sense and conceit of the Deity and Religion, that it must be fetched up by these palpable and visible engines, on which they can lay hold, and so bear up their Devotion and affection toward divine things by the helpfull artifice of these exteriour props. But this plea is in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with the Heathens and lapsed Christians: And that Apologie must needs look fallaciously, that will serve as well a confessedly-bad cause as a pretended good one.</p>

                        <p n="8">8. But truly in my apprehension, to fix a mans sight upon either <hi>River, Cow,</hi> or <hi>Statue,</hi> so as to take notice he does so, (and if he does not take notice of it, to what purpose does he look on it?) is the next way to exclude God out of his mind: For who can think of two things at once? Wherefore those Religious Symbols which will least of all take up our animadversion, or fix it to themselves, but leave it free to God, are the fittest for the more perfect worshipping of him; and (what is yet closer to our purpose) the having no Object in our worship but what is truly God, will be the safest way to lodge our Mind with him, and to think more truly, comprehensively and devoutly of him, then we can possibly while we pretend to see him or conceive him in any Statue or Picture whatsoever. For the apprehension of his infinite Wisdom, Goodness and Power, his infinite Mercy, Justice and Truth, and the effects of these, the vastness of his Providence, the sense also of his Ubiquity or Omnipresence, and that in him we live, and move, and have our Being, is a more lively representation of the Deity then the exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitest art or costliest materialls can afford.</p>
                        <p>But if any seek an external Image of God that falls under the Senses; behold the best and fairest is this <hi>All</hi> that we see: which yet is but a small matter so far as our sight can discern. What a pitifull representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then must any particular thing be, whether Natural or Artificial, for the setting out the Divine Majesty, and how unfit to pretend to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an Object, in any sense, of Religious worship? How far short must it fall of the inward representation in the Vertuous Mind, whenas that in the Mind does so hugely exceed the largest and fairest prospect the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:42932:33"/>
Eye can take of this visible Universe? Wherefore whatever is interposed betwixt God and us by way of Object in our worshipping him, is not an help, but an hinderance, to the perfection of that Worship.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. And if we may compare small things with great, (as the Analogie does in some sort hold) the Character of the Vertuous life of any Saint is a better and more usefull Image of the Saint, and will conciliate a greater love and honour of him, then the seeing of his Picture or Statue. For no figure, posture, nor colours, can decypher or set out <hi>Sincerity.</hi> For every artificial Feature, look it never so well and devoutly, is but the livelier picture of <hi>Hypocrisie,</hi> because it is not what it would seem to be. Not to repeat my former allegation, that it is not credible that any of the afflicted primitive Christians spent their time so Idlely, as to sit to have their Pictures drawn, much less the blessed Virgin or holy Apostles of Christ. Which mistake makes <hi>Religious worship</hi> done to their Images ridiculous, as well as Idolatrous. For it is a sign that none of these I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages are true, in that they all pretend to be so; as if all the Saints of God had been great admirers of their own earthly shadows, when there is no likelihood that any of them were. So entirely and universally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible and reproveable is <hi>Image-worship</hi> in Christianity. But to return.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. So far therefore (as touching the <hi>Deity)</hi> is this <hi>Imagery</hi> in Churches from erecting a mans mind to the remembrance of God, and a due and worthy sense and knowledge of him, that it sinks it lower, and fixes it upon mean and trivial objects; nay indeed, out of inadvertence and an heavy proneness to sensible matters, depresses it, plunges and immerges it into gross Idolatries: and (as touching the <hi>Saints)</hi> instead of warming it into an affectionate admiration of their vertues, makes it fall into such sins as were most zealously avoided and abominated by them.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. To all which you may lastly adde, That this plea is still more weakened in the case of Christians, there being sufficient Props and Engines, nay Screws and Pulleys, if you will, to raise mens Love and Devotion in that <hi>palpable and sensible Commemoration of the Death of Christ,</hi> the Son of God and Saviour of the world. <hi>God is Love, and he that abideth in love abideth in God, and God in him.</hi> What better sense, apprehension, or representation of God can there therefore be, then that of an infinite Love? And what better means to raise us to any proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable pitch of the sense of this Love, then the <hi>celebration of the Passion of Christ,</hi> who poured out his own most precious bloud for the redemption of the world?</p>
                        <p>Besides, the coming to an appointed place of publick worship at solemn times, the approaching and continuing there with reverence, the putting up plain and easily-intelligible prayers to God, the hearing of the Scriptures with easy and plain Expositions of them; certainly such duties and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances as these will bear men up more firmly by far into a sense of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, then the viewing any Imagery whatsoever. And if you adde the singing of Hymns or Psalms, whether with the Organ or without, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it be done well and tunably, it will excite the Devotion of the people much more powerfully, and with a more determinate sense and greater

Also domestick reading to people, or teaching them to reade, will make the presence needless of these silent Masters.</p>
                        <p>What want is there therefore of either <hi>Images</hi> or <hi>Idolatry</hi> for either improving our Knowledge or exciting our Devotion, or for the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our relapse into an utter oblivion of God and the sense of Divine things?</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p n="1">1. WHerefore their <hi>Pretences</hi> for <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Image-worship</hi> being but mere Sophistry, let us consider what <hi>Self-endedness</hi> may keep up such unworthy practices. And truly the plot cannot lie so deep but every one may easily see it that is not wilfully blind. For there may be driven the same trade that was in <hi>Jeremie</hi>'s time by the Idolatrous Priests of the ancient <hi>Babylon,</hi> such as he notes in his Epistle, <note n="*" place="margin">Vers. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                           <hi>As for the things that are sacrificed unto Idols, their Priests sell and misspend: in like manner their wives lay up part thereof in salt.</hi> And not far after, <note n="*" place="margin">Vers. 33</note> 
                           <hi>The Priests also take of their garments, and cloath their wives and children.</hi> In brief therefore, <hi>The End of Image-worship</hi> may be <hi>the enriching of the Priest,</hi> and all the abovesaid pretences and excuses forged and framed merely to keep up that gain. For unless there were some such Mystery of Profit underneath, it were a wonder that the Christian Priesthood should retain any such custom, that is so palpably contradictory to the Word of God, and so expresly and particularly against the Second Commandment, and so great an offense to sober and consciencious Christians, and lastly so huge a rock of scandal to both <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Turk.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. It is therefore not hard to imagine how they having erected the Statue of this or that Saint, of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> S. <hi>James,</hi> S. <hi>Peter,</hi> or the like, handsomely adorning them, and setting them out in a competent liveliness of personal shape; that they may teach the people (who are too prone to these Spiritual fornications, especially being animated and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldened
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:42932:34"/>
by the counsel or example of their lenocinant Leaders) not only to open their mouths to them in prayer, but their hands also in various offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings; having imbued their rude minds with a superstitious fear of the Saints displeasure, if they approach empty-fisted; and, it may be, by some artifices make the Images to seem to frown or smile upon them, according to the scantness or largeness of their gifts; or at least provoke the offerers emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by hanging up in view what has been given to the Image, with the names of the devouter and more liberal Clients.</p>
                        <p>The giving out also that this or that Saint has a special power for doing such or such miracles, for healing such or such diseases, for aiding in such or such streights or exigencies, were endow'd with such or such a measure of Pardons or Indulgences; how strongly would these surmises attract the devotions of the simple, even to the making Vows to them in Danger, and the going on Pilgrimages to their Temples or Chappells? where being brought into the visible presence, as it were, of the Saint himself, represented by his well-adorned Statue or Image, (either out of a conceit of some help done to them already, or in expectation of some fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture succour) they cannot for shame but offer at least proportionably to their ability, not doubting but the more liberal Clients of so good and powerfull a Patron shall not fail one way or other to receive at least a full peny-worth for a peny.</p>
                        <p>But they do not consider in the mean time, that the imitation of any peculiar Vertue in any of those Saints would oblige them more (<gap reason="foreign">

As any good Christian would sooner relieve a poor man whom by chance he found earnestly breathing out his wants to God in secret, then if he had begged relief of himself.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. We see plainly therefore what a <hi>Gainfull</hi> trade may be driven in the maintaining of the <hi>Invocation of Saints and of Image-worship.</hi> And if some such like prop did not uphold that Mysterious conceit of <hi>Transsub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation</hi> and the <hi>Idolatry</hi> thereon depending, assuredly so huge an Extravagancy, and so repugnant to Scripture, and contrary to all Sense and Reason, would not have the possibility of being any part of that <hi>Idea of Antichristianism</hi> which I am a-describing: For it could never get into the Church of Christ upon its own score, but as it served some other end or designe; at least it could not be retained there, when once seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously sifted, unless it were found very advantageous to the maintainers thereof.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. What <hi>Self-ends</hi> therefore, will you say, can be served by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the power of doing so stupendious a miracle, as the <hi>changing the Bread in the Eucharist into the very Body or Corporeal presence of Christ?</hi> Why certainly very great ones, and mightily advantageous to the Priest. For he that is supposed to have the power <hi>by pronouncing four or five words to make Christ</hi> Jesus, who is God blessed for ever, <hi>personally and corporeally present,</hi> cannot be well imagined to be streightned so in the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:42932:34"/>
effect of his intention, but that, Christ's personal presence being thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, he will bring to pass those very designs the Priest intended in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing it. As very few doubt but that he that can raise a Spirit to be as it were <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> in an hard streight, can procure of the Spirit to assist to that end for which he was raised.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore supposing the Priest has power to bring this real <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> down into Corporeal presence by such a divine charm, as they would make it; who can suspect but that Christ being <hi>bodily</hi> there, he will assist, favour and effect any allowable end for which the Priest by virtue of the words of Consecration brought him thither? I say, Christ being thus really and Corporeally there, (Body, Soul, and Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) and being thus visibly and personally offered up by the hands of the Priest, in the opinion of the people, for the procurement of this or that favour of God; they cannot at all doubt but that he, having such a pledge in his hand, will not fail of obtaining any thing, that is not plainly sinfull, at the hands of God. For if he has thus palpably given him his own Son, how can he with-hold any thing from him? Certainly, they that believe the Priest in the first, cannot easily misbelieve him in the second.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Wherefore the Priest might safely pretend that by virtue of this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering up Christ really and personally in the <hi>Masse,</hi> and of his direction of the intent of his own action therein, this Sacrifice will be available for both the living and the dead, for the sick and for the sound, for both man and beast; that he can thereby deliver Souls out of Purgatory, free men from the plague, heal cattel, drive away fevers, or prevent the tooth-ach, recover lost goods, cure the soreness of the eyes, give victory against a mans enemies, procure a good husband or wife, and what not?</p>
                        <p>Wherefore the Sacrificer being conceived to be invested with so mighty a power; if he will but be so free and accessible, as to be persuaded upon occasions to make use of it either for love or mony, may he not certainly have his choice? Whence it is plain, that if the Priesthood would enrich themselves upon this account, it is entirely in their power; and that they would receive mony for such holy performances and so pious uses, is not unimaginable. And therefore it is no hard stroke in this Picture I draw of <hi>Antichristianism,</hi> to suppose that the opinion of <hi>Transsubstantiation</hi> may be stoutly and tenaciously held up, for the upholding and increasing the <hi>Wealth</hi> of an Antichristian Priesthood. For if the opinion be false, as most certainly it is, it is the mother of <hi>Idolatry;</hi> and therefore the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders or Abettors thereof may be justly termed <hi>Antichristian,</hi> especially it being supposed that it is maintained for the love of filthy lucre.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. But it may not be <hi>Wealth</hi> only that is the End and Design of this monstrous doctrine, but <hi>the exaltation of their persons into a greater esteem and honour then can well be humane.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For <hi>to transform a piece of Bread into the real Person of Christ,</hi> is little less then <hi>to create our Creatour.</hi> And if the blessed Virgin, for being the Mother of God, does in their judgement deserve what they call <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

of that phansy themselves the <hi>Creatours</hi> of that very God of which the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> is said to be the Mother?</p>
                        <p>Certainly it would puzzle men to conceive a way of expression of sufficient honour and respect for such a wonder-working Priesthood, who in this one miracle, which yet is ordinarily and easily done by them, (though our Saviour was fain to groan for it when he raised <hi>Lazarus</hi> from the dead) who, I say, in this one miracle, of changing the dead element of Bread into the living Body and Person of Christ, do out-doe all the Miracles that Christ ever wrought, by this creating of him who was the worker of all those Miracles, and that even then when he does not cease to be; and (which is another great miracle) without making the Bread seem to any of our Senses any thing altered from what it was before. What honour or privilege may not they claim to themselves, that assure the people that they are the ordinary workers of so stupendious, so incomprehensible, and so impossible a Prodigie?</p>
                        <p n="7">7.

                        <p>For how holy, how sacred a person must he seem to the world, who so easily and so frequently can work so astonishing a miracle?

Wherefore though the Pretences and Excuses for the <hi>Invocation of Saints, the worshipping of Images, and the adoring of the Host</hi> be slight and triviall; yet we see the <hi>Self-ends</hi> of these Idolatrous practices may be very substantial and palpable: but both put together make up that <hi>Antichristian Fraud</hi> (and assuredly it is an eminent one) that is discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in this <hi>first</hi> and <hi>chief Limb of Antichristianism,</hi> which is the <hi>Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of Idolatry into the Church of Christ.</hi>

                        <argument>
                           <p>1. That <hi>Idolatry</hi> is the highest and most peculiar injury that can be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted against God. 2. That giving Religious honour to Saints or Angels, is really a reproaching them and blaspheming them. 3. The exceeding great Mischief done to the Soul of man by <hi>Idolatry.</hi> 4. That <hi>Idolatry</hi> turns men into bloudy Wolves and Bears: 5. And is the Mother and Nurse of the foulest impurities. 6. That it is the source of all manner of wickedness, and eternal death to the Idolater. 7. The great <hi>Mischiefs</hi> it doth to the Church of Christ. 8. How the Church is lessened by <hi>Idolatry</hi> at home; 9. And the spreading thereof hindred abroad: 10. And consequently the whole World injured thereby.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p n="1">1. WE will now briefly consider the <hi>Mischief</hi> of this horrid enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which reaches either to <hi>God,</hi> (as much as any mischief can reach him) to <hi>the Saints,</hi> to <hi>the Idolaters</hi> themselves, to <hi>the Church,</hi> or to <hi>the rest of the World.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The sin of Idolatry is the most properly <hi>injurious to God</hi> of any sin, it so peculiarly touching the right of his Honour or Worship: which Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour he will not give to any other, nor suffer to be taken from him. And indeed it is highly reasonable it should be reserved entire to himself, no other Tribute being competible to him but this. For God, who is that Infinite Fulness of Perfection, can want nothing; but we having all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of his fulness, and possessing nothing but therefrom, it is according to the sense of that Eternal Law of Reason and ingenuous Gratitude, as well as according to the express injunction of the sacred precepts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that there should be proper Homages of Divine honour peculiarly due to so Infinite a Benefactour, which to alienate or prophane by apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to any creature, ought to be reputed the most accursed and execrable Sacrilege that can be committed.</p>
                        <p>This robbing therefore of God of his honour, of which he every where professes himself so jealous, and so wrathfull a revenger, is the highest affront or injury that can be committed against that glorious Majesty of Heaven. Which point is so confessedly true, that it is needless any further to pursue it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The next seems more Paradoxical, That by the excess of honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and worshipping of the Saints we should <hi>injure</hi> them and abuse them, or by giving them over-much respect become guilty of disrespecting them. And yet it is in very truth so, if examined to the bottom. For the zealous and carefull yielding of that honour which is done to them implies our belief or opinion of their acceptance: but for them to accept of that honour or worship that is due to God, (as all Religious and Divine worship is) is to be Rebells and Traitours to the Divine Majesty, usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, or at least accepting of his Rights and Prerogatives, and, in stead of being Saints and faithfull Subjects of Christ and his Heavenly Kingdom, to be transformed into <hi>Titans</hi> and Giants or Children of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> that

would ascend the throne of God, and divide his Empire amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore whosoever pretend that the Saints accept of such Homages or services to them, do in effect proclaim to all the world that they are proud and vain-glorious, nay that they are Traitours and Rebells a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God; and thus instead of honouring them, do really injure them, reproach them and <hi>blaspheme</hi> them.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The <hi>Mischief</hi> that is done <hi>to the Idolaters themselves</hi> is very great and obvious to observe; <hi>Image-worship</hi> and <hi>Saint-worship</hi> debasing the Mind, and making it superstitious and pusillanimous, begetting in it a crass or gross conceit of things, making the spirits course and carnal and leaning towards Corporeal matters; so that the exteriority and palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the exercise of their affections in this sort toward Divine things inclines them with a greater proneness and readiness to be transposed upon other visible objects, and to fall quickly from caressing and embracing cold Statues and Images and such like sensible and palpable entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their Devotions, to the courting of warm flesh, and to the pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luting themselves with such sins of uncleanness as the ancient Pagan Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters were signally guilty of.</p>
                        <p>For indeed all such Ludicrous and Superficial Religion must needs leave the body of sin entire and untouched, and the inward Mind dead and starved; so that the full raines will be given to every impetuosity of the Flesh, and foul Lust and bloudy Wrath and Zeal for those Idols of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication (as it fares in enraged Gallants in the behalf of their Mistresses) must rule and over-run all. The crasseness, I say, of these Superstitions leaves the mind unmortified and unilluminated, but raises a zeal for them both ignorant, bloudy and barbarous. Which, methinks, is a sad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition for any Soul to be found in.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. But that this bestial Rage accompanies the love of Idols, (to omit several Examples in Scripture) is a Truth largely writ and testified by the bloud of those innumerable companies of the primitive Martyrs, who with so much reproach and so many kinds of tortures were put to death for despising or opposing the ancient Pagan Idolatry, as is confessed by all. And <hi>Idolatry,</hi> whether <hi>Pagan</hi> or <hi>Christian,</hi> will naturally dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them that are really devoted to it to the like cruel fury and madness. And though the cruelty of <hi>Bear</hi> or <hi>Wolf</hi> seems more the mischief of them that suffer by them, then the evil of those beasts themselves; yet for that <hi>Circe</hi> that metamorphoses men into these salvage shapes, few or none do doubt but that she injures their humane bodies. What a mischievous <hi>Circe</hi> then is <hi>Idolatry,</hi> that transforms the Mind into such beastly salvageness?</p>
                        <p n="5">5. And as for <hi>Uncleanness;</hi> that it is so close an attendant upon the worship of Idols, is also a Truth very often intimated in holy Scriptures: as in the Epistle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> where the Apostle expresly affirms, that <note place="margin">Ch. 1. 26, 27.</note> because the Heathen <hi>changed the truth of God into a lye, and worshipped and served the Creature more then the Creatour</hi> (or rather <hi>besides the Creatour;) for this cause God gave them up to vile affections; the women changing the natural use into that which is against nature, and the men</hi>
                           <pb n="57" facs="tcp:42932:37"/>
                           <hi>likewise leaving the natural use of the women, and burning in their lust one toward another, men with men working that which is unseemly, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in themselves that recompence of their errour that was meet.</hi> Also in the first Book of the <hi>Kings,</hi> upon the mentioning of the building of <note place="margin">Ch. 14. 24.</note> high places and <hi>Images,</hi> presently is subjoined, That <hi>there were also So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domites in the Land,</hi> &amp;c. The places are so many and so obvious where even <hi>unnatural uncleannesses</hi> are link'd together with <hi>Idolatry,</hi> that it would be needless, as well as tedious, to recite them. And therefore it is a very suspicable thing, that where <hi>Idolatry</hi> seizeth most on the Church of Christ, <hi>all manner of uncleanness</hi> will there be most rife also.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. But, methinks, I am too favourable in my charge against <hi>Idolatry,</hi> while I seem to restrain the <hi>Mischief</hi> of it only to <hi>Uncleanness</hi> and <hi>Cruelty.</hi> For the Authour of the <hi>Book of Wisdom</hi> does not stint the effects thereof to these, but enlarges them also to <hi>Dissimulation, Theft, Unfaithfulness, Tumults, Perjury,</hi> and what not? <note n="*" place="margin">Ch. 14. 16, 27.</note> 
                           <hi>For the worshipping of Idols,</hi> saith he, <hi>not to be named, is the beginning, cause, and end of all evil.</hi> And S. <hi>Paul</hi> in the above-named Epistle makes it the fountain of all manner of vices and wickednesses: which he doth not rashly, but very ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally conclude. <hi>For even as they did not like to retain God in their</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 28 29.</note> 
                           <hi>knowledge; so God,</hi> saith he, <hi>gave them over to a reprobate mind, to doe those things that are not meet; Being filled with all unrighteousness, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murther, debate, deceit, malignity, whisperers, back-biters, haters of God, despight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, proud, boasters, men of evil machinations, disobedient to parents, devoid of judgement, covenant-breakers, without natural affection, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable, unmerciful.</hi> So great a deluge of wickedness breaks in upon men by their being addicted to <hi>Idolatry.</hi> For Apostatizing from God by this hainous sin, God also forsakes them, as the Apostle intimates.</p>
                        <p>And besides, The sottishness of Idolatrous worship, that calls out the Affections to such gross and unfitting objects, does naturally lay the sense of better things asleep, and extinguish the <hi>true life of Religion,</hi> which is the renewing the Mind into the Image or similitude of God and Christ; which consists <hi>in an holy and peaceable love, and in a pure, chast and unpolluted spirit, unspotted of the vain desires of this present world.</hi> Whence the introduction of <hi>Idolatry</hi> into the Church of Christ must needs be the overflowing it with all manner of vice and wickedness. But that consideration belongs rather to the next point, <hi>The Mischief that redounds to the Church from Idolatry;</hi> to which I shall immediately pass, after I have but briefly intimated <hi>one Mischief more</hi> which falls upon the Idolater himself, and of which I think he will be most sensible, and it is only this; <hi>That he shall have his portion in the Lake that burneth with</hi>

                           <hi>fire and brimstone, which is the second Death,</hi> that is to say, that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Death and destruction that will assuredly attend all such enemies of God.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. The <hi>Mischief</hi> that accrues <hi>to the Church</hi> from Idolatry I have partly hinted already, namely, that it is the most likely way to debauch her with all other manner of vices, and does <hi>ipso facto</hi> transform her, who
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:42932:38"/>
should approve herself the pure Spouse of Christ, into the abhorred con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of an <hi>Harlot.</hi> To which you may adde those great agonies and aggrievances of spirit that the true members of Christ are cast into by beholding such abominable practices; besides their personal unsafety, and danger of barbarous persecutions, and those hard trialls and disquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting solicitudes that naturally will attempt them, as they are men consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting of mortal flesh and liable to all the evils it exposes them to; and finally the actual injuries, reproaches, imprisonments and multifarious Deaths that would fall upon the sincerest part of the body of Christ, for opposing, or refusing to partake with others in their Idolatrous Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ominations.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. And yet this is not all: There is still <hi>a very grand Mischief</hi> behind, and exceeding considerable, done to the Church by this fearfull sin of <hi>Idolatry;</hi> and that is, <hi>The hinderance of her spreading and propagating herself in the world.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is part of our Christian Faith, as we make profession of it in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, That there is One <hi>Catholick and Apostolick Church.</hi> Which implies that the Church has a right to be <hi>Catholick,</hi> to be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally spred over the face of the Earth; and that the true and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Character of this <hi>Catholick</hi> Church is to be <hi>Apostolical;</hi> That whatsoever Nation or People, or part of any Nation or People, profess that Doctrine and Discipline which was delivered by Christ and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, become immediately thereby <hi>part of the Catholick Church;</hi> and those that profess and enjoyn Doctrines and practices that are <hi>Anti-Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical,</hi> run the hazzard of losing the true title of <hi>Catholick,</hi> and of making themselves indeed no part of the Church of Christ. And certainly <hi>Idolatry</hi> is as <hi>Anti-Apostolical,</hi> as contrary to the <hi>Apostolick</hi> Doctrine, as any thing can be.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore the introduction thereof into the Church of Christ is the rescinding so many Souls from the body of the Church as are persuaded to entertain it. Whence it is manifest that <hi>Idolatry</hi> is as it were a <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene</hi> in the body of Christ, and eats so much away from it as it seizes upon.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. But this is not the sole <hi>Mischief</hi> of this kind done to the Church by <hi>Idolatry,</hi> viz. <hi>The streightning the extent thereof by the divulsion of those that were her true members;</hi> but as considerable as this is <hi>The prevention or hinderance from making them members that otherwise might be persuaded thereto.</hi> For it is very visible that letting in of <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> into the Church of Christ, will for ever, while it there continues, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude both <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Turk</hi> out of it, who are deservedly so great abhorrers of <hi>Idolatry.</hi> To say nothing of the <hi>Idolatrous Heathens</hi> themselves, to whom it would be ridiculous to preach, as the Apostles did, <hi>to turn from dumb Idols to serve the living God,</hi> whenas they might easily see afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, that it would be but the turning from their wonted Idols to the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of new ones.</p>
                        <p>It is a fearfull thing therefore to profess the <hi>Church Catholick,</hi> and yet by introduction of <hi>Idolatry</hi> to streighten it at home, and hinder the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of it abroad by such horrible Scandals.</p>

10. Which is not only a <hi>Mischief</hi> to the Church herself, in curbing her growth and eclipsing her glory; but a sad disaster <hi>to the whole World,</hi> (which is the the last evil issuing therefrom:) it being to them the most certain pledge of everlasting happiness, to become members of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> of Christ; of which there is little hope in either <hi>Jew, Turk,</hi> or <hi>Heathen,</hi> that are consciencious, while this stumbling-block is in their way, and that they cannot profess Christianity without the allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and practice of <hi>Idolatry.</hi> Which in my apprehension ought to be reputed a very sad calamity upon Earth.</p>
                        <p>Thus we have seen a competent Description of the <hi>First main Limb of Antichristianism,</hi> namely, <hi>Idolatry,</hi> brought into the Church of Christ, under pretence of honour to him and the Saints; with a discovery of the <hi>Falseness</hi> and Unwarrantableness of that Doctrine and Practice, and the gross <hi>Fraud</hi> and grand <hi>Mischiefs</hi> that accompany it.</p>

                           <p>1. That a multitude of slight Observances may amount to an intolerable burthen. 2.

                        </argument>
                        <p n="1">1. THE next <hi>Limb of Antichristianism</hi> is, <hi>The burthening and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangling mens minds with Scrupulosities in either unnecessary or hurtfull Observances and Opinions,</hi> laying an equal or greater yoke on Believers, by reason of the Multitude of these Rites and Superstitious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, then <hi>Judaism</hi> it self did upon the people of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and thereby frustrating that End of Christ's coming, which was, <hi>To put a period to such burthen some and unprofitable Ordinances, and to conciliate to himself a Church that should worship the Father in Spirit and in Truth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Which Burthensomness, as I have already intimated, may arise merely from the <hi>multitude of these Ceremonies,</hi> though the things may seem slight considered singly and in themselves; as Feathers, that are singly light, may by their number grow heavier then a masse of Lead: And
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:42932:39"/>
what a man may sometime doe out of Idleness or wantonness, to wit, stoop to take up a straw, or to divide clay or dirt into Squares or Oblongs; yet to be kept close to this task, how little different is it from that vile <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian</hi> bondage of being condemned to the perpetual making of bricks or gathering of stubble?</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Besides that every toy to which there is once a Religious obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation girds hard with those that are serious and consciencious. And such followers Christ expects, and therefore neither he nor his Apostles would burthen them with any thing but what was necessary. But we are exhorted rather <hi>to stand fast in that liberty wherewith Christ has</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 1.</note> 
                           <hi>made us free,</hi> and not to suffer our selves to be brought under the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of any servile and unprofitable burthens of Superstition. And our Saviour Christ rebuking the Pharisees tells them plainly, that <hi>they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped God in vain, while they taught for Doctrines the commandments</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Mark 7.</note> 
                           <hi>of men: Forasmuch as laying aside the Commandments of God, they held the Traditions of men, as the washing of pots, and cups, and brazen vessels, and the like.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Wherefore if our Saviour Christ was so tender in the behalf of his Disciples, that he would not have them superstitiously ensnared, no not in so commendable and easy an observance as <hi>the washing of the hands ever before they did eat;</hi> certainly it is utterly against his mind to have his followers intangled and enthralled in an innumerable multitude of less usefull Ceremonies: Which, be their natures what they will, yet if by their numerosity they equallize the burthen of the <hi>Judaical Rites,</hi> this general estimate is sufficient to discover it to be no inconsiderable <hi>Limb of Antichristianism,</hi> in what Church soever such an enormity shall appear.</p>
                        <p n="3">3.

Such a draught therefore of <hi>Ritual Ordinances and Dogmatical Observances</hi> I will now draw, as I dare ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to any indifferent judge, whether it will not prove an eminent part of that Mystery that opposes and defeats the purposed Ends of the coming of Christ into the world; which assuredly were to free his followers from Sin and Superstitious slavery.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. And truly observing how tender and carefull our Saviour is in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off the least taint of Superstition from his Disciples about <hi>washings</hi> and <hi>eatings of meat,</hi> and how expresly he affirms to them in that excellent pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, That <hi>nothing that enters into a man defiles the man;</hi> it will be <note place="margin">Mark 7.</note> easy thence to infer, that much less any thing that hangs upon him, or is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, can Sanctifie or make him holy.</p>
                        <p>Whence in the first place, though I do not lay the greatest stress on it, If we should suppose the Christian Priests to heap to themselves several sorts of <hi>Consecrated Garments</hi> for greater <hi>Ornament</hi> and <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie,</hi> insomuch that every Priest's Vestments would vie in number with the Vestments of <hi>Aaron</hi> the High-priest, and imitate also his in Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie, his Breast-plate, his Ephod, his Robe, his broidered Coat, his Mitre and Girdle; and the Bishops, not content with these, should adde
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:42932:39"/>
for the further adorning themselves (as if they had a mind to out-doe the Ceremonial Habiliments of <hi>Aaron</hi> himself) <hi>six</hi> more holy Ornaments, nay I will suppose <hi>nine</hi> more; besides the consecrating of these Priests with <hi>holy oyl</hi> on their shaven Crowns and in their hands; which become thereby so sanctified, that the more devout would eagerly and zealously kiss the hand of the Priest strait after his Ordination, hoping thereby to partake more fully of his devotedness and sanctity: What were this, I say, but to <hi>Judaize</hi> under Christianity, and to illaqueate the minds of men with such Superstitions as our Saviour Christ came to set them free from? Which intimation is sufficient to shew the <hi>Falsness</hi> and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesness of such an Oeconomy in the Church.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. But as for the pretence for such kind of <hi>Aaronical</hi> Ornaments, I can imagine none, unless it be the imitation of the <hi>Levitical</hi> Laws, which is a very bad one; those Laws being to be abolished by Christ. Besides that the Robes of <hi>Aaron</hi> were of a more <note n="*" place="margin">Appendix to the Defence of the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick <hi>Cabbala,</hi> Ch. 5. Sect. 2, 3, 4.</note> profound and important signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation then to be imitated upon any slight or superficial design: as well they as other <hi>Mosaical</hi> figures being prescribed according to a certain Pattern exhibited by God in the Mount; which being the <hi>shadows of things to come,</hi> do naturally vanish in this Meridian and Vertical Sun-shine of the Gospel. And therefore to bring in so many New shadows, is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>envelop the Church with darkness, and divert us from the rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of the meaning of the Old; which assuredly were all Types of that more full knowledge of <hi>Jesus</hi> Christ and of that inward and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Sanctity we have in him.</p>
                        <p>But that advantage which this erroneous Priesthood might seek to it self herein is this; That by these <hi>Histrionical disguises</hi> and <hi>peculiar adornings</hi> they may become more honourable in the eyes of the People, who are much struck with outward shews, I mean the simpler sort of them; and that their Persons may be accounted very holy, whose <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> is with such pompous Ceremonie, and whose <hi>sacred Unction</hi> makes it in some sort to vie with the <hi>Coronation</hi> of Princes. Could they be more through-paced in the imitation of that great high-Priest of the Jews, and adorn themselves with what in analogie should answer to his <note n="*" place="margin">

                        <p n="6">6. But so it is according to our Hypothesis, that instead of so great a good there follow these Inconveniences: That this Sacerdotal Pomp and Gayness to those Priests that understand the nature of Christianity is both a Scandal and a Burthen; to those that do not rellish Christianity in the right sense of it, it is to them an occasion of insufferable pride and conceitedness, and of great security and neglect of those true and indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensable endowments of the Christian Priesthood, of that <hi>Anointing</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">1 John 2. 27:</note> which will teach them all things, even that of the Holy Spirit of God, which is not lodged in consecrated Garments, but in those purer habits of the Mind, in the Inward man wholy and throughly dedicated to God, by perfect and real abrenunciation of himself, and of the flesh, the world and the Devil, by entirely giving up ones self to the sincere Love of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:42932:40"/>
God and of his Neighbour, to Purity and Sobriety of life, and to unfeigned Humility and Self-denial. Which real Accomplishments should be the Foundation of respect to the Christian Priesthood, not those exteriour Ornaments that may be the covers of a Beast or Devil.</p>
                        <p>And lastly, for the People themselves; As some are liable to be mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably deceived by those external Pomps, so others to be much offended; I mean those who are more seriously set upon the real duties of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, and find their wholesome appetite mock'd, not fed, with those out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward shews in the publick Service of God.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Which we shall better understand, if we make a more plenary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation of their Publick worship, and adde to the <hi>Consecrated Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of the Priest the dedicating of an <hi>unknown Tongue</hi> to their Publick Prayers and Offices, to the great disedification of the People. What spectacle could one behold more Antichristian? <q>To see a man in those Sacerdotal disguises, all of them consecrated and dedicated to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, himself having had both <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Hands anointed</hi> with holy oyl, standing in an anointed Church, and at anointed Altar, with his anointed Chalice and other anointed Utensils; whose <hi>Church-yard</hi> is holy by the consecration and benediction of sprinkled <hi>Holy-water,</hi> for the frighting the Devils from hanting that consecrate ground, and molesting the sleep of the bodies of the Dead; nay, whose very <hi>Bells</hi> of his Steeple are Christned and Chrismatized for the chasing away the foul fiends out of the Aire at the departure of a Soul, by their tolling or ringing: To see him in his holy postures now at the one end of the Altar, now at another; now turning his face toward the people, now his back-side; one while holding up his hands, another while holding them down, another while a-cross at his breast; now making with his hand a single Cross, now two or three Crosses together; now sitting, then standing, and another while stoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and kissing the holy Altar; now speaking aloud, then muttering to himself in a lower tone, but always in a tongue that is not at all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood by the People:</q> To see, I say, such a Sight as this, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it with that of our Saviour, <hi>The hour cometh when the true worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">John 4.</note> 
                           <hi>shall worship the Father in Spirit and in truth; for the Father seeketh such to worship him;</hi> It would necessarily extort from the Spectatour this just Censure, That these are either false-worshippers, or our Saviour's prediction not true, or else the completion thereof past in the simplicity of the Primitive times; or rather that if he would find these true Christian worshippers, he must seek them somewhere else: for here is neither <hi>Spirit,</hi> nor <hi>Truth,</hi> nor intelligible language, but all more dark and blind and dumb then in the very Midnight-shadows of the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Dispensation.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. And therefore (as I was a-going to conclude) as the more sottish people will be liable to be even brutishly amazed and amused by this unintelligible and unedifying pomp and spectacle, and be made the more obnoxious to all the Frauds and Tyrannies of this Unchristian, though over-much Anointed, Priesthood; so the more nasute will be tempted to look upon it but as a kind of circumforaneous Masking or Mumming, nor easily be persuaded that what is so <hi>Histrionical</hi> or Stage-play-like is
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:42932:40"/>
serious in any thing but in what the other Stage-players are, which is in the emungeing the people of their money.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore it would not be any wonder to see these better-spirited Christians abhor from these shews, as being so perfectly opposite to the ancient plainness and simplicity of the Primitive Teachers, who, as our Saviour himself, spake and did all things <hi>bonâ fide,</hi> and did not distance themselves from their flocks and charges by any <hi>garish pomp</hi> and <hi>multitude of sanctimonious dressings,</hi> but being even as they were, in a manner, saving that they were greater Examples of Faith, of Humility, of Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly kindness, of Contempt of the world, of Patience, and of power of Speech, and effectual Exhortation, and Conviction of mens minds for the corroborating their belief, and inflaming their affections with the love of true righteousness and holiness, (which was an unimitable and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deleble Character</hi> of their Christian Priesthood) kept and commanded the hearts of the Believers by this Authority of the Spirit discovering it self in the power of Reason and sincere Rhetorick, and sealed and tied all close to them by that indissoluble cord of a reverential and respectfull Love, which accru'd to them by the purity and unexceptionableness of their conversation; they <hi>teaching</hi> (as it was said of our Saviour) <hi>with Authority, and not as the Scribes,</hi> who <hi>taught,</hi> but <hi>did not.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="9">9. The reflexion upon which excellent Patterns will strongly tempt the better-spirited people to look upon these Sacerdotal pomps and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guises as a kind of Superstitious and Hypocritical <hi>Mummery,</hi> and to urge them in the earnestness of their zeal to condescend to approach nearer to them, and to lay aside their Masks and Vizards, and to deal faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and apertly, and to declare to them the Truth of Christ, and the Good will of God as it is revealed in his Word; for they profess they are willing to embrace it and to follow it, may they but understand it; nay they are hungry and thirsty after it, but find no food nor comfort in dumb shows: which if they will refuse to doe, they are those that cannot admire this way, but rather abhor it, and must leave it, and seek such Pastours as will deal with them in plainness and simplicity of heart.</p>
                        <p>For assuredly such gross and worse then <hi>Judaical</hi> Corruptions in a Church would force the most serious Believers to forsake the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity thereof, and drain it, as much as is possible, of the sincerest and best-disposed people of Christendom. And this I think is no small nor contemptible <hi>Mischief;</hi> the departure of <hi>Lot</hi> being a fore-runner of the raining fire and brimstone upon <hi>Sodom.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="10">10. But I have not yet evolved all the intangling Superstitions that may lie wrapt up into these Religious or consecrated <hi>Vestments</hi> and Habits.</p>
                        <p>For it is not impossible but that they may befool the credulous with the belief of some miraculous virtue abiding in them by the power of <hi>Consecration</hi> or <hi>Benediction</hi> of the Priest or Bishop. As that, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, they have the virtue of recovering men from Diseases; of fraying away the Devil and chasing him out of the possessed; of procuring remission of sins, both to Guilt and Punishment, by the putting them on; and of saving a soul from Damnation, and sending her safe to the blisses
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:42932:41"/>
of Paradise. So wonderfull power lies hid under these religious Habili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Which conceits notwithstanding are so ridiculously ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, that he deserves to be laught at that would seriously goe about to confute them.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. But some small pretence for the truth of them may haply be fetched from that passage in the <hi>Acts,</hi> concerning the miraculous virtue of the body of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> That <hi>from his body were brought unto the sick hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchiefs</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Acts 19.</note> 
                           <hi>and aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them;</hi> and from the virtue of <hi>Christ</hi>'s garment, the touch of whose hemme cured the woman of her Bloudy issue.</p>
                        <p>But we are to consider That <hi>Christ</hi> was the Son of God, and <hi>Paul</hi> a chosen vessel, and those first times were choice and peculiar times of the Church, that required such <hi>miraculous assistances</hi> from God for the planting of the Christian Faith: that Miracles are for the <hi>unbeliever,</hi> not for those that already believe; and that those cloaths came from or hung upon such bodies as were really <hi>anointed</hi> with the Holy Ghost, and that in a full measure; not rubbed or smeared in the hands or on the shaven crown with a little ointment, that gives only an extrinsecal Sanctity, fills no man with the Holy Spirit, much less to such height that he can work Miracles.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore to make the people believe that the <hi>Habits</hi> of either <hi>Priests</hi> or <hi>Monks</hi> have any such virtue in them, is nothing but an abuse of them into a mighty opinion of the <hi>Sanctity</hi> of those persons, the touch of whose very Cloaths is of so great virtue and Sanctity. I say, the End of this Imposture is nothing else but the extolling and magnifying the Priest and other Religious Orders of the Church, unless this esteem carry along with it also some pecuniary advantages.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. But the evil consequence is the cheat of the people into a feeble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of spirit, and a neglect (I say not, of the advice of the Physician, but) of his counsel who speaks to us <hi>to buy of him white rayment, that we</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Rev. 3.</note>

                        <p>For this furniture assuredly is infinitely more powerfull against the approach of the Devil or diseases, then all the holy Habiliments that the Wardrobe of the Church can produce; and will sooner quench all the fiery darts of the wicked, then whole pots of <hi>Holy-water</hi> squirted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him.</p>

As also upon his Corps laid out. 10. The <hi>Fraud</hi> and <hi>Mischief</hi> of these practices.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p n="1">1. THE mention of <hi>Holy-water</hi> puts me in mind of another <hi>Classis</hi> of <hi>Superstitions,</hi> which might be invented contrary to the Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Simplicity of the School of Christ, to the illaqueating of mens consciences, and misplacing their dependences upon Creatures more then the Creator, and to the extinguishing of that comfortable inward sense of his invisible, but omnipotent, Omnipresence, by interposing these vain and visible Objects, which have neither force nor allowance for those uses they pretend to; I mean, the <hi>Exorcizing</hi> or <hi>Enchanting</hi> (if you will) of certain Natural Elements, without any warrant of holy Scripture, to endue them with a Supernatural power.</p>
                        <p>As if, for example, the Priest should pretend by the <hi>Exorcizing</hi> of the Creature of <hi>Salt</hi> by the living, true and Holy God, to make it become an <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>Exorcized Salt,</hi> for the health of both Body and Soul to as many of the believers as receive it; and for the chasing away of every evil Phantasm and unclean Spirit, by the aspersion thereof: and so by the <hi>Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cizing</hi> of the Creature of <hi>Water</hi> in the name of the Holy Trinity, to endue it with a virtue of chasing away the Devil and Diseases and every disquieting thing out of an house by the sprinkling thereof, and should recommend the use thereof for the besprinkling their chambers ever and anon therewith, as also their sick folks, their fields and vineyards, for health and increase. The <hi>Exorcizing</hi> of <hi>Wax-candles</hi> into a virtue of putting to flight the Prince of darkness with all his Retinue, and of making them run away with fear and trembling from what-ever place they are lighted in. The <hi>Exorcizing</hi> of the Creature of <hi>Oil</hi> by God the Father Omnipotent, the Creator of all things, that whosoever uses it, the Troups of the Devil may be put to flight, and that he may never be bit by the old Serpent. Also the <hi>Exorcizing</hi> of <hi>Herbs</hi> or the <hi>Boughs</hi> of <hi>Trees;</hi> the <hi>Exorcizing</hi> of <hi>Bells</hi> and the <hi>Priestly Vestments:</hi> Is it not apparent that all these, and as many more else as can be intented of this nature, are mere Juggles and Impostures?</p>
                        <p n="2">2. But the Imposture would be more grateful and complete, if we had
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:42932:42"/>
some fine thing consecrated, that were more portable, and yet of a more universal influence, as also more durable and permanent then most of the former. And therefore the shape of some holy Plant or Animal thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orcized would be of sovereign use and content, <hi>the Rose of Sharon,</hi> or <hi>the Lily of the valleys,</hi> the <hi>Dove</hi> or <hi>Lamb,</hi> whose names are sacred to every Christian eare.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore a <hi>Golden Rose,</hi> impregnated with joy and gladness from the Benediction of the holy High-priest of this Church, and full of the fragrancy of remission of sins, increase of faith, (though the effect be never found) Divine protection and all prosperity, <hi>were a Posie to wipe the Nose of a Prince withall.</hi> And so the gentle <hi>Lamb</hi> made of some more flexible matter, and elegantly limb'd, suppose out of <hi>Wax,</hi> but exorcized into powers and virtues little inferiour to that <hi>Lamb of God</hi> that takes away the sins of the world, as being made able by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain sacred Exorcism or Benediction to preserve them that bear it about with them from all the assaults of the Flesh, the World and the Devil, from Pestilence, Famine and sudden Death, from all perils by Land and by Sea, from Lightning, from Tempests and from Abortion, were a Present for an Emperor or Emperess.</p>
                        <p>Several such Instances as these might be excogitated, all which I must pronounce to be against the faithful plainness and true power of the Gospel of Christ, and to entrench upon the Reverence of the Name of God, and to be a trespass of the Third Commandment, <hi>Thou shalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. Against which Precept I make account those <hi>Forms of Conjura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> do evidently offend that are found in Books of Magick, as in <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius Agrippa</hi> and <hi>Petrus de Abano,</hi> where those Divine appellations, <hi>Jah, El, Adonai, Elohim, Elohe Zebaoth, Elion, Sadai,</hi> and the like, are made the Elements of their vain and reprobate Art. Which is a manifest argument that the Priest's Exorcization in the Names of God and his holy Attributes does not excuse him from the guilt of <hi>Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> since the Magicians themselves use the Names of the true God therein.</p>
                        <p>And as for the more general Notion of <hi>Enchantment, Agrippa</hi> defines it to be nothing but <hi>The conveiance of a certain mirificent power into the thing enchanted by virtue of the words and breath of the Enchanter.</hi> Nor will the phrases or passages of Scripture excuse the Priest from this impiety, since this is both prescribed and practised by these Magicians. Their <hi>Pentacles</hi> which they hang about their necks when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure (which they forsooth for greater grace call the <hi>Pentacles</hi> of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon)</hi> are adorned and fortified with such transcriptions out of holy Scripture.</p>
                        <p>Whence it is plain, if any one would take notice of all the special Characters of such an Apostate Church as I am a-describing, he could not omit amongst other Titles to brand them with the name of <hi>Enchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> or <hi>Sorcerers.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. Which they might deserve upon other scores, which we have already intimated; as in that they teach people <hi>certain Prayers in an</hi>
                           <pb n="67" facs="tcp:42932:42"/>
                           <hi>unknown Tongue,</hi> which they direct them to say for such and such pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses. For what are these but <hi>Charms?</hi> And the making of <hi>Jesus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> (who was above sixteen hundred years ago crucified at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem)</hi> upon the uttering a few words, personally to appear flesh and bloud and bones, all mantled over with the thin cloathing of certain <hi>Panaceous</hi> Species or loosely-hanging Accidents, is a piece of <hi>Magick</hi> above the Witch of <hi>Endor</hi>'s and all the Historical records of <hi>Necro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancy</hi> in the world. All which pretensions being so Epidemical or general in this Church we do characterize, who can miss of notifying them by the style of <hi>a Society of Magicians</hi> or <hi>Enchanters?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For in that they are mere Pretences, and have no real effect, will not excuse the desert of so goodly a Title, the profession and endeavour gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Practisers sufficient right thereto. As he that has been casting his Angle a good part of the day into the River, and brings home no Fish, may yet be rightly saluted <hi>Mr. Fisherman</hi> or <hi>Mr. Angler</hi> at his return, though not without some kind of Scommatism at the bottom: And he that professes Physick, and has it may be as yet cured none, (but such as would have recovered as well without him) though killed many, is not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding by all men termed a <hi>Physician.</hi> And generally what men affectedly pretend to, though they cannot perform it, may justly by way of Scommatical reproach be entered into the particulars of their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, for the making up the whole tale of their shame and reproof.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. What grounds they might make shew of for such Incantations as these, I must confess I cannot so easily find. For the <hi>Bloud of the Paschal Lamb</hi> wherewith the <hi>Israelites</hi> sprinkled the lintel and two side-posts of their doors was not charmed first to convey a virtue into it of frighting away the destroying Angel, but was merely a present Sign, as also a Type of the sprinkling of the Bloud of Christ, who as a Lamb without spot was to be sacrificed in future ages for the sins of the world. Nor were the <hi>Water and Ashes of the Heifer</hi> mingled together with any Exorcism or Enchantment that we reade of in Scripture. Nor did <hi>Elisha</hi> charm the <hi>Salt</hi> before he cast it into the Waters to heal them, but he used it as a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance onely or sign in the healing of them: which Ceremonies Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity has nothing to doe withall, nor is there any reason to bring in any more of the ancient Types or Figures then are already made use of by his choice who was unerrable.</p>
                        <p>The ground therefore of such usages is none at all: but the pretence to such power as this, so strangely and marvellously to enchant things to such mighty uses, would make much for the honour of the Priest, who cannot but hereby seem <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, a very great and adorable person to the credulous people, and these Exorcized commodities would be ready mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with as many as had belief in them.</p>
                        <p>But the worst is, <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Temperance</hi> would be look'd less after, and <hi>Pots</hi> of <hi>Holy-water</hi> and <hi>enchanted Lambs of Wax</hi> would stop those inward living springs of the Spirit of God in the Heart, and help to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish that sense of Innocency, then which there is not a greater Tower of defence to a believing Christian against all the fiery and thundring Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery of the Prince of the Air.</p>
                        <p n="6">
                           <pb n="68" facs="tcp:42932:43"/>
6. These be the most gross and fundamental Superstitions, that look like <hi>Magick</hi> or <hi>Sorcery,</hi> which yet might be derived and deduced into various uses and practices, as in the <hi>Visitation of the Sick,</hi> in <hi>Extreme Unction,</hi> in <hi>Funerals</hi> or <hi>Burials,</hi> in <hi>Christenings, Churchings</hi> and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages,</hi> where <hi>Holy-water, Exorcized Oil</hi> and <hi>Candles</hi> might be frequently made use of, and some of them truly not without some considerable trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; as in <hi>Anointing the Sick,</hi> their <hi>Eyes, Ears, Noses, Mouths</hi> and <hi>Hands,</hi> nay their <hi>Feet</hi> and the <hi>Reins</hi> of their <hi>Back:</hi> the latter whereof may cause troublesome contests betwixt natural Modesty and Religious zeal in those that have a penitent sense of the transgressions of those parts.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>conjuring the Devil also out of the Infant that is to be baptized</hi> would seem a frightful thing to the Infant himself, if he understood in what an ill plight the Priest supposes him, while he makes <hi>three Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufflations</hi> upon his face, and uses an <hi>Exorcistical form</hi> for the ejecting of the foul Fiend, who is imagined very saucily presumptuous to take such timely possession of him, to whom he could not but see that Christ <hi>Jesus</hi> had apparently a better right, as being the off-spring of them who were already his, the Child being born of Christian Parents. But here may come in also (beside other Ceremonies) the use of the <hi>Holy Oil</hi> for the anointing him on the fore-head and breast, the putting upon him <hi>white Vestments,</hi> and into his hand an <hi>holy Candle.</hi> And, which is more holy then any <hi>Oil</hi> or <hi>Candle,</hi> the <hi>Priest</hi>'s <hi>own Spittle</hi> is also to sanctifie his Ears and Nostrils by a gentle smearing thereof on those places. And lastly, that all may be sound and wholesome, the <hi>holy Salt</hi> may also be put into the mouth of the Child, that his words, when he can speak, may be the more savoury.</p>
                        <p>Thus may the use of the first consecrated Elements, you see, go far, and make the Christian Sacrament of <hi>Baptism</hi> exceed in Ceremonie the Judaical, nay their <hi>Circumcision</hi> it self: whenas the use of that one Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Water</hi> were sufficient, and <hi>One</hi> dipping as significant of the <hi>Unity</hi> of the Godhead as <hi>Three</hi> are of the <hi>Trinity.</hi> Yet such large and prolix Shadows might Christianity cast, when the Sun of Righteousness grows towards his setting in the Church.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. And it is much if something might not appear affrightful to the Women in this approching darkness. For though it be a gay thing for the Priest to be thought to have so much power over the Stygian Fiend, as to <hi>Exorcize</hi> him out of the Infant; yet it may be a sad consideration with some melancholick women laden with Superstition, to think they are never brought to bed, but they are delivered of a Devil and Child at once; and that if their Child should die before Baptism, the Devil having got bodily possession of him, will certainly carry him thither where the greatest affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a Mother dares not so much as desire to give him a visit. Which indeed would argue the necessity of speedy Baptism to the height, but withall depress the afflicted mind of the melancholick Mother with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable anxiety.</p>
                        <p>The Delinition also of the Infant's Ears and Nostrils with the <hi>Spittle of the Priest</hi> may sometimes strike harshly upon the spirits of the more delicate; but it makes much for the opinion of his Sanctity, whose
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:42932:43"/>
spumeous excrement is of so sacred a virtue, and will gain also the prayers of all the women in the Town, that he may ever be an hail and sound man.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. But it were very unequal if the Load of Superstition should be lay'd wholy upon tender Infancy and our first entrance into this world. Surely that severe Goddess will make them feel her weight also in some measure who are in a way of departing out of it. And truly that Ceremonie of <hi>Extreme Unction,</hi> that pretends to make the passage more glib, to a man not Superstitious would make it more rough and troublesome.</p>
                        <p>The ripping up their Breast also by that sharp tool of <hi>necessitated Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> and then an over-reaching Satisfaction excited to the advantage of this or that holy Order, or the uses of the Church, will easily distract the mind of the dying penitent betwixt the care of his own Soul and the provision for his dear Wife and Posterity. But frequent aspersions of <hi>Holy-water</hi> shall be his dilute comfort; and he shall have before his eyes, so long as he enjoys the light, Assistants more cold and dead then those that have lien four days in the grave; the Image, suppose, of Christ on the Cross, another of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and a third of the Saint to whom he had particularly devoted himself; where he may, if he will, salute the Virgin's Idol in the very words in which the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> once did her. But if he would lay aside complements and speak the truth, he might take up the complaint of <hi>Job</hi> touching these liveless companions, <hi>Miserable Comforters are ye all.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>However in the Interim, what the frequent sprinkling of <hi>Holy-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> can doe, and making <hi>Crosses</hi> on his breast and forehead, or the ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging upon him the belief of every tittle the Church has defined to be true, (the Soul now so near her departure being more quick-sighted in those abstruse Mysteries) or the promise of <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Oblations</hi> when he is in the other State, shall not be wanting for the ease of his Soul: which in his breathing of it out, if he should commend into the hands of our Lady, instead of our Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> who is God every-where ready to save, that precept from the Priest would be flatly against the express Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of God, and it would prove a sad Catastrophe of his life to the dying man, to spend his last breath in so foul a sin as <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="9">9. But however, as if all had been rightly performed, the Body may be laid out in a decent manner, and a Crucifix put in the hand of the deceased, resting upon his breast, or at least his hands be laid a-cross in stead of a Crucifix, and <hi>Holy-water</hi> be duely sprinkled upon him; which what-ever virtue it may have to chase the Devil from the Corps, yet it will scarce wash his Soul clean from that last sin he committed, nor guard the house from being haunted with Birds of several colours and feathers, that ever smel out a comfortable refection from the fall of every such Carcass. So great a pother and clatter may <hi>Superstition</hi> make as well at the <hi>Exit</hi> as Entrance of men into this mortal life.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. In the midst of such Formalities as these, I must confess the Priest cannot but seem a man of marvellous might and power to the ignorant by-standers, such as have been nuzzl'd up in the belief of these Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitions, he administring such present and conspicuous Remedies for the comfort of the sick, as the Fiend-fraying <hi>Holy-water,</hi> the <hi>Images of the</hi>
                           <pb n="70" facs="tcp:42932:44"/>
                           <hi>Blessed Virgin and Tutelar Saint,</hi> holy <hi>Wax-candles,</hi> and the like, guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the very Corps, by the power of the Cross and the sprinkling of that Exorcized Element, from all the incursions of the Enemie and every evil Phantasm. But the dying person what benefit he can take by the having his mind distracted and called out to these dead shows, I must confess I understand not, nor can conceive but that they are an hinderance to that more pure and collected passage of the Soul into bliss; and are to the spectatours of these Solemnities the occasion of neglecting those better and more inward <hi>Amulets</hi> against the terrour of Death and fear of the Devil.</p>
                        <p>Such I mean as <hi>the Renovation of their Minds into the Living Image</hi> of Christ, and <hi>the triumphing over the power of Sin through the taking up his Cross in the mortifying all our evil concupiscences in our life-time,</hi> and <hi>the arriving thereby to the comfortable joyes and refreshments of the Spirit, and to a permanent and habitual sense of the Mercy of God through a lively Faith in Christ Jesus,</hi> (wherein we cannot miss of the assurance of the remission of our sins;) which are the most <hi>saving</hi> and <hi>most holy Waters</hi> that we can solace our selves with or ease the grief and agonie of our minds withall, the most precious <hi>Oyl</hi> or <hi>Balsam</hi> that can be poured upon an afflicted conscience. The breathing after which excellent condition is naturally stopped and stifled by a vain belief in these external shows, and by the relying on these multifarious Enchantments of a Superstitious and imposturous Priesthood, who would bear men in hand that they can carry a Soul through safe to Heaven by <hi>exorcized</hi> Elements and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical</hi> Artillery levied against the external assaults of the Devil; not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering in the mean time that the radication and growth of sin and disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience makes the Soul herself in a manner become a Devil, and will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitate her to undergoe the fate of that accursed crue.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p n="1">1. BUT we have leapt thus from one extreme of mans life to the other, whenas there are several things yet to be considered which may
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:42932:44"/>
make the middle space thereof tedious and entangled, may be unnecessary hinderances to him in his affairs of the World, may be sore afflictions and vexations to his Body, or disturb his Mind with grievous and sad perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. I will hint only some few Instances of each.</p>
                        <p>As, for example, if persons by being Witnesses at a Christening should contract thereby such a <hi>Cognation</hi> as, though it be Spiritual, yet, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Canons of this Church we describe, should hinder Marriage betwixt all the Kindred of the child that is Christened and their own; what streightness must these conceits cause in the marrying of a son or daughter, whole Neighbourhoods necessarily contracting such <hi>Spiritual Affinities</hi> by doing Christian offices one for another? The plot where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of could be nothing else but to drain mens purses of mony for the procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of dispensations from unnecessary Laws and restrictions.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Number</hi> also <hi>of Holy-days</hi> may be so many, and the observation of them so superstitiously and so strictly commanded, that it may be an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable burthen to the generality of the people, who live by their labour, and must starve when they cannot work. But the design is the same as before. For multitude and frequency of Transgressours brings in Mulcts and Fees to the Ecclesiastick Officers; though the smallest penalties must be very cruel that are wrung from poor Labourers that have but from hand to mouth.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Again, suppose a considerable number of men were tied up to the <hi>Abstinence from flesh all the days of their lives,</hi> by a religious or rather Superstitious <hi>Rule</hi> they are under, in such sort that death were more eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible unto them then to tast of Flesh, by reason of that hold their <hi>Vow</hi> had taken upon their consciences: What an Iron yoke would this be upon so many Christian Souls? How moped and frantick must such <hi>Monastick</hi> severities of diet, of lodging and watching make several of them that are entangled in the slavish fetters of this <hi>Babylonish Captivity?</hi> For which there is no pretence, but that they are so good-natured that they are resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to merit not only for themselves but for others, and that many such Rivulets concurring together may fill up that Treasure of Merits which the Church must have the keeping of, to sell at a good rate to those Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins that want oyl to their Lamps.</p>
                        <p>This is the <hi>publick Fraud:</hi> but the <hi>private</hi> is a certain <hi>Hypocrisie</hi> in these men, whereby they often shake off the indispensable yoke of Christ and the Rule of his Word, by over-valuing of, or craftily hiding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves under, the self-chosen Sanctity of these Antichristian Rules. And a <hi>further Mischief</hi> is, that the conceit of meriting thus for themselves and others puffs them up with pride and insolence, and makes them thereby more abominable then they who are under no such peculiar <hi>Rules</hi> or <hi>Orders</hi> of Religion.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. But there is another <hi>Abstinence,</hi> which urged with like severity and strictness would be equally burthensome to the generality of men, if not more, and is an Institute that seems expresly contrary to the mind of the <note n="*" place="margin">1 Tim. 4.</note> Apostle, who makes it a Character of a Church Apostatizing from the purity of Christianity, as he does the other also, namely, that of <hi>Abstinence from meats;</hi> but this is <hi>The forbidding to marry.</hi> Which
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:42932:45"/>
prohibition is not only against the express Law of God, but of Nature also, who, unless in some few, (who may have a peculiar gift of Chastity) is a severe exacter of this Tribute to the common upholding of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. And therefore with them <hi>Marriage</hi> cannot be well omitted, without very high penalties inflicted by that <hi>Nemesis</hi> that is interwoven in the very Law of Nature thus transgressed, which I will leave to Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians more accurately to discourse.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore, I say, to make prohibitions against Marriage, suppose to all <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> and to an infinite number of Religious Orders of men besides, restrained to the Rules of a <hi>Monastick</hi> life, and to make such <hi>Vows</hi> as these equally if not more sacred then the very bonds of Wedlock, would be upon Christendom as <hi>Antichristian</hi> a yoke as almost any Servitude whatsoever can be devised; and would put men and women, that were seriously set to observe it, but surprized in the undertaking it, (by either superstitious menaces, or fraudulent glozings and promises) into such Agonies of Mind and afflictions and distempers of Body, that the burthen would be unsupportable.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. But yet this designe would be sure to be driven on in a Church rancidly Antichristian, it being of so great advantage for the Ecclesiastical Powers. For there being nothing there devised with faithfulness, but for the Interest of the Church; let them that are ineptly serious under these <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastick</hi> or <hi>Coelibate-Vows</hi> be pricked as much as they will, as long as there will be held no breach of this Obligation but by taking of a Wife, swarms of men will come under the profession, who becoming in such a peculiar Religious way the members, or rather vowed Subjects, of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian High-Priest, are thereby really the Military strength of his Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchical Empire, and being either hardly or leudly brought up, may at a dead lift serve his designs in a more carnal or secular warfare.</p>
                        <p>But in the interim, such of this Note as are made more mad by Solitude and Superstition may of their own accord, or by virtue of their <hi>Vow of Obedience to their Superiours,</hi> being called thereto, approve themselves forward and zealous Assasins for the stabbing or porsoning of Kings, or dispatching any one that appears considerable against the Interest of this Church of Apostasies. Such a dangerous brood of <hi>Serpents</hi> and <hi>Vipers</hi> may crawl out into the world from the solitary dust and shades of these Monastick caverns, who may embitter the people, and poison the hearts of subjects against their Sovereigns, and, like the African <hi>Jaculi,</hi> strike through the breasts of Princes in a sudden surprizal, and spill their Sacred bloud upon the ground.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. But this use is more remote, and lies next to the bottom. That is more overly and exposed to sight, That the profession of so hard a task as totally to abstain from the greatest pleasures of the Flesh, upon a design of a more certain merit of the joyes of Heaven, and withall to be so clad as makes a shew of being mortified to all the delights of this world, upon a firm expectation of those future contents in that to come, cannot but work much upon the simple and credulous, as if these were the most serious and earnest soliciters of Religion that one can hope to meet withall, and that that Church must undoubtedly be true of whom they
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:42932:45"/>
profess themselves the devoted Members: and therefore being very numerous, and at leisure singly to assault every one, they would prove the most apt Instruments to captivate or detain the world under this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian power we describe, that any one can imagine.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. The multiplied <hi>Convents</hi> therefore of such Angelical Fraternities, how can they but be so many Fish-ponds digged out for the draining of the Wealth of the respective Nations and Provinces wherein they are made? where every one will be forward to help them in common that pretend to possess nothing in particular, nor to use any thing but for mere necessity or for Pious uses, they being so wholy castrated and mortified to the world. But professing a life so Seraphical, and gaining to themselves even a glory with men beyond what other Atchievements of the world will easily procure, their <hi>Convents</hi> may prove honourable Harbours of retirement even to the Nobler sort of Persons who are otherwise misfortunate in their affairs, or whose birth exceeds the proportion of their riches. Which Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations so largely extended is such a binding Interest with all sorts of people, that it is no small establishment, according to humane prudence, to the safety of this Antichristian Polity we speak of.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. To all which you may briefly adde, (for I would not be over-large) that so general a <hi>Profession of Coelibate</hi> in this degenerate Church tends much to the <hi>enriching</hi> thereof, it naturally falling to her share to be heir, these devoted Members of her necessarily dying without any Issue they may own. To say nothing of what monies may come into the Holy Pontifical Purse, when it is a thing of moment to dispense with any ones <hi>Vow of Coelibate.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>These may be the <hi>Self-ends</hi> that may be aimed at by this Antichristian prohibition of Marriage, against the Law of God and the directions of the Holy Apostles of Christ <hi>Jesus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="8">8. But the <hi>Mischiefs</hi> which I shall briefly intimate are manifold. For them that are surprized in their Vows, and seriously resolved, but na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally unfit, to keep them, there attends them a tedious servitude under indiscreet or at least severe Governours, and an irksom and sickly solitude. But as for others, the issue is foul and noisom in them, even to the turning of this false Church into a true <hi>Sodom</hi> and a cage of unclean birds.</p>
                        <p>For this Hypocritical profession of an Angelical Chastity with them will but be the mother of Adultery, Sodomie and Fornication, and of the bloudy and remorseless murthering of poor Infants as soon as they come out of the womb, or moretimely if they can rightly hit on it.</p>
                        <p>To which you may also adde the weakening and unpeopling of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom, and making it less able to oppose their forein enemies: This false Ecclesiastical Polity, which I am now a-delineating, being more so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous how without controll to domineer and tyrannize over the Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>party, then to secure the common Christianity from the Inrodes and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasions of Unbelievers. But, as our Saviour said of old, <hi>The Thief cometh not but to steal and to kill and to destroy;</hi> and therefore it is no wonder if he have no care nor forecast for the safety and preservation of the Sheep.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. But there is yet an harder burthen that Superstition may invent, and be either added to some of the <hi>Monastick</hi> Orders, or imposed as Penance,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:42932:46"/>
or voluntarily inflicted on a mans self out of a blind intoxicating zeal, the practice being applauded by this not Mother, but Stepdame Church, and it is in a word <hi>Flagellation</hi> or <hi>Whipping a mans self cruelly and bloudily for a Religious satisfaction, or else for Merits.</hi> A custom so harsh and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage, that it is more befitting the Altar of <hi>Diana Taurica</hi> then the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Christ, and has no precedent unless in those Religions which were of the Devil's own setting up, whose sport was his Tyrannizing over poor despised Mankind. Such a Pastour as this is not onely a clipper but a flayer of his Sheep, and exquisitely opposite to his Spirit who promised his followers that <hi>his yoke should be easie, and his burthen light.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="10">10. But such hardships as these, as they make a shew in the flesh, so they tend nothing to the right chastising and subduing of the corruptions of the spirit, and are but like the whipping the Cart and letting the Horses go free. That chastisement that reaches to amendment of life, and the bringing the Inward man under the obedience of Christ, is <hi>a resolute denial of acting any of the suggestions of the flesh.</hi> This will wound the sinning principle more home, and will really heal the Soul in the conclusion. But the other cannot well be countenanced but upon an Hypocritical affectation of a pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous kind of Severity, wherein this false Church may ostentate her own power over the minds and bodies of men, and take a secret joy in the relish of this wonderful Empire she has got over the World, even to a vile kind of bondage and vassalage.</p>
                        <p>But in the mean time such <hi>American</hi> cruelties as these may well hazzard the life or health of the abused Penitents, and will not fail to bring a very loathsom reproach upon the School of Christ, making it look like salvage Paganism and the Synagogue of the Devil.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. That also were a kind of Paganical injury put upon deceived Souls, and a great wearisomness and drudgery to the Body, to be ingaged in long <hi>Pilgrimages</hi> to salute this or that Saint's Image for better reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. But the Offerings tend to the enriching of that Church, and the Resort of <hi>Pilgrims</hi> to the enriching of the Town, and thereby to the conciliating of the affections of the Towns-men to so gainful a Religion.</p>
                        <p>But in the mean time the <hi>Pilgrims</hi> affairs at home are left at sixes and sevens, his Children to the sole government of his Wife, and his Wife to the oversight of the Ghostly Father, and what other humane Visitants shall put in for her comfort in her Husband's absence.</p>
                        <p>To <hi>Pilgrimages</hi> might be added <hi>Jubilees</hi> at the great Metropolis of this Apostatized Church, which though not so frequent, yet at their ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration would be frequented from the remotest parts of Christendom with multitudes of devout Strangers, upon belief of pardon of their sins for so holy a voiage. But the end and inconveniences of this Solemnity would be much the same with those of <hi>Pilgrimages,</hi> saving that this is more peculiarly designed for the replenishing of the High-priest's coffers.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. It were an endless business to reckon up all the manners of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious molestations which might be invented for the bodies of deceived and inslaved Christians, under the pretence of fulfilling the Laws of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity and of the Church: Such as <hi>Going a considerable way bare-footed and bare-headed; The putting themselves into cold congeling Springs, the</hi>

                        <p n="1">1. BUT to let pass these incommodations of the Body; Christianity may be made very uneasie and uncomfortable by several rackings and distractings of the Mind by unnecessary Obligations of the Conscience by entangling Conceits and Opinions: which also being innumerable, it were to no purpose to go about to reckon up all. But some few obvious ones I shall venture to name; such as <hi>The supposed duty of worshipping the Cross, the Images or Reliques of Saints; The conceit of communion of Merits; The intanglement of Vows; A superstitious trust in the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist, and in the power of the Priest's Intention in that and other Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; The belief of the necessity of Auricular Confession, and of the Assent to every of the smallest points of Doctrine held by the Church, though there be no footsteps thereof in the Scripture, nor any ground in Reason; The excruciating fear of a worse then Pagan Purgatory; and finally the necessity of Penal Satisfaction and Merit.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A man may pronounce these words without blistering his tongue; but if he once imbibe them as Principles obliging the Conscience, and be super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitiously intangled in them, he will sleep as uneasily by reason of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>settledness of his Mind, as if his bed were strowed with chopped hairs or pulverized glass. There is no redemption of the quiet of his Spirit but by taking of a lusty draught of that Soporiferous potion that will make him repose himself wholly on the faith of his Priest, to say and to doe just as he will have him without any disquisition or reasoning, and so to meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphose himself from a rational cautious Man into a mere passive Ass for the false Prophet to ride upon.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. But if he were seriously set to promote his own happiness upon the account of his own judgment and diligence, how would he be distracted in the multiplicity of the Objects of his Devotion? For if it be so merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to visit the Shrine of one Saint, it will be the neglect of his own Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to omit another. And if the Saints be so ambitious as to be pleased by
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:42932:47"/>
our Religious Invocation of them, the invoking one may it not bring upon us the displeasure of the rest who are pretermitted? And if I make one of them my Patron, why may I not suspect that I have thereby made the rest mine Enemies by slighting them, were they thus desirous of Divine Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours as we conceit them?</p>
                        <p>And as concerning their <hi>holy Reliques</hi> that are offered to be kissed by the devout, what pangs of conscience may there arise for our not cordially com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting our Lips to the meaner and more unlovely sort of them? How can a man sleep quietly being stung with the sense of so irreligious a piece of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civility, suppose it were but to an holy foul Handkerchief or some other old yellow linen?</p>
                        <p>There being so mighty power also in an <hi>exorcized Cross</hi> for conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of health both of Soul and Body, and for the driving away every evil Phantasm, (and the like reason there is of <hi>Reliques)</hi> what conflicts of mind must this cause in the seriously Religious, who, having been able, has not all this time purchased such a safeguard to himself and his house; or, being pinched betwixt the sense of poverty and quick urgencies of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, cannot resolve whether he had best purchase it or no, or when he has, is at a loss how many times a day he should crouch and creep to it, to draw that secret virtue from it which was lodged therein by an holy En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment or Exorcization of the Priest?</p>
                        <p>The same reason there is of <hi>Holy-water</hi> (how often to be sprinkled) and of <hi>Exorcized Boughs,</hi> and the like. And for the <hi>Communion of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> by being incorporated into this or that holy Sodality or Fraternity, how anxious would it make a man of his choice, that he may be best supplied, and how ambitious of entring into as many as he can?</p>
                        <p n="3">3. And for the <hi>Entanglement of Vows,</hi> how easie were it for men to be caught in them, as a Woodcock in a Net? What an harsh and slavish thing is it to be under the <hi>Vow of unlimited Obedience</hi> to one that I am not sure but may command me (under the pretence of an allowance from an infallible Power) to act what in my own conscience is against the Law of God, of Humanity, and of Nature? What various occasions also there may be of making sundry rash Vows, according to several Passions, Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences and Importunities, in a Church where they are so much in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion, and the performance tends to the enriching thereof, (as also the being absolved from the Vow made, by special dispensation) I will not here insist upon; for these things are infinite.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. There might arise great incumbrances of thought also from a <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious trust in the virtue of the Eucharist abused for such ends as it was never intended for.</hi> It is ordinarily called <hi>Mass.</hi> And if it had such virtue and efficacy as this Church would pretend, as of the delivering of Souls from punishment in the other state, and for prosperous success in this; for safe journeying by Sea or by Land, on horse-back or on foot; for Women that are barren, big, or bringing forth; for Fevers and Tooth-aches; for Hogs and Hens; for recovery of lost goods, and the like; what multifarious mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings of mind and anxieties of conscience would issue from thence in those who more carefully considered these virtues and privileges?</p>
                        <p>Wherefore where it is believed that by the power of those <hi>Five words of</hi>

                           <hi>Consecration,</hi> Christ does condescend to give himself into the hands of the Priest bodily and personally, to be lifted up and offered to his Father, for the succour and safety of the Good mans Sheep or Poultry or other meaner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns; how can the said honest man be quiet in his thoughts, believing the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resistible importunity of so stupendious a Sacrifice, and the sure effect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, (which will be more certain in matters of more consequence, <hi>Are you not</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Matth. 10. 31.</note> 
                           <hi>of more value then Sparrows?)</hi> if he have not his recourse to the Priest as far as his purse-strings will stretch (and his conscience will be often racked and stretched to save his purse-strings) upon every occasion of the sickness of his cattel, the delay of his wife's belly, in the danger of child-breeding or child-bearing, in his or any of his family's travelling, and the like, for fear he be accessory to any of those misfortunes that may befall them for want of timely applying himself to so certain means of prevention; and if the miscarriages prove Tragical, fansy his neglect the sin of Murther?</p>
                        <p>Nay how can men with a good conscience abstain from spending them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to their very skin, in laying out money for <hi>Masses</hi> for all their friends and kindred, and then make strict inquiry amongst the poor that may be neglected in that point? Or at least how can they shun being miserably dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted betwixt the fear of impoverishing themselves, and the compassion they bear to them that they fansy may be tormented in the other world for want of some such relief?</p>
                        <p>Such superstitious surmizes as these will indeed bring grist to the mill in plenty for them that infuse them into the heads of the people; but will grind and grate so hard against the believers of such principles, that they must live very ill at ease under this load of a false and adulterate Religion.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Which will again be hugely increased by another superadvenient Incertainty, and will cause a greater dissettlement and wavering in all such deliberations, where their propensions would otherwise carry them with more confidence to the succours of Religion and the Assistence of her Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. For supposing their Effect depended on the <hi>Intention of the Priest,</hi> our own both cost and devotion were utterly lost, if he out of malice or remissness should have his <hi>Intention</hi> diverted from the work. Which though it tend immensely to make the Priest great and formidable and a little God upon Earth, as having the power, if not of damning, at least of making the Salvation doubtful of as many as depend upon the sincere exercise of his function, in Baptizing, administring the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, and in absolving them from their sins, (which that he may discharge faithfully, men will be obliged not onely to give him his dues or wages, but to honour him by all manner of observance, lest he should doe them or theirs some everlasting remediless mischief;) yet it were a plague and fret of mind beyond all expression to the poor credulous Laiety, that were made to believe that God had put the power out of his own hand, and unless his Substitute would and intended it should be so, that the Almighty himself could not implant one into the body of the Church, nor the party implanted partake of the grace signifi'd by the Lord's Supper, nor receive express Absolution for his sins, though all things upon his own pious desire were externally administred by one professedly in holy Orders. Which must needs perplex the Religionist with a perpetual uncertainty of his own and others Salvations.</p>

The slavery and <hi>Mischief</hi> of such kind of Confessions. 11. The infinite vexation to the consciencious and ingenuous from the obtruding upon them incredible and impossible Opinions.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>ABsolution</hi> puts me in mind of the pretence of necessity of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing once a year</hi> at least (and that to the Priest of the Parish) all a mans sins, not onely actually committed, but the very purposes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, or propensions to the committing of them. Which might rightly be called <hi>Carnificina conscientiarum</hi> indeed, and is as base a piece of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude, and to as ill purpose, as if that all the modest Maids and grave Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons in the Parish should strip themselves stark naked, and in that manner humble themselves before their Priest once a year: Which would look like a piece of unsupportable Tyranny.</p>
                        <p>And yet this extorted <hi>Confession</hi> upon pain of Damnation not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal any thing, is not the stripping of a man to his naked body, but the stripping him of his body, that they may see his naked Heart, and so by the force of this Superstition break into those secrets which it is the onely due privilege of God Almighty to be acquainted with, who is the onely rightful <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p n="2">2. The pretence for <hi>this Confession</hi> is the necessity of <hi>Absolution</hi> by the Priest, which if a man, through his own neglect, have not, he must be undoubtedly damned. But that any <hi>such Absolution</hi> is necessary, unless upon the case of just Excommunication, cannot be made out by either Scripture or Reason. For when it is said to <hi>Peter,</hi> to the Church, or to the Apostles, <hi>Whatsoever ye bind in earth shall be bound in heaven,</hi> or, <note place="margin">Matth. 18. 18.</note> 
                           <hi>Whatsoever ye loose in earth shall be loosed in heaven;</hi> and, <hi>Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Joh. 20. 23.</note> 
                           <hi>they are retained;</hi> It is impossible the meaning should be, <hi>Remit</hi> or <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, Bind</hi> or <hi>Loose,</hi> whether right or wrong, I will ratifie all above, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Successors of my Apostles shall doe, nor shall any remission of sins be ratified without them, though they succeed onely in the external pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, and partake not of the same Spirit with their Predecessors. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:42932:48"/>
so large and accurate a Commission cannot belong to any but either to the Apostles themselves, or to men of a true Apostolical spirit, who are entirely of one mind with God, and therefore can doe onely what is right.</p>
                        <p>It being so rare therefore and so difficult a thing to find such a <hi>Confessor,</hi> it is an argument such an <hi>Absolution</hi> is not necessary: For neither God nor Nature are wanting in necessaries. But the <hi>Binding by Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,</hi> and the <hi>Loosing</hi> answering thereto, is of another consideration, and concerns the external Oeconomy of the Church.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. But to speak truly, That phrase of <hi>Binding</hi> and <hi>Loosing,</hi> above cited out of Scripture, seems not so much to respect <hi>Persons</hi> as <hi>Things.</hi> For it is <gap reason="foreign">

                           <hi>solutum.</hi> And therefore that pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage does not respect <hi>Absolution</hi> from sin, but the making of Laws and Institutes for the Church by the Apostles, which Christ says he would ratifie in Heaven.</p>
                        <p>But that other place <hi>(Joh.</hi> 20.) of <hi>remitting</hi> and <hi>retaining</hi> mens sins does undoubtedly respect <hi>Absolution from sin.</hi> But mark to what manner of men this power is committed. <hi>As my Father sent me, so send I you,</hi> (now Christ was sent full of grace and of the power of the Holy Ghost) and therefore he <hi>breathing</hi> upon them, says, <hi>Receive the Holy Ghost,</hi> and did most certainly impart it to them. And thereupon is derived upon them that authority, <hi>Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. Whence <hi>Erasmus</hi> excellently upon the place; <hi>Qui ex his posterio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus cristas erigunt, &amp; Tyrannidem quandam sibi vendicant, cur non meminerunt eorum quae mox praecesserunt? Toti turgemus mundano Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritu, &amp; tamen placemus nobis authoritate commissâ remittendi aut retinendi peccata. Tuere authoritatem, sed cura ut adsit Spiritus per quem Christus tribuit authoritatem.</hi> Which implies that where this Spirit is not, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is not; and that a man cannot rationally be either comforted by the <hi>remission,</hi> or dismay'd by the <hi>retaining</hi> of sin, when it is from such <hi>Ghostly Fathers</hi> as are devoid of the <hi>Spirit of Christ.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">5. Moreover <hi>Hugo Grotius</hi> does soberly and with judgment, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, interpret this place, of <hi>Remission of sins by Baptism,</hi> or <hi>Reception again into the Communion of the Church, if any be lapsed after Baptism;</hi> but <hi>the Retaining of sins</hi> to be <hi>Non-admittance</hi> of these into the Church who are not yet penitent Believers, or the <hi>Excommunicating</hi> them out of it upon a lapse worthy so great a Censure. But what is this to an <hi>Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary Absolution</hi> which must necessitate and squeeze out such an unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary and unreasonable Confession? St. <hi>James</hi> saith, <hi>Confess your sins one to another:</hi> whose style was ill directed, if it had been such an indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable duty to confess unto the Priest, and in such a manner as has been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, so frequent, so punctual.</p>
                        <p>This Anniversary Provolution therefore of a Penitent upon the floor at the feet of a formal Confessor, with eyes and hands devoutly lifted up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:42932:49"/>
him sitting in his majesty, is no part of true Christian Discipline, but (as <hi>Erasmus</hi> has well intimated) a piece of Antichristian Tyranny; it being a thing <hi>very loathsome</hi> and <hi>burthensome</hi> to be bound to unbosome a mans self to him of whose judgment, friendship or fidelity we can have no as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance; and very <hi>intolerable</hi> to be forced to speak of such things as we do not allow our selves to think of, and that before such as we may probably <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap>spect will conceive some sinful pleasure by the discourse of them.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. The Injunction therefore of such a punctual <hi>Confession</hi> has no ground at all in either Scripture or Reason. For neither did the Apostles nor Christ himself require any such particular and complete enumeration of mens sins, nor left in charge with their Successors to doe so. And it is sufficient more generally to confess them with a serious profession of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing and resolution of leaving them: wherein if the Penitent will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble, he may as well dissemble the number and circumstances of his sins.

                        <p>But if he profess his sorrow and resolution of amendment, and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of some weakness or melancholy cannot lay such fast hold upon the Promise of remission upon unfeigned Repentance, without this visible and palpable seal set thereto, of <hi>Sacerdotal Absolution;</hi> I do not see but a Priest anointed with the Spirit of Christ, and full of holy compassion to a penitent member of his Church, may rightfully and profitably, by that Authority which was derived upon the Apostles and their Successours, and by that divine power that assists the sincere exercise of his Ministery, seal to him the Remission of his sins, by pronouncing his Absolution, and so restore to peace his disquieted Mind; his sins being as certainly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned as if Christ himself in person had absolved him, he in such a case as this assuredly ratifying in Heaven whatever is here transacted upon Earth. Which I suppose <hi>Grotius</hi> himself will not deny, nor conceive at all clashing with his interpretation of S. <hi>John,</hi> he not pretending those he mentions the only occasions of <hi>remitting</hi> or <hi>retaining</hi> of sins, but the most notable.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. And as this <hi>Voluntary Confession in general</hi> to the Priest in order to the Penitent's Absolution is usefull and commendable; so likewise a Voluntary unbosoming a mans self in a <hi>more particular way</hi> to such an one as he could trust, and can presume fit and able for his office, to the end that he may have a more perfect understanding of the state of his Soul, and thereby administer more sutable and effectual counsel, is a thing questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onless of very good consequence.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. But to extort from every Believer every year, or oftener, a punctuall enumeration of all his transgressions in thought, word and deed, with all their circumstances, were but a vile and disingenuous pretence of insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting into all mens bosoms, for the getting out their secrets, of which the Priest may make his private advantage, or communicate to the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politicians such matters as will tend to the strengthening of their distinct Interest, which is, <hi>The conserving or promoting that Honour, Wealth and Power, which they affect in the World.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And truely by this means the secrets not of this man or that woman, but of whole Families and Cities, nay of whole Provinces and Kingdoms,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:42932:49"/>
and of all Christendom, may flow together into that common Cistern, or, if you will, Sea of Ecclesiastick Intelligence: which is the very Eye of Action, and the Soul of Conduct in all affairs.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. But though this would be a sweet morsel to this Pseudo-Clergy we are now describing, it would be sour sauce to the Laiety; not only in that it is a foul badge of an inevitable bondage upon them, to be constrained upon pain of Damnation at least once by the year to cast themselves down upon the ground before them that are so many fathom sunk into the Earth themselves, and to reproach themselves by ripping up their own faults accurately and punctually before such as they have no assurance of either their Candour, Judgment or Friendship, (and for a man to balk his own Priest in this case would be to brand him, and so make one of his chiefest neighbours his greatest enemy:) I say, besides the external slavery of the business, and the doing of a Ceremonie which may goe so much against the hair even with good and ingenuous spirits, a man may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to very great dangers and mischiefs.</p>
                        <p>For he that has the office of hearing men thus accurately and necessarily accusing themselves once a year at least, has a greater opportunity of injustly defaming them (by some tacit insinuations or somewhat ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presser notices) then is fit to be put into the hand of any man that is not a Saint upon Earth: of which sort we suppose in this Polity we speak of extremely few.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. <hi>Interrogatories</hi> also from such Confessours may, in greatest likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, prove to young men and women Lessons of sin and lust; and the knowing of the secrets of Families, the seeds of infinite contentions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Neighbours, and also betwixt those of the same Families. For it will be a hard thing for those that by this Shriving of persons know much of their Interest or disinterest, to hold their itching fingers from acting or intermedling in their affairs, or their other prurient parts from the soliciting the Chastity of such parties as they find hopefull and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; or not to be officious Intelligencers or Game-finders for such as pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue the pleasures of <hi>Venus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Besides that the vainness of their <hi>Penances,</hi> which yet must needs look like the right value of the Sin, may harden men into a conceit that there is no great hurt in sinning, and teach them to esteem the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressing of the Law of God as a thing slight, cheap and trivial. Whereas if the only <hi>Penance</hi> of sin were the pain of forsaking it, urged upon them from the certain expectation of that most direfull Judgment to come; though no other condition but that were annexed to <hi>Absolution;</hi> it would make men more sensibly feel the weight of sin, and make them make the greater speed to get from under the burthen of it. But to draw to an end.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. That also will pinch very hard, especially upon the more Intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al or Rational complexions, namely, <hi>To be bound in their Conscience upon pain of Damnation to hold whatsoever the Church professes to be true,</hi> while she in the mean time obtrudes such things upon mens belief as have no ground neither in Reason nor Scripture. For even in things that are disputable either way it is the fate of some men notwithstanding to be

in a manner invincibly inclined to conceive this part to be true rather then the other. What struggling and conflicting therefore must he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe to hold to the Authority of the Church against such strong and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal sentiments of his own Mind?</p>
                        <p>But if the Church should be thus Dogmatical not only in things that may, according to the sense of the generality of men, be either way, but conclude and require the belief of such things as are point-blank against either Scripture or Reason, and are impossible according to the Faculties of all men, who are unprejudiced, to be true; as, <hi>That one and the same Body may be wholy and entirely in a thousand places at once, and at a thousand miles distance betwixt all those places; That we may worship a graven Image,</hi> and the like; how unevenly must these conditions of Salvation sit upon the spirit of him that is not a mere sot? What recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of belief and misbelief, of hope and despair of Salvation must such an one be tortured with, that holds that his share in eternall bliss depends upon the hearty belief of the truth of the Church in all things, when what she propounds, according to all his Faculties, is not only unlikely, but impossible to be true?</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p n="1">1. AND now in the last place of all, to make up the full weight of this Antichristian yoke and burthen, suppose there were added the fear of a more then Pagan <hi>Purgatory,</hi> as I said; that is to say, Suppose the Church should determine That no Souls, unless such as are absolutely pure and perfect in this life, (of which rank there are either really none, or if there were, they would not be so immodest as easily to account them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves so) should upon their departure out of this Body goe into any ease<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full or blessed condition, but into a state little different from the torments of <hi>Hell,</hi> saving that they are not perpetual, but may be for many and many years, unless some care be taken to relieve them and rescue them who are in this sad and dismal place: which I suppose they would set out with all extremity of horrour to the rude people, telling them of many sad and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:42932:50"/>
ghastly Apparitions, who with wan countenances and mournfull tones have made known their extreme distress in this Infernal house of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and have implored their assistance in praying and paying for them as much as they could, that they might find ease.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Nor would they forbear the exaggerating this unsupportable cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity by all imaginable Mythologie: as namely, That the Souls of men were seen in a Vision, by some holy man of God or other, to be tortured in wonderfull manners; some standing up to the knees, others to the navell, othersome to the arme-holes, others to the very chin, in a stream of fire and brimstone: that others are run through with rods of Iron, and roasted against the fire like Geese upon a spit, the foul infernal Fiends in the mean time some blowing up the coals with their black mouths, or, to save their own breath, with a large pair of brazen bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, others lading up the grease that fries out of these roasted Souls and pouring it upon them again scalding hot: that others are scourged with whips of red-hot wires, others fried in frying-pans, others racked and turned round upon a wheel full of hot burning hooks: that others had their bowells torn out with the fiery crooked stings of huge over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown Toads and Serpents; and lastly, that others are put into vessels of hot scalding metalls: These dismal chambers of Death re-echoing in the mean time from their hollow roof the mournfull howlings and hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous shriekings of these tormented Ghosts.</p>
                        <p>These or such like terrible fancies of things did they but imbue the minds of the people withall, the belief of them certainly could not but screw the whole-rack of this burthensome Superstition, which I have been all this time describing, to the highest pitch that the wit of man can invent; nor could the flames of this <hi>Purgatory</hi> fail to prove that very Fire in which these slaves and vassals of the Mystical <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his hard Task-masters (I mean that Apostate High-priest with the rest of his adulterate Hierarchy which I am delineating) should droyl and sweat in, for the finishing their imposed tales of brick to build these sons of pride their Pyramids and Palaces.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Wherefore being stript and spoiled of all these comfortable succours that the true Faith in Christ <hi>Jesus</hi> does afford men, and being made to believe that the Passion and Satisfaction of Christ takes away onely the <hi>Guilt</hi> of <hi>Mortal</hi> sins, not the <hi>eternal Punishment;</hi> but yet, which is a great favour, that by the power of the Keys this <hi>eternal</hi> Punishment is turned into <hi>temporary,</hi> which every one is bound to undergoe, and satisfie either in this life or that which is to come, and that either in his own person or by some other, that is, He is bound to doe or suffer such things himself, or others for him, as the Church shall appoint or accept for satisfaction; which also is to be understood of <hi>venial</hi> sins; and lastly, that the spots and filth of sin inhering in our Nature must wholy be purged out by Satisfactions and penalties, which if it be not fully done in this life, it must be perfected by the expiation of Fire in the other: I say, if the people should be deluded by such Antichristian Doctrine as this, and have the sweet and easy yoke of Christ taken off from their neck, (which consists onely in sincerity, to the best of our power, to live according to the plain
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:42932:51"/>
and indispensable Law of Christ, and wherein we fail, to be assured that both the <hi>Guilt</hi> and external <hi>Penalty</hi> is taken away through the intercession of him who is our<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Advocate with the Father, and a perpetual propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for our sins) but instead of this easy and ingenuous service, should be fettered and held fast in that Aegyptian bondage we have described; into what a world of slavery and drudgery would mistaken mortalls be haled?</p>
                        <p n="4">4. How would they be forced to bestir themselves by these hard Task-masters! what trotting from Church to Church, from Shrine to Shrine! what howling and muttering before this Saint's Image and that Saint's Image! what knocking of breasts, and kissing of pavements! what fastings and watchings, not for correction, but satisfaction! what long stretching Pilgrimages from Country to Country, and from one end of the Earth to the other! what prayers and oblations to make the Image, or at least the Priest, to smile! what kissing of unsavoury Reliques! what Vows of Coelibate, and Abstinence from meats! what Flagella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Excoriations of the Body! what Nundinations of Pardons and Indulgences! what awe and servility to the Priest! what strict observation of Fasts and Festivalls! what vexatious Scrupulosities about needless opinions! what abject postures and rufull looks in forced Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions! what covering themselves with Religious habits! what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoning and confining to Nunneries and Cloisters, to Solitudes and Hermitages! what creeping of dying men into Monks Cowls, and rowling in beds of Ashes! what besprinkling with Holy-water! what Anointing and besmearing with enchanted Oyls! what hastening to enroll themselves in this or that holy Fraternity, to share in their merits! what shaving and paring away of Childrens portions for hired Masses and Prayers, to sing the dying mans Soul out of this imaginary Purgatory! In fine, what endless circuits of drudgery and labour of body and mind does this Aegyptian Tyrant put his slaves unto under the lash of this tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing conceit, <q>That the Death of Christ is not for the Remission of Punishment, but of Guilt; and that he that would goe to Heaven must travel thither upon his own proper cost and charges, must satisfie in his own person for his faults and corruptions in such ways as this adulterous Church has prescribed!</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Which is no method of freeing Souls from the pains of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> but of the inslaving them (as I have said) to a worse then Aegyptian bondage, and condemning them to gather stubble and make bricks, to work and drudge to hold up the wealth and magnificency of this imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his cruell Task-masters. Which is a Servitude as abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and Antichristian as can be invented or imagined. For it does ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely change the condition and nature of Christian Religion (then which there is nothing more free and ingenuous, and more professedly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to the yoke of the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Law) into a poor, pitifull, ignorant and servile Pedagogie, and makes it not only exceed the burthen of <hi>Moses,</hi> but (which I cannot too often inculcate) the very bondage of <hi>Aegypt</hi> it self.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. But though this Figment of <hi>Purgatory</hi> would be a very profitable
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:42932:51"/>
invention for the increasing of the wealth and power of this Pseudo-Clergie, and bring vast revenues to their Church; there being a like fear of it and desire to be rid of it, in Princes and Peasants, in Gentle and simple; yet it cannot be denied by any, but such as are past shame, but that it is a mere Figment, and has no grounds of truth at all in it, nay is contrary to what is most certainly true.</p>
                        <p>For it is assuredly true, and any good Christian may feel it to be so, that Christ has satisfied as well in respect of <hi>Punishment</hi> as <hi>Guilt;</hi> and it is perfect Non-sense, that the sincerely-minded should be justified by the merits of Christ's Passion and the excellencie of his Person, (he being that innocent Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world) that is to say, in a Forensal sense be esteemed as Just, and yet be handled or treated as Sinners. For it is as if a man should be acquitted and yet puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed for the same crime, at the same Court, then which nothing is more foolish or incongruous.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore it is manifest that there can no external punishment abide the Sincere soul after this life, (for I cannot pronounce any thing in the behalf of the unsincere, but that Hell it self is their portion,) no fire, no whips of Furies or Devils to afflict them, no infernal Bailifs or horrid Pursivants of <hi>Purgatory</hi> to arrest them; but they may pass free through all guards and scouts of the invisible Regions, and not one dare to offer to molest them.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. And that he that was sincere-hearted in this life, and did not onely believe in Christ, but to the best of his power and skill followed his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, and had a real enmity against all the appearances of sin whensoever they assaulted him, nor could be overtaken or overcome by the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of his Body without sorrow, regret or indignation; that this man should carry in <hi>himself</hi> any tormenting <hi>Hell</hi> or <hi>Purgatory</hi> in his free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from the body, is a thing impossible and unconceivable.</p>
                        <p>For he being freed from that with which he was so often forced to tugg, and in the midst of his greatest conflicts his life being comfortable to him through the sense of his own sincerity and through the assurance of the Love of God in Christ <hi>Jesus,</hi> what can Death be to such a man but <hi>Life from the dead?</hi> He that in patience can possess his soul in a prison, cannot fail to enjoy himself in the fresh aire; and he that can walk up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in fetters, may easily, if he will, dance for joy when he is out of them. So little fear is there of any such <hi>Mormo's</hi> or Bug-bears to the sincere Christian when he has passed out of this mortal life.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Some pretence indeed they may have for <hi>Purgatory</hi> from that pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage in S. <hi>Paul, If any mans work be burnt, he shall suffer loss, but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self</hi>

                        <p>But the grand <hi>Mischief</hi> of this cheating Invention is a blasphemous affront to the Merits and Satisfaction of our dear Saviour, and a Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall oppression of the consciences of the simple; but so great a scandal to the more nasute, that it were a strong temptation to them to misbelieve the whole summe of Religion, or any state at all of the Soul after death, but that she is mortal and perishes; these false Apostles having abused the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Doctrine of her survival after the death of the Body so grossely and rancidly, merely to the advancing their own estates in this life, and to the wallowing in wealth, honour and sensual pleasures.</p>

Let these passages then be their Letters patent, their grand pretended Commission of Infallibly interpreting, and never erring in any Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations or Conclusions, and we shall easily discover that it is a mere pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. For I demand whether this Promise of <hi>Infallibility</hi> be to the <hi>Whole</hi> visible Church in succession, or <hi>some part.</hi> That it is not an <hi>Absolute, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conditionate</hi> Promise to the <hi>Whole</hi> is plain, in that the parties of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom differ so much in matters of Belief as they do. But if it be to <hi>some part,</hi> where is the nomination of <hi>that part</hi> in these Promises where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by their Right of Interpreting may appear to the world? There is no <hi>Particular Church</hi> specified there, neither <hi>Greek</hi> nor <hi>Roman,</hi> neither <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covian</hi> nor <hi>Armenian,</hi> nor that of <hi>Prester John,</hi> nor any other Church else. Whence it is plain that no <hi>Particular Church</hi> can have any claim or right to any such privilege.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Again, suppose some <hi>Particular Church</hi> had a Promise, how does it appear that the Promise is <hi>Inconditionate</hi> to this <hi>Particular Church,</hi> and that it is not upon supposal that they will seriously and sincerely apply their mind to find out the Truth, and purifie their Souls from all those worldly and sensual impediments thereto? For this spirit of <hi>Infallibility</hi> cannot lodge in a body that is subject unto sin: For Purity of heart and life is the very Light and Crystalline Organ, the very Eye of the Soul; and to think of a privilege of <hi>Infallibility</hi> without Holiness, is like the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining of a promise to see without Light or Eyes.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore it is such an Hypocritical conceit, that a man cannot well tell whether it be more to be lamented or laughed at, for a Church to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that God has an irresistible design of making them <hi>Infallible</hi> to every Punctilio of Controversie, and yet not of making them <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>Good.</hi> But it is a sign they contemn or abhor <hi>Goodness</hi> as being contrary to their corrupt natures, but desire the privilege of <hi>Infallibility</hi> as being agreeable to their natural pride, and the boast thereof an instrument to bring about all their deceitful devices. And therefore we might adde to this, That it is questionable whether the Promise be to any Church visible, but to such as the Apostles were, chosen, sanctified, and faithful Regenerate men; for none but these are truly the <hi>Church of Christ;</hi> and if he make his Promise good onely to such as are his true Church, it is sufficient.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Moreover, be this Promise <hi>Conditionate</hi> or <hi>Inconditionate,</hi> we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be sure that this <hi>Infallibility</hi> is not <hi>Universal</hi> as to all Objects whatsoever. And therefore to meddle with such things as are not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to Salvation nor really edifying, were to go beyond their Warrant or Commission, and thereby to forfeit, or at least to have no benefit of, the promised Assistence.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. But let us particularly examine the Texts of Scripture themselves. The first whereof infers no more then this, That the Church of Christ shall never cease to be, that Death shall never be able to prevail against her, neither to extirpate her in this world, or hinder her of a glorious Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality in the world to come. For <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, <hi>Death,</hi> or <hi>Abolition,</hi> or <hi>The state of the dead.</hi> But this may be true of the Church, though it were not <hi>Infallible:</hi> So weak is this first Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>
                        <p n="9">
                           <pb n="90" facs="tcp:42932:55"/>
9. As for the second, it were well for the Alledgers if it were onely weak; for it is strong against themselves, and makes much for our Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis, who conceive this <hi>Infallibility to be Conditional.</hi> For reade the whole Context entire, and it runs thus, <hi>If ye love me, keep my Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and I will ask the Father,</hi> &amp;c. which implies there is a <hi>Condition,</hi> That <hi>they must love Christ and keep his Commandments,</hi> if they expect that Spirit which will abide with them <hi>for ever,</hi> (that is, as long as they lived; for so the word ordinarily signifies in Scripture.) And it is further added, that it is such a Spirit as <hi>the World cannot receive:</hi> Which therefore does strongly imply that it resides not in those who are worldly and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally-minded. Which <hi>Conditionality</hi> of the Promise is also infinuated in the third place alledged, <hi>When the Spirit of Truth is come, he will Lead you,</hi> or <hi>guide you, into all Truth;</hi> that is, he will lead you as a Man, not hale you or drag you as a Stone, or a brute Beast, which is not a free Agent. So that we see plainly that this <hi>Infallibility</hi> is <hi>Conditional</hi> where-ever it is.</p>
                        <p>And though I doubt not but the <hi>Condition</hi> being performed, the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise</hi> will be made good to all men as far as it is necessary to their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet these places are not the best that may be produced to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, the <hi>Promise</hi> being not <hi>General</hi> here, but directed to certain <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi> men in such circumstances, as it is evident that it is meant to them in particular, and does not infer any succession. For the men that he speaks to there he decyphers to be such as he was present with, and should be put in mind by the <hi>Paraclet</hi> what he had said to them when present; such <note place="margin">Joh. 14. 16, 17.</note> as were sorrowful upon the occasion of his departure; with other like circumscribing circumstances that cannot belong to any succession of men, but were proper to the Apostles to whom he then spake.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. As indeed <hi>Infallibility</hi> it self seems a Promise most proper to them, they being to lay the Foundations of the Church, and to build the House of God; which they having done in terms plain enough, as to all things necessary to Salvation, the Promise of <hi>Infallibility</hi> needs reach no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the Church for ever hereafter being safe, provided she keep but close to what is plainly delivered by the first Founders of her, nothing else need be obtruded upon Believers by way of Infallible imposition.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. And as for that fourth citation, where the Church seems to be called <hi>The Pillar and Ground of Truth:</hi> If we admit of <hi>Cameron</hi> and <hi>Capellus</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 15.</note> their ingenious conjecture upon the place, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>[The Pillar and Ground of Truth]</hi> is to be disjoyned from the precedent words, by a <hi>Colon</hi> at least; and understand also what follows <hi>[without controversie great is the mystery of Godliness]</hi> to be onely a Parenthetical <hi>Elogium</hi> of the Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Gospel, into which the Apostle was transported upon conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of those weighty Points thereof which he was a-delivering, <hi>God manifest in the Flesh,</hi> &amp;c. so that <hi>The Pillar and Ground of Truth</hi> may be <note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 16.</note> the Preface to the grand Points of the Christian Truth, which, that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renthesis being seposed, do immediately follow; according as it was usual with the <hi>Jews</hi> to prefix before such Fundamentalls of knowledge the Title of <gap reason="foreign">

12. But if you will adjoyn this Title to the <hi>Church,</hi> it was the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian Church</hi> where <hi>Timothy</hi> resided, which has vanished long agoe. And what other Church then, unless every <hi>Particular</hi> Church, can urge this place for <hi>Infallibility?</hi> which experience of contradicting one another does openly confute. Besides that the style it self of <hi>[Ground and Pillar]</hi> may not signifie certain performance, but the duty what they ought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form: As when the Apostles are called the <hi>Light of the world,</hi> and <hi>the</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Matth. 5. 13, 14.</note> 
                           <hi>Salt of the earth;</hi> which onely signifies what they ought to be, not what they were necessitated to be: For those that ought to be thus, may not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding hide their Talent, or grow unsavoury through their own fault; as it fared in <hi>Judas,</hi> and in all his succession of false Apostles, which call themselves the Servants, but are the betrayers, of the Lord <hi>Jesus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="13">13. But lastly, Suppose that the <hi>Church</hi> then <hi>in general</hi> were here un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood; it does not follow, That because that Primaeval and Apostolical Church should by a peremptory design of Providence have engraven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it or exhibit to the world as Articles of belief nothing but what was true, that the Church in succession should always doe the like. For there was a prime care taken that the first establishment of the Church should be in truth and solidity; but that being done, which was sufficient for the after-carrying on the affairs of the Church in a right way by free Agents, the success should afterwards lie upon their industry and fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, at least so far as that by no miraculous and supernatural force they should be assisted or driven on to keep things pure and intemerate. And that was sufficient for the Church, I think, which is thought sufficient for every particular man, namely, That the Christian Doctrines and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts being faithfully laid down in the Evangelists and other Writings of the Apostles, they might (that usual Grace of God which is not irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistible assisting them) frame their lives and beliefs accordingly in those things that are plain: And all are so that are necessary to Salvation. Which Rule if it had been kept to, no Error had crept into the Church to this very day.</p>
                        <p n="14">14. Which last Answer will contribute something towards an Answer to the last place alledged; for it seems onely to contain a description of a special provision of God for the rightly settling his Truth in the first Ages of the Church. To which purpose he appointed not onely <hi>Pastours</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi> (which Functions continue still) but <hi>Apostles</hi> having a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular mission from Christ himself, who breathed into them the Spirit of Truth; as also <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Evangelists,</hi> men in a special manner in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired and assisted to erect the Fabrick of the Church according to the will and purpose of Christ, who then in an extraordinary manner did su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pervise all by a miraculous assistence of his Spirit. And therefore what-ever was wrote for the publick use of the Church, while any of those unto whom our Saviour Christ said that <hi>the Spirit should abide with them for ever, which should lead them into all Truth,</hi> were alive, or was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by them, is really of certain and infallible authority; but what-ever after-Inventions or Super-additions there were in the Church, they are to be measured by this unerring Rule.</p>

These <hi>unerring</hi> Pastors therefore and Teachers, Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, were not a promise to all Successions, but an extraordinary gift, as the Text it self imports, which Christ at that time, namely, at his solemn Coronation or Triumph ascending above all Heavens, that he <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 10.</note> might fill all things, cast down as a Royal Largess upon his Church, for the speedy completement of her, for her growing up into the unity of the Faith and Knowledge of Christ, and that she might not be carried about with every wind of Doctrine, but adhere to that onely that was delivered by those Heavenly-inspired and miraculously-assisted Ministers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel. The acknowledgement whereof, I conceive, had been the onely sure means to keep the Church in Unity for ever; whenas the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to an <hi>Infallibility</hi> in the succeeding Church, where indeed it was not, and the taking upon them thereupon to impose things with equal autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to the Apostles themselves, would naturally prove the fountain of all Error, Schism and Confusion.</p>

For they might preserve the Writings of either by a diligent comparing of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies upon every transcription; besides that there might be a special watchfulness of Providence over these Holy Writings, for the conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of them from any material blemishes, as being so exceeding ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for the continuance of those Truths that were published by such men as (accordingly as I have already intimated) were Divinely and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly inspired.</p>
                        <p>And that there were such Writings, sufficient for the conveyance of the knowledge of Christ, written by them that were infallible Witnesses of the Truth, and that we may be assured that those which commonly bear the Title of them are they, I have without any recourse to the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of the Church</hi> so plainly demonstrated in my <hi>Explanation of the</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Book 7. chap. 10 &amp; 11.</note> 
                           <hi>Mystery of Godliness,</hi> that I think it needless to say any thing further of it in this place.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. In the second place they will pretend, <hi>That the Church must be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, or else there will want an Infallible Judge of Controversies; nay there will not be so much as any Authority in the Church to order the affairs thereof.</hi> But the Answer is easie and brief; That there is no want of any such <hi>Infallible Judge,</hi> and therefore not of the Churche's <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility;</hi> for the Scripture is a Sufficient Rule of Faith to all that have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, whether Learned or unlearned, in things necessary to Salvation: and That the belief and practice of these will carry a man to Heaven.</p>
                        <p>The Spirit of God therefore is the onely <hi>Infallible Judge</hi> here, and has declared as plainly as any successive Judges can, in those things that are necessary to Life and Salvation, what is to be believed and to be done: Which if we believe and practise in particular, and do also in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and implicitly believe and stand in a readiness to obey the rest of the Scripture, when the sense thereof appears to us, we are in a safe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and need not doubt but it will go well with us in the other State. For it is manifest that what is necessary, is plain in the Word of God to all men; otherwise Salvation were not sufficiently revealed to the world, and what we above recited out of St. <hi>Paul</hi> were not true, nor the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God sufficiently watchful in the laying the <hi>first</hi> Foundations of his Church.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. For if the Scripture were not a Sufficient Infallible evidence of all
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:42932:57"/>
necessary Truths, God would have afterwards raised other persons of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical purity in conversation, and with the like power of working Miracles, to have made a Supplement to the former, (which yet was never done;) or else those other necessary Truths, taught indeed by the first Apostles, but not written by them, had been committed to <hi>Tradition:</hi> which had been a very lubricous and perillous way, and unlikely to be taken by Divine Providence.</p>
                        <p>But if any such way had been taken, certainly the Scripture it self, in which all men are agreed, would have pointed it out to us, (as also if there had been any Interpreter instituted) that there might be infallibly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to us what remains necessary to our eternal safety. But the Scripture being silent herein, it openly declares it self to be Sufficient to all such as with sincerity and care apply themselves to the understanding of it: as certainly every man considering that his eternal Salvation lies upon it will be enforced to doe in his own behalf; whenas if others interpret for him, they may doe it more remissly or more fraudulently.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Besides that, it is a very unskilfull and inept desire that there should be any such <hi>Infallible Judge,</hi> that has concluded all Controversies to our hands already. For that would prevent or forestall that privacy and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity of converse which God has with those Souls that are more dear to him, who does in a special manner assure them of such Conclusions as are not to be reached at by every hand. But when the <hi>Infallible</hi> Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church has passed, all mens assurances will be alike, and God will have, as it were, given the staff out of his own hands. Wherefore there being no external <hi>Infallible Judge</hi> for the Interpreting obscure places in Scripture, God's right of his dispensing his special favours is preserved, and men of a more devout and Intellectual spirit are divinely employed, and earnestly engaged to extraordinary piety and holiness, that they may win the favour of that inward Infallible Interpreter, even of that Holy Spirit, which the World cannot receive, and by the light of his assistence be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to reach the true sense of those Writings which himself dictated to the Apostles and other Holy men of God.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. And lastly, <hi>That the want of Infallibility will take away the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Church,</hi> is a very weak Inference. For her Authority is entire in the urging those Truths and Duties in Scripture that are plain to all men, even to such as do not in the least dream that they are <hi>Infallible:</hi> And those that are thus plain are such as are the most useful for our safe conduct to Heaven. And for those Doctrines that be more obscure, if they be withall useful and edifying, as also Rites and Ceremonies, the Church has Authority, though she be not Infallible, to declare them and appoint them. <hi>Let all things be done decently, and in order.</hi> But how she is to behave her self to Dissenters, having spoke of that more copiously else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, <note place="margin">2 Cor. 14. 40.</note> I shall not here so much as touch upon it.</p>
                        <p>I will onely adde, That in things that are really disputable I conceive it is the duty of every one, whatever his private judgment and inclinations otherwise would be, to compromise with the Authority of the Church, and for Peace and Order sake to be concluded by their Determinations.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Now what has been already suggested will serve to null or enervate
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:42932:57"/>
a third Sophism. For it seems a plausible Objection against the Scripture alone being sufficient to guide us and rule us without a publick Infallible Interpreter, <hi>That this were as if one should contend that the Law alone in Civil matters were sufficient without a publick Judge.</hi> For besides what we above insinuated, That a <hi>plain Law</hi> (and such we averre the Scripture to be in matters necessary to Salvation) may want no Judge, where the Conscience finds it self upon pain of Damnation obliged to understand it aright; we further suggest, That the urging or pressing of the Law of Christ by a publick Minister, Interpreter, or Declarer of the sentence of his Law, so far as it is plainly his to all unprejudiced Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings as well unlearned as learned, is not denied by those that contend that the Scripture is the sole Rule of Faith. And for my own part (as I said before) in places that are not thus plain, if such Interpretations be made as are not repugnant to other plain Texts of Scripture, but tend to the promotion of the Ends of the Gospel, which I have elsewhere speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, I hope no man shall offend God, but doe his dutie to the Church, in compromising with them in their sentiments of things in such circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances as these. For they are supposed conscienciously and in the Fear of God to have interpreted the Scripture, and not for their own ends or carnal satisfaction in any thing. And questionless in this case they can shew their Commission, and that they act by Authority. <hi>Let all things be done to edification.</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 26.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>But that, <hi>because every Civil controversy must be determined by a Judge, therefore there must be an Infallible determinative Judge of all the nice and unprofitable controversies that emerge amongst Christians about Scripture and Religion,</hi> is but a weak and lame Illation. For <hi>Civil</hi> controversies cannot be undecided without injury to some party: but no man is injured by not having those unprofitable, at least unneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, questions determined; for they may hold their several opinions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wronging one another, if they will but keep to that known Law of Christ, that Royal Law of Charity. Nay the deciding such contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies by a pretended Infallible Judge were a vast wrong to one party, it galling their consciences, and streightning their liberty, and making the way to Heaven narrower then Christ has made it. For so does this Infallible Judge that imposes his Determinations on men upon pain of eternal Damnation. But God of his infinite wisedom and mercy has not given the least Intimation for any such Usurpation. And therefore this <hi>Infallible Judge</hi> being not appointed by God, and being unappoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table by man, the Scripture alone, and not these pretended Infallible decisions, must be the Rule of our belief.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. The fourth and last pretence is, <hi>That unless the Sense of Scripture be determined by the Infallibility of the Church, every private Spirit must be Judge of the meaning thereof; nay and, which is worse, be Judge of the Church, and thereby superiour to the Church: then which nothing can be more wild and extravagant.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This seems a big difficulty at first: But I answer, That every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular man should judge for himself, he has a <hi>Commission</hi> from the very Word of God, nay, I may say, a <hi>Command:</hi> As where he is bid to <hi>try</hi>

Acts 17.</note> for <hi>searching the Scripture,</hi> and <hi>trying</hi> whether the things that <hi>Paul,</hi> even an inspired and chosen vessel of God, had taught them, were true or no. But for any one man or any company of men to be appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God Authoritatively and absolutely to be Judges for others in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith and Religion, we do not find any where in Scripture or in Reason any such <hi>Commission</hi> given unto them; but we are rather admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished to take heed how we be led hoodwinkt by any, lest <hi>the blind</hi>

                        <p n="8">8. But not <hi>Scripture</hi> onely, but <hi>Reason</hi> it self does plainly commissionate <hi>private Spirits,</hi> as they call them, to judge for themselves. For these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders to <hi>Infallibility</hi> doe it onely upon the boast that they are the true suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive Church from the Apostles: But unless they will be above all mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure ridiculous, they must convince the Reason of him whom they would make a Proselyte to their Church, that their Church is that true and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical one. For to say so without proof, is a madness to be hooted at by all men: But to goe about to prove it, is to appeal to the <hi>private Reason</hi> of him they would convince. And if he be a <hi>Christian</hi> already, though not of their Church, the common acknowledged Principles are the <hi>Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> in arguing from which the Disputant appeals to him he would bring over, if his Interpretation or Allegation of them be not true. But if he be an <hi>Infidel</hi> or <hi>Pagan,</hi> he is to use <hi>Reasons</hi> to prove the Truth and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> themselves: Which is still an appeal to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of him that is to be gained to the Church, whether what is offered to him be true or false. And that which is offered to him being the whole Christian Faith, (for that is it which makes a true Church) it is plain that his <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Conscience</hi> is appealed unto, whether the whole Summe of the <hi>Credenda</hi> in Christianity is not true. That is to say, Though the Church, and he that argues in the behalf of the Church, have already judged and firmly concluded that the Christian Faith is a true Faith in the whole and in every part, and make no appeal from their own judgment in reference to themselves; yet in reference to the party they would convince, they appeal to him if the grounds of their Belief be not solid, and so imply and acknowledge that he is Judge for himself in these affairs, call that in him a <hi>private spirit</hi> or what you please.</p>

So far is it from being the Judgement of a mere <hi>private spirit.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But that rather is the Judgement of a <hi>private spirit,</hi> though it should bear the Title of an <hi>Infallible Church,</hi> which is decreed not according to the plain Texts of Scripture, so as all unprejudiced men would certainly understand them, nor according to those indeleble Characters of Truth which Christ the Eternal <hi>Logos</hi> has writ in the Rational Souls of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; but according to partial Interest and depraved desires. The sentence of Thousands, nay of Millions, of such Judges is more the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict of <hi>a private spirit,</hi> then the Judgement of the meanest <hi>private</hi> man that pronounces from such Principles as I have declared.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. Now for that odious imputation of <hi>making a mans self Superiour to the Church, by laying claim to a Judgement of discretion;</hi> I say, he lays claim to no more then is of necessity given him, as I have already demonstrated. For if there be an appeal to the <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Conscience</hi> of a <hi>private man</hi> in the endeavouring to convince him, he is <hi>ipso facto</hi> made Judge; and if to be <hi>Judge</hi> in this sense is to be <hi>Superiour,</hi> he is necessarily Superiour. But I see no necessity that his being <hi>Judge</hi> thus for himself makes him <hi>Superiour</hi> to his Church. Indeed if he judged for his Church, he were thereby their Superiour; but judging for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self onely, he usurps no Superiority over the Church; but onely is obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to him that is Superiour to both, that is, to <hi>Jesus</hi> Christ, following his plain Injunctions and Precepts, whether written in the outward Word, or legibly engraven upon the Table of his Heart. To follow therefore the plain and inevitable dictates of his own Conscience, which as the Tribunal of God, is not to exalt a mans self above the Church, but to submit a mans self to God, and exalt him above all.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. <hi>Nor does a man herein equallize himself to his Church;</hi> in that he does not define for others, but for himself, and professes himself in the mean time ready to obey the visible Church in such things as are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the express Precepts of God and Christ, and to those immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Characters of Truth which he has imprinted upon the Souls of all men, and which are there to be found, unless gross violence and Interest has obscured or obliterated them.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. <hi>Nor</hi> (in the last place) <hi>does he make himself wiser then his Church;</hi> which were also an odious imputation: But without immodesty it may be thought that a private man may be more sollicitous of his own important Concerns, and more faithfull to his own Eternal Interest, then many thousand men put together; and that therefore though he may not have so much wit and learning as these, yet he may conduct his own affairs more safely then if they were put into their hands; especially they that pretend to be guides to Heaven for others, seeming to be wholy taken up with the things of this World, as if they had forgot their intended journey.
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:42932:59"/>
It is not therefore a boast of <hi>Wisedom above the Church,</hi> but a carefull sollicitude touching such things as the wise men of the World do not usually trouble themselves much about, that may embolden some private sincere-hearted Christian to dissent from some Dictates of the Church; professing himself in other things as weak and childish as they please; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring that Doxologie of our Blessed Saviour, <hi>I thank thee, O Father,</hi>

                        <p n="14">14. But I have been more copious then was needfull or intended in confuting this dream of <hi>Infallibility.</hi> We might have made shorter work of it, and suddenly evinced the folly of that pretence, by actual Errours that have been in the Church of God. As surely <hi>the Church of the Jews</hi> was as really the Church of God as the visible <hi>Christian Church,</hi> and has as magnificent promises as it, in <hi>Isaiah.</hi> For what is spoke Chap. 54. rebounds upon the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> first, as <hi>Grotius</hi> has observed; and there it is said, That <hi>they shall all be taught of God,</hi> and that <hi>with everlasting kindness God will have mercy upon them:</hi> And yet this Church was in so gross a mistake, that the Governours and Grandees thereof knew not their <hi>Messiah</hi> when he was come into the world, but put him to a most shamefull death.</p>
                        <p>But even in those times when there was a more palpable Residence of God's miraculous power with them, they erred very hainously; as in the worshipping the Golden Calf in the wilderness, as also in the ten Tribes worshipping those in <hi>Bethel,</hi> nay apostatizing all to the worshipping of <hi>Baalim,</hi> saving seven Thousand, which were so few in respect of the rest, that <hi>Elijah</hi> took himself to be left alone.

                        <p n="15">15. And the <hi>Christian Church</hi> has no greater assurance, but if Avarice, Pride and Sensuality seize upon the Guides thereof, she may also fall into as great errours and blindnesses. The Apostle saith, <hi>Let him that stands, take heed lest he fall.</hi> And it might have been a sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 12.</note> warning to the Church of Christ betimes, which was not onely tottering, but almost universally lapsed into that over-spreading Heresy of <hi>Arrianism,</hi> to reflect upon herself, that while she does stand, she stands upon her good behaviour; and that she is not so Infallibly wise, but that she may be surprised with Errour, and over-run therewith, unless true and unfeigned Holiness clear her eyes, and keep her from being benighted in such mists of darkness.</p>
                        <p>And truly if she was above twelve hundred years agoe so obnoxious to Errour, it is high time for her to awake and consider if after so many Ages of ease and wealth and honour and affluency of all things, she has not grown fat and kicked, and cast the Commandments of God behind her back, and brought in a mere carnal Law of her own devising, more sutable to the will of the flesh and to the carrying on of her own worldly Interest. But it is sufficient in this place to have demonstrated <hi>She may erre; in what she has erred</hi> to define, is beyond the scope of my present discourse.</p>
                        <p n="16">16. We have fully defeated that Figment of pretended <hi>Infallibility,</hi> whose downfall our opposers have no colour to bewail, unless in the behalf of the common people, who are illiterate; as if they would hereby be made uncapable of any certainty of Belief, and consequently of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by reason they have no Infallible grounds to build on, this of the Church being taken away.</p>
                        <p>But they may remember that we have already acknowledged sufficient
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:42932:60"/>
certainty in that which the <hi>Universal Church</hi> agrees in, and has agreed in in all Ages, and that is <hi>the Scripture.</hi> Such an <hi>Universal Tradition</hi> as the <hi>Scripture</hi> has is acknowledged a firm Foundation; which the Church may be unfailing conveiers of down to posterity without being <hi>infallible Interpreters</hi> thereof. The unfailingness of which conveiance notwithstanding, I must confess, may be a more intricate business then what every Vulgar man can make out to himself; though infinitely less hard then to prove That the <hi>Church</hi> that would appropriate him to their Community, is <hi>Infallible.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Nay, I must confess, I do not know how it were possible that a Church should so much as prove it self a Church, much less an <hi>Infallible</hi> Church, without the Scripture. And therefore the belief of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture seems to be the most immediate of all, as <note n="*" place="margin">Cael. Secund. Curio <hi>against</hi> Floribellus.</note> he says well; <hi>Nam qui de fide &amp; authoritate Divinarum Scripturarum dubitat, quomodo, quaeso, credet Ecclesiae, quae nullam habet sine eadem Scriptura authoritatem?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="17">17. And therefore I cannot explode that by any means which is so superciliously derided by some, namely, <hi>That it is the Spirit of God that does assure us of the Truth of Scriptures more then any thing else what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.</hi> For our Saviour Christ saith, <hi>None cometh to me but whom my</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">John 6. &amp; ch. 10.</note> 
                           <hi>Father draweth. My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.</hi> Wherefore there is a <hi>discerning Spirit</hi> in those that appertain to Salvation, whether it be the Voice of God and Christ or no. For the true <hi>Shepherd goeth before, and the sheep follow him, because they know</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">John 10. 4, 5.</note> 
                           <hi>his voice; but they follow not a stranger, but flie from him, because they know not his voice;</hi> as our Saviour discourses most excellently. I say therefore, the <hi>Voice,</hi> the <hi>Call,</hi> or <hi>Whistle</hi> (if you will) of the true Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd are the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> which by an immediate sense they are as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured to be the <hi>Call</hi> of the Shepherd, and are at this day to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the election of God, as the Voice of Christ and his Apostles when they were upon Earth, the power of whose speech assisted by the Spirit did lead men captive into that Faith that worketh Salvation.</p>
                        <p>And without all question the same Word of Salvation still, which is in those Holy Records, seriously and zealously urged by men of a sincere faith and upright belief, without any mingling of it with humane devices, will have the same effect upon the multitude; and as many as are fitted will be wone to an unshaken belief of the Truth of Christianity, as it is exhibited to us in the Holy Scriptures. For they of themselves have the light and life and very breath of Christ and his Apostles wrapt up in them, to the exciting the vulgar sort to a firm and lively Faith, though many subtil Sophisters of the Kingdom of darkness might by crafty and perverse Reasoning intangle them and non-plus them in outward discourse. And therefore they are kept safe in the belief of the Scripture by the power of that Spirit in them, in virtue whereof there is that indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soluble harmonie and concord betwixt their spirits and the Scripture, though they cannot defend themselves by humane Literature, nor by the acuteness of Reason and depths of Philosophy.</p>

                           <note place="margin">Lib. 6.</note> upon that Text of S. <hi>Paul.</hi> And truely I think the Gloss is marvellous solid; namely, That the chiefest and greatest Gift of the Spirit is that Divine <hi>Wisedom,</hi> whereby a man is in a great measure able to comprehend the reasons and more deep Philosophical grounds of the Truth of the Christian Mystery: The next is <hi>Knowledge,</hi> suppose of Antiquity, History, the comparing of Prophecies, and helps of the exteriour hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane literature, the liberal Arts and Languages: The third is <hi>Faith,</hi> which is also comprised in the other, but is a Gift which is as well general as more necessary, whose nature is such as I have described already; namely, <hi>An immediate adherence to the word of Truth comprised in the Scripture, through the power of that Spirit that resides in sincere and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning Souls, that have a savoury and sensible fear of God, and are ready to goe where he calls them.</hi> For these by an ineffable Sympathy of their hearts with the veracity of the voice of Christ sounding in the Scriptures will be sure to follow their true Shepherd's call, though they turn off from the voice of the stranger and Hireling, who comes not into the Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold but to rob and kill and steal.</p>
                        <p>Whence we further see, that this pretended <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the Church in reference to the Scripture is as well <hi>useless</hi> as <hi>false,</hi> and much as if the Moon should take upon her to witness for the Sun that he sends out light; which every one that is not blind will necessarily see, though the Moon were under the Horizon. So the holy children of God, chosen and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, will feel and tast, clearly see and discern that the Scripture is the Truth of God by that light which is in it, that correspondeth with that Spirit derived from the Father of lights which he has shed into their hearts: Which, as I said, is the <hi>Spirit of Faith,</hi> and the sure portion of every Member of Christ, whether they can make out things by <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> and <hi>deep Reason</hi> or no. And if they be assaulted by Cavillers, it is their prudence to send such to their fellow-members to whom God has given also the <hi>Spirit of Knowledge</hi> or of <hi>Wisedome:</hi> or it may be more prudent to let them goe as they came, they being not worthy to give any the trouble of discourse, who put questions not with design of being seriously edified and instructed in the Truth, but for captiousness, conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and a conceited hope of puzzling him by whom they make show as if they desired to be informed.</p>
                        <p n="19">19. The <hi>fraudulent End</hi> that this pseudo-Christian Church might drive at in this peremptory boast of <hi>Infallibility</hi> is very conspicuous, as also the <hi>Mischievous events</hi> thereof. For what could this tend to but the making this Antichristian power absolute, that they might, without any ones whinching, decree and declare what-ever would tend to the encrease of their own honour and wealth, seem it never so contrary to common Reason, to the express Word of God and the Precepts of Christ? For the sentence is Infallible, let it look never so strangely and repugnantly to any Rule that we might think right.</p>

Wherefore this Power might even doe what it pleases, change Times and Laws, even the Law of God it self, and fling the house of God out at windows, as the proverb is. For who has any thing to say against that power which he is already persuaded is <hi>Infallible?</hi> And to speak sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily, and then which nothing greater can be said, The Admittance of this <hi>Infallibility</hi> is the Exclusion of Christ from his Kingdom and Throne, and the setting up a mere Mortal, a masterless Man of sin, or a pack of sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> to sway his Sceptre for him in the world.

That their rigid Impositions are against the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Christ; as also the reading of Legends instead of his Law, in Churches. 6. The dispensing also with the Divine Laws: The Fraud and Mischief thereof. 7. The Treasonable pretence of this Power's being absolute by right of succession in Christ's seat. 8. The evil effect of this pretence discoverable in several Institutes contrary to the written Laws of Christ: 9. As also in nulling those Laws he has given, as he is the Eternal Word. 10. The bloudy opposing the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty and Kingdom of Christ in murthering his faithfull Subjects.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p n="1">1. BUT there are other ways also of lifting the Government from off Christ's shoulders. As first, Suppose <hi>They should keep the Law of God in an unknown Tongue,</hi> and not let any one reade it in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage they understood: nay be so carefull that the very <hi>Prayers</hi> that are used in publick, and the celebration of the holy Eucharist, should be <hi>unintelligible,</hi> lest the power of some passages of Scripture that may occurre in the publick Service should unhindge men from the blind obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence they are held in under this Antichristian Usurpation.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. To which you may adde, what indeed might better have preceded, <hi>a Revilement of the Law of Christ,</hi> as <hi>a Book full of nothing but dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous obscurities, a</hi> Lesbian <hi>or Leaden Rule to be bended any way, a Nose of wax, a dead letter, a</hi> Farrago <hi>of casuall or occasionall Writings,</hi> which were penned not by any Divine appointment, but onely as fortuitous Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences moved the Prophets or Apostles to write them: And where they would speak most modestly, to say it is an <hi>insufficient Law or Rule,</hi> and therefore must be made up by Institutes of their own invention, or what they will please to obtrude upon the world for <hi>Traditional</hi> doctrines
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:42932:61"/>
and usages. I say, thus to <hi>Revile the Law of Christ</hi> is to null it, and thereby to null his Sovereignty over his Church, and to betray it into the hands of a stranger, to deal with them as he pleases, and to change Times and Laws and Customes in such sort, that there may be nothing sound left in Christianity, that may any way thwart the Interest of these Usurpers.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. In brief therefore thus it may be, They may pretend the Scripture obscure all over, because it is so in some places. But we have already sufficiently urged that there is enough clear of it to enlighten the single<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted in the way of eternal Salvation. But upon the pretence of the uncertain sense of some passages, they may remove all away; that those passages that would plainly discover and reprove their false doctrines and practices might not come into the sight of the people. For (as a Father has well noted) <hi>Verbum Dei est Lucerna, ad quam fur deprehenditur;</hi> and our Saviour Christ of old, <hi>They hate the light, because their deeds are evil.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But that Imputation <hi>of the Scripture's being writ occasionally,</hi> it is as weak as impious and blasphemous. As if the Spirit of God would not assist the Apostles most when occasion called for it; or as if he were to study how to inspire them and illuminate them, and could not doe it <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempore,</hi> or upon emergent occasions, but would be taken unprovided. These things savour of gross carnality and ignorance of the very nature of God and his holy Spirit, which Christ promised should not fail to be with them for ever, for the right settling of the affairs of the Church; that is to say, that it would not desert them so long as they lived, and acted in the Ministery and service thereof: Which therefore must make the Scripture very precious and of inestimable value to all sincere Believers.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore any one Paragraph of the Epistles of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> to whom Christ appeared, and called to from Heaven, and commissioned to be an Apostle, to lay the Foundation and first structure of his Church, ought to be preferred before many thousands of pretended Infallible Councils, who could never shew any such extraordinary Commission to prove themselves <hi>Infallible.</hi> For God by that miraculous appearing to <hi>Paul</hi> from Heaven, and so appointing him to be an Apostle, did proclaim to all the World that he would Infallibly assist him; and that therefore what was imparted to the World by him should be a Law irreversible to Christendom. Whence the nulling of the Authority of S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings were the abrogating of the very Law of Christ, which were a most rebellious and blasphemous Enterprise against the Sovereignty of Christ himself.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. But there is also another way of undermining or subverting the Rule and Sovereignty of the Son of God, and that is, <hi>An undervaluing his Laws in proportion of Penalties laid upon the transgression of them and of some slighter humane Ecclesiastick Institutes.</hi> As surely these would be very Antichristian Instances of this kind, namely, If Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution for him that kills his Father, or lies with his Mother, should be five or six times Cheaper then of him that takes two Orders in one day, or is
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:42932:62"/>
Ordained without Letters dismissory: or that to be Ordained out of the set times of the year should have a penalty ten times greater then Lying with a mans own Mother, or, if you will, but equal to the deflouring of a Virgin, the lying with a mans own Sister, Murther, Perjury, Sacrilege, Simonie, revealing Confession, keeping a Concubine, lying with a woman in the Church; but equal, I say, to all these nine put together. What could vilifie the indispensable Law of God and Christ more, then to make so many transgressions, and so hainous, less then that trifle of humane Tradition, <hi>To Ordain onely at such times of the year?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">5. Again, That were likewise a very conspicuous <hi>vilification of the Word of God,</hi> if instead thereof there were read in the Churches finely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devised <hi>Fables</hi> to entertain the People withall. As if they were wiser then the Wisdom of God himself, and could entertain the people more edifyingly with incredible and ridiculous stories, then with the Discourses of Christ <hi>Jesus,</hi> and sober and easily-intelligible histories of truth, that Divine Providence has recorded for the instruction of his Church.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. <hi>Dispensations</hi> also <hi>against the Law of Christ,</hi> whether written in the Word of God, or comprised in the sacred Law of Nature, which is but the Transcript of that Law in the Eternal <hi>Logos,</hi> Christ according to his Divinity, were also an Antichristian defeating of Christ's Rule and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty: as also would be the Interpretation of the serious Injunctions of Christ as if they were not <hi>Praecepta,</hi> but <hi>Consilia,</hi> not <hi>Commands,</hi> but <hi>Advice</hi> left to us to follow if we would, or to let alone if we pleased; whenas Christ plainly declares, that <hi>he that breaks the least of these</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Matt. 5.</note> 
                           <hi>Commandments, and teaches men so to doe, shall be called the least in the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> What then would it be to dispense with <hi>Perjury, Treason, Murther, Incest, Adultery, Sodomie</hi> and other such hainous crimes? What were it but the utter taking away the Law of Christ, and destroying his Kingdom upon Earth?</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Fraud</hi> and <hi>Self-endedness</hi> of which easy Anarchy is onely to fill the net full, though it be of rotten sticks and durt, so long as out of this durt they can extract Silver. But the <hi>Mischief</hi> is, that the Riches of this false Church would flow and rise with the height of the Abominations and Transgressions of rich sinners, till a deluge of wrath wash away this deluge of sin. But those in the interim that are so foolish to believe these <hi>Dispensations,</hi> and think they are come into a fair liberty of spirit, having found so facil ghostly Fathers, will thereby most certainly become the Bond-slaves of sin, which in the conclusion will as certainly deliver them up to Eternal Death.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. But what plea or pretence, will you say, may there be made of acting Religiously, while they act thus enormously, in letting the raines loose to all manner of wickedness to them that will goe to the price there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? Why yes. This Antichristian Power might pretend that all that Power which is in Christ (though it be plainly a casting Christ out of his Royall Throne) is derived upon him or them as his Successours. But Christ being the absolutely-Supreme Power may doe as he will, dispense with his own Laws as he pleases: Wherefore this Antichristian power, pretending to be or have the very same power, may dispense with the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:42932:62"/>
Laws of Christ as it pleases, especially for the enriching the Church; for all such Interest is pious. Which yet is such an Imagination, that nothing can be more Treasonable against the <hi>Regal Office</hi> of Christ, nor more destructive of his Kingdom.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. The effect of which villanous Principle would also certainly appear in this Synagogue of Satan or Antichrist, and we should find Laws and Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes quite contrary to the Laws and Decrees of the Son of God. As cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly such as these would be; namely, Sundry sorts of Idolatry, such as I have instanced in already, and need not repeat, and have noted the Frauds <note place="margin">Book I. ch. 12.</note> and fetches in the practice of them; <hi>The teaching for Doctrines the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of men,</hi> which is expresly against our Saviour's own command, and of which I have given sundry examples in my <note n="*" place="margin">Book I. ch. 17: 18, 19, 20, 21, 22.</note> second branch of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristianism; <hi>The with-holding the Cup from the Laiety,</hi> notwithstanding the Institution of the Lord's Supper by Christ himself does so plainly injoyn the communicating both of Bread and Wine, <hi>Drink you all of this;</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> again, following the Example of Christ, <hi>Let a man examine himself,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Matt. 26. 27.</note> 
                           <hi>and so eat of this bread, and drink of this cup:</hi> which indefinite command <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 28.</note> surely includes all. But <hi>the drinking of the Cup</hi> being made the Privilege of the Priest, it magnifies his condition hugely, and makes the poor Laiety feel and acknowledge their distance, how unholy and how removed from God they are in comparison of the Priesthood. This would be the true Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, though they might pretend (for I think they have nothing better to pretend) the length of the Lay-mens beards; which I suppose they would rather cut off, then be cut short in their share of so holy a Sacrament.</p>
                        <p>Again, <hi>The serving of God in the Church in an unknown Language, praying to him,</hi> and <hi>praising him,</hi> and <hi>reading the Scripture in a Tongue the people understand not,</hi> is evidently against the directions of S. <hi>Paul</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.</note> in this particular, and against that more universal and indispensable Law, <hi>Let all things be done to edifying.</hi> As also <hi>the worshipping of Angels,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 26. Coloss. 2. 18.</note> which the same Apostle does expressely speak against; and likewise the <hi>forbidding to marry, and the abstaining from meats</hi> upon a Religious <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4 3.</note> account, with several other such. All which being expressely against the Commands or Laws of Christ, it were a most reproachfull and Traitorous affront to him, the true Head of the Church, and a plain declaring against the Right of his Sovereignty, thus to make any Laws or Institutes so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to those himself has established.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. As were also <hi>the nulling at any time what-ever binds according to the Universally-known Laws of God and Nature:</hi> For these are the Laws of Christ, as he is the Eternal <hi>Logos.</hi> And therefore where any are bound by solemn Oath in publick Contracts or Covenants lawfully taken, or are legitimately married, and have committed no offence that might void the bonds of Wedlock; to pretend to have a power to dispense with or to null these Contracts and Oaths, or to legitimate such Marriages as are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Laws of God and Nature, This also would certainly be a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest affronting the Sovereignty of Christ, and the Power thus practising would discover it self plainly Antichristian.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. And lastly, to fill up the measure of this abhorred Limb of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ which we are depainting; If this pretended Infallible Power should
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:42932:63"/>
commit cruel slaughters and massacres upon the true Subjects of Christ, such as are innocent and guiltless of any wrong against any man according to the Law of God and Nature, but are (as I said) really the true subjects of Christ; were not this practice palpably Antichristian? Which sentence against them would be very hard, if it should run but thus, <hi>Let them be put to death without mercy, though they be the true Subjects of Christ Jesus.</hi>

                        <p>How Devillishly Antichristian then must that Act be that condemns them to death for that very thing that makes them <hi>the true Subjects of Jesus Christ,</hi> that is to say, because they faithfully adhere to the indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable Laws of their Lord and Master? And in what a state of manifest Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stility against Christ's true and faithful Subjects must this Power be, that so professes and practises, that if they could find out any of them, and that if it lay in their power to destroy them, they would root them from off the face of the earth, or attempt to subdue them by all imaginable penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and cruelties, by imprisonments, tortures, fire and faggot, and what not? And all this (which makes the crime infinitely more execrable) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a pretence of doing <hi>service to Christ Jesus,</hi> whose dearest and sincerest Members they thus barbarously persecute and destroy.</p>

BUT we will further consider this <hi>Antichristian</hi> Opposition in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to Christ's <hi>Prophetical Office.</hi> Where we shall dispatch very briefly, several of those practices against the <hi>Kingly Office</hi> of Christ equally reflecting upon his <hi>Prophetical.</hi> As first, The pretending the holy Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of God are so obscure that the people can make nothing of them, and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:42932:63"/>
then upon that pretence violently with-holding them from them, upon pain of death not to meddle with them against the mind of the Church: This would make Christ a Prophet without Predictions or Instructions, as I have noted above; which therefore would be a grand injury to him, as he is that great Prophet of God sent into the world. The prohibiting also the Reading of such Expositions of Scriptures as are writ by plain and sincere followers of Christ, who have interpreted with skill and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness the more useful places of Holy Writ: <hi>This</hi> also would be an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian resistence of him in his <hi>Prophetick</hi> Office; but <hi>that</hi> the utter stifling of the <hi>Spirit of Prophecy</hi> in his true Members, if they could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade them that there is already an <hi>Infallible</hi> Prophet and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Interpreter, whose sole meaning is the true sense of the Scripture, and that Scripture it self is nothing without it, and that none has either Authority or Capacity to interpret but he.</p>
                        <p>What an egregious <hi>Pseudo-prophet</hi> then, think you, would this be, who takes upon him to speak nothing but Oracles and Infallible truth, while he speaks and defines and acts such things as I have hitherto de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, <hi>Multifarious Idolatries, Insupportable Superstitions,</hi> and <hi>most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent Annulments of the plain and express Laws and Doctrines of Christ?</hi> Who therefore ever can, if this great Pseudo-prophet do not, prove the famed Antichrist indeed, that monopolizes the Right of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesying to himself alone, that he may the better deceive the whole world; and will be <hi>Infallible,</hi> that is to say, <hi>unfailingly inspired,</hi> that this extravagant boast may the more palpably discover him to be that emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent <hi>False-prophet</hi> that Christendom has so long expected and feared?</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Such a pretended Monopoly of the <hi>power of Prophesying</hi> as this is diametrically opposite to that liberty of the Spirit of Prophecy which is the Gift of Christ the Eternal Wisedom of God, which is excluded no where but out of a wicked and polluted heart, out of every Soul that is subject unto sin: otherwise that Spirit is so described in the <hi>Book of Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> that it is not in the power of any Potentate to confine it to himself.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>For it is a lover of that which is good, quick, which cannot be letted or</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Chap. 7. v. 22, &amp;c.</note>

For Wisedom is more moving then any motion; she passeth and goes through all things by reason of her pureness. For she is the breath of the power of God, and a pure influence flowing from the glory of the Almighty: therefore can no defiled thing touch her. For she is the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the everlasting light, the unspotted mirrour of the power of God, and the Image of his goodness: And being but one she can doe all things, and remaining in her self she maketh all things new; and in all Ages entring into holy Souls she makes them friends of God and Prophets.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>What one man therefore or company of men can pretend that the <hi>Gift of Prophesying</hi> is entailed on them onely, unless they were the onely pure and undefiled? Or rather what ground or assurance have they that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves can prophesy aright, they living in sin, in luxury and in all worldly impurities?</p>
                        <p n="3">3. It is nobly concluded of <hi>Caelius Secundus Curio</hi> against <hi>Floribellus:</hi>

                           <hi>Neque enim vera Dei cognitio, verúsque cultus, unius aut Familiae, aut Gentis, aut Sectae propria esse potest; sed quicunque sensu immortalitatis tanguntur, ii ad se eandem pertinere existimare debent.

                        <p>And immediately after speaking more particularly of Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion as it is revealed in the Scripture, <hi>Ac nè illud quidem verè dici potest, quod quidam putant, summam Religionis quasi Haereditariam ad unum aliquem venisse, sic ut pro libidine sua interpretari, addere, demere, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare, statuere, abrogare aliquid in ea possit.

                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. Wherefore as concerning those Eternal and Immutable Rules of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Reason which God has engraven upon every mans Spirit, and come in as freely as the Light of the Sun into their natural eyes, and without which what-ever Prophecies there are or Instructions in the Holy Writ, it were impossible for us to be ascertained of the Truth of them, or indeed of any meaning in them; I say, upon pretence of an imperious Infallibility to deface these Divine Characters of the Soul, or to command them silence, or to give them the Lie, would be an act of the most notorious <hi>False-prophet,</hi> and most contradictious to the <hi>Prophetick Office</hi> of Christ, (whether you respect his Humanity or Divinity) that can ever manifest himself in the world.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. As for example, If this impudent Oracle should declare, <q>That one and the same individual Body can be in several places at one and the same moment of time, yea in infinite places, in a manner, and at vast distances, at once; That that may be made or created which is already in being; That the real and sensible mode of a Subject may subsist separate from that Subject, as, suppose, Motion or Hardness, where there is nothing moved or hard; That what we have assurance of by all our Senses and by the Senses of all men constantly, the Object being at a due di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and the <hi>Medium</hi> fitted, and the Organs rightly disposed, may notwithstanding all this be false; That the same Body at the same time may be bigger and lesser then it self; but an inch distant from me, and a thousand miles distant from me, at once; That one and the same person may be many thousand miles absent from himself, and that he may both sit still and make a journey to himself at the same time; That an entire organized Body may be wholly in every part thereof, all of it in the Eye, and consequently every part in every part, the comely parts in those on which Nature has bestowed less comeliness; That an entire Body may be divided, and yet not into two parts (suppose) but into two wholes, and both the same with the divided Entire body; That the same Body may be now at <hi>Athens,</hi> and after at <hi>Thebes,</hi> and yet not pass

any <hi>medium</hi> direct or circuitous to come thither; That a man may swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low every atom of his own body at once into his belly, limbs, back, belly, head, and mouth and all; That one and the same individual person may be of different ages at once, above thirty years old, and yet not above three hours old at the same time; That Religious Worship, even that which is <hi>Latria,</hi> may be given to Images, and yet without Idolatry; That Christ may satisfie for the faults of men, and yet they remain ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to the penalties due for those faults; with several others of that kind:</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>I say, whosoever, upon pretence of being <hi>Prophet-general</hi> to the world, should lift up his head on high and utter such Infallible Contradictions as these in the name of the Lord of Hosts, or such oracular Definitions as must be false unless these be true, we need not spend time in asking him, <hi>Art thou he, or do we look for another?</hi> but may assuredly conclude that he is that expected eminent <hi>False-prophet</hi> who does Antichristianly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose himself against the Spirit of Truth which Christ has imparted to the world, partly by writing those immutable and infallible Rules of common Reason in the Souls of men; and partly by those Holy Writings which he has left to his Church, recorded by inspired men and Prophets; and lastly, by a special converse with more holy and sanctified Souls, to whom he does in a more certain and assured way then ordinary impart his Spirit of Illumination, as appears out of what we have cited out of the <hi>Book of Wisedom,</hi> and might be proved out of sundry other places of the Canonical Scripture.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. And now whereas such a <hi>False-prophet</hi> as this has nothing to defend himself from the suspicion of being an Impostor, but the peremptory and impudent bearing men down that he is <hi>Infallible,</hi> it is but seasonable to appeal here to the world, Whether it be not infinitely more likely that this one man, or company of men, or succession of either, doing no real Miracles to extort belief, nor living better nor so well as other men, should be <hi>fallible</hi> and <hi>subject to error,</hi> or <hi>given to deceit,</hi> then that the above-cited absurd Conclusions should be true.

The thing that I contend for is this; That that Polity that usurps this Authority to themselves, and does all these indignities, injuries and cruelties, and uses all these unlawful means which I have noted, for the stifling of the Spirit of Truth, insomuch that Christ neither in his own person, nor in those Holy Records he has recommended to the world, nor in his living Instruments which he extraordinarily directs and assists, is permitted to admonish and inform men what is the right way, and what those indispensable duties to be done; that that Polity, I say, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haves it self thus, does therein notoriously <hi>Antichristianize,</hi> that is, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose Christ in his <hi>Prophetick Office</hi> as much as any Antichrist can doe; and that the being thus minded and acting after this manner is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted and conspicuous piece of the crassest <hi>Antichristianism.</hi>

                        </argument>
                        <p n="1">1. LEt us now decypher what Antichristian opposition may be made against the <hi>Sacerdotal Office</hi> of Christ. There is one main and signal Privilege of the <hi>Priesthood</hi> of Christ, which is apparently and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly set down by the Author to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and look'd upon as a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Dignity and Perfection thereof, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9. <hi>Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the High-priest entreth into the holy place every year with the bloud of others: For then must he often have suffered since the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world; but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself. And as it is appointed for men once to die, but after this the judgment: So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many,</hi> &amp;c. And again, chap. 10. <hi>And every Priest standeth daily ministring and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins: But this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever,</hi> (which a little before he calls <hi>the offering of his Body once</hi>
                           <pb n="111" facs="tcp:42932:65"/>
                           <hi>for all) sat down at the right hand of God,</hi> &amp;c. Which words do plainly declare, That the Excellency of that true Offering of that Eternal High-priest, when he offered up his Body to his Father to reconcile the World unto God, is such, as that it needs no repetition; Salvation being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in that one act of Christ as to the matter of Propitiation for sins.</p>
                        <p>Whence it would follow, That the pretending that Christ is <hi>really and actually offered up</hi> as a Propitiatory Sacrifice for the quick and the dead by the hands of the Priest in the celebration of the Eucharist, were a foul derogation to the <hi>Perfectness</hi> of that one Oblation of our Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent High-priest Christ <hi>Jesus,</hi> when he offered himself up to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for an Atonement for the sins of the whole World. I say, this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous conceit of <hi>offering him up really and bodily</hi> in every celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lord's Supper, were an hainous Antichristian affront against the <hi>Sacerdotal</hi> Excellency of Christ:</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Which Figment is still the more vile, if we consider with what course abuses of the Person of Christ, and with what villainous and barbarous injuries it must necessarily be conceived to be accompanied: How often by the mere power of that <hi>Quinque-verbal</hi> charm we above mentioned, he must be forced to fall into the hands of sinners, though uttered with no devotion toward him at all; for else the whole company might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to commit the grossest Idolatry imaginable, even as gross as the most barbarous Nations ever did commit. But if he come into the Priest's hands, he is betrayed into worse usages then <hi>Jeremie</hi> that was let down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the miry Dungeon.</p>
                        <p>A mans fancy would abhor to follow whither they send that which they say is the King of Glory, the living and real Body or Person of Christ. Which horrid and nasty servitude he is put to, not once or twice, nor in one of these stinking miry prisons at once, but in many thousands at the same time, and weekly, nay, it may be, daily, for many hundreds of years together.</p>
                        <p>What despight and mockery therefore would it be for to keep their Churches clean and adorned, to burn Incense and sweet Odours, to have all things lightsome and splendid, against the Lord whom they seek come into his Holy Temple; and yet as soon as he is come, not to permit him to have the common enjoyment of these sumptuous preparations, but, as it were in mockery and despight, (as I said) to clap him up into a dungeon more foul and miry then that of the afflicted Prophet? and when he is more gently entreated, yet to enclose him in a <hi>Pyx</hi> like a reprieved pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner, that they may afterwards let him out occasionally into the tainted mouths and bodies of expiring men? As if Christ prophesied false upon the Cross when he said, <hi>It is finished;</hi> when there was such an inexhausted Residue of loathsome drudgery behind for him to undergo.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. These things are very ugly and unworthy, which though they be not in the power of any man to doe against Christ, yet in that they profess to doe them, they acknowledge they would doe them if they could; and therefore do really vilifie him and reproach him, as they that hang up or otherwise execute an escaped Criminal <hi>in effigie,</hi> declare their mind as much as if they had really executed it upon his person.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="112" facs="tcp:42932:66"/>
But this horrid reproach against the Person of Christ is still the more aggravable, if they be so barbarously serious in imprinting it on the minds and beliefs of men, that they will lay violent hands on them that deny it, and slay them. Can a man excogitare a more industriously-managed Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy against that <hi>Holy Tabernacle</hi> of the Godhead, the Body of the Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> then this? or desire a firmer proof of their readiness to use the Body of Christ so coursely and cruelly if they could, when they do not stick to murther those that deny it to be in their power so to doe, though they had never so great a mind to doe it?</p>
                        <p n="4">4. But though they fall short of their malice or presumption here, yet they may assault the sacred Office of Christ's <hi>Priesthood</hi> with a more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and mischievous Attempt, exceeding ungrateful and reproachful, a poison that would eat out the very marrow and sweetness of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, and damp and obscure the grace and glory of the <hi>Sacerdotal</hi> Function of the Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> and frustrate and evacuate the main end of his Sufferings, which was to satisfie the wrath of God for the sins of the world, by making himself a Propitiatory Sacrifice for them; that so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as believed in Christ <hi>Jesus,</hi> according to the gentle tenour of that New Covenant which he made in his Bloud for remission of sins, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to follow his Precepts according to that light and strength which should be orderly or gradually imparted to them, might be sure of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God, being justified by Faith in the Passion and Merits of Christ, and not by any works or merits of their own.</p>
                        <p>For that this is the tenour of the New Covenant, and the true summe of that most acceptable and joyful news of the Gospel, is abundantly evident through all the Writings of the Apostles: namely, That <hi>being justified by Faith,</hi> in a <hi>Forensal</hi> sense, that is, acquitted and assoiled from the guilt of all our sins, as well as in several measures, according to our several ages and growths in Christianity, sanctified and purified from them, (which assoilment from guilt does necessarily imply security from punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) <hi>we might,</hi> as the Apostle speaks, <hi>have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> This assuredly is the very Nature and Genius of the <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 1.</note> Evangelical Dispensation, and the sweetest and the most refreshing Flower to decayed Mortals in all this Garden of God, and the peculiar endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of sincere Souls to be loyal and obedient Children and unfeigned lovers of his Son <hi>Jesus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">5. Whence it will follow, That there can be nothing more salvagely and barbarously Antichristian then to root out this comfortable Plant, this Tree of Life, out of God's Paradise, the Church. For such is the Cross of Christ, on which that holy Propitiatory Sacrifice did hang; the influence of whose Death is a cooling balsam that heals the wounds and stings of a troubled Conscience, which the more sincere, many times, the more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tressed. And therefore the Atonement of our dying Saviour considered in his Soul-melting Passion is exhibited to her as her onely and proper Cure.</p>
                        <p>Nothing therefore more despightfully can be invented against the value and use of that inestimable Bloud which our ever-to-be-adored High-priest shed upon the Cross for the securing our peace, then to misinterpret the

efficacy thereof, as if it had the virtue of onely taking away the <hi>Guilt</hi> of our sins, but that if we will be free from the <hi>Punishment,</hi> we must labour out that by our own Merits and satisfactory Penances. This is to turn the intended sweetness of the Christian Dispensation into a Stygian sour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, the joyfull and glorious Day of the Gospel into a cloudy <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Night, (wherein dwells nothing but horrour and servitude) peace of mind into perturbation, and to make the Bloud of the Son of God more vile then that of Bulls and Goats.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Wherefore it is manifest, That to teach that we are not justified by <hi>Faith,</hi> but by <hi>Works</hi> and <hi>Penances,</hi> which we must suffer as such, that is to say, as <hi>Satisfactory penances,</hi> and not by way of correction and emen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of life, such hardships as may be medicinal and curative of what-ever depravations of nature we labour under, but merely (as I said) for satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of sin committed, as if so be the Sacrifice and Satisfaction of Christ upon the Cross were not sufficient to atone the wrath of God, without every man suffer for himself also the punishments from which Christ came to free us, that with a more ingenuous love and comfortable liberty of spirit from all such bondages of the Law and slavish anxieties we might serve him in a true and living way, in real holiness and righteousness; I say, to teach such doctrine as this, would be plainly to supplant and oppose the <hi>Sacerdotal Office</hi> of Christ in that eminent act and genuine issue thereof (the Oblation of himself for the sins of the world, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king our pacification with God) then which nothing can be excogitated more Antichristian.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Which still will appear more hideous if we consider the extent that the necessity of these <hi>Penances</hi> may be conceived to have, not distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the peace onely of this life, but pursuing us also, like the Poetical Furies, with whips and torches, to plague us and torment us in the other state, as we have <note n="*" place="margin">Book 1. Ch. 22.</note> already described: As if what-ever blemish or miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of this frail life has happened could not be expiated, no not by the Bloud of the Eternal Son of God, but every man must pay his own debt in the other world to the utmost farthing. Which assuredly makes the Sufferings of Christ of none effect, and is quite against the sense of a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory</hi> Sacrifice.</p>
                        <p>Is this he of whom the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> in that melodiously-mournfull burthen so sweetly and comfortably complains, <hi>He was wounded for our Transgressions, he was bruised for our Iniquities; the Chastisement of our</hi>

                           <hi>peace was upon him, and with his stripes we are healed?</hi> No, says this ungratefull and perfidious Antichristian power, every man shall be healed with his own stripes, and bear the burthen of his own iniquity; he shall be whipt, and stript, and wear hair-cloath next his skin, take long and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious pilgrimages, creep upon his bare knees on flinty causeys, fast and watch, not for correction and emendation of life, but for satisfaction for his sins already committed, as if the Son of God had never satisfied for them.</p>
                        <p>And this he shall suffer not onely in this life, but the <hi>Fire of Purgatory,</hi> which is a temporary Hell, (and must torment men as long as they please to define) shall be kindled about him in the other world; which nothing
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:42932:67"/>
shall extinguish but the full paiment for the whole score, (for if not for all, why for any?) a plenary satisfaction made, not by Christ, but his own self, or any friend else that will doe him the favour. For he is taught to decline the Merit and Satisfaction of Christ, who was onely able to satisfie for us, and who did it unhired and unrewarded by us; and to flie to any one, may it but bring a piece of Mony in to the Church, rather then to him.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. Can there be then any thing more fundamentally and essentially An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian then thus to flight and cast away, or fraudulently for filthy lucre to suppress and conceal, the precious fruit of the Passion and Merits of so sufficient and loving a Saviour, and make men believe that they are to be saved by their own Merits, and to satisfie both here and hereafter for their own sins; whenas it is a thing both impossible and needless, and diametrically opposite to the meaning and design of the Death and Passion and complete Satisfaction made by our Blessed Saviour himself?</p>
                        <p n="9">9. This doctrine seems abominable enough of it self; but if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider upon what grounds and with what circumstances it may be foisted into the Church by that Antichristian power we are a-describing, it will be yet infinitely more hatefull and execrable. <hi>Judas</hi> betrayed Christ for a piece of mony into the hands of them that crucified him, for which his memory is accursed to all posterity: And yet Christ was betrayed but to that which he was willing to undergoe, namely, He willingly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went the wrath of God, that he might shelter us from it, which was the very end of his Agonie and Passion.</p>
                        <p>Now suppose this false Church we are depainting should for a piece of mony betray the very End and Design of Christ's Passion, and quite frustrate and evacuate it; were not Christ worse betrayed here then by <hi>Judas</hi> himself? For <hi>Judas</hi> betrayed him but to what he had a mind to, that he might be an Oblation to God for the remission of sins to all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers: But this Antichristian Church, frustrating him of the End of his Suffering, more barbarous then <hi>Judas,</hi> betray the Saviour of the World to an unwilling death, and disappoint him of that prize for which alone he parted with his dearest bloud; and are more truely the Murtherers of this Just one then the very Jews that Crucified him, robbing him of that which was the life in his death, and prized by him above his own life, that is to say, His being a sufficient Sacrifice and Atonement for the sins of the whole World.</p>
                        <p>Which holy and weighty Article of the Christian Faith that Church which barters away for gain, to scare the people into the belief of a necessity of buying Pardons and Indulgences, of hiring Priests to sing their Souls out of Purgatory, of redeeming themselves by summes of mony from cruel imposed Penances, must needs in this point Antichristianize in the highest and most hainous manner against the <hi>Sacerdotal Office</hi> of Christ that can be imagined.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. This is the wicked <hi>Fraud</hi> they commit, and the <hi>Mischief</hi> is not unproportionable. For by the persuading of men that they are justified by their own Merits, and must satisfie for themselves for all their sins and offences, either in this life or that which is to come, or both, nay indeed
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:42932:67"/>
in both, unless they die so perfect as no modest man will ever imagine himself, they put the minds of the serious upon an intolerable rack of sollicitude about the torments of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> which they affrightfully set out to be of the same nature, though not of the same continuance, with those of Hell; or swell the minds of the vain-spirited with unwholesome tumours of Pride, upon conceit of such merit as never was nor ever can be in any man living that is a mere man; and, lastly, deface the peculiar glory of Christ and his Religion, in which there does really breath nothing but sweetness and pity and tender compassion; our Head and Sovereign, the Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> sustaining those great torments both of minde and body on the Cross, to set his People free, that they might serve him in a way of Love and Ingenuity, contrary to that bloudy and cruel vassalage in which Satan aforetimes had enslaved the world.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore this false Church by the Fiction of <hi>Purgatory</hi> and the bloudy and cruel <hi>Penances</hi> imposed on the flock of Christ, by merciless Flagellations and excoriations of the flesh, more like the Priests of the Devil, that old Tyrant, then like the Ministers of the Gospel of the Son of God, would make Christendom of one hue again with ancient Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism, and sell the children of <hi>Israel</hi> into a second <hi>Aegyptian</hi> bondage to be afflicted and oppressed under those hard Task-masters: which state of things how grossely Antichristian it is, I have already abundantly noted.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. But yet there is a further opposing of Christ's <hi>Sacerdotal Office,</hi> and that very considerable, as he <hi>intercedes and meditates for us with God.</hi> Concerning which the Scripture is very express, as in the former case, <hi>That Christ was offered but once,</hi> so in this, <hi>That our Mediatour is but one. For there is one God, and one Mediatour between God and men, the Man</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 5, 6.</note> 
                           <hi>Christ Jesus, who gave himself a ransome for all, to be testified in due time.</hi> Where not onely the doctrine is asserted, <hi>That there is but one Mediatour,</hi> but the reason subjoyned, <hi>Who gave himself a ransome for all.</hi> Which being peculiar to him alone, there can be no Mediatour betwixt God and Man but he: And the merits of his Passion and all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of his life are of so infinite virtue, as being the declared Son of God, that to joyn the Merits of any Saints or Angels with his in this behalf, would be a reproachfull and blasphemous derogation to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereminency of his condition.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore the Right of Mediatourship upon point of Merit being Christ's alone, it must of necessity be an act of Antichristianism, and an injury against Christ's person, to joyn any other with him in that Office; as if he himself were not sufficient, but were so weak and unable for that Function, that he wanted coadjutors.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. As for those Allegations, <hi>That God will spare a City for fifty righteous in it;</hi> and that <hi>he would protect Jerusalem for his servant David's sake, because he did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord;</hi> and that <hi>he will be mercifull to thousands of them that love him and keep his Commandments;</hi> No reasonings from these Scriptures will reach the matter in hand. For these are all about <hi>Temporal</hi> concernments; and the Fate of the righteous would be involved in that of the wicked in the first instance. As for that of <hi>David,</hi> he is acknowledged a Type of Christ,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:42932:68"/>
but the Sun being up, the Night is fled away. Nor do I see that any thing can be inferred out of that of <hi>Exodus,</hi> but that the posterity of the just, if they continue so, shall be continued. These therefore are but pretences, and can never reach the case that I would decypher, which is this; That we should <hi>put up our Prayers</hi> to this or that Saint, intreating them that they would intercede for us, as if they had the same privilege that Christ has, who is God as well as Man, and therefore is every where ready to hear us.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. Wherefore this is to rob Christ of his honour and privilege, to presume that the Saints have a kind of <hi>Omnipresence</hi> or <hi>Omnisciency,</hi> which is onely proper to him: As also in a solemn Religious way at the Altar and in the Temple of such or such a Saint to pray to God in the Merits of these Saints to grant this or that petition, were it not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim openly that there is a deficiency in the Merits of Christ our great Mediatour, when we thus seek refuge in the names and merits of others?</p>
                        <p>How Antichristian then would it be if they should prefer some Saint, suppose the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> before <hi>Christ</hi> himself, in their addresses to her, beseeching her that she would command her Son in the virtue of that duty he owes to his Mother; if they should give unto her the Title of <hi>the Queen of Heaven, the Mother of Mercies, their Life, their Hope, the Light of the Church, their Advocate and Mediatress;</hi> nay should turn all the Psalms of <hi>David</hi> into Petitions or Praises to her, onely putting <hi>Domina</hi> instead of <hi>Dominus, Lady</hi> instead of <hi>Lord?</hi> I say, what an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian Figment would this be, to make the humble Virgin to justle thus with the Son of God for the Sovereignty of Heaven and the Mediatour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship general of the whole World? Not to mention the making of whole swarms of other Mediatours upon the account also of their own Merit. For if it be not upon account of their own <hi>Merits</hi> and sufferings, (though they could not merit nor suffer any more then would serve for themselves) why should they make them <hi>Mediatours?</hi> But if their <hi>Merits</hi> adde any thing to the <hi>Merits</hi> and <hi>Sufferings</hi> of Christ, how was he a perfect High-Priest, or his <hi>Merits</hi> perfect?</p>
                        <p>Wherefore it is manifest that to make other <hi>Meritorious</hi> Mediatours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides Christ, is an Antichristian reproach and calumnie against the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and Excellency of Christ's <hi>Mediatourship.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="14">14. But the <hi>wicked Fraud</hi> of this Invention may be the multiplying of Offerings to those new and appropriate Intercessours, who, being well bribed, will plead the cause of their Clients very zealously in the Court of Heaven; or at least this Antichristian Priesthood may make them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve so, who has sold away the <hi>onely Mediatourship</hi> of Christ as well as the virtue of his precious Death and Passion, for a piece of mony; not considering the grievous Mischiefs that may come upon the Church by multiplying of Patrons and Mediatours.</p>
                        <p>For how easily are the heedless people lulled asleep in security by thinking they have such a sure friend of this or that Saint, which they have peculiarly chosen to themselves for their Patron, whom they honour with certain superstitious Ceremonies, and think they so oblige him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that live they as they list, they will notwithstanding get safely to
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:42932:68"/>
heaven, though let in at some back-door by such a special friend there, who will be ready to receive them? Whenas our Saviour Christ has told them afore-hand, that <hi>unless a man be born again, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God;</hi> and that those whose lives are unreclaimed, he will not own, but command them to depart as workers of Iniquity.</p>
                        <p>How easily are they hereby drawn off from that faith and reliance they ought to have on God and Christ, expecting even Sanctification and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption from that which cannot save? How basely is their mind de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed to low thoughts, which ought to be lifted up to God alone? How subject to be immersed into the coursest and grossest degrees of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> whilest they without any stop conceit That the Temple, the Altar, the Priest with all his holy Vestments, the Festival and all the holy Offerings are dedicated and designed to the honour of that Saint whom they make their Patron and Advocate?</p>
                        <p n="15">15. And lastly, How will that excellent and most powerfull instrument of our Sanctification and Renovation of our Minds into the lovely Image of the Lord Christ, I mean the <hi>Cross and Passion of our onely Mediatour,</hi> and the Meditation thereon, whereby our Souls might effectually be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to follow his steps in all things, and serve him out of an unfeigned love, how will this excellent Instrument, I say, be made useless and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual, by this diverting the minds of men to some other self-chosen Patron, or by distracting them amidst the variety of so many Mediatours, (which are wholly insignificant as to any service or furtherance of real Sanctity) that that due love and loyalty which is owing onely to Christ, and which were the very saving life of our Souls, and the purification of our hearts, and requisite preparation for an eternal commerce with him in his Heavenly Kingdom, would be hugely diminished and made languid, or else quite lost? which is a dammage and <hi>Mischief</hi> plainly incomputable and irreparable. I say, The derivation of our devotion and affection from Christ into so many by-streams, and upon such Objects from which there is infinitely less obligation and urgency upon us to become good and holy, is no less then the hazzard or forfeiture of our eternal Salvation.</p>
                        <p>It is plain therefore that the opposing and supplanting the Ends and Usefulness of the <hi>Sacerdotal Office</hi> of Christ in such sort as I have declared, would be a very considerable part of that <hi>Idea of Antichristianism</hi> which I endeavour to describe.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. THus have we delineated unto you the nature of this Antichristian Opposition in these <hi>Three</hi> generally-noted <hi>Offices of Christ,</hi> which even alone considered, one would think enough to make up a complete <hi>Antichrist,</hi> that is to say, so to corrupt any Ecclesiastick power, as truely and fully to denominate it <hi>Antichristian.</hi> But yet this <hi>Antichristianism</hi> may be further displayed by more particular Oppositions to <hi>other Titles of Christ.</hi> We will not be curious to name all, nor so tedious as to insist long upon any which we shall further name, they being reducible some way or other most of them to some one of those <hi>Three Offices</hi> we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready insisted on.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The most notable of these <hi>Titles</hi> are these; <hi>The Truth, The Light,</hi> and <hi>The Life,</hi> in the New Testament; and in <hi>Esay, The mighty God,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Chap. 9.</note> 
                           <hi>The everlasting Father,</hi> and <hi>The Prince of Peace.</hi> This is the style, these are the Sacred <hi>Titles</hi> of Christ: And therefore any Power pretending to succeed him, and to have right and authority to rule for him here on Earth, so far forth as they contradict and oppose these <hi>Titles</hi> of Christ in their management of things, so far forth they do discover themselves <hi>Antichristian.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As now if this pretended Power should traffick much in <hi>lying Legends</hi> and <hi>Figments,</hi> in <hi>false Miracles</hi> and <hi>cunningly-devised Fables,</hi> which the Apostle protests against, to lead about the people with fraud and guile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, to engraft such opinions in their Minds as would most of all widen their purses, in such manner as I have had already occasion more particularly to describe; and also to darken all with a multitude of Ceremonies, which are but shadows of the Truth, if they be that: Such a constitution of things as this does plainly discover it self to be <hi>Antichristian,</hi> and to oppose that <hi>Title</hi> of Christ which styles him <hi>The Truth. Without are</hi>

                           <hi>Daniel,</hi> that <hi>Antiochus,</hi> who is generally look'd upon as a <hi>Type of Antichrist,</hi> is said <hi>to cast down the Truth to the ground.</hi>

                        <p n="3">3. The next Title is, <hi>The Light,</hi> which is a figurative Title, and signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies <hi>Wisedom</hi> and <hi>Knowledge;</hi> and indeed upon the matter is but a sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical expression of the former. For <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>true Wisedom</hi> are one and the same thing; but in that it irradiates and informs the minds of others, it is more especially called <hi>Light.</hi> And Christ is so called both in that he enlightens every man that comes into the world according to his Divine nature, and in that he was <hi>the Light of the Gentiles and the Glory of his people Israel</hi> in his exteriour Personal manifestation to the world.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore to endeavour to keep the people in a worse then <hi>Aegyptian</hi> darkness under pretence of raising their devotion to God, when the plot
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:42932:69"/>
is to have them wholy at their own devotion, and to abuse them and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead them as they please, it were plainly to Antichristianize against this Second Title of Christ, <hi>The Light,</hi> and to defeat the End of his coming into the World, which was to be a <hi>Light to lighten the Gentiles,</hi> and to <note place="margin">Isa. 42. 6.</note> bring them that sit in darkness out of the Prison-house. And Christ has entailed this Title also upon his true followers and Successours; <hi>Ye are</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Matt. 5. 14.</note> 
                           <hi>the Light of the World.</hi> What then are they that are not onely not shining Lights themselves, but industrious abettors and promoters of darkness and ignorance, and diligent hinderers of any true light that may be let into the Church from others?</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The Third Title of Christ is, <hi>The Life,</hi> as it is written in S. <hi>John</hi>'s Gospel, <hi>In him was the life, and the life was the light of men.</hi> Which <hi>life</hi> I conceive S. <hi>Paul</hi> describes very savourly, when he saith, <hi>That the Kingdom of Heaven is not meat, nor drink, but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.</hi> Christianity therefore is a dispensation of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>life</hi> flowing out into all laudable and usefull actions; not a <hi>Babel</hi> of confused and intangling Opinions and unprofitable Observances, a heap of Ceremonies and Conceits, but a steddy abode in God, who is <hi>Love,</hi> and will teach us and inable us from an inward sense of Life to love him with all our hearts and all our souls, and our Neighbour as our selves; which is the most eminent fulfilling of the whole Law.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore instead of this holy dispensation of the Spirit and Life, if there were introduced a rigid adherence to empty Opinions and unedifying Observations of multifarious Ceremonies, this would be an Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Trespass against this Third Title of Christ, while we thus substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute insipid Theories and dead Formalities in the place of the Power and Life of Godliness.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. The Fourth Title is, <hi>The mighty God;</hi> and the <hi>Divinity of Christ</hi> is an acknowledged Article of our Faith, and so choice a Prerogative of his Person, that whatsoever does derogate from this, infringe or weaken it, cannot but be deemed considerably <hi>Antichristian.</hi> Such therefore must be the building of Temples and Altars, the burning of Incense, and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Invocations and Prayers to Saints or Angels.</p>
                        <p>Nay, though there were no Prayers put up to them, the solemnly reposing the <hi>Reliques of Saints</hi> in any Church or Chappel, and making them therewith the Patrons or Tutelar <hi>Genii</hi> as it were of such a City or Province, were no less then <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and a Superstition much like that of the ancient Pagans in their <hi>Telesms</hi> and <hi>Palladiums,</hi> and their <hi>Dii Tutelares,</hi> whose presence they conceited to be detained by these supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Ceremonies, and so made them Patrons and Protectours of their Cities and Countries. Wherefore if the Christians by religiously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing the <hi>Reliques</hi> of this or that Saint in this or that City should be so superstitiously conceited as to repose a <hi>Trust</hi> in the Aide of these Saints from Pestilence, from War, from Thunder, from Earthquakes or the like, believing them powerfull and benigne Protectours of the Place; this undoubtedly were a kind of Religious worship done to them, and could not be less then the sin of <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For all such <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repose upon any particular invisible Power</hi> is
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:42932:70"/>
Idolatrous, as well as <hi>Invocation,</hi> because it as well supposes in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular invisible Power what is onely proper to God. For there is no certainty of the Presence, and consequently of the Assistence, of an invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Power in any one place, unless the nature of that Power be to be in all places at once. And therefore he that puts his <hi>Trust</hi> for Aid and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence, in such a sort as I have described, in a particular invisible Power, makes that invisible Power <hi>Omnipresent</hi> or <hi>Omniscient,</hi> which are the incommunicable Attributes of God, and thereby commits <hi>Idolatry,</hi> as I have above more fully argued in the like case.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. The mere trusting therefore in Saints as Patrons and Protectours of such and such Places, as well as the building of Altars, burning of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense to them, or invoking them, derogates from the onely-assured Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage and powerfull Divinity of our Blessed Saviour. For by these Divine honours we equallizing such Patrons or Mediatours as these to the onely-begotten Son of God, make him less then he is, and but like them; that is to say, make him unlike himself, obscure the peculiarity of his Divinity, and disclaim his Godhead; <gap reason="foreign">

For there is onely one that is capable of this Divine honour, which therefore if we give to any other, we act the part of that <hi>Antichrist</hi> who is defined by <hi>the denying the Father and the Son:</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">1 John 2 22.</note> For the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son</hi> are one.</p>
                        <p>Such an arguing as this God seems to implie in his expostulation with the <hi>Israelites</hi> in the wilderness; <hi>O ye house of Israel, have ye offered to me Victimes and Sacrifices by the space of forty years in the Wilderness? Yea ye</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Acts 7.</note> 
                           <hi>took up the Tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your God Remphan,</hi> &amp;c. The sense of which assuredly is this; That though the <hi>Israelites</hi> did sacrifice, as they thought, or did pretend, their usual sacrifices to God, according to the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> during their abode in the wilderness; yet because they served and acknowledged other Gods besides him, he infers (and that truly and justly, even according to the humane Faculties) that they really did not serve him at all, that is, did not acknowledge him to be what he was, the onely true God. And therefore they erring in the apprehension of the Excellency of that Object to which Divine worship is due, as if it were so mean that there could be many such, did not direct their worship to him, but to a phancy or Idol of their own making, to which they profanely attributed the name of <hi>Jehovah.</hi> For the true <hi>Jehovah</hi> was not so vile a Being as there could be any partakers of Divine honour with himself.</p>
                        <p>And so it is with Christ, who is the same true God blessed for ever. He that gives <hi>Divine honour,</hi> which is due to him alone, unto Saints or Angels, disclaims his <hi>Divinity,</hi> and makes him but as one of them. This would be one Antichristian way of undermining his Godhead, by equalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing mere Creatures unto him.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. But there is another way, or rather the same way but in an higher degree, and consequently more Antichristian; and that is, the preferring that which is but a mere Creature, though a blessed and glorious one, before him or above him. As for example, if either Fraud or blind Devotion should exalt the ever-blessed Virgin, not onely to that Divine honour
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:42932:70"/>
of having Temples and Altars erected to her with Prayers and Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of her, as in the worship of the rest of the Saints and Angels, but that these Honours should be done much more frequently and more magnificently to the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> then to <hi>Christ</hi> himself; that is to say, that there should be more Temples and Altars, and more sumptuous, erected to her then to Christ <hi>Jesus,</hi> more Devotions, Prayers and Offerings made to her then to him, a greater acknowledgement of mercy and goodness from her, then from him who poured out his Life in the bitter Agonies of his bloudy Passion for the Salvation of the World; and, lastly, be ascribed unto her a Superiority and Authority over Christ, to command him to doe this or that by virtue of that duty he owes unto her.</p>
                        <p>Certainly if this be not against the <hi>Divinity</hi> of Christ, nothing can be, thus to make him inferiour to a deceased woman, even him that is perfect God as well as perfect Man. For it is plainly to <hi>un-deify</hi> him, if I may so speak, and to declare him to be no God at all. Which is as <hi>Antichristian</hi> an outrage against the <hi>Divinity</hi> of Christ as can be imagined.</p>
                        <p>For who is <hi>Antichrist</hi> if he be not that denies the Father, and the Son <note place="margin">1 John 2. 22.</note> who is one and equal with the Father? And who denies the Godhead of both Father and Son, but he that pronounces the Mother of Christ according to the flesh to be greater then them both, as certainly she is if she be greater then either?</p>

                        <p>Also if they should make it their business to define the sense of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by a more determinate meaning then there were use of in the Church, and put their Determinations and Expositions upon men as necessary points of belief; This would also make much against the <hi>Peaceableness</hi> of the Church, men being in a manner fatally propending to think this or that way in things that are not necessary to Salvation, to be determined either. There would needless violence therefore be done to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences of men, thereby to set the world on fire.

As if their living exemplarily, and urging the performance of what is plain in Scripture, and keeping an orderly Discipline in those things, would not gain them more respect, and make them more honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able both in the eyes of God and man: or as if they would not appear more <hi>infallible</hi> by insisting in his steps who is <hi>the Way, the Truth, and the Life,</hi> then by grossely crossing this way, or going out of it for some by-advantages of the World: The discovery of which <hi>Frauds</hi> must needs make them odious to all men.

                        <p>Those Oppositions also that were against the <hi>Offices</hi> of Christ; the vilifying his Law, the removing it from the eyes of the people, or the reading of it and their publick Service in an unknown Tongue; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting his serious <hi>Commands</hi> for slight <hi>Advices</hi> left to our pleasure to follow or forbear; false Glosses put upon the Oracles of God by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended infallible Interpreters; the defeating that mighty Engine of Obedience to Christ, which is the affectionate Meditation upon his Death and Passion, his direfull Sufferings for us, by diverting of our Thoughts and distracting them by several insignificant Objects, pety Advocates and Patrons, that run away with our Devotions, and rob Christ of his honour, and our Souls of the chief means of their Sanctification and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: These, with several other particulars I might instance in, are plain Antichristian Assaults and Oppugnations of <hi>the Divine Life in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,</hi> and tend to the sweeping of all away before them.</p>

And yet we may conceive a further <hi>Antichristian</hi> poison, that will wonderfully damp and benumme men in all their endeavours after true Sanctity; and that is <hi>easy Absolution</hi> and <hi>slight Penance</hi> after <hi>formal Confession.</hi> For Confession, which is so rigorously extorted by this Antichristian Church I am now describing, being accompanied with a conceit that upon their <hi>Absolution</hi> and performance of imposed <hi>Penances</hi> they are then right and straight, and in as secure a condition as if they had never sinned; the just chastisements of their offended Consciences being slaked by the soft and false interposal of the Priest's pretended Authority to absolve where God has bound, (as certainly every one is bound over to that eternal doom at the last day, let the Priest pretend the power of loosing him here as much as he will; and he shall answer for what he has done in the flesh, which no Absolution nor Penance can clear him from, unless he really forsake his wicked ways, and become a sincere Convert to God;) I say, from this constitution of things touching <hi>Absolution</hi> and <hi>Penance,</hi> it must needs follow that the raines will be let loose on the necks of all men, they being given to understand what a slight thing it is to sin against God, when they can have their reconcilement upon such easy terms. Whenas it would be a greater awe upon mens spirits to let them be condemned or acquitted by their own Consciences, being so well assisted by the Word of God and the Light of Reason and Nature to lay the Law against them, and never to leave urging them till they have emerged into a competent sincerity of heart: Which when they have arrived to, Christ within them and his Word without them will absolve them and give them peace of mind; and, if need be, they may also receive <hi>Absolution</hi> from some sober and faithfull Priest, whose honesty and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplarity of life has fitted him for so serious a function, as I have intimated above, where I had slipt aforehand into this Argument.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. But the most outrageous <hi>Antichristian</hi> effort against the <hi>Divine Life</hi> would be the persuasion that upon the paying of certain tolerable summes of mony, and doing some slight superstitious performances or other, they shall obtain by virtue of the supreme Ecclesiastick Authority plenary <hi>Indulgences</hi> and <hi>Pardons</hi> for vast numbers of years, and the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of freeing of themselves or their friends from Purgatory.</p>
                        <p>As, for example, suppose that some Churches, or, if you will, many,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:42932:73"/>
may have purchased from the Ecclesiastick Sovereignty a perpetuity of ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary <hi>Indulgence,</hi> so that he that prays before such an Altar in this Church should have free remission of all his sins past, and security from punishment. But this is a small matter. Suppose that such a piece of Devotion at some other Altars, and in some other Churches, would procure the pardon of sin and punishment for twenty, thirty, fifty, or an hundred thousand years; and that the saying of such and such Prayers at such an Altar would deliver a Soul out of Purgatory; that the bowing at the Name of <hi>Jesus</hi> may procure <hi>toties, quoties,</hi> twenty years pardon, that the mere stooping to kiss a Cross on the pavement of a Church, an Indulgence or Pardon for all a mans sins; that the pattering over so many Prayers, especially if there be the weight of some consecrated Medal, as an <hi>Agnus Dei</hi> or the like, annexed to them, will save a Soul out of Purgatory; that one Salutation of the Blessed Virgin shall gain eighty years pardon; that the saying a certain short Prayer, devoutly looking on the Picture of Christ, shall obtain ten thousand days of Pardon, and the saying of others no less then ten hundred thousand years; and for but the looking on a certain Crucifix, six thousand years of Pardon.</p>
                        <p>These intimations would be infinite. I have produced so much already as implies such a Constitution in a Church, as nothing can be more op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite to or destructive of that Life and Holiness Christ came to plant in the World, and therefore cannot but be judged very soully <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian.</hi>

The <hi>Falseness</hi> and unjustifiableness of these proceedings I need not goe about to evince, they being so damnable at first sight: nor point at the <hi>Fraud,</hi> it being so conspicuous; which is, as I have above inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated in like cases, the emunging of the people of their mony: And the <hi>Mischief</hi> is here the Opposition or Extinction of the <hi>Divine Life,</hi> as it will be likewise in the <hi>Root</hi> and <hi>Branches.</hi> So that we need hereafter note no other <hi>Mischiefs</hi> then will be comprized in the Subject we shall be upon, the <hi>Mischiefs</hi> being expressed in the very Titles of the Argument. Which I thought fit here to note once for all; and would proceed to the delineating of the next <hi>Limb of Antichristianism,</hi> did there not one consideration more offer it self to my mind, that would help to make the state of the Church very Stepdame-like to any offers toward growth and increase in life and Godliness. Which supposition is this.</p>

Let us imagine that either a mighty party of the Ecclesiasticks had plotted it so, or the Ambition of one Bishop with some few adherents, being back'd with opportunities, and wanting no wit, policy, nor industry, had brought it about to be so, that he and his Successours should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, and by a very considerable part accepted for, the <hi>Universal Bishop of the World,</hi> should be esteemed of an Authority more sacred, high and glorious then of any Emperour or Potentate upon earth: that there should be substituted under him several Orders, some of very high degree, which should be, as it were, so many <hi>Ecclesiastick Princes,</hi> equal in a manner for Pomp and Splendour to the Kings of the Earth; besides Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs, Metropolitans, and many other very rich and illustrious Ranks of the Priesthood, the Church in the interim abounding with sundry

sorts of very creditable and profitable Preferments to bear out all.</p>
                        <p>Why, thus far, you will say, is very good news, and it were desirable it were so indeed, That Religion being the most Sacred and precious thing in the world, those that are in a more special manner the Supporters and Pillars thereof should be the most richly splendid and adorned.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. I do confess so a man would think at first sight. For it seems but a respect to God, whose Servants they are by a more peculiar dedication. But by the same reason our Churches should be as well the most splendid as the most ample Buildings, especially there being no danger of infecting these walls of stone with either the sense of Pride or any other uncomely Passion.</p>
                        <p>But suppose that these pretended living Stones of the Temple of God were as unexcitable to Pride or Lust as the dead Stones of the walls of a Church; though this extreme glory and pomp and excessfull affluency of the World might doe them no hurt as to their Manners, yet I believe they would profess they found little good in it, unless it were in being Treasurers for the Poor, (which would be something a Secular employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) or in giving testimony to the World, that Christian Happiness consists not in these things; which yet the World would not think them serious in, unless they did actually quit them. And for the external pomp and splendidness of their own Persons, it is credible they would declare that if the Houses of God, I mean the external Churches, were at least decently, if not in some case gloriously, adorned, their eyes could better view that and with more pleasure then any Imperial Ornaments on their own head and back, which they could not well see without the help of Looking-glasses.</p>
                        <p>This would be a greater pleasure to them, as also to see no poor but such as were wholesomely and handsomely apparrell'd, not so squalidly and forlornly that they appear as ungratefull Eye-sores in Providence.</p>
                        <p>But to make rich Miters and costly Habiliments for a S. <hi>Peter</hi> or S. <hi>Paul,</hi> were not indeed to make a Coat for the Moon, but (which is as ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous) to make a golden Cope for the Sun, as if his native splendour did not out-shine all such artificial Ornaments. The gorgeousness of Apparrel may make the person that wears it to be gazed or stared upon; but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spotted Holiness and Vertue will make the possessour thereof truely reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced and adored.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. This excessive Grandeur therefore in the Governours of the Church, though they were as holy as the Apostles themselves, would not seem necessary, nor requisite, nor, it may be, at all desirable.

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:42932:75"/>
pursuit of what lies so temptingly in their view, and that hellish fire of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition will be the very life and soul of the Church; all her activity and motion deriving it self from that hatefull Principle. Whence it will follow that nothing but the name of <hi>Spirituality</hi> will be left, the minds of the Clergie being totally drawn off from meditating what is true, holy and edifying, and quite drown'd and immerst in the affairs of the world.</p>
                        <p>For such are also <hi>Ecclesiastick Preferments,</hi> when they are sought after to satisfie the lust of the eyes, the lust of the flesh and the pride of life.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. Nor will this mischief stop here, I mean in the neglect of Holy and Divine Meditation, and of either usefull or generous Enquiries after Truth; but every one being exalted in the conceit and apprehension of his own place and dignity, especially he whose Superiority is so vast as to pretend to be the <hi>Universal Bishop of Christendom, and higher then all the Kings of the Earth,</hi> they will be driven on so far with that furious spirit of <hi>Ambition,</hi> that they will not onely neglect, but oppose, every thing that is sacred and holy, if it stand in competition with any devised method of getting in Riches to the Church, that they may Lord it, and carry it out bravely, every man in his respective Office and Dignity.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore the genuine Simplicity of Christian Religion shall be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and adulterated, and Laws and Articles devised by this <hi>Infallible</hi> Priesthood, that are point-blank against the Laws of Christ and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable Rules of sound Reason: The ears of all men will be filled with deceitfull Figments and gainfull Lies, such as we have already produced many Instances of; the Merits of Christ's Passion vilified and maimed; Truth and Justice banished, persecuted and oppressed; the Old and New Testament made but a dumb and dead letter that has no sense nor infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in it, but all Dictates must be immediate from the Church that is resolved to dictate nothing that is against her worldly advantage: that is to say, The <hi>two Witnesses</hi> must be slain, and their carcasses lie breathless in the streets; otherwise those that <hi>dwell on the Earth</hi> (not those that <note place="margin">Apoc. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

1. WE will now proceed to those main parts of the <hi>Divine Life,</hi> the <hi>Root</hi> and the <hi>Branches.</hi> Where it is obvious to take notice that what deads the <hi>Root,</hi> whereby the whole Tree must necessarily wither, cannot but be Antichristian to the highest pitch. Wherefore if I describe such a management of Affairs in the Church as naturally tends to the extinguishing of <hi>Faith,</hi> which is the necessary <hi>Root</hi> of the other Divine Graces, no man will doubt but that I have delineated a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Limb of <hi>Antichristianism.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. Of which the first point is what we last of all touched upon: Such a Frame of Government, and such sublimities of Dignities, as would lapse the Church, and immerse it into the World, and thereby make them that should be <hi>the Salt of the Earth,</hi> an unsavoury masse, and of a secular, dead, insipid spirit, relishing nothing of the Kingdom of God, but wholy taken up with the Profits and Promotions of this present life. For they would thereby look so like <hi>Unbelievers</hi> themselves, that they would stagger the <hi>faith</hi> of all those under them, and make them think that there was nothing to be expected after this life, because their Leaders and Guides lived so exactly according to that Principle, <hi>That there is nothing to be expected hereafter.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. Secondly, The Exquisiteness of their Order and Policy in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging the affairs of their Ecclesiastick Empire, if it did surpass all the Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Industry of Secular Princes, and if all those Doctrines and Duties which were most urged and most frequently came into practice were of such a nature as did plainly tend to the either Honour, Power or Profit of the Priesthood; This, I say, would strike very far towards the making the World Infidels, or believers of nothing but this, That the Summe of our Religion is but a witty Invention of so many fictitious Stories, Doctrines, Precepts and Ceremonies, which would serve to hamper the Consciences of men, and make the World more Governable; but so shaped out by the Priests, as made most for their worldly advantage. And such we have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy described the Tenents and Doctrines of this Church to be, continuedly displaying the <hi>Frauds</hi> and <hi>Self-endedness</hi> of all their Errours and Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practices, and need not here again repeat them.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Thirdly, This also would oppose the Christian <hi>Faith,</hi> To make the nature of it such, that it must be always doubtfull. Of which I must confess I know not what may be the fetch, unless it be to keep mens Minds, as some deceitfull Physicians and Surgeons do their Bodies, in such an unsound and valetudinarious condition, that they may have the more frequent recourse to them, and depend the more upon them: or because they mixe some things in Religion necessarily to be believed, which it is impossible they should be firmly believed by any but fools. And thus the true and solid points of Christianity, such as have sufficient evidence to convince any ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap> of Reason, must be reputed obscure and uncertain for being found in the company of such gross Falsities or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties, which yet pretend to an equal right of entire reception with the clearest Truths.</p>
                        <p>And further, It is no wonder that such a Church as places whatever
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:42932:77"/>
certainty there is of Faith upon her own <hi>Infallibility,</hi> as if that were the ground of it, should derive both an opinion and profession of the <hi>Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of Belief</hi> upon her Nurselings; they having no better ground then what we have so plainly demonstrated already to be hollow and ruinous.</p>
                        <p>But it is their onely Shift and Refuge, to make their <hi>Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> the ground of Belief, the matters they propose to be believed having no recommendation either from Scripture or their own nature to be embraced. And therefore things being thus uncertain at the bottom, upon their Principles, they must instead of a firm and solid Faith be content with an obscure and uncertain one. Which is indeed the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying of <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> and the substituting of a more vertiginous fluctuation of mind in lieu thereof.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Fourthly, That Principle also tends to the ruining of <hi>Faith,</hi> which supposes That without right Succession of Bishops and Priests there is no true Church, and therefore no true Faith; and that this Succession may be interrupted by the misordination or misconsecration of a Priest or Bishop, the persons thus ordained or consecrated being Atheists or Jews, or ordained by them that are so, or do out of malice not intend what they ought in the <hi>Sacrament of Orders,</hi> as some call it. Which were a conceit able to turn all men <hi>Scepticks</hi> concerning their state in Religion; but is a Position absolutely against inward sense and Reason. As if a man could not feel in his own conscience whether he believed or not the Truths of Holy Scripture, without he were first assured that he was a member of that Church that had an uninterrupted lawfull Succession of the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood from the Apostles times till his own. Whenas there is nothing more immediate to a man then <hi>inward sense,</hi> which it is not in the power of any Sophistry ever to confute.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Wherefore though this Position may be spightfully levelled against the <hi>Certainty of Faith,</hi> yet the execution it can doe upon the considerate is very inconsiderable and small: much like that peevish Supposition of the necessity of <hi>Unity of Opinion;</hi> as if those Churches that did differ in any thing, had the certainty of nothing. An excellent Hypothesis indeed, were it but true, and such as would effectually recommend the usefulness of an <hi>Infallible Judge of Controversies,</hi> if he could be had for love or mony, by whom they might closely compact the parts of the Church Catholick together, as with cramps of Iron.</p>
                        <p>But there is no such force in the Theorem, which will of it self fall asunder into dust, if we consider it can stand upon no other terms then what will supplant the truth of all Reason and Religion in the world; the whole world being divided in their judgments and conclusions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning both. Whence it is plain that the Attempt, though weak, tends to the bringing in <hi>universal Scepticism</hi> in all things. In which deluge the <hi>Christian Faith</hi> would be also drowned, and perish with all other Truths, there being no Ark left to take Sanctuary in, and to be safe from the working and absorptive waves of this reciprocating <hi>Euripus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="7">7. But sixthly, and I shall now instance in what is not onely ill-meant, but must needs have a successfull efficacy for making the World <hi>Atheists</hi>
                           <pb n="133" facs="tcp:42932:77"/>
or <hi>Infidels;</hi> and that is, The glutting of them with <hi>lying Miracles,</hi> and gulling of them with delusions and cousening devices, call them <hi>pious Frauds</hi> or by what other fine names you please. For the <hi>Falsehood</hi> being once discovered in such a Church as requires to be believed more upon their own Authority and Infallibility then upon the credibility of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which they propound, I say, if they once be taken tardy in Forgeries and guilefull Fictions in any points, especially such as tend to their own profit, how can this fail of shaking or rather ruining the whole Frame of belief to the very Foundations? How ruinous then must the <hi>Christian Faith</hi> be, where such Lies and Figments are frequent, and almost as frequently discovered by those that are more nasute? Certainly <hi>Atheism</hi> and <hi>Infidelity</hi> must break in upon such a Church as the Sea upon the cutting of the Banks.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. That I may the better be understood, I will give you some brief Instances of these impudent Figments. As, for example, <q>If they should have the face to tell the people, that such a Saint, when his Head was struck off, walked four or five mile with it in his hand, onely resting himself every mile's end to take breath at his open weasen-pipe. That another Saint being hospitably entertained at the expence of the lives of a Cow and a Calf, restored them again to life, and that they were both of them found the next day in their Master's Meadows. That by another Saint the Devil was seen behind the Altar busily writing down mens sins in a parchment, which being something too scant, he stretched with his teeth, and his hold slipping, knocked his head against the wall, That a certain She-Saint being swallowed by a Dragon, she ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a Crosse in the Dragon's belly, burst him in pieces, and so was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. That a Bishop having cut off his own hand upon its being pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the kiss of some over-affectionate female, it was suddenly set on again, and healed by prayers addressed to the Blessed Virgin. The like whereof happened to another Saint whose legs were cut off at the knees: and to the head of another, which being cut off, sprung up and grew on again, but lopt off the second time, by its fall gave the rise to a Fountain or Well. And lastly, that another She-Saint being by ropes to be haled to execution, was so strong upon Crossing herself and calling upon the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> that a whole Team of Oxen could not drag her to the place.</q>

That also would be a delicious Figment concerning some Saints, that they have had personal converse with the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and that she has been so kind to some, that she has emptied her Breasts into their mouths on their sick beds to their unspeakable comfort. It were likewise a good roosing miracle, and bigger then belief, that a certain Holy House of the Virgin's should be carried out of <hi>Palestine</hi> into <hi>Italy</hi> by an invisible hand through the aire. Surely the Angels of God would be very worthily employ'd in removing such stone-work and timber-work. For a <hi>Crucifix</hi> also to take some fifty miles journey through the same element in a night, were a pretty Figment to furnish out the Faith of Fools.

                        <p>There might be also fine devices for the magnifying of the Holiness of the <hi>Priest,</hi> in making such things as come from his body seem to have the virtue of scaring away the Devil: As suppose the Devil be made to appear more impatient when the Priest's glove, hose, girdle, or shirt be applied to any part of the possessed; which may be <hi>ex pacto,</hi> as well as in the conciliating the opinion of such virtues in the <hi>Image</hi> or <hi>Reliques</hi> of this or that Saint.

And therefore it would be a very Antichristian piece of Knavery for any Priest to use any such jugglings under what pious pretence so ever: As by putting on some Histrionical accoutrements to act the part of an Angel, or of the blessed Virgin descended from Heaven in glory, or of some Ghost from the Infernal parts with wan and ghastly looks, and cold and earthly hands; and in these disguises to visit the perplexed, for either the corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating of them in the belief of that Religion which they have already en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained, or for the recommendation of that Religion they endeavour to proselyte them to. Another Example of which kind would be, the contrivance of moving Lights in Church-yards, by fastning wax-Candles on the backs of live Crab-fishes, which must be interpreted the unquiet Souls of them that are tortured in Purgatory, and seek relief by the Prayers and Offerings of good people.</p>

                        <p n="17">17. But eighthly, and lastly, The Incredible of all Incredibles and the greatest Impossibility of all Impossibilities were that pretended My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of <hi>Transsubstantiation,</hi> which being urged with the like necessity and assurance of Truth that any thing is urged by this Antichristian Church, whose Picture I am a-drawing, will doe the most fatal execution upon the <hi>Christian Faith</hi> that any thing imaginable can doe. For sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing this the most Fundamental Article of their Creed, or, if you will, the most precious and the most seriously-urged Fundamental of them all, and the very hindge of almost all their publick Devotion and God-service; if this break, all must fall to the ground. For if the Church be found shamelesly false in so important a Point as this, it does immediately follow that she will be believed in nothing.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore they whose belief was either wholly or mainly sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the seeming greatness of her Authority, this failing by the easy discovery of so gross a Falsehood, (and yet by her most earnestly and most seriously avowed for Truth,) the Faith of every such man must also necessarily fail, unless by some special grace of God assisting his conference with the persons or writings of some better-instructed Christians, which he may haply meet with in this vast Wilderness he wanders in, he be stopt from splitting himself a-pieces from this dangerous precipice he stands on, and from the plunging himself into the mire of <hi>Atheism</hi> and <hi>Unbelief.</hi>

For undoubtedly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if he have no other help but this Pseudo-christian Synagogue, though he may be awed by their external lash from professing his <hi>Infidelity,</hi> yet it will be impossible for him to hinder the tacit growth of it in his own Soul; but he will
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:42932:79"/>
naturally disgust and disclaim all hearty commerce with Religion; and even loath it as a pack of lies.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore it is impossible but this congregation of Impostours and Deceivers (which I am setting forth in the truest colours I can) should swarm with multitudes of grown and obdurate <hi>Atheists.</hi> For the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posture we speak of now being so signal, and the discovery so easy and obvious, how can it chuse but be discovered even by multitudes of people?</p>
                        <p>For the account comes onely to this, Whether it be more likely that the Church for her own advantage (which I perceive she does every-where eagerly and stiffly pursue) may knowingly and wittingly impose upon me, or at least mistake in her own judgment, (of the <hi>Infallibility</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I have no proof but her own boast, when it is in the mean time her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest to boast so) I say, the account comes onely to this, Whether it be more likely that she may practise fraud, or fall into a mistake out of some blind Superstition; or that by the uttering of <hi>Five words</hi> a Priest should have such a power as to turn a piece of <hi>Bread</hi> into a <hi>Man,</hi> the <hi>Bread</hi> according to all my Senses being as much <hi>Bread</hi> as it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Which is a double Miracle, and greater then ever was yet done in the world considered but thus far; and almost as great a Miracle that any one should believe it.</p>
                        <p n="19">19. But there are still greater, I cannot say <hi>Miracles,</hi> but down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right <hi>Impossibilities.</hi> As first, <q>That this Bread is not turned into a Man that was to be, but that was already in being: Which is the hardest Non-sense that can be offered to the mind of man to think upon. And yet, in the second place, the Bread is so turned into a Man, that is to say into the Man Christ, that he is entirely in every place where this consecrated Bread seems to be, that is, in thousands of places at once at very large distances: Which is as perfect a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction as any can be proposed, That one and the same Body should be entirely distant from it self. For how can it be <hi>One,</hi> being thus divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from it self; since <hi>Unity</hi> consists in <hi>Indivision,</hi> and <hi>Self-Unity</hi> certainly is <hi>Self-Indivision?</hi> Wherefore if there be one Self at <hi>Oxford,</hi> suppose, and another at <hi>Cambridge</hi> at the same time, it is impossible it should be one and the same Person; their distance or division de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrating them two distinct ones. And thirdly and lastly, From this false supposition, <hi>That one and the same Body may be at the same time in several places,</hi> it will also follow, That one and the same Person or Body may be at the same time wholly within it self and wholly without it self, wholly above it self and wholly beneath it self, on the right hand of it self and on the left hand of it self: That it may be <hi>One</hi> Body, and yet <hi>many</hi> Bodies at once, or rather no Body, but a Spirit, or, to speak more truly, Nothing: That one and the same Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son may meet himself and complement himself, may at the same time move and rest, lie along and walk, be many miles absent from his friend and present with him at once, may be now in Heaven and then in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the Earth, without passing any of the Regions betwixt; with many such like Incongruities, which we having above noted, it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less any longer here to insist upon.</q>

20. It is already plain enough that <hi>Transsubstantiation,</hi> or the turning of the Bread into the very Body of Christ, is encumbred with so many and so manifestly gross Impossibilities and easily deprehensible, that the Impossibility of the Churche's either ignorantly erring or volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily imposing uponmen for her own gain, can bear no weight at all to turn the scales in her behalf; but there will be such an irresistible moment of these apparent and plain Contradictions of this so boldly obtruded Article of the Church, I mean this of <hi>Transsubstantiation,</hi> that the weight thereof will naturally sink all her sons that but a little consider of it (if nothing better then their Church help them and buoy them up) into the abhorred pit of Infidelity first, and then of Hell.</p>
                        <p n="21">21. For there is no plastering over such Impossibilities (which are deprehended to be such according to the Universal and Immutable Laws of Reason) by feigned Miracles, to give countenance thereto. As if they should make such Stories as these; <q>That the Sacrament being struck with a dagger, did bleed: That when the <hi>Bread,</hi> as was thought, was taken out of the mouth of the Communicant, it proved <hi>Flesh</hi> in the fingers of the Priest: That the Host has dropt many drops of bloud upon the Corporall, as it has been taken into the Priest's hands: That it has flown out of his hands round about the Church, dropping drops of bloud on the Marble pavement all the time of its flight: That a love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fair Child has been seen sometimes to appear out of the consecrated Bread; and the like.</q> For these Stories could not evince the truth of that which is impossible to be true, but would argue their own false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness by the end of their producement. For commonly liers back lies with lies.</p>
                        <p n="22">22. And now I think I have described so plentifully and punctually this particular Limb of <hi>Antichristianism,</hi> which is opposite to the <hi>Root</hi> of the Divine Life, <hi>Faith,</hi> that nothing can be conceived wanting to the perfection of such a Contrariety, nor any man doubt but that Church which is thus described is really one and the same with that which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded out of the <hi>New Jerusalem,</hi> as being opposite to her inhabitants.</p>
                        <p>For from such a Constitution of things as I have here in this member of Antichristianism set forth, it will plainly follow, that the professed sons of this false Church (as those in the <note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 21. &amp; Chap. 22.</note> Apocalyps) must be <gap reason="foreign">

Let us therefore dip our pencil a little deeper in some of those co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours which we made use of in the Description of that member of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christianism</hi> which was opposite to the <hi>Divine Life in general,</hi> and pourtray out more fully such an Ecclesiastick Polity as will appear most oriently <hi>Luciferian</hi> and <hi>Antichristian,</hi> and most diametrically opposite to that holy <hi>Humility</hi> that was recommended by Christ to his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours.
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:42932:81"/>
We will therefore suppose, as before, some one Prelate, that has got the start of the rest, to put in for the Title and Authority of <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Bishop:</hi> which whosoever does was declared by <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great the <hi>Fore-runner of Antichrist,</hi> the Fore-runner of that <hi>Rex Superbiae cui Sacerdotum praeparatur exercitus.</hi> Which is a sign that in <hi>Gregory</hi>'s judgment <hi>Antichrist</hi> was not to be born of the Tribe of <hi>Dan,</hi> but of the Tribe of <hi>Levi;</hi> whom we will further suppose to lay about him for the obtaining of this <hi>Levitical</hi> Sovereignty, and for the advancement of his Episcopal Chair successively, in some such manner as follows.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. First, he will pretend that it is unfit that the visible Catholick Church being <hi>One,</hi> should not be united under <hi>One visible Head.</hi> Which reasoning yet, though it make a pretty show at first sight, being closely lookt into, will vanish into smoke: For this is but a quaint concinnity urged in the behalf of an impossibility. For the erecting such an Office for one man, which no one man in the world is able to perform, implies that to be possible which is indeed impossible. Whence it is plain that the <hi>Head</hi> will be <hi>too little for the Body,</hi> which therefore will be a piece of mischievous Asym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry or Inconcinnity also. No one Mortal can be a competent <hi>Head</hi> for that Church which has a right to be <hi>Catholick,</hi> and to over-spread the face of the whole Earth. There can be no such <hi>Head</hi> but <hi>Christ,</hi> who is not mere Man, but God invested in Humane nature, and therefore is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent with every part of his Church and every member thereof at what distances soever.</p>
                        <p>But to set some one Bishop over the whole Church, were to suppose that great Bishop of our Souls absent from it, who has promised <hi>he will be with her to the end of the World;</hi> and, you may be sure, not an idle Spectatour, but a carefull Feeder and Governour of their Souls who do really believe in him and unfeignedly obey him.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Nor does the Church-<hi>Catholick</hi> on Earth lose her <hi>Unity</hi> hereby; for she is under <hi>One common Head</hi> of the whole Church as well Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant as Militant, which (to come nearer to the Objection) is a <hi>Visible Head</hi> of his Church to those that can approach his Court, in that glorious Metropolis in Heaven; where undoubtedly he is to be seen sitting on his Sapphire Throne in great Majesty and Glory, and where his true Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in a small space of time may either see him themselves, or at least converse with them that have frequent recourse unto him and wait in his presence.</p>
                        <p>And no man, I think, will say that any large Empire has an <hi>Invisible Head,</hi> because the Emperour himself has placed his Palace in the chiefest Province of his Empire, and never comes within the view of some parts of his Dominion, and multitudes of men never see him, as never having the opportunity of visiting those parts where the Emperour's Court is. Whereas <hi>Jesus</hi> Christ, the <hi>Head of his Church,</hi> was seen here on Earth for a good space, as also visibly to travel hence into the higher Regions of his Kingdom, and in due time will visibly return hither again, to take account of the Administratours of his Affairs in these lower Provinces. Wherefore Christ is a more <hi>visible Head</hi> in his large Empire then any Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour in his: So evident is it that there wants no <hi>One Visible Head</hi> of the Church, besides Christ himself.</p>
                        <p n="5">
                           <pb n="141" facs="tcp:42932:81"/>
5. But yet notwithstanding all this, this ambitious Patriarch I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe will bear the world in hand, that it is very fit there should be <hi>One visible Head of the Church Universal,</hi> which should succeed Christ, or rather some one whom he would pretend to be Prince of the Apostles, and that his Seat is that Apostolical Seat, and that there is a necessity for Unity in the Church, and for slaking all controversies there should be some one such; though the Plea to any indifferent man cannot but seem very weak and frivolous. For, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap>as I have already intimated, the Church will be sufficiently <hi>One</hi> by being under that <hi>One Head Christ Jesus,</hi> and under <hi>One Law,</hi> which is the <hi>Word of God;</hi> which has been already proved sufficiently plain in all things necessary to Life and Salvation. But for other things, whether <hi>Ceremonies</hi> or <hi>Conceits,</hi> they do not at all break the <hi>Unity</hi> of Christ's Kingdom, but it will be truly and conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuously his, so long as it professes the Faith of his Apostles; let them otherwise use what difference of <hi>Rites</hi> they will, or differ as much as they can in <hi>unnecessary Opinions:</hi> provided always that none of these <hi>Rites</hi> or <hi>Opinions</hi> be really and plainly against the Apostolical Doctrines, which are the universal and irreversible Law of Christ's Empire upon Earth. For thus the <hi>Church-Catholick</hi> being in this sort variegated in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternals, will yet be visibly the <hi>Spouse of Christ,</hi> though <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, though cloathed with a Vestment of various flower-work and colours.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. But for this high-flown Patriarch to pretend that his Seat is this Infallible and All-decisive Apostolical Seat, is a Plea that can have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing solid at the bottom. For if there had been any such Prelation of some one of the Apostles over the rest, it were of that great Moment (if ending of Controversies in all succeeding Ages be of that Moment) that it would have been recorded in the Scripture, and would have ended or prevented all disceptations amongst the Apostles themselves or any others concerning them. But quite contrary S. <hi>Paul</hi> declares that he is <hi>in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing inferiour to the chiefest Apostles;</hi> which plainly implies an Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.</note> amongst them all.</p>
                        <p>Besides, if it were so that some one Apostle had an Authority or Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship over the rest, and had once his Residence in such a particular See; it does not follow that he that succeeds him in that See should succeed him in that Headship, or at all in his Apostleship, but onely in his Bishoprick: Nor is it credible that if this Prime and <hi>Oecumenical</hi> Apostle had designed his immediate Successour to the same latitude of Jurisdiction, that the claim should not be made and acknowledged by the Universal Church in those more innocent and morigerous times. Of so little weight are such pretences as these.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. But if such pretty Sophisms will not serve the turn, since Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has inflamed the Patriarch's spirits, he will leave no stone unmoved to accomplish his desire; and what Sophistry cannot doe, must be effected, though by the coursest methods of either Worldly or Infernal policy. That they may therefore obtain this absolute Ecclesiastick Sovereignty, the Successours in this pretended prime Apostolical See we will suppose to stick at nothing: But that they will forge or counterfeit Canons of
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:42932:82"/>
Authentick Councils; and make them speak for the Supremacy of their Patriarchate; that they will countenance, abet or allow Treasons and Murthers, though upon Emperours and Emperesses, Kings and Queens, and their whole Posterity, by some intrusted Instrument of State, whose ambition instigated him thus bloudily to assassinate his Liege Sovereign, that he might succeed him in his Kingdom or Empire. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon notwithstanding, by parasitical fawning, conniving, or allowing, nay by congratulating the success of so beastly an enterprize, these eager Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didates for the Ecclesiastick Empire will not stick to endeavour to gain the good will of this new Usurper, though his hands be yet reeking with bloud, that they may thereby obtain of him this glorious and beneficial Title of <hi>Universal Bishop;</hi> nor upon the obtaining thereof forbear any cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties to such Bishops as will detrect this new imposed yoke.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. Which prize they having once gotten, we suppose they will not stick here, but will still by craft encroach upon the <hi>Secular Power.</hi> For this <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Bishop</hi> will plausibly require an <hi>Oath of Obedience</hi> from all other Bishops in what Kingdoms soever; which is no less wickedness then to ensnare them in a way to treachery and perfidiousness to their own So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigns, and to make them indeed betrayers of their own liberty: For they being thus loosened and alienated from their proper Princes, are made indeed the more firm to this great <hi>Patriarch Oecumenical,</hi> but withall his surer Vassals to be dealt with in Impositions and Fees and what-ever other Injunctions, as he pleases.</p>
                        <p>For we suppose they will also wring out of the <hi>Secular Princes</hi> hand (upon pretence of their being the highest Sovereignty in <hi>Ecclesiastick</hi> Affairs) the Right of <hi>Investitures,</hi> thereby to make all Bishops less de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent on the <hi>Temporal Sovereignty,</hi> and more endeared to the <hi>Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick See,</hi> but still more enslaved thereto, as I noted before, and without remedy, if oppressed thereby, whether by removing all considerable <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals</hi> out of the Bishop's Court respective into that Apostolick Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or by what other aggrievances soever. But the Aggrievance of <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals</hi> alone is so great, as if all Christendome were set on the rack, or, if you will, torturously drawn together with the Cramp, to fit the transaction of Affairs to the forced Universality and Interest of this <hi>Vicar-General of Christ.</hi> And yet it will be so according to this Hypothesis, to maintain the Pomp and Ambition of one Universal Domineering Prelate.</p>
                        <p>They will also get the whole body of the <hi>Clergy</hi> exempt from all <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Judicatures;</hi> they being, indeed, by these successfull devices made properly the Subjects of this Ecclesiastick Monarch. But by this feat they do most grossly defraud all Secular Potentates of as many Subjects as there are men of Religious Orders in Christendom, they being <hi>ipso facto</hi> made the Subjects of this <hi>King of Pride,</hi> (as <hi>Gregory</hi> in a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinatory rapture called him,) and not to be tried at any Secular Tribunal, no not for Murther, Robbery, House-breaking, or what other crime soever. Which Immunity, as it cannot but make them proud and insolent to the <hi>Laiety,</hi> as they call them; so must it, as I noted before, more throughly enslave the Clergie to
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:42932:82"/>
this Ecclesiastick Tyrant. For they can rationally expect no succour from those Princes whose Sovereignty they have slipt from under, and consequently from under their Protection, by these Religious Frauds, and therefore lie wholly at the mercy of him whom the greatness of his Title and Pontifical Pomp, exceeding so infinitely his just Revenues, must make a severe exacter of Tribute from them that are most appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priately under his power, and thereby put them to unworthy shifts and sharkings upon the people by pious, or rather impious, Sleights and Frauds, he sending out and dispersing these Birds of his in numerous flocks, to be his hungry Pick-peny's throughout the whole Pastorage of the Empire.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. Thus great a Pride proportionably fed with the injury of others, and especially of the Bishops and other Clergie whom this Tyrannical high-Priest would pill and poll as he pleases, is discoverable already in the Draught we are a-making of this Member of <hi>Antichristianism.</hi> But it would be still heightened, if we should imagine further extravagancies. As suppose, if this Universal Priest should not be content to be <hi>Supreme Bishop,</hi> but put in to out-top the <hi>Emperour</hi> himself, and should most wretchedly and treacherously watch a safe occasion (as, suppose, while the Imperial forces are generously and faithfully employ'd to beat the Common Enemy out of Christendom, whether <hi>Turks</hi> or <hi>Saracens)</hi> to raise war against the Emperour and his adherents in those parts nearest his own See, to beat him thence, to make room for an opportunity of nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming away some share of the Empire to himself.</p>
                        <p>Certainly it were an high strain of <hi>Ambition</hi> that could move any to such Devillish practices. What then were it for this Cunning Prelate to send this or that Prince on holy Expeditions, on purpose to cheat them of their Dominions, or fleece them of their Revenues? What to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve great Ministers of State and all the Subjects of a Prince from their Oaths of Fidelity, and that merely for his own Interest? To take upon him to depose the true Sovereign, and set up another, the liege Subject of the deposed, and who had no right at all to the Crown, for hope of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence proportionable to the greatness of his extravagant presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and for to enrich himself by the ruines of the injured? To be adored as an Omnipotent Plenipotentiary that may doe any thing, and to have his Clients fall down and kiss his feet, and his servants to carry him on their shoulders in procession like the ancient Idols of <hi>Babylon?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="10">10. Nay, what shall we say to this <hi>Holy man's</hi> utterly ruining of the <hi>Eastern Empire</hi> to enrich himself with the rubbish? what to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Deeds of Gift or Donations, to cover over the odiousness of his Rapine? what to the leaving in a manner no Empire at all but what is <hi>Sacerdotal,</hi> raising it above all Kings, Emperours and Christian Princes whatsoever? and this atchieved by such persons as were the most wicked of any that bore the name of <hi>Sovereign Holiness?</hi> whereby we may be the better assured of the <hi>Antichristianism</hi> of the Constitution, it being brought about and established by impure Sorcerers, Murtherers and Poisoners of Princes.</p>
                        <p>That power therefore which one single <hi>Luciferian</hi> Prelate shall thus

procure, by frauds and rapines, by robbing Kings of their Rights, by sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting States and Kingdoms, by the inveagling the Sons of Emperours into Treason, Rebellion and Parricide, by absolving Subjects from their Oaths of Fealty, by involving Christendom in war and bloudshed, by that insolent presumption of Excommunicating Emperours and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates, (they not offending, yea firmly adhering to the Law of Christ) and by disposing of their Dominions as he pleases; if this, I say, be not a right <hi>Idea</hi> of that signal <hi>Antichristian</hi> Power perfectly opposite to that Equity, Sweetness, Meekness and Lowliness of spirit which was so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous in Christ <hi>Jesus,</hi> even in his highest Triumph on Earth, I cannot, nor, I think, any one else, imagine what is.</p>

                        <p n="3">3. The second was his <hi>haughty Insultation over Excommunicated and subdued Princes.</hi> As for example, <q>It were most salvagely Antichristian, for this Triumphant Patriarch after Excommunication, and submission to his power, thereupon to make one Emperour to wait some days toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bare-foot, and clad in Canvass, with his Empress, for Absolution at his gate, and that in the midst of winter; to make him resign his Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Ornaments; and after all this to depose him, and give his Empire to another: To make another prostrate himself publickly in the Church, and in this prostration to set his foot on the Emperour's neck, as if he were crushing an Adder or Snake: To crown another, not with his hands, but with his feet, and then with the same feet to kick the Crown from off the Emperour's head: To make one Prince resign his Crown, and live some days as a private person, and then, upon condition of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a Vassal to his High-priestship, to permit him to receive it again at his Legat's hands, lowly kneeling at his feet: To make another, by way of penance, to go creeping along his Holy-Highnesse's Palace upon his hands and knees, with a Collar about his neck like a Dog: To whip another stark naked in an open Cathedral, every Monk or Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious person bestowing some number of lashes on him.</q> Certainly such gross usage as this of Emperours, Kings and Princes, cannot but be the Indication of a <hi>Pride</hi> and Elation of mind plainly Diabolical.</p>

                           </hi> We will therefore suppose that, according to the known Ceremonies of this Sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotal Court, <q>when his Holy-Highness, Universal Head of the Church, will be something still higher by getting on Horse-back, that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour or King that is present must of duty hold his Stirrup as he gets up; or if his will is upon some occasion to be transported in a Chair of State, that the Emperour and King are to submit their neck to the yoke, and take up this stately Man in his Chair on their shoulders. When this grand Prelate also goeth to dinner, the Emperour or King

there present must have the honour imposed upon them to serve him with Water and a Towel to wash his anointed hands.

The Emperour's place also in an Oecumeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Council shall be at this High-priest's feet, like a good son of <hi>Gama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liel.</hi> And finally, wheresoever this <hi>Oecumenical Patriarch</hi> goes, the people shall fall down on their knees, or if they doe not that Worship willingly and glibly, be knock'd down upon them by his rigid Guard, those grim extorters of the Adoration of this Idol.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">5. This tenour of Ceremonies will plainly place this High-priest many degrees higher then the Princes of the Earth, be they Kings or Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, or what other Potentates soever. But we will now draw a stroke or two of such an <hi>Elation or Haughtiness of spirit in point of Ceremonie and Precedency,</hi> as may make him justly seem to affect a <hi>Sovereignty above that of God himself.</hi> Of which Affectation we have given substantial Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples as touching <hi>Power,</hi> in that he was supposed to cancel the Laws of God, and to substitute in their place some gainful Decrees of his own. Which is a perfect <hi>exalting himself above God in point of Authority</hi> and real Jurisdiction.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. And for <hi>point of good Manners and Ceremony,</hi> If we should imagine that those things which himself and his adherents give the highest Religious Worship to were yet cast lower then this Supreme Prelate, were it not to take precedency of the most High God? As, for example, if the <hi>Cross,</hi> which they judge <hi>Latria</hi> due to, were cast so low as this High-priest's feet, were not he then higher then what the highest kind of Divine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is due to? But this, you will say, perhaps, will but make him <hi>equal</hi> with God.</p>
                        <p>But the <hi>Host</hi> or <hi>consecrated Bread</hi> is already supposed to be esteemed by this Pseudo-Christian Church the very Body of Christ, or his corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Person; that is to say, that where this is, Christ, true God, is truly and corporeally present in his own Person, as truly and really as he is in Heaven. If therefore this Person of Christ, which is ordinarily called the Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, should be less respected then the High-priest that consecrated it, it is plain that he were exalted above it.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore, for example, If in solemn Processions this High-priest should appoint the Ceremonies in such sort, as that this Sacrament, that is to say, according to them, the real Person of <hi>Jesus,</hi> should be placed amongst the less noble of the Pomp, but the High-priest himself in the midst of the most illustrious Princes; that <hi>Jesus</hi> Christ should be carried on an Horse, but the High-priest on the shoulders of Kings and Potentates; that a mean servant of the Sacrist shall lead the Horse that carries Christ <hi>Jesus,</hi> but, if the High-priest be on horse-back at that time, some Prince or Emperour; that the Canopy over <hi>Jesus</hi> Christ shall be carried onely by Citizens of the City, but the Canopy of the High-priest by great No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles or Embassadors: Were not this plainly and palpably <hi>to take place of God Almighty himself,</hi> and to be so proud an <hi>Oecumenical Patriarch,</hi> as to prefer himself before the Eternal Father and Maker of the <hi>Universe?</hi>

High-priest, suppose, should appoint <hi>Jesus</hi> Christ to ride on an ordinary Gennet led by an ordinary Stable-groom, and to <hi>go before;</hi> (there is <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency</hi> indeed) but amongst the baggage of his Retinue, <hi>(Calones, Lixas; &amp; Curtesannas)</hi> to be an Harbinger of his holy Highnesse's coming; him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in the mean time marching fairly on, accompanied with Patriarchs, Archbishops, Bishops, and such like persons of Quality.</p>
                        <p>Surely this would suggest to any musing man a very deep conceit or profound meditation, to wit, how one and the same person according to his circumscribed bodily presence should, at one and the same time, ride on Horse-back here on Earth disgracefully and contemptibly amongst those Scullions and Curtesans, and yet sit in a Throne of Majesty and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the highest Heavens, incircled with the Praises and Adorations of the Holy Angels.</p>
                        <p>But be that how it will, it is in the mean time very manifest that this sublime Priest is so far out in good manners, as well as in usurpation of real right of Jurisdiction, that he does <hi>elate himself above God himself,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own concession, or doctrine of his Church, in appointing thus to himself more honour then to the Itinerant Person of Christ.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. To all which we might further adde this supposition also, That this High-priest at his Inauguration into this Supreme Office might be placed upon the Holy Altar of Christ in some chief Church of his Metropolis, the seet of his Chair of State trampling upon the Sacred Throne of the Body of Christ, and there receive Adoration from his Ecclesiastick Princes and the gazing and amazed People.</p>
                        <p>But I think I have already drawn the <hi>Effigies</hi> of so perfect an <hi>Antichristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Pride,</hi> that nothing need be added thereto, nor the least scruple left, but that he that exalts himself thus high cannot but be <hi>that Man of sin, which</hi>

                        </argument>
                        <p n="1">1. NOr can we imagine the Head so diabolically <hi>proud,</hi> but this poison must diffuse it self into all the Body, and swell up all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thereof in some sort or other. For though this High-priest have a great power over his Clergie themselves, to tax them and fleece them;
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:42932:85"/>
yet they would all of them be not a little puffed up to conceit themselves parts of that Body whose Head is so transcendently raised above all the Princes of the Earth; over whom he having once usurped the Tyranny, and being warm and well settled in his power, he may haply be the more easie and beneficial to his own Tribe. Besides, <hi>their being exempted from all Secular Powers</hi> must needs elate their minds, and make them haughty and domineering, and prone to be injurious, they being able to recoil to such Judges as will be parties for them.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Moreover the <hi>power of receiving Auricular Confession</hi> is a mighty subjugative and insulting Privilege over the poor prostrate Laiety at the feet of their Confessors. And that distinctive Privilege of the <hi>Eucharistick Cup</hi> peculiar to the Priest must needs make the Lay-men lear or Iounge aloof off and look maimedly on't, as acknowledging so vast a distance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them and the Priesthood. All which things tend naturally to the swelling up of this Clergie. How then can they bear that conceit of <hi>the power of creating their Creator,</hi> and of being such Priests as offer the very Body of Christ for a propitiation, and therefore in this regard may conceit themselves in some sense superiour to Christ himself? These are common to the whole Body Sacerdotal.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. But there are also Considerations peculiar, though to great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; as those that are <hi>Sacerdotal Princes</hi> and great Persons in this Church have a peculiar instigation to this Vice. For it were easie to phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy that this mighty High-priest may create <hi>Ecclesiastick Potentates</hi> under him, which may be Co-assessors and sharers with him in this Spiritual Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination over the World; he creating them with some such Form as this, <hi>Estote Fratres mei, &amp; Principes mundi:</hi> which must needs set their spirits at an high pitch.</p>
                        <p>But many Ranks inferiour to these, and yet equal to Secular Princes and Nobles, such as may have the pomp or accommodation of <note n="*" place="margin">Rev. 18. 13.</note>

                        <p n="4">4. And lastly, for those that are yet more numerous, which we may suppose to have put on the vizard of a more peculiar Holiness, listing themselves under the Title and Conduct of this or that Saint, and making a show of <hi>Humility</hi> by wearing some uncouth and sordid Habit, and seeming separate from the World by retiring into lazie and populous Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries, and mortified to the pride and glory of it, while they seek the praise and admiration of men by setting a badge of special Sanctity on themselves by their peculiar. Habiliments and extravagant method of living; I confess it were a miracle to me, if this <hi>self-chosen Sanctity</hi> of theirs, consisting in <hi>meats and drinks and abstaining from marriage,</hi> and the like, did not so puff them up in their carnal conceits, that they may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly be look'd upon as the most genuine Subjects of this <hi>King of Pride.</hi>

5. Besides that the very pretence to this <hi>By-course of Life</hi> may be very impudently turgent to the modest sense of any sober and truly-sanctified Christian, who cannot but esteem it presumptuous to stand upon their own merits, and plead their right to Heaven upon what they could any way doe here on Earth for so inestimable and ineffable a Reward. What an high <hi>Luciferian</hi> Rant then were it in these Spiritual undertakers to pretend that they can doe not onely their own task, but the tasks of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers also?</p>
                        <p>In which pretence there is comprised two of the most hatefull <hi>Specimens</hi> of <hi>Pride</hi> that can be excogitated: namely, the vilifying of the all-sufficient Merits of Christ, as if they were defectuous, and not able to supply the wants of all men to whom God would be propitious, but they must be eeked and patched out by the Supplements of such self-weening wretches; and then an over-estimation and ridiculously-heightned conceit they have of their own Power, Strength and Sanctimony, that they can doe more, and that by way of Merit, then will serve their own turns, or then God requires at their hands. Whenas we are expressely taught by the Holy Scripture to say, That <hi>when we have done all we can, we are unprofitable</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Luke 17. 10. Eph 2. 9.</note> 
                           <hi>servants;</hi> and, that <hi>Salvation is by Faith, not by Works, that no man may boast.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">6. Wherefore we will look upon this High-Priest and Universal Head of this Pseudo-christian Clergie, together with all the several Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Ranks and Orders under it, and by devout acknowledgement sodered and cemented to it and influenced by it, all plumped up with one common spirit of <hi>Pride</hi> and sense of Ruling and Domineering over the persons and consciences of the Laiety, and highly conceited of themselves by reason of these carnal and <hi>external shews of Sanctity</hi> and Supereminency above the rest of the world, which consists onely in <hi>Anointings,</hi> in <hi>Habits,</hi> in <hi>Abstinence from meat,</hi> and the like, which are poor and beggerly Elements, but yet bloating and swelling with a secret poison those that relish them and esteem them and are interessed in the observation of them; I say, we will look upon all these from the highest to the lowest as one Body of one Head, and altogether as <hi>one Man of sin,</hi> who having one spirit and mind against the Law of God and Christ, do exalt themselves against and above both; though some in one manner, others in another. But they having one mind and will and joint consent, are all accessory to all, and are such a Draught and Representation of Antichristian Pride, as nothing can be more, or more absolute. This is he that <note n="*" place="margin">Job 41. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                           <hi>beholdeth all high things, and is the King of the children of Pride;</hi> the highest and most notorious example of a proud and elated Polity as ever yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the World.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. And I think the Text it self may not be misapplied, there being that great affinity betwixt Antichrist and the Devil. And it may be greater betwixt him and some expressions of the Text describing the <hi>Leviathan,</hi> then betwixt the said expressions and his corrival, for the honour of being typified therein. <note n="*" place="margin">Verse 15, 16, 17.</note> 
                           <hi>His Scales are his Pride shut up together as with a close seal. One is so near another that no aire can come betwixt them. They are joyned one to another, they stick together that they cannot be sundred.</hi>
                           <pb n="150" facs="tcp:42932:86"/>
Which we will suppose to be the very boast of this Pseudo-Christian Polity; That they are, as it were, all of one piece, firmly joyned each part to another, though not by any tie of Ingenuity and Love, but riveted and nailed together by the iron hand of Necessity and Tyrannicall Force; Fear of extremity, Joynt-Interest, and Oaths of absolute Obedience to an Infallible Power, holding them as close together as these brazen shields or sealed scales of the <hi>Leviathan.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And now if we consider the Head of this monster, His <hi>Eyes</hi> are said to be <note n="*" place="margin">Verse 18.</note> 
                           <hi>like the Eye-lids of the morning,</hi> that is, very lofty and supercilious, splendid and glorious, as we have already described the Pomp of this Superlative Head to be. But <note n="*" place="margin">Verse 19, 20, 21.</note>

                        <p n="1">1. WE return to the pursuit of the matter in hand, and pass on to the next <hi>Antichristian</hi> Opposition; and that is against the Second Branch of the <hi>Divine Life,</hi> which is <hi>Purity.</hi> Where omitting to speak of <hi>Hypocrisie,</hi> which is one kind of <hi>Impurity,</hi> and which cannot scape being very frequent in such a Religion as I have hitherto described, that consists so much in outward shows and superficiary Formalities; we will direct our pencil to the drawing of such an Image of <hi>Impurity</hi> as is more gross and fulsome, the chief parts whereof are <hi>Fornication, Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery</hi> and <hi>Sodomie.</hi> I say therefore, that if the very Frame and Complexion of Ecclesiastick Polity or Doctrine were such as did naturally either ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitate or encourage such Uncleannesses as these, were not this a pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable Antichristian opposing of that <hi>Christian Purity</hi> unto which we are all called?</p>
                        <p n="2">2. And such a Frame I conceive were this that I now shall delineate, beginning with smaller things first. We will suppose therefore <hi>a great number of Holy-days,</hi> wherein men shall be restrained from working in their honest vocations; and that the exercise of their Religion on those days, as it takes up no considerable time, (unless it be in some ludicrous pomps) so to be of that nature that it does not search the Hearts of men at all, nor ingraft the Fear of God in them, nor really mortify them from the lusts of the Flesh; they being onely spectatours of dumb shows, as it were, and hearers of a publick Service they understand not one syllable of; and when this is done, think they have done enough, and, it may be, doe not that neither, nor any Secular work upon pain of the high displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Church, but may be more securely found in a Tavern, Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house or Baudy-house, then working on their Trades.</p>

Wherefore I demand, concerning men of unmortified minds, who have no opportunity of being fore-armed against the assaults of the Flesh by a searching and intelligible Service of God in publick, or a Soul-convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Ministry, but necessitated to be idle; what these men can fall more naturally into then tippling and drinking and excess, which joyned with this imposed Idleness must needs carry them to such acts of Filthinesse as opportunity will offer them. It is a known Aphorism, That Idleness is the Mother of Naughtiness.</p>

And therefore <hi>the numerosity of Festivals,</hi> joyn'd with a dead and spiritless Form of Religious Worship, where the Assistants are but as it were the Spectatours of a dumb show, as I said before, what can this be but the School of Leudness and the Nurse of Impuritie?</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Again, Suppose an Order of men, and that Numerous, that feed and fare deliciously, eat and drink of the best, ever Idle, and living onely of other mens labours, that are neither in pursuit of more subtile and bewitching Studies of Philosophy and noble Theory, to carry away the redundance of their Strength and to exhaust their Spirits, nor any searching and consuming pangs of Devotion; but onely patter over their Offices and set Prayers as an external duty, in which, if they be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, there may be little that will so affect the Mind as to maim the Body at all; suppose, I say, these men, notwithstanding their ability and fitness for the functions of Virility, should by an irrevocable Vow (taken rashly and indiscreetly, contrary not onely to the Law of God, but to that of their own Nature and Complexion) be condemned to perpetual <hi>Coelibate:</hi> what can be the natural event thereof but frequent <hi>Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> or <hi>Adulteries,</hi> or foul Acts of <hi>Sodomie?</hi> Wherefore <hi>Monks,</hi> or <hi>Priests,</hi> or be they what they will that are tied to this Law in these cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, cannot fail (unless by a Miracle) to attempt at least the transgressing, if they do not frequently <hi>de facto</hi> transgress, the Laws of God or Nature, and fill the Christian world with the unsavoury reek and fume of their Filthinesses. And it is likely they might find their game the more easily amongst the female Votaries, if they were supposed also without consulting their own Tempers to have offered themselves, or else by the circumventions and importunities of others to have been contrived into Monasteries.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. But imagine these were more recluse, yet the World is wide enough; and if that be true that is so commonly said, <hi>Casta est quam nemo rogavit,</hi> they being so well furnished, and having so little to doe but to study such artifices, it will not be hard for them to compass their prize. Nay they need not study opportunities, they being offered to them in some parts of their Religious Function, as in the privacy of <hi>Auricular Confession.</hi> So strong would Temptation be, though the power of Conscience and the fear of Punishment were yet entire.</p>

But if this will not be so fully apprehended or firmly believed, we will suppose still more Cordials behind, and higher Provocatives to Lust: Such <hi>large Indulgences,</hi> such easy Rates for <hi>Dispensations</hi> and Absolutions, from that unholy High-priest we have so often mentioned, not onely for <hi>simple Fornication</hi> and <hi>Adultery,</hi> but for <hi>Rapes</hi> upon Virgins, for the <hi>grossest Incest,</hi> for lying with ones Neece, nay with his Sister or own Mother; that no man could be much dismay'd at the foulest acts of Filthiness, when he has once considered at what a small value that infallible Judge of Controversies has rated them; nor abstain from indulging to himself any pleasing lust, being so much countenanced and so well encouraged by this indulgent Father Oecumenical or Catholick <hi>Mitio</hi> of the Church.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. <hi>Slight Penances</hi> also would be another great Animation to this Sin of <hi>Uncleanness.</hi> As if so be some small Alms, or a few Prayers repeated so many times over, or going round the Stairs of a Market-Cross, or a little Fasting, or the like, would be a compensation for such foul mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages in a Lay-man, and some two or three months exclusion from the Church for a Priest, though taken in the Act of Adultery.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. But we may imagine yet further artifices of debauching the world without bidding them in express terms to be naught. As if, for example, a considerable part of the year, suppose a twelfth or sixth part, were so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly set apart for one continual Festival of wild Frolicks and Revel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, it being permitted for so long time together under masks and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards to commit any villanies or outrages that the lasciviency of their own lawless phancy shall suggest; as if, because their faces are hid from men, their persons and actions were also concealed from God: Were not this a mere method of fleshing men in leudness and wickedness, and of instilling into them that vile Principle, <hi>That Vertue and Vice are but empty Names, and that any thing may be done by the permission or connivence of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority?</hi> Nay to suggest in too significant an Hieroglyphick, <hi>That there is no God,</hi> and <hi>That sin would be nothing but for the shame of men?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="9">9. This also would be no small countenance to <hi>Whoredom,</hi> to set an example of that liberty in those who should be more exquisite patterns of Chastity and Continence and Mortification of the Flesh; I mean the <hi>Priests,</hi> who are the most immediate Guides of the people. If therefore in process of time the corruption of this Church came to that height, that these Holy anointed men of God might, by the allowance of the Laws of their High-priest, have their <hi>Concubines</hi> to solace themselves with, which, not being <hi>Wives,</hi> come as near to the condition of <hi>Harlots</hi> as four penies to a groat; would not this be a great stumbling-block in the eyes of the People, both Males and Females, to cause them to sin, they seeing him that is their immediate Guide to Heaven so boldly to take along with him an <hi>allowed Whore</hi> for his intimate companion? For Christian Religion admits of no such thing as a <hi>Concubine.</hi> Every one is to be
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:42932:88"/>
the Husband of one Wife, but not any the Husband of a Concubine; that sounds against common sense.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. Wherefore every young man in the Parish having so Authentick an example of <hi>Fornication</hi> in his ghostly Guide, who is so Sacred a Person that he is not to be touched by any Officer of the Civil Magistrate, who is so Holy as to be deemed a fit Intercessour in the behalf of the people above at the high Altar in the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> the people in the mean time being left behind in the body of the Church, as the <hi>Israelites</hi> at the foot of the Hill when <hi>Moses</hi> went up to speak with God in private on the top of Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> whose <hi>Lips</hi> are so sanctified that they onely (and not the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane <hi>Beards</hi> of the Lay-men) may kiss the <hi>Holy Cup,</hi> nay drink all off, and then wipe the <hi>Chalice</hi> clean when he hath done, lest any drop should be left to quench the thirst of any longing Lay-man or Lay-woman's curiosity; and lastly, whose Breath is so omnipotent, as by the recital of <hi>Five words</hi> to create the Maker and Creatour of all mankind; if so holy and magnificent a person as this, will every youth of the Parish say, (with the young blade in the Comedy) may play such loose pranks with one that is not his Wife; <hi>Ego homuncio hoc non faciam? ego verò illud faciam, ac lubens.</hi> Thus naturally will they be invited and encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by this important example of the Priest, to commit folly in every Village, Town and City in a Kingdom. And so great a scandal will this false Church not stick to give, rather then put herself in a less capacity or probability of being Heir or Executress upon the death of her Priests.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. And for this High-priest himself, he might contribute not a little to this debauchery of Christendom, if under his own nose, I mean in his own See, or Metropolis of the Empire, he should be too favourable and remiss in punishing and repressing the boldness of this Vice; as, if he should suffer known Curtesans to pass the streets with a magnificency of Equip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page equal to the greatest Ladies, courted, and accompanied even at Noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time of the day <hi>(spectante populo)</hi> with Clergie-men of the highest Rank and Degree, without the correcting so gross an enormity: This certainly were a competent advantage and furtherance towards the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the game into Credit.</p>
                        <p>But suppose also his Sanctity should vouchsafe to accept of part of the Gains of these <hi>Nuns of Venus,</hi> to encrease his Revenues thereby; would not that be a further confirmation of the Lawfulness of that sport, and a publick signification to the world, that men need not trouble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves so much to hold out the siege against the importunity of the Lusts of the Flesh, since his Sanctitie's own self has come to fair terms in that point, and will patiently suffer these workers of Impurity to set up shop in numerous companies even in his own Episcopal See, provided they pay but their annuall Tribute, and thereby acknowledge his Sacred High-priestship the Supreme <hi>Sannio</hi> of the City? This were indeed to be <hi>a Persecutour of Marriage, and a Patron of Brothells,</hi> as one speaks well in this case.</p>
                        <p>For what greater Patronage can they desire then his suffrage and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance that is or would be held the <hi>Universal Infallible Judge</hi> in
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:42932:88"/>
Religious causes at least, and whose very Title or Inscription is <hi>Holiness?</hi> And that he does allow them, it is plain, in that he accepts, if not extorts, part of their Gains from them.

Which being supposed in this High-priest, it is consequent thereto that he looks upon this Nundination of <hi>Venus,</hi> I mean the trade of Baudery, not to be wicked, and thereby lets the whole world loose to Debauchery and Leudness.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. Which they would be still the more hastily precipitated and sunk into, if they were surrounded with a multitude of Votes from the inferiour Religious Orders, their impudent actions and unsavoury speeches giving witness generally for the trivialness of this sin, if any at all. For we suppose they make it a sin scarce in any thing but this; That they must confess it to the Priest, (that the Priesthood may have the better hank over the Laiety, and feel their own mis-practices lie more easy upon their minds, by finding others like themselves) must acknowledge his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and stand to his courtesy, in a business wherein I have already described him very civil and humane.</p>
                        <p>We will therefore suppose the generality of the Clergie of this false Church foul and impure in actions, words and behaviour; and, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing may be wanting to the heightning of this <hi>Idea of Antichristianism</hi> in this point we are upon, (and you may, if you will, suppose the same in others) the High-priest himself as ill, if not worse then any of the rest, for Whoredoms, Adulteries and Incests. Which things cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly must have a wicked influence for the debauching all that part of Christendom that can have any respect for, or owe any homage to, this Sacerdotal Sovereignty.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. Finally, that there may be nothing wanting to fill up the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of this Antichristian Pollution or Impurity we do describe, we will further suppose those Regions and Principalities that border nearest to the See of this Supreme Priest to be a second <hi>Pentapolis</hi> for the most hainous of all Uncleannesses, I mean <hi>Sodomie</hi> it self.</p>
                        <p>Nay that the High-priests themselves shall be ordinarily so unholy, that they shall be accounted tolerable, if not praise-worthy, provided they content themselves with what ever illicit pleasures they can enjoy from Women, Masculine Venerie being so frequent even in the Heads of this Apostatized Church; and That to be <hi>Pathicks</hi> were the next step to the highest Ecclesiastical Preferments, or at least no stop at all thereto; That this foul sin of <hi>Gomorrah</hi> is grown so much in request, that Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastick Princes pride themselves in shewing their wit and eloquence in setting forth the pleasures of that Vice, and precellency of it above any enjoyments from the Female sex, and publish such beastly discourses with security and impunity from the Head of this unholy and unwholesome Synagogue; who notwithstanding would thunder against the breach
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:42932:89"/>
of a <hi>Monastick Vow,</hi> or any Doctrine tending thereto, with fire and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; and it may be suppress any honest Satyr made to disparage the hainousness of that fulsom crime of <hi>Sodomie,</hi> nay dispense with whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies upon small pretences in so execrable a trade of Wickedness.</p>
                        <p n="14">14. And lastly, That partly by the emboldening examples of this high Praesul's Court, and partly by the strong temptations and importunities of a <hi>Monastick</hi> life, (Idleness and ineffectual forms of Devotion leaving the Body utterly unmortified, nay more foul and lustful then in ordinary Secular men; and their secluseness from women permitting them no other way to discharge their filthy burthens then by abusing themselves with Mankind) we will further suppose that this noisom poison has spred it self generally in this false Christendom, and that sundry <hi>Monasteries</hi> would abound with this sin of <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> this impure heat piercing from that mouth of Hell, the High-priest's Palace, to the more cold and Northern climes of his Antichristian Dominion.</p>
                        <p n="15">15. Wherefore the very frame and constitution of this Pseudo-chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Polity being such, as of its own nature is prone to bring forth so foul and poisonous fruits as these, even the fruits of <hi>Sodom</hi> and the apples of <hi>Gomorrah;</hi> and we supposing that it does actually bring forth such fruits, even the uncleanest works of the Flesh, <hi>Fornication, Adultery, Incest,</hi> and <hi>Sodomy</hi> it self in so plentiful a manner: how can we doubt but that this is a considerable Limb of <hi>Antichristianism,</hi> or of <hi>Antichrist</hi> himself, where they are found, I mean this gross impurity so conspicuously oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to the second Branch of the <hi>Divine Life;</hi> and that this Polity thus infected (if that may be said to be <hi>infection</hi> which is but the natural flower or fruit of the intrinsecal constitution of a thing) with these several kinds of Uncleanness, is that very City, <hi>Antichristian</hi> in the highest measure, which is mystically called <hi>Sodom</hi> as well as <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and whose inhabitants <note place="margin">Rev. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                           <hi>Charity is not puffed up</hi> with pride and high-mindedness: <hi>has no pleasure in unrighteousness</hi> or deceitfulness, but <hi>rejoyceth in truth</hi> and faithfulness. <hi>Charity does not easily think evil of men,</hi> or <hi>unseemly behave her self</hi> out of the bad opinion she conceives of them in matters of Morality or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. <hi>Charity</hi> is so far from exciting others to war, that <hi>she is hardly provoked</hi> to anger, but is patient and long-suffering; so far from perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting and murthering the good, that she will not be over-severe to those that are no better then they should be. For <hi>Charity beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things;</hi> so far is she from persecuting, imprisoning, from racking and killing of innocent and good men (that are endued with the true fear of God) upon worldly Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies and Suspicions, that is to say, for fear the spreading of the Truth of the Gospel should bear down their usurped Empire of Idolatrous Tyranny and Superstition.</p>

4. Having therefore so clear a view of the nature and properties of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> and of the condition of the <hi>Reign of Christ</hi> in his Church, whose Dominion is founded in the Law of Love; it will not be hard to draw the picture of an <hi>Antichristian Polity</hi> so far forth as it is opposite to this last Branch of the <hi>Divine Life,</hi> which is that transcendent Grace of <hi>Charity.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Let us suppose therefore a company of men that pretend to succeed Christ and his Apostles (who if they be his legitimate Successours, they should succeed him also in the Graces of his Spirit) to be quite contrary, in the administration of the affairs of the Church, to that Description of the <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> out of the Prophets and Psalms; would not this of a truth prove a most palpable and remarkable Limb of <hi>Antichristianism?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">5. As suppose first, for example, Whereas our Saviour Christ is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed as one that <hi>does redeem the souls of the poor and needy from op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression and wrong;</hi> if the Frame of this Polity that his pretended Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours set up in the World were a yoke upon the most simple-meaning people greater then that of <hi>Judaism,</hi> and a servitude and bondage more intolerable then that of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> as I have above described it, as both bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening and afflicting their Consciences, and also wearying their Bodies, and <note place="margin">Book I. ch. 19, 20, 21, 22.</note> emptying their Purses by mulcts for such offences as are neither against the Law of God nor any duty we any way owe to our Neighbour, but onely against such Superstitious Institutes as were made by the Ignorance of some and the cunning Craft of others, who multiply unnecessary Laws, that they may enjoy the sweet of the Penalties, and suck away the bloud and sustenance of the poor labouring-man, as often as they catch him in these nets: were not this point-blank contrary to that part of the Descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>Kingdom</hi> that consists in the <hi>protecting and easing of the poor and oppressed?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">6. It were a very unchristian thing, and a shreud sign that those were not the true and genuine Successours of Christ, that did not prevail so much upon the Civil Government, that vassalage and slavery and squallid and deplorable poverty should be chased away, for the glory of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, and the honour of the Kingdom of Christ, which is supposed to be where-ever the Gospel is received: But for these pretended hypocritical Successors to be Instruments and Assistants to the enslaving of the World, for the partaking of the spoil, or rather to erect a Spiritual Polity to enslave all, and bring the most insupportable Servitude of Body, Soul and Estate, such as Paganism could scarce ever shew the like, certainly this must be very highly <hi>Antichristian.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For indeed what can be more salvagely oppressive in reference to the very Estates of men, then to frame such a Religion, upon the pretence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of their <hi>Infallibility,</hi> as is perfectly repugnant to the plain Word of God and immutable Rules of Reason; depraving of things so for their own worldly advantage, as I have already abundantly set out, to bring in a more ample Revenue to feed the Pride and Luxury of this false Church? And then when they have thus grossly perverted the Truth of God, to declare that they who will not say Amen to their lies and forgeries, have no more right to their own Estates then a Thief or Robber to what he has got by unlawful spoil: and therefore accordingly not onely to hinder them from
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:42932:93"/>
any employments of either profit or credit, but disable them from making of Wills, and their Heirs from inheriting their Estates, and awing them from laying claim to their Patrimonies, lest their Father's Heresie be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed upon them whether they will or no.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. To which Antichristian Barbarities you may adde also the <hi>scornful and cruel Penances</hi> they put upon them that do submit themselves to their Church; making them go in procession in contemptible disguises, or else enjoyning them to march in their shirts, bare foot and bare leg, and to whip their own bodies in the sight of the people as they go along. How unlike, nay how utterly contrary, is this to that Meekness and Sweetness that is described in the Discipline and Government of the Kingdom of Christ? But we need not insist upon these things, we having treated suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently of them already.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. Now upon the second particular, viz. that <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Lowliness</hi> which is also one fruit of <hi>Charity,</hi> and by which the Person and Rule of our Saviour is described in the ancient Prophecies: We have shewn the Antichristian Detestableness of the opposite to this Vertue already in the first Branch of the <hi>Divine Life,</hi> and need adde nothing more thereto.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. The third character of <hi>Charity</hi> is, <hi>her delighting in true and faithful dealing amongst men.</hi> The opposites to which are easily discoverable. To say nothing therefore of the manifold <hi>Frauds</hi> which we have already taken notice of all along in this our Description of <hi>Antichristianism,</hi> this certainly must be very Antichristian and uncharitable, namely, To mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>represent mens Actions and Opinions in publick Speeches or Writings, nay to invent notorious lies and fictions to the disparagement of mens Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and Doctrines, and suborn men to write them, and divulge them to the world for truths. Which is to doe so as was the custom of those who were under the Dragon, that old Serpent and false accuser of the ancient primitive Christians, whom they aspersed and calumniated as <hi>worshippers of the Sun,</hi> because they put up their prayers with their faces towards the East; as <hi>Man-sacrificers,</hi> and as <hi>Eaters and Drinkers of humane flesh and bloud,</hi> because of their calling the Eucharistick Bread and Wine the Body and Bloud of Christ, they understanding it onely in a mystical or symbolical sense. For professing with S. <hi>Paul, There is neither Male nor Female in Christ,</hi> but that both have equal admission into his eternal Kingdom, That <hi>they had no regard of Sexes,</hi> but were vile <hi>Sodomites</hi> and abusers of themselves with Mankind. For meeting together to serve God in private in Grotts and Caves of the Earth for fear of persecution, That they were <hi>Conspirators against the Roman State and Empire.</hi> And lastly, for their reverently receiving the Elements of Bread and Wine at their holy Communions, That they were <hi>Worshippers of Ceres and Bacchus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="10">10. In like manner we may imagine that this Pseudo-christian Church may raise such perverse Calumnies against the true members of Christ: as namely traducing them for <hi>Atheists,</hi> or at least <hi>Arrians,</hi> because they will not acknowledge the <hi>Divinity of a consecrated piece of Bread;</hi> reporting them as <hi>Manichees,</hi> because they do not hold the power of the Church to be superiour to that of Emperours and Kings, (to make thereby but one Sovereignty in the Church) but affirm the Secular Power independent
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:42932:93"/>
thereon; as if the holding these two distinct Powers were, forsooth, the holding the two Principles of the <hi>Manichees;</hi> defaming them for <hi>Beesone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riders</hi> or <hi>Witches,</hi> because they have by reason of hard persecution been driven to inhabit desert and mountainous places; or upon their meeting more privately in houses by night, to impute to them some such horrid and villainous practices as were reported of the primitive Christians, that the Candle being put out they committed Incest and all manner of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness in the dark, nay that they killed their own children in these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed Assemblies of theirs. To accuse them of <hi>reviling the Saints,</hi> merely upon their professing it unlawful to invoke them; or of <hi>blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the Blessed Virgin,</hi> because they hold it unfit to worship her. To tax them of <hi>disobedience to the Magistrate,</hi> onely because of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting in the sincere profession of that Faith that is consonant to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Christ and his Apostles. And, lastly, to father upon them what abominable actions they please, and, speaking without a Metaphor, to gag the mouths of the thus accused and slandered, that they may not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer for themselves to clear themselves in the audience of the people: Nay to rack men till their very bowels break out of their belly, to force them to acknowledge themselves or their party guilty of such villainous crimes as it is incredible their very persecutors should in good earnest suspect them of, merely to get a pretence from such an extorted Confession to verifie their wicked Slanders to the world, and to make the harmless and innocent professors of the Truth of the Gospel to be odious and hateful in the eyes of all men.</p>
                        <p>Certainly, if this be not diametrically opposite to that part of <hi>Charity</hi> that discovers it self <hi>in true and faithful dealing,</hi> nothing can be excogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated that is so.</p>

The Hypocritical and Schismatical Niceness of this Antichristian Church in forbearing to joyn in any Religious Duty with any member of the truly-Apostolick Body. 8. Their fraudulent purpose in fostering this Schismatical Niceness and Unsociableness.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p n="1">1. BUt we will also take notice of that which will be so usually cast upon the Dissenters from this false Church, that it will be scarce ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted any reproach done to them, but rather civility or justice; and that is, the so freely nick-naming them by the style of <hi>Hereticks</hi> and <hi>Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks.</hi>
                           <pb n="162" facs="tcp:42932:94"/>
Which yet in their own judgment I suppose not to bear so little weight with it, whenas their real estimate is discoverable by their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, they deeming an <hi>Heretick</hi> so odious or contemptible, that he is not worthy of the common privileges of mankind, and of that protection that the Laws of humane Society do afford men; that he shall not have the security of a Promise though confirmed by Oath; Faith not being to be kept with Hereticks. Not to mention here that they have made the penalties of <hi>Heresie</hi> capital. Which how justly, though a man were an <hi>Heretick</hi> in the <hi>matters of Belief,</hi> provided it were not out of Pride and conceitedness, but out of invincible Ignorance, I will not here discuss.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. It will be of greater use to consider what is real <hi>Heresie</hi> or <hi>Schism;</hi> that the sincere and knowing Christian may not be reproached, nor the less skilful affrighted with these Bug-bears. Those that make so great a cry against the hainousness of these sins, their Zeal and Rhetorick would be more usefully placed, if they would be so faithful as to give us a right No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them; otherwise while they pretend to be so industriously de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous of Peace and Unity in the Church, they may but give greater oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of Dissensions and Animosities. For to make more things <hi>Heresies</hi> and <hi>Schisms</hi> then are, is to create more quarrels then there need be. I will acknowledge as soon as any, that <hi>Heresie</hi> and <hi>Schism</hi> are very grievous crimes, even of the deepest dye; but then it must be truly <hi>Heresie</hi> or <hi>Schism,</hi> not what-ever the peevishness, or interest, or prejudice of a domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neering party will be pleased to call so, under the pretence that they are that <hi>One Catholick Church,</hi> from whose Doctrine (be it never so false or corrupt) for one to dissent must be <hi>Heresie,</hi> and to separate from their communion (be their practices never so Idolatrous) <hi>Schism.</hi> No certainly, those high sins of <hi>Heresie</hi> and <hi>Schism</hi> are not against this or that particular Synagogue, be they never so numerous, but against that <hi>ancient and truly Catholick and Apostolick Church;</hi> and he that sins against her <hi>Unity,</hi> sins against his Creed, which has taught us to say, <hi>I believe one Catholick and Apostolick Church.</hi> Which words because they may be abused to the making of the Church look less <hi>Catholick</hi> and <hi>One</hi> then it is, I shall offer an easie resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the sense of them.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. I conceive therefore that the Object of our Belief in this Clause of the Creed are these three Propositions.</p>
                        <p>First, That the Church of God wherein eternal Salvation is to be had is but <hi>One;</hi> that is to say, That a man cannot be saved in any Religion, as some wantonly conceit, but that there is one onely way of Salvation which is revealed to God's true Church, under which all must come before they can be saved.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, That this Church of God is now a <hi>Catholick</hi> Church, not Topical or National, as in the Commonwealth of the Jews, but a Church that is by right to spread over the face of the whole Earth, and is designed so to doe by Providence, as is expressed in several passages of the Prophets. <hi>From the rising of the Sun to the going down of the same, my name shall be great amongst the Gentiles,</hi> &amp;c. as <note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 1.</note> 
                           <hi>Malachie</hi> has fore-told. And <hi>David</hi> in the second Psalm, <hi>Ask of me, and I will give thee the Heathen for thine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="163" facs="tcp:42932:94"/>
Thirdly and lastly, That this <hi>One Catholick Church</hi> is neither to be stretched so wide as to be acknowledged there where the Apostolical Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, the Faith and Practice delivered and commanded by Christ or his Apostles is oppugned and contradicted, and quite contrary. Doctrines and Practices brought in; nor to be made so narrow, as that such companies of men should not be allowed to be part of this <hi>Catholick</hi> Church, amongst whom notwithstanding the Apostolical Doctrines do obtain, and Primitive Practices of the Church set on foot by the Apostles or Christ himself are in use: That is to say, The adequate Character of this <hi>One Catholick Church</hi> is, that it rejects nothing of the Apostolical Doctrines and imitable Usages which were commanded by Christ or by his Apostles to the Church, nor teaches or institutes any thing that is point-blank opposite thereto, or to the Word of God to which Christ and his Apostles give testimony.</p>
                        <p>That therefore is the <hi>true Catholick Church</hi> in the whole, and in every particular company of it, which has for its visible Laws and Usages, whereby it self becomes also visible, the Laws and Usages of Christ and his Apostles, and nothing contradictorious thereunto.</p>
                        <p>This, I hope, will be acknowledged by all men the most easie and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine sense of this Article of the Christian Creed that the words are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. And hence I think a man may easily discover what that <hi>Heresie</hi> is that is justly to be deemed so hainous a sin, namely, That it is <hi>A Dissent from the Catholick Church even in those things that are in it Apostolical.</hi> For by them alone, they being entire and uncontradicted in her, does she discover her self to be that <hi>One and onely Catholick Church of Christ.</hi> And this would be an hainous sin indeed against that Authority she has to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct and imbue the world with this saving truth; I say, to dissent from any part of this Apostolick Doctrine out of a spirit of contradiction and self-conceitedness, would be <hi>Heresie</hi> in the most loathsom circumstances that can be imagined.</p>
                        <p>And the next degree to this would be the dissenting from the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church in such things as they generally agree in, though they be not expressly any part of the Apostolick Doctrine, but in the mean time not plainly dissonant to the Word of God nor to the immutable Notions of humane Understanding.</p>
                        <p>And the third and last degree is, to dissent from the determinations of a mans own particular National Church in the like circumstances with the former.</p>
                        <p>These seem to have something an over-near affinity with what we have defined most properly &amp; primarily to be <hi>Heresie.</hi> But considering that even Oecumenical Councils themselves may erre, and that Scripture in things necessary to Salvation is sufficiently plain, and the Affairs and the Genius of particular Nations exceeding different and changeable, and General Councils very hardly and slowly to be congregated; I must not be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hasty to call a Dissent here, no not from an Oecumenical Doctrine or Usage, by so harsh a denomination as <hi>Heretical,</hi> there being no entrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made thereby upon the Apostolical Laws and Doctrines. But to
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:42932:95"/>
dissent from, or not to subscribe to the determinations of what Church soever that are plainly repugnant to the Doctrines Apostolical, were not onely not <hi>Heretical,</hi> but <hi>Heroical;</hi> especially if the Dissent is likely to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attended with any personal inconveniences to the Dissenter.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. And now for <hi>Schism,</hi> there is much-what the same judgment to be made hereon. For it is plain that <hi>Schism</hi> truly so called is <hi>A Separation from the Catholick Church,</hi> or from any <hi>National Church which is part thereof, even then when she approves her self to be Catholick,</hi> that is to say, <hi>even then when she is Apostolick, or though she be Apostolick, and offer no Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and Usages but such as are conformable to the Usages and Doctrines of Christ and his Apostles.</hi> To separate from the Church in such circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances as these, I confess were a great and damnable sin. But for one to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from the Church in other things upon an invincible suspicion that the consenting to or doing this or that were sinful and displeasing to God, (though those Opinions might be true, and Practices harmless in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves) this I conceive though it make a man <hi>materially a Schismatick,</hi> yet he is not <hi>formally</hi> so, and he is rather to be pitied then reproached.</p>
                        <p>But if he separate from that part of the Church (if it can be still a part of the Church that does so) which imposes Opinions and Practices plainly repugnant to the Precepts of Christ and his Apostles; Separation in this case need not be pitied, nor ought to be reproached, but highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended and applauded. And that voice will warrant them that calls for such sober Separatists, <hi>Come out of her, my people, lest you partake of her</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Rev. 18.</note> 
                           <hi>sins and of her plagues.</hi> For the <hi>coming out</hi> here would be really the going in to the true Church, and the standing still, the abiding disjoyn'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from; as one speaks very smartly and truly, <hi>Is Ecclesiae non jungitur qui ab Evangelio separatur.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">6. Wherefore from this true and determinate apprehension of things it is manifest how outrageously and Antichristianly uncharitable this false Church would be against the true Members of Christ, in calling them <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks</hi> and <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> and Renders and Tearers in pieces of the Unity of the Church; whenas in truth they are so far from being <hi>Hereticks,</hi> that they are the faithful Witnesses of <hi>Jesus,</hi> and the onely sincere Members of the Apostolick Body, and keep to that one foundation of which Christ is the chief corner-stone, and are so far from being <hi>Schismaticks</hi> in their separation from such a Church as I have described, where gross Idolatry and Superstition has overflown all, that by separating they have redeemed themselves out of this <hi>Babylonish</hi> or <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Captivity, and returned to that City that is at unity or one with it self, and must never vary, I mean, that <hi>one and onely true Catholick Church,</hi> as being truly <hi>Apostolick.</hi> For if it be true, <hi>That he is not joyned to the Church that is separate from the Gospel;</hi> I think it will be true also, that he that is sincerely joyned to the Gospel cannot be separate from the Church. And therefore this noise of tearing and rending the Church, is but a clamorous Accusation of men that feel their own usurped Power and Interest to shake, as if it would break in sunder at this resurrection of the true Apostolick Church, and Christ's recovering the Power into his own hands for the raising that promised and long-expected Kingdom of Righteousness upon Earth.</p>
                        <p n="7">
                           <pb n="165" facs="tcp:42932:95"/>
7. And yet, in the fourth place, though this false Church be thus perfectly Antichristian, as I have described, grossely Idolatrous, and wretchedly Superstitious, and thus shrilly clamorous and querimonious against the rending of the Unity of the Catholick Church, as she will phrase it, notwithstanding all this, we will suppose her so Hypocritically nice and scrupulous, that she will not contaminate herself with joyning in Divine Service with those of the true and Apostolick Church, though there be nothing in their Service but what is Apostolical; no not so much as joyn in the Lord's Prayer, or giving of thanks at meat, nor say Amen to the shortest Ejaculation or Doxologie that occasion should put into the mouth of those that appertain to the Apostolick Body, nor say Grace themselves, for fear these Apostolicks should joyn with them, or adde their Amen.</p>
                        <p>And yet, forsooth, this Synagogue of Deceivers is so zealous and industrious for the keeping up of the <hi>Unity of the Catholick Church</hi> as passes, when in the mean time they are so full of rancour and railing against these <hi>Hereticks,</hi> as they call them, that they will style them (and indeed any Church besides their own) the Church of the Devil; and pronounce that God is not God, if he do not damn them; and will forbid their Nurselings to so much as wish a <hi>Requiem</hi> for their Souls when they are departed this life.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. But this is but an Histrionical swaggering in comparison. Their Devillish <hi>Fraud</hi> in the pursuance of this Unsociableness in any Divine duty, betwixt them whom they please to term <hi>Hereticks</hi> and those of their own Church, is conspicuous; viz. for fear commerce in religious matters should give them the knowledge of the Truth, who are held to this false Church by nothing but by believing of Lies: I mean not onely such as were long agoe framed for the advantage of their Church, but such misinterpretations and falsehoods as they possess their Nurselings with against those whom they call <hi>Hereticks;</hi> whose Doctrines they falsify, and traduce their carriage as they please, and by this interdicting converse with them, keep them in that vile opinion of them which they have infused by their base Calumnies.</p>
                        <p>Besides that, by this scrupulosity in communicating with them in any Religious duty, they ostentate the great Sanctity of their own Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risaical Church, as I intimated before, and ingender an hatred and detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all that are opposite: which plots and practices in those who talk so much for Peace and Unity in the Church is a double iniquity, and the highest breach of <hi>Charity</hi> that comes not yet to blows. But she was certainly the <hi>Whore</hi> that called so remorslesly for the dividing of the Child, not the genuine Mother. And that must be an <hi>Adulterate</hi> Church most assuredly, that would have Christians differ wherein they profess themselves all agreed, and clove in sunder wherein they would naturally joyn together, and that is in the <hi>Apostolical Doctrines and Practices.</hi>

Their Butcherly Cruelty to the Sheep of Christ's Fold. 3. Instances of prodigious Barbarities upon them for their very faithfulness to their Saviour and Redeemer. 4. The numerousness of them that thus suffer, with some particular kinds of Cruelty. 5. More Instances of this Diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Barbarity. 6. All the Elements made Instruments of the wrath and fury of this Antichristian Power. 7. Most beastly and unnatural Examples of this Antichristian Salvageness.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p n="1">1. BUT there are yet behind more palpable discoveries of this Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian contrariety to that Divine Vertue of <hi>Charity,</hi> the Royal Law, as I have already said, of the Kingdom of Christ, which is described from the Peace and Security of them that live under it, <hi>That there shall none destroy in God's holy Mountain.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the fifth place therefore, How plainly <hi>Antichristian</hi> would it be in them who pretend to be in a special manner the Successours of Christ, if they should prove Incendiaries to War, and busy Engineers of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction in Christendom, witty in Cruelty and Revenge, barbarous in Execution; merciless to the poor, hating them even for their Poverty sake; poisoners of Princes, even by that Bread wherewith they would pretend to feed their Souls to everlasting life; and the High-priests them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, the Heads of this Antichristian Polity, either the Contrivers or Applauders of such villainous Poisonings and Murthers?</p>
                        <p n="2">2. But sixthly and lastly, The cruel and bloudy Persecution of the true and living Members of the Kingdom of Christ, for their faithfull adhering to the plain and undoubted Commands of their Heavenly Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, who is styled <hi>King of Kings</hi> and <hi>Lord of Lords,</hi> this certainly must be the most signal and capital <hi>Antichristianism</hi> that any Polity can be corrupted with, and the most grossely and visibly opposite both to the nature of <hi>Charity,</hi> which <hi>beareth all things</hi> and <hi>endureth all things,</hi> which will not be over-severe to the wicked, much less cruel to the good; and also to the Description of Christ's Government, who is said to <hi>redeem the Souls of the needy from deceit and violence,</hi> and that <hi>their bloud is</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Psalm 72.</note>

                           <hi>his Lambs with his arme, and carry them in his bosome.</hi> This is the genuine spirit of the true Christian Pastours, whether of high or low degree, to be thus tenderly affected towards their Sheep.</p>
                        <p>But such as thwack them and beat them, and violently drive them, in stead of leading them by an Evangelical call and going before them in a way of Christian Example, these are not <hi>Shepherds,</hi> but <hi>Butchers,</hi> and will easily drive them to the Shambles, and see their throats cut without remorse.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Persecution therefore of the Saints of God, even for those things they approve themselves to be Saints in, as <hi>in refusing to worship Images,</hi>

                           <hi>or to commit any other act of Idolatry, in plainly and simply professing the truth of the Gospel, and living according thereto, conscienciously abstaining from all such things as it has declared unlawfull;</hi> This is as manifest a <hi>Limb of Antichristianism</hi> as any can be exhibited to our view; and were indeed notoriously Antichristian, though it proceeded no further then to a partial loss of goods, Imprisonment, and Death without any further odious and aggravating circumstances.</p>

                           <q>But to be stripped stark naked of all a man has to perfect beggery; not to be committed to a common Prison, but to be thrust into some lonesome and loathsome cell or Dungeon, upon moist straw or flags, stinking with dung and ordure, or else without this Tapestry, the floor of it self being soft and miry enough, that they may seem to need to pillow, and it may be so streight that they scarce have room enough to lie at their length.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>And then for their manner of Death, when they are called unto it, how unjust and barbarous were it, to have their Integrity and Sincerity to their Saviour to be reckoned a crime more capital then Theft and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and therefore be punished with a severe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Not sparing the Women big with child, no nor the Child that has been bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized with fire as soon as born into the world, but being mercifully transmitted out of the burst womb through the flames, (as untouched almost as the three Children in the fiery furnace) has been cast again into that consuming Element by the cruel hands of the abhorred Hang-man; setting less by the poor innocent Infant of an Heretick, then by the litter of a Bitch or young Kitlings, to whom none will be so bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous as to burn them in the <hi>Fire,</hi> but commit them rather to the mercies of that more soft and gentle Element of <hi>Water.</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. <q>What shall we say to the multitudes of those that are thus mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyred, I mean not onely in succession, but at a clap, by thirties, four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scores, and hundreds at a time, either at one common fire-pyle, or else in barns and dwelling-houses; severe Officers with their iron weapons forcing them back as often as the heat and smoak would drive them out to seek cooler aire? What to the racking and excarnificating their bodies, before this last punishment? to the cutting out their Tongues when they are brought to the stake, that they may be in an utter incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of apologizing for themselves, of praising God, or edisying the people?</q>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">5. It were a long business to set before your eyes all the ways that this Antichristian Beast, this Pseudo-christian Polity and falsely-preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

Hierarchy of Christ, might use in wreaking their spleen upon the faithfull witnesses of <hi>Jesus,</hi> the living members of his true Church; what outrages they and their Officers, or Instruments and Adherents, inflamed by the poison of their zeal, may commit upon the harmless Flock of Christ; sparing none of either Sex, no not in the most compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable circumstances; <q>bringing Women, and that of great quality, within three or four days after their delivery out of Child-bed, into an abhorred prison, using them with like cruel hardship they do others; forcing them out of the Straw, as it is called, to tumble on a bed of flags in a raw and noisome Gaol-cabbin; and within a while after stretching them so on the rack, and piercing them so to the bone with the strings they tie their legs and armes, and so shattering all their body, that they leave them more then half dead upon the torture.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Hanging up others even while the Child is coming out of the Wombe: ripping up the Bellies of others, having first nailed down their hands and feet upon some board; and having cut their Children in pieces, stopping their bleeding flesh into the mouths of their Mothers: opening the Wombs of others, and putting their Children of a year or two old into them, and so stifling them in their Mother's bloud: hanging Men up by their privities at their own doors, and Ministers of the Town after the same manner in their Church-porches: scraping the hands, lips and crown of such Priests as are converted to the true profession of the Gospel, with sharp knives or broken pieces of glass: dragging men by their legs, whom they have half killed upon the rack, like a dead dog, or such like piece of Carrion, they being unable to goe themselves, and thought by the Officers unworthy to be carried.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">6. It were an endless task to reckon up all the hardships that frail Mortality is obnoxious to. All the Elements may be made Instruments of the wrath of this Antichristian Power I describe. <q>Besides being burnt therefore, and pitched all over to make the nidour and smoak of the Sacrifice more acceptable to their enraged Cruelty, multitudes may be drown'd in Rivers, men and women, even in their parturiency, being forcibly driven into the stream. Others may be benummed or stifled to death in frosty or smoaky aire, branches of Trees being set on fire at the mouth of the Caverns where they had taken shelter: And lastly, others be buried alive in the Earth, sending out deep groans from under the ground.</q>

                           <q>To be stript stark naked, and to be beat with rods of Iron, is also extreme hard measure; as also to have their armes and legs so pierced with the twisting of cords, as to make deep furrows in the flesh for worms to breed in it, and consume it.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p n="7">7. <q>What shall we say to the flinging of the young Children of Hereticks to be eaten by Hogs, and to the boiling of others alive in Caldrons? to the forcing of Children to be the executioners of their Parents, and the Parents sometimes of their own Children, Mothers being constrained to cast their own Infants into the waters? to the pulling out mens eyes, and cutting off their hands, and so sending them out to grope their way in the wide world? to the flaying some,

roasting others alive, and half killing others on purpose that they may linger long in torturous pains? What to the ripping the bellies of other-some, to take hold of one end of the small guts, to fasten it to a tree, and then force the poor man to goe round, to wind his guts about the tree, to try the length of them? What to the abusing of the bodies of the dead? to the making Candles of their grease, and the selling their fat to the Apothecaries? What to the laying of the bodies of men and women the one upon another in an immodest posture, and to the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out their boys with whips to lash off mens privities as they lie dead in the field?

                           <p>1. A new Scene of Diabolical outrages done to the innocent Flock of Christ. 2. That they are all to be imputed to this Antichristian Synagogue, though not particularly appointed by them. 3.

                        </argument>
                        <p n="1">1. BUT I am weary of figuring out such sad and Tragical scenes of things; <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, the modes of villainie are infinite. There seems nothing more detestable then that cruelty of <hi>Canniballs</hi> that eat mans flesh. <q>But how far short would it fall thereof, if we should suppose that the Instruments and Adherents to this Antichristian power did riot it with the Brains of men, and set upon the table the Dugs of women fried like Tripes; whom they first ravish, and then cut off their breasts with some parcel of those parts which modesty will hardly name?</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>What should we think of stabbing a man on the soles of his feet and at his eares, cutting off his genital parts, frying the wound with the flame of a Candle, for his greater torment, and for stopping the bloud? What of the tearing his nails off with hot pincers, to make him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his Religion, and to reconcile him to this Pseudo-Christian Synagogue? What of spitting naked women through their <hi>pudenda,</hi>
                              <pb n="170" facs="tcp:42932:98"/>
and so carrying them for some space on their shoulders on long poles? What of stripping off the skin of a mans arme and legs in long slices like leathern points, leaving him to starve in this sad condition in prison? What of dragging by the feet at the tail of a Mule through the Streets, the body beating against the Stones, and the people flinging Brick-bats at him as he passes by their doors? What of cramming Gun-powder into the mouths and throats of men, and then setting it on fire to tear their heads in fitters? And what lastly of this beastly and barbarous Cruelty, to pull the eyes of a man out, and to cut off his yard, and thrust it into his mouth, and to expose him thus mangled unto the view of the people two or three days together, and in conclusion to flay him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, and hang the quarters of his skin at the chief windows in the Town?</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Could there be any thing more damnably Antichristian then such outrages as these against the Innocent Lambs of Christ, whom this false and Imperious Church disguizes with the odious name of <hi>Hereticks?</hi> concerning whom they instruct their bloudy Instruments, that they are not worthy to live, nor to die an easy death, nor to have Christian burial; but that their naked bodies are to be exposed to the rage and hunger of greedy swine and dogs.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. And truly, though these Cruelties, all of them which are here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, are not supposed to be appointed particularly by the Ghostly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of this grand Hypocritical Synagogue: yet their Instruments, Agents and Adherents being informed by them that all that are not of this Church are <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and that all <hi>Hereticks</hi> are worse then Dogs, and to be used worse if we have a mind to it, nay that it is meritorious to abuse them thus, and that their tormenting them in this manner, and killing of them with this barbarity, will free themselves from the fire and torments of Purgatory; it is plain that all this Antichristian salvage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and cruelty is to be laid at the door of these Ghostly Fathers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. Which will be still more manifestly their due, if they be supposed to have influence upon the other, not onely by their Antichristian Doctrine, but by the Authentickness of their Example.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. As if, for example, we should frame some such supposition as this, That there were a Court of Judicature set up, for the enquiring after and examining all suspected of Heresy, for the punishing them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly when they are discovered; and that some Holy persons of this Church should be Judges in this Sacred Consistory, this <hi>Holy Inquisition;</hi> but their proceedings for point of Cruelty and Injustice not inferiour to any thing we have yet named: would not this be a sign or watch-word, as it were, to all the Adherents to this Devilish Religion to use the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of it as cruelly as opportunity will permit, or the natural bitterness of their own spirits suggest?</p>
                        <p>Let us imagine therefore a Tribunal, though not so just, yet more severe (or rather more cruel) then that of those Judges of Hell, <hi>Minos</hi> and <hi>Rhadamanthus,</hi> and, that it may be more like theirs, to be in some subterraneous room, (that the cries and groans of the tormented may not pierce the ears of the people) where all things are transacted in that more
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:42932:98"/>
impure light and stench of Links and Torches, held by Assistants and Officers as grim of aspect as the infernal Furies; and that the proceedings of this Court are infinitely more unrighteous then those of Hell, these Holy Judges having unlimited power, any vile person being admitted for a witness against the suspected, and they making no matter whether the accusation be by word of mouth or by tickets cast in before this Sacred Consistory; for without any personal appearance or confronting one another the process is to be framed, without party, without witness, and without other Law then the pleasure of these Spiritual Judges or Infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Spirits.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Now when the suspected or accused have descended into these shades of Death, we will suppose these subterraneous Judges to begin with some terrifying Premonitions and Comminations, mingling some Hypocritical Exhortations and Protestations, as if they would wash their hands clean, as <hi>Pilate</hi> of old, of the innocent bloud they are about to spill.</p>
                        <p>But if the party will not accuse himself by the terrour of these threats, that they may notwithstanding take away his life in such a torturous way as they think fit for <hi>Hereticks,</hi> (yea though he should freely confess that which they will call <hi>Heresy,</hi> yet if he will not betray all of the same opinion that he either knows or suspects) he is presently sentenced to undergoe such Agonies and Trials as these men of Cruelty shall please to adjudge him to.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. <q>Wherefore there is ready at hand the grim Executioner in a black disguise so horrid as makes him look more like a Devil then a man; who seizing upon the sentenced parties, be they men or women, married or virgins, of mean rank or of noble quality, first strips them naked, to satisfy the lustfull eyes of these Holy Leachers: which to the modest Maids and grave Matrons must be a torment worse then Death it self. After this he binds their hands eight or ten times about with Cords; these cruel and lustfull Villains on the Bench com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding him to bind one round harder then another, and then with a smaller line their thumbs, and then to fasten the parties hands and thumbs to a pulley that hangs on a gibbet. After this to hang weights of Iron or Lead at their feet, at first, suppose, about five pound, and to twitch them up by the rope till their Head touches the pulley. In which pitifull posture they are called to and bawled at by these salvage Judges to confess what they would have them. And thus they hang in this exquisite torture a good space of time.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>And if the party will confess nothing, nor betray his friends, the true professours of the Gospel and faithfull Servants of <hi>Jesus,</hi> they let him down indeed, but to hoise him up again with a double weight of Iron at his feet; the salvage Judges commanding the hangman to let the rope goe up and down with many short checks or stops, that the weight of the Iron may rend every joynt of his body one from another. Which intolerable pain if it cause the party to shreek and cry out, (as it must needs) these grim Benchers shall drown the noise with roaring and railing at him, and calling him <hi>Dog</hi> and <hi>Heretick</hi> for so obstinately
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:42932:99"/>
(that is, so faithfully) refusing to betray himself and his friends.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Which if he persist in, they will let him down again, and adde still more weight to his heels, and an higher torment to his whole body; putting this poor member of Christ to these unsupportable tortures for at least two or three hours together; and, it may be, as they shall think fit, some three days after, when his joints are most sore, bring him to suffer the same extremities of torment again, nay repeat it at great distances, if life will endure it, five or six times over.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">6. And this I think were a Cruelty little inferiour to any we have hitherto intimated in all our barbarous Suppositions. But let us adde ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Scene somewhat different; <q>The stripping them as before, but then the binding of their hands behind them, and hanging them at the pulley, together with the girding of their thighs so hard, as also their legs, with strong cords, and forcing the strings, by plugs of wood thrust betwixt, so deep into the flesh, that they reach near the very bone: In which into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable Torment they will keep them two or three hours together.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p n="7">7. <q>Or else, which is more cruel, if it be possible, to gird both thighs, legs and armes with strong small cords, as before, so hard that they sink out of sight into the flesh to the bone; but withall to lay the party along with his face upwards on a great hollow Trough having a cross bar in the midst, with his back resting on that bar, to his unspeakable disease<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; spreading over his mouth and nostrils a fine Lawn, upon which they pouring out water in a small, but high-falling, stream, drive the Lawn into his mouth and down the furthest part of his throat: which can put him in no less agonie then they are that are fetching their last gasp. And what violence is done to him by that softer Engine, I mean the fine Linen when it is twitched out of his mouth, the bloud and water that comes with it doth copiously witness; one would think it brought up the very Entralls with it out of the body.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p n="8">8. And lastly, to make an end, That that Element that is most mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciless may not seem to be forgotten by these wicked Engineers of Cruelty, it were easy to imagine, that they may make use of great Chark-coal-pans <q>of Iron full of hot coals, forcing the Captives feet as near as they please, and basting them with Lard, to make the pain of scalding more exquisite.</q> Which torture can be little less then the roasting men alive at the fire.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. Certainly if the Religious Orders of a Church in a form of Justice, and upon pretence of Piety and Zeal against <hi>Hereticks,</hi> can commit these astonishing outrages and acts of Barbarism against the faithfull Followers of Christ; how can their example fail of being a School of universal Cruelty for their Adherents against all such whom they shall look upon as <hi>Hereticks?</hi> and they are taught all are so that are not of their Church. And therefore the guilt of all these Tragical cruelties which are done upon the true Members of Christ, though not immediately by the Ecclesiasticks themselves, but by military men, whose Instructers and Examples they are, is most righteously laid upon this bloudy Prophet-murthering Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue herself, this cruel and imperious <hi>Harlot drunk with the bloud of the Saints and with the bloud of the Martyrs of Jesus;</hi> as well she may,

                        <p n="4">4.

                        <p>For, to take again a compendious view of what we have more largely exspatiated in, and thereby to give judgement more safely on the whole matter; what Hypothesis can be framed more Antichristian then this? That a pack of men (phansy them as numerous as you please) should hold together under one domineering Head, that would trample upon Princes, and tread upon the necks of Emperours, and kick their Crowns off with his foot, and under pretence of being Successours to Christ and his Apostles, (though Christ told the boasting Jews (who yet were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionably the posterity of <hi>Abraham)</hi> that they were of their Father the Devil, because they did his works) claim notwithstanding an <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of Judgement</hi> and Right of ordering all the affairs of the world in reference to Christ's Spiritual Kingdom; but yet in the mean time in

And therefore every gainful sin, and serviceable to this purpose, shall be made a Law, (though never so point-blank against the Laws of God and Christ) and all those sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred purposes of Christ's coming into the World shall be trode upon for a foot-stool to lift this pack of Impostours into the Throne, that they may the better trample upon all the people of the Earth.</p>
                        <p>That is to say, Whereas Christ, by his Gospel, came to silence <hi>idolatry</hi> throughout the world, these Deceivers, for their own advantage and profit, will set up openly in their Churches as gross <hi>Image-worship</hi> as ever was amongst the Heathen.

And lastly, This <hi>false Prophet</hi> with the rest of his devoted Impostours, to the end that their own lies and misleadings of the people may not be discovered, but withall to the unsufferable reproach of that great and true Prophet the

Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> and the unspeakable injury of his cordial Followers, withhold those lively Oracles delivered by him and his Apostles from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of men, not without gross revilements and disparagements cast upon those Holy Writings: then which nothing can be more outrageous against the <hi>Prophetick Office</hi> of Christ.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Again, Whereas the <hi>Divinity of Christ</hi> is plainly and punctually and of set purpose asserted in Scripture, to assure us of the allowableness of that Religious Worship we doe to him; it being his peculiar Royalty or Prerogative, as being not mere Man, but God; nay his Godhead being ascertain'd to us by that argument of <hi>Adoration</hi> due to him, <hi>Worship him all ye gods:</hi> yet this perfidious Antichristian Hierarchy will not stick to undermine this Prerogative, and, as much as in them lies, to proclaim to the world that he is no more then mere Man; for, as if they had found an allowed instance of <hi>Men-worship</hi> in him, they will give Religious worship to hundreds of Saints as well as to himself. Whereas Christ is described in the Prophets as the <hi>Prince of Peace;</hi> these falsely-pretended Successors of his, or rather the Seed of Satan, who was a man-hater and murtherer from the beginning, will prove themselves Fomenters of dissentions and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions, and causers of embroilments of Nations and Kingdoms in War, upon their politick and pragmatical Machinations for the unjust Interest of their own holy Crew. Whereas Christ was the <hi>Light of the World;</hi> these will study to keep the world in Ignorance, that they may the better tyrannize over them and inslave them. And whereas Christ professed himself to be the <hi>Truth;</hi> these will make it their business to fill the world with Falsities and Lies, so they be but so contrived as is most fit for the holding up their Interest, Pomp and Power in the world.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. And thirdly and lastly, Whereas the chief and most indispensable End of Christ's coming here upon Earth was to enliven the world with that Life which is truly Holy and Divine, wherein are comprised those four Heavenly Graces of <hi>Faith, Humility, Purity</hi> and <hi>Charity;</hi> as for the first, This Pseudo-christian Church, by reason of the multitude of their lying Miracles and gross Legends and falsified Reliques, their incredible Stories of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and shameless Impossibility of <hi>Transsubstantiation,</hi> (all which tend to the Profit and Interest of these Seducers) bring things to such a pass, that if all the counsels of Hell were laid together, they could not invent any thing more destructive of Christian Belief, and more mischievously insinuating that Religion is onely a Fiction found out to inrich the Priest and make him powerful and honourable.</p>
                        <p>And then for <hi>Humility;</hi> Their Supreme Patriarch being so very high, and wrought to that high pitch by such frauds and forgeries, by abetting and countenancing such Treasons, Murthers and Villainies, by raising such Seditions and Confusions in Christendom; and this Sacerdotal Monarchy exercised with that haughtiness and unparallel'd pride, this Supreme Levite so grossly and rudely treading upon the necks of Princes, and making the greatest Emperours his foot-stool in his displeasure, and his <hi>Sedan-men</hi> or <hi>Chair-carriers</hi> when he is at peace with them; and the whole constitution of their Hierarchy, in the several pomps and degrees thereof, being rather a fiery rack of inflaming Ambition to set all mens

                        <p>And then again for <hi>Purity;</hi> For this lofty High-priest to stoop so low as to set his Seal to the allowableness of <hi>Fornication,</hi> by receiving an annual Tribute from the <hi>Whores</hi> of his Metropolis; and to enjoy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </p>
                        <p>And now, lastly, for <hi>Charity:</hi> What can be more contrary thereto, then to interweave into Law or Religion not onely what is naturally unjust, but barbarously cruel; not onely killing those who are innocent, but tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing to death with the most salvage torments even those who are the most dear and faithful members of Christ, and even for that very reason, because they approve themselves to be so; and that which will make the Barbarity of these Successours of the Devil still more odious, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snaring men in the point of that Mystery which was the Pledge of the greatest Love of Christ that could be expressed, and was intended for the most endearing and agglutinating Cement of all those that are called by his Name, that they should upon this very score be united to one another with the sincerest love and affection that is possible? Now therefore that this sacred Pledge of Love and Amity and Unity in the Church, I mean the <hi>Sacramental Body and Bloud of Christ,</hi> (which is a lively Commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of that ineffable Love of his to his Church in laying down his Life for us) should be made the main Engine and Artifice of entrapping, and afterwards of cruelly torturing and butchering, his most faithful Members; what more horrid, more execrable, and more Antichristian Abuse can there be of our Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> or what Hostility against him more damnable or Diabolical?</p>

Can any thing be imagined more <hi>Antichristian</hi> then this, or more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that noble and Divine Spirit of <hi>Charity</hi> and sweet Benignity that was so conspicuous in the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> Christ, who is so frequently in Scripture styled <hi>the Son of man,</hi> as to whom appertains that expected Kingdom of Peace, of holy Love and of Humanity?</p>
                        <p n="9">9. Wherefore from this short draught I think one may discern that I have given a <hi>very true and faithful Idea of that which is real and essential Antichristianism;</hi> and truly I think to the highest pitch imaginable. For to excuse the matter in saying, that this Pseudo-christian Church does not openly deny Christ or his Gospel, does not persecute every one that bears the name of a Christian, and, lastly, does not set up Images to the Deities of the Pagans, <hi>Mars, Venus,</hi> and the rest: to these I briefly answer.</p>
                        <p>To the first, That it were not their Interest to deny the whole Truth of the Gospel; for then their Power and Credit would fail in the world: But it were the Interest of the Church of God they did so; and therefore they are the worst enemies that can be, doing more mischief under the colour of friendship then any declared enemy can. Besides that there are pregnant proofs in the Scripture, that <hi>Antichrist</hi> is to be a Christian in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Profession, not a <hi>Pagan</hi> or any other Alien from the Church.</p>
                        <p>To the second, That their not killing all that are called Christians, shews that their Malice and Cruelty is more exquisitely opposed and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected against Christ, in that their spight is onely against his true and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Members. For those that are spared are not truly Christ's Servants, but this High-priest's vassals, or at least are taken to be so by him, else they could not escape his sury; so that his opposition to Christ is onely more judicious and adequate, not less fierce nor malicious.</p>
                        <p>And to the last, that they worship the Images or Persons, not of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> or <hi>Neptune,</hi> or <hi>Mars,</hi> but of the <hi>Blessed Virgin, S. Peter, S. Paul,</hi> &amp;c. Suppose a mighty Potentate, and as vertuous as mighty, should put out severe Edicts against Adultery and carnal Fornication; and that some guilty of the fact should apologize for themselves to their Prince on this wise, It is true indeed, Great Sir, that we have committed Fornication, but beseech you to take notice of the excusableness or justifiableness of the circumstances. For we are not such gross and course-grain'd Fornicators as defile themselves with any Flesh, but onely such as we have (and that upon high desert) a very great respect for and entire love to, and that the rather for their near Relation to your Highness, namely, your Daughters, Sisters and Neeces, and others that are more near then ordinary. Would not such an Apologie as this enrage the Prince with the greater wrath against their wicked Leudness?</p>
                        <p>How odious then and ridiculous would such a Plea be touching this <hi>Spiritual Fornication</hi> with the nearest Relations and Friends of our Blessed Saviour? Can <hi>Spiritual Adultery,</hi> which is <hi>Idolatry,</hi> committed upon the <hi>Blessed Virgin,</hi> upon <hi>S. John</hi> and others, be more tolerable then upon <hi>Diana, Apollo,</hi> and other Mortals canonized by the Heathen?</p>
                        <p>Nay indeed would not this latter be but onely <hi>simple Fornication,</hi> or <hi>Adultery,</hi> (there being no aversation in such unsanctified persons from
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:42932:103"/>
the receiving of Divine honours) but the former an <hi>execrable Rape,</hi> they committing <hi>Idolatry</hi> or <hi>Spiritual Fornication</hi> against the wills of these Holy Saints they thus blaspheme and abuse?</p>
                        <p>So that I see not the least reason left to doubt but that I have decyphered the <hi>Idea of the most perfect and most detestable Antichristianism</hi> that can be.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. And thus having fully perfected the Draught of the <hi>Idea of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christianism,</hi> I might, according to the method I intimated, make Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation thereof to the state of the Church apostatized thereinto.</p>
                        <p>But because some men are so very hardly brought off to believe that any degeneracy of the Christian Church, so long as they do still formally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess <hi>Jesus</hi> to be the Christ, can amount to the production of that famous and signal <hi>Antichrist</hi> the Prophecies seem to point at, whom they with all peremptoriness contend to be an open Denier of <hi>Jesus,</hi> and as express an Assertor of himself to be the expected <hi>Messias,</hi> no pretended Successor nor Disciple of the true Christ; I think it very convenient, before I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the <hi>Application of my Idea of Antichristianism,</hi> to make a more exquisite search into the <hi>Prophecies,</hi> and thence to demonstrate (as I hope) with unexceptionable evidence, That such an <hi>Antichrist</hi> for the main, as is represented in that <hi>Idea,</hi> is also prefigured or fore-told by the Holy Prophets, that is to say, such an one as, doing such abominable vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainies as I have instanced in, yet professes himself to be Part, nay Chief, of the Body of Christ, which is his Church.</p>
                        <p>For unless I doe this, I know that such is the shuffling disposition of Ignorance and Falshood, that they will think they can evade all by saying, That I have indeed made an operose Description of <hi>A true Idea,</hi> but not of <hi>The true Idea of Antichristianism,</hi> such as my Title pretends to: that is to say, That the Church does indeed very naughtily, and in some sense Antichristianly, in these miscarriages; but it will not amount to the making up <hi>the Antichrist</hi> properly and signally so called, and pointed unto by the Predictions of the Prophets.</p>
                        <p>Which therefore we are necessitated to search into before we goe any further; and are the more easily induced so to doe, the Method being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently natural either way. For the first intended Method was, After this Description of the <hi>Idea of Antichristianism,</hi> to make punctual <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication thereof to the Apostatized condition of the Church;</hi> to discover who is <hi>de facto</hi> that grand <hi>Antichrist;</hi> and <hi>then to apply the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies to the Events,</hi> to shew that they also do indigitate the same that my <hi>Idea</hi> does discover. My present purposed Method is, <hi>After this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of the Idea of Antichristianism, to make search into the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies;</hi> to find out that their prefigurations of <hi>Antichrist</hi> are in the main strokes (for neither are the <hi>Prophecies</hi> concerning Christ predictions of all his particular actions) most manifestly answerable to the <hi>Idea</hi> we have given, and that the <hi>Antichristianism</hi> which they foretell of is a <hi>Degeneracy</hi> or <hi>Apostasy of the Church still formally professing Christianity,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly as we have described things in our <hi>Idea:</hi> and then, in the last place, <hi>to make a more punctual Application of our Idea of Antichristianism,</hi> thus justified by the agreeableness it hath with the Prophetick Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:42932:103"/>
                           <hi>unto the Apostatized state of the Church for so many Ages to our own times.</hi> Which will be a more plenarie eviction of the stupendious veracity of the <hi>Prophecies.</hi> And it is as good and natural a method to prove the <hi>Truth of the Prophecies</hi> by the <hi>Fulness of the Events,</hi> as to illustrate the <hi>Nature of the Events</hi> by the <hi>Application of the Prophecies.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But in the mean time there will be a necessity in this present search to have recourse unto <hi>Events,</hi> in some sort or other; for who can explain a <hi>Prophecie</hi> without any recourse to <hi>Events?</hi> But all the History we need to have recourse to being either such as is distinct from any part of this <hi>Idea</hi> we have delineated, (and therefore to be brought into view in the interpreting of such passages as require it) or else being but a general knowledge of those Limbs of <hi>Antichristianism</hi> I have described, of which scarce any are ignorant or unpersuaded of for the main; we may without the least confusion or obscurity (partly by referring to this <hi>Idea</hi> in things that want no proof, and partly by producing History where occasion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires) apply our selves to our intended search into the <hi>Prophecies</hi> for a more full demonstration of the truth of our <hi>Idea of Antichristianism.</hi> Which having finished, we shall make a more punctual <hi>Application</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, for the more undeniably convincing the guilty, and for the clearing the innocent from all such unjust Aspersions.</p>

                     <hi>this Performance I present thee with may lie; it being a Treatise wholy spent upon the</hi> Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Prophecies, <hi>and chiefly of</hi> Daniel <hi>and the</hi> Apocalyps. <hi>For it is over-true that some men look upon such Attempts as very vain and frivolous, having concluded with themselves aforehand that all</hi> Prophecies <hi>are inextricable Aenigms and Riddles, utterly uncapable of any certain Solution. Others, whose Exception were more material if it were true, have a conceit, that the searching into</hi> Prophecies, <hi>especially those of the</hi> Apocalyps <hi>and of</hi> Daniel, <hi>tends to nothing else but Faction and Confusion, to the trouble and dissettlement of the affairs of Christendome, and to the hazard of the subversion of States and Kingdoms, and the ruine and destruction of the Church of Christ. And haply there may be others, who, though they neither deem the obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of these Prophecies invincible, nor the search into them dangerous, nay rather of good use and great consequence, yet are so well satisfied already concerning these things by those worthily-magnified Elucubrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Mr</hi> Joseph Mede, <hi>that they may in all likelihood judge any new Essays herein needless and superfluous. With these three grand Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices I phansy my self incumbred in regard of the Nature of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject I write of: besides what particular Exceptions men may be prone to make against any parts of the Performance it self. But I do not despair of more then fully quitting my self of them all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>For as touching the first, I think there is no man that has the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">That the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies are not invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly obscure, and that it smells of Blasphemie and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneness to pronounce them so.</note> 
                     <hi>fear of God before his eyes but he would be ashamed to stand to any such Assertion, it verging so near upon Prophaneness and Impiety, nay upon open Blasphemie against the Spirit of God, as if he dictated such things to the holy Prophets as are not sense, nor ever to be understood by any reader of them. Can there be any thing more Scoptical against Divine Inspiration then this, or more undermining the very foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Christian Religion? But we need not labour very solicitously in confuting an Errour so universally condemned by all parties that are any thing serious in their Religion. For the obscurest Books of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, I mean those of the</hi> Apocalyps <hi>and</hi> Daniel, <hi>are commented</hi>

                     <hi>upon by Papists, Protestants and Neuters, whereby they have all set to their hands that the Visions are intelligible. But whatsoever</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity <hi>there may be in them, I think my present pains ought to be the more acceptable, in that I have contributed so much to a clear and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain way of interpreting them, laying down such assured Grounds and Rudiments, as if a man carefully observe, and find History applicable within the compass of these Laws, he can no more fail of the right meaning of a</hi> Prophecy, <hi>then he will of the rendring the true sense of a Latine or Greek Author, keeping to the Rules of Grammar and the known Interpretations of Dictionaries.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Which Laws I having kept to my self so strictly and carefully, I dare appeal to all the world, if I have not demonstratively made out the sense of such Visions as I have undertaken to expound. And for my own part I must freely profess, that I found it no such hard thing to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand those Prophecies I have interpreted; and am certainly persuaded, that neither any such greatness of Parts nor Exuberancy of Learning, as Integrity of heart and Unprejudicedness of mind, is requisite to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of these things. For if that Spirit of life be once revived in a man, he will, by virtue of his Regeneration or new Birth, not onely see with his eyes, but feel with his hands the truth of these My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries.</hi> None of the wicked shall understand, but the wise <note place="margin">Dan. 12. 10.</note> shall understand; <hi>namely, as many as apply themselves to the search of such things, who will also in the mean time be so prudent as not to prejudge what they never had yet opportunity carefully to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Now touching the second Surmise,</hi> That the search into <note place="margin">That the greater dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger there is from false &amp; unskilful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of them, the greater value there ought to be upon their labour that search out such as are exact and true.</note> these Prophecies of <hi>Daniel</hi> and the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> tends to nothing but tumult and sedition in Christendom; <hi>it is very rashly and unskilfully spoken. I do not deny but that, as it is said of Philosophy, that a more superficial smattering therein may hazard a mans plunge into Atheism before he be aware; so a slighter inspection into these Prophecies may incline some to a Fanatical unsettledness and a dream of a</hi> Fifth Monarchy <hi>sutable to the carnal Conceitedness of their own temerarious phancy: But as a more full draught of Philosophical knowledge will again wash away that Atheistical foulness out of the Soul; so I doubt not but a more through search into the meaning of these Divine Predictions will make a man of a more sober mind, and root out of his spirit all those vain pretences to Innovation and Schism.</hi>
                     <pb n="187" facs="tcp:42932:106"/>
                     <hi>And therefore the pains that I have spent in a more full and through scrutiny into the meaning of these Prophetick Visions may, I hope, at least deserve mens Pardon, if not challenge their Approbation as their due Reward; sith what tends so much to peace and soberness can not unrightfully seem to challenge the reward of a due Approbation from men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I say then, if by a more careless search there has been framed such meanings of those Prophecies as bear any danger or inconvenience with them, there was the greater necessity that some or other upon a more diligent perusal should dive into the true and genuine sense of them; that that Divine truth which was revealed for the good of the Church, might not by any mistake tend to her detriment and ruine. As certainly such a conceit of the manner of introducing a</hi> Fifth Monarchy <hi>as some have imagined and entertain'd, might cause much trouble and mischief in the affairs of Christendome. The Foundation of which Errour with the evil Sequels thereof the Seventh Consectary of my Joint-Exposition does quite take away; to say nothing of other Passages.

                     <note place="margin">That the laudable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance in interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies is no bar to the useful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of this present Treatise.</note> 
                     <hi>propension in my self to be over-loquacious, yet I shall not altogether neglect it, but briefly answer, First, That if I had only made a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of the most sound and unexceptionable Interpretations of such Prophecies as concerned my</hi> Idea of Antichristianism, <hi>this had been no impertinent performance, but necessary for the proving what I had avowed, namely,</hi> That my <hi>Idea</hi> was a Description of such an Antichristianism <hi>or</hi> Antichrist as is prefigured or foretold in the Holy Scriptures. <hi>Which bare Collection of Interpretations would notwithstanding have had their peculiar usefulness distinct from that of Mr.</hi> Mede, <hi>whose enterprise was to interpret the whole</hi> Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calyps <hi>in order. But in this Collection the Reader would be put to the trouble of perusing only such Prophecies as are for the making good the present point we are upon, and which is of so vast concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Which usefull Compendiousness is a thing very considerable with those that abound not with over-much leisure, and yet would gladly be satisfied in so weighty a Controversy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Again, I have produced and explain'd several Prophecies that Mr.</hi> Mede <hi>never meddled with. Besides that I have made use of none of his Expositions which I have not either rectified or corroborated or</hi>
                     <pb n="190" facs="tcp:42932:108"/>
                     <hi>some way or other improved, as he has done, with very good success, in several Interpretations of others. To say nothing of our full and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Confutation of</hi> Hugo Grotius <hi>in all his Expositions wherein he would undermine and elude the orthodox Protestant sense of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies we make use of in this Treatise.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And lastly, Though I am very loath to have any difference with so excellent an Interpreter as Mr.</hi> Mede, <hi>yet I must ingenuously confess that I cannot but dissent from him in several things which I deem not a little material.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>As first, for example, in his Exposition of the</hi> Beast that was, <note place="margin">The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent from Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> in his Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>the Beast that was, and is not.</hi>
                     </note> and is not. <hi>For of this Beast he saith it might be said in S.</hi> John<hi>'s time,</hi> Et jam olim eam fuisse, necdum tamen natam esse. <hi>With this short account would Mr.</hi> Mede <hi>turn off that Description of him. But I must confess it seems to me impossible that those words should be used with any truth, if restrained or tied to the time when the Vision was exhibited, as if it spoke of his existing or not existing then, and not only of the order of succession of Existence and Non-existence. For the Beast that was to be again under the last Head, was in actual being in S.</hi> John<hi>'s time. Wherefore how harsh must it be to say of it while it is in being, that</hi> it was? <hi>But how plain a contradiction to say it is not, while it is, or that it is not yet born, when it has continued so many ages, and does and is to continue uninterruptedly so many after? Apply this to any particular person still alive and in health and to live many years, will it not grate against common sense to say of him,</hi> he was, and is not, <hi>while he is alive and in being? Besides that</hi> necdum tamen natam esse <hi>does not at all specifie his succession under the eighth King more then the seventh; that being left out in this Interpretation which is the most plainly and most materially signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the Prophecy, namely, That the Beast was to cease to be for a time: Which Intervall of Non-existence immediately was to precede the succession of the Beast under the last Head.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. <hi>The oversight whereof seems to me to put Mr.</hi> Mede <hi>to the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">As also of the seventh King.</note> 
                     <hi>plunge also in his Exposition of the eight Kings, where he glosses upon</hi> Unus est, &amp; alius nondum venit, <hi>after this manner:</hi> Unus Regum seu Dynastarum ordo, putà Caesarum, adhuc superest; sed is quoque sub Caesaribus Christianis ità muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turus, ut quasi alius, sed brevis admodum aevi, dynastes vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deretur; reverâ tamen non alius. <hi>Where</hi> quasi alius <hi>and</hi>

reverâ tamen non alius <hi>I must ingenuously confess seem to me to fall short off, or rather to be quite contrary to, the scope of the Text; this Seventh King being called</hi>

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>on purpose to indicate his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme difference from all that went before him, that he did</hi> toto genere differre, <hi>as being purely Christian, and that the Eighth and six first have a greater cognation one with another then he with any of them: which is according to truth. Nor can the shortness of his Reign (for was not that of the</hi> Decemviri <hi>and</hi> Dictatours <hi>far shorter?) nor his being still</hi> Caesar <hi>make him not an express and distinct King from the rest. For upon this account</hi> the Beast that was, and is not, <hi>will want a proper and distinct Head, at least till the</hi> Pope <hi>perk't up into the</hi> Caesareate; <hi>which will be for some hundreds of years. For the Head of the Empire till</hi> Hildebrand<hi>'s time, or at least Pope</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine <hi>and the two succeeding</hi> Gregories; <hi>were the</hi> Caesars.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. <hi>And lastly, Therefore the said oversight put Mr.</hi> Mede <hi>to the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of there being but seven Heads, though eight Kings, in Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s way.</note> 
                     <hi>puzzle how to make but seven Kings of eight, and upon committing this Paralogism, There are but seven Heads of the Beast, therefore there must be but seven Kings. Whereas if he had considered, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the plain Indication of the Prophecy, that there was a time when the Beast was for a while to cease to be, (which was the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervall when pure Christianity was the Religion of the Empire) and that the seven Heads of the Beast were Heads of Blasphemie or Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry; he might have easily discerned, not onely that there might be eight Kings, though but seven Heads of the Beast, but also that it was necessary it should be so. For when the Beast was not in being, his Head was gone also. But the Empire never yet ceased to be, no not in the Intervall of the Beast's not being, nor could it be then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Sovereignty. Wherefore there is a necessity that there should be eight Kings, though but seven Heads of the Beast. For the Beast in his Non-existence could neither want nor have an Head.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The great serviceable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Authour's Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>the Perdition of the Beast</hi> and of <hi>the burning of the Whore,</hi> for the peace and secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom.</note>

Nor take I any pleasure in having different opinions from others, much less in divulging them, were it not for a common good: as this certainly is, it tending so na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally to the peace and safety of all the Secular Powers of the Empire, and to the vindicating of this holy Book of Visions it self from that</hi>

Now the temporary ceasing of the Beast to be, was onely the Empire's entertaining and maintaining the pure and Apostolick Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity as yet uncontaminate with any Pagan-like Idolatries. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ceasing of it to be for ever, is nothing else but the being cleansed for ever from all Idolatry and Antichristianism.

And yet, if I might profess freely my opinion, were but that heap of wicked stuff cast out and abolished, and all her false Merchandizes every-where interdicted, as they are here in</hi> England, <hi>such a purification as this would undoubtedly fulfill the prediction of the</hi> burning of the Whore of Babylon with fire, <hi>according to the primary sense or scope of these Visions, and the Church and whatsoever is comely and usefull be saved from any farther or severer Castigations; provided they did not Antichristianize</hi>

The ill-spent pains of those Interpreters who endeavour to obscure such Predictions by distorting them to other useless meanings. 4.

That <hi>Barchocab,</hi> if applicable at all to the Text, may be a Type of this famous Antichrist. 6.

That there is much-what the same reason of the slowness of Christians in discovering the <hi>true Antichrist,</hi> as of the Jews in discovering the <hi>true Christ.</hi> 8. That a fraudulent and Hypocritical Opposer of Christ may be as real and considerable an <hi>Antichrist</hi> as an open Enemie; as also S. <hi>John</hi>'s description as easily applicable to him. 9.

Certain Considerations proposed touching the Obscurity of the Prophetick style.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p n="1">1. WE have sufficiently discovered to what a great measure the Church of Christ may degenerate, or rather apostatize, from the Purity of the Gospel into that abhorred condition of <hi>Antichristianism,</hi> and yet retain the external Profession of Christianity; using indeed the Name and History of Christ and his Apostles, but introducing thereupon such a face of Idolatry and Heathenish Superstition and barbarous Cruelty against the true Servants of Christ, that by those whose judgments are more free and piercing, such a state of the Church cannot but be deemed
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:42932:117"/>
rather a <hi>Revival of Paganism</hi> then an uninterrupted Succession of true Christianity in the world; or, to use the softest language that the truth of the thing will admit of, it cannot be judged pure and unadulterate Christianity, but a kind of <hi>Pagano-Christianism,</hi> the <hi>Pagan</hi> Rites, Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries and Superstitions being practised upon <hi>Christian</hi> Objects, and this <hi>Paganism</hi> in this pretended Christianity being maintained with as ferine cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty as <hi>Paganism</hi> it self was in the time of the Heathen Emperours. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains now, according to our proposed Method, to search into the holy Oracles, to find out <hi>Whether such a kind of</hi> Antichristianism <hi>as I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed be not prefigured therein; and Whether so horrible a Mutation in the Church of Christ, which for the general it is apparent</hi> (even in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of all that are not wilfully blind) <hi>has for these many Ages seized upon the Church, was not predicted of old by the Prophets, or Apostles, or by both.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. For it seems to me a wonderfull thing and incredible, That God, who was so carefull and watchfull over the <hi>Church of the Jews,</hi> foretelling their Captivities and Returns out of Captivity, and fore-advertising them in a manner of all their affairs of Importance by the mouths of his Prophets sometimes many hundred years before, should leave the <hi>Church of Christ</hi> for so great a number of Ages <hi>without Ephod and without Teraphim,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Prophets or timely Predictions what things would betide her in the decursion of so long a space as twelve or thirteen hundred years together, to let her be bewildred thus in so endless a Night, and leave her floating upon the waves without any <hi>Cynosura</hi> to stear by. Wherefore I do not doubt but Christ has been so faithfull to his Spouse, that he has left some Oracular Records wherein a man may reade, if he come with unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced eyes, in a very legible Character, the state and condition of the Church, and this grand Apostasy of it, with the most notorious circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances thereunto appertaining; that is to say, He shall find in a manner all those Heads of <hi>Antichristianism</hi> which I have insisted upon, intimated some way or other, and charged upon that Church especially which Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry has found so guilty thereof.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Which thing I being so fully persuaded of in my own judgement, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not without a great measure of grief or indignation reflect upon the misspent pains of some learned Pens, who have endeavoured to pervert all those illustrious Prophecies (whether in <hi>Daniel,</hi> the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> or other places) that do forewarn the people of God of this grand Degeneracy of the Church, unto some other sense and meaning, though never so forced and frivolous, though never so strained and inconsiderable; thereby obscuring both the glorious Providence of God, of whose watchfulness over his Church the true and easy sense of these Prophecies is a most ample witness, as also hindering that benefit which was to accrue to us by the right understanding of these holy Prefigurations and Predictions, which if rightly interpreted would be of wonderfull great virtue for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming of the world and converting of Christendom to that ancient and Apostolick purity as well in Practice as Doctrines from which they have so long time swerved.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore out of a due sense of the Honour of God and the Interest of
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:42932:117"/>
the Kingdom of the Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> I hold it fit to bring into view all those <hi>Prophecies</hi> as well of the Old as New Testament that have been by the Ancients understood of this <hi>Antichristian Apostasy;</hi> and with an unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced freedom and impartiality to unfold the meaning of them. Which I hope I shall doe with that plainness and simplicity of evidence, offering so unforced, so easy and so natural a sense of things and so coherent with undubitable Principles, that there is no man that is not grosly prejudiced but will receive full satisfaction concerning the true meaning of these Divine Oracles.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. I must confess that it is hard to produce any Text of Scripture wherein this Apostatized state of the Church is undoubtedly foretold under the very Name of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> though that Name be found more then once in the Epistles of S. <hi>John,</hi> But though some do, yet I dare not contend that this Antichrist or Antichristianism which I have hitherto described is so clearly pointed at in every one of those places. Not onely <hi>Grotius,</hi> but Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> himself understands those <hi>Antichrists</hi> of the <hi>Pseudo-christs</hi> that our Saviour foretells of in <hi>Matthew,</hi> which should start up before and after the destruction of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> which was the <gap reason="foreign">

This is <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> (saith he) that famous <hi>Antichrist</hi> whom you may have heard of out of <hi>Daniel,</hi> but this is a greater distance off. Wherefore to speak what more pressly concerns you, <hi>Even now there are many Antichrists,</hi> which not <hi>Daniel,</hi> but our Saviour foretold of, <hi>whereby</hi> again <hi>we know it is the last hour;</hi> but I mean not of the Four Kingdoms of <hi>Daniel,</hi> but of the Jewish Commonwealth, according as our Lord has predicted. Or more briefly thus; <hi>My little children, it is the last hour,</hi> that is to say, the last King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Four, namely the <hi>Roman:</hi> and <hi>as you have heard that</hi> that famous <hi>Antichrist</hi> will then come, viz. in that last hour; so also now in the last hour of the Jewish Polity there are many Antichrists, whence we may gather it is the last hour thereof, these many Antichrists, according to prediction, attending this last hour, as that one famous Antichrist that.</p>
                        <p>In some such sense as this, I do confess that that <hi>Antichrist</hi> or <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christianism</hi> which I have hitherto treated of may be by very Name inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated in this Text of Scripture, though I shall quarrel with no man that would interpret it otherwise. <hi>Grotius</hi> expounds this famous <hi>Antichrist,</hi> of whom they might have heard, of <hi>Barchocab.</hi> But there being no
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:42932:118"/>
mention of any one famous Impostour above the rest in our Saviour's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions in <hi>Matthew,</hi> it is very suspicable that this rumour was raised out of the Prophecy of <hi>Daniel</hi> touching that <hi>little mischievous Horn;</hi> which certainly is a Prophetick Figure of that eximious <hi>Antichrist</hi> that was to come.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. The same Author also interprets <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>; of <hi>Barchocab,</hi> and renders it <hi>Quis potest esse major impostor?</hi> and I believe very rightly. For it were a dilute business for the Apostle to describe <hi>Antichrist</hi> onely by the bare denial of <hi>Jesus</hi> his being the Christ, that great King, Priest and Prophet sent of God to whom all Nations should flow. For such Antichrists are all Infidels, which are innumerable. Wherefore such a Denier of Christ is here intimated as by playing the Impostour and by making of himself Christ, or by putting of himself into the place of the true Christ, which is <hi>Jesus,</hi> denies <hi>Jesus</hi> to be the Christ, and so by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying him denies him that sent him, and witnessed of him that he was his beloved Son whom all should hear. Such an Antichrist was <hi>Barchocab</hi> especially, who by making himself the <hi>Messias,</hi> did thereby plainly deny that <hi>Jesus</hi> was he.</p>
                        <p>But as there were eximious Types of Christ amongst the people of the Jews, and such as one and the same Prophecies touch as well as Christ himself; so it is obvious to conceive that there might also <hi>Antichrists</hi> arise among the said people, to whom all things befell in figures, which were Types of the famous Antichrist in the Christian Church, and that one and the same Text might point at both, as it is not hard to conceive that this does.</p>
                        <p>For as for that great Antichrist which I have described in my <hi>Idea of Antichristianism,</hi> it is plain that he puts <hi>Jesus</hi> out of his Kingly, Priestly and Prophetick Office, usurping all that himself, or conferring it upon others, as is there copiously declared. Wherefore he making himself so absolute an Head of the Church, he does <hi>ipso facto</hi> cut off <hi>Jesus</hi> from being Head of the same, and thereby discovers himself to be that notorious Antichrist in Christendom; And by denying that <hi>Jesus</hi> is that Supreme King, Priest and Prophet to whom all are to listen and obey, whose De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees and Words are an immutable Law, he does thereby deny also the Father that sent him, as much as any other Antichrist amongst the Jews can be imagined ever to have done. For which of them was ever said to have professed himself an Atheist?</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Which things duely considered will inable us with ease to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand also the meaning of what is writ in the fourth chapter of this Epistle of S. <hi>John,</hi> where he saith, That <hi>every spirit that confesses that Jesus is the Messias come in the flesh, is of God; and every spirit that does not confess that Jesus is the Messias come in the flesh, is not of God: and this is that spirit of Antichrist which you have heard shall come, and is now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in the World.</hi> The vulgar Latine hath it, <hi>Et hic est Antichristus de quo audîstis quoniam venit, &amp; nunc jam in mundo est.</hi> Which implies they read not <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap> where the futurity of a more notorious Antichrist is not excluded in neither place. In this of S. <hi>John, Grotius</hi> again understands the Impostour <hi>Barchocab;</hi> but the Ancients, even the <hi>Romanists</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, the famous Antichrist of the Fathers, Whence it is confessedly true both from <hi>Grotius</hi> and the <hi>Romanists,</hi> that such a Denier of <hi>Jesus</hi> his being the <hi>Messias</hi> or Christ come in the flesh is understood as is an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postour, and boasts himself to be that Christ, whereby he denies <hi>Jesus</hi> to be him; as I have noted upon the former Text.</p>
                        <p>And the sense of both may be this, namely, That whereas those to whom S. <hi>John</hi> wrote had received a rumour or fame of that eximious Antichrist that was to come into the world in the last time, occasioned (I doubt not) from <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Prophecies of the <hi>little Horn</hi> and of that <hi>King of pride</hi> that would exalt himself above all; the Event of these Prophecies being further off, though at last certainly to come, he fixes their minds upon such Antichrists as were nearer at hand; and though but the Types and Figures of that great Antichrist to come some Ages after, yet of more concernment to them to take notice of: but in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim describes <hi>Antichrist</hi> so, that though it does more palpably point at these Types of the future Antichrist, yet the Description, more narrowly searched into, takes fast hold also on that great Antichrist himself, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as it is implied, that it is one who by way of imposture puts himself into the place of <hi>Jesus,</hi> who is the true Christ, that King, Priest and Prophet appointed by God, to whom all must submit. Which not onely <hi>Barchocab</hi> and such false <hi>Messiasses</hi> in the Jewish Common-wealth have done, but he that has so made himself the Head of the Church as to null the Laws and Doctrines of Christ is deprehended to doe the like also.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. I must confess the Opposition and Intrusion of this <hi>grand Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ</hi> among Christians is more oblique and more subtil then the claim of those <hi>false Messiasses</hi> amongst the Jews: but we are withall to take notice that the Christians <hi>Messias</hi> or <hi>Christ</hi> is more spiritual then what the Jews expected, and therefore it is no wonder that their <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ</hi> be of another nature; not a gross and violent Invader of the Empire of Christ, but a more cunning Impostour and insinuating Hypocrite.</p>
                        <p>Nor are we to marvel that Christendom has been so slow-sighted in discovering this <hi>Antichrist</hi> after he was come; the same thing happening to them that befell the Jews, who could not discern their <hi>Messias</hi> when he daily conversed before their eyes. For both these mistakes arose from a like prejudice and false prenotion of things: the Jews decyphering in their minds such a <hi>Messias</hi> as should conquer Kingdoms for them, and make them a rich and potent people upon Earth; (so crass and external a conceit had they of his Power and Office) and the Christians prefiguring such an <hi>Antichrist</hi> as would cast away the external profession of Christ, and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and professedly oppose him in his Kingdom.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. But fraudulent and hypocritical Opposition is as true and a more mischievous Opposition then that which is open and direct. And he that calls another Lord and King, but professes a power of abrogating his Laws,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:42932:119"/>
and of making what Laws he lists himself, and of forcing this Prince's Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to obey them, this man has really made himself <hi>King.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that takes upon him the power to null the Laws of Christ, and makes new ones of his own for the Rule of Christendom, he in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner makes himself <hi>Christ,</hi> and is a more eminent <hi>Antichrist</hi> then <hi>Barcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cab,</hi> whom <hi>Grotius</hi> would bear us in hand to be the man indigitated by S. <hi>John</hi> in these words, <hi>The Antichrist of whom you have heard that he shall come;</hi> whenas I have already noted that they had no news of any one eminent Antichrist but from the <hi>little Horn</hi> in <hi>Daniel,</hi> and that <hi>King of pride that exalts himself above all that is called God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And truly all those dreadful particularities comprised in the Descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of <hi>Antichrist</hi> in S. <hi>John</hi> will be found in this <hi>Man of sin.</hi> For in making himself <hi>Christ,</hi> which he does interpretatively, he does there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall deny <hi>Jesus</hi> to be him, who is the Giver of a Law indispensable by any Power upon Earth, his Decrees being the Decrees of the Eternal Son of God. Wherefore he that takes upon him the power of contradicting, of nulling and dispensing with these Doctrines and Decrees, does thereby deny that <hi>Jesus</hi> is the Son of God; and he that denies the Son, denies also the Father that sent him.</p>
                        <p>This sense, I think, will appear very plain to any indifferent judgment; and I need not insist any longer thereon, having intimated something to the same purpose before. Onely I will suggest how ordinary it is in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to charge the sinner <hi>directly</hi> with what he perpetrates but <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretatively.</hi> As where God says, the Israelites <hi>did not sacrifice to him in</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Amos 5. 25.</note> 
                           <hi>the wilderness:</hi> which is true onely <hi>interpretatively,</hi> forasmuch as they sacrificed also to other Gods, and so did not sacrifice to <hi>Jehovah</hi> the true <note place="margin">See <hi>Idea Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ,</hi> book 2. chap. 6. sect. 6.</note> God, he being so matchless a Perfection that he is uncapable of any Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival or Co-partner in Religious Worship; which they doing to others, they <hi>interpretatively</hi> disowned <hi>Jehovah</hi> to be what he was, and therefore sacrificed not to him, no not when they pretended it, but to a Figment of their own phancy. So <hi>Jeremie</hi> makes the Jews to say to <hi>a Stock, Thou art my Father, and to a Stone, Thou hast begotten me:</hi> which <hi>Charge</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding <note place="margin">Jer. 2. 27.</note> is onely true <hi>interpretatively,</hi> forasmuch as they did Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Worship to <hi>Stocks</hi> and <hi>Stones,</hi> and thereby acknowledged them to be God, the Father of all Mankind and Creator of the world. And, lastly, in this very Epistle S. <hi>John</hi> says, that <hi>he that denies that Jesus is the Christ, denies both the Father and the Son.</hi> But who ever heard that <hi>Barchocab</hi> or any other Jewish Pseudo-christ directly denied God that was the Father of our Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> Christ? Several like Examples oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in Scripture, which are so obvious that it is needless to produce them. These may serve for a pledge of the reasonableness of our Interpretation.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. But suppose we should give up all for lost in S. <hi>John</hi>'s Epistle, and acknowledge that <hi>this eminent Antichrist,</hi> that has reigned thus long in Christendom, is not pointed at in any place of that Writing; it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, I confess, that this Antichristian Power which we have so amply de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed in our other Treatise is no where in Scripture called <hi>Antichrist;</hi> and so that corrupt High-priest with his apostatizing Clergy will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from the infamy of being branded with that very Name by the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:42932:119"/>
of God himself: but in the mean time I cannot but deem this as ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous a piece of niceness and shieness thus to abhor from names, when the things thereby signified are so conspicuous in the party, as if some Monster of men of twelve cubits stature should conceive a great indignation at the being called <hi>Gigas,</hi> but think himself not at all injured by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation of <hi>Dodecapechys;</hi> whenas a man on this side of twelve cubits stature may fitly and justly be styled <hi>Giant.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But for my own part, I think it was more for <hi>compendium</hi> then for any greater disgracefulness of the Title, that that Person or Body politick which was really become Antichristian was vulgarly called <hi>Antichrist,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then <hi>The Whore of Babylon, The two-horned Beast, The Man of sin,</hi> and the like; which Titles are no less odious, though less compendious. And it is observable that those Texts of Scripture upon which the ancient Fathers have written, <hi>A Prophecie of Antichrist,</hi> let us suppose them to have fetched the Title from whence you will, (though I doubt not but they had it from this Epistle of S. <hi>John)</hi> are to admiration fit and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to those Events we see before our eyes in the <hi>Roman</hi> Hierarchy.</p>
                        <p>If therefore we will stand to the Nomenclature of the Ancients, those <hi>Prophecies</hi> which they interpreted of <hi>Antichrist</hi> being found plainly and undoubtedly to concern that degenerate Body of Christendom, there is all reason that the said Body with the Head thereof should be noted by that more general and compendious Appellation.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. But for the making out that wonderful fitness and applicableness of these <hi>Prophecies,</hi> it is a business more operose and laborious, and will be the more successfully attempted if we prepare the way by some Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations concerning the <hi>Obscurity of the Prophetick style,</hi> especially in <hi>Daniel</hi> and the <hi>Apocalyps;</hi> as namely, <hi>Wherefore this Obscurity is,</hi> and then, <hi>Wherein it consists,</hi> and lastly, <hi>What is the best way to clear and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarize the same unto us.</hi>

and so just. For it is fit that that knowledge that is so far removed above humane capacity should be received with as humble and profound vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which <hi>Obscurity</hi> and <hi>Mysteriousness</hi> conciliates to all Truths, but is most due to them that are the greatest and the most beyond our natural reach, as this of <hi>Prophecy</hi> is. Besides that this <hi>Obscurity</hi> does not a little bridle or oppose that precipitant fervour and heat wherewith men are usually carried to the knowledge of things to come. Which though it fall to the shares of very few to be immediate Receivers of; yet if any one be, all men are ready to throng and croud to him, out of that natural curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity and desire of being instructed concerning future events. Upon which fiery and prurient itch after the knowledge of Futurities Providence has cast this bridle of hard and Aenigmatical uttering of Prophetical Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; as he has the Laws of natural shame and modesty, besides super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>induced Institutes of Religion and humane Policy, upon that impetuous propension of experimenting the pleasures of the Nuptial Bed, that so strong Inclinations may not be gratified without the Ceremony of some te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious attendance and expectation thereof. And it may be that this Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation and hope, being a kind of prelibation of enjoyment, may in both cases lengthen out the pleasure.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. But there is also a great necessity of this <hi>Obscurity</hi> which we have not yet hinted, and that is, That these Divine Predictions concerning the Church of God may not be easily or at all understood by those that are to be the fulfillers of them, till the appointed time come, when it may be without prejudice to the true Church; that is to say, That things are not to be so clearly prefigured as would bear too hard against that free Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in Man whereby he does (unless thus miraculously called to from Heaven) determine his ways according to his own pleasure. For so plain a Divine Prediction as should certainly inform the party that he should doe such an act as would tend to his shame and destruction, or be a badge or mark conspicuous and infallible to all the world that he was that odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous person that so ill a fate must attend; would without all doubt (unless God should use a strong force upon him to make him fulfill the Prophecie) cause him to decline the fulfilling of it merely for his own honour and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, and make him omit any such circumstances as he is prefigured by, to the end that he may deface the characteristicks of his own person in the Prophecie.</p>
                        <p>As for example, If S. <hi>John</hi> had said expresly, that by the <hi>Two-horned Beast</hi> and by <hi>The Whore of Babylon</hi> he did understand a Succession of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of <hi>Rome</hi> with their whole Hierarchy adhering thereunto; it would be an hard thing to conceive that this Oecumenical Prelate would not, to hide his shame, have been tempted to <hi>change</hi> his <hi>Seven-hilled</hi> See, that he might not seem to be the man at whom the Prophecie pointed. At least they would never have wrote <hi>Mysterium</hi> upon the Pope's Crown, as it is on the <hi>Whore of Babylon,</hi> if they had been aware that his Holiness had been so much concerned in that Vision. Nor can we imagine that, if instead of <hi>Six hundred sixty six, Twenty five</hi> had been said to be the <hi>Number of the Beast,</hi> the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would have affected that Number so much as they have. And many more such Instances may be produced.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="213" facs="tcp:42932:120"/>
But God could hardly be said <hi>to leave man in the hand of his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,</hi> and let him act freely according to his own nature, if he should have uttered these Divine Oracles concerning future things in so plain and naked a manner, and yet brought about the fulfilling of them.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Besides this, The knowledge of future things concerning the Church communicated to the Enemies thereof may tend to her prejudice; it being ordinarily unsafe to let an Adversary get intelligence of our consultations and purposes.</p>
                        <p>Which is not onely true in respect of Men, but of those Invisible enemies of the Church, who ever attempt her and oppose her under the conduct of the Prince of the Powers of the aire, who are the great Abettours and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisters of the children of Disobedience. An eximious instance whereof is that taken notice of by Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> out of S. <hi>Austine;</hi> How the Devil (who of old had so much skill in Mathematicks as to puzzle the <hi>Athenians</hi> by the Problem of <hi>doubling the Cube)</hi> computing the proportion betwixt the Outward Court of the Temple and the Inward, which it seems he found to be as 1260 to 365, or thereabout, presently concluded, <hi>That Christianity would continue but</hi> 365 <hi>years in the World,</hi> and that then <hi>Paganism</hi> would up again: And therefore adorning the credit of his own Oracles by this stoln, but misunderstood, Prediction out of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calyps,</hi> gave it out accordingly, that thereby he might hinder mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version to the Faith of Christ. Which I think is argument enough to persuade us how necessary it is that the holy Prophecies should be wrapt up in Aenigmatical coverings, and be made of uncertain Interpretation by undeterminable lubricities, till either Events, or some faithfull Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter more then ordinarily assisted by God, shall give their clear Solution.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Now for the Art of obscuring Predictions wherein it consists; though I will not undertake the declaration of the whole, yet I will bring in as great a share thereof as may, at least, suffice for our present design: which I shall comprise in the Explication of these few <hi>Prophetick Figures</hi> or <hi>Schemes,</hi> which I will venture to call <hi>Diorismus, Hylasmus, Heno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poeia, Zoopoeia, Israelismus, Ellipsis, Metalepsis, Homonymia, Antichro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nismus, Icasmus;</hi> most of which do as well embellish and adorn the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall <hi>Cortex</hi> of Prophecies, as conceal and cover the more precious and inward Sense of them.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. <hi>Diorismus</hi> is such a Scheme of the Prophetick style as polishes the outward letter with an appearing sense of a very exact and determinate account of things either as to <hi>Number, Proportion,</hi> or <hi>Specification.</hi> Which does the more strongly strike the Phancy, as an Object settled and unmoved makes a stronger impress upon the Sight then that which is flit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, as ordinary Experience tells us. So any determinate Conception does more vigourously and palpably affect the Mind then what is more general and undeterminate.</p>
                        <p>An Example of the first kind of this Figure I conceive is that, <hi>Apocal.</hi> 2. <hi>Ye shall have the affliction of ten days.</hi> Where I must confess I could never imagine that spoken otherwise then figuratively by a <hi>Diorismus,</hi> and to be a modest subinsinuation of the most perfect and full persecution,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:42932:121"/>
as is intimated from the following words, <hi>Be thou faithfull unto death,</hi> &amp;c. See <hi>Vatablus</hi> and <hi>Drusius</hi> upon the place, who produces several examples of <hi>Ten</hi> being put for <hi>many.</hi> Which sense if the <hi>Ten</hi> Horns on the Beast be supposed to have, there is no absurdity in admitting that meaning; though I do not condemn their industry that are so solicitous to find just <hi>Ten</hi> and no more. For it may the more potently convince the obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, while others may be satisfied that that condition is onely inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated of the Empire when it was divided into a considerable Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Kingdoms or Principalities enjoying Sovereign Power within themselves.</p>
                        <p>And that the <hi>Hundred fourty four thousand</hi> with the Lamb on Mount <hi>Sion</hi> are not to be conceived just so many or so few, any one will grant that observes that the number 144 is onely the square of 12, and therefore, according to the mode of the ancient <hi>Cabbala,</hi> signifies symbolically the Apostolicalness of that Company, but not their determinate number, no more then 666 the number of them that follow the Beast.</p>
                        <p>I suspect also that those 7000 <hi>names of men</hi> said to be slain in that great Earthquake, <hi>Apocal.</hi> 11. is spoken onely by way of a Prophetick <hi>Diorismus;</hi> but what the genuine sense is I shall take notice in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place.</p>
                        <p>I will cast in a fourth Example; <hi>The</hi> 1260 <hi>Days,</hi> they being but the Diduction of those larger measures of three Times and an half, or of fourty two Months, into more numerous parts, it is not irrational to suspect that it was rather for the varying of the phrase and for the polishing of the external frame of the Prophecy by such a determinate numbering of those times or months into 1260 days, then that it did challenge our expectation to be satisfied to a Prophetick day; one Day in so many, and in matters of so voluminous a transaction, being not considerable and of small use, the <hi>Epocha</hi> also being uncertain from whence the time exactly is to commence. Besides what Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> has hinted, that varying of the time into <hi>Months</hi> and into <hi>Days</hi> respects the works of <hi>Light</hi> and the works of <hi>Darkness:</hi> and therefore their continuance who are under the Principality of Light is reckoned by <hi>Days;</hi> but theirs who are under the Principality of Darkness, the <hi>Moon</hi> being the Governess of the Night, is reckoned by <hi>Months.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Wherefore a man might not without ground imagine that there may be a latitude of reckoning in this solution of the <hi>three Times and an half,</hi> or the 42 Months, into 126 Decads of Days, as well as there is in those Times and Months; and that any variation, above or within, that exceeds not a Decad, breaks no squares; Divine Prophecies being not for the ostentation of God's Omnisciency, (for who knows not but that he can compute Events to the smallest moment of an Hour?) nor yet for the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying of the excess of humane Curiosity, but for the use and exercise of his Church.</p>
                        <p>The Witnesses also lying unburied <hi>three days and a half</hi> is an eximious Example of this Numeral <hi>Diorism;</hi> but the meaning may be the same with <hi>three times and an half,</hi> as I have elsewhere intimated.</p>

also, and to signify merely Symbolically, not Arithmetically. For the continuation of the <hi>Saracenical Kingdom</hi> (I mean of that more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table intervall thereof from the beginning of the <hi>Caliphate</hi> of the <hi>Abasidae</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s <hi>Comment.

                        <p>That Infestation of <hi>Italy</hi> by the <hi>Saracens</hi> from the year 830 to 980 had been more plausible, if it had been commensurate; but it extends be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the year 980. For <hi>anno</hi> 1001 the <hi>Saracens</hi> are expelled <hi>Capua</hi> by <hi>Otho,</hi> and in the next year they besiege <hi>Salernum,</hi> in the year 1008 they are raised from the Siege of <hi>Barium</hi> and <hi>Capua,</hi> in the year 1017 they invade <hi>Italy</hi> again; besides other fights and troubles afterwards. But this is enough to shew, that <hi>five months</hi> of years will not be well appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to their molestation of <hi>Italy</hi> neither, though I think Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> has made things look as handsomely as they are capable of. But the Attempt was as well needless as unsuccessfull. For there is exactly no determinate time intended by these <hi>five months,</hi> but it is onely an elegant <hi>Diorism</hi> respecting the Type, which are <hi>Locusts,</hi> whose continuance in life not reaching to the space of a Year, it was fit, by an <hi>Antichronismus,</hi> to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber by <hi>Months.</hi> And what number fitter then <hi>five?</hi> not onely because it may be a Symbol of incompleteness, (as <hi>Ribera</hi> suggests, and those <hi>Locusts</hi> are said onely to <hi>torment,</hi> not <hi>kill)</hi> but also in respect of the length of their life, which, according to <hi>Plinie, Aristotle</hi> and other Naturalists, is in all likelihood about <hi>five months.</hi> So that the solution of the Mystery of these numbers is not merely into such an <hi>Antichronismus,</hi> where the figurative number will determinate the true, but also into a <hi>Diorismus,</hi> where this accuracy is expressed in the <hi>Cortex,</hi> but not intended in the inward meaning. Which Scheme is here used with a special elegancy by reason of the reflexion it has upon the noted time of the continuance of those Creatures which are the Type.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. But why these kind of <hi>Diorisms</hi> are made use of, and why there is not the same accuracy in the inside of these Prophecies as there is engraven on the outside, is a Problem too curious to enquire into, but not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inextricable with those that are well assured of the <hi>Cabbalistick</hi> style, and also throughly consider how shy Providence is of bearing too hard against that free Principle in Man, by necessarily determining what is more naturally left loose to play of it self, and use its own free Agency.</p>

                        <p n="9">9.

Which has a smack of the <hi>Cabbalistick Genius,</hi> who use <hi>Numbers</hi> for the Symbols of things, as I have already noted. So the <hi>Tenth part</hi> of the City is not the <hi>Tenth</hi> of the City that then was, but of a City whose extent bore but the proportion of a <hi>Tenth</hi> part to what it had been, as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> has carefully computed.</p>
                        <p>To this head you may also refer that <hi>Apoc.</hi> 18. <hi>Double unto her double according to her works,</hi> and <hi>Fill unto her double.</hi> Which is so defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively spoken as if she should be repay'd with as much more as she had injured others; but the sense is onely that she should be pay'd home for all her injurious dealings.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>HYlasmus</hi> is a Prophetick Scheme bearing strongly upon the Phancy by exhibiting crass and palpable Objects, such as in Logick would bear the Notion of <hi>Subject</hi> or <hi>Matter.</hi> The first kind is coincident with <hi>Metonymia Subjecti;</hi> as when <hi>a City</hi> is put for <hi>the Inhabitants,</hi> or <hi>a Temple</hi> for <hi>them that worship therein.</hi> Examples of this kind are frequent every where.</p>
                        <p>To the second kind I would refer such Representations as are from Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Pavements and the like, which are compact of crass and palpable Materials, but are Mystical or Spiritual Symbols of quite another thing. Examples of this kind are the <hi>Inward</hi> and <hi>Outward</hi> Court of the Temple, the one <hi>Symmetral,</hi> the other <hi>Asymmetral;</hi> which signifies the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church, one while in her Purity, another while in her Apostasie to Idols. So the <hi>Holy City troden down by the Gentiles</hi> signifies the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church over-run with Gentilism. So that <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> in this case is an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem of <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> or a Body Politick, as <hi>Temple</hi> may be of the living Church of Christ.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. An eximious Example of this kind of <hi>Hylasmus</hi> is the Description of <hi>Jerusalem, Apoc.</hi> 21. with its high wall and twelve gates, and by a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick <hi>Diorism</hi> the measure of the City is concluded twelve thousand furlongs, and the wall an hundred fourty four cubits; and the Materials are Gold and Pearls and precious Stone. And yet this City so <hi>Hylastically</hi> set out has a most Spiritual meaning, and signifies nothing else but the Church of Christ reduced again to Apostolical Purity.</p>
                        <p>But the most notable Instance of a Prophetick <hi>Hylasmus</hi> is the Descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of the Temple by <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> to which I cannot say but this of S. <hi>John</hi> alludes in several passages: And that it is an <hi>Hylasmus,</hi> and not a literal Description, I think any one will easily grant that does but peruse the 47 Chapter.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, The destruction of the City <hi>Babylon</hi> in the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> is also a remarkable Example of this Scheme: but though in the general it apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to this second kind of <hi>Hylasmus,</hi> yet things are there set out very much by the former kind, which is a <hi>Metonymia Subjecti,</hi> not <hi>continentis,</hi> as before, but <hi>occupantis,</hi> the Objects of their Spiritual Negotiations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so crassly discovered and described.</p>
                        <p n="3">
                           <pb n="218" facs="tcp:42932:123"/>
3. The next Prophetick Scheme is <hi>Henopoeia,</hi> and the most graceful, but withall as much obscuring as any. And the first and chiefest kind thereof is this, The collection of a multitude of Individuals into the show of one Individual, as also of a Succession of Individuals or Multitudes into the show of one standing Individual. This is an ancient method of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering Mysteries, as any one will discern if he throughly perpend the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and truth of the ancient <hi>Cabbala.</hi> Which that both <hi>Daniel</hi> and S. <hi>John,</hi> I may adde S. <hi>Paul</hi> too, have imitated in their Prophecies, I think is easily to be evinced.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Touching the collection of a Multitude into the show or representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one Individual, it is plain in <hi>Daniel;</hi> for one individual <hi>Lion</hi> there denotes the whole Kingdom of the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> one <hi>Bear</hi> the Kingdom <note place="margin">Dan. 7.</note> of the <hi>Medo-Persians,</hi> one <hi>Leopard</hi> the Kingdom of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and the fourth Beast the <hi>Roman</hi> Kingdom. It is true it is said, <hi>The four Beasts are four Kings;</hi> but the vulgar Latin has it, <hi>four Kingdoms,</hi> as also <hi>Theodoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and the Text says expresly, that <hi>the fourth Beast is the fourth King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom upon earth.</hi> So the <hi>Ram</hi> and the <hi>Goat</hi> in the eighth Chapter, (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Grotius</hi> his own Interpretation out of the Hebrew Idiom) though they be said to be <hi>Kings,</hi> are <hi>Kingdoms.</hi> And whereas it is written, <hi>And the rough Goat is the King of Graecia, and the great Horn that is betwixt his eyes is the first King;</hi> unless this <hi>Goat</hi> either signifie a Succession of Kings, or a Kingdom, it is not sense; yea, though Succession, yet it will be very harsh sense to make the <hi>great Horn</hi> the first King, and the Body the rest. Wherefore unless we would distort things beyond all measure, <hi>the Body of the Goat</hi> must signifie the Kingdom of <hi>Graecia,</hi> as the <hi>Horns</hi> the Supreme Power; consonantly to what <hi>Grotius</hi> has written, and I doubt not but his Interpretation is true. And I think that scarce any one can be so weak, but upon the reading of <hi>Daniel</hi> he will be assured that in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick Figurations one individual Beast signifies a Multitude of men or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered together into the Body of a Kingdom.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. But as the <hi>great Horn of the He-goat</hi> is said to be the first King, so the <hi>four Horns</hi> undoubtedly signified four succeeding Kings in this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided Kingdom in their several <hi>series;</hi> so that four Successions of Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals, so far as they would last, were represented under the show of four single Individuals, namely those four Horns. And truly when it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent that one Individual Beast represents the succession of a Multitude for many Ages together, (who are mortal as well as single men) coagmentated into the body of one Kingdom, it were a very nice and humorsome thing to stick at the succession of single Persons being represented under the show of <hi>one Head</hi> or <hi>Horn.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">6. And that one and the same Beast stands for a Kingdom or Empire from its rise to its fall, is plain both in <hi>Daniel</hi> and the <hi>Apocalyps.</hi> For the Four Beasts are said to rise out of the great Sea, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. and the destruction of the Fourth is set down in the same Chapter, who is supposed to tread down the Third, as the Third is after declared to vanquish the Second in the following Chapters. And in the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> the Rise of the Beasts there is set down, as also their destruction in the Lake of fire and brimstone. Whence it is evident that one Individual Beast represents not onely a Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:42932:123"/>
of men under one Government, but the Succession of this multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude for many Ages, even till it cease to be such a Multitude; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the successive Sovereignty of this multitude must be thus far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented (be it in one or many) by the <hi>Head</hi> or <hi>Horns</hi> of such Beasts, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less we can phansy a Polity without an Head, which would not be a Polity, but Anarchy.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Nor are Irrational Creatures onely made <hi>Henopoetick</hi> Types of a Multitude collected into one Government, but also Rational: As it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the <hi>Woman in the Wilderness,</hi> which it were ridiculous to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand of some one single Woman, and not of the Body of the Church, whose true and living Head is Christ <hi>Jesus.</hi> The <hi>Woman</hi> also in <hi>Esdras</hi> signifies <hi>Sion</hi> or the people of God; and it may be the <hi>Man</hi> there <hi>coming out of the Sea</hi> has some such sense. For why may not <hi>one Man</hi> signifie a People or Multitude as well as <hi>one Woman?</hi> And it is plain that the people of <hi>Israel</hi> is called the Son of God, <hi>(Israel my son, my first-born.)</hi> And therefore the <note n="*" place="margin">2 Thess. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                           <hi>Son of perdition</hi> and that <hi>Man of sin</hi> need not signifie one single man or a succession of single men, but a Body Politick under one Head of mischievous contrivances. By the like <hi>Henopoeia</hi> also <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, <hi>the false Prophet,</hi> signifies not one single Person, or the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of such single persons, but a Collection or Body of Deceivers combining together under one Government. These things are so easie and so obvious that I am afraid I shall seem to have insisted over-long upon them.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. I will onely note a second kind of <hi>Henopoeia,</hi> which is also of useful consideration, and that is when things of different natures are comprised under one Type. We have a very warrantable Instance of this way of interpreting Prophecie, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 17. where the Angel does declare that not onely <hi>Seven Kings</hi> but <hi>Seven Hills</hi> are couched under the Symbol of the <hi>Seven Heads</hi> of the Beast. According to this Analogie it may not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe to interpret <hi>Babylon</hi> both of the City of <hi>Rome</hi> and of the Hierarchy; the <hi>Two Witnesses,</hi> of the Old and New Testament, of them under the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal and Evangelical dispensation, and of Magistracy and Ministery; the <hi>Horns of the two-horned Beast,</hi> of the two Imperial Patriarchates, of the two Horns of the Bishop's Mitre, and of the two-fold power of Binding and Loosing. Which second kind of <hi>Henopoeia</hi> need not seem new nor strange, the ancient <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> and <hi>Cabbalists</hi> concealing and crowding together under the Symbol of one single Number many and multifarious Notions.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. <hi>Zoopoeia</hi> is the typifying out some inanimate thing by what has life, be it Person, or any other living Creature, or part of that Creature. In which sense the <hi>Seven Hills</hi> being signifi'd by the <hi>Seven Heads</hi> of the Beast is a <hi>Zoopoeia.</hi> As also it would be if we understood <note n="*" place="margin">Rev. 11.</note>

<pb n="220" facs="tcp:42932:124"/>
the actions of life are given to the bloud of a dead man.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. But we will here take notice also of a second kind of <hi>Zoopoeia,</hi> which may seem less harsh and most elegant; and that is, when free Actions are attributed to free Agents, of which notwithstanding they may be no more the causes then if they were inanimate Beings, or not in being at all. According to this Figure is that of <hi>Virgil,</hi> in the mouth of <hi>Aenea</hi> slay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Turnus,</hi>
                           <q>
                              <l>—Pallas te hoc vulnere, Pallas</l>
                              <l>Immolat, &amp; poenas scelerato ex sanguine sumit.</l>
                           </q>
                           <hi>Pallas</hi> being dead is said to slay <hi>Turnus,</hi> though he did nothing here to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the slaying of him, but what he suffered onely gave occasion to <hi>Aeneas</hi> to take revenge.</p>
                        <p>According to which Figure of speech a more large Allusion or Parable might be raised. As if <hi>Aeneas</hi> instead of slaying one single man had sacked a City, put man, woman and child to the sword, burnt their houses, and left them as an heap of stones in revenge of the death of <hi>Pallas;</hi> he might say of his friend now dead, that it was he that inflamed the courage of the Souldiers to scale the Walls; that it was he that gave out that just, though severe, Edict of slaying man, woman and child; that it was he that burnt down their houses, and laid their City level with the ground; and, lastly, that it was he whom they deservedly found a more mischievous enemy to them after his death then while he was living. Certainly this Figure of speech would be very intelligible, and withall bear along with it an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary height of Rhetorick and Elegancy.</p>
                        <p>According to this Scheme is that example in Scripture of <note n="*" place="margin">Revel. 6. 9.</note> 
                           <hi>the Souls cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the Altar, O Lord, how long,</hi> &amp;c. Which is nothing but a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble signifying that their death required Vengeance from the Justice of God. <hi>Eae animae</hi> (saith <hi>Grotius) corpore solutae multò magis quàm sanguis mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem toleratam testantur.</hi> For he had said before, <hi>Sanguis Abelis vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictam poscit, sic &amp; animae martyrum.</hi> Wherefore there is acknowledged a <hi>Zoopoeia</hi> in both cases.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Alcazar</hi> also upon the place; <hi>Idem est dici Animas petere vindictam ac dici earum sanguinem illam petere.</hi> To which sense also speaks <hi>Tycho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> as you may see in <hi>Ribera.</hi> All which will make good this second kind of <hi>Zoopoeia,</hi> which attributes free and living Actions to free Agents, which in respect of them notwithstanding are no free Actions, but necessary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences that result from something that these persons have suffered or do suffer. Which is a <hi>Prophetick Scheme</hi> worthy the taking notice of.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>ISraelismus</hi> is a Prophetick Scheme exceeding frequent, especially in the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> which is a speaking of the affairs of the Christian Church under the names and with allusion to such places, or persons, or things, as did of old concern the <hi>Israelites</hi> and people of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and that in a mystical or spiritual meaning. <note n="*" place="margin">Rev. 11. 8.</note> 
                           <hi>Which is spiritually called Sodom and Aegypt.</hi> From whence is also insinuated that the Plagues on this <hi>Mystical Aegypt,</hi> and the burning of this <hi>Spiritual Sodom,</hi> must be understood my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stically and spiritually.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The frequency of this Scheme is not to be wondered at, if we consider that the <hi>People of Israel</hi> were one great and entire mysterious Type or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Church of God such as it should be under Christ: According as S. <hi>Paul</hi> has written, <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 10.</note> That <hi>all things befell them in figures, but are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded for our sakes upon whom the ends of the world are come.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And truly it is a marvellous and enravishing spectacle to consider how at once the Church of Christ is represented by the people of <hi>Israel</hi> in the Wilderness, and how their whole Camp was but one living and moving Sacramental Image of Christ and his Body, in the most concerning Points of our <hi>Religion.</hi> For what was that <hi>Tabernacle</hi> and the <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>. And S. <hi>John</hi> speaking of the <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap> saith, <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, <hi>And the Word was made flesh, and placed his tabernacle amongst us,</hi> even as he did in the Wilderness dwell with his people there in a Tabernacle while they dwelt in Booths. And therefore I do wonder
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:42932:125"/>
that the Jews should scruple more the doing Divine Worship toward the most holy Body of the <hi>Messias</hi> then toward the <hi>Dabir</hi> or <hi>Mercy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seat,</hi> or toward the Tabernacle of God. But that onely by the bye.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The Tabernacle therefore of God amongst the Jews living in Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles is a Type or Sacrament of the Incarnation of Christ: The <hi>brasen Serpent</hi> erected in their Camp such a Type of Christ's hanging on the Cross; and the use of it to them so exquisitely analogical to that we Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians make of looking upon Christ's Crucifixion when we are stung with the sense of either the guilt or poison of Sin, that it would even asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish one with amazement to consider what an unexpressible vigour and life of representation does result from this ancient Figure or Shadow, that ever moved along with the Camp of <hi>Israel</hi> in the Wilderness for the healing them when they were bit with fiery flying Serpents, as the cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd <hi>Jesus</hi> does us when we find our selves wounded with Sin.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Manna</hi> also of which the children of <hi>Israel</hi> ate in the Wilderness, was it not a Type of eating that true Bread that came down from Heaven, even the Body of Christ, which is the daily food of the Faithful: And the <hi>Rock</hi> that was struck, out of which came water, was it not an apparent Emblem of the Bloud of Christ, out of whose side came Bloud and Water? <hi>The giving of the Law</hi> also <hi>with flashings of Fire,</hi> was it not plainly a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of the Law of Christ which was divulged by his Apostles, upon whom <hi>fiery Tongues</hi> descended; and is indeed that Law of the Spirit, which, as <hi>Esdras</hi> does interpret, is like unto <hi>fire,</hi> by which the wicked are to be consumed, as that Vision seems to import? <note place="margin">2 Esdr. 13. 38.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. And for the <hi>Divinity of Christ,</hi> is it not plainly emblematized up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Robes of Aaron,</hi> which do so exquisitely resemble the Universe, and therefore can be the cloathing of none but God? And lastly, his <hi>Onely-Mediatourship</hi> and <hi>Apotheosis</hi> after death (for it would be endless to insist upon all) were they not also lively represented, the one by the <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priest's entring alone into the most Holy</hi> to intercede for the people, the other by the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> and <hi>Mercy-seat</hi> toward which the Jews were to worship, as is plain from that in the <hi>Apocalyps?</hi> For to this, in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian dispensation, succeeds the Humane Nature of Christ; he is the <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> or <hi>Mercy-seat,</hi> and his Body the Temple towards which we are to direct our eyes; accordingly as it is written, <hi>I saw no Temple there, but God Almighty and the Lamb is the Temple thereof.</hi> And such a Temple as <note place="margin">Revel. 21.</note> certainly may be worshipped towards with as little suspicion of Idolatry as ever the <hi>Temple</hi> or <hi>Mercy-seat</hi> was amongst the Jews.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Wherefore the people of the Jews being so illustrious and copious a Sacrament of all things appertaining to the Christian Church, it is no wonder that those Visions that concern the State thereof are so full of Allusions to what befell that people. Amongst which Accidents their <hi>Bondage in Aegypt</hi> is of famous note, and therefore often alluded to in the <hi>Apocalyps;</hi> and their <hi>passing through the Red Sea,</hi> where that Tyrant <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was overthrown, so lively a Symbol of the Churche's getting from under that servile yoke of the <hi>Romish</hi> Hierarchy by their recourse to the Bloud of Christ, by which they are justifi'd and freed from that blind bondage they were held in under those hard Task-masters, that
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:42932:125"/>
the Concinnity is marvellous to consider, the Type being so clear a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of what has happened within these last Ages in breaking from that Tyrannicall bondage of the <hi>Italian Pharaoh.</hi> But such Instances as these are infinite.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. The next obscuring Scheme is <hi>Ellipsis,</hi> which is an omission of some word or words which are requisite to determine the sense. Examples of <hi>Ellipses</hi> occurre every-where in the Old Testament, in the <hi>Psalms, Job,</hi> and other Books. But by an <hi>Ellipsis</hi> here I understand not merely the defect of something to make up the full sense, but such an artificial defect as shall make the sense seem compleat without the supplement under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood. For that seems to be the Genius of these <hi>Apocalyptick</hi> Visions especially, that they are made so as to seem very trim and express, very complete and articulate in the very outward <hi>Cortex,</hi> as a Book that has some pleasing Embellishments on the back-side, as well as the History of truth within.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Which I little doubt but may be alluded to in that expression con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Volume of Visions, that it was <note n="*" place="margin">Revel. 5. 1.</note> 
                           <hi>written within and without,</hi> according to the ancient manner of the <hi>Cabbalistick</hi> Mysteries. Touching which Traditions <hi>Parmenides</hi> had got that Principle, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> That there is a twofold traditionary Knowledge, the one Truth, (it is called <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> in <hi>Daniel</hi> in counterdistinction to his Aenigmatical Visions) the other Types or Parables accommodate to the conceit and gust of the Vulgar.</p>
                        <p>S. <hi>Hierom</hi> also, <hi>Rupertus</hi> and several others understand this being <hi>writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten within and on the back-side,</hi> of a <hi>Literal</hi> and <hi>Mystical</hi> sense. <hi>Grotius</hi> pretends the Text is not rightly comma'd, but reads it thus, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>Written within, and sealed on the back-side:</hi> As if there were any Books written on the back-side and sealed within. So unfortunate an Interpreter of the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> is the great <hi>Hugo</hi> even in lesser matters. But to return to the matter in hand.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. The difference of those two kinds of <hi>Ellipses</hi> we have described may be seen in these Examples. <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. where <hi>Moses</hi> asking God his Name, he returns this answer, <hi>I am that I am:</hi> which is an <hi>Elliptical</hi> speech, and fully supplied, is, <hi>My Name is I am that I am.</hi> Something like this is that also in the <note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 1. 4.</note> Apocalyps, <hi>Grace to you and peace</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                           </gap>. But these <hi>Ellipses</hi> are such that they discover the defect of what is to be supplied.</p>
                        <p>But sometimes it is not so, as <hi>Apocal. 17. 8. The Beast which thou sawest, was, and is not, and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and goe into perdition.</hi> And a little after, <hi>When they behold the Beast that was, and is not, and yet is.</hi> Which seems a smooth entire sense in the exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour <hi>Cortex</hi> of the Prophecy, whenas no good sense at all can be made of it unless there be conceived some such <hi>Ellipsis</hi> as before; <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, and, <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>. But to have been thus express had laid this Mystery over-open, which ought to be in a greater measure concealed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:42932:126"/>
it was thus carefully lock'd up in this Prophetick <hi>Ellipsis.</hi> Of which Text more fully in its proper place.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. <hi>Homonymia</hi> is the Diversity of significations in one and the same Symbol, whereof one alone is to be understood, else it were coincident with an <hi>Henopoeia</hi> of the second kind. Which <hi>Homonymia</hi> may fall out <hi>ex accidenti,</hi> (and is of no greater difficulty then that ordinary <hi>Homonymia</hi> of words, whose sense the consideration of the contexture of things will determine;) or else it may be intended of set purpose to make up a more gracefull insculpture upon the external <hi>Cortex</hi> of a Vision. As in the Vision of <hi>the Witnesses,</hi> I suspect that the <hi>three days and an half</hi> that they lie dead in the street do not signify, as in the beginning of that Vision, <hi>three years and an half,</hi> but <hi>three times and an half,</hi> that is, 1260 years. Nay that they do signify so, I do confess I do more then suspect, am indeed well assured in my own judgement of the truth thereof. But whether there be any likelihood of their signifying also <hi>three years and an half</hi> Events will better determine. Which if they did, there would not be a simple <hi>Homonymia</hi> in this Symbol of <hi>three days and an half,</hi> but an <hi>Henopoeia</hi> of the second kind.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. <hi>Metalepsis</hi> is a Prophetick Scheme whereby an Effect or Event is transferred or communicated to some eminent <hi>Person</hi> merely, or at least mainly, because the place and time is coincident with his; and there is the same reason of <hi>Things.</hi> This Scheme I must confess is very Poetical, but not unelegant nor unusuall. Like to this is that of <hi>Virgil,</hi>

Where <hi>Taurus</hi> and <hi>Libra,</hi> because they are then in conjunction with the <hi>Sun,</hi> have attributed to them or transferred upon them those Effects which really are the <hi>Sun</hi>'s onely and not theirs.</p>
                        <p>But that there is such a <hi>Metalepsis</hi> as I have described in the Prophetick style, that one example of the <hi>Rider of the red Horse</hi> in the <note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 6. 4.</note> 
                           <hi>Apocalyps</hi> will make good, who is armed with <hi>a great sword</hi> in his hand, and is said <hi>to take peace from the Earth:</hi> Whenas nothing else is signified, but that in this Emperour's time there would be very furious killing and slaying in the Empire, though by no fault of his. For it is said, <hi>they should kill one another,</hi> as if the Text on purpose did cast in that key for the opening the meaning of the Vision, as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> has judiciously observed. Whose interpretation of the <hi>First six Seals</hi> is so solid, that it is impossible, I think, taking all things together, for any unprejudiced Reader not to be assured of the truth of them. Whence it is that I am so well assured of this present Prophetick Figure I have set down.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. <hi>Antichronismus</hi> is an obscurative Scheme in Prophecy which sets down one measure of time for another; as a <hi>Week</hi> for <hi>Seven years,</hi> as in <hi>Daniel,</hi> a <hi>Month</hi> for <hi>Thirty years,</hi> a <hi>Day</hi> for a <hi>Year.</hi> Which Figure seems to be used in the Apocalyptick Visions not onely for concealment sake, but for proportion and <hi>Decorum,</hi> that the external <hi>Cortex</hi> of the Prophecies may not want their <gap reason="foreign">

WE have shewn wherein the <hi>Obscurity</hi> of Prophecy does mainly consist, and by the explication of the foregoing Figures have already done something toward the making of the skill of Interpreting easy to us. But there being so many and so various Examples of the last Scheme, we hold it needfull to bring the most considerable of them into one <hi>Alphabet,</hi> and to set down the signification of them. Which being taken notice of will much conduce to the easy spelling out the true meaning of all Aenigmatical Prophecies in Scripture. For what <note n="*" place="margin">In his <gap reason="foreign">

                           <hi>Aristotle</hi> says of Aenigmatical <hi>Dreams,</hi> is true also of these kind of <hi>Visions.</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>Now the <hi>Visions</hi> of <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Apocalyps</hi> are not of the nature of <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, representing things under Symbols or Similitudes: And therefore to have a settled and determinate meaning (and that upon solid and rational grounds) of such Symbols and <hi>Iconisms</hi> must needs contribute much to the inabling us with ease and success to interpret these Prophecies, or to make us understand and approve or with judgment disapprove of the Interpretations of other men.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. And for my own part I know no solider method of settling and secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to our selves the true sense of these <hi>Symbols,</hi> then by attending what the Scripture it self declares of them, and by strictly observing what Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son will unforcedly suggest or spy out concerning their significancy and representativeness of things. To which if we adde the Suffrages of them that have wrote of <hi>Onirocriticks,</hi> whether most-what out of their own reason and observation, as <hi>Artemidorus</hi> professes, or (which is more to our purpose) have made a Collection of the most ancient Writings of that kind, such as <hi>Achmetes</hi> the son of <hi>Seirim</hi> has provided us; it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:42932:127"/>
but strengthen our assurance of the meaning of such <hi>Iconisms.</hi>

                        <p n="3">3. And these of <hi>Achmetes</hi> more especially, they being the <hi>Onirocriticks</hi> of three famous Interpreters of the Kings of <hi>India, Persia</hi> and <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and therefore being so ancient and so Eastern, the more probable to have a greater cognation with the Prophetick Schemes of the Holy Writ. The first of these is <hi>Syrbacham,</hi> Interpreter to the King of <hi>India:</hi> but he does Christianize so frequently and so palpably, that his Antiquity may be much suspected, and necessarily concluded since the coming of Christ. The second is <hi>Baram,</hi> Interpreter to <hi>Saanisan</hi> King of <hi>Persia;</hi> and the last <hi>Tarphan,</hi> Interpreter to <hi>Pharao</hi> King of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> The use of whose Interpretations is approved even by Expositors of quite different ways, <hi>Grotius</hi> I mean and Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> who has the honour of first breaking the ice in this business.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Nor is there any scruple for that these are the Interpretations of <hi>Dreams,</hi> and not of <hi>Visions:</hi> For besides that there is a great affinity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Visions</hi> and <hi>Dreams,</hi> they being both Phantasms impressed on the Imagination, not by any free act or excitation of our selves, but in a way merely passive, the external Senses also being in a manner consopite in both, (whence these <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>Wherefore it will not be impertinent to adjoyn sometimes the suffrage of these <hi>Onirocritical</hi> Writers to what weight we produce out of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture and from Reason, for the interpreting of such <hi>Symbols</hi> or <hi>Iconisms</hi> as we shall comprise in our <hi>Prophetick Alphabet;</hi> which I shall now exhibit to view.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. <hi>Angels.</hi> There is such frequent mention of the Ministery of <hi>Angels</hi> in the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> and the Presidency there so prefixed to every thing, that I cannot omit to take notice of this Scheme amongst the rest, though peradventure it does not fall so right under the notion of an <hi>Icasmus,</hi> they being rather the Instruments of Divine Providence then the Emblem of it. But if we reflect upon their vulgar representation, (which doubtless took its ground from the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Cherubims) how well they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed with wings for the quicker dispatch of those services that are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of them, they are not unsignificative of that Wisdom that is <note n="*" place="margin">Wisd. 8.</note> said to be more quick and moving then any motion, and to reach from one end to another mightily and sweetly to order all things.</p>

And therefore as the loss of the one is the death of the one, so the loss of the other is the death of the other. And because there is a Spirit in all things, even in those things that are inanimate, the fading or vanishing of that spirit may be said analogically to be the <hi>Death</hi> of those things. Instances are innumerable. I will onely adde, that as in the Hebrew Idiom <hi>not to be</hi> is <hi>to be dead;</hi> so in analogie any thing that is not what it was, namely, any thing that is changed from its former condition, this change thereof may goe for a kind of <hi>Death;</hi> as <hi>Death</hi> is ordinarily said to be a Change.</p>

                        <p>But <hi>Harvest</hi> sometimes has a more auspicious sense, as in that of our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 4. 35. <hi>Behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to Harvest. And he that reapeth, receiveth wages and gathereth fruit to life eternal, that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.</hi>

For we have three terms of the Analogie here also; viz. a Kingdom and the Sovereignty thereof, and a <hi>Beast</hi> which is the Prophetick figure of a Kingdom: Wherefore we cannot miss to say, As a Kingdom is to the Sovereign Power thereof, so is this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick or figurative Beast to the Head thereof; and alternately, As the Kingdom to the Beast, so the Sovereign Power of the Kingdom to the Head of the Beast. Whence we see plainly that the <hi>Head</hi> of a Beast answers to the Supreme Power, and that whether the Supreme Power be in one single Person or in many. For as the Power abstractedly is not considered, so neither the Persons abstracted from their Power; but both, <hi>in concreto,</hi> make up this <hi>Head</hi> Politick. And therefore if the Supreme be not but in <hi>many,</hi> those <hi>many</hi> are the Head; and not the less <hi>one Head</hi> for consisting of <hi>many</hi> persons, no more then the Body is less <hi>one Body</hi> for consisting of <hi>many</hi> persons. Nay, if a man should follow the Symmetry of his Phancy rather then his Reason, a <hi>Head of many persons</hi> to a Body of a vast multitude of persons would look more ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly and proportionably then one single person: As if a Beast were made of little wax bullets sticking together, a head of one bullet put to it would not look so conformably as an head of many bullets, such as the whole body consisted of.</p>

                           <hi>Throne of God.</hi> The <hi>Throne of God</hi> signifies a great Throne, a magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent Throne, according to that usual Hebraism, where Nouns joyned with <gap reason="foreign">

So the <hi>Trees of God,</hi> the <hi>Cedars of God,</hi> the <hi>Mountains of God,</hi> are great and high Trees, Cedars and Mountains, the <hi>Fire of God</hi> a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>Fire,</hi> and the like.

                        <p n="3">3. <hi>Thunder.

Yea he sent out his arrows and scattered them, and he shot out lightnings and discomfited them.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. But there is also another more <hi>Mystical</hi> signification of <hi>Thunder; Prophecy</hi> or <hi>Revelation from God</hi> being signifi'd thereby, by way of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion to <gap reason="foreign">

                           <hi>Filia vocis,</hi> which is one kind of <hi>Prophecy.</hi> Such was that voice from Heaven testifying of our Saviour Christ, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 17. as also <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 28. where the people that stood by said, <hi>It thundered.</hi> See <hi>Drusius</hi> upon the place. But besides this, <hi>Thunder</hi> has of it self a signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy of <hi>Prophecy,</hi> the one being the Voice of Heaven, and called the <hi>voice of God,</hi> the other an Oracle from God.</p>
                        <p>But there is yet another sense that <hi>Thunder</hi> may be capable of; as, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of some special and signal Promulgation of the Gospel to a people that has not yet either heard of it, assented to it, or rightly believed it; and this by an allusion to the Law given to the <hi>Israelites</hi> in <hi>Thunder and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:</hi> not to say, with some respect to the manner of God's witnessing out of the clouds to his Son Christ, and declaring of him, in a voice of <note n="*" place="margin">Joh. 12. 28, 29.</note>

that he had glorifi'd him, and would glorifie him again. See <hi>Fire.</hi>

                        <p n="5">5. <hi>Time.</hi> That a <hi>Time and Times and half a Time</hi> in <hi>Daniel</hi> signifies <hi>three years and an half,</hi> we have the suffrage of <hi>Grotius,</hi> and indeed no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters that I know dissent. But this Figure of speech is referrible to none of the Prophetick Schemes which I have set down, but is a mere <hi>Synecdoche Generis;</hi> as <hi>Hour</hi> is indeed a <hi>Synecdoche Speciei,</hi> when it is put for an indefinite short time, as it is sometimes.

                        <p>This use of an <hi>Hour</hi> in the ordinary style is, as I said, but a <hi>Synecdoche Speciei,</hi> but in the Prophetick style there is a <hi>Diorismus</hi> in it. But as for a <hi>Day</hi> when it is taken for a <hi>Year,</hi> it is an <hi>Icasmus,</hi> there being a Circuit of the Sun in each, and therefore they bear a similitude one to another. From whence it will follow that if <hi>one Day</hi> will stand for <hi>one Year,</hi> then in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion <hi>one Month of days</hi> will stand for <hi>Thirty years.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">6. But that numbering by <hi>Months</hi> is appropriate to the works of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, as reflecting upon the Circuits of the <hi>Moon,</hi> which is the Governess of the Night, and numbering by the courses of the <hi>Sun</hi> appropriate to the works of Righteousness, is, as I have noted already, an observation of Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s, and is exactly true in the <hi>Apocalyps:</hi> where the <hi>continuing of the Beast</hi> and the <hi>prophaning of the holy City by the Gentiles</hi> is reckoned by <hi>Months;</hi> but the <hi>Prophecy of the Witnesses;</hi> as also their undergoing that Martyrdom, and their lying unburied, by <hi>Days.</hi> The abode of the Woman in the Wilderness is also numbered by <hi>Days,</hi> and by <hi>a time and times and half a time;</hi> which, according to this curiosity of Appropriation, must of necessity signifie <hi>three Solar years and an half;</hi> of which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding they fall short near twenty days. But <hi>Modicum nec curat Praetor nec Propheta</hi> is better here applied then as <hi>Grotius</hi> applies it. And hence it is demonstrable that there is a concealed or tacit latitude of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years at least in these 1260 days, which are the same with a <hi>Time and Times and half a Time;</hi> and that the first measure may be an <hi>Icad.</hi> But because the Sixty sounds, and that is silent in this Number, it is not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable but an <hi>Hexecad</hi> might, if need were, be taken for the first measure or Divisor of 1260.

that it is his duty to be so, and that that high act of Religion and devotio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Love which is due to him should not in any measure be diverted upon another, but that the eye of our Mind should be wholly fixed upon him.

We see therefore the Analogie betwixt <hi>Whoredom</hi> and <hi>Idolatry.</hi> For as in <hi>Whoredom</hi> that special kind of passion and the proper effects thereof, which are due onely to a Legitimate Husband, are derived upon some other person; so in <hi>Idolatry</hi> that summity and flower of our Divinest affection, which is Religious Devotion and Adoration, with the outward signs thereof due to God alone, are discharged and exercised upon some Creature, whether Idols of wood and stone, or any other things which are not God. This is a fundamental reason of this frequent <hi>Iconism</hi> in Scripture.</p>
                        <p>To which you may adde some other few Resemblances. As the Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of God's jealousie against them especially that be in an exteriour Covenant with him: The ornamental Pompousness in <hi>Idolatry,</hi> answering to the garishness of Whores and the pranking up themselves to allure their Paramours: The Pronity also and Propenseness to fall into this sin, it being even as natural to this corrupt condition of the Soul to dote on a visible Object of Worship, as for the Body to incline to the reaping of those joys it presages upon every inticing Object, did not an higher Law forbid it in both cases. To which you may further adde the Remorseles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Conscience which men easily fall into in both sins, they rowing down so easily with the stream, and their Animal nature being so much gratifi'd by them. <hi>Such is the way of the adulterous woman</hi> in both senses; <hi>She cateth and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness.</hi>

                        <p n="16">16. We will onely annex a few <hi>Rules concerning the Preference of one Interpretation of Prophecy before another,</hi> and then conclude.</p>

                              <p>That Interpretation that keeps close to the approved Examples and Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie of the Prophetick style is to be preferred before such as are framed at pleasure according to the private phancy of the Interpreter.</p>
                           </argument>
                           <p>The ground of <hi>this Rule</hi> is this, That besides that it is safer to follow an approved Example then to be destitute thereof, and wholly lean upon a mans private sense; the very style of the Prophets being as it were a peculiar language or dialect, there is a necessity of understanding things according to the meaning of their dialect or language, and not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

to what it would sound in our own. Which is as fond and ridiculous, as if an English-man in hearing of Latin spoken, where the word <hi>Fur</hi> is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casionally brought in, should think the <hi>Furre</hi> of an Alderman's Gown were meant; or at the sounding of <gap reason="foreign">

As if because <hi>Vices</hi> and <hi>Vertues</hi> are painted out in the figure of <hi>Women</hi> or <hi>Beasts,</hi> we should therefore ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that meaning to the <hi>Prophetick style;</hi> whenas they always signifie a Body Politick, even in that very Scheme where abstract Inscriptions are upon them: as <hi>Zech.</hi> 5. 7. where <hi>the Woman in the Epha</hi> is said to be <hi>Wickedness.</hi> By which Woman notwithstanding <hi>Vatablus</hi> understands the Ten Tribes revolted to Idolatry, and other Interpreters expound it to the same purpose.

                              <p>That Interpretation that keeps one tenour of sense of the same words, in one and the same Vision especially, is to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that which varies backward and forward, and takes the same word in as many different senses as it occurs in different places of the Vision.</p>

                           <p>To be in many tales is accounted an infallible sign of a false story; and to vary the Interpretation of the same word in one and the same Vision, without any account or reason, is as great a demonstration of fraud and forcedness in the Interpretation, and that the Interpreter was biassed by some design or interest, and that he has done violence to the Text for his own advantage. As for example, If one should interpret that <hi>Iconism</hi> of a <hi>Beast,</hi> one while to signifie a <hi>Kingdom</hi> or <hi>Empire,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other while <hi>some single Person of that Empire,</hi> and then again <hi>some grand Vice</hi> thereof; were not this a mere botch in comparison of interpreting <hi>this Beast</hi> of such a <hi>Kingdom</hi> or <hi>Body Politick</hi> in every place of the Vision? I might instance in other such like shufflings, but this one intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion shall suffice.</p>

                           <argument>
                              <p>That Interpretation that does concern the affairs of Religion and the Church of God, and is of the greatest use and serviceableness to us, is a more likely Interpretation and to be preferred before that which less respects us, but seems to make the Spirit of God to have predicted things with little or no reference to the usefulness of the Church.</p>

                           <p>The truth of <hi>this Rule</hi> appears not onely from the perpetual Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Prophecy, where it is rare to find any that do not respect the Church of God some way or other in a special manner, (for even the <note n="*" place="margin">Rev. 6.</note>

For if the number of Prophecies be not limited by this measure, what must be the bounds of them?
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:42932:145"/>

                              <p>Those Interpretations are more likely to be true that are suggested to a Minde unprejudiced and unbiassed by any outward respects, then those that are made by such as the sense of Interest, worldly hopes or fears, or any feud or disgust may put a false biass upon, and make the judgement partial.</p>
                           </argument>
                           <p>The truth of <hi>this Rule</hi> is plain at first sight, but I must confess the usefulness is more maimed and uncertain.

The <hi>Two-horned Beast</hi> and the <hi>Whore of Babylon</hi> are both the Restorers and Promoters of Idolatry in the Empire. Agreement II. They both had the Rule and government over the <hi>Seven-headed Beast with ten Horns.</hi> Agreement III. They both aspired to a Majesty and Power plainly Imperial. Agreement IV. They both were workers of Miracles, or a kinde of Magicians or Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and that in reference to the restoring of Idolatry. Agreement V. They are both Pretenders to Sanctity, and make a show of acting in the behalf of Christ, when indeed they are Introducers of Idolatry and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christianism. Agreement VI. They are both cruel and bloudy Persecutors of the Saints and of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of <hi>Jesus.</hi> Agreement VII. They are both so described as to have a Jurisdiction over the whole Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, as well Oriental as Occidental.
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:42932:146"/>
Agreement VIII. The Seat of them both is so indigitated at first, as that it may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood to be as well at <hi>New Rome</hi> or <hi>Constantinople</hi> as at <hi>Old Rome.</hi> Agreement IX. Both their Seats are afterwards expresly determined to <hi>Old Rome.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. <hi>The Parallelism of Agreements betwixt the Seven-headed Beast with ten Horns in the Thirteenth Chapter and the Seven-headed Beast with ten Horns in the Seventeenth.</hi> Agreement I. They both have seven Heads and ten Horns. Agreement II. The bodies of them both are set out by the Symbols of Cruelty and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry. Agreement III. In both Visions this Seven-headed Beast is a Beast that had in some sort ceased to be, and was restored, and healed, and revived again. Agreement IV. The time of the Death or of the Non-existence of either was not long. Agreement V. In neither Vision this Beast is so perfectly restored as to be utterly the same again, but rather the <hi>Image of the former;</hi> or is so the former in one sense that it is not in another. Whence it is called <hi>The Beast that is not, and yet is;</hi> or, <hi>Was, and is not, and yet is.</hi> Agreement VI. Both the Beasts are said to rise out of the Sea. Agreement VII. They are both ordained to destruction, as not being that Kingdome of the Saints that is to last for ever and ever. Agreement VIII. Of both these restored Beasts it is said, that <hi>they whose Names are not written in the Book of Life shall worship them and wonder after them.</hi> Agreement IX. The Seven Heads in each Beast are Idolatrous Heads. Agreement X. The Beasts are slain or exterminated out of Being in the Sixth Head, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored or revived in the Seventh. Agreement XI. The ten Horns in neither Beast did actually reign in S. <hi>John</hi>'s time. Agreement XII. The ten Horns in each Beast begin their reign with the Beast. Agreement XIII. The ten Horns in each Beast give their strength to the Beast. Agreement XIV. The Beasts in each Vision make warre with the Saints. Agreement XV. The Saints in each Vision overcome the Beast at last. Agreement XVI. The Faith and Constancy of the Saints is exercised by both the Beasts.
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:42932:147"/>
Agreement XVII. The time of each Beast is said to be determined by God, and to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted by his holy Prophets. Agreement XVIII. The Seat of this <hi>Seven-headed Beast</hi> is not set down, (but left free in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Vision) though the Seat of the <hi>Whore</hi> and the <hi>Two-horned Beast</hi> be determined: which has an admirable correspondence with the Event.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. These be the two <hi>Parallelisms of Agreements:</hi> concerning the latter whereof I dare affirm that it is so exact and adequate, that the Parallels betwixt the <hi>Seven-headed Beast</hi> in the <hi>Thirteenth</hi> Chapter and the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven-headed Beast</hi> in the <hi>Seventeenth</hi> exhaust all in each Chapter concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that Beast. The former Parallelism is not so accurate, the <hi>Original of the Two-horned</hi> Beast being parallel to nothing in the <hi>Whore,</hi> and the <hi>Destruction of the Whore</hi> parallel to nothing in the <hi>Two-horned Beast</hi> as he is there described. Wherefore there is that peculiar in the Vision of the 17. Chapter, that it treats also of the <hi>judgement</hi> of the two-horned Beast or the Whore, according to the very title of the Vision, <hi>I will shew thee the judgement of the great Whore.</hi> But this is no argument at all against the Identity of their persons, especially the <hi>Two-horned Beast</hi> being also to be destroyed, and at the same time with the <hi>Whore,</hi> as it is easie to be made out by the Apocalyptick <hi>Synchronisms.</hi> And as for the omission of the <hi>Original of the Whore</hi> to parallel the <hi>Original of the Two-horned Beast,</hi> that is no argument against their Identity neither. Indeed if there had been an <hi>Original</hi> assigned to the <hi>Whore</hi> different from that of the <hi>Two-horned Beast,</hi> it had been something; but this bare omission signifies nothing but the art and accuracy of the very out-side of these Visions, which keep a <hi>Decorum</hi> in all things. And therefore because it was not so seemly nor su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to say a <hi>Woman rose out of the Earth,</hi> (though Brutes did so, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 24.) the mention of <hi>her Original</hi> was fairly declined.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. But whenas a lesser number of Agreements in each Parallelism (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided there were nothing contrary) could not but have been a strong pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption of the Identity of the Subjects of the Visions in each Chapter, I mean, <hi>That the Two-horned Beast and the Whore are one, and the Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed Beast in each Chapter the same;</hi> how fully assured must we needs be of these Identities, the Agreements of these two Parallelisms (those pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages onely excepted of which I have given so fair an account) perfectly exhausting the whole substance of each Chapter? Which that it may be more plainly discerned, I shall expose to your eies the whole XVII. Chapter, and to every Verse in order subjoin what is parallel to it in the XIII. For we shall see it will imbibe the whole Chapter. Apoc. Chap. 17. 1. <hi>And there came one of the seven Angels which had the seven Vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither, I will shew unto thee the judgement of the great Whore that sitteth upon many Waters.</hi> Chap. 13. Most of this first verse of this Seventeenth Chapter of the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> is but Introductory to the Vision, no part of the Vision it self, and therefore there needs no Parallel to it in this Thirteenth Chapter. But how the <hi>Whore's being</hi>
                           <pb n="265" facs="tcp:42932:147"/>
                           <hi>placed upon many waters</hi> may seem to comply with one of our Parallels, I shall note in its due place, when I come to give a Joint-Exposition of these two Chapters. Chap. 17. 2. <hi>With whom the Kings of the Earth have committed</hi>

                        <p n="7">7. Thus you see the <hi>Two Visions</hi> of the Thirteenth Chapter wholy imbibed into the Vision of the Seventeenth, excepting the <hi>Original of the Two-horned Beast,</hi> of which I have given an account already. And that it is naturally drunk in, not dash'd in by force, will appear from that joint-Exposition which I shall make of these two Chapters together, interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting those verses or parts of verses of the Thirteenth which I have sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected to each verse of the Seventeeth, together with the verses they are in order subnected to. But before I set upon this task, I will first prepare the way by making good a certain Position that is of main concern and of common influence for the clearing and ascertaining of the true meaning of the <hi>Visions</hi> in both Chapters. Which I shall doe as accurately, and yet as briefly, as I can.</p>
                     </div>
                     <div n="11" type="chapter">

                        <argument>
                           <p>1. The great importance of proving the <hi>Seven Heads</hi> of the Beast to be <hi>Seven Sorts of Governours.</hi> 2. That the proving of the Seven-headed Beast to signify the Idolatrous Roman Kingdom or Empire <hi>quatenus</hi> Idolatrous, will go far toward the proof of the former Position. 3. That the Seven-headed Beast is a Kingdom or Empire; 4. And particularly the <hi>Roman.</hi> 5. That it is the Idolatrous <hi>Roman</hi> Kingdom or Empire. 6. That it is this Idolatrous Empire or Kingdom through all those Ages it is Idolatrous. 7. That it represents the <hi>Roman</hi> Kingdom or Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire in those Ages onely in which it is Idolatrous. Whence the true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the <hi>slaying of the Beast,</hi> and a further confirmation of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Assertion, is to be understood. 8. That this adequate Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Idolatrous duration of the Empire implies that no Seven single Persons can be the Seven Heads thereof. 9. The same conclusion
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:42932:149"/>
inferred from the Stigmatizing these <hi>Seven Heads</hi> with the note of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> whenas more then <hi>Seven,</hi> nay all, of the Pagan Emperours were Idolaters. 10. Also from the ordinary form of speech in distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing Animals by the number of their parts. 11. And finally from the certainty of the Seventh Head's being not one single Person but a Succession. 12. That what-ever Interpretation supposes these Seven Heads Seven single persons is not onely false, but impossible. 13. That it follows from what has been evinced, That the Beast in the 17 chap. of the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> is the Roman Empire degenerated again into a kind of Paganism. 14. As also that the <hi>Whore of Babylon</hi> is not <hi>Rome Pagan,</hi> but <hi>Pagano-christian.</hi> 15. And that the coming of Antichrist at the very last end of the World is a Chimericall Fiction. 16. The true Subject of the Visions of the 17 and 13 Chapters of the <hi>Revelation.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </argument>
                        <p n="1">1. THE Position which I mentioned, and which is of so great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, is this; <hi>That the Seven Heads of the Beast are not any seven single Persons, whether Emperours or any other Supreme Governours, but Seven sorts of Governours succeeding one another.</hi> Which being cleared, we shall then be infallibly assured what is the Subject and the genuine sense of the Visions of these two Chapters we have in hand.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. And truly we shall strike very far into the proof of this so impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant a Thesis, if we can but make good this preparatory Conclusion thereto, namely, <hi>That the Beast with seven Heads and ten Horns signifies the Idolatrous Roman Kingdom or Empire</hi> quatenus <hi>Idolatrous,</hi> that is to say, <hi>when and so long as Idolatrous, and no farther.</hi> The truth of which Proposition I shall endeavour to demonstrate gradually and by parts.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. First therefore, That by <hi>Beast</hi> is understood a <hi>Kingdom</hi> or <hi>Empire,</hi> it is needless here to repeat, having proved that in my <hi>Prophetick Alpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet;</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Chap. 5. Sect. 9.</note> as also advertised in my first Rule of comparing Interpretations of Prophecy, how absonous and ridiculous it is not to interpret Prophetick Figures according to the approved meaning and observable use of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick style. To which, lastly, you may adde, that the <hi>Seven Heads</hi> of the Beast being interpreted <hi>Seven Kings</hi> in succession, and the <hi>Ten Horns Ten Kings</hi> at once appertaining to it, it must of necessity be a Kingdom or Empire.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Secondly, That this <hi>Seven-headed Beast with Ten Horns</hi> is the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Kingdom</hi> or <hi>Empire,</hi> besides that those Ten Horns answerable to the Beast with ten Horns in <hi>Daniel</hi> (which the Church has constantly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted of the <hi>Roman</hi> State) seem to defix and determinate the Prophecy to that sense, the <hi>Whore of Babylon,</hi> which is said to sit on this Beast with seven Heads, which is universally understood of <hi>Rome, (Alcazar</hi> cites at least twenty Interpreters) must of necessity infer the same. And, lastly, the Interpretation of the Angel, who makes the <hi>Seven Heads</hi> of the Beast to signify as well <hi>Seven Hills</hi> as <hi>Seven Kings,</hi> does plainly demonstrate that the Beast is <hi>Roman,</hi> the Hills being the Hills of <hi>Rome.</hi> For how can the <hi>Seven Hills of Rome</hi> be said to be the Beast's <hi>Seven Heads,</hi> if the Beast were not the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire?</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="270" facs="tcp:42932:150"/>
But that the <hi>Seven Hills</hi> do denote <hi>Rome, Ribera</hi> himself dares not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; and <hi>Grotius</hi> expresly upon the Text, <hi>Noti satis Montes ex Poetis &amp; Historiis, nec ulla poterat ad describendam Romam adferri nota illustrior.</hi> And it is universally the sense of all Interpreters. And Bishop <hi>Mountague,</hi> who would extend it to the <hi>Turkish Empire,</hi> which has gotten the possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> (which History has also in some measure noted for her <hi>seven Hills)</hi> yet he does not exclude <hi>Old Rome</hi> from the Angel's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation. But that the <hi>Seven-headed Beast</hi> cannot be the <hi>Turkish Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,</hi> we may conclude with Mathematick certitude; Because it is an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire that had continued the Succession of <hi>Five Heads</hi> in S. <hi>John</hi>'s time, whenas the <hi>Turkish Empire</hi> was not so much as in being by many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years. Nor was there any Empire whose Metropolis was famous for Seven Hills but the <hi>Roman.</hi> Whence we have all desirable assurance that the <hi>Beast with Seven Heads and Ten Horns</hi> is the <hi>Roman Empire.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">5. Thirdly, That this <hi>Seven-headed Beast</hi> is the <hi>Idolatrous Roman Kingdom</hi> or <hi>Empire,</hi> may appear from several indications. As first, in that this very Figure of a <hi>Beast</hi> in that sense that the <hi>Greek</hi> word sounds, which is <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>Fera,</hi> does of it self signifie an <hi>Idolatrous Kingdom</hi> or <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,</hi> as I have already made good in my <hi>Prophetick Alphabet:</hi> which <note place="margin">Chap. 5. Sect. 9.</note> alone were sufficient to evince this third part of our Assertion.</p>
                        <p>But besides this, it is observable that in every Vision wherein this <hi>Seven-headed Beast</hi> is represented, there is that which plainly speaks him <hi>Idolatrous.</hi> As <hi>Apocalyps</hi> 12. he is a <hi>Dragon</hi> or <hi>Serpent.</hi> Which therefore must needs be a <hi>Pagan Power,</hi> or <hi>Idolatrous Empire;</hi> his shape being the very Effigies of the <hi>Devil,</hi> his War against the Church of Christ, and his downfall the Exaltation of Christ's Kingdom. And <hi>Grotius</hi> himself will acknowledge that this <note n="*" place="margin">Rev. 12.</note> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>this great red Dragon,</hi> is <hi>Mars</hi> the President-Daemon of the Roman Polity, which was as notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously <hi>Idolatrous</hi> as <hi>Cruel.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now as it is certain that the <hi>red Dragon</hi> is the <hi>Idolatrous Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire;</hi> so that the <hi>Seven-headed Beast</hi> in the 13 Chapter is the same <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Empire,</hi> is as certainly imply'd, in that it is the Beast healed of that deadly wound it had in its conflict with the Host of <hi>Michael,</hi> and in that the <hi>Dragon</hi> is said <hi>to have delivered his power to this Beast,</hi> and this Beast is termed the <hi>Image of the Dragon</hi> that was so mortally wounded: As also chap. 17. the <hi>Seven-headed Beast</hi> there exhibited is said to be <hi>the Beast that was:</hi> and, I pray, who was that but the <hi>Dragon?</hi> and therefore this <hi>Draco redivivus</hi> or this <hi>Image of the Dragon</hi> cannot but be an <hi>Idolatrous Empire,</hi> or the Empire again becoming Idolatrous.</p>
                        <p>And, lastly, lest the Reader should not be heedful enough to observe the Idolatry of the <hi>Seven-headed Beast</hi> in the 13 and 17 Chapters from this consideration I have named, the Spirit of God has farther and more expresly stigmatized him with this Note in both those Visions, placing <hi>the Name of Blasphemy</hi> on his Seven Heads in the 13 Chapter, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring his Body to be full of the <hi>Names of Blasphemy</hi> in the 17, by <hi>Blasphemy</hi> meaning <hi>Idolatry,</hi> as I have abundantly proved in my <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick Alphabet.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">6. Fourthly, That these Visions exhibit the <hi>Roman Empire Idolatrous</hi>
                           <pb n="271" facs="tcp:42932:150"/>
                           <hi>through all the time it was so or was to be so,</hi> appears, First, from the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral nature of these Prophetick Figures, where a <hi>Beast</hi> signifies a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom <note place="margin">See Chap. 3. Sect. 6.</note> or Empire in its entire succession and duration, unless any thing be intimated to the contrary. Which is clear as well from those examples in <hi>Daniel,</hi> where the <hi>Four Beasts</hi> signifie so many Kingdoms in their entire Successions, as also from the very nature of that Prophetick Scheme which we call <hi>Henopoeia,</hi> which always goes along with these <hi>Iconisms</hi> of Beasts. For an <hi>Henopoeia</hi> is nothing else but a Collection as well of Succession as of Multitude into one Individual Form or Shape, be it Humane or Belluine.</p>
                        <p>Again, in that the <hi>Seven-headed Beast</hi> in the 13 Chapter is said to be the <hi>Image of the Dragon,</hi> and the said Beast in the 17 to be <hi>the Beast that was,</hi> which certainly was the <hi>Dragon,</hi> this shews that those Visions intend to represent the Empire through all the times of its being Idolatrous, as well the times of its primitive or purely Pagan Idolatry, as of the <hi>Image</hi> or <hi>Restauration thereof</hi> in a <hi>Paganish</hi> or <hi>Idolatrous kind of Christianity.</hi> Or more fully thus: This Seven-headed Beast is represented under some one of his Heads to fight and to be wounded to death, but after to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived; also to have been for a certain time, and then to cease to be, but after to be again, and then finally to perish. Wherefore the whole Duration and Continuance of the Beast seems to be comprised therein, divided into two parts by this death and interceasing of the Beast for a time: Of which the plain sense is this, The Roman Kingdom or Empire has been and shall be a <hi>Beast,</hi> that is to say, <hi>Idolatrous,</hi> for a certain <hi>series</hi> of time, then cease to be so for a while, but after be Idolatrous again, and then cease to be so for ever. These Prophetick Figures therefore, I mean these Beasts, that exhibit this sense, must needs imply these two entire parts of time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Empire is represented Idolatrous: as he that divides a Line into two, divides the whole Line into two parts.</p>
                        <p>To all which you may adde, That the Seven Heads of the Dragon being represented as actually crowned, whenas yet Five were gone in S. <hi>John</hi>'s time, and but one present, and therefore the Seventh not yet in being; it plainly intimates that the whole Duration and Succession of the Beast is exhibited at once. Which is still more evident, in that the Seventh Head is the last, under which the Beast perisheth together with that Head, as that Elliptical Text doth certainly imply, chap. 17. 11. the entire sense whereof is this, <hi>And the Beast that was, and is not,</hi> even his Head is <hi>the Eighth, and is one of the Seven; and he</hi> together with his Head <hi>goes into perdition:</hi> as I shall have occasion more fully to note in its due place.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore it is reasonable to conceive that the first Head reaches to the first beginning of the Beast, that is, of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, as well as the last to its destruction. Nor will I adde, that <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> connoting the Roman Empire as well as the Devil, may also connote the antiquity of the one as well as of the other.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Fifthly and lastly, That the <hi>Seven-headed Beast represents the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire no further then as Idolatrous,</hi> (which is the last part of our Assertion) will appear from this, That this Prophetick Image or <hi>Iconism</hi> of <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> or <hi>Fera</hi> is not used for the Representation of any Empire but

                           <pb n="272" facs="tcp:42932:152"/>
what is <hi>Idolatrous,</hi> as I have already intimated: and therefore if it should stand for a Kingdom or Empire while it is not Idolatrous, it would be like a false affirmation in words, and prove an Emblematical slander. The <hi>names of Blasphemy</hi> also <hi>on his Heads</hi> and <hi>on his Body</hi> make this <hi>Seven-headed Beast</hi> still more inept to represent any Kingdom while it stands free from Idolatry; I mean, the Life and Being of the Beast is thus inept.</p>
                        <p>But the slaughter of the Beast, or extermination of him out of Being, may signifie that an Empire that was <hi>Idolatrous,</hi> and consequently, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Prophetick style, a <hi>Beast,</hi> ceases to be so still: And consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> as an <hi>Empire,</hi> has not yet ceased to be, but that it did cease to be Idolatrous upon <hi>Constantine</hi> his turning Christian, it is manifest that the Beast's being slain or ceasing to be is to be understood of that state of the Empire. For from <hi>Constantine</hi>'s time till the entrance again of <hi>Idolatry</hi> into the Empire, the Beast in life and being was an inept Emblem thereof, and, as I said, a mere Hieroglyphick slander.</p>
                        <p>But as the slain Beast, during the time it lies slain, comprises in it all the time of the Empire's pure Christianity: so the Beast as yet not slain, as also after the slaughter again restored to life, comprises all that tract of time of the Roman Kingdom or Empire's Idolatry, as well that before as that after the flourishing of pure Christianity in it. Which is another plain discovery of the truth of the fourth part of our Assertion.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. It is abundantly plain therefore from what we have alledged, <hi>That the Beast with seven Heads and ten Horns signifies the Idolatrous Roman Kingdom or Empire</hi> quatenus <hi>Idolatrous,</hi> that is to say, <hi>when and so long as Idolatrous, and no longer.</hi> Which is one considerable Argument to evince that the <hi>Seven Heads</hi> of the Beast are <hi>not Seven single Persons suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding one another,</hi> but <hi>Seven sorts of Supreme Governours.</hi> For what seven Persons can fill out the time of the duration of the Empire while Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous, and not leave it many hundreds, if not above a thousand years, destitute of Sovereign Power, and so make it a Beast living so many Ages without an Head? then which nothing can be more absurd.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. But this is not our onely Argument, though it alone may seem suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to prove our main <hi>Thesis.</hi> For it may be farther confirmed by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting on the nature and description of these <hi>Seven Heads:</hi> for what they are set out by ought to be conceived as a character to distinguish them from all other Heads of the Beast (if there be any besides them) that are omitted, and to denote that these thus characterized are all that are of this character. And therefore whenas these <hi>Seven Heads</hi> are said to have <hi>Seven Crowns</hi> upon them, (were it not to distinguish them from the Seven Hills to which <hi>Crowns</hi> are not so proper) I should demand of them that make these seven Heads seven Roman Emperours, if there were but seven Roman Emperours crowned. But I have already answered my own demand, by acknowledging that the <hi>seven Heads</hi> bear <hi>seven Crowns,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the sense in that place to such Objects as it is proper to wear Crowns, namely, Seven Kings; and that the phancy may make no divaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the <hi>Seven Hills.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But whereas in the following Chapter these Seven Heads (for that they are the same that fought with <hi>Michael,</hi> appears in that one of them is
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:42932:152"/>
represented as wounded in the battel) are said to have inscribed upon them <hi>the Name of Blasphemy,</hi> that is to say, of <hi>Idolatry;</hi> here I seriously demand, if there were no more then <hi>Seven Blasphemous</hi> or <hi>Idolatrous Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours</hi> in the whole Roman Succession. And I dare answer, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the consent of our Adversaries, that there were. And that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Seven single Emperours</hi> cannot be understood by these <hi>Seven Heads,</hi> but <hi>Seven sorts of Governours.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="10">10. To which in the second place you may adde, That as in ordinary speech by a two-footed Animal is understood an Animal that has two feet and no more; as also in a four-footed Animal, four feet and no more: so by this <hi>Seven-headed Beast</hi> is naturally to be understood a <hi>Beast that has Seven Heads and no more;</hi> it being so <note n="*" place="margin">All Seven crowned, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 12. one of the Seven woun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Which cannot be true of the Roman Idolatrous Empire, unless <hi>Seven sorts of Governours,</hi> not that number of Persons, be understood. For <hi>seven single Persons</hi> in the whole tract of the Empire's continuance will make no better show then a tuft of seven bristles on the back of the <hi>Calydonian Boar;</hi> which can neither be pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nor called the <hi>Boar with seven Bristles,</hi> when there is a whole row or ridge of these setaceous prickles of the same nature with them that are either mentioned or depainted.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. Lastly, The Beast (as appears plainly from the Text) was slain under the Sixth Head, because the slaughter of him is a Prediction by S. <hi>John,</hi> who himself lived while the Sixth Head was in being, and the last Head is the Head of his restoring or reviving; and there are but <hi>Seven Heads</hi> in all. Wherefore it is plain that the Beast was slain under the Sixth Head. Nor could the last Head be said to be the Head of the <hi>Beast that was, and is not, and yet is,</hi> if it had started up before the Beast was slain or before he was restored. Wherefore it is plain that his slaughter was under the Sixth, as it is also that the Beast revived has but one Head from the commencement of his restauration to his final perdition; for there are but <hi>Seven Heads</hi> in all.</p>
                        <p>But now the <hi>slaying of the Beast</hi> or <hi>making of him cease to be,</hi> it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest that it was the Introduction of Christianity instead of Paganism into the Empire, and of the Christian Emperours into the place of the Pagan <hi>Caesars:</hi> the continuance of which state of things is said to be but <note n="*" place="margin">Revel. 17.</note> 
                           <hi>a little while</hi> in comparison of this succeeding or reviving Beast. (For the preceding Head is nothing to our present purpose.) But that <hi>little while</hi> there is none will say was so little as to be concluded within the reign of one Christian Emperour, and therefore must signify a Succession of Emperours purely Christian.</p>
                        <p>Much more therefore must the <hi>Seventh Head</hi> (which is also called the <hi>Eighth King,</hi> but amongst the Heads is as well the Last as the Seventh) signify a Succession, it being to continue much longer. But for those that make the return of Idolatry into the Empire more late or not yet, how long will the reign of that Beast <hi>that was, and is not, and yet is,</hi> be found in their compute? If the <hi>little while</hi> be already thirteen hundred years, how many thousands must the reign of the revived Beast be? So impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is it that the <hi>Seventh</hi> or Last <hi>Head</hi> should be understood of any <hi>single</hi>
                           <pb n="274" facs="tcp:42932:153"/>
                           <hi>Person,</hi> but of a Succession; unless they will have a Beast live some thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of years without an Head.</p>
                        <p>But if the <hi>Seventh</hi> or <hi>Last Head</hi> signify a Succession of Supreme Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of such a kind, and not one single Person, then must the other Six also signify six sorts of Governours, not six persons, as any one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced will easily acknowledge.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. Which Conclusion was worth the searching into; the firmly establishing it so plainly evincing, that such an Interpretation as implies <hi>That the Seven Heads are Seven successions of different sorts of Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,</hi> is not onely fit and agreeing to the Text, but necessary, and that all other Interpretations that run upon <hi>Seven persons</hi> are not onely false but impossible.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. Now out of what we have concluded it is further manifest what is the main <hi>Subject of this Vision in this Seventeenth Chapter</hi> of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calyps,</hi> namely, <hi>That it is not the Roman Empire purely Pagan;</hi> for that had passed under the <hi>Five</hi> first Heads, and was passing away under the <hi>Sixth</hi> in S. <hi>John</hi>'s time. Which <hi>Sixth</hi> Head together with the Beast was slain and ceased to be upon the Roman Empire's receiving Christianity, and the Emperours becoming Christians, and the Christian Religion continuing untainted with Idolatry. For while that was, (and it was so once) the Beast ceased to be. But the Beast exhibited to S. <hi>John</hi> in this Vision is <hi>the Beast that was, and then ceased to be, but after was to be again, and then was utterly to be destroyed.</hi> Which Notes all put together are onely competible to the Beast upon his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary ceasing to be, and is a Name given to him with regard to that time of his temporary cessation, for then was all that true of him; and is a proper Characteristick of his nature and order of succession.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore it is plain that the Subject of this Vision is the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire again revived into Idolatry, and so to continue till the final extirpation of Idolatry out of it: Which is the utter Perdition of the Beast, and the making of him cease to be for ever; as the exterminating of Idolatry out of the Empire for a time was the deadly wounding or killing the Beast for a time, but so as that he revived again in a very lively Image of himself.</p>
                        <p n="14">14. From whence it will also follow, That the <hi>Whore of Babylon</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be understood of <hi>Rome Pagan,</hi> but of Rome <hi>Pagano-Christian,</hi> or of the <hi>Roman Hierarchy</hi> (taking <hi>Roman</hi> in the largest sense) corrupting Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity with the illicite Doctrines and practices of Idolatry. For how can <hi>Rome Pagan</hi> that past under the first Six Heads sit upon <hi>the Beast that was, and is not, and yet is;</hi> that is to say, upon that Beast that had no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence before pure Christianity had become the Religion of the Empire, but was afterwards to succeed that State, as a sad Corruption thereof, under the Seventh Head?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Rome Pagan</hi> therefore sate upon the Beast under the succession of the <hi>Six</hi> first Heads onely. At which onely time it could rightly be said of the Beast, and simply, <hi>That he is.</hi> But the incorrupted Christianity being once made the Religion of the Empire, at that time it might rightly be said, <hi>That the Beast was, but is not,</hi> but that he was again to ascend out
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:42932:153"/>
of the Abyss, and then after a certain considerable duration of time utterly to perish. But during the time of that corrupted Condition, when Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion became <hi>Paganish</hi> and <hi>Idolatrous,</hi> it might rightly be said of the Empire then, <hi>That it is the Beast that was, and is not, and yet is.</hi> But the <hi>Whore</hi> is said to ride this very Beast. Wherefore it is <hi>not ancient Rome,</hi> but the <hi>Pagano-Christian</hi> Harlot, or the <hi>Roman Hierarchy,</hi> which is the <hi>Whore</hi> that rides the Beast in this Vision.</p>
                        <p n="15">15. Nor can the Vision be understood of <hi>Paganism</hi> grosly so termed, that should again over-run the Roman Empire a little before the End of the World under a <hi>Chimaerical Antichrist</hi> then to appear, (as some are willing to phansy for a shuffle;) but is to be interpreted of an <hi>Antichristianism</hi> that has already seized it; forasmuch as it is said, that the truly Christian Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sars shall continue but <note n="*" place="margin">Revel. 17.</note> 
                           <hi>a short time.</hi> Which implies that the Antichristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an State will continue a long time in comparison thereof.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore if this Antichristian State is not come, but all is well, and that <hi>Pagano-Christian</hi> Idolatry has not entred from the reign of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> to this very day; the Reign of Antichrist will be at least three or four thousand years long: Which is so monstrous a consequence, and so point-blank contrary to Scripture, that the Position must be necessarily false that infers it.</p>
                        <p n="16">16. Wherefore we may safely conclude, <hi>That the main Subject of the Vision</hi> in this 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter of the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> as also of that in the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> (which is in a manner the very same with this) <hi>is the State of the Roman Empire corrupted and degenerated from the true and pure Christianity into a Paganish and Idolatrous condition,</hi> by reason of the false direction and guidance of those of the Roman Hierarchy that took upon them to rule the Empire in matters of Religion: But withall, That this <hi>Idolatrous</hi> condition both in the Hierarchy and Empire after a certain Period of time shall be changed, and true Christianity overflow all again, and Idolatry never again revive.</p>
                        <p>This is the Summary Account of these Visions. We will now fall upon the Exposition of every Particular of each Chapter, whereby this general Account may be still more convincingly demonstrated.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. IN this Joint-Exposition, though I shall not be wanting in other Particulars, my main drift shall be to note out and confirm the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the two Parallelisms I have above delineated. And for brevity sake, without any farther Analyse, I shall guide my Exposition by the Order of the Verses of the Seventeenth Chapter, passing from verse to verse, and comparing those out of the Thirteenth which I have subjoined, with what is comprized in each Verse of the Seventeenth, accordingly as I have above intimated.</p>
                        <p>Ver. I. <hi>The Judgment of the Great Whore that sitteth upon many waters.</hi> The <hi>Judgment</hi> or <hi>Condemnation of the Great Whore,</hi> the Punishment to which she is sentenced, is a special part of this Vision, and therefore bears the Title of the whole. I need not here insist upon what I have so fully instructed my Reader in, in my Doctrine of the <hi>Prophetick Schemes;</hi> How in the Prophetick style a <hi>Body Politick</hi> or a <hi>Multitude of Persons</hi> and their <hi>Succession</hi> is represented under <hi>one Individual shew</hi> or <hi>shape,</hi> whether <hi>Belluine</hi> or <hi>Humane:</hi> which Scheme we called <hi>Henopoeia.</hi> And <note place="margin">Ch. 3. Sect. 7.</note> therefore he will easily understand that the <hi>Whore</hi> is no single or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Woman, but a Type of a <hi>Body Politick,</hi> which being called a <hi>Whore,</hi> implies their <hi>Idolatrousness,</hi> as I have abundantly made good in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of that <hi>Icasme</hi> in my <hi>Prophetick Alphabet.</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Ch. 9. Sect. 9.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. And that she is said to be that <hi>Great Whore,</hi> it may either signify the <hi>height of her Whoredom,</hi> or the <hi>extent of her Jurisdiction;</hi> the latter whereof is agreeable to her being placed <hi>upon many waters.</hi> The Greek has it, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                           </gap> seems to be demonstrative and emphaticall, pointing at the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. For that is <hi>those many waters</hi> indeed, a great Sea or Ocean, in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick style. Whence I conceive the <hi>Great Whore</hi> to be the <hi>Roman Hierarchy</hi> in a larger sense, understanding thereby the <hi>whole Body of the Idolatrous Clergy throughout the Roman Empire:</hi> though I do not doubt but that this imputation will more notoriously concern one part then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, more the <hi>Roman</hi> then the <hi>Greek</hi> Church; and then especially when the <hi>Bishop of Rome</hi> had once got the Title of <hi>Universal Bishop,</hi> he in a more peculiar manner entitling himself thereby to all the foul miscarriages of the Catholick Church.</p>
                        <p n="3">
                           <pb n="277" facs="tcp:42932:154"/>
3. And that the Vision of the <hi>Two-horned Beast</hi> does also imply such an universal Idolatrous Corruption in the Clergie, as well in the <hi>Oriental</hi> as <note place="margin">Par. 1. Agr. 7.</note> in the <hi>Occidental</hi> parts of the Empire, is intimated in the <hi>Two horns</hi> of that Beast, as also in <hi>exercising all the power of the former Beast in his sight,</hi> which I will defer to speak of till we come to the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verse of this present Chapter. I shall onely take notice before I pass any farther, that I have in the foregoing Chapter proved by a method plainly Demonstrative, That this <hi>Great Whore</hi> is not to be understood of any Body Politick that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted Idolatry while the Empire was Pagan, but after it became and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Christian, though contaminated with a <hi>Pagan-like</hi> Idolatry of a new Fashion; which I have proved to have been many Ages already in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, according to the evident sense of this Prophecy. So that there can be no rub nor scruple as concerning this.</p>
                        <p>Ver. II. <hi>With whom the Kings of the Earth have committed Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> That is to say, By whose allurements and perswasions the Kings of the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> (which is called <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> 
                           <hi>the inhabited Earth,</hi> Luke 2.) have admitted and embraced Idolatrous doctrines and practices, which is Spiritual Whoredome. Haply the <hi>Ten Kings</hi> may be alluded to which are mentioned v. 13. and are said <hi>to have one minde, and to give their power and strength to the Beast,</hi> which the <hi>Whore</hi> rides. <hi>And the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> that is to say, The people of the Empire were so inflamed, intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated and dementated with the unwholsom heat of Idolatrous zeal, that it made them very tragically quarrelsom against all Opposers or Despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers of their fair <hi>Diana;</hi> and made them so sottish, secure and heedless, that they were exposed to all the deceits and injuries this intoxicating <hi>Circe</hi> could put upon them.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Now as this <hi>Great Whore</hi> is said to be such a Promoter or Restorer of Idolatry: so likewise is the <hi>Two-horned Beast;</hi> which though he have <hi>two horns like a Lamb,</hi> yet is said <hi>to speak like a Dragon,</hi> that is, to publish <note place="margin">Paral. 1. Agr. 1.</note> Idolatrous Edicts or Doctrines. And again v. 12. he is said to <hi>cause the Earth and them that dwell therein,</hi> that is, the Empire, (as I said before) <hi>to worship the first Beast whose deadly wound was healed:</hi> And v. 14. <hi>to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them that dwell on the Earth, that they should make an Image to the Beast who had the wound by the sword, and did live.</hi> The sense of the latter of which citations is this, That the <hi>Two-horned Beast</hi> by his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and power of speech perswaded them of the Empire, which was now purely Christian, (and was therefore the death of the Beast, as I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated in the fore-going Chapter) to introduce such a face of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry again, (though upon pretence of the better adorning and promoting Christianity) that the slain Beast might justly seem to <hi>revive</hi> again in this <hi>Image,</hi> that is to say, that the Empire might be said to become a Beast again by becoming Idolatrous, as the death of the Beast was the Empire's ceasing from Idolatry. And therefore to make an <hi>Image to</hi> the Beast that was slain, is as much as to make an <hi>Image in the behalf</hi> of the Beast that was slain; that he might at least live again in this <hi>Image.</hi> And it is said in the very Text, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

Wherefore it is no wonder that this <hi>Two-horned Beast</hi> is said <hi>to make them that dwell on the Earth to worship the first Beast whose deadly wound was healed,</hi> when he was the Healer and Reviver of him, and put him in a capacity of being <hi>worshipped,</hi> that is, <hi>obeyed,</hi> as I have noted in my Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabet, and that in such Injunctions as were Impious and Idolatrous. For this <hi>Pagano-Christianism</hi> becoming the Religion of the Empire, it was made thereby the Law and Commandment of the Empire, so that the healed Beast may be rightly said to be <hi>obeyed</hi> in the submission thereto. Out of all which does plainly appear, That the <hi>Two-horned Beast</hi> as well as the <hi>Whore of Babylon</hi> was a Restorer and Promoter of Idolatry in the Empire.</p>
                        <p>Ver. III. <hi>So he carried me away in the Spirit into the wilderness.</hi> This is no part of the Vision, unless we make <hi>Wilderness</hi> Hieroglyphical. And indeed <hi>Alcazar</hi> from the authority of many of the Fathers makes it a Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bole of <hi>Gentilism.</hi> But whether you consider the Type or no, this <hi>Two-horned</hi>

                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

So that it had not been inept to have made this one Agreement in our first Parallelism.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>And I saw a Woman sit upon a scarlet-coloured Beast.</hi> The sitting upon a Beast implies the riding and guiding of him, the exciting and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of him to this or that course, as the Rider pleases. And the <hi>Two-hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Beast</hi> is said likewise to animate the <hi>Seven-headed Beast,</hi> and to prick <note place="margin">Paral. 1. Agr. 2.</note> him up to those bloudy Edicts that seem to be alluded to Chap. 13. v. 15. That the revived Beast should speak, and cause as many as will not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to him <hi>as Beast,</hi> that is to say, <hi>as Idolatrous,</hi> to be slain. And this may suffice for an intimation of the truth of the second Agreement of the first Parallelism; That as well the <hi>Whore,</hi> as the <hi>Two-horned Beast,</hi> has the governance and rule over the Beast with seven Heads.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Now for the <hi>scarlet colour</hi> of the Beast, it has a double indication; the one of <hi>Tyrannical Cruelty,</hi> the other of <hi>Imperial Majesty.</hi> In the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <note place="margin">Paral. 2. Agr. 2.</note> sense <hi>Victorinus, Aretas, Zegerus, Viegas, Alcazar</hi> and others inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret it. In the latter <hi>Cornelius à Lapide, Paraeus, Ribera</hi> and <hi>Grotius. Fera coccinea,</hi> (saith he) <hi>nimirum quia eo colore tingi solebant Imperato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Romanorum Paludamenta.</hi> But where both senses are so fit, they are both to be understood by an <hi>Henopoeia,</hi> which reduces many Objects pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured, under one Type. But for the present I shall onely take notice of the <hi>Cruelty</hi> of the Beast set out by this bloudy colour. And the like is also figured in the shape of the <hi>Seven-headed Beast</hi> in the Thirteenth Chapter: <hi>His body</hi> there being like that of a <hi>Leopard, his feet</hi> like a <hi>Bear</hi>'s, and <hi>his mouth</hi> like a <hi>Lion</hi>'s. All which are Beasts of great Rapine and Cruelty.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. <hi>Full of names of Blasphemy,</hi> that is, Full of Titles or Kinds of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry. <hi>Plenam Diis,</hi> so <hi>Grotius,</hi> understanding it of the Pagan Empire; and we may safely render it, <hi>full of Daemons,</hi> in Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s sense, that is, full of the superstitious and Idolatrous worship of the Souls of the Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, (besides other Idolatries committed in the manner of worshipping
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:42932:155"/>
the due Object of our Religion, God and Christ) since the Empire has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>Pagano-Christian.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Nor is the Beast in the Thirteenth Chapter less remarkable for this foul sin. For as the <hi>Scarlet</hi> Beast was full of <hi>names of blasphemy,</hi> dappled as it <note place="margin">Par. 2. Agr. 2.</note> were with those black Titles; so <hi>Grotius</hi> makes the <hi>Leopard</hi> spotted with various objects of Idolatry. <hi>Pardalis varii coloris animal; sic Idolola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tria Romana Deos habebat mares, foeminas, mari-foeminas, maximos, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dioximos, minimos, vario vultu, vario habitu, variâ potestate.</hi> And does the <hi>Pagano-Christian Idolatry</hi> fall any thing short? Has it not its He-Saints and She-Saints, to which they give Religious worship? Do they not profess a <hi>Dulia</hi> and <hi>Hyperdulia,</hi> as well as <hi>Latria?</hi> which bids fair towards the Heathens <hi>Dii Minimi</hi> and <hi>Medioximi.</hi> Has it not some Saints famous for inflicting particular mischiefs, and others for doing this or that particular good? some Saints of one aspect and dress, and others of another? Have not some one office, and others another? as shall be seen more punctually hereafter.</p>
                        <p>But the <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> that is, the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of this Beast is more copiously recorded and more expresly v. 5. <hi>And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies;</hi> that is to say, an Authority de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeing gross Idolatries to the reproach of the living God; <hi>whose name</hi> he is said <hi>to blaspheme,</hi> in the following verse, <hi>and his Tabernacle, and them that dwell in Heaven.</hi> To <hi>blaspheme God,</hi> viz. by worshipping him by <hi>Images,</hi> or by giving <hi>Religious</hi> worship to others which is onely due to him, and thereby vilifying him and making him no better then a Creature. <hi>To blaspheme the Tabernacle of God,</hi> that is, the Body of Christ, <hi>in whom the fulness of the Godhead dwelleth bodily,</hi> (as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle speaketh) by pretending that a piece of Bread, which they put into <note place="margin">See my <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Antichrist.</hi> Book 2. Ch. 5. Sect. 2, 3.</note> that foul prison whither a mans phancy is loath to descend, is the very Body of Christ, even that Body so full of stupendious glory: which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly is wretchedly eclipsed, while a morsel of Bread is avowed to be really it, and is adored towards accordingly. And, lastly, <hi>To blaspheme them that dwell in Heaven,</hi> namely the Saints, by declaring they are so ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious <note place="margin">See <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristianism,</hi> Book 1. Ch. 16. Sect. 2.</note> and rebellious against God, that they do not onely accept, but would extort Religious worship from men by deaths and imprisonments, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious pressures and afflictions, which this bloudy Beast does execute against the sincere members of Christ, having first branded them with the odious Nick-name of <hi>Hereticks;</hi> pretending herein their Zeal and Honour to the Saints, while they are really by these courses very highly reproached and blasphemed as cruel and inhumane against men, as well as rebellious and treacherous against God. So wonderfully true and significant is this Character of <hi>Blasphemy</hi> upon the Beast, and so plainly have we made out the second Agreement of the second Parallelism.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. <hi>Having seven Heads and ten Horns.</hi> So Chap. 13. <hi>And I saw a Beast rise up out of the Sea, having seven Heads and ten Horns.</hi> Which <note place="margin">Par. 2. Agr <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                              </gap>.</note> is a palpable evidence of the first Agreement of our second Parallelism. What is meant by these <hi>seven Heads</hi> and <hi>ten Horns</hi> we shall understand anon.</p>
                        <p>Ver. IV. <hi>And the Woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and</hi>
                           <pb n="280" facs="tcp:42932:156"/>
                           <hi>decked with gold and precious stones and pearls.</hi> That <hi>Purple</hi> and <hi>Scarlet</hi> is an Imperial colour, we have already noted, and is here again allowed by <hi>Grotius</hi> on this 4. verse. But here it is seasonable to observe, That as the Beast, which is the whole Roman Empire, was allowed to be called a <hi>Scarlet Beast,</hi> though that Wear was peculiar to the Heads of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, I mean the Emperours themselves or the Senate; so this <hi>Whore</hi> may be said <hi>to be arrayed in purple and scarlet</hi> (that is, the Roman Hierarchy or whole Body of that Clergy) though this colour should belong onely to the Head, or at least those higher Governours of this Body next to this chief Head. And such are the Robes and Habits of the Roman <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals,</hi> as is well known. And for the <hi>Gold and precious Stones and Pearls,</hi> it does plainly refer to the Pope's <hi>Triple Crown of Gold</hi> glistering with rich <hi>gemms</hi> and <hi>precious stones,</hi> as also to the <hi>pearls</hi> of his rich Cope, &amp;c. Which shews that this Vision hath a more peculiar regard to the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> properly so called, though it may cast a lighter glance on the whole Idolatrous Clergy of the Empire.</p>
                        <p>But this Head of the <hi>Roman</hi> Hierarchy with his <hi>purple</hi> Cardinals are so <hi>Emperour-like</hi> and of such a <hi>Senatorious</hi> splendour, that it is manifest that there is an affectation of <hi>Imperial</hi> power in the Pope himself; his Crown and Vestments being so plainly <hi>Imperial.</hi> And though the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the Beast and the Seventh Head distinct from this Mitred Head implies there is an Emperour to be acknowledged distinct from the Pope; yet this Hieroglyphick does plainly signifie that the Pope does play the Emperour as well or more then he. Which does admirably agree with the known event of things, and is plainly foretold also in the 13. Chap. v. 12. <hi>And he exerciseth all the power of the first Beast before him,</hi> that <note place="margin">Par. 1. Agr. 3.</note> is to say, He plays the Emperour as much or more then He. Which must be understood of this <hi>Two-horned Beast</hi> most especially as residing at <hi>Old Rome,</hi> who timely challenged the right of <hi>Universal Bishop,</hi> and had it early conferred upon him by the bounty of <hi>Phocas</hi> the Emperour; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter so out-topp'd the Emperours, that he made himself greater then they: though I do not stick to confess with <hi>Grotius,</hi> that neither they nor their Empire has yet ceased to be, accordingly as the Prophecie it self may seem to testifie, there being a Seventh Head of this Beast distinct from the Head of the <hi>Two-horned Beast</hi> or the <hi>Whore.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. But that this <hi>Two-horned Beast,</hi> viz. the chief and most eminent part of him, does <hi>exercise all the power of the first Beast before him,</hi> is to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration <note place="margin">Par. 1. Agr. 3.</note> fulfilled in the Pope's playing the Emperour: As in wearing not onely a single Mirre as <hi>Bishop,</hi> but a <hi>Triple Imperial Diadem</hi> as if he were <hi>Emperour.</hi> His purple Vestments also and crimson pantofles; his Title of <hi>Dominus Deus noster;</hi> his Senate of purpurate Cardinals; his making Kings and Princes kiss his feet; his receiving Tribute even from the remotest parts of the Empire; his Canonizing of Saints with the joint suffrages of the Cardinals; his sending of his Legats to Princes; his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue out of Stews, &amp;c. (of which and others of the like nature you may be informed more punctually in <note n="*" place="margin">
                              <hi>Molin.</hi> Var. Lib 5. c. 17.</note> 
                           <hi>Molinaeus)</hi> all these were imitations of the <hi>Imperial</hi> Power and Dignity. So exactly may he be said to <hi>exercise all the power of the first Beast before him.</hi>
                        </p>

                           <pb n="281" facs="tcp:42932:156"/>
And is yet still more palpably true, in that he takes away all power in <hi>Ecclesiastick</hi> affairs from the Emperour, and will exercise it solely himself: not to adde that by virtue of this entire <hi>Ecclesiastick Power</hi> he has wrested even the <hi>Civil Power</hi> of the Empire out of the Emperour's hands in a very great measure; so awful a thing has been the Pope's thunder of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication.</hi> And this is sufficient to make good the third Agreement of my first Parallelism.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>Having a golden Cup in her hand, full of abominations and filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of her fornications.</hi> Where <hi>Grotius</hi> upon the word <hi>Abominations,</hi>

                           </gap>. And therefore the <hi>filthiness of her Fornications</hi> is the same with the former, they all signifying the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Hierarchy. And as we have already demonstrated in the foregoing Chapter, that this <hi>Whore</hi> is not understood of <hi>Rome Pagan,</hi> so this Circumstance amongst others agrees very naturally thereto. For this Woman with her <hi>Cup in her hand</hi> implies she is the beginner, not of an health, but of this damnable Pollution of Idolatry; and that, whereas the Empire had grown chast and cold to this folly and madness through the power of the pure Gospel of Christ, this Woman by this Incentive, this <hi>Virus amatorium,</hi> would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame their spirits again with new lustful motions after Idols, and make them goe a-whoring from their God.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. But there is something further observable in this <hi>golden Cup,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the force of its bewitchery may consist. For that it is an <hi>enchanted Cup</hi> or a <hi>Philtrum,</hi> I have abundantly made good under that Title in my <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick Alphabet;</hi> and not onely Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> but <hi>Cornelius à Lapide</hi> and <note place="margin">Cha. 8.

                           <hi>Alcazar</hi> interpret it to that sense. The latter of whom besides the filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Composition, as the ashes of Toads and of mens brains hanged at the Gallows, addes also <hi>Cantiones &amp; execranda verba,</hi> Charms and direful words: which must needs therefore be conceived to be <hi>Magical</hi> and of a miraculous power. Analogical to which is that Chap. 13. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <note place="margin">V. 13. 14.</note> the <hi>Two-horned Beast,</hi> that <hi>he doth great wonders, even so much that he maketh fire to come down from Heaven, and so deceiveth them</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Par. 1. Agr. 4.</note> 
                           <hi>that dwell on the Earth by those miracles that he had power to doe in the sight of the Beast;</hi> that is to say, in the sight of the Empire which he se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into Idolatry by these Miracles, and so re-introduced the Image of the slain Beast by this seduction. Whence it is plain, That the <hi>Magick</hi> and the <hi>Miracles</hi> of the <hi>Whore</hi> and of the <hi>Two-horned Beast</hi> tended to one end, the reviving of Idolatry again in the Empire, according to the fourth Agreement of our first Parallelism.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. But one chief Charm that was used over this <hi>Magical Cup</hi> undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly are those powerful and affrightful words of <hi>Excommunication,</hi> that Menace of committing men to Hell-fire, if they did not submit to these Idolatrous Institutes of the Church. This Thunder from that Roman <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jovis</hi> did not sowre but sweeten this Cup, and make it goe off with a great deal of pleasure; it looking so like the <hi>Cup of salvation</hi> to those that drank it, when it was so authoritatively and terribly declared that those that refused it should undoubtedly perish. This is that main <hi>Spell</hi> that did
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:42932:157"/>
invigorate the virtue of this Potion, and made the Whore's Paramours lie more close in her bosom, when they were terrified with such ineffable danger and misery that should befall them out of it. Which pretended power being neither lawful nor natural, but above the limits of Nature, what can it be justly deemed but <hi>Magical</hi> or <hi>Diabolical?</hi> And this is that very same power which is plainly and apertly figured out in those words of the 13 Chapter, where the <hi>Two-horned Beast</hi> is said <hi>to make fire come down from Heaven:</hi> which I have already, in my <hi>Prophetick Alphabet,</hi> plainly <note place="margin">Chap. 6. Sect. 14.</note> proved to be a very significant <hi>Iconism</hi> of <hi>Excommunication.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">6. And there is nothing more frequent in the mouths of all men then the <hi>Pope's Thunderbolt;</hi> of which they have conceived so miraculous an effect, that the people at <hi>Paris</hi> were made generally to believe that it had so blasted the Hereticks, that their very faces were grown black and ugly as Devils, their eyes and looks ghastly, their breaths noisom and pestilent, as Sir <hi>Edwin Sandys</hi> has recorded in his <hi>Europae Speculum. Eras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> also runs much upon this Metaphor in his Colloquies, and the Popes themselves glory in it. And as if the people were not quick enough to understand the similitude without some visible Ceremonie, the Pope casts down <hi>burning Fire-brands</hi> from aloft at a certain solemn <hi>Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi> And, lastly, <hi>Nauclerus</hi> uses this phrase of being thus <hi>Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struck</hi> three or four times within the compass of a page or two. And the Popes themselves look upon them whom they have Excommunicated <hi>tanquam fulmine afflatos,</hi> and so speak of them, as <hi>Paraeus</hi> has also ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served upon the place. So that there is not room left for the least Hesita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whether <hi>Excommunication</hi> be not alluded to in that miraculous <hi>bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down fire from Heaven.</hi>
                        </p>

But whereas it is said, <hi>That he deceiveth them that dwell on the Earth by reason of those Miracles which he had power to doe;</hi> I must confess I think <hi>other Miracles</hi> may also be glanced at, of which there is abundance boasted of by the <hi>Roman</hi> Church themselves, by which they would confirm se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral sorts of Idolatries practised amongst them. Which may be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted, as many of them as are true, to the great activity and desire of their Priests to promote Idolatry, who thereby invite the Devil to play such pranks at their Images or Altars or in their Coemeteries.

                           <hi>Cornelius à Lapide</hi> has also compared them: and it is the <hi>Great City</hi> there too which is so called.

With which certainly so profound and venerable a Preface as <hi>[Mystery]</hi> cannot well suit.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Wherefore it must be understood of a <hi>Christian City or Polity Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrizing</hi> and debauching others with Idolatry. And the meaning of the <hi>Mystery</hi> must be this: Even that that Hierarchy which should over-spread the Empire, &amp; pretend to be the pure and unadulterate Apostolick Church, and be generally believed to be so; nay, to be <hi>that City from Heaven, the foundations of whose Walls are twelve, with the names of the twelve Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles of the Lamb inscribed upon them; that City wherein God will wipe away all tears from the eyes of his servants, where there shall be no more death nor sorrow nor crying, nor any more pain,</hi> that is to say, no more bloudy Persecutions, Pressures nor Tortures of the faithful Servants of Christ, as <hi>Grotius</hi> well interprets it; and, lastly, <hi>that City wherein there is no Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> that is to say, no Object towards which we bow, besides the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb, who alone is worshipped with Religious worship; I say, the <hi>Mystery</hi> is this, That that <hi>Occumenical Hierarchy</hi> or Body of the Clergie that boast themselves to be this pure and Apostolick City, as being of an unerring judgment, should indeed be the very City <hi>Babylon</hi> it self, which in stead of being so chast a pattern of Purity of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, were <hi>Sacrificers to the dead,</hi> and the Adorers or <hi>Worshippers of Bel,</hi> and the Propagators of the worship of the <hi>Baalim,</hi> that is to say, of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:42932:158"/>
of <hi>Daemons</hi> or <hi>false Gods,</hi> through the world, infecting therewith even the very <hi>Jews</hi> themselves, the peculiar people of God; and in stead of being a Protection and Refreshment to the Servants of the true God, held them in a long and sad Captivity, casting them that would not bow to the Image that <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> had set up into an hot fiery Furnace. This is the <hi>Mystery,</hi> and yet a very true one.</p>
                        <p>For it is over-manifest of this Pseudo-christian Hierarchy, that they have debauched the professed People of God with various kinds of Idolatry, and have held them captive a long time under an hard servitude, and besides other tortures and persecutions have burned thousands of the faithful ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Christ with Fire and Fagot. Wherefore it is a <hi>Mystery</hi> indeed that she that so boldly professes her self the <hi>City of God,</hi> and had the luck to be believed, so generally, to be so, should in truth be found to be that <hi>bloudy</hi> and <hi>Idolatrous Babylon.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. And because she boasts her self also to be the <hi>Catholick</hi> as well as the <hi>Apostolick Church,</hi> she is farther adorned with the Title of <hi>Great</hi> as well as of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and is at once styled <hi>Babylon the Great;</hi> the vast extent of that City (which they that have made the most frugal computation reckon 360 or 380 <hi>Stadia</hi> in compass, <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Herodotus</hi> 480) being a fit Symbol of their pretence to <hi>Catholickness</hi> or <hi>Universality.</hi> And, lastly, because she will pretend to be the <hi>Spouse of the Lamb,</hi> and be called <hi>Our Mother the Church,</hi> the Spirit of God in reproach to this false Beast has styled her the <hi>Mother of Harlots and Abominations of the Earth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">5. Which style does plainly discover that this City <hi>Babylon</hi> is not <hi>Rome Heathen,</hi> but a <hi>Polity Christian.</hi> For <hi>Rome Heathen</hi> was not <gap reason="foreign">

Which lying deeper then that every man can discover it at first sight, as being co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured and gilded over with fair pretences of magnifying Christ and his Apostles and the rest of the Saints, especially the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> the Mother of Christ, is rightly called a <hi>Mystery.</hi> In which this <hi>Whore</hi> and the <hi>Two-horned</hi>

                           <hi>Beast</hi> do exactly agree. For his <hi>having Horns like a Lamb</hi> is that outward pretext of Succession from Christ and his Apostles, and of having a power from them to rule and discipline the Church according to

                        <p>Ver.

No, these were the close followers of the Lamb, <hi>Jesus</hi> Christ, and trode in his footsteps onely, and in the footsteps of them that faithfully followed him, I mean the Apostles, according to their own direction, <hi>Be ye followers of me, as I am of Christ.</hi> And him they did follow through prosperity and adversity, through good report and <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 1.</note> evil report, through life and death it self.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Whose <hi>Death</hi> is imputed here to the <hi>Whore,</hi> because she by her counsel and animation stirs up the <hi>Seven-headed Beast</hi> to this Murther and Bloud-shed. Accordingly as it is said of the <hi>Two-horned Beast,</hi> that he gave life and animation to this revived Beast, and made this breathing Image speak, and cause as many as would not <hi>worship,</hi> that is, <hi>obey</hi> and submit to the commands of the Image of the Beast, even in those things wherein it was the slain Beast's Image, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Idolatry,</hi> that they should be killed. Which is plainly the sixth Agreement of our first Parallelism.</p>
                        <p>Ver. VII. <hi>I will tell thee the mystery of the Woman, and of the Beast that carrieth her.</hi> Which Mystery of the <hi>Woman</hi> he unlocks by unfolding first the order and succession of the Beast that carrieth her: for that is a demonstration that it is not meant of <hi>Rome Pagan,</hi> as I have clearly proved in the eleventh Chapter of this Book; and consequently that the meaning of this Mystery of the Whore's Title, which displays her nature, is such as
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:42932:159"/>
I have declared upon the Fifth verse in the fore-going Chapter.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Here we shall onely note, that her <hi>riding of the Beast</hi> implies her to be such a Polity as had the Governance of the whole Empire, was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to one part thereof. As he that rides an Horse is not conceived to ride one part of him, and leave the other unridden, but to ride the whole. So the <hi>Whore</hi> rides the whole Beast, that is, the whole Empire, as well <hi>Oriental</hi> as <hi>Occidental.</hi> Which agrees with the description of the <hi>Two-horned Beast,</hi> whom I conceive to be so depainted in the Vision, because of the two Imperial Patriarchates, the one at <hi>Rome,</hi> the other at <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> dividing in a manner the Empire thus betwixt them, as the Eastern and Western <hi>Caesars</hi> did. But all the whole Clergie of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, I mean the Idolatrizing Clergie, are the Body of this Whore or Beast, of which these two Imperial Patriarchates are the Horns.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Nor have I found any thing yet in the Interpreters that can according to the Prophetick style be interpreted <hi>Horns,</hi> unless some such Concrete Power as this may have place also in the Type. But by a secondary <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopoeia</hi> (it being once admitted that these two Patriarchates are two real Concrete Powers and Dignities, for I understand the two Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs themselves thus empower'd) it may be the <hi>two Horns</hi> of the Episcopal <hi>Mitre</hi> may be also glanced at, as the <hi>seven Heads</hi> signifie as well <hi>seven Hills</hi> as <hi>seven Kings.</hi> And <hi>Josephus Acosta</hi> in his Treatise of the Last times, speaking of this <hi>Two-horned Beast, Duo cornua,</hi> saith he, <hi>Episcopalis</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">De Temp. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viss. <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 17.</note> 
                           <hi>dignitatis, putà Mitrae sive Infulae, (haec enim est Bicornis) insigne sunt. Videtur ergò quòd hic Pseudopropheta erit Episcopus quispiam Apostata &amp; simulator Religionis.</hi> Which Interpretation of the <hi>two Horns</hi> of the Beast <hi>Cornelius à Lapide</hi> seems also inclinable to, and does rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that the Interpretation is no more a reproach to Episcopacy, then that they are <hi>Agni cornua</hi> is a reproach to Christ; but rather an argument of the Excellency of that Degree and Function, this great Apostate en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to recommend himself to the world under that Habit and Dignity.</p>
                        <p>Nor need we exclude Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s Interpretation, who understands by these <hi>two Horns</hi> the <hi>power of Binding and Loosing,</hi> which this <hi>Pseudo-prophetick Beast</hi> pretends to be derived upon him from the Lamb Christ <hi>Jesus.</hi> For these two significations, and more, if there were more as fit and convenient, may by an <hi>Henopoeia</hi> be couched under this one Type; provided first, as I have already said: that the Type have one signification plainly allowable according to the Prophetick style, which every-where in <hi>Daniel</hi> and the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> understands by <hi>Horns</hi> some Persons or other in high place and dignity, not abstract Powers or Virtues; as if one should make an Emperor to have <hi>two Horns,</hi> because he had the power of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death.</hi> This is not warrantable in the Prophetick style, nor would that sense alone support so substantial an Emblem as this.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Wherefore these <hi>two Horns</hi> implying the Pseudo-prophetick Beast <note place="margin">Paral. 1. Agr. 7.</note> to be spread as well over the <hi>Oriental</hi> as <hi>Occidental</hi> part of the Empire, and the Whore's riding the Beast with seven Heads denoting also what a hank she had upon the whole Empire; it appears that the seventh Agreement of our first Parallelism is not without grounds in these Visions. To which
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:42932:160"/>
you may superadde a farther and fuller Confirmation from what we have said upon the first verse in the preceding Chapter; in the second and third Sections.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. <hi>Which has the seven Heads and ten Horns.</hi> The same description of <note place="margin">Paral. 2. Agr. 1.</note> the Beast as to this point is in the Thirteenth Chapter, verse 2. And we have already noted that it makes good the first Agreement of the second Parallelism.</p>
                        <p>Ver. VIII. <hi>The Beast that thou sawest, was, and is not, and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into perdition;</hi>

                           </gap>, <hi>the Son of perdition,</hi> who is so called because he is utterly to be blasted and consumed by the brightness of Christ's appearing. And therefore this <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> is the very same that is spoken of in <hi>Daniel, I beheld till the Beast was slain,</hi> (and he speaks there of the Ten-horned Beast) <hi>and his body de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed and given to the burning flame,</hi> which was to be utterly consumed. But the understanding of this eighth Verse being of so great importance, I shall something more largely paraphrase thereon, that we may the more fully understand the scope thereof; which I conceive is to this sense.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The Beast which thou sawest, and which thou didst see in the two former Visions, is the same Beast, as may appear from the chief Character thereof, <hi>seven Heads</hi> and <hi>ten Horns,</hi> and is one and the same Idolatrous Kingdom or Empire, as is evident in the Serpentine body thereof in the first Vision, from the <hi>names of Blasphemy</hi> on each Head in the second, and from the <hi>body full of names of Blasphemy</hi> in this third and last. But the chief drift of this last Vision (though it have a reflexion upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of the Succession of this Idolatrous Empire, as it is of a-fresh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented in that part of the whole Succession which is next after that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervall wherein for a time it ceased to be,) I say, the chief drift of this Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is, to represent determinately this Idolatrous Empire, and adequately under that succession of time which commenced upon the expiration of that season wherein the Empire was purely Christian, and as yet untainted with Idolatrous Superstitions, even unto that very time wherein Idolatry, having taken its course once more, is quite to be exterminated out of the Empire, never to return thither again.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Wherefore the Angel counting as it were upon his fingers the order of things, and then more particularly pointing at this succession of time; <hi>The Beast which thou sawest;</hi> (saith he to <hi>John)</hi> his name is (for the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statical style of Prophecy may easily admit of such an <hi>Ellipsis) Was, and is not, and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into perdition.</hi> Which is a name of fewer syllables then <hi>Mystery, Babylon the Great, the Mother of fornications and abominations of the Earth.</hi> But such long names are not unusual in Scripture, as appears in <hi>Maher-shalal-hash-baz,</hi> which in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish <note place="margin">Esa. 8. 1.</note> is, <hi>In making speed to the spoil he hasteneth the prey.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. But now the meaning of the Beast's Title or Name is this; That this

Idolatrous Empire is represented onely under that succession of time (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the main scope of this present Vision) under which it being considered, it will be sometime opportune to say, That it is <hi>the Beast that was, and is not, but will ascend again out of the bottomless pit; and then goe into perdition,</hi> that is to say, be finally destroyed, never to revive again. Of that time or state of the Empire under which considered it is sometime seasonable to pronounce thus, is this present Vision of the Beast to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, and of no other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore was thereby especially recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to the Church of Christ for that season when the Empire ceased to be Idolatrous.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. The Angel therefore placing his thoughts on those times of the Church, does here preadvertise them of a strange alteration of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Empire, even while they find it thus purely Christian, and as yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted with Idolatry; namely, that this pure and happy state will pass away, and that the Beast will revive and come again into Being; that is, that the Empire will again become Idolatrous. Which premonition being so useful to as many as receive it, to fortifie them against those Idolatrous Innovations that would be brought into the Church, it is no wonder that the mind of the Angel was fixt on those times when he unriddled the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Vision to <hi>John,</hi> as if he were present then amongst them fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warning them of the danger to come.</p>
                        <p>This is one way of determining the sense of this Vision to the intended time and state of the Idolatrous Empire, that is here aimed at, namely, by placing our minds on those times wherein this <hi>Note</hi> or <hi>Name of the Beast</hi> is rightly applicable to him as future, and not again returned into Being; which was when the Empire was purely Christian.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. But that you may still lay farther hold upon the meaning of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and certainly understand under what succession of time this Idolatrous Empire is represented, I will a little alter his <hi>Note</hi> or <hi>Name,</hi> saith the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, and style him <hi>The Beast that was, and is not, and yet is.</hi> Which Title imports him considered as present, though acknowledged yet to come; for it is a Prophecie, and not an History. But I say in this Title he is considered as present; as those words also most naturally imply, <hi>When they</hi> behold <hi>the Beast that was, and is not, and yet is.</hi> For we <hi>behold</hi> and <hi>eye</hi> things present; and therefore <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap> seems the more reasonable reading as well as the more authentick and approved, (and not <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> would have it out of <hi>Arethas)</hi> and denotes the Empire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Idolatrous again as it was once, and therefore to be the Beast that <hi>was,</hi> and yet to be true that the Beast <hi>is</hi> also. But it is not that Idolatry that consists in worshipping the ancient Pagan Deities, <hi>Mars, Venus, Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi> &amp;c. Wherefore in this respect it is <hi>the Beast that was, but is not.</hi> But considering again, as I said, that onely the Objects are changed, and that the Saints are worshipped with such like Idolatry as the Heathen Deities were, it is in that respect rank Paganism, though exercised upon new Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; and therefore though the Beast be, in some sense, said <hi>not to be,</hi> yet it is true in a very considerable sense that <hi>he is.</hi> Whence it is evident that by <hi>the Beast that was, and is not, and yet is,</hi> is meant this <hi>Roman</hi> Empire degenerated into a Paganizing or Idolatrizing Christianity; which
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:42932:161"/>
though it profess Christianity, bears the Image of the ancient Pagan Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Empire.</p>
                        <p>So that the <hi>Image of the Beast</hi> and <hi>the Beast that was, and is not, and yes</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Paral. 2. Agr. 5.</note> 
                           <hi>is,</hi> do answer exactly one to another. For the Image is, and is not that of which it is the Image, as is easily acknowledged and conceived by any one. Whence the truth of the fifth Agreement of our second Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelism plainly appears.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. This Interpretation which I have given of this verse is so natural and coherent, that I think it were impossible for any one to doubt of it, were it not for that obscurity which arises from that Elliptical manner of speech in the beginning of the verse, <hi>The Beast which thou sawest, was, and is not, and shall ascend,</hi> &amp;c. For it seems to import that this Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was not in S. <hi>John</hi>'s time; which is contrary to truth. But I answer, that there is an <hi>Ellipsis</hi> to be supplied, and then this mistake will vanish. Which supplement may be made either thus, as I have already hinted, <hi>The Beast which thou sawest, his name is, Was, and is not,</hi> &amp;c. or thus, <hi>The Beast which thou sawest, was, and is not, and shall ascend,</hi> &amp;c. this is his <hi>Name,</hi> this his <hi>Character</hi> whereby you shall understand under what succession of time he is to be expected.</p>
                        <p>For it is to be conceived that the Angel had before his sight the entire Succession of the Beast dissected into two parts by that temporary Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption of him in the introduction of pure Christianity into the place of Paganism, that it might become the Religion of the Empire. Now he revolving these <hi>series</hi> of Ages in his mind, in reference to the Beast, on the first he could not inscribe any other Title then, <hi>Is.</hi> For till that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercessation of the Idolatry of the Empire by the victory of pure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted Christianity, it was not proper to say of the Beast, that he <hi>was,</hi> he continuing still in being; much less that he <hi>is not,</hi> he being still in existence. Nor was it seasonable to take notice of his ascent again out of the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less pit, he being as yet not descended thither; nor of his utter and final perdition, he being to revive again after his first Interemption.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. Wherefore this Title being incompetible to the Idolatrous Empire in the first <hi>series</hi> of time it was considered in, it is plain that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel casting his sight forward on these successions of Ages, and finding a season wherein the Beast ceases to be, but withall foreseeing that he would get up again, and then after a certain continuance finally perish, he describes the Beast <hi>under that</hi> Period, styling him, (in an abrupt and rapturous way, without prefacing that it is his style) <hi>The Beast that was, and is not, but would again emerge into Being, and then finally perish.</hi> Which Name the Angel gives him while his eye is fixt on that <hi>Interreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> of his, his temporary cessation from Being. Which occasion of his name though it was transient, as that of the child who was called <hi>Maher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shalal-hash-baz,</hi> yet it may be a permanent Appellation of the Beast, to shew his order in succession. For his <hi>Condition</hi> and <hi>order of succession</hi> into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence is rather hereby noted, then any thing declared of his existing or not existing in S. <hi>John</hi>'s time. Which duly considered and rightly understood will easily take away this seeming difficulty of the Text's implying that the Beast was not in the time of S. <hi>John.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="9">

9. For this Expression concerns not it self at all in any such Assertion, but onely considers the succession and <hi>series</hi> of time under which this Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Empire is comprehended, and has given a name to the Beast under the last succession, not in reference to S. <hi>John</hi>'s time, but in reference to the first <hi>series</hi> of time under which the Idolatrous Empire <hi>was to be,</hi> and then of the time it was <hi>not to be,</hi> and lastly of that <hi>series</hi> of succession it <hi>was to be again,</hi> and then <hi>finally to perish.</hi> Which Character from these <hi>series</hi> of times compared one with another, might have been made as well in <hi>Daniel</hi>'s time as S. <hi>John</hi>'s, they having no coherence or ligation with the time of the Prophet, but onely with one another. For so far forth as is expressed in this verse, the signification is onely of succeeding Order, in Existence and Non-existence and Re-existence, which changes upon that consideration are indeed tied to one another, but free as yet from being fixed to the Prophet's time, or any ones time else.</p>
                        <p>Which thing though I have been so carefull to make good, yet is an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension so easy to admit, that <hi>Alcazar</hi> in his Exposition supposes it without asking leave or giving any account. For he understanding the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived or re-existent Beast of the persecuting Empire under <hi>Julian</hi> the Apostate, whom he makes the eighth King, and acknowledging the Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons exhibited to <hi>John</hi> in <hi>Domitian</hi>'s time when the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was actually persecutive, does evidently implie that <hi>[The Beast which thou sawest, was, and is not]</hi> is not to be understood of Existence or Non-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence joyned with the time of the Vision, (for it had been false to say the Beast <hi>is not,</hi> in <hi>Domitian</hi>'s time) but onely of permutations and successions of the Condition of the Empire. <hi>Cùm igitur</hi> (saith he) <hi>persecutiones in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrumpendae forent, hâc ipsâ interruptione significatur quod Angelus ter repetit capite decimo septimo, dum ait de Bestia,</hi> Fuit &amp; non est, Erat &amp; non est; <hi>Quod idem est ac si diceret,</hi> Modò est &amp; modò non est. Which phrase signifies no set time of Existence or Non-existence, but onely the vicissitude of them.</p>
                        <p>This upon the Thirteenth Chapter; and to the same purpose he speaks upon the Seventeenth, where he asserts that by the <hi>Beast that was, and is not,</hi> the Angel onely intimates that there would be an Intermission of Persecution. I might adde also that our Protestant Expositours go gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally upon the same supposition, as <hi>Paraeus</hi> has noted. But this point, I hope, is abundantly cleared.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. And what has been said of this first Description of the Beast, <hi>Was, is not, and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into perdition,</hi> is to be understood of the second, <hi>Was, is not, and yet is;</hi> namely, that it is the <hi>Name, Nature,</hi> or <hi>Character</hi> of the Beast, not any Assertion concerning his present Existing or Not-existing. For of that Idolatrous Empire which is here indigitated, it could not be properly said, when S. <hi>John</hi> wrote, that it <hi>was,</hi> but <hi>is not;</hi> for it did then continue still in an unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted being. Nor could it be said of it, <hi>Is not, and yet is;</hi> for it was not the Image of the Pagan Idolatrous Empire<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                           </gap>, but that very Empire it self. And it is remarkable that this Beast is described as to come hereafter out of the bottomless pit, and that the world shall wonder at him, when he ascends again upon the Stage, beholding the <hi>Beast that was,</hi>
                           <pb n="292" facs="tcp:42932:162"/>
                           <hi>and is not, and yet is.</hi> Where therefore neither <hi>Was</hi> nor <hi>Is not</hi> have any connexion or ligation with that present Age of S. <hi>John,</hi> seeing it is so evident that <hi>Is</hi> has not, the prediction being not of a present Beast, but of one to come. And indeed to me it seems very improbable that the Title or Name of the Beast would have been so presently in the same verse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated again with this little variation, had it not been done on purpose to be a Key to the meaning of the former Title, and to cast the considerate Reader upon such a sense as I have pitched upon. But to reade <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p n="11">11. Nor can <hi>[Is not, and yet is]</hi> be understood of any Object but with a close touch on the known laws of a right Contradiction. Which is the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious dress which is here affected to excite amusement, and without which it will not sound like either sense or an Elegancy. The same thing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in some sense or other must be affirmed and denied of the same Subject. Wherefore as by that part of the Title <hi>[Was, and is not]</hi> it is naturally understood he is not what he was; and as <hi>[Is not]</hi> is to be understood in the same extent that <hi>Was,</hi> (as if <hi>[Was]</hi> intimate his whole Existence, <hi>[Is not]</hi> must take away his whole Existence; and if <hi>[Was]</hi> intimate onely the Condition or Qualification of Existence, <hi>[Is not]</hi> must take away just so much and no more:) So <hi>[Is not, and yet is]</hi> must be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood in the same extent, and the Object of their Affirmation and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation must be equal; that is to say, either the whole Existence of the thing must be affirmed and denied, or the same Condition or Qualification.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. The former in this case cannot be pretended to, it being so real a Contradiction that it is a down-right Falsity. And in the latter if there were a perfect Sameness, it would be as rank and as unreconcilable a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction. As suppose a man were a King, and should be deposed for a time, but then afterwards be restored to his Kingdom in as full power as ever; it were a real contradiction and gross falshood to say, <hi>He is not King,</hi> as well as, <hi>He is King.</hi> Whence the fondness of <hi>Hugo Grotius</hi> his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation is detected, who makes <hi>Domitian</hi> the Beast that <hi>is not, and yet is.</hi> For it could never be said of him while he was Emperour, that he was not Emperour, or while he was not Emperour, that he was Emperour; because to be Emperour was utterly the same Condition at both times he was so, if he was so twice. For which he has no evasion but by reading <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>But when this sameness is in some respect defective, and verges rather towards similitude then exact Identity, then indeed this Riddle is proper; and though the <hi>Aenigma</hi> seems to amuse a man with a contradiction, yet it declares a truth. As is apparent in our Interpretation of the Beast that <note place="margin">Paral. 2 Agr. 5.</note> 
                           <hi>is not, and yet is;</hi> which is this, That the ancient Idolatrous Empire <hi>is not,</hi> and <hi>yet is:</hi> where both parts are true. For as to the manner of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry it is the same Beast, but in respect of the persons whom they would worship it is not the same; and therefore, as I have already noted, is also called <hi>the Image of the Beast.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="13">13. Wherefore this second Title of the Beast <hi>[Was, and is not, and yet</hi>
                           <pb n="293" facs="tcp:42932:162"/>
                           <hi>is]</hi> being thus plainly discovered not to signify existence, but condition and order of succession, it is a farther assurance that our Interpretation of the former Title of the Beast is true also: and that the omitting of the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion or subjunction of <hi>This is his Name</hi> or <hi>Property,</hi> or the like, is a mere Prophetick Ellipsis, and Artifice of concealment, warrantable upon a double ground; either as spoken rapturously and ecstatically, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thus Elliptically; or else because there are Examples of such an Ellipsis in other places of Scripture and in the very same case, as <hi>Apoc.</hi> 1. and <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.</p>
                        <p>But to object that there they breed no such obscurity or sense as in this place, is to acknowledge what I contend for, that the Ellipsis is here used on set pupose for concealment; but the concealment again more recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, and not at all invincible, because this Ellipsis is not without Examples in Scripture, and made, it may be, not without some allusion to those very Texts, where the Name of God is <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="295" facs="tcp:42932:164"/>

Which Resemblance by way of elegancy gives the title of Identity, as if that which is very like were exactly the same. So he that came in the Spirit of <hi>Elias</hi> was called <hi>Elias;</hi> and one egregiously <hi>Epicurean</hi> or <hi>Platonical,</hi> might be called <hi>Epicurus redivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus,</hi> or <hi>Plato redivivus,</hi> as if the one were really <hi>Epicurus,</hi> the other <hi>Plato.</hi> And it is a vulgar expression, <hi>That such an one will never die, while such a Son of his,</hi> namely, one that is exactly like him, <hi>is alive;</hi> conceding herein that the Father may be dead and alive at once, dead in his own person, but alive in that lively image of himself, his surviving Son. <hi>Quanquam nullum monumentum clarius</hi> Servius Sulpitius <hi>relinquere potuit quàm effigiem morum suorum, constantiae, pietatis, ingenii, filium.</hi> Of such a son as this is that saying of <hi>Siracides, Though his father die,</hi>

And these <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Sorts</hi> are not seven Individuals of different sorts, but the whole
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:42932:166"/>
Succession of each sort, by an usual <hi>Henopoeia.</hi> And that seven different Sorts of Governours may be called <hi>Seven Heads</hi> as well as seven Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Persons, I think is demonstrable by Reason, because there is a greater difference betwixt Kind and kind, then betwixt Individuals of the same kind. Whence I wonder that <hi>Grotius</hi> should call seven forms of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, taken concretely, (as every one does take them) <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>. Whenas if there be such a sevenfold difference in the supreme Powers in the succession of an Empire, the Empire once considered as a Beast, it will be <hi>ipso facto</hi> Seven-headed whether we will or no. So farre is it from being a <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, that it is a natural and inevitable truth.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Now the Division of the succession of the Supreme Powers of the Empire is made naturally thus. This Power was either in <hi>many</hi> or in <hi>one:</hi> In <hi>many,</hi> as in the <hi>Consuls,</hi> the <hi>Tribuni Militum,</hi> the <hi>Decemviri;</hi> In <hi>one,</hi> as in the <hi>Kings, Dictatours,</hi> and <hi>Emperours.</hi> Which <hi>Emperours</hi> I will again divide into <hi>Pagan, Christian,</hi> and <hi>Pagano-Christian.</hi> So that the whole line of succession of these Supreme Powers is divided, first into two equal parts, and then each of those two subdivided into three, and then one part of the second subdivision into three again. So that the whole line does naturally fall into eight parts, agreeably to the History of things and declaration of the Prophecy.</p>
                        <p>For there are plainly numbered <hi>Eight Kings,</hi> though but <hi>Seven Heads</hi> of the Beast. For under the Christian Emperours the Empire was no Beast, and therefore there could be no Head thereof.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Nor know I any tolerable solution of this Riddle of <hi>Eight Kings</hi> and yet but <hi>Seven Heads,</hi> but this. For the shortness of the stay of the Christian Succession cannot put them out of the number of the Heads, since the stay of the <hi>Decemviri</hi> was above fourty times shorter. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not this, but because the Empire during their succession was not a Beast, nor they either fit or actual Heads of one; but were onely Heads or Kings of the undegenerated and not-yet-again-Paganizing Empire. Which therefore was the time of the Death of the Beast, when he was not, and therefore was to have no Head, nor could have any.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Nor is there the least ground of any Cavil against our last Subdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision, which is of <hi>Emperours</hi> into <hi>Pagan, purely Christian,</hi> and <hi>Pagano-Christian,</hi> as if there were not a cause fundamental enough of this last Distribution: Whenas on the contrary there is such a strong Opposition betwixt the two first members thereof, that one outs the other, the seventh King being the wounder and killer of the sixth Head. And for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as when a Religion is made the Religion of a Kingdom or Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, it is in a sort the Law of that Empire; it may be rationally concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that there is even a Political difference betwixt a <hi>Christian</hi> and a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi> Emperour. And, lastly, be that how it will, it is plain to all men that there is a very eminent and notorious difference betwixt a <hi>Christian</hi> and a <hi>Pagan</hi> Emperour, and of more concernment to the Church of God then any Political Distinction of Government. And that which most concerns his Church, we may be assured God takes most notice of; and therefore would be as likely to distinguish the succession of Supreme Governours by this difference as by any.</p>

5. Nay I think I may safely adde, that it is likely, that when once the Angel had come to the division of the Heads or rather Kings into <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> and <hi>Pagano-Christian,</hi> he did wholly neglect the confidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Political differences of forms of Government in the Empire, that notion being now impertinent to his design, and contented himself with the distinction of them from the account of Religion onely. But till this he numbered according to the distinction of Political form, they all of them till now agreeing in pure Paganism. So that the sense of <hi>[The Beast that was, and is not, his Head is the eighth King]</hi> seems to be this, That supreme Power, be the Political frame or Title of it what it will, which is over the Beast revived, that is, over the Empire Idolatrizing again, all that Succession, pitch upon it where you will, be it Pope, be it Emperour, is look'd upon as the Eighth King or last Head of the Beast. For this is that which this Vision onely concerns it self in, and not useless discriminations and niceties. Which supposition is agreeable to our third Rule of interpreting Prophecy.</p>
                        <p>And what was said in the behalf of the Distinction of the two first Members of my last Subdivision, is so easily applicable to the last compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the second, that is to say, <hi>Pagano-Christian</hi> with <hi>Christian,</hi> that I need onely advertise so much, and pass to other things.</p>
                        <p>The Proof of the truth of my first Subdivision into <hi>Consules, Tribuni militum, Decemviri,</hi> and <hi>Kings, Dictators</hi> and <hi>Emperours,</hi> or <hi>Caesars,</hi> I will deferre till after I have finished my Joint-Exposition.</p>

For what communion or affinity had the pure Christian <hi>Caesars</hi> with the purely Pagan?</p>
                        <p>But now when he comes to this last Head, which I cannot avoid for significancy to term <hi>Pagano-Christian,</hi> (the whole Empire from head to foot being supposed such) this King he thinks good to call the <hi>Eighth,</hi> because he being derived from a double Line, takes in all Predecessors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, as well Christian as Pagan; and therefore reckoning here <gap reason="foreign">

                           <hi>to the Beast.</hi> And therefore in the Thirteenth Chapter he is also adorned with this gift, where he is described <hi>The Beast with seven Heads and ten Horns, and upon his Horns ten Crowns;</hi> which shews that even when they were actually Kings, they were voluntarily the strength of this Beast. For what strength in the Empire could have constrained them, they being the very strength thereof? Whence appears the thirteenth Agreement of our second Parallelism.</p>
                        <p>But the sense of this verse is briefly this: These ten Kings <hi>shall be of one mind,</hi> that is, of one mind in matters of Religion, shall be of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the Empire, that is to say, of the Pagano-Christian Religion, whereby the Empire had again become a Beast; <hi>and shall give their power and strength unto this Beast,</hi> that is to say, shall be ready even by force of Arms, if need be, or by what other power or authority they have, to maintain this Beast in its beastly, that is, in its Idolatrous condition and Pagan-like Superstitions: or else, understanding all along a <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> shall give the Pagano-Christian Emperour (which is the Head of this Beast) the aid or afford him the assistence of their Armies or forces, if need should so require, against all Opposers of this Pagano-christianism. For the Emperour is look'd upon as the chief Champion and <hi>Generalissimo</hi> of all the Pagano-Christian Forces. And though those Kings be distinct and absolute in their own Dominions, yet looking upon them as held together in one upon the account of the Religion of the Empire, of which the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour is by place the chief Champion, these ten Kings may be considered as coming into a kind of subordination unto him, and be conceived to be the Horns of this Head, I mean, of this <hi>Generalissimo</hi> or Emperour of that Army which <hi>makes War with the Lamb.</hi> But that Power which influences all is the <hi>Whore</hi> that rides the Beast.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. And truly when the Head of this <hi>Whore</hi> is once found to be so big as to out-top the <hi>Secular Head</hi> of the Empire, the <hi>Emperours</hi> themselves, and both pretends to and makes use of that boasted <hi>Jus utriusque gladii;</hi> that is to say, So soon as the <hi>Pope</hi> is found to act the <hi>Caesar</hi> as well as the
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:42932:169"/>
Universal Patriarch, there is no incongruity to allow him represented in two places as well as he sustains two parts, and conceive him to be typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd as well in the last Head of the Beast as in the costly adorned Head of the <hi>Whore.</hi> But my way is more distinct and more compliable with <hi>Grotius</hi> his opinion, who stands so stoutly for the permanency of the Imperial Majesty to this day. And it seems also reasonable to me to interpret Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie according to the sense and phrase of History; <hi>Prophecie</hi> being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but an <hi>Anticipative History.</hi> And therefore the <hi>Series</hi> of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Emperours and Title of the Empire and the Body of the Empire continuing still, (though much contracted) and being so look'd upon in History, I should think it is the most natural way to interpret according to the common acknowledged phrase and sense of Historians.</p>
                        <p>But, as I said, if the Pope be conceived to supply the room of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, as soon or as oft as he appears to out-top them even in Secular power, and to prove the real Head of the Empire, acting the <hi>Caesar</hi> as well as the <hi>Patriarch;</hi> that Interpretation also is very approvable and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionable. For the Supreme Power of the Beast <hi>that was, and is not,</hi> is by the Angel look'd upon as one and the same Head, provided it be but all along the Head of that Beast that is <hi>Pagano-Christian.</hi> For the spirit of Prophecie takes no notice of any useless distinctions and discriminations. Wherefore that Supreme Power that shall be found Pagano-Christian is still one Head in the style of this Prophecie, as I have above noted. And that which is under it, though it were invested with the Title of <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,</hi> will fall under the number of the <hi>Ten Horns</hi> after the division of the Empire into many Kingdoms, <hi>Ten</hi> suppose at least, or thereabout. For I look upon the number to signifie Symbolically rather then purely Arithmetically.</p>
                        <p>Ver. XIV. <hi>These shall make war with the Lamb.</hi> What is said of these <note place="margin">Par. 2. Agr. 14.</note> 
                           <hi>Ten Kings,</hi> is said of the <hi>Beast</hi> in the Thirteenth Chapter, That <hi>he should make war with the Saints;</hi> which is the same as <hi>to war with the Lamb. Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?</hi> And these <hi>Ten Kings</hi> being the Horns of the Beast, what is done by them is done by the Beast. So that the Beasts in both Chapters make war with the Saints, according to the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Agreement of our second Parallelism.</p>
                        <p>As for the 16 and 17 verses of the Thirteenth Chapter, the sense of them is this; That no man, of what degree soever, that was not of the Pagano-Christian <hi>Profession,</hi> (for that is meant by <hi>receiving a mark in the hand or in the fore-head)</hi> should have any traffick or commerce in the Empire or Territories of any of these Ten Kings, which is a kind of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieging them with famine, and therefore not unfitly reckoned under the Hostilities of War. Which interdiction of all commerce and traffick is an effect of <hi>Excommunication</hi> by the Two-horned Beast. Examples of which Warfare are obvious every-where in History. Concerning the <hi>Name of the Beast</hi> and the <hi>Number of his name,</hi> mentioned in those 16 and 17 verses, I shall speak upon the last verse of this present Chapter.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>And the Lamb shall overcome them.</hi> According to that in the Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth <note place="margin">Par. 2.

                        <p>But that the <hi>Two Horns</hi> of the Second Beast import the same thing, <note place="margin">Par. 1. Agr. 7.</note> I have already named; and whether this <hi>exercising all the power of the first Beast before him</hi> may not as well respect extent of place as the kinds of power, I leave to further disquisition. Enough already has been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced for the making good of the seventh Agreement of our first Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallelism.</p>
                        <p>Ver. XVI. <hi>And the Ten Horns which thou sawest upon the Beast, these shall hate the Whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.

What execution also the <hi>making of her desolate and naked and eating of her flesh</hi> does imply, I shall defer to declare till the last part of our Discourse.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time having so plainly discovered that this <hi>Whore</hi> is not a City built with Wood and Stone, but an Hierarchical Polity degenerated into a kind of Idolatrous Paganism, the very same with the <hi>Two-horned Beast</hi> or Pseudo-prophetick Body, I must confess I see no necessity of any such War as should aim at the burning of the ancient City of <hi>Rome,</hi> but that this Prophecy may be fulfilled without any such martial noise, or ruines, or garments rowled in bloud. Which is a thing seriously to be considered for the peace and welfare of Christendom. For the hatred of these <hi>Ten Horns</hi> against the <hi>Whore,</hi> and their persecution of her, implies no such raising of Forces, or marching in Battalia against Bulwarks and Walls and Houses, and taking so long an Expedition as to <hi>Rome.</hi> For this City is larger then to be comprised within the whole confines of <hi>Italy.</hi> For it is a Pseudo-prophetick Polity that has spred through the whole Territories of the Empire, a Water-Nymph whose skirts are so large, that she has sat floting upon the whole Imperial Ocean for these many Ages; and therefore is such as neither the Punishment of <hi>burning</hi> nor <hi>drowning</hi> is competible to, in that crass and literal sense as vulgarly is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood.

                           <hi>and given up to them</hi> (as it were) <hi>by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God.</hi> Wherefore it should seem that such invincible cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances and inviting opportunities which God by his permissive or more positive Providence brings into the world, to try or rather discover what is in the hearts of the wicked, and which he is well assured will naturally take effect in those that are lapsed into this lower Fate, are look'd upon as Suggestions or Transmissions and Motions upon the hearts of men from God himself; and that by such a providential frame of affairs of his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing at least, if not contriving, the minds of men are determinated to act thus or thus. And no other way then this need we understand touching <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s heart being hardened by God: the grand cause whereof was his permitting the <hi>Magicians</hi> to emulate, if not equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize, the Miracles of <hi>Moses</hi> for the most part; for so the Text runs, <hi>And the Magicians did so with their Inchantments, and Pharaoh's heart was hardened.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And it is as easie to conceive that it might be permitted to the Pseudo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prophetick Beast (by the officious Assistence of the Powers of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness) to doe such Miracles and use such ways of imposing upon the Ten Kings as would certainly enough determine them to the Idolatrous Religion of the Empire. But that they were thus certain to be deceived, is the fault of their own lapse and of the after-Consequences of it, not any Injustice in God.</p>

                        <p>This 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verse therefore gives a reason of the unexpected hatred and hostility of the <hi>Ten Horns</hi> against the <hi>Whore</hi> in the foregoing verse, namely, That their giving their Kingdoms to the Beast (which is their professing of that Idolatrous Religion they were intoxicated with by the <hi>Whore</hi> that rides the Beast) was to be but for a determinate time fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by the Oracles of God; but that Period expiring, the Scene of things would fatally change, and the doom of the <hi>little Horn</hi> or of the <hi>great Whore</hi> would be executed upon them.

the Beast, (as the four Successours of <hi>Alexander</hi> are called the four <hi>Horns</hi> of the <hi>Greek</hi> Empire divided into four shares;) yet these Kingdoms them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves may be look'd upon as the greatest share of the Body of the Beast, while they are at the devotion of the <hi>Whore,</hi> and profess her Idolatrous Religion. Whence their flying upon the Harlot to consume her is <hi>ipso facto</hi> the dissolving or destroying the Beast, that is, the making the Empire to cease to be Idolatrous.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore it is plain that the continuance of this <hi>Ten-horned Beast</hi> is <note place="margin">Par. 2. Agr. 17.</note> said to be determined by God in this Chapter as well as in the Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth, where it is said that <hi>it is given unto him to continue fourty two months,</hi> which is plainly <hi>three years and an half,</hi> the same that <hi>a Time and Times and half a Time.</hi> Whence the truth of the seventeenth Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our second Parallelism is cleared.</p>
                        <p>Ver. XVIII. <hi>And the Woman which thou sawest is that great City which reigneth over the Kings of the Earth.</hi> The adjection of this last part of the Interpretation is of special consequence, and very answerable to the event of things. For this Idolatrous Hierarchy having at first as magnificent a Seat in the Oriental part of the Empire as the Occidental, and both these Imperial Patriarchates being in a manner alike engaged and alike active, or at least alike authoritative, in the debauching of the Empire with Idolatrous doctrines and practices; the Seat of the Great <hi>Whore</hi> is not restrain'd necessarily to one place more then another at first. But because afterwards this Occidental Patriarchate did so much emerge above the other, and exceed the other, not onely in his peremptoriness and activity in keeping up and propagating Idolatry, and is so foully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smeared, or rather has been so swinishly drunk, with the bloud of the Witnesses of <hi>Jesus,</hi> but also besides all this did acquire to himself the Right and Title of <hi>Universal Bishop,</hi> and has for a long time laid claim to and exercised this power; (to say nothing of his high insultations over the <hi>Caesarean</hi> Majesty, and his usurping as well his Rights, as wearing the Imperial Ensigns) I say, this Idolatrous Hierarchy growing so big in time in these Western parts of the Empire, and their power shrivelling up or melting away so much in the Eastern, and not continuing in nor advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to that gross measure of <hi>Antichristianism</hi> that is found in the other, the Spirit of God has accordingly more strongly stamped the mark of discovery on the <hi>Western</hi> Hierarchy then on the <hi>Eastern;</hi> and because that See lays claim to an Universal Jurisdiction, has made <hi>Old Rome,</hi> I mean the whole Hierarchy whose Head is seated there, to be this <hi>Great Whore.</hi> For he saith, <hi>The Woman which thou sawest is that great City which [now reigneth] over the Kings of the Earth.</hi> For it is the present Tense, and spoken in S. <hi>John</hi>'s time, when there was no Seven-Hilled City that reigned over the Kings of the Earth but <hi>Old Rome.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of necessity it is she.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. But besides that <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> signifies in the present Tense, and is all one as if one should say, <hi>quae nunc regnat;</hi> it is farther observable, that if it were not determined to this sense it would rather be a Nugati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if a man may speak it with reverence, then an Interpretation, and would be added to no purpose, as being of an uncertain sound, and not able
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:42932:172"/>
to signify any thing but what was said before. For in that she is said to <hi>whore with the Kings of the Earth,</hi> and to <hi>ride the Beast,</hi> and to <hi>sit upon Peoples and Multitudes and Nations and Tongues,</hi> this already amounts to as much as the <hi>reigning over the Kings of the Earth.</hi> Wherefore this Adjection must have this peculiar in it, that in saying <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, it implies that that City was meant that ruled the world in S. <hi>John</hi>'s time, and therefore is the <hi>Seven-Hilled Rome.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But why do I goe about so industriously to prove that which our very Adversaries do not deny, as <hi>Ribera</hi> and <hi>Cornelius à Lapide,</hi> who both acknowledge <hi>Old Rome</hi> here meant, and <hi>Alcazar</hi> also and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> upon particular evincement from this verse? The words of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> are, <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que enim alia Civitas est quae Joannis tempore imperium habuerit super Reges terrae quàm Roma, &amp; notissimum est supra septem montes Romam adificatam esse.</hi> Which two things joyn'd together is a Demonstration that <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> here is meant, and no other City.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The sense therefore of the Verse may be clearly delivered in this short Paraphrase. The <hi>Woman</hi> which thou sawest riding on <hi>the Beast that was, and is not, and yet is,</hi> is that great City which now ruleth over the Kings of the Earth, that is to say, it is <hi>Rome,</hi> whose Inhabitants, though flowing successively, are accounted one and the same City, because included with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the same walls or buildings; as that is accounted one and the same River that flows betwixt the same banks, though the same Water does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue for a day together.</p>
                        <p>This <hi>Woman</hi> then which S. <hi>John</hi> saw riding the Empire under the last<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Head thereof, upon the pretence of being the true Catholick and Apostolick Church, though indeed become an Apostatized Harlot, this Woman, I say, is that very City, that great City, that great <hi>Roman</hi> State or Polity that now <hi>rules over the Kings of the Earth,</hi> saith the Angel to S. <hi>John.</hi> But where or from whence could that be but from <hi>Rome</hi> the Imperial City? Whence it is evident that the Roman Catholick Church (as she calls her self) which rules the world from the Seven Hills, is to be understood, as being look'd upon as one and the same Woman; this new <hi>Roman</hi> Hierarchy succeeding and being seated as much in the same City, that is, as much with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Roman</hi> walls, as that ancient Polity was.</p>
                        <p>Which is as easy to conceive, as if one should prophesy of a certain River that it should run bloud three hundred years hence, and then should adde that this River is that River that now discharges it self with seven mouths into the <hi>Mediterranean.</hi> For it is evident that this must be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of the waters of <hi>Nilus,</hi> and yet not of those that flow now, but those that shall flow three hundred years hence. And as we would say, that this very River <hi>Nilus</hi> that runs now into the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> is the River that will run tinctured with bloud three hundred years hence, though the water is not the same now and then nor of the same Quality: so might it be said in S. <hi>John</hi>'s time that that very City (meaning the Power or Polity there) which then ruled the world would ride <hi>the Beast that was, and is not, and yet is,</hi> so many Ages after, though the Polity be no more the same then the water of <hi>Nilus</hi> now running is the same with the bloudy water which is foretold shall flow within his banks three hundred years hence.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="311" facs="tcp:42932:172"/>
So easy and natural is the Expression of the Angel in this last verse, and so manifest the determination of the Woman's Seat to <hi>Old Rome,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly as it has come to pass.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. And that the Vision of the <hi>Two-horned Beast</hi> may keep perfect pace with this of the <hi>Whore,</hi> for the same reasons which I have already here alledged the Seat of the <hi>Two-horned Beast</hi> is likewise at last re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to <hi>Rome;</hi> as the onely See of the Universal Head of the Pseudo-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick Body.</p>
                        <p>Which restriction is discoverable as well by the Numeral Name of the Beast, as by numbering that Number comprised in his Name. The former Computation is observed by Bishop <hi>Dounham</hi> to be cavilled against by some as <hi>Cabbalistical.</hi> But he proves it plainly enough out of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> that this kind of Computation is <hi>Traditionary</hi> even from S. <hi>John</hi> himself: <note place="margin">De Antichrist. lib. 6. cap. 4.</note> And though a many <hi>Pseudo-Cabbalists</hi> have brought the very name of <hi>Cabbala</hi> into a suspectedness, yet I must confess that I think the fame there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was not raised upon nothing, but that there was such an hidden way of delivering the great <hi>Arcana</hi> of knowledge, and that part thereof was the Symbol of <hi>Numbers,</hi> (which is frequent in this Book of the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> as well as continual in the first Chapter of <hi>Genesis.)</hi> Not to take notice that that very Expression of <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega</hi> seems to be <hi>Cabbalistical,</hi> there being frequent mention with them of <hi>Aleph lucidum</hi> and <hi>Aleph tenebro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum;</hi> concerning which <hi>Robert Flud,</hi> (who pleased himself in diving into these depths so far as his bucket would reach) <hi>Habetis,</hi> saith he, <hi>Aleph</hi>

                        <p>Wherefore whenas not onely the <hi>Latines</hi> but the <hi>Greeks</hi> called them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <hi>Romans,</hi> and their Emperours <hi>Imperatores Romani,</hi> their City also <hi>New Rome,</hi> and the Countrey about it <hi>Romania;</hi> the <hi>Latine</hi> Church, or <gap reason="foreign">

For this distinction of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Church was so notorious and acknowledged, that in general Councils the <hi>Western</hi> Bishops were called the <hi>Latine</hi> Bishops, and the Subscriptions of them both were accordingly distinct under the Titles of <hi>Patrum Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum &amp; Patrum Graecorum.</hi> Thus exquisitely does the <hi>Name of the Beast</hi> determine him to <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Italy.</hi>

I say, not every thing whose Name contains 666, in the letters thereof, can be this Beast; but toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a Name containing this Number, all those things that are said of the <hi>Two-horned Beast</hi> must be also applicable to what-ever any one will pitch upon for Him. For no man that minds what he saith will argue thus, This Person or Polity's Name comprises 666, therefore he is the Beast: but rather thus, This Person or Polity does or has done all those things that the <hi>Two-horned Beast</hi> is said to have done in reference to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and moreover his Name also comprehends 666; wherefore this is most assuredly the Beast. This is sound Reasoning, yea perfect De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration.</p>

                        <p>For he could not say, <gap reason="foreign">

Wherefore as the Square-Root of 36. may rightly be conceived to detect that that famed <hi>Tetractys</hi> had a relation to the <hi>Hexameron</hi> of <hi>Moses,</hi> and signified that every Day's Creation had its <hi>Foeminine</hi> Principle as well as <hi>Masculine,</hi> the <hi>First</hi> it self not excepted, (which is consonant to that Aphorism of the Jews, <hi>Nulla virtus divina descendit sine indumento,</hi> and to <hi>Moses</hi> his assimilating the First Day's Creation to <hi>Light:)</hi> so the Square-Root of this Number of the Beast may also detect to whom this Vision of the <hi>Two-horned Beast</hi> doth belong. And I have already shewed in my <hi>Mystery of Godliness,</hi> that the Root of this Number is 25, and that <note place="margin">Book 5. Ch. 16.

                        <p n="11">11. In the mean time I will not stick to conclude, that it is apparent <note place="margin">Paral. 2. Agr. 9.</note> partly from what I have delivered there, and partly from what is added in this place, That the Seat as well of the <hi>Two-horned Beast</hi> as of the <hi>Whore</hi> is at last in their respective Visions determined to <hi>Old Rome,</hi> as being the most permanent and conspicuous Residence of the Apostatized Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and such as, by being so notorious an Instance of this Wickedness, becomes a Measure and Rule of comparing and judging of the greatness of the Apostasy of other Churches by their nearer accession and agreement to this Queen of Harlots. And therefore by intimating the <hi>Name, Number</hi> and <hi>Seat</hi> of this chief part of the Apostatized Clergy, it gives us the clear knowledge and fast apprehension of the whole corrupted Body and all the parts thereof, where-ever and how long soever they be found within the Boundaries of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire.</p>
                        <p>But when once they are swallowed up and washed off by some extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Power, and fall under the Jurisdiction of some other Empire, I must confess (though we may judge these too by this measure) I do not see how they then can so well be concerned or aimed at in these two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:42932:174"/>
both the <hi>Two-horned Beast</hi> and the <hi>Whore</hi> being look'd upon as Riders and Guiders of the Beast with seven Heads and ten Horns, and therefore supposed within the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. Which is a plain cause why these Prophecies have laid so fast hold on the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> in the conclusion of them, as if she were in a manner solely concerned. For it was fit so to doe by reason of her Permanency in Duration, as well as Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency in wickedness.</p>
                        <p>Which may be one reason also why this body of the adulterate <hi>Clergy</hi> is called <hi>the Beast with two Horns;</hi> because all those Patriarchates annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated to the <hi>Greek</hi> Church were betimes swept away, a new Empire overflowing them, whenas the Patriarchate of <hi>Constantinople</hi> was free from this inundation till about two hundred years ago. So faithful is the Spirit of Prophecy in the Prefiguration of Events; as he may easily see that pleases to consult History. In the mean time, as I said, it is manifest enough that the <hi>Seat</hi> as well of the <hi>Whore</hi> as the <hi>Two-horned Beast</hi> in each Vision is determined to <hi>Old Rome.</hi> Which is the last Agreement of our first Parallelism.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. As the last of our second is, That the Seat of the <hi>Seven-headed</hi>

                           <hi>Beast</hi> is left free in either Vision, and not fixt to any Metropolis. Indeed the <hi>Seven Heads</hi> of the Beast being also interpreted of the <hi>Seven Hills</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> it is apparent that the Beast has some relation to that place, and must have some Title or denomination from that City, else why should the Beast's Heads have any thing to doe to typifie those <hi>Seven Hills?</hi> But the Prophecy, as it were <hi>datâ operâ,</hi> declining the fixing the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Seat of the Seven-headed Beast, bestows that Privilege on the Whore, assigns her the <hi>Seven-Hilled</hi> seat, saying, <hi>The seven Heads are seven Hills where the Whore sitteth.</hi> Which is admirably agreeable to the event. For indeed <hi>Rome</hi> has been the constant See of the <hi>Whore,</hi> but the Seat of the <hi>Seven-headed Beast</hi> has been very changeable, some time at <hi>Rome,</hi> then at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and lastly in <hi>Germany.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="13">13. And thus we have seen the exquisite Congruity and Coincidence of all the parts of the Visions of these <hi>Thirteenth</hi> and <hi>Seventeenth</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters one with another: which though they be so accurately correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, yet I must confess not altogether so adequately, but that the Vision of the <hi>Whore</hi> bears a more press and close respect to the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> all along; and besides the plain designment of her Seat, which is common to both, her <hi>gorgeous attire</hi> and <hi>bloud-thirstiness,</hi> or rather her being so la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishly <hi>bloud-drunk,</hi> as she is described, seems to appropriate the Vision more peculiarly to her then the <hi>Greek</hi> Church. Which <hi>Drunkenness</hi> as well as <hi>Gorgeousness of Apparrel,</hi> though it be not all along the reign of the <hi>Whore,</hi> yet according to the nature of these Prophetick Figures, which exhibit the whole Succession of affairs under one joint show, they were without any discrimination to be represented at once.</p>
                        <p>Which Consideration may take off any the like scruple in these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick Schemes and Representations.

That there had been no more then <hi>Five</hi> sorts of Supreme Governours in S. <hi>John</hi>'s time; and that the <hi>Interreges</hi> were not, nor were at all reckoned by Historians, a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Government distinct from that of <hi>Kings.</hi> 8.

                        <p>That the <hi>Roman Kingdom</hi> or <hi>Empire</hi> is to be reckoned from their first Kings downwards, I think no man will scruple, nor that it is all along the same Beast, as well as <hi>Florus</hi> considers it as <hi>one Man,</hi> and distinguishes his <hi>Ages,</hi> allotting the first 250 years from <hi>Romulus</hi> to the <hi>Infancy</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> People or Empire, and then 200 years more to its <hi>Youth,</hi> and then 250 years more, which reached to <hi>Augustus</hi> his time, to the <hi>Manly Age</hi> of the Empire; but the next 200 years he calls <hi>Senectutem Imperii.</hi> Which shews plainly that he looks upon the whole Succession as one and the same Empire, though under several growths; which yet was longer-lived a great deal then to be accounted old in <hi>Trajan</hi>'s time. Wherefore History it self looking upon the whole Succession of the <hi>Roman</hi> People as one Body Politick, there can be no harshness at all in describing this Body by <hi>such a number of Heads</hi> as reached from the first beginning of this Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession to the last Period of the Empire.</p>

Of <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Consuls</hi> there is no controversy at all.

                        <p n="7">7. Thus are we assured that there were <hi>Five sorts of Supreme Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours</hi> before S. <hi>John</hi>'s time in the <hi>Roman</hi> State or Empire. And that there were no more then <hi>Five,</hi> I think we may be easily persuaded, when they can bring no other into competition but the <hi>Interreges</hi> and <hi>Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viri Reipublicae constituendae,</hi> which <hi>Grotius</hi> urges. For it is evident that the <hi>Interreges</hi> are necessarily reducible to the Regal Power, being but a vicarious Appendage thereto, and not a distinct <hi>Species</hi> of Supreme Power it self, nor so reckoned by Historians.

                        <p n="8">8. And for the <hi>Triumviri Reipublicae constituendae, Tacitus,</hi> who of set purpose in the beginning of his Annals reckons up all the Forms of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Power in the <hi>Roman</hi> State, declines the mentioning of any such <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umvirate: Urbem Romam à principio Reges habuere,</hi> (no mention of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terreges;) Libertatem &amp; Consulatum L.

But now when he falls upon those times wherein this <hi>Triumvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratus Reipublicae constituendae</hi> was to be noted, he runs over it as not to
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:42932:177"/>
be taken notice of, going on onely in this manner, <hi>Non Cinnae, non Sullae long a Dominatio, &amp; Pompeii Crassique potentia citò in Caesarem,</hi> (which <hi>Cinna</hi> was onely Consul, <hi>Sulla</hi> first Consul and then Dictator, and <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi> and <hi>Crassus</hi> Consuls or Proconsuls and no more.) But now where is the very nick of naming this <hi>Triumviratus Reipublicae constituendae,</hi> he onely addes, <hi>Lepidi atque Antonii arma in Augustum cessere, qui cuncta discordiis civilibus fessa nomine Principis sub imperium cepit.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Wherefore according to this description of things, this pretended <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umvirate</hi> is no Supreme Magistracy, but a Political Scuffle or Scamble or transient Shuffle betwixt these three men, <hi>Octavius, Antony</hi> and <hi>Lepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus.</hi> And though they called themselves <hi>Triumviros Reipublicae consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuendae,</hi> it was but for a blind to the people; nor had they any legitimate creation to that Office, unless <hi>Octavius</hi> be supposed to be Emperour, and they to be appointed or admitted by him into a participation of his Imperial Power. And then it is plain that this is onely a part of the <hi>Sixth</hi> Head which was in being in S. <hi>John</hi>'s time. Otherwise it is but a momentany Usurpation and Confusion in the Commonwealth, no legitimate Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracy at all.</p>
                        <p>And therefore <hi>Fenestella,</hi> though he first speaks doubtfully of this <note place="margin">De <hi>Magistr. Rom.</hi> cap. 22.</note> 
                           <hi>Triumvirate, Utrùm Potestatibus annumerandum censuerim haud satis scio;</hi> yet presently he recovers himself, and speaks more definitively, <hi>Quippe quòd eas Potestates quas injussu praetérque Senatûs authoritatem quisque, non dicam sortitus fuerit, sed per libidinem dominandi arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puerit, Tyrannides potiùs quàm Potestates seu Magistratus appellandos duxerim.</hi> And at the end of the same Chapter, he again smartly taxes the pretence of this Power, and makes it no legitimate Magistracy: <hi>Igitur Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannidem praetextu Magistratûs palliare pergentes, sese Triumviros Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicae constituendae appellavere; quorum nutu &amp; auspiciis omnis Respub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica niteretur.

                        <p n="9">9. But if we take this Affair by the other ear, and will look upon <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius Augustus</hi> as he was Heir to <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> in whom was the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Power of the Empire, and also as upon one to whom the Senate had given a Precedency before the Consuls themselves, and a Power un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded by Law, insomuch that he might rationally be deemed the Prince of the Commonwealth; and that onely upon design he invited and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted <hi>Antony</hi> and <hi>Lepidus</hi> to partake of his Principate, for the better suppressing of <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius,</hi> and then of his Partners one by the other: these <hi>Triumviri</hi> will be found really three Emperours, (as there have been two, and three, and four at a time in other occurrences of affairs of the Empire, as is well known to any one that knows any thing in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story) and not any <hi>Species</hi> of Government distinct from the <hi>Sixth</hi> kind, which is that of the <hi>Emperours.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For they being three Generals of the Imperial Forces, <hi>Antony</hi> of the
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:42932:177"/>
Eastern, <hi>Octavius</hi> of the Western, and <hi>Lepidus</hi> of the <hi>African,</hi> and of power unaccountable or unsubordinate to any other Magistracy, what were they indeed but <hi>Three Emperours</hi> at once, in that Notion that the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchs were after called Emperours? And accordingly in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story <hi>Augustus</hi> is reckoned to have reigned as Emperour from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cease of his Father <hi>Julius.</hi> To which sense <hi>Suetonius</hi> speaks, <hi>Atque ab eo tempore exercitibus comparatis, primùm cum Marco Antonio Marcóque Lepido, dein tantùm cum Antonio per duodecim ferè annos, novissime per quatuor &amp; quadraginta solus Rempublicam tenuit.</hi> Upon which <hi>Nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clerus</hi> thus comments, <hi>Regnavit annis quinquaginta sex, duodecim cum Antonio &amp; Lepido, solus verò quadraginta quatuor.</hi> And Chronologers as well of the Pontifician as Protestant Party fix the beginning of his Reign <hi>ab</hi> U. C. <hi>Anno</hi> 710.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. Wherefore these <hi>Triumviri Reipublicae constituendae</hi> being either no Magistracy at all of the <hi>Roman</hi> State, or coincident with that of their Emperours; and being also declined in the enumeration of the Forms of Government by the <hi>Roman</hi> Historians, or else acknowledged of the Line of the Sixth Head, that is to say, of the Order of <hi>Emperors;</hi> it is plain that there was sufficient, if not a necessary, ground of not reckoning this <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umvirate</hi> amongst the Heads that had passed in S. <hi>John</hi>'s time, and that therefore the truth of History agrees exactly with the Vision that saith, <hi>Five are fallen,</hi> not <hi>Six,</hi> nor <hi>Seven.</hi> For no Historians reckon otherwise; and what can be more satisfactory, then that Prophecie speaks in the very language of History? Or what Harshness or <hi>Indecorum</hi> is it to conceive the Vision to number onely so many distinct Heads as are plainly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessedly both Heads and distinct, and are taken notice of up and down in History for the remarkable Governments of the <hi>Roman</hi> State, whenas those that are omitted in the Vision are also pretermitted in Historical Narrations, as either not agreed upon for distinct Heads, or disclaimed to be so?</p>
                        <p n="11">11. And truly if there had been any other Forms of Government that might have seemed to disturb this solemn Number of <hi>Seven,</hi> provided they had had a very near affinity with some or other of the <hi>chief Seven,</hi> they might have been reckoned as one with such as they had so near agreement to, and so the Beast be still <hi>Seven-headed,</hi> as <hi>Nilus</hi> Seven mouthed, those distinct Rivolets that flow near the main Streams of this Septemfluous River being reckoned as one with those principal ones, and <hi>Nilus</hi> never the less celebrated by the Epithets of <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap> up and down in Authentick Writers. Which liberty had been very tolerable, nay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed unexceptionable, in those <hi>Five</hi> Heads that already had passed, the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for the future, on which all the weight lies, being so certainly fixed in the <hi>Sixth,</hi> whose course was in the Apostle's time, that it could breed no disorder nor confusion.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. And yet we find a greater exactness then so. Whence it is manifest that we have the greatest assurance we can desire of the true sense of this Vision as to this point: forasmuch as we have above demonstrated that the <hi>Seven Heads</hi> of the Beast must be so understood as may reach through the whole Succession of Heads from the beginning to the end, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:42932:178"/>
must be the several Successions of so many <hi>Sorts</hi> of Supreme Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, not <hi>Seven single Persons;</hi> and then find also <hi>de facto</hi> that. Five of these Successions do so exquisitely fit the number of those <hi>Five</hi> Forms of Government which according to History were past in S. <hi>John</hi>'s time, and that the <hi>Sixth</hi> Government in succession, which is that of the <hi>Pagan Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours,</hi> was that very Head then in Being. Which things fall out so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately, that a man would think that <hi>Scepticism</hi> it self could scarce refrain giving assent to so plain a Truth.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. We have therefore made good that there are just <hi>Six</hi> sorts of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Powers from the beginning of the <hi>Roman</hi> Kingdom to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle's time, namely, <hi>Regal, Consular, Tribunitial, Decemviral, Dictato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial</hi> and <hi>Imperatorial.</hi> For that of the <hi>Interreges</hi> was a Regal Power, (if considerable at all) and therefore does naturally fall under the Type of one single Head; as that also of the <hi>Triumviri</hi> of constituting the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth (if it was not a state of war and confusion) was also an <hi>Imperato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial</hi> Power, though disguised under that other name, and therefore falls under the <hi>Sixth</hi> Head: as must needs seem very easie and natural to him that considers how Collective and <hi>Henopoetical,</hi> as I may so speak, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick Types are. The consideration of the Collectiveness and Unitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of which Types on the one side, and of the express and explicit enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration, in History, of <hi>Five</hi> distinct sorts of Government before the Emperours, on the other side, must necessarily cast a man into an unshaken security that the Spirit of Prophecy would reckon neither more nor fewer kinds of Governours before the <hi>Emperours</hi> then <hi>Five.</hi> Which point be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cleared, I pass to the second; which is, the more fully declaring how fitly and rightly that degenerate estate of the Empire which is prefigured by the <hi>Beast that was, and is not, and yet is,</hi> is also styled the <hi>Image of the Beast.</hi>

thereon; in adorning these Images; in appointing Festivals; in Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and Prayers; in Oblations of Wax-candles and Incense; in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying their Images in Procession, and hiding them in Lent. 9. In Vows, Oathes, Deifying deadmen, Pilgrimages, Miraculous Cures, with the Monuments of them hung up in the Temples. 10. In Asper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and Purifications by Holy Water. 11. In the driving away the Devil by the jangling of baptized Bells. 12. In their Jubilees and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral manner of celebrating their Festivals. 13. In fetching in <hi>May;</hi> in running about the fields with light Torches in their hands; in sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kling their Beasts with Holy Water by the Friars of S. <hi>Antony;</hi> in leaping over S. <hi>John</hi>'s Fires; in Baptismal Spittle; in their Master of Misrule at Christmas; in their Carnavals and other Festivals. 14. That the Image of the Beast is also in some sort revived in their Funerals. 15. But more considerably in their Religious Fraternities under this or that Saint: 16. As also in their shorn Crowns, in their Vows of Virginity, and in their <hi>Ninevites</hi> or <hi>Flagellants.</hi> 17. In their pretence of bringing down Christ bodily and personally at the Mass: 18, 19. As also in their more pompous Processions. 20. The great Use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of the Observation of the punctual correspondency of the Events hitherto to the Predictions touching the state of the Church. 21. His amazement and astonishment at <hi>Grotius,</hi> that he should decline so clear and easie a meaning of the <hi>Image of the Beast,</hi> and take up with one so impossible and so unprofitable.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p n="1">1. I Must confess that the mere changing of the Empire into a Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and Idolatrous condition again, though there were not either any study of, or heedless coincidence with, the particular Modes of that Idolatry and Superstition that was before, yet for the general Agreement therein the Empire thus relapsed might be rightly said to be the <hi>Image</hi> of the former state thereof. But since there is a more particular Resemblance even to Affectation, or else by a strange Fatality, it will not be amiss to note some few of those many Instances that occurre, for the greater light and fuller assurance that by the <hi>Image of the Beast</hi> is understood this Idolatrous and Paganly-Superstitious Relapse.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. And truly that this <hi>Image</hi> was not made by chance, but by imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, has been already observed even by them that lived in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and who in some sort justifi'd it: as <hi>Polydore Virgil</hi> in his Prooeme to his five last Books <hi>De Rerum Inventoribus;</hi> where he says that the Fathers did receive their Rites and Ceremonies from the Pagans; <hi>sed in bona illorum parte recipienda piè ac cum causa fecisse, quippe qui gentes etiam barbaras ad verae pietatis cultum ducere aventes, arbitrati sunt humanitatis condimentis tractandas, cùm earum instituta haud pror<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus horruerint nec sustulerint, sed meliora fecerint, quò nè ullum religionis periculum crearetur,</hi> &amp;c. Where he seems to speak the sense of <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great in his Epistle to <hi>Mellitus;</hi> where he would have the Offerings <note place="margin">Lib. 9. Epist. 71.</note> to <hi>Daemons</hi> rather changed then abolished, and that the Feasts of the Gods should be turned into the celebration of the Festivals of the Saints; the Repository of whose <hi>Reliques</hi> he would (after the manner of the Pagans)
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:42932:179"/>
have adorned with leaves and boughs of Trees at the Days dedicated to their Name. And <hi>Theodoret</hi> bluntly confesses, That the Festivals of <note place="margin">
                              <hi>De</hi> Curaendis Grac. Affect. <hi>Sermon.</hi> 8.</note> S. <hi>Peter,</hi> S. <hi>Paul,</hi> S. <hi>Marcellus,</hi> S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> &amp;c. succeed in the room of the <hi>Dionysia, Diasia, Pandia,</hi> and other Solemnities of the Pagans. Which shews a timely affectation of <hi>reviving the slain Beast,</hi> in every limb and proportion.</p>
                        <p>And, lastly, <hi>Durandus</hi> takes so little shame at the imitation of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenish Customs, that he is not content to compare their Dedication of Churches with the Temple of the Jews, but immediately addes the Example of the Dedication of that <hi>Babylonish</hi> Image in <hi>Daniel, Nabuchodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nosor etiam Rex vocavit omnes Satrapas &amp; Optimates ad Dedicationem Statuae aureae quam fecerat.</hi> Which had been more fit to mention in the Consecration of Images. But not to trouble our selves with their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions, the effect will declare their propension to the ancient Heathenish Rites and Customs; as I shall make plain by several brief Instances.</p>
                        <p n="3">3.

It were end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less to enter into a reckoning up so great a variety, and needless, it being so well known to all. And truly the now Roman Church falls little short of this copious particularity; for what is it that they have not a <hi>Saint</hi> for, as well as the ancient Pagans a <hi>God</hi> or a <hi>Goddess,</hi> nay it may be more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly then they? For one general God of Physick will not serve their turns, not one <hi>Apollo,</hi> or rather one <hi>Aesculapius,</hi> but as many peculiar Saints as there are Diseases: S. <hi>Roch</hi> for the Pestilence, S. <hi>Cosmus</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian</hi> for Biles and Tumors, S. <hi>Job</hi> for the Pox, S. <hi>Apollonia</hi> for the Tooth-ach, S. <hi>Clare</hi> to clear the eyes, S. <hi>Agatha</hi> for sore Breasts, S. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet</hi> for Midwifery, S. <hi>Petronella</hi> for Agues, S. <hi>John</hi> and S. <hi>Valentine</hi> for the Falling-sickness, S. <hi>Benedict</hi> for Poison, S. <hi>Genoa</hi> for the Gout, S. <hi>Main</hi> for Scabs, S. <hi>Phiacre</hi> for the Emerods, S. <hi>Sigismund</hi> for the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and S. <hi>Eutrope</hi> for the Dropsie; with several others which were too tedious to rehearse.</p>
                        <p>As the Pagans also had several Rural Deities, so has the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> several Rural Saints: as S. <hi>Wendelin</hi> for Shepherds, S. <hi>Pelage</hi> for Neatherds, S. <hi>Anthony</hi> for Swineherds, S. <hi>Loy</hi> for Horses and Kine, S. <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riol</hi> for Geese, S. <hi>John</hi> for Lambs, S. <hi>Hubert</hi> for Huntsmen and their Dogs; S. <hi>Gertrude</hi> also has a special power over Rats and Mice.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. The old Roman Paganism had <hi>Mercury</hi> for the God of Tradesmen, as his name also intimates, and he was likewise the God of popular Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; but the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> seems more accurate that has assigned a Saint to almost every Trade: S. <hi>Honorius</hi> for Bakers, S. <hi>Eloy</hi> for Smiths, S. <hi>Luke</hi> for Painters, S. <hi>Nicolas</hi> for Mariners, S. <hi>Ive</hi> for Lawyers, S. <hi>Crispin</hi> for Shoe-makers, S. <hi>Arnold</hi> for Millers, S. <hi>Stephen</hi> for Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, S. <hi>Euloge</hi> for Carpenters, S. <hi>Goodman</hi> for Tailors, S. <hi>Goar</hi> for Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers, and S. <hi>Urban</hi> for Ale-Knights or Pot-Companions, as well as S. <hi>Magdalen</hi> for Curtisans. It were an infinite task to make such long Inductions as the matter is capable of; this is enough to shew how fully
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:42932:180"/>
that ancient Pagan Theologie is revived in these appropriated Offices of the Saints, and how requisite the knowledge may be pretended thereof; as <hi>Varro</hi> of old defined concerning the Heathenish Gods, how advantageous it were <hi>si sciatur quam quisque Deus vim &amp; potestatem habeat cujusque rei,</hi> that accordingly he might be invoked.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. It were an easie thing also, but superfluous, to parallel these Saints to the Pagan <hi>Divi</hi> in their Offices: for thus S. <hi>Nicolas</hi> would be <hi>Divus Neptunus;</hi> S. <hi>Margaret, Diva Lucina;</hi> S. <hi>Magdalen, Diva Flora;</hi> and S. <hi>Martin, Divus Bacchus;</hi> S. <hi>Hubert, Diva Diana;</hi> and S. <hi>Maturin, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus Apollo:</hi> For the God of Wisedom should be the best Physician for Fools.</p>
                        <p>But the <hi>Blessed Virgin,</hi> as they call her <hi>Regina Coeli,</hi> so she will have as many Offices and Titles as the <hi>Moon.</hi> For they make her <hi>Juno Lucina,</hi> by invoking her so constantly in child-birth; and then <hi>Hecate</hi> or <hi>Proser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pina,</hi> by feigning her so frequently to descend into the lower shades to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver Souls out of Purgatory. And the Mariners, by calling on her so frequently in storms, thrust her also into the place of <hi>Venus,</hi> as is plain in that rhyming Supplication they put up to her in their Sea-voiages:
<q>
                              <l>Salve, splendor Firmamenti,</l>
                              <l>Tu caliginosae menti</l>
                              <l>Desuper irradia.</l>
                              <l>Placa mare, maris stella,</l>
                              <l>Nè involvat nos procella</l>
                              <l>Et tempestas obvia.</l>
                           </q>
And, lastly, mens lavish devotion to her on land, in building her so many Temples and Altars, has made her goe under as many Names or more then that Pagan Goddess. For as <hi>Venus</hi> is called <hi>Idalia, Cytherea, Cni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia, Paphia,</hi> and many more such like Names, from the places where she is worshipped; so the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> is called Our Lady of <hi>Loretto,</hi> Our Lady of <hi>Bononia,</hi> of <hi>Aix,</hi> of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> Our Lady of <hi>Carmel,</hi> Our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the <hi>Woods,</hi> of the <hi>Fields,</hi> and of the <hi>Fountains,</hi> with innumerable other Appellations. But these things are less considerable.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. This revived Image of the old Paganism of <hi>Rome</hi> is still more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in <hi>building of Temples</hi> to these several kinds of <hi>new Gods,</hi> (for so every thing is made that has religious worship done to it) or in <hi>doing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious worship</hi> to them in the Temples of the old ones, as is notorious in their consecrating the <hi>Pantheon</hi> to the <hi>Blessed Virgin and all the Saints,</hi> which was by the Pagans dedicated to <hi>Cybele and all the Gods.</hi> Which is a trim stroke of this <hi>Revived Image of the Beast.</hi> And that comes little short of it which <hi>Cornelius à Lapide</hi> also has noted, That as under the <hi>Roman</hi> Kings the Seven Hills were consecrated <hi>singuli singulis Diis, ità nunc singuli singulis Sanctis.</hi> Which is another lively lineament of this pourtraiture predicted by S. <hi>John.</hi>

                        <p>It was a custome among the Pagans in the solemnization of the Feasts of their Gods, <hi>Deos induere,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s phrase is, for some one or other to sustain the person or act the part of that God whose Feast they celebrated. That this custome also obtained in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the Festivals of their Saints, I have been particularly informed, some one acting the part of the Saint, to entertain the people with Pass-time, or a kinde of superstitious Merriment.

                        <p n="16">16. Onely we cannot omit the taking notice that <hi>shorn Crowns</hi> is no modern invention, but a Ceremony of the ancient Priests of <hi>Isis</hi> or <hi>Diana:</hi> nor the <hi>Vow of Virginity</hi> so late as to be appropriate to the Nuns of the now <hi>Romane</hi> Religion, since <hi>Vesta, Apollo, Juno Argiva, Diana</hi> and <hi>Minerva</hi>'s Priests were condemned to perpetual Virginity; and the Priests of <hi>Cybele</hi> the Mother of the Gods made sure of a constant Coelibate by execting their virilities. This I must confess is not imitated to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actness in <hi>New Rome,</hi> but Chastity is vowed with so much confidence as if they had either made themselves <hi>Eunuchs</hi> in <hi>Origen</hi>'s literal sense, or else had been born <hi>Eunuchs</hi> for the Kingdom of God. But as they fall short of the <hi>Galli,</hi> so have they out-done the <hi>Luperci</hi> in their <hi>Ninevites</hi> and <hi>Flagellants,</hi> whose stripes are not laid upon them they meet, but upon themselves.

then in an ordinary manner present: But to pretend to bring down the Humane and Bodily presence of Christ from Heaven into a Church or Chappel by a certain form of words, is to revive the Beast in that remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able part of Pagan Imposture and Superstition which was called <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>The Pagans in their superstitious and idolatrous <hi>Processionary</hi> pomps <note place="margin">De rerum In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent. lib. 6. c 11.</note> carried the Images of their Gods, but for the better entertaining of the rude people there went also in this Procession a certain ludicrous Image which the Latines call <hi>Citeria:</hi> they ordinarily derive it from <gap reason="foreign">

Plautus</hi> makes mention of another formidable Idol that was carried in these super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious shows, which he calls <hi>Manducus; Quid si ad ludos me pro Manduco locem, quapropter clarè crepito dentibus?</hi> For it was an huge ugly Image with a wide mouth riven up to the ears, and gaping horribly, and making a gnashing and snapping with its teeth to the great terrour of the simple. Of this <hi>Mormo</hi> is that of <hi>Juvenal,</hi> who saith that it scares the children of the Rusticks in their Mother's bosome, by its wide gapings:
<q>

                        </p>
                        <p>But afterwards there is a more continued Description of this Pagan su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious pomp out of <hi>Apuleius.</hi> 
                           <q>Behold, saith he, the <hi>Anteludia</hi> of this great Procession leisurely marching on. Here one playing the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier with his sword and belt about him, there another acting the Hunts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with his short Coat girt close, with a wood-knife or faucheon at his side, and hunting-pole in his hand. Another clad in purple acts the Supreme Magistrate, and has the <hi>Fasces</hi> carried before him. I have seen also, saith he, a tame Bear dressed up like a Lady, carried in an Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litter, and an Ape with a woven cap on his head. But after these come on with a slow pace the peculiar pomp of the <hi>Goddess</hi> herself, (sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose <hi>Diana</hi> or the <hi>Moon)</hi> women dressed up in white clothing atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding her in various gestures of pleasantry and mirth, with crowns of flowers upon their heads, strewing the ground along as they went with odoriferous herbs and flowers out of their laps, for the Processionary pomp of the Goddess to pass over. And another great company of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sex followed with light Torches, Lamps, and Wax-candles. After whom march on the Musicians sweetly playing on Flutes and Pipes; and next to these a company of Dancers youthfully clothed in white Apparrel bright and shining like snow. There were also Heralds, who by Proclamation spoke to the people to give way, that the Pomp might not be impeded by any rudeness or crowding, nor any look down out of their windows upon them.</q> Such were the Religious Pomps and Proces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of the ancient Pagans.</p>

19. Let us now transcribe the manner of certain <hi>Processions</hi> or Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> out of the same <hi>Polydore,</hi> who could not be ignorant of those Rites. <q>In the Pomp, saith he, of our Supplications or <hi>Processions</hi> there uses some ludicrous show to precede, as Ranks of Souldiers, Horse and Foot, or some snapping and chattering Image, ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous and loquacious, or else gaping with wide chaps, and making a gnashing noise with its teeth, very formidable to behold; with other sportful sights, amongst which the ancient Prophets are personated, and Boies with wings goe singing as if they were of the Heavenly Quire of Angels: whom immediately follows a company of men and women dancing after their Musick. Here one acts <hi>David,</hi> there another <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon:</hi> Some play the parts of Queens and Princesses, others of Hunts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Beasts also are brought into the Pomp, and there an Ape or Monkey, with a <hi>Munmouth</hi> Cap button'd up on one side, bestrides some big Mastiff or bedwarsed Nag. There are also men carrying Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in their hands, and Boies and Girls are forbid to look out of the Windows. Besides, the Priests or some others sustain the persons or act the parts of this or that Saint, they carrying also their Images or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques along with them in the Procession. The air also is filled with odours as they goe, and the ground they pass over strew'd with flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. And lastly, to some is appointed the office of speaking to the people to give way that the Pomp may march on without any impediment.</q> Can there be one Egge more like to another then this <hi>Romish Procession</hi> is to the ancient superstitious Pomp of the Pagans? Wherefore <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore</hi>'s inference is very solid and unexceptionable, <hi>Ità Romani factita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant &amp; aliae pleraeque gentes, à quibus ad nos ritus ejusmodi dubio procul manavit.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="20">20. Thus fully has this ancient Pagan Empire, the slain Beast, reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered into life again, and so completely is his Image made up by the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel and direction of the <hi>Two-horned</hi> Beast or the <hi>False Prophet.</hi> Nor can I, while I consider it, but with bended knee adore that Divine Providence that watches so punctually over humane Affairs, and with all possible thanks and humility acknowledge the tender care and faithfulness of the Lord <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> our great Pastor, that has so exquisitely prefigured the state of the Church, and told us afore-hand how things would be with her for a time; that the truth of these Events may give us a more sure pledge of the certainty of her Restauration to her pristine Apostolical Purity, according as he has predicted in the same Prophetick Visions.</p>

which, as <hi>Bede</hi> complains, was the condition of the Primitive Christians, that would not submit to the Idolatries of Paganism, and which is the real fate of them under the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> that declare against their <hi>Pagano-Christianism;</hi> nay, they make Inquisition to take away the lives of poor harmless men, and hunt after the bloud of the innocent, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, rack, and burn with fire and fagot those that refuse to commit Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry with them: I say, the likeness and similitude that the state of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church bears to ancient Paganism in <hi>Idolatry, Superstition</hi> and <hi>Cruelty,</hi> (to say nothing of their <hi>lying Miracles</hi> and <hi>Impostures,)</hi> is so complete, and the <hi>Pagano-Christian</hi> Empire so lively an Image every way of that which was once purely Pagan, that I cannot but devoutly admire the exact veracity of these Divine Visions in so material a Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; but withall wonder excessively, and am even amazed, at <hi>Grotius,</hi> when the event of things is so full and adequate, so fit and exquisitely accommodate to this Interpretation of the Image of the Beast, that a man of his Wit and Learning should content himself with one so petty, so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, so impossible, so unprofitable, as that which he has made choice of, and which I will now more fully confute, after I have shew'd the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of <hi>Ribera</hi>'s Interpretation.</p>

                           <p>1. The great Usefulness of shewing the folly of <hi>Ribera</hi>'s and <hi>Grotius</hi> his Expositions of these two Chapters of the <hi>Apocalyps.</hi> 2. That, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Ribera,</hi> the Beast is the Devil. 3. The seven Kings the wicked Kings of the seven Ages of the world. 4.

The general Use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of our Joint-Exposition. 6. That the Beast is not the Devil, proved there-from by several circumstances: Nor the seven Heads seven such Ages, by the deadly wound in the sixth Head. 7. Nor the Whore <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen more then the Two-horned Beast. 8.

A confutation of <hi>Ribera</hi>'s Exposition of the seven Heads from the groundlesness and exceptionableness of his division of the duration of the world into seven Ages. 11. From the Ununitableness of the Kings of the Age into one Head. 12. From the Devil's eminency and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority over these Heads. 13. From the leaving neither room nor time for an eighth King. 14. From the disproportionableness of the seventh Age of the world to the rest, and especially to the strange Feats they say Antichrist is then to atchieve. 15. And, lastly, from the seven Hills necessarily appropriating those seven Heads to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. 16. That these Expositions of <hi>Ribera,</hi> as also of the rest of the Roman Interpreters, were very weak even in <hi>Grotius</hi> his own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which set him upon minting new ones.</p>

2. <hi>Ribera</hi>'s Exposition of the <hi>Beast with seven Heads and ten Horns, that was, and is not, and yet is,</hi> and of <hi>the Whore of Babylon</hi> that rides on him, is briefly this. <q>The <hi>Beast</hi> is the <hi>Devil,</hi> considered in reference to his condition of reigning or not reigning in the world. <hi>In Bestia non Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolus intelligitur, sed Diabolus regnans.</hi> Wherefore whereas it is said, <hi>The Beast which thou sawest, was, and is not,</hi> he interprets it thus: The Devil in the foregoing Ages before Christ was <hi>Diabolus regnans,</hi> but in S. <hi>John</hi>'s time he was not <hi>Diabolus regnans,</hi> because then <hi>the Prince of this world was cast out.</hi> And therefore in this sense he is said to be <hi>the Beast that was, and is not,</hi> but will be <hi>Diabolus regnans</hi> again in Antichrist, which is the Seventh Head, in whose reign he comes up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain out of the bottomless pit.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. <q>The Seven Kings are the wicked Kings of the Seven Ages of the world, from <hi>Adam</hi> to the last Judgement. The first Age is from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Noe,</hi> in which <hi>Cain</hi> and the Giants are particularly taxed. The second from <hi>Noe</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> wherein <hi>Nimrod</hi> is perstringed. The third from <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> wherein the Kings of <hi>Aegypt</hi> and other people are noted for Persecutours and Opposers of the People of God. The fourth from <hi>David</hi> to the Captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> wherein the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Jews were much afflicted by the Kings of <hi>Assyria.</hi> The fifth from the Captivity of <hi>Babylon</hi> to the coming of Christ, wherein they were much afflicted by the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> and <hi>Greeks.</hi> The sixth from the coming of Christ to the coming of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> wherein the Church has been much persecuted by the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours and by the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Saracens,</hi> and may be still more by such as may arise here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. The seventh from the coming of Antichrist to the last Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherein Antichrist with his ten Horns, that is ten Kings, shall persecute the Church worse then ever.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. <q>Five of these Heads, that is, of these Ages with their wicked Kings, were gone over in S. <hi>John</hi>'s time: one Age was then and still continues: the other, that is the Seventh and Last, is not yet come, but when it is once come, it must continue but a little while, that is to say, three years and an half, or fourty two months; Antichrist being that Beast in the thirteenth Chapter, according as he interprets it. And lastly, for</q> the Whore that rides this <hi>Beast that was, and is not,</hi> he says it is <hi>Rome Heathen.</hi> This is a clear and faithfull Proposall of <hi>Ribera</hi>'s Exposition, as any one may see that will have recourse to him upon the place. Let us now see how much or rather how little truth there is in it.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. In the Examination whereof, as also of the following Exposition, we may discern the Usefulness of our demonstrating so plainly That one and the same thing absolutely is understood by the <hi>Seven-headed Beast</hi> in the Thirteenth Chapter and by the <hi>Seven-headed Beast</hi> in the Seventeenth, as also by the <hi>Whore of Babylon</hi> and the <hi>Two-horned Beast.</hi> For this even of it self will easily detect the Trivialities and Faulterings of these Expositions.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. That the <hi>Beast that was, and is not,</hi> cannot be <hi>Regnum Diaboli</hi> (as <hi>Ribera</hi> speaks) <hi>vel Diabolus regnans in mundo per sua membra, qui ab initio fere mundi regnare capit in hominibus,</hi> is demonstrable from the Beast with seven Heads in the thirteenth Chapter, which is the same Beast,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:42932:186"/>
and whose time of continuance is but fourty two months. Which is a sign that <hi>Ribera</hi> is quite out of the story. For the same numericall Beast must have the same duration of time. Again, he makes the Beast in the Thirteenth Chapter to be <hi>Antichrist,</hi> but this the <hi>Devil:</hi> which is another faultering in his narration. But further, whenas the Beast in the Thirteenth Chapter is said to <hi>come out of the Sea,</hi> it is plain, according to the usual meaning of that Type in the Prophetick style, that it is a Body Politick consisting of Men: But how can the <hi>Devil</hi> be such with his dark Legions? they are not <hi>Men,</hi> but <hi>Devils,</hi> nor to be <hi>led captive,</hi> nor to be <hi>killed with the sword,</hi> as it is said of the Beast there mentioned. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the Dragon, that is, the Devil, is said to <hi>deliver his forces to the Seven-headed Beast</hi> in that Chapter; how then can the <hi>Beast</hi> be the <hi>Devil?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To all which you may adde, That the <hi>Sixth</hi> Head of the Beast in that Chapter is wounded to death, not to be healed till the Revival of the Beast and the Recovery of him in the <hi>Seventh</hi> Head. But how can the wicked Kings of the Sixth Age be said to be wounded to death, or the Beast not to revive till the Seventh Head, when the Church of Christ has been so dreadfully persecuted in the Primitive Times, and is to this very day so cruelly infested by the <hi>Turks,</hi> as heretofore by the <hi>Saracens?</hi> These actions are no signs of the Sixth Head being <hi>wounded to death</hi> more then the foregoing Heads, nor so much neither. Lastly, how can the Devil in this Seventeenth Chapter be the <hi>Image of the restored Beast</hi> that had received the deadly wound? For the Devil when he is again regnant will not <hi>Pagano-christianize,</hi> as I may so speak, but grosly Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize, or Judaize, as our Adversaries confess; and therefore will not be an <hi>Image,</hi> but either the Thing it self, or not so much as an Image, but a Thing quite different.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. And for the <hi>Whore that rides on the Beast,</hi> I might demand in what sense <hi>Rome Heathen</hi> has <hi>two Horns like a Lamb;</hi> with other such en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries, which for brevity sake I omit. I will rather take notice how inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corous it is to phansy <hi>Rome Heathen</hi> to ride the Devil, whenas it is more proper to conceive her rid, that is to say, guided and acted and instigated by him.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. But that <hi>the Beast that was, and is not,</hi> is not the Devil, we shall now evince by other arguments without relation to the Thirteenth Chapter. As, first, If the Devil be a Beast, that which makes him so is the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his nature, his persecutiveness of the Church of God, and his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour of erecting against him a Kingdom of Idolaters. Now the Devil has never ceased to be such from the beginning of the world to this very day. This is the very nature of the Beast, and his nature is not yet slain in him, nor ever was, nor ever will be. Wherefore it never was nor ever will be true of him, That he is <hi>the Beast that was, and is not.</hi> For to be regnant and then cease to be regnant, does not make him to be a Beast and then no Beast, but onely no regnant Beast. But that also is false, that he has yet at any time ceased to be a regnant Beast.</p>
                        <p>For till Christ came he reigned over all the World, excepting the Jews. After Christ came, he tyrannized over the Christians for about three hundred years. And after the Empire in a manner wholly turned Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:42932:186"/>
yet the Kingdom of the Devil was no less then all the Habitable world besides, in comparison whereof the other is but a small spot of ground; and yet what great slices have been pared off therefrom? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides his Rule in Christendom it self by superinducing so universal a spirit of Antichristianism into it, consisting of gross Idolatries and bloudy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions of the dear Servants of God. Now let any one consider and say whether the Devil be <hi>Bestia non regnans,</hi> or <hi>regnans</hi> in the world from Christ's time to this day: and how groundless an Interpretation this of <hi>Ribera</hi>'s is, that understands the <hi>Beast that was, and is not,</hi> of the Devil at large, and not of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire in such a sense as we have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded it.</p>
                        <p>For that it is the <hi>Fourth Empire</hi> which is the <hi>Roman,</hi> the <hi>ten Horns</hi> do plainly indicate, which are the Ensigns of the Fourth Beast in <hi>Daniel,</hi> which I think no man has been yet so grosly extravagant as to interpret of the Devil.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. Besides, this Beast is not onely styled <hi>The Beast that was, and is not,</hi> but there is also added to his Title <hi>[and yet is.]</hi> Which whole Title cannot be true of the Devil regnant in Antichrist's time according to <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bera</hi>'s sense. For he being then regnant, he is the very same Devil in every respect, and a man cannot say he <hi>is not</hi> regnant, though it be then true that he <hi>is.</hi> So that part of the Title onely will agree to him, namely that <hi>he was, and is.</hi> Which is another plain detection of the falsness of <hi>Ribera</hi>'s Exposition.</p>
                        <p>Nor is there any Evasion in the various readings. For Copies generally have it, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, Which seems such a contradiction, that it has made some leave out <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, and others turn it into <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaching the meaning of the Apostle. But seeing this reading we fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low so generally obtains, notwithstanding its seeming harshness and contradictiousness, it is an unexceptionable argument that it is the true and genuine reading indeed, and that merely the undubitable authentickness of Copies has made it bear down the other two readings which the over-much boldness and unskilfulness of some had ventured to cast into the place of the true one.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. Again, concerning his Exposition of the <hi>Seven Heads,</hi> many things are to be objected. As first, That his dividing the whole duration of the World into Seven Ages is a thing groundless and merely arbitrarious, there being nothing either in Tradition or Scripture to countenance it. There is indeed an ancient Tradition of <hi>Elias,</hi> that divides the duration of the World into four parts, <hi>Two thousand years Vacuity, Two thousand the Law,</hi> and <hi>Two thousand the Messias,</hi> and then the <hi>great Sabbatism.</hi> But of such a division as <hi>Ribera</hi> has made here there is no News nor Example in Antiquity. And in the steps he takes, he has very unmannerly troden over the head of <hi>Moses,</hi> as if he was not a man great enough to be taken notice of amongst the Joints of this Division; whenas certainly he is one of the most eminent <hi>Epocha's</hi> of time, as appears by that Tradition of <hi>Elias,</hi> and therefore ought to have been mentioned before he came to <hi>David:</hi> As also <hi>Enoch,</hi> so famous for his Assumption into Heaven, his Birth ought to have been noted before he came to <hi>Noe.</hi> Besides other as justifiable Divisions which were easy to observe. But these short intimations may
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:42932:187"/>
suffice to shew how lubricous and fictitious a Comment, <hi>Ribera</hi>'s Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition is in this regard.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. But, secondly, How can the Kings in each one of these Ages, having no subordination to one another, but being absolute and absolutely disjoin'd in their respective Kingdoms, or rather having no political Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination or Correspondence as Heads of one Body Politick, how can they make up <hi>but one Head</hi> for an Age? There is no warrant nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of any such thing in the Prophetick style. But if you will say they are <hi>one Head,</hi> because they belong to one Body, the <hi>Devil,</hi> all the whole Succession of wicked and persecutive Kings throughout all these Ages will be <hi>but one Head</hi> upon this account, and so the Beast will have but One Head, not Seven. For distance of time and Succession makes no difference of Heads nor Beasts in the Prophetick style, but some distinction of nature in them.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. Thirdly, It is very harsh and incongruous to make these wicked Kings the Heads of the Devil, whenas the Devil is their Prince and Head; he being above them both in his preeminency of Nature, as being an Angel, though but a wicked one, and they but wicked Men; as also by right of Jurisdiction, all those that are Rebells to the Kingdom of God making an Accession to the Kingdom of the Devil. So that the Exposition in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect is as harsh and preposterous as the painting of an Horse with his Head on his <hi>Coccyx,</hi> and his Tail hanging down before his Breast.
<q>
                              <l>Spectatum admissi risum teneatis, amici?</l>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p n="13">13. Fourthly, If the Seven Kings be the wicked Kings of the Seven Ages of the world even to the very day of Judgment, what is that Eighth King? and what Age of the world will he be in? For there seems neither room nor time left for him. Why, truly <hi>Ribera</hi> has pitched upon a very subtil Merchant, who will insinuate into all times and places (if it be possible) for his own advantage. <hi>This Eighth King,</hi> saith he, <hi>is the Devil.</hi> But the Devil, say I, is the Beast, according to his own Hypothesis, and this Eighth is said to be one of the Seven Heads. But how can one and the same be both the whole Beast, and yet but one of the Heads thereof? Wherefore it is plain that his Exposition in this regard is against common sense and the very first Notions of humane Understanding.</p>
                        <p n="14">14. Fifthly, The Seventh Age of the world, which is the measure of the Reign of Antichrist, is most ridiculously disproportioned to the rest, it being but three years and an half, as <hi>Ribera</hi> has computed it. Which yet were more tolerable, if it were well proportionated to those great Exploits that Antichrist is to doe in that short space. For he is to subdue all the World, or, if you will, the Ten Kings which they feign will be the Rulers over the whole World when Antichrist begins to lay about him. For having first made an Expedition against Three Kings, namely, the King of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> the King of <hi>Libya</hi> and the King of <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> &amp; overcome them and slain them, the other Seven shall submit to him, and become the Seven Heads of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, the first of which being mortally wounded in his service, he shall miraculously raise him from the dead. Thus by a wonderfull Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phosis have they changed the Ten Horns into Seven Heads, and made the Horns of Antichrist to grow before the Heads. So pitifully are they put to it in their prevaricatory Expositions of the Oracles of God.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="341" facs="tcp:42932:187"/>
And not content to adorn this great Potentate with that one single Miracle of raising the slain from the dead, they also allow him a power of literally bringing down fire from Heaven, and of making his own Statue to speak. His Royal Palace they place in <hi>Judaea,</hi> and derive his Pedigree from the Tribe of <hi>Dan,</hi> and make his Throne the very Temple of God at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and proclaim him the expected <hi>Messias</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> to whom they are all to gather themselves. He must besiege <hi>Rome,</hi> and burn it, and call to himself the Nations from all the Quarters of the Earth, to conspire the utter Extirpation of the Christian Name from under the Cope of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and, as it seems, notwithstanding all the vigilancy of the Pope and his whole Conclave of Cardinals and their active Emissaries and all the Forces of Christendom, will in a manner wholly effect it: and all this, which is the Miracle of Miracles, within the space of three years and an half. Nay, which is still more miraculous, This <hi>quadrimular Antichrist</hi> shall not onely over-run Christendom, but subdue the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> over-run the <hi>Persian,</hi> make the <hi>Tartarian Cham</hi> submit to him in the North, and extort Homage from the remotest Kingdoms of <hi>Africa.</hi> Which is such a piece of Prophetick Fabulosity as no man would ever vent in the most Romantick History. So incredible therefore is this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of <hi>Ribera</hi> in this regard also concerning the Seven Heads of the Beast.</p>
                        <p n="15">15. Sixthly and lastly, To that Beast onely to whom the <hi>Seven Hills</hi> belong some way or other, can the <hi>Seven Kings</hi> appertain; for both are said to be signifi'd by the <hi>Seven Heads</hi> of the Beast, and therefore both have a proper and peculiar reference to him: for they being his Typical Heads, to him must needs appertain what they are said to typifie. But it is plain that the <hi>Seven Hills</hi> appertain to the <hi>Roman</hi> Beast, that is, to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire: Therefore it is necessary that the <hi>Seven Kings</hi> likewise appertain thereunto. From whence it will follow, that these Kings cannot be the Kings of the Seven Ages of the world. For <hi>Rome</hi> was not built till about <hi>Anno Mundi</hi> 3200, when even the Fourth Age of the World, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Ribera</hi>'s own reckoning, was almost expired. So impossible every way is this Exposition of his, and against all sense and reason. And yet it is the very best the <hi>Romanists</hi> have, and in which they think they have the safest shelter, as appears in <hi>Cornelius à Lapide</hi> and <hi>Lessius</hi> his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering thereto rather then any other they have hitherto lighted upon.</p>
                        <p n="16">16. The weakness of all which Expositions <hi>Grotius,</hi> as it seems, friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commiserating, has minted one of a-new at his own Forge; which though we have else-where in some sort examined already and found light and adulterate, yet it being a matter of so great moment, we will give it a second Trial; wherein if it be again found manifestly salse, and more fully detected to abound with gross Incongruities and Impossibilities, I cannot imagine any thing omitted, for the giving us the greatest assurance that any one can desire of the truth of that Exposition we have made of these Seventeenth and Thirteenth Chapters of the <hi>Apocalyps.</hi>

                        <argument>
                           <p>1. What the meaning of the <hi>Scarlet Beast with seven Heads and ten Horns,</hi> and of the <hi>Woman riding him,</hi> is according to <hi>Grotius.</hi> 2. A Confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Grotius</hi> his Interpretation, out of our Joint-Exposition. 3. Two main Grounds or necessary Supporters of <hi>Grotius</hi> his Interpretation: The one, That S. <hi>John</hi> reckons the Seven Heads beginning at <hi>Claudius;</hi> with the Confutation thereof. 4. The other, That this Vision was wrote in <hi>Vespasian</hi>'s time; with a Discovery of the weakness and falseness of that Opinion. 5. That <hi>Claudius</hi> his banishing the <hi>Jews</hi> from <hi>Rome</hi> falls many degrees short of a proof, that <hi>John</hi> was then exiled into <hi>Patmos:</hi> And that <hi>Impulsore Christo</hi> in <hi>Suetonius</hi> does not so much as evince that any Christians were then expelled the City. 6. And if the Decree reached Christians, it does not strait follow that S. <hi>John</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned therein. 7. An Answer to a Passage in <hi>Epiphanius</hi> alledged for S. <hi>John</hi>'s Exile then. 8. An Answer to another alledged to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. 9. That <hi>Epiphanius</hi> his Testimony makes against <hi>Grotius</hi> his main Project. 10. That <hi>Epiphanius</hi> is but one single Father against the rest, and that the Testimony of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> alone is far to be preferred before his. 11. An unexceptionable clearing of the sense of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his Testimony; and that the very detorsion of it will not serve <hi>Grotius</hi> his turn. 12. That there is not the least shadow of Probability that the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> was wrote before toward the end of <hi>Domitian</hi>'s reign. 13. Proofs out of the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> it self, that it was not wrote before the Persecution under <hi>Domitian.</hi> 14. The great consequence of the clearing this Truth, it wholly subverting all <hi>Grotius</hi> his Interpretations of the <hi>Seals</hi> and <hi>Trumpets</hi> and all their <hi>Synchronals.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </argument>
                        <p n="1">1. LEt us therefore more accurately examine <hi>Grotius</hi> his Interpretation; the summe whereof is this: <q>The <hi>Scarlet Beast</hi> ridden by the <hi>Whore of Babylon</hi> is the old <hi>Roman</hi> Idolatry guided and dispensed by the ancient Ethnick <hi>Roman</hi> State or Domination, as he calls it. The Seven Heads of the Beast are seven <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours, <hi>Claudius, Nero, Galba, Otho, Vitellius;</hi> which five were fallen when S. <hi>John</hi> had this Vision, or at the least wrote it, as <hi>Grotius</hi> supposes. But <hi>Vespasian</hi> was then reigning: <hi>Titus,</hi> the seventh, was not yet come; and when he was come, he was to continue but a while. But the <hi>Beast that was, and is not,</hi> and is the <hi>Eighth</hi> King, and consequently an <hi>Eighth</hi> Head, that's <hi>Domitian,</hi> who, as <hi>Grotius</hi> pretends, reigned first in his Father <hi>Vespasian</hi>'s absence, but receding from the government of the Empire at <hi>Vespasian</hi>'s return, was then <hi>the Beast that was, but is not,</hi> but was after to emerge and resume the Empire again after <hi>Vespasian</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> his reign, and to die a violent death. The <hi>Ten Horns,</hi> he saith, are Ten Kings which were not as yet (that is, in S. <hi>John</hi>'s time) <hi>in side &amp; reverentia Imperii Romani,</hi> but should be for a time: And those, saith he, were the <hi>Ostrogotthi, Wisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotthi, Vandali, Gepidae, Longobardi, Heruli, Burgundiones, Hunni, Franci, Angli</hi> sive <hi>Saxones.</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <pb n="343" facs="tcp:42932:188"/>
2. These are the main strokes of <hi>Grotius</hi> his Interpretation of the Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Chapter of the <hi>Apocalyps:</hi> the general lineaments of which not answering to those of the Thirteenth, may make it upon that very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count suspicable to those that duly consider what great presumption there is, or rather demonstration, that these two Chapters handle the very self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same things, but are so contrived, that the one may give light to the other.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore the Dragon in the Twelfth Chapter, with <hi>seven Heads bearing seven Crowns,</hi> (which plainly shew that the signification of <hi>Kings,</hi> not <hi>Hills,</hi> is there to be understood) being wounded to death in one of his Heads in that fight, and healed so that all wondred after him, I would demand of <hi>Grotius,</hi> which of these Emperours was wounded to death in a fight with <hi>Michael,</hi> and was then revived again to the wonder of the world. Again, there are but seven Kings in the Thirteenth Chapter; how come there to be eight in the Seventeenth? Thirdly, The eight Kings in the Seventeenth Chapter are all Idolatrous according to him, but the Inscription of Idolatry is onely upon seven Heads in the Thirteenth, which implies the Beast had no more then so. Of which things there can be no sense, unless according to such an Explication as I have already exhibited.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, If the Beast in the Seventeenth Chapter be the <hi>Roman</hi> Pagan Idolatry, how comes it to continue but fourty two months in <hi>Grotius</hi> his sense? for that is the continuance of the <hi>Seven-headed Beast</hi> in the Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth. Himself also acknowledges the Ten Horns of one Beast not to be the same with the Ten Horns of the other. I omit to note that <hi>Domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio Romana,</hi> which he says is the <hi>Babylonish Whore</hi> in the Seventeenth Chapter, is not the same with <hi>Magia</hi> in the other Chapter; whenas not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding I think it clear enough that the <hi>Whore of Babylon</hi> and the <hi>Two-horned Beast</hi> are the Types of one and the same thing. But this I confess may well seem too Magisterial to make my own Exposition, though never so true, a Rule for others. Wherefore I shall wholly release <hi>Grotius</hi> from any such unequal terms, and examine his Interpretations of these two Chapters of the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> upon free and common Principles, such as all men do appeal to.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. And that, first, in a more general way, searching into the solidity of two main Grounds which he supposes: The one, <hi>That S.</hi> John <hi>begins the reckoning of the seven Heads of the Beast from</hi> Claudius; the other, <hi>That this Vision of the Whore of</hi> Babylon <hi>and the Beast</hi> that was, and is not, <hi>was wrote by S.</hi> John <hi>in</hi> Vespasian<hi>'s time.</hi> Which Grounds are so necessary for his Interpretation, that without them it is not onely incongruous, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible; forasmuch as <hi>Five</hi> are said to be <hi>fallen,</hi> and <hi>one to be,</hi> &amp;c. which therefore this Interpretation necessarily requires and implies to be <hi>Vespasian,</hi> and that he then was when this Vision was either seen or wrote. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Reasons for these Grounds deserve a more diligent Examination.</p>
                        <p>For the first of which he alledges these two. First, That <hi>Claudius</hi> was the first persecuting Emperour, I mean that persecuted the Christians. Which yet is contrary to the whole stream of Antiquity, who fix the first Persecution upon <hi>Nero,</hi> omitting that expulsion of the <hi>Jews</hi> from <hi>Rome</hi> as a thing either inconsiderable, or as not properly appertaining to
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:42932:189"/>
the Christians as such, but as they were Jews. But so far as I see, <hi>Caius,</hi> the Predecessor of <hi>Claudius,</hi> afflicted both Jew and Christian more by his enormous Extravagancies then ever <hi>Claudius</hi> did, concerning which <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> himself has wrote in his Notes upon 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. <hi>Moeror metúsque maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus &amp; Judaeorum &amp; Christianorum plenum habuit effectum.</hi> So that the <hi>Epoche</hi> might have begun at <hi>Caligula</hi> as well as <hi>Claudius</hi> according to this rate, which shews the Exposition to be but arbitrarious. Besides, if the <hi>Epoche</hi> begin at <hi>Claudius</hi> because a Persecutor, why did not the account break off where Persecution ceased? For <hi>Galba, Otho, Vitellius, Titus</hi> and <hi>Vespasian</hi> are none of them infamous for any persecution.</p>
                        <p>The other reason why this <hi>Epoche</hi> is fix'd on <hi>Claudius</hi> is, because S. <hi>John</hi> himself was banished into <hi>Patmos</hi> in <hi>Claudius</hi> his time, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore S. <hi>John</hi> accounts from the time of his Banishment, as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> from the <hi>Epoche</hi> of his Captivity. But this is a very weak Allegation. For <hi>Ezekiel</hi> did not compute the time from his particular Captivity, but from the Captivity of <hi>Jeconiah,</hi> as you may see again and again in <hi>Gaspar Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> upon <hi>Ezekiel.</hi> Besides that it is one thing for a man to compute what happened to himself, as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> did, from the time of his private Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and another to reckon the succession of Kings or Emperours from so private an <hi>Epoche.</hi> And then, which is still worse, it is not at all probable that S. <hi>John</hi> was banished into <hi>Patmos</hi> in the reign of <hi>Claudius:</hi> not onely because he suffered not as a <hi>Jew,</hi> but as he was a witness of <hi>Jesus;</hi> but also because he has not set down that <hi>Epoche,</hi> which had been very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, and but ill omitted, if there were any such great stress lay upon it, as to assure us of the truth of the main Visions of the <hi>Apocalyps.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Adde to this, that S. <hi>John</hi> was not at <hi>Rome,</hi> and therefore unconcerned in this Edict of <hi>Claudius;</hi> and if he had been there, or where-ever else he was, there is no mention made of any confinement to places in these Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsions. And we see that <hi>Act.</hi> 18. <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priscilla,</hi> that were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled from <hi>Rome,</hi> abode securely enough in <hi>Corinth,</hi> to whom S. <hi>Paul</hi> joyned himself, and wrought on his Trade with them. And, lastly, it is against the whole current of Antiquity, <hi>Irenaeus, Origen, Tertullian, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius, Hieronymus, Nicephorus, Victorinus, Primasius, Andreas</hi> and <hi>Aretas,</hi> and against the universal suffrage of both Papists and Protestants, who with one voice declare that S. <hi>John</hi>'s Exile into <hi>Patmos</hi> was under <hi>Domitian.</hi> But I need not insist on these things so much for the present, sith the confutation of his second Ground will make this vanish also.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Which second Ground is, <hi>That the Vision of the Whore and the Beast was wrote by S.</hi> John <hi>in</hi> Vespasian<hi>'s time.</hi> But unless it was seen then, it will not serve the turn; forasmuch as it is not the voice of S. <hi>John,</hi> but of the Angel, that says, <hi>Five are fallen, and one is,</hi> and therefore the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, as well as the writing thereof, must be in <hi>Vespasian</hi>'s time: And also in the Island <hi>Patmos,</hi> because once and for all at the beginning of this Book of Visions he saith, they happened to him in the Isle of <hi>Patmos,</hi> and never gives any other intimation throughout the whole Book: whence it is incredible but that they all befell him in that Retirement. Which things I note to meet with <hi>Grotius</hi> his supposition in his <hi>De Antichristo,</hi> That though S. <hi>John</hi> was banished into <hi>Patmos</hi> under <hi>Claudius,</hi> yet he was out
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:42932:189"/>
of the Island in <hi>Vespasian</hi>'s time. From whence I would infer, that the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Whore and the Beast was not seen by <hi>John</hi> in <hi>Vespasian</hi>'s time. Which is the utter destruction of <hi>Grotius</hi> his Exposition, as I noted before.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. And this alone of his own concession were enough to put an end to this Debate: but it being a matter of such great consequence, I shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist a little larger upon it, and no less then demonstrate the utter insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency and weakness of this Ground of <hi>Grotius.</hi> Wherefore sticking close to the Catholick suffrage of Antiquity and of all Writers as well Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants as Papists, let us again consider what reason <hi>Grotius</hi> has to exile S. <hi>John</hi> into <hi>Patmos</hi> in <hi>Claudius</hi> his time: for <hi>Claudius</hi> his expelling the Jews from <hi>Rome</hi> falls short of banishing <hi>John</hi> into <hi>Patmos</hi> by many degrees.</p>
                        <p>For, first, <hi>Grotius</hi> was to prove that by <hi>Jews</hi> are meant <hi>Christians</hi> in that place. For there are no contemptible reasons to induce one to believe that the <hi>Jews,</hi> not the <hi>Christians,</hi> are meant there. First, Because the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> sought a Kingdom above, not on the Earth: but the <hi>Jews</hi> ran mad after such a Christ or <hi>Messias</hi> as would make them Masters of the World; and therefore they onely could seem dangerous in <hi>Rome,</hi> as whose Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults tended to an Earthly Booty. Secondly, In the <hi>Acts</hi> this Edict of <hi>Claudius</hi> is mentioned as touching the <hi>Jews</hi> onely, and <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scilla,</hi> as being <hi>Jews,</hi> (for there is not the least intimation of their being <hi>Christians)</hi> are said to depart from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Corinth.</hi> Thirdly, The fresh remembrance of <hi>Tiberius</hi> his Edict against the Accusers of Christians might have still that influence upon the mind of his Successors, that so sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly no such harsh Sentence should pass against them; especially they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a people, as I said, whose thoughts were on Heaven, did not lie at catch for things on Earth. And, lastly, None of the Ancients ever taxed <hi>Claudius</hi> for any injury done to the Christians; whenas if they had been banished, and S. <hi>John</hi> himself confined to <hi>Patmos,</hi> (which had been a very severe punishment, and to flesh and bloud little less tolerable then death) undoubtedly the Infamie of so great a Cruelty would have been trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Posterity by the Church, and <hi>Claudius</hi> not escaped the brand of a Persecutor.</p>
                        <p>Nor do those words of <hi>Suetonius</hi> prove the Edict to belong to the Christians, <hi>Claudius Judaeos impulsore Chresto tumultuantes Româ ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulit;</hi> but onely that there was an Edict against the <hi>Jews.</hi> For who can believe any weight in his asserting that they tumultuated <hi>impulsore Chre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sto,</hi> whenas Christ was not then alive on Earth, much less at <hi>Rome,</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense the <hi>Jews</hi> into Tumults? unless it was that the <hi>Jews</hi> were occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally vext at the Christians in <hi>Rome,</hi> and made a great deal a-doe at their acknowledging such a <hi>Messias</hi> as was crucifi'd, and therefore of whom there was no hope of serving their turn for the regaining of their liberty and making them great men in this world. Wherefore there being such a stir with the <hi>Jews</hi> concerning their <hi>Chrestus</hi> or <hi>Messias</hi> against the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> uncertain Fame might make <hi>Suetonius</hi> phrase it so as he has: but this Inspection into the <hi>Genius</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> might cause <hi>Claudius</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel them out of the City, it may be, in favour of the <hi>Christians,</hi> as well

as for his own security. This passage in <hi>Suetonius</hi> is so far from determining this Edict to the <hi>Christians,</hi> that <hi>Orosius</hi> gives this judgment of it: <hi>Utrùm</hi>

But suppose that Decree reached the Christians also at <hi>Rome;</hi> it is but an arbitrarious surmise to think it reached to other parts of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire: and if to other parts of the Empire, it is not a Confinement, as I have above hinted, but a Banishment at large from some one certain place; and then onely of such, it is most likely, as were in Tumults, or at least from such Towns where they might have caused Tumults; which was most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely in the place where S. <hi>John</hi> resided, the sweetness and peaceableness of whose spirit would tempt any discreet Governour to retain him, for the better keeping things in peace. And yet so extravagant is this supposition, that he is the <hi>onely</hi> man that is thus sharply dealt with, nor can they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an example of any one else thus banished in <hi>Claudius</hi> his time; and yet all the Apostles certainly were busie enough in doing their duties to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate Christianity in the Empire.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. I but you will say, this Record of <hi>Claudius</hi> his expelling the <hi>Jews</hi> from <hi>Rome,</hi> being seconded with the Testimony of <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms him banished into <hi>Patmos</hi> under the same Emperour, is such a double cord as will not easily be broken: Which I would the easilier grant, if they had any strength at all single; as I have shew'd the first has none, and shall doe the like for the second.</p>
                        <p>There are two places alledged out of <hi>Epiphanius:</hi> The one <hi>Haeres.</hi> 51. <hi>Sect.</hi> 33. where speaking of S. <hi>John,</hi> he writes thus; <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, &amp;c. But these words are not spoken definitively of S. <hi>John</hi>'s being in <hi>Patmos</hi> in <hi>Claudius Caesar</hi>'s reign, but onely that he was in <hi>Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos</hi> and did prophesie there: but for the time he says it was at the farthest in <hi>Claudius</hi> his reign; for that is the meaning of <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, that it was the soonest that he could be thought to prophesie in <hi>Patmos,</hi> as an <hi>Exul</hi> there; but he does not say absolutely he prophesied then. So that it is a more lax and conjectural Affirmation concerning the time, and onely says that it is the utmost distance within which he may be thought to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesied; not denying but that the time of his Prophesying might be later, suppose in <hi>Domitian</hi>'s time. Of which <hi>Petavius</hi> is so confident, that he writes over against <hi>Imperante Claudio</hi> in the Text, this short Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Note, <hi>Mendosè, pro Domitiano;</hi> he taking it for granted that <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi> speaks more definitively then I think he does. And I believe both <hi>Grotius,</hi> and others that cite the place to the same purpose with him, were aware of such a sense of <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap> as I have hinted, which made them leave it out of their Citation, as weakening the force thereof.</p>
                        <p>Nor is it any Argument that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> does dogmatically define that S. <hi>John</hi> prophesied in <hi>Claudius</hi> his time, because if he was not perswaded of that opinion, he would have followed the ordinary one, as being fitter to use against the <hi>Montanists,</hi> that would derogate from the truth of the

For he seems to be in love with the Objection thus circumstantiated, he gaining so much (as he conceives) upon the Objectors as by their own Supposition to make them acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge S. <hi>John,</hi> or the Author of this Book of Visions, to be really endued with the Spirit of Prophecie. <gap reason="foreign">

                           <hi>For if they say there was not a Church at</hi> Thyatira <hi>in being at that instant when S.</hi> John <hi>wrote, they plainly declare that S.</hi> John <hi>did prophesie and intimated afore-hand that there would be one.</hi> Wherefore <hi>Epiphanius</hi> found little reason why he should, from the state of the present Controversie, chuse the ordinary opinion rather then that which is accounted his own.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. The other place of <hi>Epiphanius</hi> is <hi>Haeres.</hi> 51. <hi>Sect.</hi> 12. where he tells us how S. <hi>John</hi> was impelled and constrained to write the Gospel by the instigation of the Holy Ghost; though he very much declined it <gap reason="foreign">

                           <hi>when he was more then ninety years old, after his return out of</hi> Patmos, <hi>which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in</hi> Claudius <hi>his time.</hi> Where there is this adjection of the mention of his return from <hi>Patmos</hi> as a confirmation of the grandevity of the Apostle at that time.</p>
                        <p>Now let us see what service this <hi>Magnus testis &amp; Historiarum diligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tissimus Inquisitor</hi> (as <hi>Grotius</hi> calls him, as well as he does <hi>Petavius</hi> who so plainly contradicts him in this very point) can doe this learned Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the present case. For this passage, if there had been any force in the former, does quite obtund it, it shewing <hi>Epiphanius</hi> not at all diligent in Chronologie, (as <hi>Alcazar</hi> has also well observed) in making S. <hi>John</hi> above ninety years old in <hi>Claudius</hi> his time, whenas the common Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church is, that he was very young when he entred upon his Apostleship. S. <hi>Jerom</hi> saith that Christ chose him when he was but a youth or child. <hi>Baronius</hi> makes him just twenty five years old at the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of our Saviour. The Scripture it self implies also that he was but young, in that Christ says to his Mother concerning <hi>John, Woman, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold thy son;</hi> which should imply that he was at least as young as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Christ, he being himself born of the Virgin when she was but of the age of fifteen, as <hi>Nicephorus</hi> relates out of an Epistle of <hi>Euodius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Antioch.</hi> But by <hi>Epiphanius</hi> his Chronologie S. <hi>John</hi> would be at least twenty years older then the Blessed Virgin, concerning whom not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding Christ says to <hi>John, Behold thy Mother.</hi> And which is still worse, if S. <hi>John</hi> was ninety years old when he came out of <hi>Patmos</hi> under the reign of <hi>Claudius,</hi> it will run the Nativity of Christ near fourty years

back, and place it long before <hi>Cyrenius</hi> was Governour of <hi>Syria;</hi> foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as all men conceive S. <hi>John</hi> to be at least as young as our Saviour, if not much younger.</p>
                        <p>Which Absurdities detect <hi>Epiphanius</hi> not to be so great and unexcepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable a Witness in History as <hi>Grotius</hi> would make him. And therefore <hi>Petavius</hi> again peremptorily sets down in the Margin over against <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi> his <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>Sub Cocceio Nerva Joannes revocatur ab exilio:</hi> Which certainly is the truth, and agrees with that time of S. <hi>John</hi>'s age which <hi>Epiphanius</hi> allots to him, when he wrote the Gospel. For supposing him to be born about the same time our Saviour was, or a little later, this writing of the Gospel will fall into the years of <hi>Nerva,</hi> or at least some few years after <hi>Domitian,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as you shall finde it set down in Chronologies.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. But supposing <hi>Epiphanius</hi> his Testimony of value in this case, the same <hi>Epiphanius</hi> that witnesses <hi>John</hi> in <hi>Patmos</hi> under the reign of <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi> witnesses him out again in the same reign; which, as I have <note n="*" place="margin">Sect. 4.</note> already noted, spoils <hi>Grotius</hi> his Project, who would have S. <hi>John</hi> prophesy in <hi>Vespasian</hi>'s time, else all the fat is in the fire as touching the Interpretation of the Seventeenth Chapter of the <hi>Apocalyps.</hi> But I think I have plainly proved that there can be nothing gained out of <hi>Epiphanius</hi> for establishing <hi>Grotius</hi> his conceit, these Passages of the Father being either but Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures or Inadvertencies, or else some lapses of the Scribe, who wrote, it seems, more glibly the name of <hi>Claudius</hi> then of the other two Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours; as it might appear in that second Citation, S. <hi>John</hi> being indeed about that age when he came out of <hi>Patmos</hi> in <hi>Cocceius Nerva</hi> his time, but not in <hi>Claudius</hi>'s.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. So that <hi>Grotius</hi> has not so much as one Witness to countenance his new Invention; and if he had had this one, what is one to the whole stream of Antiquity and of the Churches? Nay, what is <hi>Epiphanius</hi> his Testimony compared with the Testimony of that one single Father <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus,</hi> he living two hundred years nearer S. <hi>John</hi>'s time then <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> and who expresly asserts, in <hi>Eusebius,</hi> that the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> was impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to S. <hi>John</hi> at the end of <hi>Domitian</hi>'s reign? For speaking of the Name of the Beast, he writes thus; <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>If the name of the Beast had been openly to be divulged at this time, it would have been told by him that saw those Visions which under one col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective Title are called</hi> The Apocalyps: <hi>For they were seen not long since at the end of</hi> Domitian<hi>'s reign.</hi>

                        <p n="11">11. This I doubt not but is the genuine sense of these words, and that he speaks not of the Vision of the Beast alone under that name of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calyps,</hi> but of the whole body of Visions so called: Otherwise for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctness sake he would have said, not <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, especially considering <hi>Apocalypsis</hi> had then passed into a known Title of this volume of Visions. Besides that the <hi>Name of the Beast</hi> was not seen by S. <hi>John,</hi> but the <hi>Number of his Name:</hi> And therefore whereas the Latine has it, <hi>Antichristi nomen per</hi>

                           <hi>ipsum utique editum fuisset qui Apocalypsin videret, neque enim ante multum temporis visum est;</hi> I should easily believe that <hi>visum</hi> got in for <hi>visa,</hi> by the oscitancy of the Scribe. For unless the Interpreter of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> had understood <hi>[qui Apocalypsin videret]</hi> of the whole Collection of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and not of the Beast onely and his Name, he would have rather said <hi>Revelationem,</hi> and for sureness have added <hi>ejus,</hi> to make the sense more distinct and determinate; <hi>qui Revelationem ejus videret.</hi> And lastly, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose this Testimony proved onely that the Vision of the Thirteenth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the <hi>Revelation</hi> was seen at the end of <hi>Domitian</hi>'s reign, (which I have not the least conceit of) it will not serve <hi>Grotius</hi> his turn, since this of the Seventeenth Chapter is later, both by order of situation in the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calyps,</hi> and also by nature. For it being the plainest Vision concerning the Beast with seven Heads and ten Horns that was exhibited to S. <hi>John,</hi> and containing in it a <hi>Key</hi> for the right understanding the other, it ought to come last, the Comment being naturally later then the Text, according to common sense and reason.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. Wherefore seeing there is no proof at all that <hi>Claudius</hi> persecuted the Christians, much less that he exiled <hi>John</hi> into <hi>Patmos,</hi> but that <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitian</hi> was a notorious Persecuter, and universal Antiquity attesting that S. <hi>John</hi> was banished into <hi>Patmos</hi> under him, and that there he received the <hi>Apocalyps;</hi> there is nothing to give a stop to the Conclusion, but that we may inferre that the whole Volume of those Visions was there wrote by him towards the latter end of <hi>Domitian</hi>'s reign, as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> has affirmed, (the Second Persecution beginning not till the tenth year of <hi>Domitian)</hi> I mean the latter end of his real and uncontrovertible reign, when he suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded his Brother <hi>Titus,</hi> not that imaginary one in his Father's absence, for he was not then truly Emperour. And though we should admit he had two reigns; if the end of his reign be mentioned at large, as it is here in <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> it must either signifie the end of all that time he reigned, or the end of his more notorious and confessed reign, which is here all one, and therefore most certainly understood. So that there is no avoiding the Authority of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> by this sleight. Not to adde that there is no Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution taken notice of in all <hi>Vespasian</hi>'s reign, and therefore no <hi>Patmos</hi> for S. <hi>John,</hi> and consequently no Prophecy, as I have noted above. So that there is not the least shadow of probability that the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> was wrote at any other time then in what <hi>Irenaeus</hi> has declared it to be.</p>

The <hi>Apocalyps</hi> it self also witnesses against this dream of S. <hi>John</hi>'s being in <hi>Patmos</hi> under <hi>Claudius</hi> his reign, in that general Preface to all the Visions, <hi>I John, who am also your brother and companion in tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in the Kingdom and Patience of Jesus Christ,</hi> &amp;c.

                        <p>But there is yet another more apposite place for our purpose, I mean, the Martyrdome of <hi>Antipas</hi> Bishop of the Church of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> who suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered under <hi>Domitian</hi> about the tenth year of his reign. That which I note as most remarkable in his story is, That he was solicited by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the place to renounce Christianity, because it was but a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty, urging upon him <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="350" facs="tcp:42932:193"/>
which the Papists use to seduce our modern <hi>Antipae</hi> or Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>papists. But that which I drive at is this; That the mention of <hi>Antipas</hi> his Martyrdome as past in the very beginning of this Book of Visions does plainly detect that they were all seen after the beginning of the second Persecution, which was under <hi>Domitian,</hi> and above twenty years after the destruction of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> by <hi>Titus.</hi> For that the Record of <hi>Antipas</hi> his Martyrdome is true, there can be no doubt, his mention in the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> engaging the Church to take more then ordinary notice of that Martyr. Nor can any After-figments concerning his suffering, I mean the manner of it, make the faith of the Church at all suspected concerning the time. So solid assurance is there every way that this Volume of <hi>Apocalyptick</hi> Visions was delivered to <hi>John</hi> in <hi>Patmos</hi> at the latter end of <hi>Domitian</hi>'s reign, and so convincing evidence on every side, that he must be Sceptical even to dotage that after due consideration can at all doubt of it.</p>
                        <p n="14">14. The eviction of which truth I have thus copiously and industriously wrought out, because it does not onely lay flat to the ground all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations of <hi>Grotius</hi> in these <hi>Thirteenth</hi> and <hi>Seventeenth</hi> Chapters, but also all his Expositions of the <hi>Seven Seals</hi> and <hi>Seven Trumpets,</hi> and consequently of the whole Book of the <hi>Apocalyps.</hi> For he interprets the <hi>Seals</hi> and <hi>Trumpets</hi> of things that happened many years before this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy: which makes the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> as good sense as if it were a Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling of things that were past; whenas the Preface to the whole Book runs expresly thus, <hi>The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his servants</hi>

1. WHerefore the Foundation of <hi>Grotius</hi> his Expositions being so false and flitting; and such as cannot but shrink if it be hard pressed upon, the structure cannot be sound, nor well shapen, but forced, distor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and difform. For if Prophecy will fit as well those times they aim not at as those they do, they will be clouded with such invincible ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity, that they will lose both their usefulness and authentickness.</p>
                        <p>We shall shew therefore that <hi>Grotius,</hi> as he has gone upon a false Ground, so his Expositions of these <hi>Seventeenth</hi> and <hi>Thirteenth</hi> Chapters are answerably harsh and unapplicable, and that he has left the plain road, and rush'd through hedge and ditch, and pulled up all fences, to gather a Nosegay of Flowers that both smell ill, and immediately wither in his hand in the very gathering of them.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Supposing then that the Visions of the <hi>Seventeenth</hi> and <hi>Thirteenth</hi> Chapters were imparted to S. <hi>John</hi> in <hi>Vespasian</hi>'s time, (which yet to me is undoubtedly false) let us take this brief view of the Harshnesses and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruities of his Interpretation.</p>
                        <p>As first, Whereas he makes the <hi>Seven Heads</hi> of the Beast to be <hi>Seven Emperours,</hi> five whereof were gone in <hi>Vespasian</hi>'s time, namely <hi>Claudius, Nero, Galba, Otho, Vitellius;</hi> I have shewn already that there is no reason at all for his beginning his compute at <hi>Claudius, John</hi> neither being bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in his reign, nor he being so ill an Emperour as his Predecessour <hi>Caius Caligula,</hi> and the Church reckoning not their Persecutions before <hi>Nero,</hi> nor any complaint made of <hi>Nero</hi>'s successours till <hi>Domitian,</hi> that these should be such <hi>Heads of Blasphemy</hi> above the rest of the Emperours. Whence it is a very groundless and fictitious thing to make but <hi>five Heads</hi> to have preceded <hi>Vespasian,</hi> whenas he was the tenth from <hi>Julius Caesar;</hi> and then to take in but two of his successours, <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Domitian,</hi> whenas at least thirty succeeded him, in whose time were eight of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions of the Christians.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. For which curt reckoning <hi>Grotius</hi> has no excuse but that it falls so luckily to <hi>Domitian</hi>'s share to be the <hi>Beast that was, and is not, and yet is;</hi> forasmuch as he <hi>had been</hi> Emperour in his Father's absence, <hi>was not</hi> when this Vision was given, and <hi>yet was,</hi> to wit, in being, and should <hi>ascend out of the bottomless pit again,</hi> that is, be Emperour again, after his Father and Brother <hi>Titus</hi> his decease. This is the matter in which <hi>Grotius</hi> so much applauds himself, to the great reproach of the ancient Fathers, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so exceeding much more near to the time of <hi>Domitian</hi> then <hi>Grotius,</hi> could not for all that discern the fulfilling of this Prophecy in him: which therefore was, it should seem, ever useless to the Church, being no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition to them of any thing.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. But to profess my own judgement freely concerning this Conceit, it seems to me to make the <hi>Spirit of Prophecy</hi> to affect the foretelling of pretty things rather then useful and weighty. But as I have already demonstrated out of Chronology that this supposition of the time of the Vision is false, (whereby the peculiar support and recommendableness of the interpretation is quite taken away) so are there also several Inconcinnities in it, and even Historical Defects, and nothing but what is hard and suspicable.</p>

                           <pb n="352" facs="tcp:42932:195"/>
For, in the first place, I will deny that <hi>Domitian</hi> was ever really and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Emperour in his Father's time, but that he was onely a pragmatical and active young man, and did, as his Father <hi>Vespasian</hi> complains, <hi>terminos aetatis &amp; concessa filio egredi,</hi> that he went something beyond his tether; which he might doe without being Emperour, as also be saluted by that Title in Courtship by Flatterers. But a civil salutation is no Instalment into the Imperial Power; otherwise <hi>Titus</hi> had been also Emperour in his Father's time, whom the Souldiery, at his taking <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> did with an universal gratulatory Acclamation salute Emperour. Nay he wore a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem also at <hi>Memphis</hi> at the Consecration of the <hi>Aegyptian Apis,</hi> and great rumours and suspicions there were that he had seized on the Eastern part of the Empire against his Father. It were too voluminous a business to enter into History; but I doubt not but, laying all passages together, <hi>Titus</hi> will be found as much Emperour in his Father's time as <hi>Domitian,</hi> and rather much more, and therefore a fitter person to be the <hi>Beast that was, and is not,</hi> then <hi>Domitian</hi> in that regard. But neither of them fit, because neither of them were truly and really Emperours before their Father's decease.</p>
                        <p>Besides this, it is quite out of the road of the Prophetick style to call a <hi>Single Person</hi> a <hi>Beast,</hi> which in that style always signifies a <hi>Body Politick.</hi> And then to say <hi>he is not,</hi> because not Emperour, is hardly true; and that elegant contradiction, <hi>[that he is not, and yet is]</hi> so expounded, that he is a Man, though he be not an Emperour, is but a flat and dilute Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition in comparison of that in the Exposition I have given thereof, in shewing that the Image of the Beast is the Beast and is not the Beast. But they could not say in <hi>Vespasian</hi>'s time, nor in <hi>Domitian</hi>'s own time, that <hi>Domitian</hi> was Emperour and yet not Emperour at once.</p>
                        <p>And, lastly, his <hi>ascending out of the bottomless pit</hi> is a Prophetick phrase, the same that to <hi>ascend out of the Sea,</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap> the <hi>multitude of Waters,</hi> which is proper to <hi>Bodies Politick,</hi> they consisting of multitudes of men, but not fit to be said of a <hi>Single Person,</hi> no more then <hi>Beast</hi> in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick style is.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Secondly, The Angel's Interpretation of the <hi>Heads of the Beast</hi> is, that they are so many <hi>Kings,</hi> of which, saith <hi>Grotius, Domitian</hi> is the Eighth; <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>He is the eighth King.</hi> Wherefore <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> is plainly and unavoidably the <hi>eighth Head,</hi> according to <hi>Grotius</hi> his Interpretation, and the fore-going Exposition of the Angel, which cannot be rejected. Whence it will follow that the Beast has <hi>eight Heads,</hi> which is point-blank against all the Visions of the Beast which exhibit him ever <hi>Seven-headed.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>Grotius</hi> notwithstanding makes <hi>Domitian</hi> the Beast himself. Which is a thing impossible, that one and the same Being should be both the whole Beast and the Head of the Beast. Besides, how hard and vexed a sense, or rather how palpable a piece of Non-sense, will that be that shall pretend to make <hi>Claudius, Nero, Galba, Otho, Vitellius, Vespasian</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> the Heads of <hi>Domitian,</hi> they being all of one equal Supremacy, I mean <hi>Domitian</hi> with those other seven foregoing <hi>Caesars,</hi> and not in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when he was the Beast, and therefore impossible to be his Seven Heads?</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="353" facs="tcp:42932:195"/>
Fourthly, How wild a conceit again is it, to clap <hi>Ten Horns</hi> on this one Man or Beast <hi>Domitian</hi> his head some Ages after his ceasing to be, as I have else-where noted <hi>Grotius</hi> to doe, who makes these <hi>Ten Horns</hi> to be the <hi>Ostrogotthi, Wisigotthi, Vandali, Gepidae,</hi> &amp;c? Certainly it were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite that <hi>Domitian</hi> were raised out of Hell again to live upon Earth, (as a late Essayer upon the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> imagines) to make this part of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie any thing at all applicable unto him. Whence the madness of <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> his Exposition is more fully detected, that cannot be made out without the help of such incredible Extravagancies.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Fifthly, <hi>The Beast that was, and is not,</hi> is the very Beast which the <hi>Whore</hi> is said <hi>to ride upon,</hi> as is plain out of the Text: <hi>The Beast which thou sawest, was, and is not;</hi> and the <hi>Whore</hi> rode upon the Beast which he saw. Did therefore the <hi>Whore</hi> (which <hi>Grotius</hi> interprets <hi>Dominatio Romana)</hi> ride onely in <hi>Domitian</hi>'s time, and go on foot in the former and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ages.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly, The Beast which <hi>John</hi> saw, <hi>Grotius</hi> first interprets the <hi>Roman</hi> Pagan Idolatry. But was this Beast so short-liv'd as to be included within the space of the reign of seven Emperours? or did this Beast live so long time without any Heads, then with seven successive Heads, and then for a long time without Heads again, that it should be called the <hi>Beast with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Heads</hi> and no more?</p>
                        <p>Seventhly, To call <hi>Idolatry</hi> in the Abstract a <hi>Beast,</hi> is quite out of the Prophetick style; and to make one and the same Beast one while <hi>Idolatry</hi> and another while <hi>Domitian,</hi> is to change Substances into Accidents and Accidents into Substances <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap>and to speak contradictiously to the express Interpretation of the Angel himself, who says, <hi>The Beast which thou sawest, was, and is not,</hi> which in <hi>Grotius</hi> his way can be none but <hi>Domitian.</hi> Nor is there any subterfuge to be sought in a second <hi>Henopoeia</hi> in this case: for that Figure is no shelter for bungles and shifts from Abstracts to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretes in the same kind, but a handsom Repository for different matters sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifiable by one Type; as is easie to be understood from what is declared concerning that Scheme.</p>
                        <p>Eighthly, If <hi>Domitian</hi> be the Beast and the <hi>Whore</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Power, then the <hi>Roman</hi> Power rides on <hi>Domitian</hi>'s back, as if <hi>Domitian</hi> were not the Head but the Body of the Empire, or, if you will, metamorphoz'd by this marvellous Interpretation into <hi>Apuleius</hi> his Ass for the <hi>Roman</hi> Power to ride on. But then again <hi>Domitian</hi> being chief of the <hi>Roman</hi> Power him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, he must by this account ride also upon himself, and make a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Centaure, such as the deepest-witted Poets never so much as dream'd of.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Ninthly, If the <hi>Whore</hi> be the <hi>Roman</hi> Pagan Power, how can she be said to be the <hi>Mother of Fornications,</hi> and out of her Cup to intoxicate the Kings of the Earth with that kind of wickedness, whenas all the Earth, before the Empire was Christian, were Idolaters of themselves, and stored <hi>Rome</hi> her self with multifarious kinds of Idolatry? Which Objection nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Grotius</hi> nor any one else, with all the fetches they have, will be ever able to assoil.</p>

O the depth of the Mystery!</p>
                        <p>In the eleventh place, Those <hi>ten Kingdomes</hi> which <hi>Grotius</hi> would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuate to be the <hi>ten Horns,</hi> were not Kingdoms <hi>intra fines Imperii Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mani,</hi> as he speaks, before the Conversion of the Empire to Christianity, nay indeed before the subversion of it, or discerption into many Kingdoms: how then could these <hi>Kings give their Power to the Beast;</hi> I mean not <note place="margin">Apocal. 17. 13.</note> onely to <hi>Domitian,</hi> who is farther removed from them, but to the <hi>Roman</hi> Pagan Idolatry, which by this time of Discerption had ceased to be the Religion of the Empire? Or how can they be said to <hi>eat the flesh of the Whore and burn her with fire,</hi> whenas the City of <hi>Rome</hi> had ceased to be <note place="margin">Vers. 16.</note> the Pagan Whore before these Kings were in being, much more before she was assaulted and sacked by <hi>Totilas,</hi> which was <hi>Anno</hi> 547. whenas Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilism was cast out and the Temples of their Idols demolished all over the Empire about the year 399. the very next to that wherein (according to the Devil's mistake upon his survey of the proportion betwixt the <hi>Inward</hi> and <hi>Outward</hi> Court of the Temple) Christianity was expected by the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens to expire?</p>
                        <p>And again in the twelfth place, How can those Ten Kings which <hi>Grotius</hi> assigns be said to <hi>fight against the Lamb</hi> in his sense, that is against Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity <note place="margin">Apoc. 17. 14.</note> in the behalf of the <hi>Roman</hi> Pagan Idolatry, whenas the Empire had then become Christian, and was not that Pagan Beast to whom they should lend their aid and power against the preaching of the Gospel? Was it a likely thing that such ten Kings that were foes to Christianity should, as <hi>Grotius</hi> speaks, <hi>intra fines Imperii Romani Romanis ipsis concedentibus regnare?</hi> So impossible is <hi>Grotius</hi> his Interpretation concerning the <hi>ten Horns</hi> every way.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. In the thirteenth place, This destruction of <hi>Babylon</hi> is a perfect <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, a full and final destruction, set out by the <hi>casting a Milstone into the midst of the Sea.</hi> But none of <hi>Grotius</hi> his <hi>Ten Kings</hi> ever destroyed <hi>Rome</hi> in such a manner.</p>
                        <p>In the fourteenth, That exhortation to the People of God <hi>to goe out of</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Apoc. 18. 4.</note> 
                           <hi>Babylon, lest they partake of her sins,</hi> can make no good sense in <hi>Totilas</hi> his time. For would the Angel have all the Christians leave the City of <hi>Rome</hi> in the year 546. and for several years upwards toward <hi>Constantine</hi>'s time, because there might be some Pagan Idolaters still amongst them, and not rather keep the City, for the better suppressing Idolatry and quite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguishing it, and not let it spread more by the receding of the hearty Christians out of it? Truly this gloss of <hi>Grotius</hi> is very ridiculous and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, that makes the Angel utter such an irrational Exhortation.</p>
                        <p>Fifteenthly, If <hi>[Come out of her, my people, lest ye partake of her sins]</hi> be, as <hi>Grotius</hi> interprets, <hi>Tu popule mi, ubi apparuerit Totilae exercitus, exite ad Basilicas Apostolorum extra Urbem,</hi> it will follow, that to have returned again into the City after <hi>Totilas</hi> was gone, had been to return into <hi>Babylon</hi> and partake of her sins again.

                           </gap> Exposition of this <hi>Seventeenth</hi> Chapter. Let us now see how successful he is in the <hi>Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth:</hi> where he taking the same liberty of applying the Prophecy to times it was never meant of, it will be a wonder if we finde not the Interpretation alike harsh and incongruous. Let us pass therefore through the whole Chapter from verse to verse. Where</p>
                        <p>In the first, he makes the <hi>Beast with seven Heads and ten Horns</hi> to be the <hi>Roman</hi> Idolatry, whose Heads are seven Hills, and whose Horns are ten Kings, namely, of <hi>Armenia, Thracia, Galatia, Pontus, Judaea, Arabia, Adiabena, Suevia, Alpes Cottiae,</hi> and <hi>Alpes Idionni.</hi> From which account notwithstanding he varies in his second Notations: And concerning which I will omit to note any thing farther, then that such <hi rend="sup">1</hi> petty Kings as some of them are, in comparison of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire especially, could not well deserve the name of the <hi>Horns</hi> thereof, and that in reference to Idolatry, <hi rend="sup">2</hi> as if they were so peculiar Defenders of it. For there is no History that mentions their goring any one so particularly and considerably in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half thereof; and <hi>Judaea</hi> is an unsutable Horn for an Idolatrous Head to wear. Besides that their <hi rend="sup">3</hi> 
                           <hi>wearing of Crowns</hi> seems too magnificent an
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:42932:197"/>
ornament for them that are acknowledged (besides the scantness of the Territories of some of them) to be Tributaries to the <hi>Roman</hi> State. So that the Invention seems something faint touching these <hi>Ten Kings,</hi> and the Prophecy useless, they tending to no notice of any thing to the Church that might at any time be useful for them.</p>
                        <p>But now concerning the Beast it self. Besides that it is <hi rend="sup">4</hi> not according to the Prophetick style to interpret a Beast to be a Vice but a Body Politick, how can the <hi rend="sup">5</hi> 
                           <hi>Roman</hi> Idolatry be represented thereby, sith it is said to <hi>ascend out of the Sea,</hi> which <hi>Grotius</hi> confesses to signifie <hi>ortum habere?</hi> But the <hi>Roman</hi> Idolatry could not be prefigured to S. <hi>John</hi> as a thing to arise here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, since it had been in the world so many Ages agoe, and did still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue. Wherefore it was not to <hi rend="sup">6</hi> begin with the fourty two moneths to come, nor was to end with them in <hi>Grotius</hi> his sense. Nor did the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of their <hi>Caesars</hi> make a new Idolatry, no more then taking other Deities into their worship. Nor did that Idolatry <hi rend="sup">7</hi> continue but fourty two moneths, as <hi>Grotius</hi> expounds <hi>moneths</hi> in this place; I say, neither the <hi>Roman</hi> Idolatry nor Cruelty continued but fourty two moneths: and therefore the Beast here described cannot be <hi>Idololatria ferino more sae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viens</hi> in that meaning <hi>Grotius</hi> would have it.</p>
                        <p>Adde to all this, That the making the <hi>Seven Heads</hi> to be the <hi>Seven Hills of Rome</hi> is a very unlikely Exposition here, both because in the foregoing Chapter these <hi>Heads</hi> are said to be <hi rend="sup">8</hi> 
                           <hi>crowned,</hi> which is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for <hi>Hills,</hi> and one of them in this Chapter to be <hi rend="sup">9</hi> 
                           <hi>wounded and healed again,</hi> which is as little proper to these dead Heaps of Earth; as also it is very harsh to <hi rend="sup">10</hi> clap on seven Heads and ten Horns in a Concrete sense upon a Beast that is an Abstract. Which is as harsh as to make the body of a Bull Redness in the Abstract, and then to set a solid Head and Horns upon him of hard bone and flesh, &amp;c. If a man will be so curious as to count, he will finde <hi>Grotius</hi> his Interpretation guilty of at least nine or ten Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses or Incongruities in this very first verse. But we proceed.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. In the second, he makes <hi>Claudius</hi> the Body of this Beast which is <hi>Panther-like,</hi> and <hi>Domitian</hi> the Mouth thereof; then which nothing can be more extravagant. For this Beast with seven Heads and ten Horns he acknowledges to be the <hi>Roman</hi> Idolatry in the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter also. Whence it will follow, <hi rend="sup">1</hi> That <hi>Claudius</hi> is both the Body of the Beast and one of the Heads; and <hi rend="sup">2</hi> 
                           <hi>Domitian</hi> both Body, Head and Mouth, as may appear from what was noted in the foregoing Chapter. And also, which is as harsh as any thing, <hi>Claudius</hi> being the Body of the Beast and <hi>Domitian</hi> the Mouth, <hi rend="sup">3</hi> the Body will be without a Mouth for as many years as there are betwixt <hi>Claudius</hi> and <hi>Domitian</hi>'s reign, which was about fourty years. The <hi rend="sup">4</hi> Dragon also <hi>giving his power to the Beast and his Throne,</hi> can be no Prophecy of the <hi>Roman</hi> Idolatrie's receiving of it, because that was done many Ages before.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. In the third, he makes the Head of the <hi>Beast wounded to death</hi> to be the <hi>Capitol,</hi> and the healing thereof the building of it up again by <hi>Vespa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian;</hi> upon whose Coin was stamped <hi>Roma resurges.</hi> 
                           <hi rend="sup">1</hi> Now, first, I say that it is an hard Metaphor to say an Edifice of wood or stone is <hi>wounded to death,</hi> and then <hi>healed.</hi> But suppose the <hi>Capitol</hi> wounded, <hi rend="sup">2</hi> the Hill was
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:42932:197"/>
not hurt, at least not wounded to death; so that unless there were seven <hi>Capitols</hi> as well as seven Hills, the Conceit will come off very hardly: but if you leave the <hi>Capitol,</hi> and take to the Hill, the Hill can no more be said to be wounded then a mans Head whose Hat is onely cut. Again, the main thing aimed at by <hi>Grotius</hi> in interpreting this <hi>wounded Head</hi> of the fall of the <hi>Capitol</hi> is not true. <hi rend="sup">3</hi> For Idolatry was not at all lessened by the fall of the <hi>Capitol,</hi> nor the fear of the <hi>Romans</hi> that the worship of Idols would fall after it, but that the Empire would be ruined by the incursion of the Northern Nations; and upon this account is that Omen inscribed upon <hi>Vespasian</hi>'s Coin, <hi>Roma resurges.</hi> And, lastly, whereas it is said that <hi>all the world wondered after the Beast</hi> upon the healing of his deadly wound; it is manifest that some <hi rend="sup">4</hi> stranger thing then the building up the <hi>Capitol</hi> must be understood thereby. For was it any wonder to strike all the world, that the <hi>Capitol</hi> should be built up again by so rich a City and the Lady of the world? Truly the great wonder had been if they had not re-built it.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. In the fourth, he interprets <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>Idololatriae in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servierunt:</hi> which is as if it were <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi rend="sup">1</hi> 
                           <hi>they worshipped Idolatry.</hi> Which is a very hard phrase.</p>
                        <p>In the fifth, here <hi>Domitian</hi> is made the Mouth of the Beast, as was said before, and by attributing the reign of the Beast to him, <hi rend="sup">2</hi> the whole Beast: and this because <hi>Domitian</hi>'s Persecution is supposed to be but three years &amp; an half; for he began to persecute, saith <hi>Grotius,</hi> in the thirteenth year of his Reign, and was slain in the sixteenth. <hi rend="sup">3</hi> But this does not prove that his Persecution was just three years and an half; and <hi>Baronius</hi> and other Chronologers place the beginning of that Persecution in the tenth year of his Reign. Besides, <hi rend="sup">4</hi> the Text does not say, <hi>He shall persecute three years and an half,</hi> but <hi>continue so long.</hi> But <hi>Domitian</hi> continued above three years and an half, for he reigned sixteen years according to <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> his own confession.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. In the sixth and seventh, he makes <hi>Domitian</hi> still the Beast, and expounds <hi>[And there was power given him over every Tribe, and People, and Language]</hi> of the power of his Example to a more impudent exercise of Idolatry. That's one shift. Another is this, That in his reign the <hi>Dacae, Catti</hi> and <hi>Sarmatae</hi> were overcome, and the <hi>Roman</hi> Idolatry propagated thereby: as if it were a worse Idolatry then that of those Barbarians. But let any one judge if such a lank and improper sense as this can fill out the meaning of the Prophecie, which speaks of a <hi rend="sup">1</hi> Political, not Moral, Power over the Nations, and of a thing as <hi rend="sup">2</hi> new. But that the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire had such a large Dominion, was true in the reigns of the fore-going Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours as well as in his.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. In the eighth, here he makes the Beast, whom all (whose names are not in the Book of Life) do worship, to be in one Exposition <hi>Domiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> and that to <hi rend="sup">1</hi> 
                           <hi>worship</hi> him is to imitate him in Idolatry and Cruelty; which is a very insipid sense, and without example in this case, and such as himself seems out of conceit with: And therefore in his after-Exposition <hi>Domitian</hi> is not the Beast, but Idolatry, as if to <hi rend="sup">2</hi> worship Idolatry were a more tolerable phrase. But there must needs be this shifting and fridging
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:42932:198"/>
when an Interpretation sits so uneasie on a Text as this does.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. In the tenth, <hi>If any one strike with the sword, he shall perish by the sword;</hi> This he applies to <hi>Domitian</hi> who was stabbed by <hi>Stephanus.</hi> But it seems to be <hi rend="sup">1</hi> most natural to conceive the menaces of <hi>leading into captivity</hi> and <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing by the sword</hi> spoke concerning the same party. And therefore <hi>Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity</hi> being not understood of <hi>Domitian,</hi> that being <hi>smitten by the sword</hi> is not understood of him; but that the Prophecie concerns a Body Politick, and not a Single Person. For the <hi rend="sup">2</hi> 
                           <hi>Patience and Faith of the Saints</hi> seems also to imply a larger exercise of these vertues then the term of three years and an half would urge them to: as also there seems to be an Intimation of being <hi rend="sup">3</hi> freed from their troubles after this Beast is vanquished; but if <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitian</hi> be he, not the smallest part of them are over by his death, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no fewer then eight grievous Persecutions behind. Not to suggest that there was a greater affliction upon the Christians in <hi>Nero</hi>'s time then in <hi>Domitian</hi>'s, whom <hi>Tertullian</hi> calls onely <hi>Portionem Neronis.</hi> And therefore the <hi>Faith and Patience of the Saints</hi> were most exercised then. Which further betrays the groundlesness and arbitrariousness of <hi>Grotius</hi> his Exposition.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. In the eleventh, here he makes the <hi>Beast with two Horns like a Lamb</hi> to be Art Magick, and the <hi>Two Horns</hi> themselves to be <hi>Abstinence from Meats,</hi> and <hi>Chastity</hi> or <hi>Abstinence from Women.</hi> Which he would have to be an imitation of Christianity, and therefore to be called the <hi>Horns of a Lamb.</hi> But in that this Beast is said <hi>to speak like a Dragon,</hi> that it is imply'd that what he utters is for the honour of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. In which Interpretation there are these flaws. 1. That the <hi>Beast</hi> is an <hi>Art,</hi> and not a <hi>Body Politick;</hi> which is against the Laws of the Prophetick style. 2. That the <hi>Horns</hi> are simulated Vertues, not Political powers seated in some men or other; which is the genuine meaning of <hi>Horns</hi> in the phrase of the Prophets, and which is to be found first before we adjoyn any other secondary sense to the Type. 3. <hi>Vowed Coelibate</hi> and <hi>Abstinence from Meats</hi> are so far from being the characteristical Vertues of Christianity, that they are disavowed by her, as being either Parts or Signs of the Great Apostasie that was to seize the Church. 4. There seems plainly inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated a strange contradiction and opposition in the Property of this Beast, That it looking so Christian-like, should speak for the Devil: but if this Beast were <hi>Magick,</hi> it were strange if it did not speak the language of the Dragon. Lastly, The times which <hi>Grotius</hi> fixes this Prophecie to, namely of <hi>Domitian</hi> and <hi>Trajan,</hi> do not agree with his conceit, these Emperours being no favourers of <hi>Magick,</hi> but the former rather a persecutor of it, and of that very <hi>Apollonius</hi> whom he conceives to be especially pointed at in this Prophecie.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. In the twelfth, he makes the <hi>Two-horned Beast's exercising all the power of the former Beast before him,</hi> to signifie, that <hi>Magick</hi> also had her Sacrifices as well as Idolatry. But truly <hi>Magick</hi> though it had Sacrifices, yet they were clancular ones, as being so horrid and execrable. And <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratus</hi> makes it his business several times to clear <hi>Apollonius</hi> from that suspicion. Which is a sign that <hi>Magick</hi> had not so open an exercise of its abhorred Sacrifices as this Text would import, if <hi>Grotius</hi> his Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:42932:198"/>
were true. <hi>Plinie</hi> calls them <hi>Sacra Prodigiosa,</hi> and tells us that this sacrificing of men was taken away by a Decree of the Senate, bestowing this <hi>Epiphonema</hi> upon the <hi>Roman</hi> State for so doing, <hi>Non satis aestimari</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Histor. Natur. lib. 30. cap. 1.</note>

Nor did <hi>Apollonius</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise any such power, who being a <hi>Pythagorean</hi> abhorred all bloudy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices whatsoever.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. In the thirteenth, he interprets the <hi>bringing down fire from Heaven</hi> of that Lightning which happened at <hi>Apollonius</hi> his birth, and of that glimpse of Light that <hi>Achilles</hi> Ghost gave at his departure after <hi>Apollonius</hi> his conference with him by night at his Sepulchre. Which is a very frigid Exposition. For why should that Lightning which happened at <hi>Apollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> his birth be imputed to him as an effect of his Magick, <hi rend="sup">1</hi> who was neither capable then of being a Magician nor any thing else? Besides that he was born before this Prophecie, as <hi>Grotius</hi> himself must needs accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his own account acknowledge and admit; and therefore upon <hi rend="sup">2</hi> that ground the Interpretation is impossible. That glimpse of Light also which <hi>Achilles</hi> Ghost gave at his parting, that it should be the <hi>causing fire to fall from Heaven,</hi> is altogether incredible; <hi rend="sup">3</hi> for this glimpse of Light was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth where the Ghost was, did not fall from the Skie; besides, it was in <hi rend="sup">4</hi> private, as the story in <hi>Philostratus</hi> will prove, not <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p n="11">11. In the fourteenth, he interprets the <hi>making of an Image to the Beast,</hi> of <hi>Apollonius</hi> his boasting that he had raised up the Ghost of <hi>Achilles</hi> in favour of Idolatry. But who ever expounded <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                           </gap> would signifie so as <hi>Umbrae</hi> in Latine, (of which notwithstanding I dare say there is no example) yet <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, which ordinarily sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies no more then <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, as any one will acknowledge that does but observe the contexture of the whole sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. Lastly, whereas this conjuring up the Ghost of <hi>Achilles</hi> was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive the Beast who had the deadly wound, as <hi>Grotius</hi> intimates, this clashes with what was acknowledged before, that this wound was healed in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edifying the <hi>Capitol.</hi> Nor can this healing be naturally understood of any more then the first-mentioned wound which the Beast received in the Battel with <hi>Michael.</hi>

That expression <hi>[Saying to them that dwell upon Earth]</hi> is too big for the private Instructions of any Disciples of <hi>Apollonius</hi> to one single Town or some few persons therein. Lastly, it is but a lank business to take notice of one single Statue for Idolatry, when there were already innumerable numbers of them in the Empire.</p>

But if the worshipping of the Image of the Beast be understood of the Universality of Images or Idols; besides that it is exceeding hard and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant to change that settled sense of this word in which it had been used thrice before, that also will want proof, that either the Statue of <hi>Apollonius</hi> or Spectre of <hi>Achilles</hi> ever gave any command that they that would not worship Images should be killed.</p>

                        <p>But against this I urge, That the Mark of the Sealed is not a visible pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture or stigmatism, and therefore it's likely that, in a Book so Symbolical as the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> is, <hi>the Mark of the Beast</hi> does not signifie so grossly and literally. 2. These Fraternities or Societies were not the procurement of <hi>Apollonius</hi> his Magick in <hi>Trajan</hi>'s time, they being in use long before. Lastly, it is not credible, nor is there any History to make it good, that no Pagan could buy nor sell, unless he had some such sacred Stigmatism upon his body. So inadequate and groundless is this part of <hi>Grotius</hi> his Interpretation.</p>
                        <p n="14">14. In the eighteenth, he makes <hi>Ulpius Trajanus</hi> to be him to whom the Number 666 belongs; but very groundlessly, nay against all reason. For it is a mere mistake in him to think that the <hi>Number</hi> is understood of the number of any mans name whatsoever, because it is expresly said
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:42932:199"/>
that it is <hi>the Name of the Beast:</hi> And <hi>Ribera</hi> takes away all occasion of any such errour, interpreting <hi>[For it is the Number of a man]</hi> according to the mind of <hi>Aretas,</hi> (or at least according to what he thought should have been his mind as well as his own) in quite another sense, <hi>Numerus enim proprius hominis est, &amp; intellectum habentis ac ratiocinantis est nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merare.</hi> 2. If it were the Number of a man, it being intended for the note of one most signally wicked and mischievous to the Church, why must it fall to <hi>Trajan</hi>'s share, when there were Emperours far worse then he, or rather when he was so very good an Emperour, and not so cruel a Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor of the Christians as several others were, but one that easily desisted being once rightly informed of things; who gained so much on the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians themselves, that they thought he got to Heaven, and amongst the Heathens made up part of that auspicious Acclamation of the Senate to their <hi>Caesars, Felicior Augusto, Melior Trajano?</hi> 3.

That also is very weak and suspicable, to find this number in his <hi>Praenomen</hi> or Fore-name, and not in his Name. 5. But far worse to fall short, or rather to misreckon, in the account; for assuredly in <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap> and several other examples. This is most certainly true, and there is no subterfuge at all to avoid it, as <hi>Maresius, Grotius</hi> his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagonist, has fully made good against him; as he has indeed every where, in a manner, worsted him, though <hi>Grotius</hi> so unseemly contemns him, trampling him down into the durt under that uncivil Nick-name of <hi>Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borita.</hi> 6. The <hi>Mark,</hi> the <hi>Name</hi> and the <hi>Number</hi> belong all to one; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the <hi>Number</hi> be <hi>Trajan</hi>'s, the <hi>Mark</hi> must be his also.

And, lastly, if <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p n="15">15. The consideration whereof has even cast me into an astonishment, that a Person of those admirable Parts and Learning, and, as I have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways

prone to think, of great ingenuity, should ever please himself in any such performance as this; and I am more puzzled to find out the cause of this strange Misadventure ofhis, then of any <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> of nature that ever sollicited my thoughts. For to think he was in good earnest in this Exposition, and sincerely delivered his judgment, his known skill and sharpness of sight in other things will not permit: Nor will that Ingenuity and Integrity I presumed always to be in him suffer me to suspect he would willingly and wittingly, in favour of a party, forge false glosses and adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the true meaning of the Oracles of God; there being, in my apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, nothing more abominable, then for a man whom God has blest with Parts and Learning and an honest Reputation amongst men, to make use of all these against him that gave them, and for the serving of an Interest to doe so great a disservice to the Kingdom of Christ, as to hide the most concerning Truths thereof, by blinding the eyes of men by the interposing of the Idolized lustre of his own Name betwixt those Truths and them.</p>
                        <p n="16">16. But I will not be too inquisitive into what I cannot fathom. That which is more useful for us to consider is this, That <hi>Grotius,</hi> a man of those excellent Parts and Learning, and so throughly read in History, and having also so great a zeal and resolution to make good sense of these Visions in the behalf of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and for that end taken to himself the liberty (even against the whole stream of Antiquity) to chop into such Times as he thought made most for his turn; yet for all this having made so pitiful and impossible a piece of work of it, though certainly in his own judgment considerably better then any thing the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had invented for her self before; it is plain partly from hence, I mean, from <hi>Grotius</hi> his own judgment, who has by this new Invention anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quated and condemned all their precedent Expositions, and partly from our observation of the multifarious Incongruities and Impossibilities of his, that there is no Interpretation extant, against the main sense of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, that is not superlatively weak and frivolous, nay incredible and impossible.</p>

As first,</p>
                        <div type="section">
                           <head>Consect. I.</head>
                           <argument>
                              <p>That the Fourty two months, by which the Continuance of the Seven-headed Beast with ten Horns, after the healing of his wounded Head, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured, are not months of Days, but 1260 Years.</p>
                           </argument>
                           <p>This does necessarily follow from our Joint-Exposition, wherein we have clearly demonstrated, That the <hi>Beast whose deadly wound was healed,</hi> and the <hi>Beast that was, and is not, and yet is,</hi> are one and the same Beast abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely and adequately, and therefore must of necessity have one and the same duration. But the Duration of the <hi>Beast that was, and is not, and yet is,</hi> cannot be 42 months literally understood: wherefore they must signify Symbolically, and be interpreted of <hi>months of years,</hi> as there are <hi>weeks of years</hi> in <hi>Daniel.</hi> Now that the duration of 42 months cannot be literally understood of the <hi>Beast that was, and is not, and yet is,</hi> is plain from hence, in that it is said of the Seventh King that he <hi>should</hi>

Which implies that both they should stay longer then he. And yet that short-lived King did continue about an hundred years at least, as may appear by History, and will be farther demonstrated in the following Consectary.

                           <p n="2">2. This is a main Truth, and a mighty Bulwark against the rampant fury of many Fanatical Sects that would reform even to utter Confusion, Deformity and Destruction, under pretence of calling any thing Idolatrous and Antichristian that does not stand with their own phancy. But this Consectary is a Protection to the greatest and most considerable Truths of Christianity; there being a Subscription, as it were, by the Finger of God to the general sense of the Church concerning such things as were then universally held or concluded in Councils, that they were neither Idolatrous nor Antichristian.</p>

3. Now the truth of the Consectary appears thus: The Seventh King, which is called <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, (and which I have proved to be the Emperours purely Christian) it is said of him that he must <note n="*" place="margin">Apoc. 17. 10.</note> 
                              <hi>continue a short space;</hi> which, unless the Prophecy speaks altogether undeterminately and defines nothing thereby, must in reason be thought to be about a third part of that space which this Expression intimates to be <hi>long.</hi> For <hi>Short</hi> and <hi>Long</hi> are not absolute terms, but relative or comparative, and are two Extremes which imply a Middle. Wherefore we cannot better settle the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate <hi>Idea</hi> of them then by supposing a Line divided into three equal parts, and to look upon the whole Line as the Subject of <hi>Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> two thirds of the Line as the Subject of <hi>Mediocrity,</hi> and one third of <hi>Shortness.</hi> From whence we may gather universally what proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (to speak accurately and Mathematically) <hi>Short</hi> and <hi>Long</hi> must bear the one to the other: That in strictness of Notion, that which is just the third part of the other, is short in comparison of it; but in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon use of speech, though it be something more or less, it will break no squares.</p>
                           <p>There must either be some such way as this to settle this Notion, or else <hi>Short</hi> and <hi>Long</hi> will signify nothing, but be words spoke at random, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it be in such cases as there is a known measure of <hi>Mediocrity;</hi> as when we say a <hi>tall</hi> man or a <hi>low</hi> man, where it is taken for granted that a <hi>middle stature</hi> is so many foot and no more. Having seriously considered the necessity of some determinate Notion of these two terms, and how natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally they fall into this proportion, I could not but consent to so plain a Conviction, though I might justly seem prejudiced against it by what I have wrote elsewhere concerning <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                                 <hi>Mystery of Godliness,</hi> Book 5. Ch. 16. Sect. 9.</note> weighed the matter.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. Admitting therefore that to be the genuine sense of these terms of <hi>Short</hi> and <hi>Long</hi> which I have propounded, and comparing the continuance of the Seventh King with the continuance of the Sixth, that is to say, of the <hi>Pagan Caesars,</hi> which from <hi>Julius</hi> to <hi>Constantine</hi> is about 360 years; it is plain that the continuance of the Seventh King, that is, of the <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Caesars,</hi> must be 120 years or thereabout: which added to <hi>Ann. Christi</hi> 312, when <hi>Constantine</hi> was converted to Christianity, make 432 years. Which I would not pronounce to be so defined as to understand a Mathematical accuracy in the proportion of <hi>Short</hi> and <hi>Long,</hi> but with some latitude, such as befits the use of common speech in such Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions; though it be necessary to have recourse to this Mathematical <hi>Idea,</hi> that we may judge whether the use of these terms be tolerable or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant. But what I leave more laxe here will be more particularly bounded in the Proportion of the <hi>Inward</hi> and <hi>Outward</hi> Court of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; which will gird in this time a little within 400 years, but so as this present way of Compute will be very flexible and obedient to it. For supposing the Short term, viz. 120, subdivided into three degrees or parts, any thing above two thirds thereof may rationally be deemed <hi>Short</hi> in the first degree of Comparison. And we are to remember that the Duration of the Beast restored is computed by <hi>Months of years,</hi> which, as I have above noted, intimates a latitude no less then any thing within thirty in the

computation of these <hi>Epocha's;</hi> the pinching of things to a year's coinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence being of no usefulness in these long Periods, nor in the nature of the things that are predicted, and therefore not affected nor intended by that Spirit that dictated these Prophecies. Which I doubt not but is a very solid and true Observation. Wherefore it is plain enough that the Churche's lapse into Antichristianism was not till about four hundred years after Christ, the reign of the Seventh King not expiring till then.</p>

                           </argument>
                           <p>This is directly contained in our Joint-Exposition; the <hi>Beast with ten Horns</hi> being there proved to be the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire thus divided. And <hi>the Whore,</hi> which is <hi>Antichrist,</hi> is said to sit upon this Beast, and the <hi>Two-horned Beast</hi> to be the Idolatrizing Clergy of the Empire under those two Imperial Patriarchates of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Constantinople;</hi> as also the <hi>Whore</hi> and the <hi>Two-horned Beast</hi> are proved to be all one.

                           <argument>
                              <p>That the Ruine of the Fourth Monarchy, and the Introducing of the Fifth, which is the Kingdome of the Saints of the most High, as <hi>Daniel</hi> calls it, does not imply warrs and spoil and the invading of the rights of any Prince or People, according to the tenour of the Prophetick style, but merely the renewing of the Empire into an Evangelical Purity in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Worship and in Christian Life.</p>
                           </argument>
                           <p n="6">6. This plainly appears out of our Joint-Exposition, where it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest that the Beast, which is the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy, is said to be slain and not to be <hi>in rerum natura,</hi> merely because the Pagan Idolatry was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled out of it, or ceased to be the Religion of the Empire; and that the Beast was revived from the dead and brought into Being again, merely by re-introducing Idolatry again into the Empire, and by Paganizing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Objects of Christianity. Which may be also farther confirmed from the sixth Seal, where Heaven and Earth seem to fall together, and the whole Political Universe to be dissolved, and yet the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire it self stood still in Being, onely there was a change from Paganism to the Christian Faith. Of which sixth Seal Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> himself notes thus: <hi>I am verò Mutationis hujusce Objectum est Imperium Romanum; at non quà politicè à Caesaribus gubernatum, sed quà Satanae principi ejúsque Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis Daemonibus religioso nomine subditum.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Wherefore it is evident that according to the Prophetick style this Fourth Idolatrous Monarchy may be destroyed by the mere extermination of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry out of it again and whatsoever is Antichristian, and that thereupon <hi>ipso facto</hi> the true Kingdome of the Saints of the most High begins, though not an hair of any mans head falls to the ground, nor any Prince or Subject be injured in any of their Rights or Possessions. This Consectary is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding plain, and as highly useful for the asswaging that furious heat in some kinde of Fanaticks that expect such a Kingdome of the Saints as the <hi>Jews</hi> did a <hi>Messias,</hi> one that would serve their temporal Advantage. But the love of the world has blinded both their judgements alike.</p>

                           <p n="7">7. This will easily appear if we consider that wonderful Harmony which is found, upon this supposition, betwixt the Thirteenth and Seventeenth Chapters; where the Beast is said <hi>to be slain,</hi> in one of them, and to <hi>cease to be,</hi> in the other; to be the <hi>revived Image of the Beast,</hi> in one, and the <hi>Beast that was, is not, and yet is,</hi> in the other. That though there be <hi>eight Kings,</hi> yet there are but <hi>seven Heads</hi> of the Beast, which nothing can salve but this Hypothesis. For while the <gap reason="foreign">

But if that Head was not purely Christian but Idolatrous, the Beast was still in Being, and had eight Heads in the computation of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel himself.

                           </argument>
                           <p n="8">8. The truth of this Consectary appears from several Conclusions in our Joint-Exposition. 1. That the <hi>Whore of Babylon</hi> rides upon the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire, and guides and governs it in matters of Religion; which is not true of the <hi>Turk</hi> at <hi>Constantinople.</hi> 2. The Whore sits upon that Seven-hill'd City that was, as it were, the Lady of the World in Saint <hi>John</hi>'s time, (that is given as the surest character of her Seat,) which we know <hi>Constantinople</hi> then was not. 3.

The <hi>Whore</hi> or <hi>Antichrist</hi> that sits on the Seven Hills was many hundred years, as appears by the fourth Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctary, before the <hi>Turk</hi> was Master of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> which happened not passing two hundred years ago; so that Antichrist it should seem sat a thousand years besides the cushion. 6. Upon the fore-head of the <hi>Whore</hi> of <hi>Babylon</hi> is written <hi>Mystery;</hi> but the <hi>Turk</hi> is an open and professed Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of Christians. 7.

Again, in a more abstract way, That <hi>the restored Beast, the Woman in the Wilderness, the Outward Court, the Two Witnesses</hi> are of equal time. 4.

                        </argument>
                        <p n="1">1. THat the Beast with seven Heads in the Thirteenth Chapter is Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chronal with the Beast that carries the Whore in the Seventeenth, is plain, in that they are the very self-same Beast in every Respect, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears out of my Joint-Exposition. That the <hi>Whore of Babylon</hi> also and the <hi>Two-horned Beast</hi> are the self-same Thing, is made evident in the same Exposition; and therefore they must be Synchronal, unless one and the same thing can begin to be after it has continued in Being, and continue after it ceases to be. That the <hi>Whore</hi> or the <hi>Two-horned Beast</hi> is Synchro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal to the <hi>Seven-headed with ten Horns</hi> in these two Chapters, is evident, in that the <hi>Two-horned Beast</hi> is the Reviver and Healer of this <hi>Seven-headed</hi> Beast, or Restorer of him into Being; that is, An Idolatrous Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy makes again an Idolatrous Empire; one of them cannot be without another, nor continue longer one then another, from the very nature of the things themselves. So that it is manifest that the perpetual connex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of the nature of the things signified by those Visions assures them to us to be Synchronal, to begin, continue, and end together. And thus by the plain and palpably-demonstrable sense of the Visions of the Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth and Seventeenth Chapters do we gather infallibly, That the <hi>Two-horned Beast, the Whore of Babylon, the Beast that was, and is not, and yet is,</hi> or the Beast Healed or Revived, which is said to have seven Heads and ten crowned Horns, are Synchronal one to another.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. But there are four Visions more, Synchronal to these three, which may after the same manner be demonstrated to be so; I mean from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and necessary connexion betwixt the things themselves prefigured, or by their perfect Identity under several Schemes and Types, the things that they naturally signifie being already contained in the three first Synchronalls, or else by way of <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> or continued Opposition to them. As, by way of Identity, the <hi>False-Prophet,</hi> that is, the whole Body of false Prophets, must needs be Synchronal to the <hi>Two-horned Beast</hi> or the <hi>Whore,</hi> they being but the same things under several Types or Terms. By way of <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> or opposite Correspondency; as <hi>the Mournful Witnesses,</hi> and <hi>the Virgin-Company.</hi> For supposing the
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:42932:205"/>
true Church never failed to be, (as all are agreed upon) there must needs run along with the times of the Whore or Two-horned Beast the <hi>Virgin-Company</hi> and <hi>these Mournful Witnesses</hi> in correspondent Opposition to them, and the latter by a causal Connexion with them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may be an example of the first way mentioned, though not instanced in before.</p>
                        <p>The Subject also of those two mixt Visions is necessarily implied in the same time with the three first Synchronals, upon this granted <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> That the true Church never fails. For then <hi>the Woman in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> what is it but this <hi>pure Virgin-Church</hi> hid in the Paganizing Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, which is the Image of the Beast? and what the <hi>Exteriour Court of the Temple troden down by the Gentiles,</hi> but the Christian Empire dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to Christ and the true worship of God, over-run again with a new kinde of Gentilism or Idolatrous worship, which so overflows, that the true and <hi>Virgin-Church</hi> is hid in a manner in this deluge of Idolaters, at least troden down and debased and made the Abjects o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap> Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome? Wherefore, I say, from the very nature of the things themselves and close connexion they have one with another there is a very palpable Evidence that <hi>the Whore, the Two-horned Beast, the restored Beast with seven Heads and ten Horns, the False-Prophet, the Virgin-Company, the Woman in the Wilderness, the two Witnesses, the Exteriour Court of the Temple troden down by the Gentiles,</hi> are all Synchronal one to another.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. But we will not altogether omit that more abstract way Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> has gone to prove these Synchronals. First, then, it is plain that the <hi>Woman in the Wilderness, the Ten-horned Beast restored, the Exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Court troden down by the Gentiles, the Mourning of the two Witnesses</hi> are all of equal time. For the Woman's stay in the Wilderness is noted by <hi>a time, and times, and half a time,</hi> as also by 1260 daies; both which expressions signifie <hi>Three years and an half</hi> literally. The <hi>Ten-horned Beast restored,</hi> his continuance is set down by 42 months, as also the <hi>Conculcation of the Outward Court;</hi> and the daies of the <hi>Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Witnesses</hi> are 1260. All which terms of time are equal to those of the <hi>Woman in the Wilderness,</hi> and are literally <hi>Three years and an half.</hi> Of all which if any one signifie Symbolically, I think there is no body that can be so Sceptical or perverse as to deny that the other doe so too. Now that these four are not onely Equal, but Synchronal, will appear briefly thus.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The <hi>Woman in the Wilderness</hi> and the <hi>Ten-horned Beast restored</hi> begin together. For while the <hi>Woman</hi> hastens into the Wilderness, the <hi>Dragon casts a floud out of his mouth to carry her away,</hi> if he could, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Apocal. 12. 15.</note> she came thither: But he missing his aim, and driven on with Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, betakes himself to another course immediately, restoring the <hi>Ten-horned Beast,</hi> and endowing him with his forces, his Throne and his <note place="margin">Apocal. 13. 2, 3.</note> mighty Power. Wherefore the <hi>Woman</hi> could no sooner get into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, but the <hi>Dragon</hi> had furnished out an Enemy against her. But it is evident that equal Times beginning at one and the same <hi>Epocha,</hi> are Synchronal.</p>
                        <p n="5">
                           <pb n="372" facs="tcp:42932:206"/>
5. The <hi>Ten-horned Beast restored</hi> and the <hi>Mourning of the two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses</hi> end together. For at the end of the sixth Trumpet the Witnesses <note place="margin">Apoc. 11. 12, 14, 15.</note> ascend into Heaven, and at the beginning of the seventh, which is conter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous to the end of the sixth, this Acclamation is from Heaven, <hi>All the Kingdomes of the World are become the Kingdoms of the Lord and of his Christ.</hi> Whence it is plain, in some sense or other, that the 42 months, which is the time of the Reign of the <hi>Ten-horned Beast restored,</hi> do then expire. But Times that are equal and expire together are also Synchronal.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. The <hi>Mourning of the two Witnesses</hi> and the <hi>Conculcation of the Holy City</hi> or <hi>Exteriour Court by the Gentiles</hi> begin together; as appears <hi>Apocalyps</hi> 11. where it is plainly implied that they commence at one and the same time, I mean the Mourning of the two Witnesses, and the <note place="margin">Vers. 2, 3.</note> Object of their Sorrow, the Holy City troden down by the Gentiles. And besides, at the end of the sixth Trumpet the Witnesses ascend into Heaven, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But the <hi>Woman in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> being Synchronal to the <hi>Ten-horned Beast restored,</hi> this <hi>Ten-horned Beast</hi> to the <hi>two Witnesses,</hi> these <hi>two Witnesses</hi> to the <hi>Treading under foot the outward Court</hi> or <hi>Holy City;</hi> it is manifest that all four are Synchronal one to another.</p>
                        <p>But in virtue of our Joint-Exposition it is demonstrable also that the <hi>Whore,</hi> the <hi>Two-horned Beast,</hi> and the <hi>Ten-horned Beast restored,</hi> which is plainly the <hi>Beast that was, and is not, and yet is,</hi> are Synchronal one to another. For the <hi>Whore</hi> and the <hi>Two-horned Beast</hi> are all one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany or Condition of men, by whose persuasions and directions the <hi>Pagan</hi> Empire, which had been wounded to death by the pure Preaching of the Gospel, was again made to <hi>Paganize,</hi> and so was healed of that wholsome wound, and revived again into that former Idolatrous state, and became the <hi>Beast that was, and is not, and yet is.</hi> From whence it is plain that the Authours of this Restauration of the Beast, or these Makers of the Image of the Beast, as such, began with the Beast: And they are, I mean this Beast and the <hi>Pseudo-prophet,</hi> (who is typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the <hi>Whore</hi> and the <hi>Two-horned Beast)</hi> both of them at once taken and cast alive into the lake of fire burning with Brimstone, <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calyps</hi> 19. 20. Wherefore this <hi>Ten-horned Beast restored</hi> being, as was above proved, Synchronal to the <hi>Woman in the Wilderness,</hi> to the <hi>two Witnesses,</hi> and to the <hi>Treading under foot the Holy City</hi> or <hi>Outward Court;</hi> it is manifest that the <hi>Whore of Babylon</hi> also and the <hi>Two-horned Beast</hi> are Synchronal to them, they being all Synchronal to the <hi>Ten-horned Beast restored.</hi> And that in summe, <hi>the Woman in the Wilderness, the Ten-horned Beast restored,</hi> (which is the same with the <hi>Beast that was, and is not, and yet is,</hi> or the <hi>Image of the Beast) the Holy City</hi> or <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Court troden under foot by the Gentiles, the Mourning Witnesses, the Two-horned Beast, the Whore of Babylon,</hi> that all these six are Synchro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal one to another.</p>

7. Of the Synchronism of the <hi>Virgin-Company</hi> with the <hi>Whore,</hi> (and consequently with the other five of these six) see Mr. <hi>Mede.</hi> It is not a thing that can be stuck upon, by reason of the necessary <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, and the great congruity that Christ should have his marked Souldiers, which are the Regiments of the Lamb on Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> as soon and as long as there were such as bore the <hi>Mark of the Beast,</hi> which is supposed all along his reign, seeing the <hi>receiving this Mark</hi> is nothing but an open profession of what party one is, or at least an appropriation to that party.</p>
                        <p>Of those true Members and <hi>marked</hi> or <hi>sealed</hi> Souldiers of Christ there is mention in the Seventh and Fourteenth Chapters of the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> in both which places the Number is the same, namely 144 <hi>Chiliads,</hi> or <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments;</hi> and they are said to be <hi>sealed</hi> or <hi>marked upon the fore-head:</hi> Affliction and Patience, and at last a joyful Victory over their Enemies, is the fate of them both: They are both an Apostolick Company, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horring from Idolatry, in that they are called <hi>Virgins</hi> in the fourteenth Chapter, and in that there is such caution in the ranging of the twelve Tribes in the seventh, that they have the precedence that are most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious for their zeal against Idolatry, and <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Ephraim</hi> quite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the number for their special obnoxiousness in that crime, as you may see more at large in Mr. <hi>Mede.</hi> For that these twelve Tribes are understood of <hi>Christians,</hi> and not of <hi>Jews,</hi> no man will doubt that considers how full of <hi>Israelisms</hi> the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> is every-where, insomuch as that <hi>false Christians</hi> are called <hi>counterfeit Jews,</hi> Revel. 2. 9. <hi>I know the blasphemie of them that say they are Jews, and are not, but are the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue of Satan.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is manifest therefore that the 144 thousand sealed Servants of God in the seventh Chapter, and the 144 thousand in the fourteenth Chapter, are the same Apostolick or <hi>Virgin-Company.</hi> Which is of marvellous great use to take notice of, forasmuch as it will hence be evident, that the six first Trumpets are Synchronal to our first six Synchronals, they being all Synchronal to these 144 thousand sealed Souldiers or <hi>Virgin-Regiments</hi> of Christ.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. That our first six Synchronals are Synchronal to these 144 Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments has been already proved, in that they and five of the six synchro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize with the <hi>Whore.</hi> That the <hi>Series</hi> of the first six Trumpets is Synchro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal to them is thus demonstrated; For they begin with the first Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, and continue to the end of the sixth. That they begin with the first Trumpet appears from Chap. 7. For after the effect of the sixth Seal, whenas the Procedure should have been to the seventh, which is the <hi>Seal of the Trumpets,</hi> there is a suspension awhile till these 144 thousand be <hi>sealed,</hi> and so fore-armed against the evils of the Trumpets; but they being once <hi>sealed,</hi> the seventh Seal is opened, and the seven An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels appear with their Trumpets, &amp;c. That the 144 Regiments in their condition of warfare and <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap> to their opposites that war under the mark of the Beast, terminate at the expiring of the sixth Trumpet, is plain, in that the mournful condition of the Witnesses, which synchro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizes with this warfaring condition of the Virgin-Company, ends at the ending of the sixth Trumpet: Chap. 11. 14. <hi>The second Woe is past,</hi> that
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:42932:207"/>
is to say, the sixth Trumpet is past; which is spoken immediately upon the ascending up of the Witnesses to Heaven, and the great Commotion of things that befell at the same hour. Wherefore the 144 Virgin-Regiments that were sealed at the beginning of the first Trumpet terminate, as to their conflicting condition, at the end of the sixth.</p>
                        <p>And thus you see that, according as it is in Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s Scheme of Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chronisms, the Company of the 144 thousand out of the twelve Tribes of <hi>Israel,</hi> sealed with the Seal of God in their fore-head, is as it were the <hi>communis Terminus</hi> of all those Synchronals on this side and that side thereof, as namely of the <hi>Series</hi> of the six first Trumpets on one side, and then of our six first Synchronals on the other; namely, the <hi>Ten-horned Beast restored, the Whore, the Two-horned Beast, the two mournful Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, the treading under foot the outward Court or Holy City,</hi> and <hi>the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the Wilderness.</hi>

                        <p n="9">9. So that we have a safe and fast grasp of the whole succession of things in these Prophetick Visions, having laid hold on this middle part so strongly that they cannot wriggle from us, but it will be easie for us to discover the necessary order of the rest. For the six first <hi>Seals</hi> must needs go before the seventh; and the Battel betwixt <hi>Michael</hi> and the <hi>Dragon</hi> before the Wounding or slaying of the Beast and the Restoring of him. Whence it will follow partly from the Nature of the things, and partly from their Order, that they are Synchronal; I mean the <hi>Series</hi> of the first six <hi>Seals,</hi> and the Battel of <hi>Michael</hi> with the <hi>Dragon.</hi> And that the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Court</hi> of the Temple, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But besides this, Chap. 11. the <hi>Visions</hi> begin again from the first <hi>Epocha</hi> of time that the <hi>Seals</hi> do; whence the Inward Court must be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitely Synchronal to the first six Seals, being the Outward Court be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan with the seventh.</p>
                        <p>Now that there begins a new <hi>Series</hi> of Prophecies from the first <hi>Epo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha,</hi> there be several remarkable Indications, Chap. 10. and sufficient to convince any one that has any measure of sagacity. As, first, The Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficency of that <hi>Angel,</hi> as he is called, that has the opened Book in his hand, is so great, that it is highly probable that it is no meaner person then <hi>Christ</hi> himself: the description of those bright gleams of Glory be like those in the first Chapter which are attributed unto him.

And his being pictured out with a <hi>Rain-bow about his head, and his face as the Sun,</hi> what can this signifie less then the Sun of Righteousness, which is the Eternal Word, and whose Attire is the World which himself has made? His speech also betrays him, his <hi>roaring like a Lion</hi> intimating that he is the Lion of the Tribe of
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:42932:207"/>
                           <hi>Juda.</hi> It should seem therefore that he that under the shape of a <note n="*" place="margin">Apoc. 5.</note> 
                           <hi>Lamb</hi> had opened the Book with seven Seals even to the very last Seal, appears here under another shape, beginning a new <hi>Series</hi> of Prophecies from the same <hi>Epocha</hi> in this opened Book.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. Which we may be the better assured of, if we consider that he steps into the place of the seventh Angel, and fills up the space of the seventh Trumpet with seven Thunders. Which is an evident sign that the whole course of the seven Seals is run through to the last Thunder-clap of the Day of Judgment, so far, or rather in such a manner, as he thought good at this time, till he began afresh again.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. Thirdly, In that he swears <hi>that there shall be Time no longer, but in the days of the voice of the seventh Angel, when he shall sound, and the Mystery of God be finished, as he had declared to his servants the Prophets,</hi> (in which certainly there is a regard to <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 7.) it is plain that there is a forbearing to proceed explicitly to the very end of the seventh Seal, that is, to the special and determinate effect of the seventh Trumpet. Which suspension does not a little assure us that there is a Regression; and whither, I pray, if not to the very first <hi>Epocha</hi> of a new <hi>Series</hi> of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies? Nay a Regression is necessarily implied from the Angel's swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>there shall be no more time</hi> then what is taken up in the seventh Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, which sounds not till the Resurrection of the Witnesses, as you may see in the following Chapter, ver. 14, 15.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. Fourthly, This either <hi>new Book</hi> (which yet I do not now think so probable, but rather that it is the former Book, all whose Seals are opened by the Lamb, and is still in his hand, though he be now under another shape) or new condition of the Book (it being an <hi>opened Book</hi> now, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as before it was a <hi>sealed</hi> one; the first a Book to be look'd upon with the eyes, this to be swallowed down into the belly) does imply a new <hi>Series</hi> of Prophecies to be begun, and of another nature from the former; the one, suppose, respecting the <hi>Fate of the Empire,</hi> the other <hi>of the Church,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> would have it. But to have all this new preparation for no new design, were strange and incredible.</p>
                        <p n="14">14. Fifthly, That which Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> urges of a <hi>voice from Heaven as of a Trumpet</hi> talking with S. <hi>John,</hi> is not altogether devoid of force. For, as I have noted else-where, the mention of the <hi>Trumpet,</hi> which is in this third place suppressed, and which Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> would have understood, may be omitted, that the meaning of the Prophecies may not lie too bare. But it is observable that there is a considerable Affinity betwixt the entrance into the first <hi>Series</hi> of those Prophecies of the <hi>Seals,</hi> and these of the <hi>opened Book.</hi> For it is plain chap. 4. 1. that he says there was <hi>a door opened in Heaven,</hi> and that <hi>the first voice, which was as of a Trumpet,</hi> communed with him. So here, chap. 10. he saith, that <hi>a voice from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> communed with him, <gap reason="foreign">

And the rather because that voice onely

                           </gap> is most naturally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to Chap. 4. 1. and therefore indicates a new beginning of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies from that very <hi>Epocha.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="15">15. But, sixthly and lastly, Upon <hi>John</hi>'s swallowing down the Book, we may observe such circumstances as do strongly intimate a new <hi>Series</hi> of Prophecies, wherein the Fate of the Church may seem chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. First, in that it is said to be <hi>bitter in his stomach, though sweet in his mouth.</hi> Of which <hi>bitterness</hi> of these Prophecies more then of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer no reason can be given if they respect the same Subject, and one does not concern the <hi>Empire,</hi> the other the <hi>Church of God.</hi> Wherefore the <hi>Fate of the Church</hi> is contained in these, and consequently from as high an <hi>Epocha</hi> as those of the <hi>Empire.</hi> Secondly, in that the Angel saith <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> which, unless it were to begin again to prophesie from the first <hi>Epocha</hi> of the times he has hitherto prophesied of, would be a very unaccountable passage. For he had prophesied in another sense again and again already, in seeing and declaring so many Visions as he had. Thirdly, in that it is added, <hi>Before many Peoples and Nations and Tongues and Kings,</hi> it is a sign that he does not proceed to some few particular things behind, but is to act more rousingly, must <hi>altiùs rem repetere;</hi> and having taken his repast in devouring the <hi>little Book,</hi> begin his race afresh from the first <hi>Epocha,</hi> and with as general concernment to the world as the Prophecies of the <hi>Seals</hi> were.</p>
                        <p n="16">16. These considerations, I think, may induce any one to believe that the Eleventh Chapter begins from the first <hi>Epocha</hi> of the Apocalyptick Visions. But adde to all this, that the Twelfth Chapter does, as has been already demonstrated: for there is no Vision in the <hi>Seals</hi> higher then the fight of <hi>Michael</hi> with the <hi>Dragon.</hi> Which is a Demonstration that S. <hi>John</hi> in this second bout of Prophesying returns to the highest <hi>Epocha,</hi> and that he begins a new <hi>Series</hi> of Prophecies, namely, concerning the <hi>Church.</hi> Which being thus plainly evinced, I appeal to any one if it be at all likely or possible that he should begin with such an headless Vision as would fall short of the first <hi>Epocha</hi> three or four hundred years.</p>
                        <p n="17">17. Wherefore assuredly, as the <hi>Outward Court troden down by the Gentiles</hi> is Synchronal to the first six Trumpets in the seventh Seal, so the <hi>Inward Court</hi> is Synchronal to the first six Seals; which was the thing to be demonstrated, and which is a Conclusion of excellent use and weighty consideration, as may appear in its due place.</p>
                        <p n="18">18. Finally, as our Middle Synchronals have thus necessarily detected those that precede, so they will with like facility and certainty discover them that succeed. For the <hi>Thousand years</hi> wherein the <hi>Saints reign, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan is bound,</hi> the <hi>Palmiferous Company</hi> triumphs, and the <hi>Heavenly Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi> is seen upon Earth, all these must in some sense plainly Synchro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize with the seventh Trumpet. <hi>And the seventh Angel sounded, and</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Apoc. 11. 15.</note> 
                           <hi>there were great voices in Heaven, saying, The Kingdoms of this world are become the Kingdoms of the Lord and of his Christ, and he shall reign for ever and ever.</hi> So that it is plain that the <hi>Millennial</hi> Empire of Christ
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:42932:208"/>
and of his Saints is under the seventh Trumpet. The <hi>Palmiferous Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Apoc. 7. 9.</note> also immediately succeed the 144 Virgin Regiments which are Synchronal to the first six Trumpets, whence necessarily this company of <hi>Palm-bearers</hi> are under the seventh. The <hi>Fall of Babylon</hi> also contermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates with the sixth Trumpet, and therefore the <hi>New Jerusalem,</hi> which succeeds it, must needs be found in the seventh. And, lastly, <hi>Satan,</hi> who fought with <hi>Michael</hi> all along the first six Seals, and bore such sway in the Kingdom of Antichrist in the first six Trumpets, cannot be said to be <hi>bound, cast into the bottomless Pit and sealed up there for a thousand years,</hi> till the <hi>Millennial</hi> Empire of Christ, till the glory and brightness of the <hi>Heavenly Jerusalem upon Earth,</hi> till the Victory and Triumph of the <hi>Palm-bearing Company,</hi> that is, till the sounding of the last Trumpet; not onely the <hi>Series</hi> of the Synchronals, but the very nature of the things themselves, forcing the <hi>Ligation of Satan</hi> into this last Period of times.</p>
                        <p>This is very easie and plain. But if any one be unsatisfi'd, he may reade Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> Part 2. Synchronism 4, 5, 6, 7. where he shall have a more full and copious demonstration of these Synchronals contemporizing with the seventh Trumpet. But how this <hi>contemporizing</hi> is to be understood, will better appear out of this following Chapter.</p>

1. I Had almost omitted the placing of <hi>the Vials;</hi> the first six whereof Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> ranges within the sixth Trumpet, briefly upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: Because they being the seven last Plagues of the Beast, they are to begin with the inclining of the Beast to ruine. But it was proved above, that the 42 months of the Beast's domineering over the Saints and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming them expired with the last breath of the sixth Trumpet, as all those middle Synchronals do. And it is as true that the <hi>Throne of the Beast</hi> does not wax dark before the fifth Vial. Wherefore he concludes, that at the least five Vials, if not six, precede the seventh Trumpet.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Which Ratiocination of Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s were very firm, if we could be sure that the meaning of the Continuance of the Beast for 42 months were such as he supposes it, namely, That this Duration or Reign of his is to be understood <hi>absolutely,</hi> That he shall reign so long and no longer, and not <hi>comparatively,</hi> That after 42 months he shall not reign with that full power and victory over the Saints, so keeping them under that they cannot appear a distinct Polity able to defend themselves from his Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannies and Cruelties.</p>
                        <p>Which latter may be a warrantable meaning of the Prophecie as well as the other, namely, That as soon as there appears a Kingdom or Polity of truly Evangelical or Apostolical Christians, not Superstitious, nor Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous, nor Persecutive and Bloudy, but such as joyn heartily with one another in the plain Points of Christian Religion, and make no other <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals</hi> then the undoubted meaning of the Word of God requires, and leave men free in the rest; That as soon, I say, as such a Polity as this is in being, the 42 months of the Beast may be said to expire as to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tireness of his Reign; and also for that there is that set on foot which will certainly be his ruine, and therefore in the Prophetick style he is accounted as ruined already. According to which tenour Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> has interpreted that of <hi>Esay,</hi> 
                           <note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 21. 9.</note> 
                           <hi>Babylon is fallen, is fallen:</hi> whenas in the time of <hi>Esay</hi> there was onely the first Ground-work laid for her ruine by the <hi>Medes,</hi> who casting off the <hi>Assyrian</hi> yoke and rescuing themselves into liberty, and building <hi>Ecbatana</hi> under their new King <hi>Deioces,</hi> laid the foundations of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom fatal to the City of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Nor can we well understand that in the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> upon the sounding of the seventh Trumpet, to that height it seems to be spoken, <hi>The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the world are become the Kingdoms of the Lord and of his Christ.</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Chap. 11. 15.</note> Of which I must confess I cannot but surmise the most sober meaning to be something parallel to that saying of our Saviour, <hi>Now is the judgment of this world, now shall the Prince of this world be cast out;</hi> and yet he kept <note place="margin">Joh. 12. 31.</note> possession till <hi>Constantine</hi>'s time. But in such a sense as the Kingdoms of the world at the beginning of the seventh Trumpet are become the Kingdoms of Christ, the Beast has lost his Kingdom and his 42 months are expired.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Wherefore there is great caution to be used in understanding the Prophetick Expressions, which always sound very high and lofty, and express things so as most fills the mind and strikes the phancie, whenas if they were set down strictly and restrainedly to a <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, it would
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:42932:209"/>
flat the Height and Majesty of the Style, and make it lose its rapturous power with the Reader; besides that considerable usefulness which such courageous and triumphant Expressions may carry along with them.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Nor is this onely a possible meaning of the Expiration of the 42 months of the Beast with the sixth Trumpet, but also very probable. First, because the Seventh Trumpet is one of the <hi>Woe-Trumpets,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore signifies ruine and destruction in some sense or other. <hi>The second Woe is past,</hi> (that is to say, the prefiguration of it, in such a sense as <hi>Ovid</hi> says, <hi>Janus habet finem.</hi> But it is plain that the effect of the sixth Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet may continue after the seventh is begun, as the effects of the first Seal and first Trumpet do after the second are begun, the succession, in the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, of these parts of the Visions lying not always as the quarries of a Pavement, but as the scales of Fishes, one reaching over part of the other. But this by the bye.) <hi>and behold, the third Woe cometh quickly;</hi> which is this seventh Trumpet, which therefore is a blast of Destruction upon all the Powers that oppose the Kingdom of Christ: Which supposes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that he is going on conquering and to conquer, and that all the work is not done at the entrance of the seventh Trumpet, but so much is behind that in all likelihood the 42 months of the Beast are not expired in any other sense then such as I have already defined.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Which will appear more reasonable, if in the second place we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the <hi>seven Thunders,</hi> which I doubt not but are the contents of the seventh Trumpet; and the <note n="*" place="margin">Apoc. 10. 3. 4.</note> Text says, That that mighty Angel (which Expositors ordinarily interpret to be Christ, the Lion of the Tribe of <hi>Juda) cried with a loud voice, as when a Lion roareth,</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, that is, <hi>and while he cried, the seven Thunders uttered their voices.</hi> Wherefore this roaring of the Lion of the Tribe of <hi>Juda</hi> all along those seven Thunders, and the Distinction of the space of the seventh Trumpet into seven portions, wherein certainly a state of War and of seven notable Battels and Victories, or Judgments and Triumphs, in some sense or other is understood, does imply a vast Continent that <hi>de jure</hi> belongs to the Kingdom of Christ, unsubdued at the beginning of the seventh Trumpet. And therefore it is very reasonable that a very great share of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the jurisdiction and guidance of the <hi>Two-horned Beast,</hi> even at the first blast of the last Trumpet or within the sound of the first Thunder.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Thirdly, It is said of the <hi>Whore of Babylon,</hi> who is adjudged to be burned, that her smoke ascends <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, that is, to the <hi>remotest and utmost Ages of the world.</hi> But there is no smoke but there must be some fire, nor any fire but there will be matter combustible. Wherefore that passage insinuates that something of this <hi>Whore</hi> will be left to be burning to the utmost Ages of the world, even to the Ages of the last Trumpet. And it is plain that while some Kings burn her, others pity her, such as had committed fornication with her, and lament over her <note place="margin">Apoc. 18.</note> while they see the smoke of her burning.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, It seems more consonant to the Wisedom of God to continue these Antichristian <hi>Canaanites</hi> for a time, partly for a foil to set off the purity and unspottedness, the beauty and loveliness of the Apostolick
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:42932:210"/>
Church, and partly to be an excitement and exercise of their Zeal, Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancy, and all other Graces and Vertues.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Fifthly and lastly, The <hi>Epocha</hi> of the Middle Synchronals is so firmly fastened to the time of about 400 years from Christ, both by the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the short space of the seventh King's continuance in respect of the sixth, and of the Inward Court in respect of the Outward, as also of the exquisite fitness of Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s Interpretation of the first Trumpet; that there is no likelihood that the Remains of the 42 months or the 1260 years of the Reign of the Beast should suffice for such a Mutation of the Empire, as will amount to any higher a sense of finishing his Continuance then I have given: and Interpreters (though Prophets write in Rapture and Ecstasie) are bound to expound their Visions with caution and sobriety. Unless the Affairs of <hi>Europe</hi> should break of a sudden, as <hi>Olaus</hi> says the Frozen Ocean does, and roars along like thunder with the crack of the Ice, and then immediately sinks, (which is a miracle above belief) I see no probability at all of any other sense of the stinting the Reign of the Beast to 42 months then I have already declared.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. The Consequence of which Conclusion will be, that there is no ground left for placing the seven <hi>Vials</hi> before the seventh Trumpet; and therefore it may justly be suspected a kind of Luxation to the Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical Scheme of Prophecies, which Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> has otherwise ingeniously and judiciously disposed. Wherefore let every member take its right place, and let the seven Vials either run parallel to the seven Thunders, (which then its likely were the rather suppressed, because they were to be supplied by these) let them run within the seventh Trumpet, as the seven Trumpets within the seventh Seal: for this appears the most easie, natural and proportional disposing of them. And they seem to claim the right of this posture in that they are called the <note n="*" place="margin">Apoc. 15. 1.</note> 
                           <hi>seven last plagues</hi> wherein the wrath of God is finished or ended; which would not be if they were not the Plagues of the last Trumpet: Or else at least let them Synchronize with the first Thunder, as the seven Thunders do with the last Trumpet. Which I shall more determinately discourse of in its proper place.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. To all which you may adde what we find <hi>Apoc.</hi> 15. where there is mention made of those that <hi>have already got the victory</hi> over the Beast, and like the <hi>Israelites</hi> escaped out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and therefore having the <hi>Harps of God in their hands, sing the Song of Moses the servant of God, and the Song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous are thy works,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Apoc. 15. 3, 4.</note> 
                           <hi>Lord God Almighty, just and true are thy ways, thou King of Saints. Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorifie thy Name? For thou onely art holy: for all Nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy judgments are made manifest.</hi> Which answers exactly to our supposition, That there is onely at first some particular Victory and restrained Reign of Christ to some Nations or Kingdoms; which being a pledge of future successes, that Acclamation was in Heaven, <hi>The Kingdoms of this world are become the Kingdoms of the Lord and his Christ.</hi> Of which this Song of the Harpers may be the truest Comment, <hi>All Nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy judgments are made manifest.</hi> Not that they are come already, but will assuredly fall under his subjection.

But after this is the effusion of the seven <hi>Vials,</hi> as is plain out of the order of things in the Text; whether you take notice of those Middle Synchronals which are set out by the time of their continuance (as <note n="*" place="margin">Apoc. 13. 5.</note> that of the <hi>restored Beast,</hi> to which is added presently the <note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 14.</note> 
                           <hi>Virgin-Company,</hi> as running in a parallel opposition thereto) after which this Song of <hi>Moses</hi> follows, as a Thanksgiving for those first Victories over the Beast; or consider the Temple opened in Heaven, which in order follows after this Song, and out of which the Angels come that have the <hi>seven Vials.</hi> For from both it is intimated that the <hi>Vials</hi> run all up into the seventh Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet. Which is farther still to be confirmed from Chap. 11. where the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God</hi> is also <hi>opened in Heaven,</hi> and <hi>the Ark of the Covenant</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned as here, and a compendious Symbolical Periphrasis of wrath and vengeance; so that it is hugely reasonable to conceive they mean the same thing. But that appearance (Chap. 11.) of the <hi>Temple</hi> and <hi>Ark</hi> is after the seventh Trumpet began to sound. Therefore the <hi>seven Vials</hi> are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the blast of the seventh Trumpet.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. In short, (and yet to reach to the bottom of this present business) it is of exceeding great moment to take notice that the seven Middle Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chronals of the Prophecies of the <hi>opened Book</hi> have their fulfilling either <hi>quoad speciem</hi> or <hi>quoad gradus, as to the kind</hi> or <hi>as to the degrees in the same kind,</hi> one degree being sufficient for the fulfilling of the Prophecies <hi>quoad speciem;</hi> and that one of these Synchronals cannot be fulfilled <hi>quoad speciem</hi> or <hi>quoad gradus,</hi> but <hi>ipso facto</hi> they are all fulfilled, they being so intimately united one with another. As for example, Suppose that but in one State or Kingdom in Christendom the Church has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come purely Apostolical in Doctrine and Discipline, in Life and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, it follows from hence that <hi>quoad speciem</hi> the Reign of the Beast is expired, that is, that there is one <hi>Specimen</hi> or Instance of this specifick Event, namely, of such an Expiration of the Rule of the Beast as brings along with it the Resurrection of the Witnesses and the Succession of the Kingdom of Christ in the place. Which if it fall out at or towards the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration of the 42 months and from a fit <hi>Epocha,</hi> the Prophecie is truly fulfilled in all circumstances <hi>quoad speciem,</hi> in this first Example, but may proceed farther and farther afterwards in Degrees or Latitude.</p>
                        <p>But the thing that I contend for is this, That this first way of fulfilling is onely aimed at in these Middle Synchronals of the Prophecies of the <hi>opened Book,</hi> and that the Degrees are reserved for the <hi>Vials</hi> in the last Trumpet.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. And what I instanced in the Reign of the Beast must be true of all the rest, That their fulfilling that contemporizes with the first six Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, and terminates upon the first blast of the seventh, is a fulfilling onely <hi>quoad speciem</hi> or <hi>quoad esse,</hi> not <hi>quoad gradus,</hi> which are reserved for the seventh Trumpet. And my reason is, Because all these seven Synchronals are so nearly united or signifie so much one and the same, that they must necessarily advance or be retarded together. As for example, We cannot conceive the <hi>Whore of Babylon</hi> burnt in any one Kingdom, that is, the
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:42932:211"/>
Clergy to cease to be Idolatrous and Antichristian, and to become purely Apostolick in Doctrine and Discipline, but we may be sure that the Civil Magistrate ceases there to be Antichristian too, and that the <hi>Ten-horned Beast</hi> in this place has finished his fourty two months; the <hi>Two-horned Beast</hi> also vanishes, as being one and the same with the <hi>Whore;</hi> the <hi>Witnesses</hi> break off their mournful Prophecie, as having here nothing to complain of; the <hi>Outward Court</hi> is in this part cleansed of the Pollution of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles that trod it under foot; the <hi>Woman</hi> is here no longer hid in the <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness</hi> amongst brutish Idolaters, but appears as a glorious City upon an Hill to attract the eyes of the Nations unto it; and, lastly, the <hi>Marked</hi> or <hi>Sealed Virgin-Regiments</hi> lose their <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> in this place, and instead of fighting Souldiers become a College of peaceful Priests clothed in white, and are before the Throne of God and serve him day and night in his Temple.</p>
                        <p>Thus jointly will these Middle Synchronals ever be fulfilled, be it more or less, whether barely <hi>quoad speciem,</hi> or repeatedly <hi>quoad gradus;</hi> the first fulfilling conterminating with the Entrance of the seventh Trumpet, the other advancing in it to the effusion of the last <hi>Vial.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="13">13. And what is worthy our observation, those last Synchronals we have above noted, namely, <hi>The Millennial Reign of Christ, The Palm-bearing Company, The new Jerusalem,</hi> and <hi>The binding of Satan,</hi> do commence in such a way and proportion as these Middle Synchronals ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. But that special and most eminent <hi>Epocha</hi> of the <hi>Ligation of Satan,</hi> as also of the <hi>Millennial Empire,</hi> I conceive commenceth not till after the seventh Vial; and the <note n="*" place="margin">Apoc. 20. 3.</note> 
                           <hi>Devil's being let loose again for a little time</hi> is to be placed somewhat before the voice of the seventh Thunder, wherewith the whole Earth is to be set on fire, and Death and Hell to be all of a flame thereby. But the intermediate space is the <hi>Millennium</hi> eminently so styled.</p>
                        <p n="14">14. This I believe is the truest and safest apprehension we can have of the <hi>Series</hi> of things in the Apocalyptick Visions. Which having thus competently cleared, I shall with the greater satisfaction to my self, and to others, I hope, proceed to the producing such passages out of this Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Volume as predict the several kinds of <hi>Lapses of the Church into An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristianism:</hi> for we now know whereabout to seek for them, namely, among the Middle Synchronals of either Prophecie, which reach from about the four hundredth year after Christ to these very Ages.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p n="1">1. BEsides those notable and leading Prophecies of the <hi>Idolatry of the Church</hi> in the Thirteenth and Seventeenth Chapters of the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> there are farther Intimations of the same Lapse in other places. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed no less then six of the seven Middle Synchronals of the Prophecies of the <hi>opened Book</hi> are Predictions of this Idolatrous state of the Church. Three of which we have done withall, namely, <hi>the Whore of Babylon, the Two-horned Beast,</hi> and <hi>the Beast with seven Heads and ten Horns.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The first of those three behind is the <hi>Outward Court</hi> or <hi>Holy City troden under foot by the Gentiles</hi> for the space of 42 months. Which <note place="margin">Apoc. 11.</note> 
                           <hi>Outward Court</hi> or <hi>Holy City,</hi> that it is to be understood of those that make a visible profession of Christianity in the world, appears from the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Synchronisms, that of the <hi>Temple</hi> or <hi>Inward Court</hi> reaching from the beginning of the Church to the time of its Lapse into such a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as was not commensurable to the <hi>Reed of the Angel,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rejected. <hi>The Court that is without the Temple,</hi>

But the <hi>Outward Court</hi> belongs to the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> having been cast off long before, it is plain from hence that all this is understood of <hi>Christendom.</hi> Nor is it any more wonder that the <hi>Jewish Temple</hi> or <hi>Courts</hi> thereof should typify the Christian Church, then that their <hi>Tribes</hi> did, Chap. 7. For this is but an usual <hi>Israelism.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Wherefore Christendom being the Scene of these Transactions, and it being presently after added concerning this <hi>Outward Court,</hi> that it is given to the Gentiles, and that they shall tread under foot the <hi>Holy City fourty two months;</hi> (which <hi>Holy City</hi> and <hi>Outward Court</hi> is in a ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                           </gap>ner the same thing, the very Camp of <hi>Israel</hi> being the Outward Court in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, and this Outward Court the Receptacle of the People of <hi>Israel</hi> at their solemn times of worship when the Temple was built, as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> has well observed) it is evident, Christendom was to be over-run with <hi>Gentilism,</hi> that is, with <hi>Paganism,</hi> the life and soul whereof is <hi>Idolatry,</hi> so long a time; forasmuch as the <hi>Holy City</hi> or <hi>Outward Court</hi> is supposed here in being, that is to say, a people that do profess Christianity and are externally dedicated to God, but in the <hi>interim</hi> are over-grown with an Heathenish kind of Superstition and Idolatry.</p>
                        <p>And in that this <hi>Outward Court</hi> is said <hi>to be given to the Gentiles,</hi> that is answerable to what is wrote in Ch. 17. <hi>For God has put it into their hearts</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Ver. 17.</note> 
                           <hi>to fulfill his will, and to agree and give their Kingdom unto the Beast, untill the words of God shall be fulfilled.</hi> So fatal, as I may so speak, does this Apostasy of the Church seem to be, and so little reason have those great Politicians of <hi>Italy</hi> to sacrifice to their own Nets, as I have above noted, and impute all to their own wit, when they have apparently
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:42932:212"/>
hitherto rowed with the stream. But the times are coming wherein they will find the course of things turned, and their Resistence of a due Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation a fighting against God. Which is worth their observing, that they may take up in due time.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The next of those latter Synchronalls is <hi>The Woman in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> namely, That Woman that <note n="*" place="margin">Apocal. 12. 1.</note> 
                           <hi>wears upon her head a Crown of twelve Starrs,</hi> whose glory it is to be that pure and Apostolick Church, uncontaminated with after-Superstitions and Idolatries; that Woman that is said <note n="*" place="margin">Vers. 2.</note> 
                           <hi>to travail in birth and was pained to be delivered,</hi> and after long throes and pangs, that is to say, sharp persecutions, at last <note n="*" place="margin">Vers. 5.</note> 
                           <hi>brought forth a Male-childe that should rule the Nations.</hi> This Woman not chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging place herself, is notwithstanding said <note n="*" place="margin">Vers. 14.</note> 
                           <hi>to have the wings of an Eagle given her,</hi> whereby she fled into the Wilderness, there to be secured from the persecution of the old red Dragon, which is the bloudy Pagan Powers of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire as yet unconverted to Christianity: And indeed by being thus escaped, though but into a <hi>Wilderness,</hi> she was sheltred from them. But in that she is said to be <hi>in a Wilderness,</hi> it is an intimation that she is hid and blended amongst them that under the outward profession of Christianity did again <hi>Paganize</hi> in their Superstitious and Idolatrous Worship; as you may understand out of the acknowledged meaning of <hi>Wilderness</hi> in the <hi>Prophetick-Alphabet.</hi> For that <hi>Men,</hi> not a mere Solitude of <hi>Trees</hi> and <hi>Beasts,</hi> is understood by <hi>Wilderness,</hi> is plain also out of that in the Evangelist, <hi>The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.</hi> Which he spoke not to <hi>Beasts</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Matt. 3. 3.</note> and <hi>Trees,</hi> but to <hi>Men,</hi> whom these resemble when they are wholly taken up in the functions and delights of the mere Vegetal and Animal nature, of which Superstition and Idolatry is one part, as I have above intimated.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The sense therefore of this Prophecy is this, That the pure and Apostolick Church, though sheltered therewithall for a time from the red Dragon, was over-run with a kind of Christiano-Paganism from one side to the other, from the East wing to the West wing of the <hi>Eagle</hi> or <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; which, because it had its <hi>Eastern</hi> and <hi>Western</hi> Caesars, is figured with <hi>two wings,</hi> and that with greater facility then the <hi>Leopard</hi> in <note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 7. 6.</note> 
                           <hi>Daniel</hi> with <hi>four,</hi> which signified the quadripartition of the <hi>Greek</hi> Empire into four parts. This therefore intimates the <hi>Greek</hi> Church as well as the <hi>Latine</hi> to be culpable in this matter of Idolatrous worship, correspondent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to what I have said of the <hi>two Horns of the Beast,</hi> that they intimate the two Imperial Patriarchates, that of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the other of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> the two chief Summities of the Idolatrizing Clergie. This I doubt not but is the meaning of the <hi>Woman in the Wilderness,</hi> though it seems some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hard that she is said <hi>to fly into this Desert,</hi> this Desert rather coming upon or over-running her in the thing signified.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. But it is an <hi>Hypallage,</hi> of which this is no solitary Example, but like that of <hi>casting Hades into the lake of fire and brimstone,</hi> whenas that fire is rather cast into <hi>Hades</hi> at the Conflagration of the world by Thunder and Lightening; 2 Figure even needlesly affected for Elegancy sake by Poets.

Brutium ponto feriente Corum.</l>
                           </q>
Such an <hi>Hypallage</hi> as this I suspect also to be in <hi>Daniel</hi> ch. 7. where he speaks of the <hi>Kingdoms under the whole Heaven being given to the Saints of the most High.</hi> The meaning whereof may be nothing else but that they that are possessed of these Kingdoms may turn Saints, that is, Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours and Abettours of the pure and Apostolick Religion, unsophisticated with the Idolatrous Inventions and Injunctions of Antichrist. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it were desirable that those that are over-ready to phansy themselves <hi>Saints,</hi> if this <hi>Hypallage</hi> does not please them, that at least they would imitate the modesty of the Expression of the Text, and would not take Kingdoms before they be given them.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> interprets this Vision of the <hi>Woman in the Wilderness</hi> in something a different sense from us; paralleling the <hi>Israelites</hi> flight from <hi>Pharaoh</hi> into the Wilderness to the Woman's flight from the red Dragon, and their liberty of serving <hi>Jehovah</hi> there after the Rites appointed by <hi>Moses</hi> to the liberty the Christians had to exercize their Religion, their lapses also into Idolatry to the Idolatrous Apostasy of the Church of Christ in this condition, and finally their 42 Journeys in the Wilderness mentioned <hi>Numb.</hi> 33. to the 42 months the Woman is said to be in the Desert. Which if they had been expresly set down in those termes, and not onely equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently in 1260 <hi>dayes,</hi> or <hi>a time and times and half a time,</hi> it had been the more pat and convincing. But however his Interpretation is very plausible and handsome, and may be one sense of the Type, though not the onely sense. For it is the property of these Prophetick Types to abound with Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusions. But the state of the Church in the Wilderness being the same with that of her bondage in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> as appears from <hi>Apocal.</hi> 11. in that respect I account that Interpretation I have given more passable, or rather more Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick. <note place="margin">Ver. 8.</note> But I see no need that they should one exclude another, the Reign of the Dragon being truly the Reign of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> over these new <hi>Israelites,</hi> (saving that this of the Dragon was more bloudy;) and the state of the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness in which the Woman is hid being not onely a Revival of that bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of <hi>Aegypt</hi> again, but the restoring again also of the Dragon as Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous, in fabricating so lively an Image of him in this new <hi>Pagano-Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism,</hi> which the Apocalyptick Visions do so copiously predict.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. The third and last of these latter Synchronalls of the <hi>Book-Prophecy</hi> is the <note n="*" place="margin">Apocal. 14. 1.</note> 
                           <hi>Virgin-Company,</hi> the sealed Souldiers of the Lamb upon Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> whose Description is admirable and mysterious. For in that they are said to be 144 Chiliads or Regiments, it is not the defining of their number, but their nature or quality, according to the use of the ancient <hi>Cabbala</hi> that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes the property of things by Numbers. The Root therefore of 144, which is <hi>twelve,</hi> plainly detects them to be the true disciples and successours of that Church that Christ founded in his twelve Apostles, and that they had not adulterated the Christian Religion by any Idolatrous worship or unwarrantable Institutes of men, but that they were faithfull to him whose name they bore on their fore-heads, as the marked servants of God and of the Lamb, and being bought with the price of his most precious bloud would not become the servants of men in any thing that was to the dishonour or disinterest of him that bought them.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. TO these Middle Synchronalls of the <hi>Book-Prophecy</hi> we will onely adde the Vision of the <hi>Sixth Trumpet,</hi> the Prediction of S. <hi>Paul</hi> concerning the <hi>Apostasy of the Latter times,</hi> and that Prophecy in <hi>Daniel</hi> from whence he seems to have drawn that Prediction; and then we shall have done.</p>
                        <p>And truly the Vision of the Sixth Trumpet is very signal and notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. That it is meant concerning the <hi>Turks</hi> invading Christendom, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> has interpreted, I have abundantly made good against <hi>Grotius</hi> in my <note n="*" place="margin">Book 5. Ch. 16. Sect. 5.</note> 
                           <hi>Mystery of Godliness.</hi> To which we adde briefly, That it is plain that the Invasion of these <hi>Euphratean</hi> Horsemen is long after the Empire became Christian, nay indeed <hi>Pagano-Christian;</hi> forasmuch as it is the <hi>Sixth Trumpet,</hi> the last of those that taken together in order Synchronize with the reign of the <hi>Pagano-Christian</hi> Power, <hi>The Beast that was, and is not, and yet is.</hi> And for the <hi>place</hi> as well as the <hi>time,</hi> that it was the Empire to which this Vision belongs, appears from that often-repeated Character whereby it uses to be denoted, the proportion of a <hi>third part;</hi> For <hi>the</hi> 
                           <note n="*" place="margin">Apocal. 9. 15.</note> 
                           <hi>third part of men</hi> are here said to be killed. But that the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was look'd upon by S. <hi>John</hi> as the <hi>third part</hi> of the known World in his Age, is evident in that Description of the red Dragon with seven Heads and ten Horns, in that he is said to have struck down <hi>the third part of the Starrs</hi> with his tail to the ground, <hi>Apocal.</hi> 12. 4.</p>
                        <p>Moreover the posture of these Horsemen was such, as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> has also noted, in respect of S. <hi>John</hi> in <hi>Patmos</hi> his seeing them coming as from <hi>Euphrates,</hi> that they must needs march upon the Territories of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire: Which also the consideration of our third Rule of interpreting Prophecies does more fully assure us of. For what had S. <hi>John</hi> to doe with any Visions but such as concerned the Church of Christ? Wherefore there is no reason to doubt but that Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s Interpretation of the Sixth Trumpet is very true.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. From whence it will evidently appear, that there is a Prevision of that gross Idolatry which would be in both the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Church. For after the description of that numerous Army of the <hi>Turks</hi> under the Type of the <hi>Euphratean</hi> Horsemen, and the great Execution they did, the <hi>third part of men</hi> being killed by the fire, smoke and brimstone that issued out of their Horses mouths that roared like Lions against their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, to which you may adde the preceding Plague of the <hi>Saracens,</hi> those

                           <note place="margin">Apoc. 9. 20, 21.</note> 
                           <hi>killed by these Plagues repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship Devils, and Idols of Gold and Silver and Brass and Stone and of Wood, which neither can see nor hear nor walk; Neither repented they of their Murthers, nor of their Sorceries, nor of their Fornication, nor of their Thefts.</hi> Can there be a more express and plain Prophecy of the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of the Christian Empire then this? For the sense plainly is this, That though the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Saracens</hi> had over-run the <hi>Eastern</hi> Churches, and laid all wast with fire and sword, yet the <hi>Western</hi> Part of the Empire did not lay it to heart, (nor indeed the <hi>Greek</hi> Church as they should do) but that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> did notwithstanding persist in their Idolatrous worship, in the worshipping of their <hi>Daemonia</hi> or Daemons, the Souls of men departed, (our English Translation reads it <hi>Devils,</hi> and none certainly (whenas they are not God) would receive Divine honour after their deaths, unless they were become <hi>Devils;</hi> so great a <note n="*" place="margin">See Book 1. Ch. 12. Ver. 3. Sect. 4.</note> Reproach is that pretended honour the <hi>Romanists</hi> give to the Saints) in the worshipping of Idols of Gold and of Silver and of Brass, &amp;c. <hi>which neither can hear nor see nor walk.</hi> This is added as an Aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and more palpable detection of the madness or sottishness of this Sin.</p>
                        <p>And is it not the same in the Images of the <hi>Saints</hi> as in the Images of the <hi>Heathen Gods?</hi> Can the Images of the Saints see more clearly, hear more quickly, or walk more nimbly then the Idols of the Heathen? Wherefore we see such a ground of the reprehension of this sin of <hi>Idolatry</hi> is alledged as is common to that of the <hi>Pagans</hi> with this of those that call themselves <hi>Christians.</hi> So that there is no hole for them to escape out at.</p>
                        <p>But there are other Crimes also which the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the severe judgment of God against the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, has not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of: as namely of her <hi>Murthers,</hi> in shedding of innocent bloud, or cruelly and hatefully persecuting men under pretence of Heresy; of <hi>Sorcery,</hi> in such a sense as I have expounded it in my <note n="*" place="margin">Book 1. Chap. 18.</note> 
                           <hi>Idea of Antichristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anism;</hi> of <hi>Fornication,</hi> in the unnatural Constitution of their unclean Clergie; and of <hi>Thefts,</hi> in their frauds and impostures to emunge the simple people of their money. But these things belong not to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Head.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. In the mean time it is exceedingly worth our Observation, of what infinite consequence it would be to the safety and prosperity of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, if they would reform from this gross sin of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> the worshipping of <hi>Daemons</hi> and Images of Gold and Silver and other Materials. For who knows, or rather who knows not, but that God, who brought that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great scourge of the <hi>Turk</hi> upon the Christian world for their gross Idolatries, may make him flow back again into his own Chanell, if we would once return to that ancient, pure and Apostolick Christianity? For the Cause of this great evil once removed, the Evil it self will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved also.</p>
                        <p>Whence it is plain that they are the truest Friends to Christendom, even to <hi>Rome</hi> herself, that do not sooth them up in their sins, by mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:42932:214"/>
and hiding their foul miscarriages, but deal apertly and plainly with them for their own safety; that neither admit nor invent subterfuges to countenance or palliate their Idolatrous and Superstitious practices, but tell them plainly how much they are apostatized from the true worship of God and Christ into Paganism and Idolatry. Better are the Rebukes of a faithfull Friend then the hired flatteries of a glozing Mercenary.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Wherefore persisting in the same liberty of speech, I shall adventure to pronounce that that Prediction of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. respects the <hi>Apostasy of the Empire into Idolatrous worship,</hi> by means of the seducing and seduced Clergie thereof, who taught them to give religious worship to mere men departed this life, and so turned the deceased Saints of God, as much as in them lay, into Pagan <hi>Daemons.</hi> The words of the Prediction are these: <hi>Now the Spirit speaketh expresly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of Devils; speaking lies in Hypocrisy, having their conscience seared with an hot-iron, forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats,</hi> &amp;c. It should be rendred, <hi>Through the Hypocrisy of them that speak lies, having their conscience seared with an hot-iron,</hi> &amp;c. as any one that understands Syntax must needs acknowledge: for <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>There cannot be a better Gloss upon the first part of this Prediction then what <hi>Epiphanius</hi> has occasionally wrote upon it in his sharp reproof of the <hi>Collyridians,</hi> who gave Divine worship to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> offering up a Cake or Cracknell to her. They did <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>. Which last words do plainly import that this Apostasy here is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of giving religious worship to <hi>Daemons,</hi> that is to say, to the <hi>Souls of men deceased:</hi> And it is observable that <hi>Chrysostom</hi> and <hi>Theophylact</hi> read <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p n="10">10. And that they do belong to the Reign of Antichrist even in our sense, Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> has, in my judgment, most convincingly made good even from those numbers of 1290 days and 1335, days in his little Treatise of those Numbers, which he calls <hi>Revelatio Antichristi.</hi> Which were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly given as a Key to open the truth of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Prophecies concerning the reign of that Man of sin, and the time of his Discovery. <hi>The words</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Dan. 12. 9.</note>

                        <p>The first of these Numbers from that <hi>Epocha</hi> ends in the year of our Lord 1120, the latter in the year 1165. (For I have already so undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly demonstrated that <hi>Days, stylo Prophetico,</hi> do signifie <hi>Years,</hi> both in this Treatise and in my <note n="*" place="margin">Book 5. Ch. 15. Sect. 2.</note> 
                           <hi>Mystery of Godliness,</hi> that I think no man will doubt of it; and that they cannot signifie <hi>Days</hi> here, Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> has with no less evidence evinced.) Now the Event is exact to Admiration. For in the year 1120 a true and perfect detection or description of Antichrist came forth, and not till then, as you may see by that compendious account which Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> has given thereof.</p>
                        <p>The ending of the other Period is also notable for the <hi>Waldenses</hi> and <hi>Albigenses,</hi> in whose times the <hi>Mystery of Iniquity</hi> was more fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected,
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:42932:216"/>
and by more numerous Companies protested against. Whence they are said to be <hi>blessed</hi> that reach to those times, by reason of the great clearness of the Light of the Gospel that shined forth: nor less happy they that then also suffered for witnessing to it; but certainly much more blessed by reason that their Reward should be greater and more singular. For the Prophecie declares how things are in truth and reality, and not according to the judgment or sentiments of the soft and false carnal mind. See that judicious Author Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> for I cannot dwell upon these things.</p>
                        <p>I will onely adde, for a farther assurance of Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s Exposition, that no other will hold water. For it is not likely that <hi>these Numbers of Days</hi> should be any Interpretation of the Extent of the above-mentioned <hi>Time and Times and half a Time;</hi> they both of them varying from the just measure of that Period, and the sense also of that Aenigmatical expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being not so hard but that all hit on it and agree in it. To which you may adde, that the <hi>Epocha</hi> from <hi>Antiochus</hi> will not comply with this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, (and it is hard to make that <hi>Epocha</hi> signifie otherwise then literally with any credibility of meaning:) As also, that this way the main difficulty about which <hi>Daniel</hi> was so solicitous will not be satisfi'd, which was, <hi>When this time of the End would be,</hi> not of what extent it was. Unto the course of which, I mean of these <gap reason="foreign">

The Angel tells <hi>Daniel, The words shall be sealed till the time of the End:</hi> and Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> shews plainly how the matter is revealed in this time of the End, and even in those very points of this Time which these Numbers direct to; which is worth our consideration and admiration.</p>

                        <p>Wherefore <hi>Calvin</hi> has judiciously adventured to interpret these verses of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, which immediately succeeded the <hi>Greek,</hi> (in the last times whereof <hi>Antiochus</hi> is said to reign, according to the Prophecie of <hi>Daniel)</hi> though he has over-rashly on the other side rejected the opinion of the Ancients, who suspected <hi>Antichrist</hi> concerned in these verses.

                        </argument>
                        <p n="1">1. IN the mean time we have, I hope, with sufficient copiousness vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Divine Providence from the least suspicion of so remarkable a neglect or defect, as not to have as well predicted as fore-seen this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Lapse of the Church in this first and chiefest point of Antichristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anism, <hi>Daemon-worship</hi> or <hi>Idolatry.</hi> Wherein I have been the more copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, it being the chief Characteristick of the Apostatized state of the Church, and indeed the Root of most of the rest of those Antichristian Enormities that have crept upon Christendome, I am sure of that which is at least next in hainousness, the <hi>Bloudy Persecution</hi> of the dear Children of God and faithful Members of Christ <hi>Jesus,</hi> who cannot submit to such Idolatrous practices.</p>
                        <p>But I shall return into my first Method, and search out the Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of each part of <hi>Antichristianism</hi> in that order I have spoken of them already. Which I shall be able to doe with greater brevity by far, having already made good my main design, and having nothing else to doe but to refer to many of those Prophecies which I have expounded already. Not to adde also how most of those parts of Antichristianism which are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind are nothing so fully and frequently predicted as this of Idolatry.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. As it fares with the very next Member we are to consider, which is that <hi>Spiritual Bondage and Slavery men are brought under by that burthen of Superstitious Opinions and of tedious and fruitless Observances, and a false persuasion of Penances to be done, not for emendation of life onely, but for satisfaction;</hi> as if the Bloud of the Son of God were of no price nor value: whenas such Fictions are forged for no other end then to uphold the Tyrannical power, or to advance the unjust gains of the Priest.</p>
                        <p>At which condition of the Church I do not doubt but the Spirit of God points, <hi>Apocal.</hi> 11. where <hi>the dead bodies of the Two Witnesses</hi> are said <hi>to lie in the streets of the great City, which spiritually is called</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Aegypt, <hi>where also our Lord was crucified.</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, that is, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="399" facs="tcp:42932:220"/>
acknowledges. I say therefore that this <hi>Great City,</hi> which is this My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical <hi>Aegypt,</hi> that House of Bondage to the ancient Church of God in the Type, and to the modern in the Antitype, is the pretended Catholick Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and that this Spiritual Slavery under the superstitious Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions of the Pope, and of whatsoever other Clergy of the same stamp, is glanced at in this passage of the Vision.</p>
                        <p>For the <hi>Two Witnesses</hi> being Synchronal to the <hi>restored Beast,</hi> it is in vain to dream of any thing at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> that should be the fulfilling of this Prophecy. It is therefore, I say, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> that is this Mystical <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and the Pope the <hi>Pharaoh</hi> of this <hi>Aegypt,</hi> with his hard Task-masters, that make the deluded people drudge and toil under the burthens of their Superstition. And the overthrow of this Spiritual <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Ecclesiastick Host is manifestly typified by that of the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi> in the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> which answers to the <hi>Bloud of Christ,</hi> which is a wall on the left hand and on the right to the simple-hearted <hi>Israelites</hi> in their flight from these Tyrants of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> but overwhelms <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Host, and puts this Song of Thanksgiving into the mouths of those who, through serious meditation upon the proper virtue and intent of the bloudy Passion of Christ, have escaped this <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Vassalage; <hi>I will sing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider has he thrown into the Sea:</hi> Or, which is the same, that <hi>Song of Moses and of the Lamb,</hi> Apoc. 15. <hi>Great and marvellous are thy Works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy waies, O King of Saints,</hi> &amp;c. But of these things I have spoken already, and therefore this brief intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">Book 1. Ch 4. Sect. 5.</note> shall suffice.</p>
                        <p>Onely for a corroboration of this Typical sense of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> I cannot omit to take notice how this Song of <hi>Moses</hi> and of the <hi>Lamb</hi> is said to be sung <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>. Which is a notorious Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation <note place="margin">Apocal. 15. 2.</note> that the escape of the <hi>Israelites</hi> from <hi>Pharaoh</hi> through the <hi>Red Sea</hi> is alluded to in this Song; both in that the Sea upon whose shore it is sung is called a <hi>Sea of Glass,</hi> which represents the hard consistency which the Sea then seemed to have, being as a thick glassy wall on this side and that side of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> (nay indeed it is said in the Song of <hi>Moses,</hi> (Exod. 15. 8.) <hi>The flouds stood upright as an heap, and the depths were congealed in the heart of the Sea;)</hi> and also in that it is said to be <hi>mixt with fire,</hi> which intimates how these two massy walls of glass were penetrated by the sight of the Angel that went along with the <hi>Israelites</hi> through the <hi>Red Sea</hi> by Night. The Name or Colour also of the Sea may not unlikely be alluded to in this Description, <hi>Red</hi> being not an improper Epithet of <hi>Fire.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There may be also still a more Mystical meaning of this <hi>Sea mingled with fire,</hi> (the Spirit with the Bloud of Christ) which for brevity sake I pass over, and will onely adde a short Paraphrase upon the verse I first cited.</p>

But the thing that we note now especially is their being called <hi>Aegypt</hi> for keeping the People of God in such Spiritual Slavery and Bondage.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Which Slavery and Vassallage we may conceive also to be glanced at in the figure of the <hi>Whore of Babylon that rides upon the Beast.</hi> For that this Imperious Clergy of <hi>Rome</hi> is so called, seems not onely for that <hi>Babylon</hi> looks like the first Precedent of Idolatry in worshipping <hi>Belus,</hi> but for their Tyrannical Pride and holding the people in such a forcible Captivity, from under which no man might withdraw himself and make back toward <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and the true Temple of God, but he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed himself to the Cruelty of this <hi>bloudy Whore, that sits as a Queen and saies she shall never see sorrow.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Beast</hi> also being said to be <hi>rid by the Whore</hi> insinuates a kinde of beastly droyling and slavery the Christian Empire has groaned under for so many Ages. Which, that it might be more like a Beast, (an Horse or Mule that has no understanding) they endeavoured to keep as ignorant as they could, that the People might be the more patiently <hi>Priest-rid,</hi> as the phrase is, and carry their Riders with more ease and safety.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. These are the chiefest strictures that do occurre to my minde in the Prophetick Visions that are applicable to this second member of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christianism, and that onely in this general way. That of S. <hi>Paul</hi> is more particular, <hi>Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats;</hi> but so easie to be understood, that the naming thereof is sufficient. And therefore I shall pass to the next branches of Antichristianism, those Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions that would run down the <hi>Sacred Offices of Christ,</hi> as he is <hi>King, Prophet</hi> and <hi>Priest.</hi> The grand Injury against the last of which is this, The making other Mediatours besides Christ, and giving them Religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, (which is predicted in S. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> in those places we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready produced and expounded, touching the <hi>Daemons</hi> or <hi>Mauzzim;)</hi> or else the suppressing or slighting the chief use of the Death of Christ, which is a comfortable ease of Conscience from all suspicion of God's dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure, or fear of punishment in the other world for want of satisfaction for our misdeeds here, so long as we have repented of them sincerely, and have amended our lives according to the word of Christ. Which abuse is one grand piece of that Slavery and Bondage that the People of God are held under in this Spiritual <hi>Aegypt;</hi> and therefore is generally prefigured in that Type we have already explamed, and also in the <hi>Whore of Babylon,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what we have above intimated. So that we may pass over this Office of Christ, and proceed to his <hi>Kingly</hi> and <hi>Prophetick Office.</hi>

The Opposition to the latter whereof is plainly predicted in the mention of the <hi>False-Prophet</hi> in the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> which is the same with the <hi>Two-horned Beast,</hi> who is the Restorer of the wounded Beast, (that is, of the Pagan Empire become Christian) into a new kinde of Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism, and is said <hi>to work Miracles in the sight of the Beast, wherewith he deceived them that dwell on the Earth, and made them worship the Image of the Beast and receive the Mark of the Beast,</hi> &amp;c. Chap. 13. Which things are so plainly said of the False-Prophet, Chap. 19. 20. that there can be no doubt but the <hi>Two-horned Beast</hi> and the <hi>False-Prophet</hi> are the same. <hi>And the Beast was taken, and with him the False-Prophet</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>Wherefore it is plain that the <hi>False-Prophet</hi> and the <hi>Two-horned Beast,</hi> and consequently <hi>the Whore of Babylon,</hi> are all one, as I have above no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and that therefore the <hi>Roman</hi> Idolatrous Clergy, that pretend to be such an infallible Church, as if God did unfailingly inspire them in what-ever is concluded upon by their Pope, or at least by him together with what they will call a <hi>General Council,</hi> are figured out here, by way of reproach to this boast of <hi>infallible Inspiration,</hi> in this Title or Style of <hi>Prophet.</hi> But for that they delude the world by false Doctrines, and either Diabolical Miracles or cunning Cheats and Forgeries of Miraculous Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, the same Company of men is more ignominiously and openly bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for this Impiety by the prefixing that deserved Epithet of <hi>False,</hi>

                           </gap>, <hi>The False-Prophet.</hi> What can be more plain then this? Or what a more wicked Opposition to the <hi>Prophetick</hi> Office of Christ, then for one to take upon him to be his infallible Vicar-General of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome, and yet to fill the world with Idolatry and Lies? Which this Body of Pseudo-prophets have done in some measure, more or less, for about these 1200 years, as is manifest from the last Consectary of our Joint-Exposition.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Whence we may be sure that the true Prophets, who speak accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the tenour of Apostolick Doctrine, would have but a sad time of it, and the <hi>Prophetick</hi> Office of Christ, as he illuminates these by his Word and Spirit, be opposed and resisted, nay these Instruments of his contradicted and oppressed with all imaginable injury and violence, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly as this <hi>Mystery of Iniquity</hi> should grow up in the Church; which seems to have commenced about 400 years after Christ.</p>
                        <p>Which Condition of the Church I conceive is prefigured in the Vision of the <hi>Two Witnesses,</hi> whose mournful Prophecy in Sackcloth is Synchro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal to the Reign of the False-Prophet, as has been above demonstrated. But the Description of things is such as comprises the Opposition to the <hi>Kingly</hi> Office of Christ as well as <hi>Prophetical,</hi> as shall appear in our Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Vision. For for any one to take upon him to be the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Interpreter of the Law of a King, is to give Laws for him, and to despoil him of his Throne and Sceptre. Or by what-ever other Device his Laws may be suppressed and kept from the People and other Laws put in their room, this <hi>Kingly</hi> Office is plainly made nothing by it. But that the Word of God contained in the Old and New Testament is thus dealt withall by this <hi>False-Prophet,</hi> I have in my <hi>Idea of Antichristianism</hi> suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently declared.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p n="1">1. LET us now enquire what news of these Injuries in this Vision of the <hi>Two mournful Witnesses;</hi> who complain not without a cause, as well the <hi>Regal</hi> as <hi>Prophetick</hi> Office of Christ being so palpably opposed by that <hi>Man of sin.</hi> We shall give a brief Explication of the Vision, proceeding orderly from verse to verse, beginning at the third, and holding on till the fourteenth, where the story of the <hi>Witnesses</hi> endeth.</p>
                        <p>Ver. III. <hi>And I will give unto my two Witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and three score daies in Sack-cloth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That these <hi>Daies</hi> are so many <hi>Years,</hi> appears from the last Consectary of my Joint-Exposition. That these Witnesses are <hi>Two,</hi> is partly from the Types they allude to in the Old Testament, and partly from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the things they signifie. The <hi>Types</hi> they allude to are <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron, Elias</hi> and <hi>Elisha, Zerobabel</hi> and <hi>Jesua,</hi> three several Pairs of holy men that are famous for their conduct of the People in such times as bear also analogy to these of the <hi>Two Witnesses,</hi> whose Prophecy is during the Conculcation of the <hi>Outward Court</hi> of the Temple by the Gentiles, that is, while it is polluted with Idolatry, as <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> were over the <hi>Israelites</hi> in the Wilderness, where they often lapsed into <hi>Idolatry,</hi> (to which the <hi>Woman in the Wilderness</hi> may haply allude,) <hi>Elias</hi> and <hi>Elisha</hi> in their <hi>Baalitical</hi> Apostasy, and <hi>Zerobabel</hi> and <hi>Jesua</hi> when they were yet in the Captivity of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There are also three Pair of things that may be fitly signified by these <hi>Two Witnesses.</hi> Either the suppressed <hi>Magistracy</hi> and <hi>Ministry,</hi> (such I mean as answer in opposition to the <hi>Ten-borned Beast</hi> and <hi>False-Prophet,</hi> and bear a resemblance with <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron, Zerobabel</hi> and <hi>Jesua;)</hi> or else the <hi>People of the Jews,</hi> (I mean such of them as are so sincere, that, were it not for the sway of <hi>Antichristianism</hi> in the world, would be converted to Christ) together with the <hi>Virgin-company of Christians;</hi> or lastly, (which answers to these two last Witnesses) the <hi>Old Testament</hi> and <hi>the New,</hi> which may be added by an <hi>Henopoeia</hi> to the other.</p>
                        <p>Ver. IV. <hi>These are the two Olive-trees, and the two Candlesticks stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding before the God of the Earth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="404" facs="tcp:42932:223"/>
It is a plain <hi>Israelism,</hi> alluding to that in <hi>Zachary,</hi> Chap. 4. 11. <hi>What are these two Olive-trees upon the right sight of the Candlestick and upon the left side thereof?</hi> And then ver. 14. <hi>These are the two Anointed ones, that stood by the Lord of the whole Earth.</hi> Which Interpreters uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally understand of <hi>Zerobabel</hi> and <hi>Jesua.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Ver. V. <hi>And if any one will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth and devoureth their enemies; and if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is an Allusion to the story of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> their bringing down fire upon their Opposers. But here it is to be understood more Mystically of the Fire of the Spirit, or of the Law of God proceeding out of their mouths, whereby they convince the world. <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. <hi>Is not my word like as fire, saith the Lord, and like an hammer that breaks a rock in pieces?</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Ver. 19</note> Like that of the man out of the Sea, 2 <hi>Esdras</hi> 13. <hi>whose voice whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it went out of his mouth, all they burnt that heard it.</hi> And again in <note place="margin">Ver. 4.</note> the same Chapter, <hi>And lo, as he saw the violence of the multitude that</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Ver. 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.</note> 
                           <hi>came, he neither lift up his hand, nor held sword nor any instrument of war: But onely I saw that he sent out of his mouth as it had been a blast of fire, and out of his lips a flaming breath, and out of his tongue he cast out sparks and tempests. And they were all mixt together, the blast of fire, the flaming breath and the great tempest, and fell with violence on the great multitude which was prepared to fight, and burnt them up every one; so that of a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of an innumerable multitude nothing was to be perceived but onely dust and smell of smoke.</hi> Which is afterwards interpreted, ver. 38. <hi>And he shall destroy them without labour by the Law which is like unto Fire.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>By this we may know what is meant by <hi>[If any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed.]</hi> And it was the word of the Lord to <hi>Zero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babel,</hi> who is alluded to in these Witnesses, <hi>Not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of Hosts.</hi> So plain is it that the weapons <note place="margin">Zechar. 4. 6.</note> of the <hi>Two Witnesses</hi> in the time of their mournful Prophecy are onely Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual. Which is a thing worthy the noting and seriously considering.</p>
                        <p>Ver. VI. <hi>These have power to shut Heaven, that it rain not in the daies of their Prophecy; and have power over waters to turn them into bloud, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they please.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>In the days of their Prophecy,</hi> that is to say, of their mournfull Prophecy, or in the days of their prophesying in sackcloth; as is plainly to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood out of the third verse. It is a manifest Allusion to <hi>Elias</hi> his hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering it from raining in <hi>Ahab</hi>'s time for three years and six months, which is exactly the time of the Prophecy of these Witnesses, namely, 1260 days. But the meaning must needs be more mysticall, these <hi>days</hi> signifying <hi>years.</hi> Wherefore by <hi>Rain</hi> is meant the distilling of that pure refreshing Doctrine of the Gospel unadulterated by the false Glosses of men; which Heavenly drops descend not during the mournfull Prophecy of the Witnesses. But this <hi>shutting up Heaven</hi> thus is ascribed to them, not that they positively hinder the descent of this celestial dew, but by a <hi>Metalepsis,</hi> such as I have already observed in the <hi>Rider of the red Horse,</hi> to whom power is said to be given <hi>to take peace from the Earth,</hi> and that <note place="margin">Apocal. 6. 4.</note> 
                           <hi>there was given unto him a great sword,</hi> whenas yet there is no more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:42932:223"/>
by it, then that in his time there would be much killing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So that the Effect is put upon the Sign, when such a thing should be: as in that vulgar verse,
<q>
                              <l>Pallida Luna pluit, rubicunda flat, alba serenat.</l>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. This is one warrantable sense; and yet there is still a better, If this <hi>shutting up of Heaven</hi> be attributed unto these two mournfull Witnesses not by a bare <hi>Metalepsis</hi> onely, but by a <hi>Zoopoeia</hi> of the second sort, such as I have above described; wherein, though the party to whom the Effects be attributed does not use any activity to produce them, yet in some sense he has a causal Influence upon them; as the absent Sun may be said to be the cause of Night and of all the Villainies committed under her shelter. So the suppression and putting out of place these Witnesses is the cause of the <hi>shutting up of Heaven,</hi> and of the scarcity of the pure Word amongst the people; but cannot be attributed to the <hi>Witnesses</hi> themselves, but onely by a <hi>Metalepsis,</hi> or rather a <hi>Zoopoeia.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. According to which <hi>the turning water into bloud</hi> and the <hi>smiting the Earth with all plagues as often as they please,</hi> is attributed to them, namely by a <hi>Zoopoeia,</hi> though they have no positive activity therein, no more then the Sun in all the Murthers and Adulteries that are committed by his absence in the covert and concealment of the shady Night. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whereas it is added, <hi>as often as they will,</hi> it is but the height and subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of this Scheme, and signifies no more then, <hi>as often as opportunities are offered for such effects,</hi> upon which the mournfull condition of these <hi>Witnesses</hi> have a consequentiall Influence, though not an active. And <hi>Will</hi> is attributed to them with as much reason and elegancy as the <hi>Activity</hi> it self; and indeed according to necessary Analogie, those occasional Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences answering exactly to the occasional exertions of the Acts of the Will in him that is said properly to act, and not by a <hi>Zoopoeia.</hi> The Allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is to <hi>Moses</hi> his smiting the Land of <hi>Aegypt</hi> with those ten Plagues: The inflicting of which, in a Mystery, is ascribed to these <hi>two Witnesses</hi> while they are in this debased and dejected plight.</p>
                        <p>The sense therefore in brief is this: That the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> in which is this Spiritual <hi>Aegypt</hi> that holds the people of God in bondage, whether the Waters thereof be turned into Bloud by intestine warrs and broils; or whether it no somely abound with Frogs, that is, with slimy, salacious, and venereous persons; or be full of lazy and Lousy beggars, a sordid and squalid poverty over-running the generality of men by reason of either the Oppression or ill Discipline of them that are in Power; or men be infested and disquieted with the importunate Incursions of swarms of Gnats and Flies, that is to say, with the Numerosity of Superstitious Scrupulosities and vexatious Controversies of Polemical Theologie, that sting and bite and disturb the minds and consciences of men to no purpose but for afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and inquietude; or the Beasts, which the <hi>Platonists</hi> call our Bodies, be plagued with Murrain, that is, be charged with foulness and corruption and with the noisom poison of the deadly sins; or that the Multitude be unquiet, as if enraged with angry Boils and Ulcers; or the barbarous Nations from the North invade the Empire like a violent storm of Hail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stones, or the <hi>Turk</hi> and <hi>Saracen</hi> from the South, as a numerous army of
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:42932:224"/>
Locusts; or that palpable Darkness in Divine matters seize the minds of men; or that the First-born in every Family be found dead, that is (saith <hi>Alcazar)</hi> the Soul of every man obnoxious to eternal Death, (as if he would not have the Soul <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>born later then the Body,</hi> but to be the first born in man; or rather because she has the right of Primo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniture, the right of Ruling over the Body:) That all these <hi>Plagues of the Mystical Aegypt,</hi> what-ever they be, (as certainly they cannot signify well) are attributed to the two mournfull <hi>Witnesses</hi> by a <hi>Zoopoeia,</hi> they being the necessary Consequence of the <hi>Witnesses</hi> Disgrace, Affliction, and Deprivation of Power and Office, as Darkness, Thefts, Murthers and Adulteries are of the Absence of the Sun.</p>
                        <p>Ver. VII. <hi>And when they shall have finished their Testimony, the Beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them and kill them.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Greek has it, <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap> which signifies no more then, <hi>when they shall perform their Witnessings.</hi> And <hi>[out of the bottomless pit]</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, which is either, <hi>Out of a deep pit in the Earth,</hi> or <hi>Out of the Sea,</hi> and so may intimate either the <hi>Two-horned Beast,</hi> or the <hi>Ten-horned.</hi> The making war against them, by a <hi>Diorismus,</hi> signifies any manner of opposing them, and endeavour to suppress them, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding war and bloud-shed; as it happens to them toward the latter end of their Prophecy, among the <hi>Waldenses</hi> and <hi>Albigenses</hi> and others. And as <hi>War</hi> signifies any Opposition, so <hi>Death</hi> or <hi>Killing</hi> any changing their condition into worse, so that they cease to be what they were before. And that this is a <hi>Political Death</hi> or putting out of Power is plain, in that their <hi>Resurrection</hi> is such. See <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Resurrection</hi> in my <hi>Prophetick Alphabet.</hi> So that the sense is this, That no sooner shall they begin to perform their office of witnessing to the Truth, but they shall be assaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, suppressed, and politically killed, that is, kept out of power.</p>
                        <p>Ver. VIII. <hi>And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great City that Spiritually is called Sodom and Aegypt, where also our Lord was crucified.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This verse I have expounded already; onely you may here take notice how well this Appellation of <hi>Aegypt</hi> agrees with the mention of the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian</hi> Plagues before alluded to, which abode upon the Land because they still kept the People of God in bondage, and would not suffer them to serve God according to his own will and precept.</p>
                        <p>Ver. IX. <hi>And they of the People and Kindreds and Tongues and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions shall see their dead bodies three days and an half, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in the grave.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This <hi>not being buried</hi> has a double sense, as you may see in the <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Alphabet.</hi> But I must confess I take the more favourable to be the truer, and that their <hi>not being buried</hi> is a pledge of their Resurrection at last, that is, <hi>after three days and an half,</hi> which I have in my <hi>Mystery of</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Book 5. Ch. 15. Sect. 4.</note> 
                           <hi>Godliness</hi> shewn to be <hi>Three Times and an half,</hi> or 1260 years; the very same with the time of their mournfull Prophecy. For they being onely <hi>Politically</hi> dead, it is not at all inconsistent in the verity of the thing sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified that they should prophesy in a mournfull condition, nay indeed it
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:42932:224"/>
is necessary to be so. And the Spirit of God designing the setting out these two parts of their condition, namely their Prophetical Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings and their Devestment of all Political Power, (which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture calls <hi>the Death of a people,</hi> and their Recovery again into a Polity their <hi>Resurrection,)</hi> he has (partly because it were very incongruous to make them prophesy while they were dead, and partly because so long a time as their Prophecy is said to last, viz. 1260 years, was not so sutable for a dead body to lie unburied in the streets and then to revive) so contrived the <hi>Cortex</hi> of this Vision with such admirable artifice, as that these harsh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses are avoided in that <hi>Homonymia</hi> of <hi>Three days and an half,</hi> and all the parts of the Prophetick Figurations made to keep due proportion and symmetry, as well as the inward signification of the things meant; and yet without any prejudice to the finding out of the true meaning to him that is sagacious, the <hi>Three days and an half</hi> so easily casting him upon <hi>Three times and an half,</hi> which is the very same time with 1260 days. But whether in a secondary Intention these <hi>Three days and an half</hi> may have some such meaning as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> has given them, Event will best define.

                        <p>Ver. 12. <hi>And they heard a voice from Heaven saying unto them, Come up hither. And they ascended up to Heaven in a cloud, and their enemies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held them.</hi>

<pb n="408" facs="tcp:42932:225"/>
Dignities. For it is not true of this Political Heaven, but of the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>And that these Witnesses are said <hi>to ascend up to Heaven in a cloud,</hi> it seems an Allusion to Christ's Ascension after his Crucifixion, which is also alluded to here in the eighth verse. And the time of Christ's mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Prophecy before his Resurrection was about <hi>Three years and an half,</hi> (if we may believe Chronologers) to make the Allusion still more perfect.</p>
                        <p>Ver. XIII. <hi>And the same time there was a great Earth-quake, and the tenth part of the City fell; and in the Earth-quake were slain seven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Names of men: and the Remnant were affrighted and gave glory to the God of Heaven.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That an <hi>Earth-quake</hi> signifies Political Commotions and change of affairs, is obvious to any one to note. But that the <hi>City</hi> here mentioned should be understood not of a City of brick or stone, but a <hi>Polity,</hi> has not been so easy for every one to hit on. But I conceive it is plain enough that this City is the very City mentioned in the eighth verse, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>great City,</hi> and <hi>this great City</hi> is the <hi>Whore of Babylon,</hi> and the <hi>Whore of Babylon</hi> is nothing but the body of the Idolatrous Clergy in the Empire, who appertain to the <hi>seventh</hi> or <hi>last Head</hi> of the Beast, which is an <hi>Head of Blasphemie</hi> as well as the six first, that is to say, an <hi>Idolatrous Head.</hi> Whence we may understand what is meant by these <hi>Seven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Names of men:</hi> For neither <hi>seven</hi> nor <hi>thousand</hi> signify any deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate number, (though by a pleasant <hi>Diorismus</hi> they seem to doe so) but onely the nature or property of those <hi>Names of men</hi> that are said to be slain, namely, That they are Titles, Dignities, Offices or Orders of men belonging to the State of Christendom as under the Seventh Head that is become Idolatrous and Antichristian. And in that this Number <hi>Seven</hi> is multiplied into a Thousand, it signifies a perfect and durable nulling all such Offices and Orders of men. Which if Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> had taken notice of, it would have saved him the labour of making out the sense of <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, and also the solicitude touching the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionableness of the Number of the slain. For no men at all here are necessarily implied to be <hi>slain,</hi> but onely all Antichristian Offices and Fraternities to be dissolved and abrogated, and things to be reduced to the purity of the first four hundred years. For <hi>to slay,</hi> by a <hi>Diorismus,</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies nothing else but a causing a thing to cease to be. This I little que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion but is the true meaning of this place. And <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>But that there is any design upon the brick and stone, the walls and buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of <hi>Rome,</hi> either in this present Vision or any other in the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> I do profess my self for the present so dim-sighted as not to discover; the <hi>Papal Polity,</hi> by an <hi>Hylasmus,</hi> not the material City, being understood in all the denunciations against her, so far as I see yet. So that if she be to be burnt, or sack'd, or sunk by Earth-quakes, it may be but a By-Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and not directly pointed at nor prefigured in the <hi>Apocalyptick</hi> Visions. But if such a thing should happen in such circumstances as should
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:42932:225"/>
in a special and peculiar way fit with some of these Prophecies, it will be therein comprised by an <hi>Henopoeia</hi> of the second sort, as I have intimated in my <hi>Prophetick Schemes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But be this how it will, I make no question but this thirteenth verse of the Chapter we are upon concerns mainly, if not onely, the Idolatrous Clergy it self. But it is said of <hi>the rest,</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, (not <hi>the remnant)</hi> that they were indeed <hi>affrighted</hi> and amazed, but <hi>gave glory to the God of Heaven,</hi> as being just in his judgments.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Out of what I have written here and in my <hi>Mystery of Godliness,</hi> I think it is evident enough that that Antichristian Opposition that is made <note place="margin">Book 5. Ch. 17. Sect. 8.</note> against the <hi>Prophetick</hi> and <hi>Regal</hi> Office of Christ is clearly prefigured in this Vision of the <hi>Two Witnesses,</hi> who are said <hi>to lie slain in the street of the great City</hi> during the Conculcation of the Outward Court of the Temple by the Gentiles.</p>
                        <p>And truly though some please themselves in conceiting this Vision such an invincible puzzle, I cannot but prosess that the fense thereof seems to me as clear as the Meridian Sun. And for that special Knot therein, imagined to lie in the eighth verse, how these <hi>Witnesses</hi> can be understood of Christendom, their bodies being said to lie dead in <hi>the City where our Lord was crucified,</hi> which must be <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> I have already intimated that this City is called the old <hi>Jerusalem</hi> spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually or mystically, as well as <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Aegypt.</hi> And if any one have an heart to hear, (for it requires no great labour of the head to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it) the brief and plain sense of this verse is this: That these <hi>Two Witnesses</hi> shall lie despoiled of all Respect and Power in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts of the Jurisdiction of that Church which hitherto has always been the greatest, and is now very large indeed, consisting of mere formal, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and Hypocritical Professours of the worship of the true God, in which Church <hi>our Lord also was crucified.</hi> What can be more easy and plain then this? For it onely supposes that this carnal, Hypocritical, Witness-slaying Church of the Christians is one succeeding City, Synagogue or false Church with the formal, Hypocritical, Prophet-murthering Church of the Jews. Which is a plain truth, whether this Prophecy suppose it or no. But we proceed.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p n="1">1. THat Prophecy also in <hi>Daniel</hi> of the <hi>little Horn</hi> that is said <hi>to change times and laws</hi> is an express Prediction of that Antichristian Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition which is against the <hi>Regal</hi> Office of Christ. For that this <hi>little Horn</hi> is the same with the <hi>Two-horned Beast</hi> or <hi>the Whore</hi> in the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> I think no man will scruple that considers that this Horn is part of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Kingdom which is decyphered by <hi>Ten Horns,</hi> and that it belongs to that time when the Kingdom is actually <hi>Ten-horned;</hi> which is not in succession, but together; as the <hi>Ten toes</hi> of the Statue, which answer to these <hi>Ten horns,</hi> do not signify the succession of Ten Kings, but Ten Kings ranked in the same time, as the Toes of the feet of the Image, which have not properly a precedency, but rather a co-ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Site.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Now that the <hi>Fourth Kingdom</hi> which is prefigured by the <hi>iron leggs, feet and ten toes of the Image,</hi> and by the Beast with Iron teeth and ten <note place="margin">Dan. 2.</note> Horns, is not that of the <hi>Lagidae</hi> and <hi>Seleucidae,</hi> as <hi>Grotius</hi> would have it, but the Kingdom of the <hi>Romans,</hi> there are these weighty Reasons to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us.</p>
                        <p>First, It is the universal sense of all Ecclesiastick Writers, <hi>That the Fourth Beast is the Roman Empire;</hi> as both <hi>Cornelius à Lapide</hi> and <hi>Caspar Sanctius,</hi> both of them Jesuites, yet do roundly assort. The words of the latter are these: <hi>Est ergò omnium sententiâ innominata has atque <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                           <pb n="411" facs="tcp:42932:227"/>
3. Secondly, That it cannot be the Kingdom of the <hi>Lagidae</hi> and <hi>Seleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidae,</hi> as <hi>Grotius</hi> would bear us in hand, (in which odd conceit of his he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sakes the judgment of the whole Church of Christ, to follow <hi>Porphyrius</hi> his, who was a sworn Enemie to the Christian Religion) appears from what is said <hi>Daniel</hi> 7. 23. <hi>The Fourth Beast shall be the Fourth King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom upon Earth,</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>Quod majus erit omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus regnis, Which shall be greater then all Kingdoms;</hi> so the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Latine and <hi>Vatablus.</hi> The Seventy also render it, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>. And it agrees best with what follows, <hi>and shall devour the whole Earth,</hi> (which must be understood in such a sense as Earth was before) <hi>and shall tread it down and break it in pieces.</hi> Which it could not be said to doe, unless it were so great a Kingdom as is here intimated. Now it is manifest that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the <hi>Seleucidae</hi> and <hi>Lagidae</hi> was neither greater, more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, nor a more victorious Kingdom then any of the three prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, namely, the <hi>Babylonian, Persian,</hi> and that of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, from whose Kingdom they would make this of the <hi>Seleucidae</hi> and <hi>Lagidae</hi> distinct. Wherefore their Kingdom cannot be this Fourth.</p>
                        <p>This Inference is so plain to <hi>Gaspar Sanctius,</hi> that he does, though but justly, yet very severely, chastise <hi>Porphyrius</hi> for this errour which <hi>Grotius</hi> has so unluckily taken up. For he breaks out into these words upon this Text, <hi>Vide</hi> Porphyrii <hi>stuporem &amp; oscitantiam, in cujus mentem venire potuit ut<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> existimaverit regnum eorum qui</hi> Alexandro <hi>successere omnium esse maximum, quódque omnem terram sibi subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerit conculcaveritque, cùm reliquis regnis longè fuerit infirmius, &amp; ab omnibus concisum aut malè vexatum.</hi> Nay, the very Prophecy it self makes the Kingdom of the Successours of <hi>Alexander</hi> less then his in power and greatness, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8. 22. where it is said that <hi>four Kingdoms shall stand up,</hi> but not in the power of <hi>Alexander:</hi> Which is, they shall be inferiour to him. Which questionless is meant of them joyntly, it being a needless intimation of them single.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Thirdly, The Kingdom of the <hi>Iron leggs and toes</hi> and of the <hi>Ten-horned Beast</hi> with <hi>iron teeth</hi> are one and the same Kingdom, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Grotius</hi> his own acknowledgment, which he makes that of the <hi>Seleucidae</hi> and <hi>Lagidae.</hi> Now it is said that a <hi>Stone cut out of a Mountain without hands should break in pieces these leggs and toes,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Dan. 2.</note> nay the whole Image of iron, brass, silver, and gold, and so suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed this Kingdom of the <hi>Seleucidae</hi> according to his sense of the Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And Chap. 7. <hi>One like the Son of man in the clouds of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven comes to receive a Kingdom,</hi> namely, upon the destruction of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus Epiphanes</hi> that <hi>little Horn</hi> amongst the ten in this fourth Kingdom of <hi>Grotius</hi> his framing, of whom it is said, at the 21. verse, <hi>I beheld, and the same Horn made warre with the Saints, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed against them, untill the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the Saints of the most High.</hi> Which is the same with the <hi>Son of man his coming in the clouds of Heaven, to receive the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
                           <pb n="412" facs="tcp:42932:228"/>
                           <hi>of the Ancient of days,</hi> ver. 13. And both agree with the <hi>Stone cut out without hands,</hi> to shew it is not the work of man, but of the Ancient of days, God himself; and that this is indeed the very King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Christ, as Interpreters ever have expounded it. Which is a perfect contradiction to <hi>Grotius</hi> his dream, That the Fourth Beast with iron teeth and the iron leggs of the Image denote the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the <hi>Lagidae</hi> and <hi>Seleucidae,</hi> and that <hi>Antiochus</hi> is this <hi>little Horn.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> was dead almost two hundred years before Christ so much as preached the Doctrine of the Kingdom, or had any Disciples to follow him; and yet it is said <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 44. <hi>And in the days of these Kingdoms shall the God of Heaven set up a Kingdom which shall never be destroyed.</hi> (From which passage I doubt not but that phrase <hi>[The Kingdom of God,]</hi> as also from that above <hi>[The Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven]</hi> does so often occurre in the Gospel; as also that Title which Christ so often gives himself of the <hi>Son of man.</hi> And <hi>Grotius</hi> himself upon <hi>Matthew</hi> Ch. 8. 20. acknowledgeth that <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                           <hi>the Son of man</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 13. is to be understood of the <hi>Messias.)</hi> Wherefore it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible that the Kingdom of the <hi>Lagidae</hi> and <hi>Seleucidae</hi> should be the <hi>Fourth</hi> Kingdom.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. But here <hi>Grotius,</hi> contrary to his judgment when he wrote upon <hi>Matthew,</hi> has found a device which is scarce to be uttered without horrour and astonishment. So that I am infinitely amazed, that a man other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise so learned and laudable, (as he speaks of <hi>Porphyrius)</hi> should be miss-led into so bad an adventure. <hi>The Son of man coming in the clouds of Heaven,</hi> according to him, is, <hi>Populus Romanus nullum intra se habens regem.</hi> When our Saviour Christ intimated to the high Priest that he was that <hi>Son of man that should come in the clouds of Heaven,</hi> it seem'd so high an Arrogation, that he rent his clothes and said <hi>he had spoken blasphemie.</hi> And truly I think that neither Jew nor Christian can well acquit <hi>Grotius</hi> of that crime, who attributes that which is the peculiar character of the <hi>Messias</hi> to a Prophane and Pagan people, and that forsooth because they had no King; as if they were ever the better for that. But they had Kings at first; and both in the Infancy of their Empire and afterwards they had a Supreme Power so great and imperial, as may excuse them from the least shew of Contempt. They had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways over them a Sovereignty, so that they could not be deemed <hi>the Son of man</hi> for any such private condition. For the <hi>Summa Potestas</hi> is the <hi>Summa Potestas</hi> under what name or form soever, and of the same real grandeur. Besides that they were a most glorious and victorious people before <hi>Antiochus</hi> his time. So that it is a very dilute and sapless conceit of <hi>Grotius</hi> to apply the phrase of <hi>the Son of man</hi> to them, for any inconsiderableness in them or obscurity: For they were not so in the times of <hi>Antiochus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">6. Again, the Kingdom of the <hi>Son of man</hi> and the <hi>Stone cut out without hands</hi> are all one, both in truth and according to <hi>Grotius</hi> his own Concession.

<pb n="413" facs="tcp:42932:228"/>
by the power and Spirit of God. That this is the meaning of <hi>[without hands]</hi> is the general vote of Interpreters, S. <hi>Jerom, Irenaus, Justin, Epiphanius,</hi> S. <hi>Augustin, Theodoret,</hi> and several others.</p>
                        <p>Where think you does <hi>Grotius</hi> take shelter now? Why, This Figure which is so appropriate to Christ, and mentioned of him so often in the New Testament, <hi>This Stone</hi> must be cast away, as if it were neither precious nor a Corner-stone, and be bestowed again on a Pagan peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the <hi>Romans.</hi> For so <hi>Grotius</hi> does not stick to profess, <hi>Idem Lapis &amp; Filius hominis;</hi> and he made <hi>the Son of man</hi> before the people of <hi>Rome.</hi> But can a man believe that the Original or Success of that people was <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, a thing brought to pass by the special power and Spirit of God, and not <hi>more humano,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the usual course of the World, and that not of the best kind, their beginnings being helped on by a rabble of Ruffians and Robbers?</p>
                        <p n="7">7. No, but that is not <hi>Grotius</hi> his gloss, you will say. Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hear what it is; <hi>Lapis abscissus de monte sine manibus,</hi> according to him, is <hi>Exercitus populi qui suae esset spontis nullique regi pareret; cujus populi origo à monte, nempe Palatino.</hi> In which there is nothing sound nor solid. For was this <hi>Roman</hi> Army any thing more <hi>suae spontis</hi> in that they had not a <hi>Kingly</hi> Government at <hi>Rome?</hi> That Supreme Power of <hi>Consuls</hi> and <hi>Senatours</hi> was as directive and coactive as if it had been <hi>Regal.</hi> So that the motion of this Army was never the more spontaneous for this. Again, The <hi>Stone cut from the mountain without hands</hi> implies that it was then spontaneously divided from the Mountain, when it is said to be <hi>cut</hi> thence: But when the <hi>Romans</hi> first issued from mount <hi>Palatine,</hi> yea so soon as they were <hi>populus Romanus, Regal</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was amongst them, it being the first Government of this People, and therefore they were not then <hi>Populus suae spontis,</hi> according to <hi>Grotius</hi> his Conceit, so that he cannot bring both ends together. And, lastly, To in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret <hi>Mountain</hi> here in a literal sense, is unskilfully done, and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the analogy of the Prophetick style, nor the very intimation of the present Text, which says the <hi>Little stone became a great Mountain itself, and filled the whole Earth.</hi> Wherefore this <hi>Mountain</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying not literally but politically, there is no question but the other does so too, and that the <hi>Stone</hi> is in some sense homogeneall to this rocky Mountain.</p>
                        <p>Whence the sense is plainly this: That out of the great Mountain, that is, the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, there should be a People raised, not by humane power or policy, but by the Spirit of God, and the preaching of the Gospel by <hi>Jesus</hi> Christ and his Apostles, which should be a peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to him, and become the Subjects of his Kingdom; that is to say, That the Church of Christ should be cut out of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire without humane help. This is a most easy and undistorted sense, and against which there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made the least Exception.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. Fourthly, which I have already intimated above, The <hi>Ten Horns</hi> of the Fourth Beast with iron teeth, and the <hi>Ten toes</hi> of the iron leggs of the <hi>Statue,</hi> signify the same thing. Wherefore it is plain,
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:42932:229"/>
sith the <hi>Ten toes</hi> imply a Coexistence of the <hi>Ten Horns,</hi> by reason of the coordination of their Site, that there must be Ten Kings together in the Fourth Kingdom. But in the Kingdom of the <hi>Seleucidae</hi> and <hi>Lagidae</hi> there were not Ten Kings together all at once. Therefore that Kingdom is not the Fourth.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. Fifthly, <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> part of this Kingdom of the <hi>Lagidae</hi> and <hi>Seleucidae,</hi> is said to <hi>rise up in the latter time of the Kingdom</hi> of the Successours of <hi>Alexander, Dan.</hi> 8. 22, 23. Wherefore this Kingdom of the <hi>Lagidae</hi> and <hi>Seleucidae</hi> has expired near two thousand years ago. But the Kingdom of the Fourth Beast reaches even to the Day of Judgment. <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 9, 10. <hi>And I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the ancient of days did sit—His throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire. A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him; thousand thousands ministred unto him, and ten thousand times ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand stood before him; the Judgment was set, and the Books were open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> &amp;c. That this is the Description of the <hi>Day of Judgment,</hi> is the general Opinion of both Christians and Jews, and answers exactly to the <hi>Lake of fire and the opening of the Books, Apocal.</hi> 20. which <hi>Grotius</hi> himself does interpret of the Last Day. Whence we may safely conclude that the Kingdom of the <hi>Lagidae</hi> and <hi>Seleucidae</hi> is not the <hi>Fourth Kingdom,</hi> as having ceased so long before that time, though we understood the <hi>Day of Judgment</hi> in the sense of the Rabbins <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>. According to which the meaning of <hi>[I beheld till the thrones were set—and the Books were opened]</hi> is this, That the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> had a prospect even to the utmost end of that great Day. But he begins more particularly at the beginning of that Day in the eleventh verse. But this I have onely noted by the bye.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. Sixthly and lastly, <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Kingdom and that of his Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours is all one Kingdom: But that of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s is the <hi>Third</hi> according to <hi>Grotius</hi> his own Concession. Now that that of his Successours (of which Line are the <hi>Lagidae</hi> and <hi>Seleucidae)</hi> is one Kingdom with that of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s, is evident out of <hi>Daniel,</hi> Ch. 8. 21. <hi>The rough Goat is the King of</hi> Graecia, <hi>and the great Horn that is betwixt his eyes is the first King. Now that being broken, whereas Four stood up for it, Four King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms shall stand up out of the Nation, but not in his power.</hi> This is one plain proof that the Kingdom of <hi>Alexander</hi> and his Successours is all one Kingdom. For he calls <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>first King,</hi> which necessarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies that his Successours are the second, and that therefore they all belong to one and the same Kingdom. Nay he says plainly, that <hi>these four Horns stand up for that great one,</hi> that is, in his stead. What is this but to succeed in place of him, as the Heads of one and the same Empire? For no new Beast is said to succeed this Beast, but the Horns the Horn. And then the comparing of them and saying, <hi>but not in his power,</hi> farther intimates a cognation and succession of one Line, and that he does not speak of the Heads of two different Kingdoms.</p>
                        <p>Which appears farther from vers. 8. <hi>Therefore the Goat waxed very great, and when he was strong, the great Horn was broken, and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of Heaven.</hi> But where should
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:42932:229"/>
these come up, but on that Head that had lost this great Horn, which is compensated with four lesser ones, though in their kinde notable? For it is very incongruous and extravagant to phansy them to come up in any other. And surely, if they had belonged to any other Beast, that Beast would not fail to have been named. Wherefore they must either grow out of this Goat's Head, or no where, unless out of the ground; which is ridiculous. And therefore it is plain, that <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Kingdome and that of his Successours is but one Kingdome. For that Goat is but one and the same Goat under the Succession of this variety of Horns.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. And yet there is still greater evidence of this truth from Ch. 7. 6. <hi>After which I beheld, and lo, another like a Leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the Beast had also four Heads, and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was given unto it.</hi> That the <hi>four Heads</hi> of this Beast are the four Successours of <hi>Alexander,</hi> namely, <hi>Perdicca, Seleucus, Ptolemaens, Mele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ager, Grotius</hi> himself does frankly confess. The <hi>Wings</hi> therefore denote the four Kingdomes <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Empire was divided into after his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cease; which is still look'd upon as one Beast notwithstanding, as the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> is with its division into Ten Kingdomes, noted by ten Horns, or into Oriental and Occidental, figured by the two Wings of an Eagle.</p>
                        <p>Here <hi>Grotius,</hi> if he would speak out, would make <hi>Alexander</hi> the Beast, as he has <hi>Domitian</hi> and others in the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> against all the Laws of Prophetick Interpretation, nay indeed against all rhyme and reason. For he glosses thus, <hi>Pardus varium Animal, sic</hi> Alexander <hi>moribus variis.</hi> But how grosly incongruous it is, let any one consider. For then would <hi>Alexander</hi> be inferiour to his four chief Officers, and they would be the Head of him, which is a Political Absurdity; nay the Head of him when he ceased to be, which is an Absurdity Metaphysical. Wherefore <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> is the first Head or great Horn of this Beast, not the Body of it, that he may be superiour to his four grand Officers; and not be the Beast to bear these four Horns or Heads when he has quite ceased to be on this stage of things. For these were not <hi>Heads,</hi> nor <hi>Horns,</hi> before he was dead. <hi>Alexander</hi> therefore is the first of the Succession of the Heads or Horns of this Beast, not the Beast it self.</p>
                        <p>But to come up closer to our business: I say, it is very manifest from these four Heads and four Wings that this <hi>Leopard</hi> is said to have, that the <hi>Third Kingdome</hi> takes into it the four first Successours of <hi>Alexander.</hi> Nothing can be more plain then this from the very Text. For the <hi>Leopard</hi> is described in the <hi>third place,</hi> and immediately after him the Fourth Beast is mentioned, and called the <hi>Fourth,</hi> v. 7. Wherefore this four-headed <hi>Leopard</hi> is plainly the Third Beast. But now that the succession of these four Heads even to <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> is the succession of one and the same Kingdome, is plain from Ch. 8. 22. <hi>Now that being broken,</hi> (namely, the great Horn) <hi>where as Four stood up for it, Four Kingdomes shall stand up out of the Nation, but not in his power. And in the latter time of their Kingdome</hi> (the Original has it <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, which the Seventy ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, which is the very same with our <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,</hi> and there is no doubt of the Translation) <hi>a King of fierce countenance—shall stand up.</hi> Which <hi>Grotius</hi> and every one acknowledges to be <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus Epiphanes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="416" facs="tcp:42932:230"/>
Whence it is evident that the whole Succession of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Captains from the first four inclusively even to <hi>Antiochus</hi> his time is one Succession and one Kingdome. For he calls the times of <hi>Antiochus</hi> the <hi>last times of their Kingdome.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Wherefore it is plain, seeing that the Kingdome of <hi>Alexander</hi> is one and the same with the Kingdome of the four Captains, (for that is the <hi>Third</hi> Kingdome) and the Kingdome of the four Captains the same with their Succession even to <hi>Antiochus</hi> his time; that the whole Succession from <hi>Alexander</hi> to <hi>Antiochus</hi> is one Succession and one Kingdome. If this be not demonstratively true, there is no demonstration in Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks. But if this be true, the Kingdome of the <hi>Lagidae</hi> and <hi>Seleucidae</hi> are not the <hi>Fourth Kingdome,</hi> but the Kingdome of the <hi>Romans,</hi> according as all sober men have hitherto held.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. Which we being so firmly assured of, we shall easily know where to seek for this <hi>little Horn</hi> that is said to <hi>change times and laws.</hi> For where can we finde it but amongst those many Horns in the <hi>Roman</hi> Kingdome or Empire? not in the <hi>Greek,</hi> to which <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> appertains. And we have already plainly shewn that the Apocalyptick Beast with seven Heads and ten Horns is this <hi>Roman</hi> Kingdome; and that this Beast once healed, or in such a condition that it may be said of him that he is the <hi>Beast that was, and is not, and yet is,</hi> (which is when he is become <hi>Pagano-Christian)</hi> is this Empire actually divided into Ten Kingdomes, and that together with this Division the Empire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to relapse gradually into Idolatry by the Agency and Guidance of the Two-horned Beast or the Whore, whom I have also shewed to be Synchronal to the healed Beast, or the <hi>Beast that was, and is not, and yet is.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="13">13. But the Beast restored or healed his duration is 42 <hi>months,</hi> which is 1260 <hi>daies,</hi> or a <hi>Time and Times and half a Time.</hi> For the abode of the <hi>Woman in the Wilderness</hi> is indifferently expressed by either of these latter; and the first and the second are joyn'd together in the Vision of the <hi>Outward Court</hi> and the <hi>Two Witnesses.</hi> Wherefore 42 <hi>months</hi> and a <hi>Time and Times and half a Time</hi> being the same with 1260 <hi>daies,</hi> they are the same one with another. But this <hi>little Horn</hi> in <hi>Daniel</hi> we speak of, his reign is also set out by <hi>a Time and Times and half a Time:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is of the same duration with the <hi>Whore</hi> or <hi>Two-horned Beast,</hi> which is Synchronal to the <hi>Beast restored,</hi> whose continuance is 42 months.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore it is a strong suspicion that there is a Coincidence at least of time, if not of affairs, or complication of natures (if not Identity of some) betwixt this <hi>little Horn</hi> in <hi>Daniel</hi> and those three Synchro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, the <hi>restored Beast,</hi> the <hi>Whore,</hi> and the <hi>Two-horned Beast.</hi> For that expression, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 24. <hi>And another shall rise after them,</hi> does not at all hinder, since the Seventy translate <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>behind them,</hi> it signifying order of situation as well as of time. And this being placed <hi>behind</hi> is the most convenient posture for such an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit as is attributed to this Horn, which is said to <hi>throw down</hi> or <hi>humble three Kings:</hi> which is more by treachery and craft then open force.</p>
                        <p n="14">

14. Now from this equality of time it will also follow that the dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this <hi>little Horn</hi> is 1260 years, by the last Consectary of our Joint-Exposition. Which again shews how impossible it is this Horn should be <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes.</hi> To which you may adde that it is said to be <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the rest of the Horns,</hi> in the explication of them. <note n="*" place="margin">Dan. 7. 24.</note> 
                           <hi>And the ten Horns out of this Kingdome</hi> (that is, the <hi>Roman</hi> Kingdome, as has been demonstrated) <hi>are ten Kings that shall arise; and another shall rise</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>behind them, and he shall be diverse from the rest, and he shall subdue three Kings.</hi> Now I demand what one of the ten Kings or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes is so different from all the rest, unless it be an <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Kingdome.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore the Coincidence of time with the <hi>Pagano-Christian</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and the long continuance, as also the difference of this Kingdome from the other ten, is more then a strong suspicion that it is part of the succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of a Kingdome Ecclesiastick, which is necessarily to run along with the Empire professing Christianity. But if the question be whether this part of this <hi>Ecclesiastick</hi> Kingdome be the uncorrupted Kingdome of Christ or the Reign of Antichrist, the solution is not difficult. For that it is not the Kingdome of Christ, is plain, in that Christ is said to come <hi>to burn and consume it.</hi> Whence it is manifest that the Church has not been out in their Conjecture in deeming this <hi>little Horn</hi> to be <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ;</hi> and therefore, say I, the same with the <hi>Two-horned Beast</hi> and the <hi>Whore,</hi> who is plainly <hi>Isochronal,</hi> and, I doubt not but, <hi>Synchronal</hi> to this <hi>little Horn,</hi> and is adjudged to be burnt in the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> as this <hi>little Horn</hi> is here in <hi>Daniel.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="15">15. To speak briefly therefore, This <hi>little Horn</hi> is the Idolatrizing Clergy of the Empire, but more chiefly and particularly that great and notorious part thereof under the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who has been a more then ordinary stickler for both the obtaining this degenerate Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastick Empire in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and in lapsing and keeping down the Empire in Superstition and Idolatry; and therefore is rightly said to be an <hi>Horn</hi> growing out of this Beast, the Symbol <hi>(Beast)</hi> itself, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Grotius</hi> his own Confession, intimating <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="16">16. And if exquisite fitness of Application will assure us of the right sense of a Prophecy, we cannot fail in this, examining every character of this <hi>little Horn.</hi> For as it is <hi>little,</hi> so is the Original of the Popes mean and obscure, and their Secular Principality small in comparison of those Princes they have contested with. Again, As this <hi>Horn</hi> had <hi>the Eyes of a man,</hi> so it is well known that for politick quick-sightedness there has not been any Body of men comparable to the <hi>Roman</hi> Hierarchy; insomuch that it is Proverbial to say, <hi>That the Roman Religion is nothing else but a mere trick of Policy to encrease and keep up the honour, power and wealth of the Pope and his Clergy.</hi> See Sir <hi>Edwyn Sandys</hi> his <hi>Speculum Europae,</hi> and you shall finde this part of the Prophecy fulfilled to admiration, and that it is not for nothing that this <hi>little Horn</hi> is said to have the <hi>Eyes of a man</hi> in it, which is said of no <hi>Horn</hi> in all the Prophecies besides this. Thirdly, As this <hi>Horn</hi> is said to have a <hi>mouth speaking great things,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you mean thereby <hi>boasting of its own Sovereignty</hi> or <hi>Blaspheming,</hi>
                           <pb n="418" facs="tcp:42932:231"/>
it is well known that from this <hi>Horn</hi> are uttered such words as imply the <hi>Pope</hi> greater then all <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Emperours,</hi> nay, that he is not onely said to be <hi>Infallible,</hi> but styled <hi>God,</hi> and declared worthy of divine worship. Fourthly, For the <hi>humbling and subduing three Kings,</hi> which this <hi>Horn</hi> is foretold to doe, is it not long since performed by the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> in his usage of <hi>Leo Isaurus,</hi> in ruining the Kingdome of the <hi>Lombards</hi> to get to himself the Exarchate of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> and in tormenting and disquieting <hi>Henry the Fourth</hi> and his Successours with his Thunder-claps and mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Political Plots, till he wrested from them all their Right and Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in <hi>Italy?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="17">17. Fifthly, and to come nearer to our purpose in hand; Whereas it is said that <hi>he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the Saints of the most High, and think to change Times and Laws; and they shall be given into his hand for a time and times and half a time:</hi> I say, this Idolatrous Clergy has bid fair toward the fulfilling this Period of times already; the Degeneracy of the Church beginning about four hundred years after Christ, and (which is more considerable) they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received so notorious a Check in the Decursion of this <hi>Half-Time,</hi> which is elsewhere called a <hi>Half-Day,</hi> in which his swaggering is pretty well diminished and chastised. Sixthly, And for his <hi>wearing out and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming the Saints of the most High,</hi> he has done it even more bloudily and cruelly then the very Pagans on the Primitive Christians; which is the most furious Opposition against the <hi>Regality</hi> of Christ that can be imagined, thus to wast and destroy his true Subjects. Seventhly, And for his <hi>speaking great words against the most High,</hi> that is, against the Divine Sovereignty, is it not plainly done in the Pope's pretences of having power to dispense with or lay aside the Laws and Injunctions of Christ, of which we have given several Instances in our <hi>Idea of Antichristianism,</hi> and such as are notoriously well known to appertain to that Church? Besides that he is <hi>Reus laesae Majestatis Divinae,</hi> in appointing Religious worship to his canonized Saints, which is an Honour due to God alone. Lastly, In that he is said to <hi>change Times and Laws;</hi> what innumerable Institutes are there of the Pope's injoyning, of which may be truly said what our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our told the Scribes and Pharisees, <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>Whence we see plainly, that this Antichristian Opposition against the <hi>Regal Office</hi> of Christ is very expresly foretold in this Vision of the <hi>little Horn,</hi> which rose up with the <hi>Ten Horns</hi> in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and did fabricate <hi>Imperium in Imperio,</hi> as some phrase it, and became a <hi>Two-horned Beast</hi> in the <hi>Ten-horned Beast,</hi> erecting an Ecclesiastick Antichristian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire within the Civil, in opposition to the true Empire or Kingdome of Christ, and in defeatment of his Power and Laws in the Church; nay, in opposition to those Immutable Laws of the Eternal <hi>Logos</hi> that enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens every man that comes into the world.</p>

Where we may see what has been held un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the reign of the <hi>Whore of Babylon,</hi> (which I have intimated to be the same with that <hi>little Horn</hi> in <hi>Daniel)</hi> by the Description of his Triumph after her Fall. For this Triumphal Pomp is upon her ruine, as it appears from the precedent Chapter that describes it. But the Pomp is descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed thus:</p>
                        <p>11. <hi>And I saw Heaven open, and behold, a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make warre.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>12. <hi>His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a Name written which no man knew but himself.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>13. <hi>And he was clothed with a vesture dipt in bloud; and his Name was called</hi> THE WORD OF GOD.</p>
                        <p>14. <hi>And the Armies which were in Heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>15. <hi>And out of his mouth goeth a sharp Sword, that with it he should smite the Nations; and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the Wine-press of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>16. <hi>And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a Name written,</hi> KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. In this Vision you see that the <hi>Eternal Word of God,</hi> of which the holy Bible is in some sense and some part a Transcript, is at last upon his triumph adorned with many Crowns, and has got into possession of his just Title exposed visibly to the view of all the world in a writing upon the thigh of this great <hi>Heros,</hi> KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS. Which power the <hi>Lady of Babylon</hi> had usurped be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and under the pretence of her <hi>Infallibility</hi> had silenced not onely the express Law of the written Word of God, but most coursly and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously had troden down those Innate Principles of Morality and Reason that the <hi>Eternal Word</hi> had implanted in the Souls of men, and by terrour
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:42932:232"/>
and cruel forcibleness did what she could to smother, stifle and extinguish them. But here the Scene of things is changed, and the pure Word of God has got the victory over the corrupt, Superstitious, Idolatrous and contradictious Opinions, and fond Institutes of that Antichristian Body of men over whom the <hi>Pope</hi> has a special Headship and Sovereignty.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. There is no great difficulty in the understanding this Prophecy, if we have recourse to my <hi>Prophetick Alphabet,</hi> where I have set down what <hi>Horse,</hi> and what the Colour of <hi>White,</hi> signifie. That the <hi>Eyes</hi> of this <hi>Heros</hi> are said to be as a <hi>flaming fire,</hi> intimates his sharp-sighted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, as it is said in the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> That <hi>the Word of God is a discerner</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Heb. 4. 12.</note> 
                           <hi>of the thoughts and intents of the heart,</hi> and that <hi>there is no creature that is not manifest in his sight,</hi> but that <hi>all things lie naked and open unto the eyes of him with whom we have to doe:</hi> Where the <hi>Written Word</hi> and the <hi>Eternal Word</hi> are jointly spoken of, as here they seem to be in this Vision, by an <hi>Henopoeia.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Again, in that his <hi>Eyes</hi> are said to be a <hi>flaming fire,</hi> we may note also how Fire is a Symbol of <hi>Intellectuality,</hi> especially a <hi>flaming fire,</hi> that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies light, as is easily understood out of the Philosophick <hi>Cabbala</hi> of the first Day's Creation.

                           </gap>, as <hi>Plethon</hi> speaks.

                        <p n="4">4. That also of <hi>having a Name written that no man knew but himself</hi> seems to be agreeable to the <hi>Cabbalistical</hi> Doctrine, who make <hi>Aaron</hi> a Symbol of the <hi>Eternal Word</hi> that fills the Universe, as also of Christ who is this <hi>Word Incarnate.</hi> The Allusion therefore may be to <hi>Aaron</hi>'s having the <hi>Tetragrammaton</hi> written upon his Mitre, that Name which is said to be <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, and could be read onely by the High Priest that had it written upon the golden Plate on his Mitre, as <hi>Alcazar</hi> has observed. But in brief, it signifies the Incomprehensibleness and Imperscru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableness of the Divinity of our Saviour; he alone who is it, being able to comprise it.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. And in that <hi>his vesture</hi> is said to be <hi>dipt in bloud,</hi> it is a Symbol of his Passion: so that we may know that it is the <hi>Messias</hi> that is here meant; of whom S. <hi>John</hi> in his Gospel has said, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>The Word was made flesh.</hi> And here he is called <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, <hi>The Word of God,</hi> and yet in a <hi>bloudy garment,</hi> that indicates his Humanity or Terrestrial body, (for this Body is but a Vestment of the Soul, no part of the Man, according to the <hi>Platonists)</hi> which made him capable of suffering death.</p>
                        <p>This is all spoken of our Head and Captain; and yet it may be not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some reflexion upon his Body the Church. To whom also the <hi>riding</hi>
                           <pb n="421" facs="tcp:42932:232"/>
                           <hi>upon white Horses</hi> belongs, as appears in the fourteenth verse. They have also <hi>flammeous and fiery eyes,</hi> because of their Intellectual Graces, and it is said that <hi>the Spiritual man discerneth all things,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. They <hi>have</hi> also <hi>a name that no man knows besides themselves,</hi> which is their New birth, or the participation of the Divine Nature. Their <hi>garments</hi> also <hi>are died in bloud,</hi> in that so many have suffered Martyrdom for the testimony of the Gospel against the Idolatry and Tyranny of Antichrist; and all have been martyr'd, that is, slain and mortifi'd as to the life of sin, and besprinkled also with the bloud of the Lamb in the pardon of what-ever Transgressions are past. And, lastly, they are to be crowned and reign as Kings upon earth, for <hi>the Kingdom is given to the Saints of the most High,</hi> Dan. 7.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. But to return to the Description of this Heavenly <hi>Heros: A sharp-edged Sword</hi> is said <hi>to go out of his mouth.</hi> Which is analogical to that in the Hebrews, <hi>The word of God is quick and powerful, sharper then any two-edged</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Heb. 4.</note> 
                           <hi>sword.</hi> And in that he is said <hi>to rule the Nations with a rod of iron,</hi> it is an allusion to the second Psalm, which is a Prophecie of the <hi>Messias, Thou shalt rule them with a rod of iron, and break them in pieces like a potter's vessel.</hi> Which is a Prophetick Symbol of that wonderful contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of heart that the powerful Word of God makes when sincerely and seasonably evibrated against the enemies of his Kingdom; as in the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> it is said <hi>to divide asunder and cut betwixt soul and spirit, and hew down into the very joints and marrow.</hi> Such is the <hi>Militia</hi> of this Heavenly Host. <hi>He shall smite the Earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips will he slay the wicked,</hi> Esa. 11. 4.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. And in that he is said <hi>to tread the wine-press of the fierceness of the wrath of Almighty God,</hi> it looks as if it referred to that of <hi>Esay</hi> 63. <hi>Who is this that comes from Edom, with his died garments from Bozrah, this that is glorious in his apparel, travelling in the greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save.</hi> Which answers to that in this present Vision, <hi>Whose name is Faithful and True, and in righteousness doth he judge and make war.</hi> But it follows in <hi>Esay, Wherefore art thou red in thy apparel, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the wine-fat? I have troden the wine-press alone, and of the people there was none with me. For I will tread them in my anger, and trample them in my fury, and their bloud shall be sprinkled upon my garments, and I will stain all my raiment. For the day of vengeance is in my heart, and the day of my redeemed is come.</hi> This answers to what is said of the <hi>Rider of the white Horse</hi> in this Vision, that he was <hi>clothed in a vesture dipt in bloud:</hi> Which in both these Prophecies referrs both to the Passion of Christ, and his Spiritual Victories over his Enemies. The <hi>Wine-presses</hi> also answer to one another in each Vision.</p>
                        <p>And being that the <hi>Harvest</hi> is, as our Saviour says, <hi>the end of the world,</hi> the <hi>Vintage,</hi> which is something later then it, must be a later part of the end of the world. So that this Vision of <hi>Edom</hi> and <hi>Bozrah</hi> will very well sute in that respect also to this of the <hi>Apocalyps.</hi> And it is farther conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable that <hi>Bozrah</hi> signifies <hi>Vintage,</hi> and <hi>Edom</hi> the carnal persecutive Church, real enemies to the true <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> as the <hi>Edomites</hi> were to <hi>Israel.</hi> And I need not adde that <hi>Edom</hi> and <hi>Ismael</hi> are Types of one and
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:42932:233"/>
the same thing. So that the warfare seems plainly to be spiritual, as it may be I shall take occasion to clear up more fully in another place.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. Lastly, in that <hi>it is written upon his thigh, KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS,</hi> it shews the Royal Descent of Christ even accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the flesh, as if he had laid claim to this Sovereignty by descent from <hi>David</hi> the King, accordingly as it is said, Chap. 22. <hi>I am the root and off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring of David, and the bright morning-star.</hi> The <hi>root of David,</hi> as to his Divinity; and the <hi>off-spring of David,</hi> as to his Humanity. But the meaning of this part of the Vision is, That the Word of God, that is to say, the Law of Christ, inward and outward, is at last in conspicuous Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, though it had been kept under and plainly troden into the dirt for so long a time in the Reign of the <hi>Two-horned Beast</hi> or the <hi>Whore.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="9">9. But that the Church of Christ, which is his Body, has also a share in this part of the Vision, is easily discoverable. For in that this Title of <hi>King of Kings and Lord of Lords</hi> is written upon his thigh, it signifies also the Dominion of his posterity the Church, as <hi>Ribera</hi> and <hi>Alcazar</hi> have rightly noted, and accordingly as it is said else-where in the <hi>Apocalyps. He has made us Kings and Priests,</hi> &amp;c. And for the <hi>treading of the Wine-press of the wrath of God,</hi> or the subduing of <hi>Edom,</hi> does not Christ doe it by the powerful and convictive zeal of his Saints and faithful Ministers of his Word, who seriously and weightily laying the Law, and the heavy wrath of God against Sinners, to the hearts and consciences of these car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally-complexionated <hi>Edomites,</hi> squeeze out, if I may so speak, their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt bloud, that is, the principle of that ungodly life in them, (for in the bloud thereof is the life thereof) and so making them dead as to sin, after revive them into righteousness unto everlasting Salvation?</p>
                        <p>And so for that <hi>sharp-edged sword</hi> which is here said <hi>to come out of the mouth of Christ;</hi> it is in effect the very same that comes out of the mouths of his Saints, who rule the world by convincing them of their wickedness, and causing them to return to God. This sharp, piercing and vehement Reproof out of the mouths of the people of God against the Beast and the False Prophet is here said to be a <hi>Sword coming out of the mouth of Christ,</hi> because their mouths are his mouth by right use and possession, and he inspires by his Spirit, and they are onely his <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> that transmit this <hi>fiery Law,</hi> this <hi>blast of fire and flaming breath,</hi> as it is called in <hi>Esdras,</hi> whereby the wicked are consumed; They are, I say, but as a seized Gate or Passage through which or in which this sharp-edged Sword, wherewith the Nations are smitten, is so powerfully brandished by our victorious Saviour. For <hi>this Flame</hi> and <hi>this Sword</hi> I take to be clear Truth, and sound and searching Reason inspired from the <hi>Eternal Word,</hi> which whetted with an holy, sincere and unaffected kind of Enthusiastick Zeal, and back'd with an unexceptionable Life and conversation, will be like a sharp-edged sword with the weight of running Quick-silver in the back of it, whose stroke will fall with such a sway, that it will even chine the enemy at one blow, will <hi>divide asunder soul and spirit,</hi> and <hi>pierce through the joynts and marrow,</hi> as the Apostle speaks.</p>
                        <p>But this is more then our present Scope intended, which was onely to
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:42932:233"/>
shew that that Antichristian Opposition which is particularly made against the <hi>Kingly</hi> and <hi>Prophetick</hi> Office of Christ is prefigured in the Prophets; which I hope I have sufficiently done in the Visions of the <hi>Two Witnesses,</hi> of the <hi>little Horn with Eyes,</hi> and in this present Vision of the <hi>Rider of the white Horse.</hi>

                        </p>

                        <p>That this City <hi>Babylon</hi> is not a City of brick and stone, but a Polity, and particularly the <hi>Roman Hierarchy,</hi> I have evidently proved in my Joint-Exposition. And truly it seems improbable to me, that the Spirit of God should put the Apostle upon composing so long and copious a <hi>Threnodia</hi> upon her ruine and desolation, if it signifi'd no more then the burning of the City of <hi>Rome</hi> in a literal sense, and so slightly as did <hi>Toti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,</hi> and with so little design or effect. Wherefore in that sense which we have already given, and do not at all doubt but is true, let us hold on briefly to illustrate the Text.</p>
                        <p>In these two first verses comes in the <hi>Lamentation of the Kings of the Earth,</hi> such as <hi>committed fornication with her,</hi> that is to say, such as were of her <hi>Idolatrous</hi> profession, but, seeing how things went, durst not assist her for fear, but let her burn till the end. Which again shews that <hi>Babylon</hi>'s fall is not at once, but by degrees, as I have already noted. For though her <hi>judgment be come in one hour,</hi> yet the execution of it may take up a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable time.</p>

                        <p>The sense is, As well the Buyers as Sellers of Spiritual Preferments, who had thriven on the trade, shall be very sorry to see the ruine of that Polity that sustained them, but not be able to help it; and shall magnify the great Pomp and Splendour of the Whore amidst their lamentations over their own losses. For it is observable, that this sixteenth verse is the very same in a manner with the fourth of the preceding Chapter, where the <hi>Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Whore</hi> is described. Which is understood of the <hi>Pope,</hi> the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals,</hi> and other Grandees of that Idolatrous Church.</p>
                        <p>Ver. 17. <hi>And every Ship-master, and all the company in Ships, and Sailers, and as many as trade by Sea, stood afar off,</hi>

                        <p>If we consider what <hi>Sea</hi> signifies <hi>stylo prophetico,</hi> the multitudes of men upon Earth; Analogy will easily lead us to the understanding of what may be intimated by <hi>Ships,</hi> namely consecrated Houses disjoyned from the rest, as Ships are usually separate in the Sea. It seems therefore to give a glance at the <hi>Babylonish</hi> Churches abused to gainful Idolatries and Superstitions, where they sell the use, the sight or possession of several consecrated things, exchange Souls out of Purgatory for money, and do <gap reason="foreign">

                           <hi>For thy Merchants were the great men,</hi> &amp;c. Now follows the reason of this great Desolation, which is threefold. The first, The Riot and Lordliness of these Mystical Merchants; they were <gap reason="foreign">

                        </argument>
                        <p n="1">1. THat there must be some such Mystical sense as this in the general of the Burning of <hi>Babylon</hi> and of this Lamentation over her, my Joint-Exposition does make good, it being manifest there that the <hi>Whore of Babylon</hi> and the <hi>Two-horned Beast</hi> are all one, and that consequently not a City, but a Polity is understood thereby. And <hi>Alcazar</hi> himself in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprets this desolation not in a literal sense, but mystical, understanding thereby the Conversion of <hi>Rome Pagan</hi> to Christianity, as I do of <hi>Rome Pagano-Christian</hi> to the pure and Apostolick Christianity again. Which seems to be intimated in the <hi>Vision of Tyre,</hi> which in the Mystery is the same with the burning of <hi>Babylon.</hi> And the Spirit of God seems of set purpose to point us thereto, by the transplanting so entirely the Phrases of the Visions of <hi>Tyre</hi> in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> and <hi>Esay</hi> into this Apocalyptick <hi>Vision of Babylon;</hi> as if he had a minde that we should take notice of a fourth Appellation of this Mystical City, that it is as well <hi>Tyre,</hi> as <hi>Sodom, Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> and <hi>Babylon.</hi> But whereas <hi>Alcazar</hi> would have <hi>Rome Pagan</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by <hi>Tyre,</hi> I conceive that in <hi>Ezekiel Rome Pagano-Christian,</hi> in <hi>Esay</hi> both <hi>Rome Pagan, Christian</hi> and <hi>Pagano-Christian</hi> is typified; as we shall briefly see, and it is not out of our way, these Mystical Merchandises being still concerned therein.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Behold then how lively that High Priest at <hi>Rome</hi> is set out first in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> under the Type of the <hi>King of Tyre,</hi> Chap. 28.</p>
                        <p>Ver. 2. <hi>Son of man, say unto the Prince of</hi> Tyre, <hi>Thus saith the Lord</hi>
                           <pb n="430" facs="tcp:42932:237"/>
                           <hi>God, Because thine heart is lifted up, and thou hast said, I am a God, I sit in the seat of God, in the midst of the Seas; yet thou art man, and not God, though thou set thine heart as the heart of God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Is not this plainly he that sits betwixt the Seas in <hi>Italy,</hi> and exalts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self above every thing that is called God? But this belongs more properly to that part of <hi>Antichristianism</hi> that is opposite to the Divine Grace of <hi>Humility.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Behold, thou art wiser then</hi> Daniel; <hi>there is no secret that they can hide from thee.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This is onely a <hi>Diorismus,</hi> but sets out the pretended <hi>Infallibility</hi> and unerring Inspiration of that grand Pseudo-prophet at <hi>Rome;</hi> as it may also glance at their exquisite cunning and sagacity, and general Intelligence for the management of their Affairs. And some interpret the Text of <hi>Political Wisedom,</hi> wherein <hi>Daniel</hi> was also eximious. And indeed the very <hi>pretence of Infallibility in Divine things</hi> is in this False Prophet onely a <hi>Trick of Policy,</hi> and the direction of their whole frame of Policy entirely carried to the getting of Power and Riches. In pursuance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they will not stick to alter, null or abrogate the Laws, Institutes and Decrees of God himself. Which some would phansy to be alluded to in the name of <hi>Daniel,</hi> which signifies <hi>the judgment of God,</hi> as if they could make Laws and Decrees more judiciously then He; whenas they are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but politick Contrivances for getting of Wealth, as I said, and is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intimated in the following verse.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi>With thy wisedom and with thy understanding thou hast gotten thee riches, and hast gotten gold and silver into thy treasures.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>5. <hi>By thy great wisedom and by thy traffick hast thou encreased thy riches, and thy heart is lifted up because of thy riches.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This is that Mysticall trade which we have already taken notice of in the foregoing Vision of the Ruine of <hi>Babylon.</hi> The following verses to the tenth are a Commination of his destruction; at the end whereof it being added, <hi>Thou shalt die the death of the uncircumcised,</hi> &amp;c. it implies, that this King of <hi>Tyre</hi> in the <hi>Prophetick</hi> style is a <hi>Jew,</hi> which in the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calyptick</hi> Visions sounds as much as <hi>Christian,</hi> whether in profession or in truth. Which is a farther Intimation of the Mystical meaning of this Prophecy.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. But these things are still farther cleared in the following Vision, in the same Chapter.</p>
                        <p>Vers. 12. <hi>Son of man, take up a lamentation upon the King of</hi> Tyre, <hi>and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord God, Thou sealest up the full summe of wisedom and perfect in beauty.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That is to say, There is no policy nor splendour of Empire to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with that of the Bishop of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>13. <hi>Thou hast been in Eden the Garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the Sardius, Topaz, and the Diamond, the Beryll,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Adorned like the <hi>Whore of Babylon</hi> for precious Stones and Jewels, as well he may, the Whore and He being in signification one and the same thing. But in that he is said to be <hi>in the Garden of Eden,</hi> what can be
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:42932:237"/>
more sutable to the pleasantness and deliciousness of <hi>Italy,</hi> which is accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Garden or <hi>Eden</hi> of <hi>Europe?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>14. <hi>Thou art the anointed Cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so: thou wast upon the holy Mountain of God, thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The sense is, Thou art look'd upon as the Infallible Oracle of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom, (for from the <hi>Cherubims</hi> did God speak) and thou art also that High Priest walking in his Sacerdotal Vestments, upon which were those glistering stones that shone like fire, and were an Emblem of the <note n="*" place="margin">

                        <p>15. <hi>Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That is to say, There was no evil nor defect in thee from thy being cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated <hi>Bishop of Rome,</hi> (for <hi>Episcopacy</hi> is of my Institution) untill thou didst degenerate into Superstition and Idolatry, and forsookest the first Apostolick laws of thy Creation, and broughtest that sad Apostasy upon Christendom.</p>
                        <p>16. <hi>By the multitude of thy Merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: Therefore will I cast thee as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane out of the Mountain of God, and I will destroy thee, O covering Cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>By the multiplying of thy merchandises (such as I have described in the foregoing Vision of <hi>Babylon)</hi> thou committest injustice, (these are thy <note n="*" place="margin">Apocal. 9. 21.</note>

                           </gap>) and hast laid violent hands on those that speak against these ungodly tradings, and hast slain the Witnesses of the Truth. Wherefore thou shalt sit no longer on Seven-hilled <hi>Rome,</hi> which is holy for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the name of my Son Christ; but I will bring thee down, who pretendest to be universal Oracle and High Priest over Christendom, and strip thee out of thy Sacerdotal Raiments that glister with precious Stones like Fire, and thus I will destroy thee.</p>
                        <p>17. <hi>Thy heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisedom by reason of thy brightness; I will cast thee to the ground, I will lay thee before Kings, that they may behold thee.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>18. <hi>Thou hast defiled thy Sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, by the iniquity of thy traffick; therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee, and I will bring thee to ashes upon the Earth in the sight of all them that beheld thee.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The summe hereof is this: The greatness and splendour of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> the pursuit and affectation thereof in her and proportionally in the rest of the Grandees of that Clergy, made them corrupt their Policy with wicked Principles, so that <hi>they defiled their Sanctuaries,</hi> that is to say, the Christian Churches, with such Idolatrous and Superstitious worship as made most for their own gain; I mean with such like iniquity of their traffick as I have already intimated in the Vision of <hi>Babylon,</hi> Mass-money, Oblations to Saints and their Images, and the like. Wherefore this
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:42932:238"/>
                           <hi>King of Tyre</hi> is (as the <hi>Whore of Babylon,</hi> which is a Type of the same thing) condemned to be burnt to ashes by a fire which shall break forth from the midst of him; as it is said of the <hi>Whore,</hi> that <hi>the ten Horns,</hi> which were Principalities of her own Jurisdiction, <hi>should hate her, and eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. The Vision is so naturally applicable to the same that the <hi>Whore of Babylon</hi> is, and so hardly applicable in some passages to the <hi>King of Tyre,</hi> that it is no small assurance but that the chief Scope of the Prophecy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects rather <hi>the Bishop of Rome</hi> then the <hi>Tyrian Prince.</hi> Of which we may be farther assured by that other Prophecy to the same sense in <note n="*" place="margin">Esay 23.</note> 
                           <hi>Esay;</hi> where <hi>Forerius</hi> conceives not onely <hi>Rome Pagan</hi> to be spoken of, as <hi>Alcazar,</hi> but says expresly that <hi>John</hi> seems to understand <hi>Civitatem Antichristianorum</hi> by this City of <hi>Tyre</hi> in <hi>Apocal.</hi> 18. though he names not the City: ver. 19. <hi>Alas, alas, that great City, wherein were made rich all that had ships in the Sea!</hi> And with <hi>Forerius</hi> and <hi>Alcazar</hi> joyn'd together, I conceive by <hi>Tyre</hi> to be understood <hi>Rome</hi> become Antichristian, the Antichristian Hierarchy thereof being pointed at as it is in <hi>Babylon.</hi> For S. <hi>John,</hi> as I have above intimated, has plainly directed us to this sense, by transplanting the very self-same phrases into the Vision of <hi>Babylon:</hi> As appears, besides what we have already noted, from the eighth verse of this Chapter; <hi>Who hath taken this counsel against</hi> Tyre, <hi>the Crowning City, whose Merchants are Princes, whose Traffickers are the Honourable of the Earth?</hi> I omit to take notice how patly the <hi>Crowning City</hi> fits that Polity that <hi>in ordine ad spiritualia</hi> pretends to a right of taking off and putting on the Crowns of Kings and Emperours, and have done it with the greatest insultation imaginable: I onely note that the rest an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers exactly to <hi>Apocal.</hi> 18. 23. <hi>Thy Merchants are the great men of the Earth;</hi> as here, <hi>Princes and the Honourable of the Earth.</hi> How well these terms agree to the grandeur of the Pope and Cardinals, and such great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of that Church, is obvious to every one to conceive. But there is something more pleasant that follows and of a good <hi>Omen.</hi> Verse</p>
                        <p>15. <hi>And it shall come to pass in that day, that</hi> Tyre <hi>shall be forgotten seventy years, according to the days of one King; after the end of seventy years shall</hi> Tyre <hi>sing as an Harlot.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Here is both good news and bad news in this verse. For by <hi>Tyre</hi> is here meant, as has been already suggested, <hi>Idolatrous Rome,</hi> who must be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten seventy years according to the days of <hi>One King;</hi> which, say I, is one of the eight Kings in the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> Chap. 17. And by the <hi>Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balistical</hi> sense of the number 70, it is easily discovered who he is; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the <hi>Seventh King,</hi> which is the Succession of the Christian <hi>Caesars,</hi> as I have there noted; the space of whose reign is not here intimated, but their property, by multiplying 10 into 7. Of which the <hi>Cabbalistical</hi> meaning is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That during the whole reign of those <hi>Caesars</hi> (for <hi>Ten</hi> is a Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol of Totality) <hi>Tyre</hi> should be forgotten, that is, the Polity of <hi>Rome</hi> should not be professedly Idolatrous; but after this term, then <hi>Tyre</hi> shall again sing as an Harlot, as it follows, Verse</p>
                        <p>16. <hi>Take an harp, goe about the City, thou Harlot that hast been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, make sweet melody, sing many songs, that thou mayest be remembred.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="433" facs="tcp:42932:238"/>
That is to say, That the <hi>Roman</hi> Hierarchy after that time of the abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Idolatry expired, by fair pretences and bewitching speeches, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modating their harangues and exhortations with much harmony and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness to the corrupt inclinations of the people, shall, by these plausible persuasions and other meretricious Ceremonies and sense-striking Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, bring Idolatrous worship again into the Empire; the will of God, so far as I see, being that it should be so, as it follows Verse</p>
                        <p>17. <hi>And it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years, that the Lord will visit</hi> Tyre, <hi>and she shall turn to her hire, and shall commit forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation with all the Kings of the Earth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And it shall come to pass:</hi> The more determinate sense is, <hi>For it shall come to pass,</hi> otherwise it looks like a Tautologie. Her Apostasy into Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry is here described, like that of the <hi>Whore of Babylon</hi> with whom the Kings of the Earth are said to commit Fornication. And whereas it is said, <hi>For the Lord will visit</hi> Tyre, that is answerable to that <hi>Apocal.</hi> 17. 17. <hi>For God has put in their hearts to fulfill his will.</hi> Which Apostasy also begins, as here after <hi>seventy years,</hi> so there in the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> after the <hi>Seventh King.</hi> But that which follows is most welcome;</p>
                        <p>Ver. 18. <hi>And her Merchandise and her hire shall be Holiness to the Lord: it shall not be treasured nor laid up; for her Merchandise shall be for them that dwell before the Lord, to eat sufficiently, and for durable clothing.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Here the Scene of things is again changed, and that for the best. For In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters generally agree that here is a Conversion to Christ. But S. <hi>Jerom</hi> and some of the Hebrew Writers understand it of the Conversion of the City <hi>Tyrus</hi> herself; <hi>Alcazar</hi> of <hi>Rome Pagan.</hi> But I conceive this Conversion to be of <hi>Rome Pagano-Christian</hi> to the ancient, pure and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick Christianity; which the fitness of things as well in this Vision of <hi>Esay</hi> as those of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> seems sufficiently to assure us of.</p>
                        <p>Nor can it well but be expected, when it is so evident that the People of the Jews was one great Sacrament or Type of the Church of Christ to come, as is inculcated over and over again in the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> abounding so every-where with that Figure we have ventured to term <hi>Israelismus,</hi> I say, it cannot but be expected, that those Nations that were Enemies to the Jews should also bear the Type of such as should be found the Enemies of the true Church of Christ; and that the Prophets predicting things of them in reference to the first Completion which is Literal, should in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altedness of their spirit be raised into such expressions as were more sutable to those whose Types they were, then to them themselves: in such sort as several Prophecies concerning Christ are framed, and noted accordingly by Interpreters; which are either purely Allegorical, or Mixt; of which I <note place="margin">Book 7. Ch. 7. Sect. 2, 3, 4.</note> have spoken in my <hi>Mystery of Godliness.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">6. And truly I think these two Visions of <hi>Tyre</hi> so perfect Predictions of Antichrist and his Fall, that they deserve to be received into the number of the second kind, there being that in them which will not sute with the first Completion of them.

                        <p>Again, The <hi>Prince of Tyre</hi> being threatened with the death of the Uncircumcised implies him a pretended member of the Church of God, and more especially his being called <hi>the anointed Cherub,</hi> and set out by the adornings of the High Priest, and menaced to be cast out of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of God as profane, and lastly reproved for defiling the Sanctuaries.

As is farther hinted, v. 12. where they are said to <hi>take pleasure in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness. For this cause God sends them strong delusion, that they may believe lies,</hi> that is, all the fabulous Impossibilities of Transsubstantiation, Legendary Miracles, and affrightfull stories of Purgatory. Thus one part of their Church becomes Sotts and Bigots; and the other that behold this Scene of things, though they profess themselves of their Church, become a company of profane Atheists and clancular Deriders of all Religion. So miserably does the Christian Faith go to rack by these Impostures.

                        <p>The apparent affectedness of accurate humane Policy, if not worse, in the frame of their Religion, is perstringed in the Vision of the <hi>little Horn with eyes:</hi> And their Atheism and Infidelity in the general, in those passages of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> Chap. 21. 8. <hi>But the fearfull and unbelieving,</hi> &amp;c. and Chap. 22. 15. <hi>For without are dogs.</hi> Which places in what sense they make to the present Theme, I have already declared in my <hi>Idea of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christianism,</hi> and therefore hold it needless to repeat.</p>

Again, ver. 6. <hi>Therefore thus saith the Lord, Because thou hast set thine heart as the heart of God, behold I will bring strangers upon thee, the terrible of the Nations,</hi> &amp;c. To <hi>set his heart as the heart of God</hi> is to have his will in all things. <hi>Who has resisted his Will?</hi> And do they not make the Will of the Pope a Law? <hi>Supremum Numen in terris,</hi> at whose beck and nod all things are to be done, right or wrong; nay, they cannot be wrong if he will have them. Which is to make him have <hi>an heart like God</hi> indeed, not onely an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistible, but infallible one. Thus high has he clombe in the confidence of his own subtilty and policy.</p>

                           <hi>But the terrible of the Nations shall draw their swords against the beauty of his wisdom, and they shall defile his brightness,</hi> saith the Prophet.

This <hi>sitting upon this Mount of the Congregation,</hi> or the Church of God, is marvellously coinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent with that Prophecy of his <hi>sitting in the Temple of God.</hi> Nor is <hi>[In the sides of the North]</hi> put in for nothing, though a thing of little moment in the letter; for it seems to foretell that the Dominion of the Pope was to spread more notoriously <hi>Northward,</hi> and we know he could never make any great business of the <hi>Southern</hi> Churches, the <hi>African</hi> ever resisting him very stoutly. Besides other considerations, which for brevity I omit.</p>

                        <p>The meaning is, Is this the man that did terrifie the world with his dreadful Thunder-claps of <hi>Excommunication,</hi> and by the great Interest he had in the Princes of the Empire, and by the power of his Clergy, could un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hindge and dissettle Principalities and Kingdoms, by reason of the blindness and Superstition of the People?</p>

                        <p>The reason of this dreadful End of the <hi>King of Babylon</hi> is the very same with that of the burning of the <hi>Queen of Babylon</hi> or <hi>the Whore,</hi> (for they are Types of one and the same thing) <hi>And in her was found the bloud of</hi>

The height of the Papal power above that of the Emperour is also prefigured in the Whore's <hi>riding</hi> of the Beast: For certainly the <hi>Rider</hi> is superiour to the Beast that is ridden.

                        <p>To these you may adde that Prediction in <hi>Daniel,</hi> Ch. 7. 24. <hi>And ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther King shall arise after them;</hi> (which I have above shewed to be the <hi>Pope) and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three Kings: And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the Saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws.</hi> Which words plainly imply that extravagant Power that the Pope was to assume to himself, as is easily understood out of what we have already said upon this Text.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. And lastly, It seems to me also to be very clear, that this enormous Pride of the Pope is prefigured again in <hi>Daniel,</hi> Ch. 11. 36, 37. Of which two verses I would make this brief Paraphrase.</p>
                        <p>36. <q>After the reign of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> that Type of Antichrist and notorious Enemy of the People of God in the <hi>Greek</hi> Empire, shall there arise a <hi>Rex Sacrorum,</hi> or rather a Regal <hi>Pontifex,</hi> if you will, who with his formed Body Politick, or Ecclesiastical Power, shall prove the very Antichrist indeed, answering in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire to that wicked <hi>Antiochus</hi> in the <hi>Greek</hi> that immediately preceded it. Which Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astick Prince or <hi>Pontifex,</hi> finding the stream of Affairs and good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to carry him along, shall at last <hi>exalt himself above every God,</hi> that is, every Supreme Magistrate, the Emperour himself not excepted; nay, <hi>shall speak stupendious words</hi> against the Sovereignty of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, as if he had power to abrogate or dispense with the Laws of God and Christ, and were himself <hi>Supremum Numen in terris.</hi> Which Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties he will prosperously carry on for such a time as Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence will permit, that is to say, till <hi>the time and times and half a time</hi> be expired or at the last gasp.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>37. <q>But yet he shall not be a pure Pagan for all this, nor <hi>regard the Gods of his Ancestors</hi> or <hi>Predecessors,</hi> (that is, of the Supreme Magistrates of

But this shall be notable in him, that he shall be outwardly a strict Processor of Coelibate himself, and it shall be against his Pontifical Office to marry, and likewife his Clergy shall be tied to the same Laws, that he might thereby the better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Designs of his rampant and insatiable Ambition; which spirit of Pride and Worldliness shall grow so rank in him, that he shall in time cast off the real and sincere sense of all Religion, and care for no God at all, but magnifie himself above all.</q>

                           <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> and most of the Expofitors, as <hi>Alcazar</hi> does avouch, understand this working of Iniquity in the Apostles time to be onely as a Type and Figure of that which should be under Antichrist; That there was then something either actually in being or a-brewing, that was a previous Representation of the state of the Church under Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ. <hi>Alcazar</hi> would have it the <hi>Roman Paganism</hi> or worship of Idols. But that was no <hi>Mystery of Iniquity.</hi> But it may be he will say, it may be a Type of that which, when it came, would be a <hi>Mystery,</hi> and that a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful one, that is, the living Image of Paganism revived in Christianity; and that therefore the future Mystery did work in its Type as well as was in its Type. For the Empire revived into Idolatry is called the <hi>Beast that was, and is not, and yet is.</hi> The conceit is not altogether extravagant.</p>
                        <p>But I am more inclinable to think that the Apostle might speak of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in Christianity already (I mean in the Professours of it) that bore some similitude with that of the great Antichrist that was to appear in his season; that he might intend by this present working of the <hi>Mystery of Iniquity</hi> some miscarriage in some of the Christians, or some propensions thereto in them, as having got a great smack of the Antichristian Spirit, and particularly of the spirit of contention for Rule and Priority.

                        <p>The remainder of this Prophecy we have expounded already, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore need not renew our Exposition in this place.

The Effect therefore being already in the world, who can doubt but that this is the Prediction of it, especially we having the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon suffrage of Antiquity, that it is to be understood of one that is to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear after the breaking of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire into pieces?

                        <p n="1">1.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Fourthly, By the <hi>working of the Mystery of Iniquity</hi> he understands the persuasions of <hi>Helicon</hi> and other <hi>Aegyptian.</hi> Impostors who were great with <hi>Caius,</hi> and were preparing the way to this grand piece of Impiety.</q>

 in any serious interpretation of Authors, much less of Holy Scripture?</p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Sixthly and lastly, But this is because the rest of the Prophecy seems to speak of a Conjurer or Magician, such as <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was famed to be, whom at <hi>Rome,</hi> riding in the air with his fiery Chariot and Horses, <hi>Peter</hi>
                              <pb n="446" facs="tcp:42932:245"/>
by his prayers to Christ made fall to the ground. And thus was <hi>Simon</hi> consumed by the Spirit of the Lord's mouth, and by the brightness of his coming, as <hi>Grotius</hi> would have it.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. This is a brief account of his Exposition, in which there is scarce one sound Joynt. For as for the first, which understands the <hi>coming of Christ</hi> of the destruction of <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> Whosoever considers that this Epistle is really the <hi>Second Epistle to the Thessalonians,</hi> (as I shall hereafter prove) and that in the <note n="*" place="margin">Ch. 4. v. 15, 16, 17.</note> foregoing Epistle he speaks of the <hi>final coming of Christ,</hi> which is joyn'd with the <hi>Resurrection of the dead</hi> and our <hi>being gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together</hi> and <hi>meeting the Lord in the Air,</hi> he cannot, without great violence to the sense of things, but understand this <hi>coming of Christ and our gathering together unto him,</hi> in this Epistle, of the same time and thing with the other. And still the rather, because of that serious Obtesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Apostle by <hi>this coming of the Lord,</hi> and also, that <hi>they should not be shaken in minde nor troubled,</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> words that signifie so high, as if they were at their wits ends at the apprehension of the matter, whenas the sacking of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> could not so much concern them that lived at <hi>Thessalonica.</hi> And, lastly, <hi>[nor by word, nor by letter, as from us]</hi> seems to referre to the foregoing Epistle, where the Apostle speaking by an ordinary <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, as if he and the rest then alive should meet the Lord in the air, gave the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> occasion to apprehend that <hi>the day of Judgement</hi> would be very shortly: Which mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take therefore he rectifies in this present Epistle. Whence it is plain that the <hi>coming of Christ</hi> is not here understood of the destruction of <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> but of the last Judgement.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. And for the second Joynt, it is but weak also, in that <hi>Caius</hi> could not properly be said to be an Apostate from the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> fith he was never in Covenant with him. Nor did he set his Statue in the Temple at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> which is the chief thing that <hi>Grotius</hi> aims at; much less did he sit there himself, which the words do plainly import. Nor does <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> signifie to <hi>place himself</hi> in the Temple of God, but <hi>to sit</hi> there. So strained is every thing in this Joynt of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.</p>
                        <p>The third were sense good enough, if the things were agreeable. And yet there seems some little flaw in this too. For if <hi>Vitellius</hi> were meant and nothing more, it would have been <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> in both places, as being most fit to express a Person by.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. And for the fourth, It is very improper to call that private and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed purpose of <hi>caius</hi> his setting his Statue in the Temple of God at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi> a <hi>Mystery of Iniquity.</hi> For mere Privacy and Concealment does not make a thing presently a <hi>Mystery;</hi> otherwise every clancular attempt of Theft, Murther or Adultery would be a <hi>Mystery of Iniquity.</hi> But that is a <hi>Mystery</hi> which, though it be spoke out in words, is still mysterious in its own nature, and has some depth with it, be it a bad Mystery or good. But this purpose of <hi>Caius</hi> his placing his Statue in the Temple at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> is no such thing, but onely a plain and conspicuous piece of Impiety, such as every one would understand at first sight. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore those places alledged by <hi>Grotius,</hi> namely, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 25. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 51.
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:42932:245"/>
are nothing to this purpose. For those are arduous and profound Mysteries there mentioned, even after they are divulged.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. What an exorbitant luxation there is in the fifth Joint, I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready taken notice, and indeed I think it cannot be concealed from any. For who would expect, according to the common tenour of speech, but that when the Apostle had begun his Prophecy concerning the <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> whom he calls also the <hi>Son of Perdition,</hi> farther adding that <hi>he is to be revealed,</hi> and that there are under-hand Preparations making for it, and that onely <hi>Lucius Vitellius</hi> hinders the revealing of him in his time, which hinderance will be till the said <hi>Vitellius</hi> be taken away; I say, who would not but expect that the eighth verse, <hi>And then shall that wicked one be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the Spirit of his mouth, and destroy with the brightness of his coming,</hi> (accordingly as he was said before to be as well <hi>the Son of Perdition</hi> as <hi>the Man of Sin)</hi> is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of the same person the Apostle began withall? And yet the <hi>Man of Sin</hi> and <hi>Son of Perdition</hi> is <hi>Caius,</hi> and <hi>the wicked Man</hi> whom the Lord here destroys (and so is plainly the <hi>Son of Perdition</hi> in an eminent sense) is <hi>Simon Magus.</hi> Upon so violent a rack has <hi>Grotius</hi> set the Text to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort false answers from it, and to make it accuse <hi>Caius</hi> and <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> that the <hi>Pope</hi> may escape the suspicion of being taken for <hi>Antichrist.</hi> Wherein <hi>Grotius</hi> his either judgment or conscience does very hazardously lie at the stake.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. And in the last place, now he has gotten to <hi>Simon;</hi> Though I confess the story is not impossible of his fiery Horses and Chariot, much less his fall to the ground by the prayer of <hi>Peter;</hi> yet long before I knew this use of it, the Narration ever seemed to me very incredible, though, I think, I believe the being of <hi>Spirits</hi> and <hi>Apparitions</hi> as firmly as most do. For it look'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to me so like a gambal trick, that I could not but place it among the earlier Legends or pious Fictions of the Church, invented by some idle Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastick to entertain the credulous and superstitious. So notorious a passage as this happening in the City of <hi>Rome</hi> could not have been kept out of the Lives of the <hi>Caesars,</hi> and particularly of <hi>Nero;</hi> in whose life <hi>Suetonius</hi> onely has this short indigitation amongst those Theatrick shows, Ch. 12. <hi>Icarus primo statim conatu juxta cubiculum Neronis decidit, ipsúmque cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ore respersit.</hi> Out of which luckless Representation of a Poetical Fiction this Monastick Legend seems to be framed: in which Relators adde &amp; alter what they please; which does derogate much to the credibility of the Story.</p>

shins, which, it seems, were afterwards at <hi>Brunda</hi> so well again, that he could stand on his legs to cast himself headlong from some precipice, nay, goe up to the higher Stories of an House, (for who would have carried him so high, when a lower room would better have fitted a lame man?) I do not understand how the Prophecy is fulfilled in the <hi>wicked man himself,</hi> which is the proper subject of this Prediction, but onely in <hi>his Horses.</hi> If this Accident had been aimed at in this Prophecy, doubtless <hi>Simon</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self had been consumed, not his <hi>Coach</hi> and <hi>Horses</hi> onely.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. Wherefore admitting <hi>Grotius</hi> his Chronology, who, for his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, pretends that this <hi>Second</hi> Epistle was wrote before the <hi>First,</hi> and in <hi>Caius</hi> his reign; you see how distorted, forced, and incompliable his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position is to the Text, the same falling out here that has in his other mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timings of Prophecy. But to sweep all away at once, I say that both these Epistles were wrote about the ninth or tenth year of the reign of <hi>Claudius,</hi> that is, so many years after <hi>Caius</hi> his death; and that therefore <hi>Grotius</hi> makes <hi>Paul</hi> prophesy of things past. That this is the constant tradition of the Church cannot be denied. But this is not the first time that <hi>Grotius</hi> has broke all the bounds of modesty, to reach at that which vanishes in his hand in the very grasping of it. I know he has some pretences to prove the Second Epistle written before the First, that he might phansy it written as early as he pleases: but the arguments he draws out do cut his own fingers.</p>
                        <p>The first is from the Conclusion of this Second Epistle, <hi>The Salutation of Paul with mine own hand, which is the token in every Epistle: So I write,</hi> viz. <hi>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all, Amen.</hi> This written with <hi>Paul</hi>'s own hand is his Mark or Token in every Epistle. And yet <hi>Grotius</hi> would from hence infer, that this Epistle was wrote first, because there is no such mark in the fore-going Epistle, there being those alive amongst the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> that knew his hand already. But I answer,</p>
                        <p>First, That the fore-going Epistle has this Mark. For does not it end with <hi>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all, Amen?</hi> And this, he said before, is written with his own hand in every Epistle. Wherefore the Mark is equal in both these Epistles.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Unless he had sent them some former Epistle with this Mark, they could not argue that this was his by it.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, He did send an Epistle before this to them, as appears from Ch. 2. 15. <hi>Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions you have been taught, whether by word or our Epistle.</hi> Wherefore this Mark can be no demonstration of priority, for so it had been before that other that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally precedes it; which is a contradiction. And <hi>Grotius</hi> himself does not deny but the Epistle here mentioned was before this, but humoursomly and groundlesly pretends it to be lost, rather then to be the First Epistle accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Canon.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, This <hi>first</hi> according to the Canon of the Church is this very E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle mentioned ch. 2. 15. as appears from the subject of this second Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which plainly is nothing else but a clearing up his meaning concerning the <hi>coming of Christ,</hi> of which he had wrote in the fore-going Epistle, ch. 4. 13. to the end; and ch. 5. 1, 2, 3. where there are such expressions as if the Resurrection and the last Judgment were near at hand, even hanging over their heads.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="449" facs="tcp:42932:246"/>
And therefore, fifthly and lastly, <hi>Paul</hi> does so solicitously give them notice that this Second Epistle is his, and that they may be sure of it from his known Mark written, as in every of his Epistles, with his own hand, that they might by his authority be quieted, by whose, through the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of his meaning, they were so perplexed and troubled. So plainly does this Allegation of <hi>Grotius</hi> make against himself.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. His second argument for the priority of this Second Epistle is this: That the Christians at <hi>Thessalonica</hi> were so few when S. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote, that they did not make a Church or Presbytery, could not make a number suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to constitute an Authoritative Church. And his reason is, <hi>Quòd homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes non ex regula viventes Apostolus hîc non excommunicari praecepit, quod justi coetûs fuerit; sed vitari, quod jus singulorum est.</hi> For answer to which I shall onely set down the words of the Apostle, ch. 3. 14, 15. <hi>And if any man obey not our word, by this Epistle, note that man, and have no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with him, that he may be ashamed: Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.</hi> The words in the Original are, <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p n="1">1.

But such as it is, I shall first briefly set down, and then examine, that it may more fully appear that there is no Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation that can stand in competition with that which the ordinary current of Protestants does agree in; which is usually toward that sense which I have declared.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <q>First then, he, as <hi>Grotius,</hi> interprets the <hi>coming of Christ</hi> of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Secondly, The <hi>Apostasy</hi> or <hi>Falling away</hi> he understands of a Defection from the Faith to the Heresy of the <hi>Gnosticks;</hi> or else of the Apostles leaving of the Jews, and no longer complying with them.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Thirdly, The <hi>revealing of the Man of Sin</hi> is <hi>Simon</hi> his appearing at <hi>Rome</hi> at what time he rode in his fiery Chariot, together with the <hi>Gnosticks</hi> persecution of the Christians.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Fourthly, <hi>That which withholdeth</hi> is the Apostles not giving over to preach to the Jews, nor as yet leaving them as refractary and hopeless.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Fifthly, The <hi>Mystery of Iniquity</hi> which doth already work is a smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered Opposition against Christ and Christians; and an express re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of Christianity, in this Sect of <hi>Gnosticks</hi> under <hi>Simon</hi> and <hi>Carpo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Sixthly and lastly, The <hi>Spirit of God's mouth</hi> is the prayer of <hi>Peter</hi> whereby <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was cast to the ground; and the <hi>brightness of his coming</hi> is the destruction of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> whereby the persecuting <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gnosticks</hi> were overthrown.</q>

Against the first part whereof the same is to be said which was against <hi>Grotius</hi> his, nor need I repeat it. It alone is enough quite to overthrow both their Interpretations, in the judgment of any unprejudiced Reader.</p>
                        <p>Touching the second, <hi>Grotius</hi> averring so confidently that <hi>Simon Magus</hi> his unhappy Pomp was in the beginning of <hi>Claudius</hi> his time, which yet this <hi>Apostasy</hi> must precede, and this latter Interpretation name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no time when this <hi>Apostasy</hi> happened, makes the Application altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uncertain, but if <hi>Grotius</hi> prove in the truth, impossible. And as for that other sense of <hi>Apostasy,</hi> I suspect it is unwarrantable. <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap> a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection onely.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The third is the grand <hi>Basis</hi> of the whole Exposition; but I have already intimated the Incredibility of the Story. Which will be farther suspected by any one that is not over-credulous, if he consider what, in <hi>Baronius,</hi> is adjoyned thereto, namely, that <hi>Peter,</hi> by that extraordinary Miracle he did, in bringing down <hi>Simon Magus</hi> headlong out of the aire by his prayers, was so far from gaining any respect from <hi>Nero</hi> the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of the Combat, that he was imprisoned for so stupendious an Atchiev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Certainly if the people, for that Magicall power which <hi>Simon Magus</hi> vaunted of, honoured him as a God, they would have given much more
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:42932:248"/>
honour to him whom they found more powerfull then <hi>Simon,</hi> who yet called himself <hi>the great power of God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But besides this, <hi>Simon Magus</hi> could not properly be said to be <hi>the Man of Sin that was to be revealed,</hi> when this Epistle was wrote; he having even in the beginning of <hi>Claudius</hi> his time shewed himself an impious Blasphemer by pretending to be a God, and receiving Divine honours at <hi>Rome.</hi> And there is nothing appears to the contrary but that he continued so wicked from that time to the end of his days.</p>
                        <p>And then for his <hi>sitting in the Temple of God;</hi> What Seat or See had he any where? Or what Temple was ever built to him? A <hi>Statue</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is said to have been erected to him, but this is in the beginning of <hi>Claudius</hi> his reign, and therefore before this Prophecy was written. But this <hi>Statue</hi> is no Temple, and it may be but a fictitious Statue, if <hi>Petrus Ciaconius</hi> his conjecture be true, that the rise of that story came from an old Pagan Inscription upon a Marble dug up <hi>Anno</hi> 1574. in the place where this Statue of <hi>Simon</hi> was said to be, which was <hi>Semoni Sango Deo Fidio sacrum,</hi> as you may see in <hi>Baronius.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">5. And for the fourth point; It is not so good Syntax to say <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, when not a person but a thing is understood. Not to omit, that it seems incredible that, if the Apostles breaking off their compliance with the Jews would bring so vast a mischief, (which they could not but foresee by a Prophetick Spirit, or S. <hi>Paul</hi> declare it to them) they would ever be drawn to be accessary thereto, by breaking off this compliance, which was so strong a bank against the inundation of <hi>Gnosticism</hi> and Persecution of the Church.</p>
                        <p>And touching the fifth; There is somewhat the like exception that was against <hi>Grotius</hi> his Exposition, that seems to make any thing concealed a <hi>Mystery,</hi> which is a false notion of the word. For an open and plain Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position or Renunciation of Christianity intended, but concealed, (which is the supposed case here) is no more a <hi>Mystery</hi> then hidden Murther and Adultery, as I said before.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. And as for the sixth and last; It seems somewhat harsh and strained to understand that execution that is done by the <hi>Spirit of the mouth of the Lord</hi> to appertain to <hi>Simon Magus</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and that <hi>destruction wrought by the brightness of his coming</hi> to belong to the <hi>Gnosticks</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in the destruction at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> especially if we consider that there was no Coalition of <hi>Simon Magus</hi> and the <hi>Gnosticks</hi> into one Body Politick, but that they seemed rather to descend from the <hi>Nicolaitans,</hi> as <hi>Baronius</hi> intimates, and so have no reference one to another. Besides that the Text says continuedly, <hi>Whem the Lord shall consume with the Spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming.</hi> Which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but the bright flame and fiery Spirit issuing out of his mouth, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that description in <hi>Esdras,</hi> and upon one and the same Object, which is this <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> the same with the <hi>little Horn</hi> in <hi>Daniel,</hi> which is after this manner to be destroyed.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. To all which you may adde, That if the History of what is here applied be true, and that the <hi>coming of the Lord</hi> be to be understood of the destruction of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and not of the last Judgment; it is a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:42932:248"/>
thing that the first Fathers of the Church, who had a nearer prospect into those <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap>ansactions of the world, could not discern the Completion of the Prophecy in <hi>Simon Magus</hi> and the <hi>Gnosticks,</hi> but that we that stand at the farthest distance from the events should be the quickest-sighted in discerning their Applicability to the Prophecy. But I have already intimated enough to shew the improbability that this should be the main meaning of this Prediction of S. <hi>Paul.</hi> But if I could believe that the condition of <hi>Simon</hi> and the <hi>Gnosticks</hi> was in some sense here perstringed, (as I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess this pious and judicious Interpreter has bid very fair towards the Credibility of it) I should look upon them as a preludious Type to <hi>the great Antichrist,</hi> and should think that passage <hi>[For the Mystery of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity does already work]</hi> to be understood of them, as it may, though the rest of the Prophecy be in many things unapplicable to <hi>Simon,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long onely to <hi>the great Antichrist</hi> indeed, of whom this Magician may be onely a Type or Figure, and truly not an unsignificant one.</p>
                        <p>For as he is a <hi>Magician,</hi> so is that great Antichrist an egregious Sorcerer, and the Head of a numerous Society of Sorcerers and Enchanters.</p>
                        <p>Again, As <hi>Simon</hi> gave the name and first example of that wicked fin of <hi>Simonie;</hi> so these pretended Successours of <hi>Peter,</hi> both they and their Body Ecclesiastick, have notoriously imitated that example of <hi>Simon</hi> in buying and selling Spiritualities.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, Part of <hi>Simon</hi>'s and the <hi>Gnosticks</hi> Apostasy was Judaizing while they made a show of Christianity: And how much Antichrist with his Adherents do Judaize in Ceremonies and in boasting of Works and dead Formalities, is conspicuous to all the world.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, <hi>Simon</hi> and the <hi>Gnosticks</hi> were notorious for filthiness and uncleanness: And so has been the great Antichristian Synagogue, Head and Members.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, Though <hi>Simon</hi> and the <hi>Gnosticks</hi> were thus grosly obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in life and conversation, yet they were <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, extraordinary pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders to and boasters of the certainty of their Knowledge in the Divinest matters, and great esteemers thereof. And is not this the special Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the <hi>Pope</hi> and his Church, that they pretend to be even <hi>infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly</hi> wise and accurately orthodox in knowledge and opinion, but are as foully negligent and as scandalonsly conniving at all debaucheries of life?</p>
                        <p>Sixthly, <hi>Simon</hi> and the <hi>Gnosticks</hi> were opposers and persecuters of the true Church: So is the <hi>Papal</hi> Hierarchy with the Instruments thereof.</p>
                        <p>Seventhly, The Followers of <hi>Simon</hi> polluted themselves with Idols: And so doe the Adherers to the Headship of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Eighthly and lastly, <hi>Simon</hi> exalted himself above every thing that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led God, and received Divine Honours in his own Person upon Earth: Which is also notorious in the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishop.</p>
                        <p>So that while such things as these were acting in the world, and by such as made some show of Christianity, S. <hi>Paul</hi> might well say of that great <hi>Mystery of Iniquity.</hi> That it is already on foot, that it is in some sense acting already, namely in <hi>Simon</hi> and his Followers, as a Type and Prelude to the
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:42932:249"/>
strange pranks of the <hi>great Antichrist,</hi> and that there wants nothing but the removing of that great Obstacle at <hi>Rome,</hi> the Western Caesareate, and then that <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

This Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition is something more plausible then that there of <hi>Alcazar,</hi> (who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands the <hi>Mystery of Iniquity already working</hi> of pure Paganism) but whether it may be the chiefest of all, I leave to the judicious to consider.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time I think I have sufficiently cleared the truth of those main Prophecies in Scripture that concern the enormous <hi>Haughtiness</hi> and <hi>Pride of Antichrist,</hi> which is so apparently opposite to the first branch of the Divine life, <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Lowliness of Spirit.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="8">8. The next is <hi>Purity,</hi> whose Opposite is <hi>Uncleanness.</hi> The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of the Causes that carry to that Vice I have touched already. But as for the Vice it self, it being so inseparable a Concomitant of <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,</hi> which is <hi>Spiritual Adultery</hi> or <hi>Fornication,</hi> I conceive the Spirit of Prophecy for that very reason was the more sparing in particular Prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurations or Predictions thereof. But I do not doubt but that it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in that description of the <hi>great City,</hi> Apocal. 11. <hi>And their bodies shall lie in the street of the great City which is spiritually called So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> &amp;c.

                        <p>Again, those that are excluded out of the <hi>Holy City,</hi> which is so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly opposite to this City called <hi>Sodom,</hi> they are called <hi>Dogs,</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p n="9">9. The third and last is that which is so conspicuously opposite to that last and best of the three Christian Graces, <hi>Divine Love</hi> or <hi>Charity;</hi> and that is the bloudy Antichristian Cruelty against the sincere Servants of Christ. Which is noted in several of those Visions we have already ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, and therefore we need onely produce them.

                        <p>Again, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. The <hi>little Horn</hi> there, which is a Figure of the same Pontifician Power, is said <hi>to make war with</hi> and <hi>to wear out the Saints of the most High,</hi> that is, to consume them and destroy them with perpetual persecutions.</p>

10. A third Presignification is <hi>Apocal.</hi> 11. concerning <hi>the Witnesses. The Beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                                 <desc>•…</desc>

So that the real and sincere Church of Christ, which is his Body, lieth (during the treading under foot the Outward Court) like a dead corps without Political life or power, and also dreadfully wounded, all over gore bloud, by the cruel Murthers, Martyrdoms and Massacres of the faithfull Members thereof.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, <hi>Apocal.</hi> 13. the <hi>Two-horned Beast</hi> is said to animate the <hi>Ten-horned,</hi> (when he had revived into the ancient Idolatrous form of Paganism) to destroy as many as would not yield obedience to him even in his Idolatrous Commands. <hi>And he had power to give life to the Image of the Beast, that the Image of the Beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the Image of the Beast should be killed; And that no man might buy nor sell, save he that had the Mark or the Name of the Beast or the Number of his Name:</hi> that is, As many as would not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess themselves <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> and thereby Paganize in Christianity, should be famished and starved, and not suffered to live. So great is the <hi>Charity</hi> of this Tyramical and Antichristian Power towards the true members of Christ. But <hi>blessed are the dead that die in the Lord,</hi> as it is said in the following Chapter concerning the Martyrdom of those that are murthered by this Pontifician Power.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. Fifthly, That also is a Record of the Antichristian <hi>Roman Cruelty,</hi> (for the Vials are poured upon the Beast, the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Plagues upon the Antichristian <hi>Aegypt) Revel.</hi> 16. where the Angel of the third Vial which turns the Rivers into bloud speaks thus; <hi>Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus. For they have shed the bloud of Saints and Prophets, and thou hast given them bloud to drink; for they are worthy.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Sixthly, As the Ruine of the <hi>King of Babylon</hi> in <hi>Esay,</hi> so the Ruine of the <hi>Whore of Babylon</hi> in S. <hi>John</hi> is imputed to this salvage and barbarous Antichristian <hi>Cruelty,</hi> the murthering of the Saints of God. <hi>The voice of Harpers and Musicians is heard no more in her, no Crafts-man of any Craft is found any more in h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <p>Fourthly, The first <hi>Six Seals,</hi> the <hi>Fight of Michael and the Dragon,</hi> the <hi>Inward Court of the Temple;</hi> all these Visions, their Events I mean, are <hi>finished</hi> within a less while then what <hi>Haggai</hi> calls <hi>little.</hi>

Fifthly, <hi>The Outward Court of the Temple, the Whore of Babylon, the Two-horned Beast, the Ten-horned Beast, the two Witnesses, the Virgin-Company, the Woman in the Wilderness;</hi> the Events also of all these Visions are <hi>in fieri</hi> within less then that time which the Prophet <hi>Haggai</hi> calls <hi>little.</hi> The <hi>Trumpets</hi> also had begun to sound within that time. But the Affairs of the <hi>Seven Churches</hi> might be of a far earlier Accomplishment, and it may be accomplishable over and over again, they being flying Prophecies, and not so affixed to time and place as they seem, and as the rest of the Visions are. Which <hi>Grotius</hi> also has obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. And this I think is sufficient to make good the Title of the Subject of these Prophecies, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>. And no more then this is supposed or rather demonstrated in Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s way of interpreting the <hi>Apocalyps.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Sixthly, They themselves are fain to interpret some Prophecies of Events that fell out or are to fall out above twice five hundred years from the Prediction. As the <note n="*" place="margin">Apocal. 20.</note> 
                           <hi>loosing of Satan,</hi> the <hi>Army of Gog and Magog,</hi> the <hi>Siege of the beloved City,</hi> the <hi>falling of fire from Heaven upon the Besiegers,</hi> the <hi>General Judgment,</hi> and the like. Which are the more contradictious to their own Hypothesis, because they make no such order or concatenation of Visions as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> does. And therefore it will be the harder to make them compliable with <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>. But for the way that I am for, where one thing so handsomely or necessarily hooks in another, the first Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the seven Vials, the last Trumpet the seven Thunders, the last Seal the seven Trumpets, and the first Six of these Trumpets their Synchronalls, as the first Six of the Seals theirs; the whole Volume of Visions in a manner is so of one piece, and one thing follows ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther so continuedly, that when the first Events begin to appear, the whole <hi>Series</hi> may well be said to begin or to be a-doing, and if quickly, quickly. So little Repugnancy has Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s way with <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>.</p>
                        <p>And lastly, Forasmuch as I have so plainly demonstrated that the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocalyps</hi> was not communicated to S. <hi>John</hi> before <hi>Domitian</hi>'s time, and <note place="margin">See Chap. 2.</note> that therefore this Application of the <hi>Seals</hi> and <hi>Trumpets</hi> to the Destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> is not onely harsh (as any one may see in examining them) but also impossible, the Visions being since that Event; and that therefore those Affairs cannot be of the number of those things <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, since they were then past, not future; and that this straining of this phrase is merely for this Exposition's sake, which, if it were seriously stuck to, would make the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> utterly unintelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and consequently unprofitable to the Church, nay, bring an unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able detriment thereto, by depriving us of so illustrious a pledge of Divine Providence: I think these things put together are of infinitely more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to us for to adhere to that ordinary and ancient Interpretation of <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> which I nominated at first, then to this novell one, that has been but newly started merely for the countenancing such Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions of the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> as are not onely extremely harsh and forced, but utterly impossible.</p>

                           <pb n="459" facs="tcp:42932:251"/>
This I hope is even more then enough to remove all prejudice to Truth, that may lie upon any ones mind by reason of the mistaken sense of these words, and inable him without any farther hesitancy to acknowledge the unexceptionable Perspicuity of those Expositions of the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> I have exhibited to his view.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. HAving thus clearly set out the true nature or <hi>Idea of Antichristia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism,</hi> as also plainly made good that such an <hi>Antichristianism</hi> or <hi>Antichrist</hi> as is delineated in that <hi>Idea</hi> is that very <hi>Antichrist</hi> which the Prophecies in the Holy Scriptures do prefigure or soretell, we should now proceed to a more punctual Application of the said <hi>Idea</hi> and Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies to the State of the Church, from such times as it fell into this Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Lapse till this very day.

                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. The first of the first kind whereof was <hi>Idolatry,</hi> in the <hi>Invocation of Saints and Angels,</hi> in the <hi>Worshipping of the Host,</hi> and in the <hi>Adoration of Images.</hi> Wherein though the Universal Practice of the Church of <hi>England</hi> does sufficiently clear her from such gross imputations, yet I think it not amiss, for her greater honour, to bring into light her avowed and declared judgment concerning these matters, that all the world may take notice how sound she is at the Core in these weighty points of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
                        <p>Touching therefore the <hi>Invocation of Saints,</hi> That she does apertly condemn it, appears in the Book of Articles, where she calls it <hi>a fond thing,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Article 21.</note> 
                           <hi>vainly invented, and grounded upon no warrants of Scripture,</hi> but that it is <hi>repugnant to the Word of God;</hi> so far is it from being grounded thereupon. And the second part of the Homily concerning Prayer is wholly spent in proving, <hi>That we are to address our Prayers to none but to God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:</hi> Where there are excellent Arguments to that purpose, and where she does plainly declare that Christ is our onely Mediatour and Advocate; as also she does in the Liturgie, for the cutting away all pretence for the praying to Saints, and does smartly and at once conclude, <hi>That Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is a thing proper to God, which if we attribute unto the Saints, it soundeth to their Reproach, neither can they well bear it at our hands.</hi> Which is equipollent to the judging of it <hi>Idolatry.</hi> For what is <hi>Idolatry</hi> but the doing that worship to a creature which is proper to God? And therefore she compares it with the Pagans offering sacrifice to <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Lystra.</hi> And how the receiving of Divine honour must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to the reproach of what-ever Creature receives it, I have abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Book 1. Ch. 12. Ver. 3. Sect. 4.</note> noted elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>I shall onely urge one place more, which is very explicit and of great weight. The argument runs thus: <hi>Invocation or Prayer may not be made without faith in him on whom we call, but we must first believe in him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can make our prayer unto him; whereupon we must onely and solely pray unto God. For to say we should believe in either Angel or Saint or in any other living Creature, were mere horrible Blasphemy against God.</hi> This is a very remarkable passage, and a Demonstration that the <hi>Invocation of Saints and Angels is flat Idolatry,</hi> it so plainly implying the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of that Excellency which is proper onely to God. Nor can our holy Mother the Church be thought to deem it less <hi>Idolatry</hi> for calling it <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> since all <hi>Idolatry</hi> is so, and is several times called so in Scripture, <note place="margin">Book 1. Ch. 5. Sect. 11.</note> as I have noted in his due place.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Now for the second, <hi>The worshipping of the Host,</hi> which supposes the <hi>Bread trans substantiuted,</hi> she is most declaredly against both the Opinion and Practice. As in the Book of Articles; <hi>Trans substantiation cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Article 28.</note> 
                           <hi>by Holy Writ, but it is repugnant to the plain words of Scripture, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth</hi>

                           <hi>the nature of a Sacrament, and hath given occasion to many Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitions.</hi> Whence she rightly and demonstratively concludes that <hi>the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is not to be carried about, lifted up, nor worshipped.</hi> For there is none that can worship the Host, upon presumption that it is Christ to whom Divine worship is due, but he is <hi>ipso facto</hi> an Idolater, as I have proved elsewhere more at large. And again in the same Book she does ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly declare, <hi>That the Sacrifices of Masses, in the which it is commonly</hi>

                           <hi>said that the Priest does offer Christ for the quick and the dead, to have remission of pain or guilt, are blasphemous Fables and dangerous Deceits.</hi> The truth of which is easy to be understood out of what we have written in our <hi>Idea of Antichristianism</hi> touching Idolatry and the Abuse of Christ's Person and Office in this enormous Errour.</p>
                        <p>And in the Homily concerning the Sacrament she expresly taxes the <hi>Popish Masses</hi> with <hi>Idolatry,</hi> imputing it to the ignorance of the nature of the Lord's Supper. <hi>What hath been the cause of this gross Idolatry but the Ignorance thereof? what has been the cause of this mummish Massing but the Ignorance thereof?</hi> And a little after; <hi>Let us therefore so travail to understand the Lord's Supper, that we be no cause of the decay of God's worship, of no Idolatry, of no dumb Massing, of no hate and malice,</hi> &amp;c. To all which you may adde what is annexed, in our Liturgie, at the end of the Communion, viz. <hi>That the Sacramental Bread and Wine remain still in their very natural substances, and therefore may not be adored, (for that were Idolatry to be abhorred of all faithfull Christians:) And the natural Body and Bloud of our Saviour Christ are in Heaven, and not here; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against the truth of Christ's natural Body to be at one time in more places then one.</hi> Which Rubrick is interserted in our Liturgie with unexceptionable Judgment and Fidelity, and does fully reach the end of its Intersertion. For no man, I think, can be so grosly ignorant or so openly malicious as to pretend that, after this so plain Declaration of our Church, either himself or any one else can become guilty of <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> by that humble posture of <hi>Kneeling</hi> at the receiving of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. And lastly, touching the <hi>Adoration of Images,</hi> there can be nothing more seriously protested against by any Church then this enormous wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness is by ours. To omit how she has perstringed them in the Book of Articles, she does expresly bind the worshippers of them under a curse in her Liturgie, in the Form of Commination, <hi>Cursed is the man that maketh any carv'd or molten Image to worship it.</hi> And in her Homily against the Peril of Idolatry, with a passionate, but unexceptionable and judicious, zeal she does copiously inveigh against the very having of Images in Churches, I mean such as are in any capacity of being worshipped; nay against the very making of the <hi>Image of God or any of the Persons of the Holy Trinity,</hi> yea of <hi>Christ</hi> himself, forasmuch as he is truly God, contending that <hi>no Image can be made of Christ but a lying Image, (as the Scripture pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Homily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Peril of Idolatry, Part 3.</note> 
                           <hi>calls Images Lies;) for Christ is God and Man. Seeing therefore for the Godhead, which is the most excellent part, no Image can be made, it is falsly called the Image of Christ. Wherefore Images of Christ be not onely Defects, but also Lies.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="462" facs="tcp:42932:253"/>
Nor does she stick here, but urges the argument, and truly not without judgement, against the Images of Saints, <hi>whose Souls, the most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent part of them, can</hi> (saith she) <hi>by no Images be represented and expressed.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But concerning the <hi>having such Images in Temples,</hi> she doth with an holy Jealousy peremptorily contend and inculcate that it is plainly against the Second Commandment, adding this reason, <hi>For they being set up, have been, be, and ever will be worshipped, and thereupon become abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Idols, nothing different from those of the Heathen; they being made of the same matter with them, and men having the same conceits of the Saints they are made to, and of their offices, as the Heathen had of their Deities, they worshipping them also with the same Rites and Ceremonies.</hi> And to shew they have the same opinion of their Saints that the Pagans had of their several Gods, she compares such Saints as are made Guardians of Kingdoms to their <hi>Dii Tutelares,</hi> such as <hi>Belus</hi> was to the <hi>Babylonians, Osiris</hi> and <hi>Isis</hi> to the <hi>Aegyptians, Vulcan</hi> to the <hi>Lemnians;</hi> the Guardian Saints of Cities to their <hi>Dii Praesides,</hi> such as <hi>Apollo</hi> was to <hi>Delphos, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva</hi> to <hi>Athens, Juno</hi> to <hi>Carthage,</hi> and <hi>Quirinus</hi> to <hi>Rome;</hi> and, lastly, their Templed Saints to <hi>Jupiter</hi> in the Capitol, and <hi>Diana</hi> in the famous Temple of <hi>Ephesus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And touching one and the same Saints having Images in several places, she parallels our <hi>Lady of Walsingham,</hi> our <hi>Lady of Ipswich,</hi> and our <hi>Lady of Wilsdon,</hi> to <hi>Venus Cypria, Venus Paphia,</hi> and <hi>Venus Gnidia;</hi> to their Sea-Gods, <hi>Neptune, Triton, Nereus</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> S. <hi>Christopher,</hi> S. <hi>Clement</hi> and the <hi>Blessed Virgin;</hi> to <hi>Vulcan</hi> and <hi>Vesta,</hi> Gods of the Fire, S. <hi>Agatha.</hi> And then intimating that, as in ancient Paganism the Affairs of Love, of War, of Diseases in men and beasts were assigned to several Deities, so to several Saints in the Popish Religion, she at last breaks out into this zealous Exclamation, <hi>Where is God's Providence and due honour in the mean time? who saith, The Heavens be mine, and the Earth is mine, the whole world and all that in it is. I give victory, and I put to flight. Except I keep the City, the Watch-man waketh but in vain that keepeth it. Thou, Lord, shalt save both man and beast. But we have left him neither Heaven, nor Earth, nor Water, nor Countrey, nor City, Peace nor War to rule and govern; neither men, nor beasts, nor their diseases to cure: That a godly man might justly for zealous Indignation cry out, O Heaven and Earth and Seas, what madness and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness against God are men fallen into! What dishonour doe the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to their Creatour and Maker!</hi> namely, in reposing a religious trust in those Saints they invoke to these purposes, which can belong to none other but God himself.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. And as touching <hi>the manner of their worshipping these Images and Saints; What meaneth it</hi> (saith she) <hi>that they, after the manner of the Gentile Idolaters, burn Incense, offer up gold to Images, hang up crutches, chains and ships, legs, arms, and whole men and women of wax be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Images, as though by them or Saints (as they say) they were delivered from Lameness, Sickness, Captivity or Shipwreck? Is not this COLERE IMAGINES, to worship Images, so earnestly forbidden in God's Word?</hi>
                           <pb n="463" facs="tcp:42932:253"/>
And a little after, more fully and vehemently, <hi>Wherefore when we see men and women on heaps to goe on Pilgrimages to Images, kneel before them, hold up their hands before them, set up Candles, burn Incense before them, offer up gold and silver unto them, hang up ships, crutches, chains, men and women of wax before them; attributing health and safeguard, the gifts of God, to them or the Saints whom they represent, as they rather would have it; who, I say, can doubt but that our Image-maintainers, agreeing in all Idolatrous Opinions, outward Rites and Ceremonies with the Gentile Idolaters, agree also with them in committing most abominable Idolatry?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Truly, for my part, I must confess I do not at all doubt of it; and therefore from such passages as these and several other of the like nature scattered up and down in this excellent Homily of our Church concerning <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Images,</hi> do think it an easie Task to prove such a state of the Church as is here described to be the very <hi>Image of the Beast</hi> foretold in <note place="margin">Apoc. 13. 14.</note> the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> as any man may discern out of my foregoing Discourse.</p>
                        <p>But I will give my self the trouble of transcribing one or two more pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages: as that upon that famous Act of the good King <hi>Hezekias</hi> in brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a-pieces the <hi>Brazen Serpent,</hi> (when once abused to Idolatry) though set up by the special commandment of God, and so mysterious a Figure of our Saviour himself. <hi>How think you</hi> (saith she) <hi>would that godly Prince, if he were now living, handle our Idols set up against God's command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment directly, and being Figures of nothing but folly, and for Fools to gaze on, till they become as wise as the blocks themselves they stare on, and so fall down like dared Larks in that gaze; and being themselves alive worship a dead stock and stone, gold or silver, and so become Idolaters abominable and cursed before the living God?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">6. And again, <hi>Now concerning excessive decking of Images and Idols with painting, gilding, adorning with precious vestures, pearl and stone; what is it else but for the farther provocation and enticement to spiritual Fornication, to deck spiritual Harlots most costly and wantonly? Which the Idolatrous Church understands well enough. For she being indeed not onely an Harlot, (as the Scripture calleth her) but also a foul, filthy and withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Harlot, (for she is indeed of ancient years) and understanding her lack of nature and true beauty, and great loathsomness which of her self she hath, doth, after the custome of such Harlots, paint herself, and deck and tire herself with gold, pearl, stone, and all kinde of precious Jewels, that she shining with the outward beauty and glory of them may please the foolish phantasy of fond Lovers, and so entice them to spiritual Fornication with her.</hi> Where it is most manifest that the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth (and that with truth and judgement) intimate, that that apostatized Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is prefigured in the Type of the <hi>Whore of Babylon,</hi> accordingly as I have above demonstrated in this present Treatise. And answerable to this just Censure is that which we may reade in the following Page: <hi>Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Prophet</hi> Daniel <hi>in the eleventh Chapter declareth such sumptuous decking of Images with gold, silver and precious stones; to be a token of Antichrist's Kingdome.</hi> Wherein undoubtedly allusion is made to those words of the Prophet, <hi>And a God whom his Fathers knew not shall he</hi>

                        <p>And as touching that ordinary pretence for <hi>Images,</hi> that they are the <hi>Lay-mens Books;</hi> she doth roundly rebuke the Sophistry of so fond a Plea. <hi>But away for shame with those coloured Cloaks of Idolatry, of the Books and Scriptures of Images and Pictures to teach Idiots, nay, to make Idiots and stark Fools and Beasts of Christians. Do men, I pray you, when they have the same Books at home with them, run on Pilgrimage to seek like Books at</hi> Rome, Compostella, <hi>or</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>to be taught by them? Do men light Candles at Noon-day to their Books? Do they burn incense, offer up gold and silver and other gifts to them?</hi> And a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; <hi>Wherefore call them what they list, it is most evident by their deeds that they make of them no other Books nor Scriptures then such as teach most filthy and horrible Idolatry, as the Users of such Books daily prove by continually practising the same.

                        </p>
                        <p>And at last she, winding up towards a Conclusion, determines thus: <hi>True Religion then and pleasing to God standeth not in making, setting up, painting, gilding, clothing and decking of dumb and dead Images, (which be but great Puppets and Babies for old fools in dotage and wicked Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to dally and play with) nor in kissing of them, capping, kneeling, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering to them, incensing of them, setting up candles, hanging up legs, arms, or whole bodies of wax before them, or praying and asking of them or the Saints things belonging onely to God to give. But all these things be vain and abominable and most damnable before God: all such not onely bestowing their money and labour in vain, but with their pains and cost purchasing to themselves God's wrath and utter indignation, and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting damnation both of body and Soul.</hi> And a little after; <hi>Wherefore God's horrible wrath and our most dreadful danger cannot be avoided with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the destruction and utter abolishing of Images and Idols out of the Church and Temple of God: Which to accomplish, God put in the minds of all Christian Princes.</hi> Amen.</p>
                        <p>Thus freely, zealously and judiciously does our Church of <hi>England</hi> condemn the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion of gross Idolatry in all those Points which I have nominated in my <hi>Idea;</hi> nor has she left or appointed any Usage or Ceremony that bears any similitude, or has any affinity with that hainous Crime. So clear is she from this First part of <hi>Antichristianism,</hi> which is the polluting of the Church of Christ with a Pagan-like <hi>Idolatry.</hi>

                        <p n="8">8. I but you will say, we do still celebrate <hi>Saints-daies,</hi> and do still keep <hi>Lent; Surplices</hi> are still worn, and the <hi>Cross</hi> in Baptism still in use.

                        </p>
                        <p>For as for the <hi>Saints-daies</hi> in our Church, they are neither many, whereby the Observation of them may become burthensome, nor are they Idolatrously or Superstitiously observed; there being no Religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship done to the Saints, no Temple nor Altar dedicated to them, nor Prayers directed to them, but onely an honourable mention made of their Vertues for our Christian Imitation. In which thing our Church is very explicite, joyning authority with S. <hi>Austin,</hi> and declaring, <hi>That nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Temples nor Churches ought to be builded or made for Martyrs or Saints, but to God alone; and that there ought no Priests to be appointed for Martyr or Saint, but to God alone:</hi> as you may see in the second part of the <hi>Homily against Peril of Idolatry.</hi> And he that reads what order she gives for the keeping of these Festivals, in her <hi>Constitutions and Canons Ecclesiastical,</hi> will but betray his Impiety in gain-saying so Religious a Purpose.

                        </p>
                        <p>And now concerning <hi>Lent;</hi> that our Church puts a snare upon no mans Conscience in difference of Meats, is plain out of what we meet with in that eminent Prelate Bishop <hi>Jewel,</hi> in <hi>The Defence of his Apology,</hi> (a <note place="margin">Part 2. Ch 14. divis. 1.</note> Book appointed for every Church by publick Authority) where he cites that excellent saying out of <hi>Tertullian, Deus ventre non colitur, nec cibis quos Dominus dicit perire, &amp; in secessu, naturali lege, purgari. Nam qui per escas Dominum colit, prope est ut Dominum habeat ventrem suum.</hi> He whose Religion is so carnal, is but a degree above them that make their Belly their God. And in the same Page he speaks from himself and in plain <hi>English, We weigh not the choice of Fish or Flesh, but the burthen of the Minde, and the snare of the Conscience.</hi> The Church herself also doth declare in the <hi>Homily of Fasting,</hi> That there is no Holiness at all in Meats, and that it is in itself indifferent whether <hi>Lent</hi> be kept by eating of Fish, or by abstaining from all manner of food till night, and then to eat without any choice or difference of meats; and that keeping of <hi>Lent</hi> by abstinence from Flesh is grounded merely upon Policy, and thereupon

appointed by the Magistrate for the increasing of Victuals, Beeves and Sheep, for the greater plenty, and better provision for the Poor, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing out our Navies, and for the enriching the Sea-coast-Towns by Fishing, and making them more populous, and better provided for to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse the Enemy at any Invasion. Which is a very honest and solid ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for our celebrating <hi>Lent</hi> by abstinence from Flesh-meats and feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on Fish, and devoid of all Popery and Superstition.</p>
                        <p>And thirdly, touching the Pompous Histrionical Vestments of Priests, no man can condemn them more heartily or deride them more wittily then our Church hath done in the third part of that never-sufficiently-commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Homily against the Peril of Idolatry:</hi> where, having noted how <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctantius</hi> compared the Idols of the Heathen to the little Puppets that little Girls used to play with, and that the said Idols were but great Puppets for old Fools to play with; <hi>Our Churches</hi> (saith she) <hi>stand full of such great Puppets wondrously decked and adorned, garlands and coronets be set on their heads, precious pearls hung about their necks, their fingers shine with rings set with precious stones, their dead and stiff bodies are clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with garments stiff with gold. You would believe that the Images of Men-Saints were some Princes of</hi> Persia-<hi>land with their proud Apparel; and the Idols of our Women-Saints were nice well-trimmed Harlots tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting their Paramours to wantonness. Whereby the Saints of God are not honoured, but most dishonoured, and their godliness, soberness, chastity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of riches and of the vanity of the world, defaced and brought in doubt by such monstrous decking most differing from their godly and sober lives.</hi> And then comes in what concerns the Priest; <hi>And because the whole Pageant must throughly be play'd, it is not enough thus to deck Idols, but at the last come in the Priests themselves likewise decked with gold and pearl, (that they may be meet servants for such Lords and Ladies, and fit worshippers of such Gods and Goddesses,) and with solemn pace they pass forth before these golden Puppets, and fall down to the ground on their marrow-bones before these honourable Idols; and then rising up again of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer up odours and incense unto them, to give the people an example of double Idolatry, by worshipping not onely the Idol, but the gold also and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches wherewith it is garnished.</hi> What can be more expresly against these Histrionical Ornaments then this?</p>
                        <p>I but you will say, what is this to the <hi>Surplice?</hi> Truly, it is a thing of so little moment, that I had almost forgot it. Why? what Antichristianism do you espy in that, provided it be white and clean? Is not the very Wife of the Lamb in the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> said to be <note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 19.</note> 
                           <hi>araied in fine linen clean and white?</hi> And do you think that the Prophetick style would adorn the Spouse of Christ with such an Habit as in the letter were a special badge of Antichrist? Wherefore it is evident that there is neither Superstition nor Antichristianism simply in wearing a white garment, though there be no garment but may be superstitiously used, and as superstitiously rejected. To consecrate, exorcize or enchant Vestments for the Priests to wear, as is practised in the Apostatized Church, were indeed a palpable piece of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition; or to place any Holiness in them: But this is a thing openly protested against in our Church, who plainly declares in her Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

Ecclesiastical concerning prescribed Apparel, <hi>That her meaning is</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Canon 74.</note> 
                           <hi>not to attribute any holiness or special worthiness to the said garments, but that they are enjoyned onely for decency, gravity and order.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="9">9. And truly for to suspect this kinde of Ornament in our <hi>English</hi> Clergy to serve for either gratifying their Pride, or for an out-side recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of them to the People, that they may the more securely want those more requisite and essential Ornaments of the Minde, is a very weak and groundless surmize. For how can they be thought to pride themselves in such a Garment, or phansy themselves recommendable to the people by such an Ornament as they generally imagine foul and soiled by having been so many Ages worn by that Woman of Apostasies? Wherefore look as narrowly as you will, you cannot espy those Antichristian sins of Pride and Hypocrisie lurking in any the closest fold of this snowy Vest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Which did it not look so bright as to the blinding of your eyes, you might instead of Antichristianism discover the choicest Christian Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces wrapt up in the use of it, I mean those of <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Humility.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For undoubtedly our Heroical Reformers did not, as is the use of some, act out of peevishness and spight, and please their own humour and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuosity of spirit; but as being part of the chast Spouse of Christ, the true Apostolick Church, the Mother of us all, deals as a Mother with all those that profess themselves in any sense Children of Christ's Church, and therefore would not have them divided more then needs. Whence it is that, out of a spirit of Charity and tender kindness, she has in some things in themselves indifferent humbly condescended to symbolize with that lapsed Lady of <hi>Rome,</hi> to bring off her abused Paramours to the pure Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God. Which Condescension, as is well known, took good effect for some space of years, and the Catholicks joyn'd in publick Prayers and Service with us; till that <hi>Woman sitting on the Seven Hills</hi> (who at every turn discovers herself not to be the Mother, but the Harlot that makes nothing of having the Child divided) forcibly rent off the <hi>English Roman</hi> Catholicks from so reasonable and Christian a Communion. And yet for all this does not our Church cease to use this charitable Courtship and sweet Condescension toward them still, to win them off to such a Worship as is every way as graceful as their own, but without the Poison of either Superstition or Idolatry.</p>
                        <p>Which while I consider how long it has been, without the least effect upon the Catholicks of this Nation, I must needs think him either dull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sighted or unjust that will not acknowledge also a third Christian Vertue in our Mother the Church of <hi>England,</hi> superadded to the former, I mean an impregnable and invincible <hi>Patience;</hi> she having not all this time fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len either into that Complaint in the Prophet, <hi>All day long have I stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>

                        <p>Lastly, as touching the <hi>Cross</hi> in Baptism, there is much-what the same reason as of this last, saving that the use thereof was more early in the Church, whence it becomes more venerable for its Antiquity, and is

therefore retained upon that account, as also for the significancy of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony: but without the least reproach to the Sacrament it self, it being acknowledged perfect and complete without it. I will also adde that it is now as seasonable as ever, the Passion of our Saviour being so much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalued and trode under foot by a new generation of men that Paganize in their Hearts, though they cant in the language of Christians. But we need not be over-solicitous in this point, there being so ample satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction offered to the scrupulous in the Book of <hi>Ecclesiastical Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Canon 30.</note> And therefore we will now proceed to those parts of Antichristianism that oppose the <hi>Positive</hi> Ends of the Gospel.

<pb n="470" facs="tcp:42932:257"/>
                           <hi>That although the Church be a Witness and a Keeper of Holy Writ, yet as she ought not to decree any thing against the same, so besides the same ought she not to enforce any thing to be believed for necessity of Salvation.</hi> To which effect she also speaks in another Article touching the Sufficiency of <note place="margin">Article 6.</note> Holy Scriptures. <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> (saith she) <hi>containeth all things necessary to Salvation; so that whatsoever is not read therein, nor may be proved thereby, is not to be required of any man that it should be believed as an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Faith, or be thought requisite or necessary to Salvation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And again to the same purpose doth she speak in that excellent Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the reading and knowledge of Holy Scripture: where with all earnestness she invites every one to the diligent perusing thereof, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, <hi>That in Holy Scripture is fully contained what we ought to doe, and what to eschew, what to believe, and what to love, and what to look for at God's hands at the length;</hi> and tells us the best way for under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of them, in a Paragraph worthy to be written in letters of Gold, toward the end of the first part of the Homily. <hi>And in reading of God's Word</hi> (saith she) <hi>he profiteth not most always that is most ready in turning of the Book, or in saying of it without-book, but he that is most turned into it, that is, most inspired with the Holy Ghost, most in his heart and life altered and changed into that thing which he readeth; he that is daily less and less proud, less wrathful, less covetous and less desirous of worldly and vain pleasures; he that daily (forsaking his old vicious life) increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth in Vertue more and more.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And in the second part of the said Homily she heartens her Sons against those discouragements and stumbling-blocks, which that false and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous Church casts in their way, of pretended difficulty and obscurity; exhorting them to pray to God for Assistence in reading the Scriptures; assuring them that if they be sedulous and serious, what they are at a loss in, God will either send some pious and knowing person (as he did <hi>Philip</hi> to the Eunuch reading the Prophets) to instruct them, or that Himself from above will give light into our minds, and teach us those things that be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for us, and wherein we be ignorant: farther adding out of S. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom, That humane and worldly wisdom or science is not so needful for the understanding of Scripture, but the revelation of the Holy Ghost, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spireth the true meaning into them who with humility and diligence do search therefore.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And lastly, she concludes, <hi>That none be enemies to the reading of God's Word but such as either be so ignorant, that they know not how wholsome a thing it is; or else be so sick, that they hate the most comfortable medicine that should heal them; or so ungodly, that they would wish the people still to continue in blindness and ignorance of God.</hi> How diametrically opposite this <hi>Genius</hi> of our Church is to that <hi>Antichristian</hi> Spirit I have described in his opposings and underminings of the <hi>Regal</hi> and <hi>Prophetical</hi> Offices of Christ, is obvious for any man to discern who listeth but to compare them.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. And now for his <hi>Sacerdotal</hi> Office, which is injured and affronted in multiplying Mediatours, in pretending to offer up the very Body of Christ in the Mass, and in derogating from the virtue of that Sacrifice himself made for the sins of the world, as if it reached not to the <hi>Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
                           <pb n="471" facs="tcp:42932:257"/>
but to the <hi>Guilt</hi> onely, and that every man must satisfie for himself in imposed mulcts and penances, either here or in Purgatory. As for the first, we have already proved it to be contrary to the Doctrine of our Church. And that one Article, part whereof I have cited already against <hi>Transsubstantiation,</hi> will assure us of her rejection of the two latter. <hi>The offering of Christ once made</hi> (saith she) <hi>is that perfect Redemption, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation and Satisfaction for all the sins of the whole world, both origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Article 31.</note> 
                           <hi>and actual; and there is no other Satisfaction for sin but that alone.</hi> And then it follows, <hi>Wherefore the Sacrifices of Masses, in the which it was commonly said that the Priest did offer up Christ for the quick and the dead, to have remission of pain or guilt, were blasphemous fables and dangerous deceits.</hi> See also the Article of the <hi>Justification of Man,</hi> and the Homily of <hi>Salvation and Good Works.</hi> But this is so notorious a Doctrine in our Church, that I need not insist any further upon the proof of her avowing of it.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. As for the Oppositions against the other Titles of Christ specified in the sixth Chapter of the second Book of my <hi>Idea of Antichristianism,</hi> it is manifest that our Church is not concerned therein. For we traffick not in <hi>Legendary</hi> Lies and false Miracles, against the Sacred Title of <hi>Truth;</hi> nor desire to keep the people ignorant of the Scriptures, and to hold them in darkness, against the Sacred Title of <hi>Light;</hi> nor trespass against the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Title of <hi>Life,</hi> by making our Religion consist of dumb shows and heaps of dead Rites and Ceremonies; nor derogate from <hi>the Divinity</hi> of Christ, by giving Religious worship to Saints and Angels; nor offend against his <hi>Paternity,</hi> by making his Children a company of stocks and stones, and by taking away the judgement of discretion from them, and forcing them to believe as the Church believes, right or wrong, with Scripture or against it; and are so farre from injuring the life of any Child of God by any captious and wicked Sanction, that we profess nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite to Salvation but what is plain in Scripture, as appears from what has been already produced out of the Articles of the Church. Which alone will also vindicate her from any imputation of the following points of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristianism against the Peace of Christ's Kingdome. And for absolving Princes from their Oaths, what Church, unless that of <hi>Rome,</hi> ever preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to so blasphemous a Power?</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The next Antichristian Opposition, and which occurrs in the next Chapter, is that against the <hi>Divine Life in general.</hi> Such as <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and all manner of <hi>Superstition, dumb Shows, speaking in an unknown Tongue, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituting silly Penances instead of real Repentance and Amendment of life;</hi> all which our Church is so plainly and professedly against in her Articles and Homilies every-where, and so acknowledgedly, that I will not give my self the trouble of Citation. Some not so well minded may peradventure be over-inclinable to imagine the Episcopal Office and Revenues to have a greater propinquity with that <hi>Hypothesis</hi> at the end of this Chapter then any indifferent man can possibly judge. For he must be very ignorant of the Constitution of Christendome that does not plainly discern that in that <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis</hi> it is the <hi>Papal Hierarchy</hi> that is perstringed and adumbrated: which is done again more fully and particularly in the ninth and tenth Chapters.
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:42932:258"/>
For, for my own part, though I do not know the accurate values of the several Bishopricks of this Nation, yet considering the largeness of their Dioceses and the great burthen as well of care as expensiveness in consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiously executing the Function, truly I cannot imagine them so great but that the weight of the Office will weigh down every-where the value of the Revenue, and we reade in the Gospel that <note n="*" place="margin">Luk. 10. 7.</note> 
                           <hi>the work-man is worthy of his hire.</hi> And concerning the Office and Dignity itself, it cannot sink into my minde, that that Order of the Church which was instituted and in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice in those Ages thereof which were Symmetral, can with any face or conscience be judged Antichristian. And that the Church was Symmetral for about four hundred years after Christ, is a demonstrable Consectary from my Joint-Exposition, and that Joint-Exposition so convincingly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that no Interpretation of any Scripture can be more.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Whence I cannot but wonder that any true Son of the Church of <hi>England</hi> should be so shie of the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> or so fearful of it, that they durst not touch it without a pair of Mittens of <hi>Grotius</hi> his making, for fear it should bite them, that is to say, unless it be unfolded, or rather folded up, in <hi>Grotius</hi> his fond and groundless Explications.

A tast whereof we have in that Catalogue of the evil characters of them that are excluded the <hi>Holy City;</hi> wherein bloudy and inhumane Zeal, as also vain and imposturous Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is so plainly perstringed.

These doth our faithful Redeemer of Souls, who deals <hi>bonâ fide</hi> with Man-kinde, to rescue their abused minds from the Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and burthen of Superstition, note with a mark of Infamy and Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. So fast a friend is the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> to Humanity, to Equity, to Truth and Reason.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. And not to insist upon those passages of the <hi>Apocalyptick</hi> Visions that imply it, (which are more then one or two either) there is the greatest Equity and Reason in the world that every Christian Prince should next under Christ be Supreme Head over all that part of his Church over which he is King or Sovereign, over Clergy as well as Laiety, in Causes Ecclesiastical as well as Civil; and that not any Papal or Presbyterian Power should be above him, as our <hi>English</hi> Episcopacy does most justly and professedly submit unto him. For why should any Clergy-men expect of a Prince who has received like precious Faith with themselves, to fall in his Power by becoming a Christian? Which is as unjust, as it were ridiculous to phansy that every proper man should be bound
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:42932:258"/>
to remit so much of his natural stature as would make him goe lower then the Priest that baptized him. For Christianity does not take away Nature nor Power, but rightly employs it.</p>
                        <p>Could any of the Pagan Emperours, think you, have been brought over to the Christian Faith, if the <hi>Bishop of Rome</hi> would have laid claim to the Headship of the Empire so farre as it became the Church of Christ? or would they not have suspected the preaching the Kingdome of Heaven a trick of the Priests, to make themselves Lords of the Earth? No certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a Prince once become Christian, that is, a Believer and Professour of the Apostolick Faith comprised in the Word of God in those plain and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally-confessed Points of our Religion, is a Person so Sacred, that nothing can mount above him for Headship in his own Dominions. For the anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Spirit whereby we believe to Salvation is infinitely more holy then any external Sacerdotal oil whatsoever. Why may not then so sacred a Fountain be the Head and Influencer of the whole Church? Or whether is Christ greater as he is <hi>Priest</hi> or <hi>King</hi> of Saints? Or who had the preeminence in the Polity of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the Kings or High-Priests of <hi>Israel?</hi> And was not that Polity a Type or Figure of the Church of Christ?</p>
                        <p>The plain Law of Christ is indeed immutable, and it ought to be so; no man upon earth may dispense with one tittle thereof. But for autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizing Interpretations, Opinions, and the Rites and Ceremonies of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Worship, either this is in a Christian Prince's power, and not in the Priest's, or else his Kingdome and safe administration thereof is not in his power. For all these things, according to the Eternal Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and of Reason, are to be in the hand of him that is Supreme Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and it is a contradiction to his Supremacy if it be not so. For he that holds the rains of the Souls of men rules their whole Persons; and the strongest rains are those of Religion. And therefore if any Power distinct from the Kingly pretend to the right of ordering the affairs of Religion farther then his allowance and liking, that Power is really the King, and the King himself a precarious Power, to be blown about and blown out of his Throne by the false breath of these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders to the Headship of the Church, as often and as violently as they please.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore as the plain and confessed Law of Christ is immutable; so what is doubtful and merely Ritual is to have its interpretation, change or continuance at the judgement and discretion of every Christian Prince, who has most justly and necessarily the power of accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting such things to the peace, composure and prosperity of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Nor have the Ecclesiastick Powers any right in an immutable and essential manner to affix to the Christian Religion any thing that is not expresly and declaredly comprised therein according to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority of the Scriptures. For it is an high wrong to that Religion which is to be Everlasting and Universal, to be bound and fettered with either Rites or Opinions that are but Temporary or Topical; or that the Errours and Mistakes of dark Antiquity should become as a Law of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians</hi> to more serious and
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:42932:259"/>
clear-sighted Posterity; or what was fetched up upon some transito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry emergency, that all the importunities and necessities of after-Affairs of the Church, or any parts thereof, should not be able to conjure it down again, for the making the Gospel more freely to run and be glorified.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. And therefore most apertly and judiciously has our Church decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in her Homily of Fasting, <hi>That God's Church ought not neither may it be tied to any order now made or hereafter to be made and devised by the authority of Man, but that it may lawfully for just causes alter, change or mitigate those Ecclesiastical Decrees and Orders, yea recede wholly from them and break them, when they tend either to Superstition or to Impiety, when they draw the people from God rather then work any edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in them.</hi> And in the <hi>Book of Articles</hi> she again plainly asserts, <hi>That it is not necessary that Traditions and Ceremonies be in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Article 34.</note> 
                           <hi>one or utterly alike; for at all times they have been diverse, and may be changed according to the diversity of Countries, Times, and mens man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, so that nothing be ordain'd against God's Word.</hi> And lastly, in the close of that Article, <hi>Every Particular or National Church hath authority to ordain, change and abolish Ceremonies or Rites of the Church ordained onely by Mans authority, so that all things be done to edifying.</hi> Which Affairs of so dispensable and changeable a nature, if they could be ordered by a power distinct from and independent of the Supreme Power of any Christian Nation, and affecting and relishing a private Interest of their own, what wilde commotions and confusions might they cause in a Christian State, while they gore and spurre up the Ass to goe that way where he sees the Angel of the Lord with a drawn sword to drive him back?</p>
                        <p>Wherefore it is most safe and just that in all preter-Essentials to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion, the Supreme Magistrate in every Christian Nation have the allowing or disapproving of them; and that no Rites nor Opinions pass into Decrees, but by his Authority; that the Priesthood may not be able (as they ought to be so faithful to their Prince as not to be willing) to teach or decree any thing against his Interest whose Subjects they are, or against the Safety, Peace and Prosperity of the <hi>whole</hi> State of which they are but part, and therefore ought to have no power to doe any thing indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently of the Prince, who is the <hi>Common Father</hi> of his whole Countrey, and whose Interest is the good and welfare of all: Who therefore must needs be the Head of the Church <hi>over all Causes and Persons as well Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical as Civil,</hi> (as our Church does plainly acknowledge,) that vital Influence may indifferently flow from him into all the members of his Dominions.</p>
                        <p>But this is a point that might have been more seasonably deferr'd till we came to the Antichristian Opposition to the first branch of the Divine Life, which is <hi>Humility,</hi> and which the superlative Pride of the Papal Supremacy does so apparently affront. But that there is not the least smutt of Antichristianism in <hi>Episcopacy</hi> itself, I have already abundantly evinced.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. Now concerning those Oppositions that be made against <hi>Faith,</hi> the
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:42932:259"/>
Root of the Divine Life, our Church is so plainly free from: them (as any one may perceive that pleases but to recount them) that it is enough merely to intimate so much. Onely I cannot let go this seasonable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of triumphing in her behalf, in that she is so throughly reformed from that notorious, though subtle and slim, piece of Antichristianism, I mean that <hi>Self-ended Policy</hi> in those Doctrines and Practices which are so many in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and so profitable, and yet Our Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directed Reformation has perfectly refined us and cleansed us from them all. The consideration whereof must needs make our Mother the Church of <hi>England</hi> look very lovely and amiable to every ingenuous and discerning eye, who cannot but bless God for that due judgment and faithfulness which he put into our Royal and Reverend Reformers; and must be a great satisfaction to every honest Priest or Minister of our Church, that he neither feeds himself nor the people with Lies, after the manner of the <hi>Roman</hi> Priesthood, nor puts one morsell of bread into his mouth filched from the Laiety by fraud and imposture, and that as he labours in the Gospel, so he lives by the Gospel, and not by Figments and cunningly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devised Fables.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. Those Oppositions also against that Divine Grace of <hi>Humility,</hi> which are specified in the ninth, tenth and eleventh Chapters, that our Church is cleared from them, it is more apparent to any one that considers them then that I need give my self the trouble of particularly making it out. The <hi>Pope's Supremacy</hi> is not onely declared against but sworn against, as is very just and right. And though there be peculiar Habits for Clergy-men, yet, as I have noted above, our Church does professedly declare there is no Holiness in any such things, but that they are for decency and distinction. And distinction betwixt Laiety and Clergy is as ancient as Christianity it self, and runs through not onely part but all those <hi>Symme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral</hi> Ages of the Church. So manifest is it that there is not left in the frame of our <hi>English</hi> Church any thing of its own nature Antichristianly opposing that Heavenly and Christian Grace of <hi>Humility.</hi> But if we come to take view of Persons, who can help it but that a Lay-man may be proud as well as a Clergy-man, and a Presbyter as soon as a Bishop? So that all would be Antichristian upon this score.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. And it is as evident that there are none of those Oppositions against that celestiall Grace of <hi>Purity</hi> (noted in the twelfth Chapter) to be found in our Church. And not so onely, but I think we may without vanity (provided it be done with humble thankfulness to Almighty God, who inspired our Heroical Reformers with such exquisite prudence and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) glory in that excellent and fit constitution of things in our <hi>Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities:</hi> Where none are tied up to the Vows of Coelibate, nor confined to separate and solitary cells, to be shewn disguised in some uncouth habit, with circumcised crowns and moaped or bloated looks, as they are wont to shew strange Animals through their several grates at the Tower; but live under more free and manly Laws and ingenuous Exercises, without either the lash or hypocrisy of Superstition, and are appointed to spend their time in such things as may adorn their Souls with real Knowledge and
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:42932:260"/>
Vertue: where also there is an honest and frugal Provision made for them that list to lay their Bodies as well as bury their Minds in the dust of an Academie. Which, if either Nature or some Diviner power has fitted them for it, they may doe with honour; and if they be weary of a single life, they may leave the University when they will, without the least reproach. Which ingenuous and Christian freedom, in my judgment, is infinitely to be preferred before the Superstitious Slavery and Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisy of the <hi>Roman</hi> Monasteries, where people are caged up and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned like so many Captives of the <hi>King of Babylon,</hi> or so many Bond-men or Bond-women of that Mystical <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> to work out imaginary stuff to fill the Churche's Treasury of Merits, which are vended for ready money to encrease the Revenue and to support the Pomp of this magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent Tyrant of <hi>Aegypt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="11">11. Lastly, Concerning those most Antichristian Oppositions against that transcendent Grace of <hi>Charity;</hi> Our English Church is so far from opposing it, that she is exemplary in it, condemning the Doctrines and Practices of that worst of Churches no more then needs must, and courting the adverse party to her Communion by all lawfull accommodations and compliances in her publick Service, if by any means she may gain some of them over to the Truth. Whereas, on the other side, that imperious Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man on the Seven Hills <hi>sits like a Queen,</hi> to whom every one must bow, but she neither bend nor condescend to any thing, but stands as stiff as a <hi>Marpesian</hi> Rock for the maintaining her own Humour and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, though never so point-blank against the Eternal Laws of God and Right Reason.</p>
                        <p>Then for that bloudy and butcherly Decree of <hi>killing of Hereticks,</hi> namely, such as hold against the Tenents of that Church, though those Tenents of this Church be plainly repugnant to express Scripture; How contrary to this Antichristian and Diabolical Spirit is the Doctrine of our Church of <hi>England,</hi> who, as I have above noted, has declared, That no <note place="margin">Article 20.</note> Church has authority to decree any thing against Holy Writ, nor to enforce any thing to be believed for necessity of Salvation besides it, as you may see in the Book of Articles.</p>
                        <p>Nor can they justly frame any excuse for their abominable Cruelty from the <hi>Sanguinary Laws of this Realm against Priests and Jesuites.</hi> For what a vast difference is there, when the one suffer as <hi>Traitors</hi> to their Liege Sovereign, the other because they will not be Traitors and Rebels to God and the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> Christ? for every <hi>Idolater</hi> is so. And no man can submit to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> but he must <hi>ipso facto</hi> submit to <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="12">12. Verily while I consider what an honest and faithfull Spirit breaths in the Book of <hi>Homilies</hi> and other Writings of our Church, and how exquisitely and perfectly we are set free from all that Imposture and Wickedness that can properly be styled Antichristian, by the wise management and solid and sound judgment of our renowned Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, and how that men of this Integrity of mind and soundness in the Faith were then advanced into Power in Church and State by
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:42932:260"/>
the Sovereign Authority; I cannot withhold from declaring that I do not at all doubt but that the Reformation of our <hi>English</hi> Church into such a condition as I have briefly represented, was one eminent <hi>Speciminall</hi> Completion of the Prophecy of the <hi>rising of the Two Witnesses,</hi> and of that Voice from Heaven (that is to say, of the Sovereign Power) saying unto them, <hi>Come up hither.</hi> For every tittle of the Prophecy is exactly applicable to the Event, as any one may find that will try. Besides that so notable a providence as the Protestant Reformation is no-where prophesied of, if not in that Vision. For the <hi>Vials</hi> are none of them within the <hi>Sixth Trumpet,</hi> as the Vision of the <hi>Witnesses</hi> is, but all within the <hi>Seventh,</hi> as I have above plainly enough proved: nor they expressive of the first Reformation in the chief Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances thereof, nor any Vision else save this of the <hi>Resurrection of the Witnesses.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Nor know I any thing that should make a man hesitate, unless it be that the <hi>Witnesses</hi> are said to be raised up <hi>after</hi> three Days and an half, that is to say, three Times and an half, whenas our Reformation fell <hi>within</hi> these Times, namely, in the last Half of a Time. But no Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation can be more trivial then this; That the designation of Time divided into parts, unless some intimation determinate it to one sense, may signify either such a space of time fully finished, or else expiring in the last division thereof. As if one should say, <hi>Post triduum mortis resurrexit Christus,</hi> no man can understand that of Christ's being dead three entire days. And so, <hi>Aliquot post menses,</hi> may as well be rendred <hi>Within some months after,</hi> as <hi>After some months.</hi> And the Seventy do expresly translate that in <hi>Genesis,</hi>

                           </gap> does not imply the time fully run out, but that the last part thereof must then be current. And so it is in this Prophecy, our Reformation happening in the last <hi>Half-Time</hi> or <hi>Half-Day.</hi> So easily is this Scruple removed: And therefore the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication so fit to the Event, that I doubt not but this Vision was a Prediction of it. Which therefore should make our Reformation the more Sacred, and awe men off from either violently tearing it in pieces, or more hiddenly and obliquely corrupting it by foisting in any old out-cast ware disallowed and rejected by our Pious and Judicious Reformers.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. But this is a <hi>Mantissa</hi> cast in over and above the bargain. I had before finished my task, which was briefly to prove (and, if I mistake not myself, I have done it clearly and convincingly) That the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven-inspired Prudence and Judgment of the Royal, Heroical and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Reformers of our Church of <hi>England</hi> have purged her and cleansed her from what-ever Doctrine or professed Practice may rightly and properly be deemed <hi>Antichristian,</hi> and that she holds nor injoyns any thing that is contrary to the truly Catholick and Apostolick Faith.

our free and faithfull Description of the true Nature and <hi>Idea of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christianism,</hi> such as we have demonstrated to be predicted in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies of Holy Scripture, will not fail, I hope, to prove for ever a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Remedy or safe Preservative of her against those two hatefull and destructive diseases of the Church of Christ, <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Schism.</hi> Which good effect of our labours God of his infinite mercy grant, for the onely Merits of the Lord <hi>Jesus.</hi> Amen.</p>

Whether the worshipping of this Magical Complicate by him that is persuaded it is the visible Deity, were Idolatry. 4. Wherein the sinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Idolatry does consist, and that the worship of this Magical Statue was a <hi>Fifth Mode</hi> thereof. 5. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of other cases to these <hi>Five Modes of Idolatry.</hi> 6. That the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping any thing but God, is Idolatry; and of <hi>Numa</hi>'s casting away Image<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worship, and of the affinity of his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion with <hi>Pythagorism.</hi> 7. The first pollution of that Philosophy, and that the Object of Divine worship is as well <hi>One</hi> as <hi>Invisible.</hi> 23</item>

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> 1. The necessity of knowing what <hi>Religious worship</hi> is, for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering of Idolatry. 2. The faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiness of the distribution of Worship into <hi>Latria, Dulia,</hi> and <hi>Cultus civilis.</hi> 3. That Christ onely, who is <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, has such a middle Excellency as may admit Religious worship. 4. That the excess of Excellency in God above that in Saints and Angels is so infinitely more then the excess of
<pb facs="tcp:42932:262"/>
excellency in Saints and Angels above that in Men, that it is extremely forced and irrational to allot worship of one denomination to the first and second, and not rather to the second and last, which, they being fellow-citizens, might right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be called. <hi>Civil.</hi> 5. That no kind of Religious worship is due to Saints and Angels, proved by the Angel's refusing to be worshipped by S. <hi>John.</hi> 6. And also from the near affinity of our natures with theirs. 7. To whom <hi>Origen</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces Good men equal, nor allows the glorious Stars, though they were intellectual, to be worshipped. 8. That the Religious worship of Saints and Angels is no duty of ours, as being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible to the Precepts of neither Table. 9. That <hi>Religious worship</hi> is but One, and due to God onely, proved from our Saviour's answer to the Devil. 10. As also from the Author to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> arguing the Divinity of Christ from <hi>Religious worship</hi> due to him, with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other testimonies. 11.

That the exhibiting of honour to any undue Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, though forcedly or feignedly, by Signs appropriate to the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Divine Excellencies, is palpable Idolatry. 4. And that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there are no stints, or specifick degrees of <hi>Religious worship;</hi> no <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> nor <hi>Hyperdulia,</hi> but all <hi>Latria.</hi> 5. That <hi>Religious worship</hi> is not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to a thing by directing it towards it as a Circumstance, but as an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; and therefore the misapplication thereof as to an Object is requisite to Idolatry. 6. But not that this applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion should be made as to God himself. 7. That the Heathens themselves never committed such a piece of Idolatry, as to give <hi>Religious worship</hi> to that which they knew not to be the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme God, as to the Supreme. 8. That <hi>Religious worship</hi> being but <hi>One,</hi> makes every application thereof to what is not God, <hi>Idolatry.</hi> 9. That the inculcation of the Divinity of Christ proves every Creature uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of <hi>Religious worship.</hi> 31</item>

That Religious worship given to Saints or Angels, though without the use of any <hi>Image</hi> or <hi>Picture,</hi> is Idolatry. 5. That the mere Invocation of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular invisible power is also Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous. 6. Certain Evasions touching the <hi>praying to Saints</hi> answered. 7. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other subterfuge answered. 8. Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Saints by Images a double Idolatry. 9. That it is Idolatry to worship an Image, taking it for the Saint himself. 10. As also the Adoration of any man alive upon Earth. 11. That the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping of the <hi>Eucharistick Bread,</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the real Body of Christ, is Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry. 12. That all the above-said acts are Idolatrous, let men pretend what they will to cover the guilt. 13. And that <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>CHAP.</hi> XIII. 1. That the professing one onely true God does not necessarily quit a People from the guilt or capacity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Idolaters. 2. That to exhibit such Modes of worship as are proper to the true God to a Creature, though we take it for a Creature, is Idolatry. 3. That the Jews were Idolaters, though they professed the onely true God. 4. That the belief of the <hi>Eucharistick Bread</hi> being the real Body of Christ does not excuse the adorer thereof from Idolatry. 5. The case of the Heathen that worshipped the <hi>Sun,</hi> and this of the <hi>Bread-worshippers,</hi> compared. 6. A solution of a Sophism the Author once put upon himself in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse of this <hi>Bread-worship.</hi> 7.

The fondness of distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing betwixt an <hi>Idol</hi> and an <hi>Image,</hi> when they are both made Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Religious worship. 2. That no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what is essentially and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely Excellent is a due Object thereof. 3. That the absence of the Saints from their Images does not excuse the Idolatry. 4. The unlikeliness that there is any true Image of Christ, if it were lawful to worship it. 5. But that it is unlawful to worship it, though there were. 6. That the whole Decalogue is moral. 7. That the use of Images for Memory and Devotion was also the Plea of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then. 8. That external Objects in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worship hinder the perfection there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. 9, 10.

What a wonderful and powerful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercessour the Priest seems upon this pretension. 5. Various ways of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving this gainful persuasion. 6. The unspeakable honour that seems to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crue to the Priest from this stupendious miracle. 7. That it seems to give him a just claim to exemption from Civil jurisdiction, and saves him the labour of endeavouring after Truth and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity. 8.

               <item>
                  <hi>CHAP.</hi> XVI. 1. That <hi>Idolatry</hi> is the highest and most peculiar injury that can be committed against God. 2. That giving Religious honour to Saints or Angels, is really a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching them and blaspheming them. 3. The exceeding great Mischief done to the Soul of man by <hi>Idolatry.</hi> 4. That <hi>Idolatry</hi> turns men into blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Wolves and Bears: 5. And is the Mother and Nurse of the foulest im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purities. 6. That it is the source of all manner of wickedness, and eternal death to the Idolater. 7. The great <hi>Mischiefs</hi> it doth to the Church of Christ. 8. How the Church is lessened by <hi>Idolatry</hi> at home; 9. And the sprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereof hindred abroad: 10.

Though this general esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of the burthen of Superstition from obligation of Conscience and multitude of Observances might suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, yet he will adde a more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Draught of this Limme of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christianism. 4.

               <item>
                  <hi>CHAP.</hi> II. 1. That the safe conveyance of the Apostolick Writings down to us by the Church does not infer her <hi>Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi> 2. That the Plainness of Scripture in points necessary to Salvation takes away the want of an <hi>Infallible</hi> Judge. 3. That the Scripture not pointing to any <hi>Infallible</hi> Judge nor any faithful Keeper of Traditions, does <hi>ipso facto</hi> declare her self the onely sufficient Guide. 4. That there is not onely no want of an <hi>Infallible Judge,</hi> but better there should be none. 5. That the want of <hi>Infallibility</hi> does not take away the Authority of the Church, it being the duty of every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in things really disputable to compro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mize with her. 6. That though a Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Judge be necessary in Civil causes, yet it is nothing so in Points of Religion. 7. That every private man has not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a liberty, but a command, to judge for himself in matters of Faith. 8. The said Right or Priviledge demonstrated also by Reason. 9 That the Reason or Judgment of every private man is not a <hi>private Spirit</hi> in that reproachful sense that some speak it. 10. That the claim to a right of judging for ones self in points of Faith does not make a man su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour to his Church, 11. Nor yet equal; 12. Nor implies that he thinks himself wiser then his Church, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more careful of his own eternal Concerns. 13. That it is not his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Wisedom he sticks to, but the Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God known to all that are not wilfully blind. 14. That the Church is not <hi>Infallible,</hi> proved from the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church. 15. That there is the same reason of the <hi>Christian.</hi> 16. That the want of an <hi>Infallible</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter is no such loss to the common people. 17. That their assurance of the truth of the Scriptures by the Spirit, is a Tenet not so superciliously to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded as some make shew of. 18. That this Spirit is properly the <hi>Spirit of Faith,</hi> distinguishable from that of <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Wisedom.</hi> 19.

That the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Prophecy is not to be monopolized by any one person, but is free. 3. An Excerpt out of <hi>Caelius Secundus Curio</hi> to that purpose. 4. The silencing the Dictates of those common Notions im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in humane Souls, the highest affront to the <hi>Prophetick Office</hi> of Christ that can be. 5.

That it is infinitely more likely that this pretended Prophet should be fallible, then the foregoing Absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities true. 7. That the slaying of the Prophets, 8.

                  <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> 1. The great importance of proving the <hi>Seven Heads</hi> of the Beast to be <hi>Seven Sorts of Governours.</hi> 2. That the proving of the Seven-headed Beast to signify the Idolatrous Roman Kingdom or Empire <hi>quatenus</hi> Idolatrous, will go far toward the proof of the former Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 3. That the Seven-headed Beast is a Kingdom or Empire; 4. And parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the <hi>Roman.</hi> 5. That it is the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous <hi>Roman</hi> Kingdom or Empire. 6. That it is this Idolatrous Empire or Kingdom through all those Ages it is I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous. 7. That it represents the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Kingdom or Empire in those Ages onely in which it is Idolatrous. Whence the true meaning of the <hi>slaying of the Beast,</hi> and a farther confirmation of the foregoing Assertion, is to be understood. 8. That this adequate Representation of the Idolatrous duration of the Empire implies that no Seven single Persons can be the Seven Heads thereof. 9. The same conclusion inferred from the Stigmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing these <hi>Seven Heads</hi> with the note of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> whenas more then <hi>Seven,</hi> nay all, of the Pagan Emperours were Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters. 10. Also from the ordinary form of speech in distinguishing Animals by the number of their parts. 11. And
<pb facs="tcp:42932:267"/>
finally from the certainty of the Seventh Head's being not one single Person but a Succession. 12. That what-ever Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation supposes these Seven Heads Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven single persons is not onely false, but impossible. 13. That it follows from what has been evinced, That the Beast in the 17 chap. of the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> is the Roman Empire degenerated again into a kind of Paganism. 14. As also that the <hi>Whore of Babylon</hi> is not <hi>Rome Pagan,</hi> but <hi>Pagano-christian.</hi> 15.

That the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel having considered the whole Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of the Roman Kingdom or Empire, fixed his mind on that time the Empire was purely Christian, and why. And that it thence appears what succession of the Beast's time is understood. 6. As likewise from his name a little varied into, <hi>Was, is not, and yet is.</hi> Whence the fifth Agreement of the second Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelism is also evinced. 7, 8. How the Angel came to give the Beast these Names: And that there is an <hi>Ellipsis</hi> in the Angel's saying, <hi>The Beast which thou sawest, was, and is not,</hi> &amp;c. 9. That the Name <hi>Was, and is not, and shall ascend,</hi> &amp;c. signifies the successive Order in being, not the actual being or not being of the Beast; with a confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation thereof out of <hi>Alcazar.</hi> 10. A plain Eviction from the Name <hi>[Was, is not, and yet is]</hi> that <hi>[Was, and is, and is not]</hi> do not signifie actual Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence or Non-existence, but order of Existence and Similitude. 11. That <hi>[Is not, and yet is]</hi> would neither be good sense nor any elegancy, unless the Laws of a right Contradiction were

closely touched on in this mysterious As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion. 12. And yet that an absolute Sameness, in either Essence or Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, could not be under this affirmation and negation without falsity. Whence Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude is necessarily intimated thereby. 13. That the certainty of the meaning of this Title <hi>[Was, is not, and yet is]</hi> confirms the sense of the former, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrates a latitant <hi>Ellipsis</hi> in the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of these Names of the Beast; which is farther argued from other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations. 14.

That the Image of the Beast is also in some sort revived in their Funerals. 15. But more considerably in their Religious Frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities under this or that Saint: 16.

In their pretence of bringing down Christ bodily and personally at the Mass: 18, 19. As also in their more pompous Processions. 20. The great Usefulness of the Observation of the punctual correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of the Events hitherto to the Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons touching the state of the Church. 21. His amazement and astonishment at <hi>Grotius,</hi> that he should decline so clear and easie a meaning of the <hi>Image of the Beast,</hi> and take up with one so impossible and so unprofitable. 323</item>

                  <hi>CHAP.</hi> I. 1. The great Usefulness of shewing the folly of <hi>Ribera</hi>'s and <hi>Grotius</hi> his Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions of these two Chapters of the <hi>Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyps.</hi> 2. That, according to <hi>Ribera,</hi> the Beast is the Devil. 3. The seven Kings the wicked Kings of the seven Ages of the world. 4. That five of these Ages were gone over in S. <hi>John</hi>'s time, and that the Reign of Antichrist is the seventh, and <hi>Rome</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the Whore. 5. The general Usefulness of our Joint-Exposition. 6. That the Beast is not the Devil, proved there-from by several circumstances: Nor the seven Heads seven such Ages, by the deadly wound in the sixth Head 7. Nor the Whore <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen more then the Two-horned Beast. 8. That the Devil cannot be the <hi>Beast that was, and is not,</hi> &amp;c. proved by arguments not leaning on our Joint Exposition. 9. Farther proof from that part of his Name <hi>[and yet is,]</hi> with a Vindication of that reading. 10. A confutation of <hi>Ribera</hi>'s Exposition of the seven Heads from the groundlesness and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionableness of his division of the duration of the world into seven Ages. 11. From the Ununitableness of the Kings of the Age into one Head. 12. From the Devil's eminency and superiority over these Heads. 13. From the leaving neither room nor time for an eighth King. 14. From the disproportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness of the seventh Age of the world to the rest, and especially to the strange Feats they say Antichrist is then to atchieve. 15. And last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, from the seven Hills necessarily appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting those seven Heads to the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. 16. That these Expositions of <hi>Ribera,</hi> as also of the rest of the Roman Interpreters, were very weak even in <hi>Grotius</hi> his own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which set him upon minting new ones. 336</item>

                  <hi>CHAP.</hi> II. 1. What the meaning of the <hi>Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let Beast with seven Heads and ten Horns,</hi> and of the <hi>Woman riding him,</hi> is according to <hi>Grotius.</hi> 2. A Confutation of <hi>Grotius</hi> his Interpretation, out of our Joint-Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition. 3. Two main Grounds or necessary Supporters of <hi>Grotius</hi> his Interpretation: The one, That S. <hi>John</hi> reckons the Seven Heads beginning at <hi>Claudius;</hi> with the Confutation thereof. 4. The other, That this Vision was wrote in <hi>Vespasian</hi>'s time; with a Discovery of the weakness and falseness of that Opinion. 5. That <hi>Claudius</hi> his banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Jews</hi> from <hi>Rome</hi> falls many degrees short of a proof, that <hi>John</hi> was then exiled into <hi>Patmos:</hi> And that <hi>Impulsore Christo</hi> in <hi>Suetonius</hi> does not so much as evince that any Christians were then expelled the City. 6. And if the Decree reached Christians, it does not strait follow that S. <hi>John</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned therein. 7. An Answer to a Passage in <hi>Epiphanius</hi> alledged for S. <hi>John</hi>'s Exile then. 8. An Answer to another alledged to the same purpose. 9. That <hi>Epiphanius</hi> his Testimony makes against <hi>Grotius</hi> his main Project. 10. That <hi>Epiphanius</hi> is but one single Father against the rest, and that the Testimony of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> alone is far to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before his. 11. An unexceptionable clearing of the sense of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; and that the very detorsion of it will not serve <hi>Grotius</hi> his turn. 12. That there is not the least shadow of Probability that the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> was wrote before toward the end of <hi>Domitian</hi>'s reign. 13. Proofs out of the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> it self, that it was not wrote before the Persecution under <hi>Domitian.</hi> 14. The great consequence of the clearing this Truth, it wholly subverting all <hi>Grotius</hi> his Interpretations of the <hi>Seals</hi> and <hi>Trumpets</hi> and all their <hi>Synchronals.</hi> 342</item>

                  <hi>CHAP.</hi> III. 1. That as <hi>Grotius</hi> has mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timed these Visions, so his Interpretations are accordingly absurd and incongruous. 2. The groundlesness of his beginning the Compute of the Seven Heads at <hi>Claudius,</hi> and ending it in <hi>Domitian.</hi> 3. The dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sightedness of the ancient Fathers that could not discern <hi>Domitian</hi> to be the <hi>Beast that was, and is not,</hi> though they stood so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding much nearer him then <hi>Grotius.</hi> 4. The trivialness and falsity of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of his. 5. The second, third and fourth Absurdities of <hi>Grotius</hi> his Exposition of this <hi>Seventeenth</hi> Chapter. 6.

                  <hi>CHAP.</hi> IV. 1. That this Mis-timing of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions must needs cast <hi>Grotius</hi> into the like Absurdities in interpreting the Thirteenth Chapter, and that his Exposition of the first verse thereof is guilty of at least nine or ten. 2. Four gross Contradictions in the second. 3. As many Incongruities or Weaknesses in the third. 4. As also in the fourth and fifth. 5. Two Absurdities in the sixth and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth. 6. As many in the eighth. 7. Three Difficulties in the exposition of the tenth verse. 8. Five Incongruities in the eleventh. 9. His gross Interpretation of the twelfth verse. 10. Four Absurdities in the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth. 11. Eight Incongruities or Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses in his expositions on the fourteenth verse. 12. Three in the fifteenth. 13. Three or four more in the sixteenth and seventeenth. 14.

                  <hi>CHAP.</hi> VI. 1. The Synchronism of <hi>the Whore, the Two-horned Beast, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored Beast,</hi> or <hi>the Beast that was, and is not, and yet is;</hi> demonstrated out of our Joint-Exposition. 2. To which <hi>the False-Prophet</hi> is also proved Synchronal; <hi>the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin-Company, the Two Witnesses, the Woman in the Wilderness</hi> and <hi>the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Court,</hi> as being either the same, <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoechal,</hi> or necessarily connected all along with them. 3. Again, in a more abstract way, That <hi>the restored Beast, the Woman in the Wilderness, the Outward Court, the Two Witnesses</hi> are of equal time. 4. That the <hi>Woman in the Wilderness</hi> and <hi>the restored Beast</hi> begin together, and therefore are Synchronal. 5. That the <hi>resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Beast</hi> and <hi>Two Witnesses</hi> are Synchro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, as ending together. 6. That the <hi>Two Witnesses</hi> and <hi>Outward Court</hi> are Synchro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, as both beginning and ending together; And all these four Synchronal to the <hi>Whore</hi> and <hi>Two-horned Beast,</hi> because the <hi>Two-horned Beast</hi> and the <hi>Whore</hi> are Synchro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal to the <hi>restored Beast,</hi> to which the other three are Synchronal. 7. That the <hi>Virgin-Company</hi> and <hi>the Sealed out of the twelve Tribes</hi> are all one Company, and therefore both Synchronal to the <hi>Whore</hi> by an <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and consequently with the rest of the six with whom She is Synchronal. 8. That the said <hi>Sealed Virgin-Company</hi> is Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chronal to the <hi>Series</hi> of the first <hi>six Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets,</hi> as being sealed immediately before the blast of the first Trumpet, and as being Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chronal to the <hi>Mourning of the Witnesses,</hi> which ceases at the end of the sixth Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet. 9. The <hi>six first Seals, the Fight of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:42932:270"/>
                  <hi>and the Dragon, and the Inward Court,</hi> proved Synchronal. 10. That the Vision of <note n="*" place="margin">Apoc. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>measuring the Temple</hi> begins from the first <hi>Epocha,</hi> indicated from the quality of the Person that holds in his hand the opened Book. 11. From his supplying the place of the seventh Angel, and the space of the seventh Trumpet with seven Thunders. 12. From the suspending of the sound of the seventh Trumpet to make a Regression. 13. From the newness or new condition of the Book in the Angel's hand. 14. From the voice communing or talking with <hi>John</hi> from Heaven, as in the beginning of the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the <hi>Seals.</hi> 15. From the <hi>bitterness of the Book in his belly;</hi> From his being bid <hi>again to prophesie,</hi> and that <hi>before many Kings, and Peoples, and Nations.</hi> 16. From the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the Vision of the <note n="*" place="margin">Apoc. 12.</note> ensuing Chapter. 17. The Synchronism of the first <hi>six Seals</hi> with the <hi>Inward Court,</hi> of weighty concernment. 18. The <hi>Millennial Empire of Christ, the Palm-bearing Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, the New Jerusalem</hi> and <hi>the Ligation of Satan,</hi> that they are all in some sense Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chronal to the Seventh Trumpet. 370</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> 1. Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s Account of placing the <hi>first six Vials</hi> within the <hi>sixth Trumpet.</hi> 2. That the truth of this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count depends upon an unlikely sense of the Expiration of the Reign of the Beast, as if immediately after 42 months it should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely and universally expire. 3. A caution touching the Interpreting of the Prophetick style. 4. That the Expiration of the Reign of the Beast upon the <hi>Exit</hi> of the sixth Trumpet is but partial or speciminal, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued from the seventh Trumpet's being also called a <hi>Woe-Trumpet.</hi> 5. As likewise from the seven Thunders. 6. Two more Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to the same purpose. 7. Lastly, from the fixed <hi>Epocha's</hi> of the Middle Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chronals compared with the affairs of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi> 8. That it follows hence that all the <hi>seven Vials</hi> are naturally to take their places in the <hi>seventh Trumpet,</hi> as being the seven last Plagues. 9. The same farther proved from the Song of the Harpers upon their victory over the Beast. 10. And from the order of the Vision of the Vials; as also from the appearing of the Temple (out of which the Angels come) after the sixth Trumpet, and before any of the Vials be poured out. 11. In what sense the Middle Synchronals are to be fulfilled at the <hi>Exit</hi> of the sixth Trumpet. 12 A larger Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion how all the Middle Synchronals expire together, in what sense or degree soever they do expire. 13. Of the commencing of the last Synchronals, and what the time of the <hi>Millennium</hi> more eminently so styled. 14. The serviceableness of the premising these orderly Synchronisms for his farther search into the Prophecies that foretel the <hi>Lapse of the Church into Antichristia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism.</hi> 377</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> 1. That there are Three more Middle Synchronals that foretel the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che's Lapse into Idolatry: As the Vision of the <hi>Outward Court troden down by the Gentiles. 2. The Woman in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:</hi> What meant by <hi>Wilderness.</hi> 3. A brief account of the sense of the whole Vision. 4. That there is an <hi>Hypallage</hi> in her being said <hi>to flie into the Desart,</hi> like that of <hi>Hades being cast into the Fire,</hi> and of the <hi>Kingdom being given to the Saints,</hi> in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel.</hi> 5. That our Interpretation of the <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the Wilderness</hi> does not clash with Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s, though different from it. 6. The third Synchronal, <hi>the Virgin-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany:</hi> The meaning of the Number of their Regiments, and of the <hi>new Song which none could learn besides them.</hi> 7. How the Vision of these Virgin-souldiers implies the Lapse of the Church into Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry. 383</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> 1. Three more Prophecies pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting the Churche's Lapse into Idolatry. As the Vision of the sixth Trumpet, which is proved to respect the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire long after it became Christian. 2. That in this Vision the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Church are both apparently taxed of Idolatry, and with Aggravations common to Pagans and them. 3. That it appears from the same Vision of what great consequence it would be for Christendom to reform from this gross sin, and that they are their best friends that plainly and freely rebuke them for it, and for those other crimes reflected upon in this Vision. 4. The Prophecy of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> proposed, and the first part thereof ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded out of <hi>Epiphanius</hi> touching the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirers of this predicted Errour. 5. As also that part that contains the Errour it self, namely the worship of Daemons: From
<pb facs="tcp:42932:270"/>
whence it is plain the Prophecie concerns this notorious Lapse of the Church into Idolatry. 6. As also from the Instruments of the Broaching this Errour. 7. And from the mentioning of the <hi>Mystery of Godliness</hi> immediately before, to which this <hi>Mystery of Iniquity</hi> is opposed. 8. And lastly from the Times of the Lapse, which are termed <gap reason="foreign">

Grotius</hi> his miss-timing this Prophecie of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and applying it to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus,</hi> how rash and groundless. 3. A Confutation of his Application. 4. The right timing this Prophecie by <hi>Calvin</hi> and Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> who both interpret it of the <hi>Roman</hi> State and Empire. 5. A more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular account of the two first verses of the Prophecie Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s way; 6. As also of the third, 7. And fourth. 8. That the sense of this Prophecie so clearly accords with that of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that it is manifest he refers to it in <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. 9. That though this Interpretation of Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> be unexceptionable throughout, yet the two first verses of the Prophecie may be otherwise expounded, and more suitably to S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Prophecie in his Epistle to the <hi>Thessalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.</hi> 393</item>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> 1. That the <hi>little Horn</hi> in <hi>Daniel</hi> is a Type of that Power which should oppose the <hi>Regal</hi> Office of Christ. 2. That the <hi>Fourth Kingdom</hi> in <hi>Daniel</hi> is not that of the <hi>Lagidae</hi> and <hi>Seleucidae,</hi> but the <hi>Roman,</hi> proved from the universal Consent of Ecclesiastick Writers. 3. From the eminency and greatness of the <hi>Fourth Kingdom.</hi> 4. From the distance of time betwixt the Kingdom of the <hi>Lagidae</hi> and <hi>Seleucidae</hi> and the Kingdom of the <hi>Stone cut out without hands,</hi> or the Kingdom of the <hi>Son of man,</hi> which is also the Kingdom of Heaven or of God. 5 <hi>Grotius</hi> his fond and profane Interpretation of the <hi>Son of man,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:42932:271"/>
as if thereby were meant <hi>the People of Rome.</hi> 6 The like extravagancy in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting <hi>the Stone cut out without hands,</hi> of the same People. 7. The unsoundness of that conceit more particularly discovered. 8. The Kingdom of the <hi>Lagidae</hi> and <hi>Seleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidae</hi> farther proved not to be the Fourth Kingdom, from the Coexistence of the Ten Kings according to Type. 9. From their vastly-differing Periods, the one ending, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Daniel,</hi> presently after <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> the other not before the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 10. From <hi>Daniel</hi>'s making the great Horn the first King in the Third Kingdom, and four lesser to grow up after him on the same Goat's Head. 11. From the four Heads of the Leopard, which are the four Successors of <hi>Alexander</hi> in this Third Beast or Kingdom, and from <hi>Daniel</hi>'s reckoning <hi>Antiochus</hi> in the latter end of this Successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 12.

                  </gap> to fit so well with <hi>Vitellius.</hi> 4. That <hi>Caius</hi> his purpose of placing his Statue in the Temple was no <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of Iniquity,</hi> but gross Prophanevess. 5. <hi>Grotius</hi> his ridiculous luxation of the sense of the Prophecy in making <hi>Caius</hi> the <hi>Man of Sin</hi> and <hi>Son of Perdition,</hi> concealed by <hi>Vitel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> his standing in the way; and yet upon <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellius</hi> his removal, not <hi>Caius,</hi> but <hi>Simon Magus</hi> to be the man revealed and destroyed. 6. That in all likelihood the Story of <hi>Simon Magus</hi> is a Fiction, and from what Occasion. 7. That if it were true, it is not so applicable, this wicked man <hi>Simon</hi> being not consumed by the Spirit of Christ's mouth, but onely his Coach and Horses. 8. That <hi>Grotius</hi> makes <hi>Paul</hi> prophesy of things past, his Epistle being written ten years after <hi>Caius</hi> his death, with a full Answer to <hi>Grotius</hi> his first Argument to the contrary. 9. An Answer to the second. 10. A Demonstration out of Scripture and <hi>Grotius</hi> his own Concessions that this Second Epistle was wrote ten years after <hi>Caius</hi> his death; as also that the fall of <hi>Simon Magus</hi> from his fiery Chariot was eight years before this Prophecy. 445</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>CHAP. XX.</hi> 1. The Preeminence of this latter Interpretation above that of <hi>Grotius.</hi> 2. A summary Proposal of the same. 3. The first part of this Exposition the same with <hi>Grotius</hi> his, and therefore confuted already; The second enervated. 4. The third confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, from a farther discovery of the improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of <hi>Simon Magus</hi> his Story; from his being sufficiently revealed before, and from his not being found to sit in any Temple to receive Divine honours. 5. That <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is not so good Syntax in the present case, nor the wickedness of the <hi>Gnosticks</hi> a <hi>Mystery,</hi> but open Impiety and Hostility against the Church. 6. The harshness of interpreting <hi>whom,</hi> in <hi>[whom the Lord shall consume,</hi> &amp;c.] of two several Subjects, the one to be destroyed by the breath of Christ's mouth, the other by the brightness of his coming, and that in distinct places and times. 7. That if the History of <hi>Simon Magus</hi> had been true, and the Application fit to this Prophecy, the most ancient Fathers would not have failed to have hit upon it; And that it might then have been a preludious Type to the <hi>great An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist</hi> to come. 8. Brief Prophetick Stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures touching <hi>Antichristian Impurity.</hi> 9. The <hi>Antichristian Cruelty</hi> predicted in the Vision of the <hi>King of Babyion</hi> and of the <hi>little Horn.</hi> 10. Also in the <hi>slain Witnesses,</hi> and in the <hi>Two-horned Beast</hi>'s causing the <hi>Ten-horned</hi> to kill as many as would not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship the Image of the Beast nor receive his Mark. 11. In the Vision of the Angel with the third Vial; and in the Declaration of the cause of the Whore's Ruine. 12. And, lastly, in the Description of the <hi>Whore</hi> as drunk with the bloud of the Saints. 13. That all the Members of Antichristianism in our <hi>Idea</hi> are prefigured in the Prophecies of the Holy Writ so expressly, that so clear an evidence cannot be withstood for ever. 14. That that
<pb facs="tcp:42932:272"/>
ample Testimony of the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be evaded by the novel Exposition of <gap reason="foreign">

Her condemning the <hi>Worshipping of Images.</hi> 5. Her concluding the <hi>manner of the Papists worshipping Saints and Images</hi> to be plainly the same with that of <hi>Pagans.</hi> 6. Her free and just censure touching the <hi>decking of their Images,</hi> and making them <hi>Lay-mens Books.</hi> 7. How perfectly she has freed us from that Aegyptian yoke we lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the time of Popery. 8. The <hi>Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>Holy-days,</hi> the keeping of <hi>Lent,</hi> and the use of the <hi>Surplice</hi> in the sense of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> fully vindicated from all impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Superstition or Antichristianism. 9. That the use of the <hi>Surplice</hi> is not from any grounds at all of Policy in the Church, but pure Charity: with a vindication of the use of the <hi>Cross</hi> in Baptism. 459</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>CHAP.</hi> XXII. 1.

As also to that which strikes at his <hi>Sacerdotal</hi> Office. 3. That she holds nothing against those other sacred Titles of Christ, the <hi>Truth, Life, Light,</hi> &amp;c. 4.

What an Establishment that Book is, if rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, to the Crown and Church of <hi>England.</hi> 6. That no Papal nor Presbyterian Power is of right above the King, no not in Causes Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical. 7. The judgement of our Church thereupon. 8. The peculiar glory of our Church that she is so perfectly free from all Frauds and Impostures. 9. Her freeness from Pride; 10. From Antichristian Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity, 11. And from Cruelty. 12. Her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation an eminent Speciminal Completion of the Prophecy of the <hi>Resurrection of the Two Witnesses.</hi> 13. The usefulness of this Vindication of her for the suppressing of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery and Schism. 469</item>
