            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN this lamentable Time of generall Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, our hainous sinnes prouoking Gods just Indignation, this heauy visitation and mortality; I being atendant vpon the Queenes Ma<hi rend="sup">rie</hi> at Hampton Court and from thence within 2 miles of <hi>Oxford</hi> with her Barge (with much greife and remorse) did see and heare the miserable &amp; cold entertainment of many <hi>Londoners,</hi> which, for their preseruation fled and retired themselues from the Cittie into the Country. Whence I noted the peoples Charitie, and great amendment, for they had giuen o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer one of the 7 deadly sinnes, which was <hi>Coueteus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> and in many places were so farre out of loue with a Citizens money, that they abhor'd and hated either to touch or receaue it; entertaining them with bitter wormewood welcome, (which Hearbe was in more request amongst many of them, then any of the heauenly <hi>Graces</hi> or Cardinall <hi>Vertues</hi>) yet the hearbe of <hi>Grace</hi> was in much estimation, although the name of it was a document that they had occasion to <hi>Rue</hi> the <hi>time</hi>; I farther perceiued that they were so farre from beleiuing or crediting any man, that they would or durst not trust their owne noses, but were doubtfull that that sence would conspire with the Plague to murther them, wherefore (like cunning Mariners, or
<pb facs="tcp:25626:4"/>
mole-catchers,) they would craftily in their streetes and highwaies <hi>fetch the winde of any man,</hi> although they were ouer shoes and bootes, and sometimes tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled into a ditch for their labours. This was the time when a man with a nightcap at noone, would haue frighted a whole Parish out of their wits, when to call for <hi>Aquauitae</hi> (though it had beene but to make a drench for a sicke horse was enough to haue his house shut up.

And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, because that the bare and naked trueth was so cleare and ample, that I needed not to stuffe it out with friuolous fables or fantasticall fictions; with my soule, I thankfully acknowledge Gods great mercy exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded towards me (one of the most wretched and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked) in that so many thousands of better life and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation haue falne on my right hand and on my left, and round about me; yet hath his gratious protection beene my guard, for the which in my gratitude to my God, and to auoid the sinne of idlenes, I haue written what those that can may reade.</p>

            <l>The plague hath strooke him, presently they doubt,</l>
            <l>My selfe hath bin perplexed now and then</l>
            <l>With the wind Collick, yeares aboue thrice ten,</l>
            <l>Within the countrey I durst not repeate</l>

               <pb facs="tcp:25626:9"/>Although my pangs, &amp; gripes, and paines were great.</l>
            <l>For to be sick of any kinde of greife</l>
            <l>Would make a man worse welcome then a theefe,</l>
            <l>To be drunke sick, which er'st did credit winne</l>
            <l>Was fear'd infectious, and held worse then sinne.</l>
            <l>This made me, and many more beside,</l>
            <l>Their greifes to smother, and their paines to hide,</l>
            <l>To tell a merry tale with visage glad,</l>
            <l>When as the Collick almost made me mad.</l>
            <l>Thus meere dissembling, many practis'd then,</l>
            <l>And mid'st of paine, seem'd pleasant amongst men,</l>
            <l>For why, the smallest sigh or grone, or shreike</l>
            <l>Would make a man his meat and lodging seeke.</l>
            <l>This was the wretched <hi>Londoners</hi> hard case</l>
            <l>Most hardly welcome into any place,</l>

            <l>
               <hi>Nature</hi> was dead, (or from the countrey runne)</l>
            <l>A <hi>Father</hi> durst not entertaine his sonne,</l>

            <l>But cast into the fire and burnt with speed</l>
            <l>As if they had bin <hi>Hereticks</hi> indeed.</l>
            <l>And late I saw, vpon a Sabaoth day</l>
            <l>Some Citizens at Church, prepar'd to pray:</l>
            <l>But (as they had bin excommunicate)</l>
            <l>The good Church wardens thrust them out the gate.</l>
            <l>Another countrey vertue I'le repeat</l>
            <l>The peoples charity was growne so great</l>
            <l>That whatsoeuer <hi>Londoner</hi> did die,</l>
            <l>In Church or Churchyard should not buried lie,</l>
            <l>Thus were they scorn'd, despised, banished,</l>
            <l>Excluded from the Church, aliue, and dead,</l>
            <l>Aliue, their bodies could no harbour haue,</l>
            <l>And <hi>dead,</hi> not be allow'd a Christian <hi>Graue</hi>:</l>
            <l>Thus was the countryes kindnesse cold, and small,</l>
            <l>No house, no Church, no Christian buriall.</l>
            <l>Oh thou that on the winged windes dost fit</l>

            <l>Then all our thoughts, and words and workes, wee'le frame</l>
            <l>To magnifie thy great and glorious name.</l>

            <l>Vnsearchable, and passe mans finding out,</l>
