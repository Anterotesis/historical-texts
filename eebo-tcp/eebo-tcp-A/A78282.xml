            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF WILLIAM G<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>TTERIDGE, and other Glaſs-makers, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Paſſing a Pattent for Incorporating Sir <hi>Joſeph Herne,</hi> and Others, by the Name of the Glaſs-makers in the Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and Ten Miles Compaſs of the ſame.</head>
            <p>THE Allegations upon which they deſire their Incorporations are falſe; Namely, 1ſt. They ſuggeſt, That by their continued Pains, Induſtry, long Experience in the Trade of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Glaſs, and at their great Coſt and Charges, they have attained to greater Knowledge in the ſaid Manufacture than any others, and make better Glaſs than any heretofore made, and ſome ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver before made.</p>
            <p>Reſponſ.</p>
            <p>Suppoſing this were true; then indeed where they proper to have a Patent for their New Invention, but not to have a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration.</p>
            <p>Beſides in the Corporation of all the Perſons therein named, not above two are Glaſs-Makers, all the reſt are Perſons to whom the Trade doth not of right belong. Beſides, The very Artiſts that now mix their Mettal, and Work their Glaſs, oppoſe their being Incorporated.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. They ſay, if the ſaid Manufacture were well Managed, great Quantities might be Exported, and none Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported; whereas now great Quantities are Imported.</p>
            <p>Reſponſ.</p>
            <p>There were indeed ſome years ſince, great Quantities Imported, but now there is little or none, becauſe the Petitioner make better and cheaper Glaſs, than any heretofore Imported, and do daily Export great Quantities of Glaſs, and could do more, were there a Market for the ſame; and many of the Petitioner Glaſs-Houſes now ſtand unimployed, there being more Glaſs by them than they can ſell.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. They pretend that Joynt-Stocks are neceſſary for carrying on the ſaid Manufacture.</p>
            <p>Reſponſ.</p>
            <p>That cannot be true; for the ſaid Manufacture is at preſent managed by ſeparate Stocks, and ſo managed that more is made of all ſorts, than can be ſold at Home or Abroad.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. They ſay many Artiſt have been forced for what of Imployment here, to go beyond the Seas for Work.</p>
            <p>Reſponſ.</p>
            <p>This they ought to prove; but admit they ſhould, yet if more Glaſs of all ſorts are here made than can be vended, what can a Joynt-Stock do more?</p>
            <p>It is true; two Artiſts indeed were forced to go beyond the Seas, but it was Mr. <hi>Bowles,</hi> one of the Glaſs-Makers named in the intended Corporation, forced them to go, having by Promiſing them greater Wages than Mr. <hi>Bellingham</hi> gave, drawn them into Covenants to ſerve them for a time, and then not performing their promiſe, not releaſing their Covenants, they were forced to go.</p>
            <p n="5">5thly. They pretend that they had agreed with moſt of the Proprietors Intereſſed in the Glaſs-Houſes in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and 10 Miles diſtance of the ſame.</p>
            <p>Reſponſ.</p>
            <p>There are but about two and twenty Glaſs-Houſes in <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and ten Miles diſtance of the ſame, of which, thoſe named in the intended Corporation have but five, and the Petitioners, have twelve; the reſt may be preſumed to ſtand Neuters.</p>
            <p>Beſides moſt of the Glaſs-makers at <hi>New-Caſtle</hi> and <hi>Sturbridge,</hi> oppoſe the ſaid Corporation; and though their Glaſs-houſes are fair remote, yet there Market is here in <hi>London,</hi> and they have Agents here.</p>
            <p>And ſo if their Allegations and Pretenſions, upon which they deſire to become Incorporated are falſe, then the Corporation or Subſtructure on ſuch a falſe Foundation ſhould certainly be deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>But further; they have not mentioned one Inconvenience that will attend the ſaid Incorporation, ſo it muſt be done for them and</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. It is plain, the Corporation, if paſſed, will deſtroy Mr. <hi>Bellingham</hi>'s Patents and others, which have already been granted, to ſome Ingenious Artiſts, that have travelled, and ſpent much Money, and mightily improved the ſaid Manufacture in <hi>England,</hi> and to whom the pretended Incorporators are beholden for the very En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine they now Work withall; for they are in General called Glaſs-makers, without any Reſtriction, ad no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining Words after, can prevent their overthrowing a leſs powerfull than themſelves.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. They are not obliged to take into their Corpo-ration all Glaſs-makers that ſhall be willing to come into them.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. None muſt come in, without great Stocks, or if they doe, thoſe of the Corporation, who bring in Money only, will have as great a ſhare of the Profits, as any of the ſaid Artiſts, who bring in Money and Art too.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. The Thing plainly ſpeaks it ſelf to be a Corporation of Rich Men to oppreſs the Artiſts in the ſaid Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture, and will in Effect be a Monopoly, and engroſs that Commodity into a few Hands, and ſo raiſe the price of it, and frighten the Artiſts away.</p>
