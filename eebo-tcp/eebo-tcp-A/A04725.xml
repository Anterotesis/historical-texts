            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entlemen, being incouraged through your gentle acceptance of my <hi>Cynthia,</hi> I haue once more ventred on your curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies: hoping to find you (as I haue done heretofore) friendly. Being determined to writ of something, and yet not resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of anything, I considered with my selfe, if one should write of Loue (they will say) euerie one writes of Loue: if of vertue, why, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards vertue; To be short, I could thinke of nothing, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was common, or not at all in request. At length I bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoght my selfe of a Subiect, both new (as hauing neuer been written vpon before) and pleasing (as I thought) because Mans Nature commonlye) loues to heare that praised, with whose presence, he is most pleased.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Erasmus</hi> (the glory of Netherland, and the refiner of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Tongue) wrote a whole Booke, in <hi>the praise of follye.</hi> Then if so excellent a Scholler, writ in praise of vanity, why maye not I write in praise of that which is profitable? There are not two Countreys, where Gold is esteemed, lesse than in India, and more then in England: the reason is, because the Indians are barbarous, and our Nation ciuill.</p>
            <p>I haue giuen Pecunia the title of a Woman, Both for the termination of the Word, because (as Women are) shee is lou'd of men. The brauest voyages in the World, haue been made for Gold: for it, men haue ventured (by Sea) o the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest

partes of the earth: In the pursute whereof, Englandes Nestor and Neptune <hi>(Hawkins</hi> and Drake) lost their liues. vpon the Deaths of the which two, of the first I writ this:
<q>
                  <l>The Waters were his winding Sheete, the Sea was made his Toombe,</l>
                  <l>Yes for his Fame the Ocean Sea, was not sufficient roome.</l>
               </q>
Of the latter this:
<q>
                  <l>England his Hart, his Corps the Waters haue,</l>
                  <l>And that which raisd his Fame, became his graue.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The Praetorians (after the death of Pertinax) in the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a new Emperour, more esteemed the money of Iulia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, then either the vertue of Seuerus, or the valour of Pessen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nius. Then of what great estimation, this Lady Pecunia, both hath beene in the world, and is at this present, I leaue to your Iudgement. But what speak I so much of her praise in my Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, that haue commended her so at large, in my Booke; To the reading whereof, (Gentlemen) I refer you.</p>

               <l>(Breathing out Darknes) banisht cheerfull light,</l>
               <l>And sleepe (the shaddow of eternall rest)</l>
               <l>My seuerall sences, wholy had possest.</l>
               <l>When loe, there was presented to my view,</l>
               <l>A vision strange, yet not so strange, as true,</l>
               <l>Conscience (me thought) appeared vnto me,</l>
               <l>Cloth'd with good Deeds, with truth and Honesty,</l>
               <l>Her countenance demure, and sober sad,</l>
               <l>Nor any other Ornament she had.</l>
               <l>Then Couetousnesse did incounter her,</l>
               <l>Clad in a Cassock, like a Vsurer,</l>
               <l>The Cassock, it was made of poore men skinnes,</l>
               <l>Lac'd here and there, with many seuerall sinnes:</l>
               <l>Nor was it furd, with any common fur,</l>
