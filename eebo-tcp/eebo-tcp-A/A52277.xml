            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE <hi>Greek Manuscript,</hi> from which this Treatise is
translated, is in that part of the Publick Library at
<hi>Oxon,</hi> that is called the <hi>Baroccian;</hi> the CXLII<hi rend="sup">d</hi>
in number, according to the order those Books are set in at
present; where it may be seen by any, that either out of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity
may desire satisfaction; or have any Suspicion, that
the whole may be an Imposture, or any part of it an Interpolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
For as for the exactness and fidelity that has been used in
this <hi>English Interpretation,</hi> we appeal to the <hi>Original Greek;</hi>
which is now in the Press, and will speedily be published with
a <hi>Latin Version.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis very likely that this at <hi>Oxford</hi> is the only Copy of this
Book now remaining in the World. And that it should be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
till our Times, and yet hitherto be overlooked; and at
this very Juncture be taken notice of, and so opportunely brought
to light, seems to be more than a fortuitous Hit; it appears
to have something of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and a singular Providence in
it. God grant, it may have that good effect upon those unsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
persons of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> which so many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
and authorities of Antiquity (that Antiquity, which
they profess to imitate, and pretend to allege) may give us
reason to expect. Surely no uncharitable aspersions of Time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving,
courting Preferment, or the like, that might be
cast upon any that should write now in this Cause, can take
<pb facs="tcp:55409:4"/>
place against this Author, so remote from the present Age
and Controversie.</p>
            <p>'Tis pity we cannot know, whom we are obliged to for this
Excellent Tract. There's no Name prefixt before it; nor
any Characters in it, that may lead us to a probable conjecture
about the Author. But for his <hi>Age,</hi> without question he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<hi>CCCC</hi> Years ago: Seeing that the last History he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces,
is in the <hi>XII</hi> Century; and the latest Author he cites,
was in the beginning of the <hi>XIII.</hi> And as to his <hi>Authority</hi>
and <hi>Credit,</hi> though we need be less concerned about that,
because he relates every thing from the Testimonies of others;
and much more than is here said, may be easily made out from
approved and authentick Historians: yet He himself ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to have been no inconsiderable person, and, I believe,
no less than a <hi>Bishop.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That this Treatise was a <hi>Sermon,</hi> may be manifestly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
from two passages in the 18
<note n="*" place="margin">

                  </gap>, and, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> and 19 pages; where he addresses
himself to his <hi>Auditor,</hi> and not
his <hi>Reader.</hi> And the bulk of it
is agreeable to a Greek Homily. And that the Author li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
under the Jurisdiction of the See of <hi>Constantinople,</hi>
will be granted without difficulty; because he has confined
himself to the Histories in the Succession of those Patriarchs,
and from his own words, <hi>page 22. That from five</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinopolitan
<hi>Bishops the Ordinations of all the Clergy
were conveyed down to his time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The occasion of composing our MS. seems to have been this.
A Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople</hi> (right or wrong) was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
and another preferr'd to the See. Vpon this some
Friends and Dependants of the Deprived began to make a
Party, and stir up the people to a Schism: giving out, That
the former was still their genuine and Canonical Bishop;
<pb facs="tcp:55409:4"/>
that it was sinfull to have Communion with the New one;
and that all his Ordinations would be invalid. Whereupon
our Author, probably one of the Bishops that assisted at the
New Patriarch's Consecration (forty or fifty were often pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
on such occasions) one that had a tender concern for the
Peace of the Church, and was apprehensive of the sin and
danger of such a Separation, made this Historical Discourse
to the People, as 'tis credible, in the Cathedral Church of
<hi>Sophia;</hi> wherein he has included all the memorable and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel
examples, that had happen'd to that See within the
space of near a thousand years.</p>
            <p>He allows those Advocates for a Separation all that they
would have; he puts the case with all the advantage on that
side. Admit, that the deposed Bishop was unjustly depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
suppose, that the New one was uncanonically promoted:
even in these circumstances, if he was not a Heretick, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the People nor the ejected Patriarch himself ever refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Communion with him; the sufficience of his Ordinations
was never question'd by any Council; there was no Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
for Schism upon those accounts in all the History of the
Church; the Concord and Tranquillity and Prosperity of the
Whole were of more consideration in those Ages, than private
Interest or hidden Resentment, or the more tempting Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of being Head of a Party.</p>
            <p>God forbid, that the Case thus stated by our Author should
be thought parallel to that of our <hi>New Bishops;</hi> or that this
Book should be now publish'd, as if they needed that kind of
defence. But we propose and recommend our <hi>Treatise</hi> as an
Argumentation <hi>a fortiori.</hi> If in the cases of <hi>Unjust Depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi>
and <hi>Uncanonical Succession</hi> a Separation is without
Example in Ecclesiastical Story; how inexcusable will they
be, that shall make Faction and Schism, where neither of
those hard circumstances can be found?</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:55409:5"/>
As to the Exception of <hi>S. Chrysostom</hi>'s Case; which, it
seems, could not be comprehended in so short a Discourse, and
was put off therefore by our Author to a particular Disquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
which, if ever it was publish'd, is either lost or yet
undiscover'd: We must confess there was something singular
in the misfortune of that great and popular Man. The We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern
Churches did a long time refuse Communion with some
Bishops; that out of envy and malignity, by sinister inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations
and the falsest calumnies, deprived Him of the
See, and the Church of one of the best Prelates it ever had:
Those men they justly detested, as the actors and contrivers
of a good Patriarch's ruin: for

renouncing Communion was only, as it were, a breaking off a

This <hi>Meletius</hi> having formerly been made Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop

translated to the Throne of <hi>Antioch</hi> by the
Suffrages both of the Arians and Orthodox,
<hi>Eustathius [late Bishop of Sebastia]</hi> being yet

in banishment, was nevertheless because of his
Orthodoxy both accepted <hi>by</hi> and beneficial <hi>to</hi>

            <p>Now <hi>Chrysostome</hi> being call'd from <hi>Antioch,</hi>

was afterwards unjustly depos'd, and thrust

a Persecution against those that adher'd to
<hi>Chrysostome:</hi> and possessing the Patriarchate
20 years, was approved by the Church, both

who succeeded him; (unlawfully indeed, but
because he was an assertour of the Catholick Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
he was not rejected by the Church, neither
did <hi>Euthymius</hi> himself recede from his Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion)
and the third, <hi>Timotheus;</hi> who himself
likewise was unlawfully promoted in the room
of <hi>Macedonius:</hi> who yet was not rejected by
<hi>Macedonius,</hi> because he was a maintainer of

being troubled indeed at the ejectment

            <p>The same Emperour <hi>Anastasius</hi> deposed
and banished the said B. <hi>Elias</hi> from the See of
<hi>Jerusalem,</hi> because he would not come over to

in his place: whom, because he publickly
preach'd the Orthodox Belief. contrary to the
Emperour's Expectation, <hi>Elias</hi> in no wise re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55409:10"/>
and yet they communicated with <hi>John</hi> too,
(that sate then in the Throne of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi>)

               </note> Then <hi>Michael</hi> reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with his Mother <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora,</hi>
was, together with
her, corrupted, and was
therefore sharply reprov'd
by the holy <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and
excluded the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Church: <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>
therefore, being able

and establish'd <hi>Photi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
in his stead.</p>
            <p>After this came <hi>Basilius Macedo</hi> to the
Crown, and he presently deposes <hi>Photius,</hi> and
reestablishes <hi>Ignatius;</hi> but after the death of
<hi>Ignatius,</hi> he again restores <hi>Photius.</hi> Which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
is a thing to be wonder'd at. For if
<hi>Photius</hi> was depos'd as an Adulterer and Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of the Throne, how comes he again to be
promoted as innocent? But be it as it will,
the Church however receives and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
and honours them both, because Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox:
and thus she says <hi>(in her Diptychs)
May the memory of</hi> Ignatius, Photius, Stephanus,
<hi>and</hi> Antonius, <hi>the most holy Patriarchs, be ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting:

and whatsoever is spoken against</hi> Ignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,

<hi>the most holy Patriarchs, is an Anathema.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now let the <hi>Hearer</hi> observe again, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the holy <hi>Ignatius</hi> did not, because he was
unjustly thrust out of the See, either recede
from the Communion of <hi>Photius,</hi> or perswade
the People to do so. For this is the scope and
design of all the Histories that are here produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
To shew, that not one of all those Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs,
that were unjustly and uncanonically
thrust out of their proper Sees, did ever with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
himself from the Communion of his
Successor, or perswade the People to separate
from the Church; but that both they and the
People continued in Communion, if so be
their Successors were Orthodox.</p>
            <p>After this, <hi>Leo,</hi> the Son of <hi>Basilius,</hi> being
possess'd of the Imperial Sceptre, depriv'd that
orthodox Patriarch whom he found in the
See, and promoted <hi>Stephanus,</hi> his own Brother,
in his room; one that was sound indeed in the
Faith, but nevertheless was made Patriarch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Canons. But no Schism was made
in the Church upon that account. For <hi>Stepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
likewise was own'd and receiv'd by her. So
that thus she speaks <hi>(in her Diptychs) May the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55409:15"/>
memory of</hi> Ignatius, Photius <hi>and</hi> Stephanus, <hi>the
most holy Patriarchs, be everlasting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The same Emperor <hi>Leo,</hi> surnamed the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher,</hi>
ejected the most rightfull Patriarch
<hi>Nicolaus,</hi> a Man renowned for his Orthodoxy,
out of the See; because he refused to consent
to his fourth Marriage; and oppos'd him ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
in his design of making it lawfull to

that <hi>Isaacius</hi> reign'd he made five Patriarchs
successively: By whom, as must needs be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,
there were many persons ordain'd. And
from them the whole order of the Priesthood
and all the Church is brought down to our
days. And 'tis a matter of admiration, that
in the reign of that Emperor, five Patriarchs
succeeding one another, and all alive toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
should not separate from one anothers
Communion; because one was put in and
another was put out, purely at the Emperor's
pleasure.</p>
            <p>To conclude all in a word; One thing on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
was required by the Church, that the new
Bishop should profess the same (Orthodox)
Faith with the other that was depos'd; but
as for other Complaints and Accusations, that
ever and anon were made upon such Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions,
except it were Heresie, she never
made any strict examination into them.</p>
