         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But, if divided, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckly
omen of an approaching
storme, or unwellcome har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binger
of inevitable ruine. The
Romans were as carefull in
maintaining their Vestall fire,
as preserving the <hi>Palladium,</hi>
Counting that, no lesse than
this, a pledge of their Empires
durance and felicity. For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
it is not the <hi>Palladium</hi> or

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:93116:31"/>
wisdome, or Policy, that is
able to protect, or give a long
life to Empire, or Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
where the holy fire of
Religion is extinguished, which
will quickly ensue where the
Ministry is discouraged, who
like the order of Vesta's
Priestshood, should blow up the
Coles of Devotion, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
the sacred fire of zeal on
the Altars of the peoples hearts.
Magistrates and Ministers are
the Planets by whose influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and superintendency, God
hath appointed the elementary
and inferiour Bodies of Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
to be govern'd and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and that Common-Wealth
is blind to her own interest,
that doth not tender them as the
Apples of her eyes. For to speak
truth they are in the body poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
what the great luminaries
in the universe; the very light
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:93116:31"/>
and eyes of the world, of
which could the one without
the other be put out (as some
have fondly imagined) it must
needs render the body politick
as monstrous and prodigious, as
that of our Poets one-eyed <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemus;</hi>
But since these twins of
light kindl at each others flames,
and can neither be extinguish'd
without the other, nothing can
be expected from Eclisping the
Sun of eithers authority, but
a sad night of ignorance and
confusion. To conclude, that
Common-wealth cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to hear the sweet melody,
or be ravish'd with the Musick of
the Sphaers motions, where the
Orbs of Civill governments are
not moved by these Intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
The Ministers, therefore,
and States-men are under God
the two pillars that bear up the
Arke of Government; and they
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:93116:32"/>
that indeavour the subversion
of either (whatever may be
pretended) would open a door

for the least moment, deprive
it of all action and operation:
and therefore whensoever it is
vacant, from all externall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and disingag'd from all
other imployments; it retires
into the closet of its own
breast, and converses with
the family of its own thoughts:
which if train'd up in the

good thoughts; for thoughts
are the pictures of the minde
drawn by its own pencill. In

and limn's it's own effigies to
the life; they are the pulses, by

               <head>Of Death.</head>
               <p>WHat kind of Bug-bear
soever Death may be
represented, through
the Sophisticated Glasse of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
apprehensions, as that
he is the King of terrours,
the worme's Caterer, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
Sargeant, that arrests
poor mortalls, for the debt
due to corruption, and gives
checkmate not only to life's
pleasure, but also the pleasant
gaire of mans life; and may
therefore be term'd life's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourer,
the grand <hi>Anthropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phagus,</hi>
or man-eater, that as
it were cracks the shell of the
flesh for worms, himself preying
on the sweet kernell of the soul.
These and such like are the
black colours with which igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and guilt paynts a visard
and masks the face of death.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:93116:56"/>
Whereas could we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the truth, we should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
it as naturall to dye as to
be borne; Death being but the
souls breaking up of house, or
dismantling it self of the no
less cumbersom than dusty Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of flesh, or rather that
it is the goal of the souls race,
the palme of victory, the very
crown and reward of life.</p>
               <p>Death is not the Jaylor that
captivates, but the Herauld
that proclaimes liberty and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prievs
the soul from the confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and prison of its body:
that knocks off the Fetters and
Shackles of flesh, and gives it the
desired <hi>Exit</hi> from off the stage of
this trouble some world, the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veler
in the fable wishd for death
but quayling at his approach, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd
his hand to help him up w<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
his burthen; whereas death in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
him a greater courtesy, to
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:93116:57"/>
wit, the unloading his soul of
those heavy clods or earth, and
bundle of corruption it groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
under. Thus many stand in
their own light, and will not
suffer themselves to be befrien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
like the little Poet that
durst not put off his heavy shoes
left the wind, committing a
rape on his leight Body should
carry him away as the Eagle is
said to have done Ganymed:
thus loath are the most of men
that death should take off the
leaden shoes of their bodies,
notwithstanding they hinder
their souls flight into <hi>Elysi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Death is so far from being
the murderer of life, that it
rather hatches it by breaking up
the Shell of the body, in which
it was imprison'd or rather se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minally
conteyn'd: for as the
chicken or young fowle, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:93116:57"/>
from the egge; or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall

which nature had treasur'd it

                  </gap> our
lives from the ruines and ashes
of our bodies: Yea it's impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
the Sun of our true life
should shine forth in it's full
glory till the cloud of our flesh
be dissipated, which occasion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the wisest of Kings to say.
<hi>The day of a mans death is better
than the day of his birth.</hi> Which
according to <hi>Platoes</hi> Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
may be digested without a
comment: for if the glorious
lamp of the soul were thrust in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the dark lant-horn of its bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
by way of punishment for
crimes committed in her Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
estate, when shee had her
mansion among the Stars; then
certainly, when by death
she shall be return'd to her hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:93116:58"/>
socket, she is no way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd
but restor'd to her primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
lustre and glory.</p>
               <p>Such a notion as this (though
I confesse erroneous enough as
antedating the souls existency)
yet is of greater Analogy to
the immunities and priviledges
death puts the soul in possession
of, than those cloudy and dast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
apprehensions that most
Christians entertain thereof;
who in this, seem shorter sight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
than the Barbarous Scythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
who use to celebrate the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequies
of their nighest Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
more after the manner of
a triumph than a funerall, more
rightly accounting, that we
falsely terme the expiring of
of lives lease, the haven of rest,
the period of misery and souls
reprieve from the Captivity of
flesh; whereas their childrens
births they solemniz'd with all
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:93116:58"/>
expressions of grief and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
as fore-seeing the miseries
that usually accompany the
soules entrance on earths thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Nor did the <hi>Scythians</hi>
alone ingrosse this notion, for
other Heathens were also
Masters of it; witnesse the
facetious end of <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi>
who is reported to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
the fable of his life with
a consort of Musick and begg'd a
