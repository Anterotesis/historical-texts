            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
forth this little poore


<pb facs="tcp:27910:3"/>
Treatise in the name of
some vertuous and worthy
person, straitway you three
above-named came into my
minde, and I knew not how
to sever you, nor which I
could leave out, therefore
made bold rather to Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
it to you all together,
for these reasons: First, God
hath neerely joyned you
all together by many bonds,
both Civill and Religious,
both of Nature and Grace,
and hath given you to bee
all of one minde in the
Lord. I have also had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
great experience of
your love both to mee and
to my ministery, and am
much bound unto you all.
I thought it therefore meet
to render this as a small to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

unfained love and true
thankfulnesse to your Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships

a one of you but deserve to
beare the Name alone of a
farre better worke than this,
yet seeing as this is my first
fruits in this kinde, so I
know not, but its most like
to bee the last, therefore I
have beene thus bold to
joyne you all together, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
craving your accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of this poore mite.
And thus desiring to you
all, a principall portion of

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian Reader,
these things that
thou findest in
this little Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
of Faith, were
the summe of
sundry Sermons preacht in my or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
weeke-day Lecture, seven or
eight yeeres agoe, which I wrote
brokenly and briefly for my owne
memory, leaving out many things
that in the Vses &amp; Applications of
the points were delivered in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
which should set an edge upon
the doctrines delivered. I was reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
by some of the Auditors, when


<pb facs="tcp:27910:5"/>
I had finisht them in preaching, that
they might have them still at hand
for helpe of their memories, and
furthering of their profiting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by:
But I thought it a good mercy
of God to me, that I might doe his
Church some little service by prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
(wherein it hath pleased his
Majestie to give me some successe
and blessing, which is all I have to
rejoyce of in this world) and as
for printing, the knowledge of my
owne unfitnesse, and my want of
leisure made mee to refuse that
motion, and never to give my
minde to that worke. But now of
late a speciall godly friend by much
importunity drew my Notes from
me, and hath gotten them written
out (which I never could or would
doe) whose Copie when I had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>used,
I found things so shortly and
imperfectly set downe, as I much
desired it might have beene sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
still, but his strong perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
that it might bee of good use
to the poore people of God, in time


<pb facs="tcp:27910:5"/>
overcame mee: though thou shalt
finde it farre otherwise than I
would have had it if I had had lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to have revised it, or then if I
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ad yeelded to the first motion it
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ight have beene, for then when
things were fresh in minde, I could
with little more paines have set
them downe more fully and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
than now I can, or could if I had
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eysure by many degrees; neither
could I possibly in cold blood, and so
long after, call to minde or write
those stirring passages that God
brings to hand in the heate of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching.
Well, craving pardon for
all defects, I commit it to thy hand
as it is, humbly begging the Lords
blessing and good hand to goe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.
If any by the Excellency, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
and Rarenesse of this grace
of Faith shall bee provoked to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to be possessed of it, that are
as yet without it, and those that
have it to nourish it, that it may
encrease to the best degrees, and to
live by it to the glory of God, their


<pb facs="tcp:27910:6"/>
encrease of comfort here, and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
hereafter; I shall have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
my end, be heartily glad, and
give God thankes. If any reape a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
fruit hereby (as if they read it
advisedly, teachably, and with see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
God, I hope they shall) give
God the praise, and pray for the
Author, and for this crazed and
last part of his life.</p>
            <p>But let me advertise thee of one
thing, good Christian Reader, that
howsoever thou shalt often finde
in this Treatise, Faith spoken of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
of a particular perswasion of a
mans heart, that Christ Iesus is
his, and that hee shall be saved by
him, that yet it is not meant, that
that is the first act of Faith, which
is rather an accepting of Christ, a
leaning upon him, and a laying hold
on him offered by God; And then
after by a second act of Faith by
finding a true and unfamed change
of heart and life wrought in him,
hee is then and thereby perswaded
that hee is one of those that Christ


<pb facs="tcp:27910:6"/>
dyed for. Therefore this I take
to bee a good description of Faith;
That it is the mighty worke of the
holy Ghost, whereby a sinner hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
by the Law, and quite driven
out of himselfe, by or upon the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and sweet voyce of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
and the free and unpartiall
offer of mercy from God in Christ,
comes in time to cast himselfe upon
Christ, and trust to him as the All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient
and only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>anes of his
salvation, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> his dayes.
And to say that Faith is a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Application of Christ to a
mans owne soule, is a true and safe
definition thereof: for there be that
doe truly beleeve in Christ, and
that to salvation, if they should
then dye, that yet are not come to
bee perswaded that Christ is theirs;
which comes after, either by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of Gods Spirit, or the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of their owne spirit, from the
truth of their Sanctification.</p>
            <p>Having advertised thee of this,

herein, I will princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
insist upon these points
and heads which follow:</p>
            <p>1. What Faith is.</p>
            <p>2. The Author or chiefe efficient,
and by what means it is wrought
in us.</p>
            <p>3. The degrees of it.</p>
            <p>4. The excellency of it.</p>
            <p>5. The difficulty of it.</p>
            <p>6. The necessitie of it.</p>
            <p>7. The perpetuity of it, and that
true faith cannot bee wholly
lost.</p>
            <p>8. The signes and fruits whereby
it may be knowne.</p>
            <p>9. The lets and impediments of it,
which make it to bee of such
rarenesse.</p>
            <p>10. The contraries of it.</p>
            <p>And the Lord erable mee so
sufficiently to handle these

profitable and necessary.</p>
            <p>First I will shew what faith
is.<note place="margin">1. Faith what. 1.</note> This is needfull to bee well
cleered and handled as the
ground of all the other points
that follow. To which end I
will first distinguish it from
those things that are called faith
in Scripture, and bee not the
faith I am about, and from false
and unsufficient faiths, and so
shew what it is not first, and
then what it is.</p>
            <p>1. It is not our beleeving a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
mans word, or promise to
us, or mans writing, which is a
faith and confidence in him;
As if a great man should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise

is reckoned one, so
<hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 23.</p>
            <p>3. It is not the doctrine of
the Gospell, which yet is called
Faith <hi>Acts 6. 7. Gal.</hi> 1. 23. and
oft in the epistle to <hi>Timothy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. It is not a particular faith
of the lawfulnesse of this or
that to be done, as in things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,
of our liberty purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by Christ from the bondage
of the ceremoniall Law, which
in <hi>Pauls</hi> time some stronger
Christians beleeved, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
did eate any thing without
making conscience, and which
yet the weaker did not, but
made conscience still of them:
and now this is a faith to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
their liberty spoken of,
<hi>Rom. 14. hast thou faith?</hi> which
is not to bee understood either


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:27910:9"/>
of a generall faith, beleeving
the whole word of God, nor of
justifying faith, but of that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
liberty, and therefore he
bids them that have it, to keepe
it to themselves, at least for a
while, and not by words or
deeds to shew it forth to the
hurt of their weake bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.
Now the other faith
it is not meet we keepe it to
ourselves, but wee must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
with our mouthes, and be
ready ever to give account, and
also must shew forth the fruits
of it to the example of others.</p>
            <p>It is not historicall faith,<note place="margin">Historie. 1</note>
which is a beleeving, not of the
stories of the Bible onely to bee
true, but a beleeving of the
whole word of God, the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of the faith; but beleeved
onely in a historicall manner
generally, not applyed particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
to himselfe.</p>
            <p>To know the word of God
more or lesse of it, yea the


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:27910:10"/>
whole Scripture, and to give
assent that it is true, and goe no
further, is historicall faith, and
may bee in reprobates both
within the Church, as also in
such as be without the Church;

And therefore such a faith is
unable to save. But true faith
is this, and more, it addes par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
application of it to his

historicall onely is not true

rest; That there is a holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
Church, except I bee a
member of it; forgivenesse of
sinnes, resurrection to eternall
life, <hi>except I beleeve they belong
to mee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is confirmed by the
Lords ordinance of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
wherein <hi>he applieth Christ
to us in particular,</hi> and wills us
to appropriate him to our
selves. In the Lords Supper
God gives Christ under the


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:27910:21"/>
outward signes of Bread and
Wine; as if he should say, As ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilyas
I give thee this, so verily I
give thee my Son &amp; all his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits.
Now as every one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
takes the bread and
wine, eating and drinking the
same, so are men thereby
taught to reach out the hand of
Faith to take Christ home to
them.</p>
            <p>This serves for examination,<note place="margin">Vse.</note>
that every man may try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he have <hi>this particular assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi>
yea or no: if hee have, and
that well grounded, and so have
a true faith, herein he may bee
comforted.</p>
            <p>As for those that are not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
perswaded, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
no fruit or benefit by
Gods holy ordinances. Some
because prophanely they never
regarded any such thing, but
have spent their time about o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
matters, esteeming this as
a matter needlesse, or to be had


<pb n="30" facs="tcp:27910:22"/>
at pleasure; and therefore have
never thought of it: therefore
cause have they to bee ashamed
and awakened.</p>
            <p>Others have it not, because
they have sought it most lazily,
who now and then have beene
toucht with some little sight of
sinne and danger, and by the
provokings of the Gospell have
been moved sometimes, but as
soone goes out againe, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things put it by, and so
seeking coldly and by fits have
got nothing.</p>
            <p>If these had a lash or two
more of the Law (as they must
ere they will mend their pace)
it might doe well. But doe
men trifle about the weightiest
matters, and thinke they will
come alone or at leisure? Oh
let such remember that the
sloathfull hand maketh poore.</p>
            <p>Others have it not, because
they never seeke it, as suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
that it cannot be found, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:27910:22"/>
they thinke none can
know so much of Gods minde,
and that they be proud that say
so. These like Ratts bewray
themselves by their owne
noise, that they be no beleevers;
for Faith is a particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion:
and because they are
not assured, they would that no
body else should.</p>
            <p>Neither indeed can I tell how
they should, seeing they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
had their proud stomackes
pulled downe, to deny and goe
out of themselves with heavie
hearts for sinne, to seeke mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
nor have their proud hearts
stooped to Christs yoake and
government. But such must
come to another passe ere they
come by any assurance.</p>
            <p>What if they have none? yet
others who being meekned and
humbled, doe seek mercy with
broken hearts, and are willing
to stoope in all things, these
may and shall get assurance,


<pb n="32" facs="tcp:27910:23"/>
when such carnall worldlings
shall be cast out. They thinke it
impossible, but the impossibility
lyes in their proud stomackes,
if they would but come downe
as they ought, they should find
it possible, and should obtaine
it.</p>
            <p>Others are perswaded, yea
and fully too, that they shall be
saved, but if you aske them
how they came by it, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell. Such thinke that it is
sufficient to have goods, though
they cannot tell how they came
by them.</p>
            <p>Nor can they prove it, or
have any ground from Gods
Word, and yet they are so veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perswaded; but why? they
say they are not book-learned,
but all the towne cannot beate
them from it. But doe you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
and cannot prove it?
Some will say, because God is
mercifull. So God is just, and
will bee glorified in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:27910:23"/>
of all ignorant and
carelesse persons. Some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they have not been so bad
as many others, but carefull to
pay every man his owne, and to
doe no body wrong. A wofull
reason and rotten ground; if it
had beene quite contrary it had
beene much better to bee liked
of, seeing now they thinke to
be beholding to themselves for
Heaven; and publicans and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
shall goe to Heaven before
such proud Pharisees. Some
by their good repenting, never
having Christ in their eie. Some
more cunning, say they are sure
to be saved, and that by Christ,
and that he dyed for them, but
what promise in all the Gospell
doe they prove it from, or
ground upon, they cannot tell.</p>
            <p>But it may bee they will say,
Christ dyed for sinners: but I
am a sinner say they, therefore
he dyed for me.</p>
            <p>But Christ came not to dye


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:27910:24"/>
for all sinners; but for the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
broken in heart, penitent,
which these are very farre
from.</p>
            <p>But some I know, yea di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
in this company I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded,
have attained this true
and particular assurance, and
are able to prove how they
came by it, and by the fruits of
it can approve it. Let these be
thankefull for that they have,
and for all the meanes whereby
they came to it: and knowing
themselves to have such a lively
Faith as is necessary to salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
let this provoke them to
labour after the increase of
it by a constant use of all good
meanes, and godly watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and good conversation.</p>
            <p>And for those that yet have
not this perswasion, but seek it,
as the one needefull thing, let
them not bee dismaied, seeing
they are not wholly without it,
but let them continue, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:27910:24"/>
and in time they shall see
more.</p>
            <p>2. Next this confuteth the
tormenting doctrine of the
Church of Rome, that teacheth
that particular perswasion and
assurance of Gods love is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
pride and damnable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption,
and that men may
hope well but goe no further,
&amp; so hope, as yet they must still
be in doubt and feare, which
they count to bee a vertue in
our Faith to be mixt therewith,
which is a grosse thing, seeing
they are of the flesh, and the
unregenerate part, and wee are
bidden to beleeve, and not only
to hope well.</p>
            <p>They finding people in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of minde, doe hold them
in doubting, and by their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
leave them in desperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
because they teach them
not to looke for salvation by
the free mercy of God, and the
merits of Iesus. Christ, but


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:27910:25"/>
partly at least by their owne
workes; therefore they tell
them they must goe thus
farre a pilgrimage, and offer
to this and that Saint, lay
out thus much for Indulgences,
repaire such a Church, give
thus much to such a Cloyster<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>;
and doing thus they may bee in
good hope: and for the more
furety they must give money to
the Priests to say Masses and
Dirges for them, that if their
soules happen to goe to Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
they may be soone delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
And hereof it commeth
to passe, that they seeing their
sinnes many, and deserving cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
damnation, and their
workes imperfect, are ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
they have not done e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
&amp; so fall to despaire, the
proper fruit of this doctrine.</p>
            <p>But why do they thus teach?
onely for their owne gaine, to
fill their coffers, like unconsci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable
Chir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>gions, that set


<pb n="37" facs="tcp:27910:25"/>
forward a wound to day, and
backe tomorrow, and lay poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
things to it, making it a
grievons sore, to picke out the
more money, whereas they
could have healed it quickely,
but then they should have had
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut little mony.</p>
            <p>And as some Lawyer that
sets forward a mans cause in
Law, but after lets the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
have a vantage, that it
may bee the more difficult and
longer-lasting suite, and also
make the Clyent double the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ees, and yet it may bee lost at
last; so these, if they would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie
the right plaister at first,
should deale well: but then the
cure would bee too soone
wrought, and their kingdome
would come downe, as <hi>Gardner</hi>
said: If you open that doore
to the common people, then all
is gone. By this craft they
have their living, as <hi>Demetri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi>
said, <hi>Acts.</hi> 19.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:27910:26"/>
But let us thanke God that
wee are not under this woefull
bondage, in which men are
continued long in doubting,
and at last brought to utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire.
And let us whilest the
light of the Gospell lasteth, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
after the assurance of our
salvation; seeing if it bee dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ought after, it may as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredly
bee attained, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
by these reasons follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</p>
            <p>1. God bids us make it sure,
2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10. also. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5 and
therefore it may be done.</p>
            <p>2. If a man may know that
he beleeveth, then may hee bee
sure of his salvation; but a man
may know that, 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 3. For
though some thinke they have
it that have it not, yet this hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
not but that a true belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
may know. And as one
dreaming that hee is rich and is
not, hinders not but that hee
that is rich may know he is so:


<pb n="39" facs="tcp:27910:26"/>
so is it in this case.</p>
            <p>3. If a man may know that
he is sanctified, then hee may
know he shall be saved, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.
but this a man may know; for
though wee cannot perfectly
know our hearts, yet wee may,
so far as we may by the Word
of God discerne enough to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure us
of our sanctification.</p>
            <p>4. Also the Spirit of God
witnesseth to our spirits that
we are the Lords; that is, the
Spirit of truth, that knowes all
things, the deep things of God,
is of the privie Councell, and
of whose testimony no doubt
is to be made.</p>
            <p>5. Also if wee may have
peace toward God, yea peace
passing all understanding, yea
joy and that unspeakeable and
glorious, and be filled with joy
and peace in beleeving, as <hi>Rom.</hi>
15. then we may be assured of
our salvation: for can blinde
hope breed these? no, but


<pb n="40" facs="tcp:27910:27"/>
true assurance.</p>
            <p>6. If wee have entrance
with confidence into Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
as <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3. 12. then wee
may bee assured. But the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
is true, and therefore the
latter.</p>
            <p>But the Papists object,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> 1. It is presumption.
<hi>Ans.</hi> Yea, if we lookt for sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
by any thing in our
selves, but seeing we are assured
of it onely for Gods free mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and Christs merits, wholly
denying our selves, it is no
pride; the rather, because God
requires it of us: and therefore
it is rather pride in them, under
a colour of humility, to diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
Gods Commandements.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> 2. No mans name is in
the Scripture. <hi>Ans.</hi> But there
is better; for there is the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
nature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> 3. But the promises are
set downe generally or indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely,
not particularly to mee.


<pb n="41" facs="tcp:27910:27"/>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Wee may by a true and
sound reasoning make it good
to our selves, as in other things.
Every man is a reasonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Assumption. But I am a
man; therefore the conclusion
followeth necessarily.</p>
            <p>Thus we do from the general
propositions of the Law, inferre
particular conclusions. For how
know you you have deserved
hell? The Scripture saith, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
is every one that continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not in all things written in
the Booke, &amp;c. <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. 26.
But I have broken the Law;
therefore thus you conclude,
though your name be not there:
so may and ought we doe from
the Gospell. Who so beleeves
shall bee saved: but I beleeve,
therefore I shall be saved.</p>
            <p>So the weary, and laden, lost,
hungring, and such like, shall
have mercy. But I am so, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
&amp;c. This is more certaine
than if my name were in the
Bible.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:27910:28"/>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> 4. Wee are bidden to
worke out our salvation in
feare and trembling. <hi>Ans.</hi>
Not a slavish kinde of feare;
for we must serve him without
feare all the dayes of our life,
<hi>Luke</hi> 2. but a religious feare of
offending, which stands very
well with assurance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> 5. How can we be sure
of our salvation, when wee
know not whether wee shall
hold out to the end? such and
such have fallen, <hi>Saul, Salomon,
Iudas, Demas, David, Peter.</hi>
This shall be answered towards
the latter end of this tractate,
where I prove the Perpetuity
of Faith.</p>
            <p>It remaines therefore, for all
hath beene said to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that we may be particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
assured of our salvation, and
that this is true Faith. And
therefore let us labour for this
above all things, and not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
about it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:27910:28"/>
Thirdly this serveth to teach
and move alland every of us to
labour for this faith,<note place="margin">Vse 3.</note> and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
assurance; without
which there is no joy: and to
give no rest to God or our
selves till we have it. Seeke it,
and seeke it earnestly, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
such a jewell.</p>
            <p>Oh the folly and madnesse of
most people that can make a
life without this, but not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to be called a life: In death
you would be assured; but you
should seeke it now, or else ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
looke for it then, &amp;c. My
hearts desire is, that if it were
Gods will you might all prove
beleevers; I should be glad, but
you should have the benefit.
Some fruit I thanke God I
finde in this kinde now and
then, but oh that the rest would
come in, &amp;c. without this no
comfort in life or death, no
heart to any good dutie, no part
in Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:27910:29"/>
The second point propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
is concerning the author
and chiefe efficient of Faith,<note place="margin">2. Author and by what meanes.</note>
and the meanes whereby hee
worketh it in us. For the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
of Faith, it is God and
none other: first it is not Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
for then all should have it,
but 2 <hi>Thes. 3. All men have not
Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though many say they
have ever beleeved, and it was
borne with them, yet they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
themselves, and have no
true faith in them at all. Such
faith indeed as they have, may
be, and was borne with them
that is, a blinde presumptuons
conceit without ground.</p>
            <p>It is not natures. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 17.
flesh and blood have not revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
these things to thee, but our
Father which is in heaven.</p>
            <p>Wee have it not from our
parents <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 13.</p>
            <p>It is not onely not in our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
nature, but it was not in


<pb n="45" facs="tcp:27910:29"/>
the pure nature of <hi>Adam,</hi> who
beleeved in God, but not in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ. For it came in since
the fall that wee have need of a
Redeemer; and to be saved by
an other bodyes sufferings and
obedience is a supernaturall
thing, and hard to beleeve. To
the Grecians and wise men of
the world it is foolishnesse.
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 23.</p>
            <p>Nay wee are nothing apt to
it, nor able to thinke a good
thought; our heart is so bound
up in unbeliefe, and wee lockt
in the chaines of it, that except
God open the doore of the
heart as he did <hi>Lydia's,</hi> to see
and feele our sinnes, and the
wrath of God due thereby, we
despaire, and fly from God as

to shew us mercy, that had
no ability or preparation in us
thereto, but all opposition, as
much as they that bee furthest

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:27910:31"/>
had had the sight and burden
of our sinnes might have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaired

            <p>They that never knew what
sinne meant they can easily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
but they that have felt
the burden of sinne finde it

            <p>Wee should also make high
account of it both for the gift
and for the giver: a great King
gave it us, therefore nourish
and use it so well that hee may
give us more.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it serveth to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute

            <p>Men can neither worke it in
themselves, nor yet will beg it

so, they might have dyed

            <p>If wee have it not, then let us


<pb n="49" facs="tcp:27910:31"/>
labour with God in humility
for it in the use of the meanes,
and not trust to our selves, as
most doe, that goe on without
it, yea, knowing they have it
not, yet they goe on, as it were
in their power at their owne

as they <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. that neither un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood

canst, which is a thing required,
and though thou canst not do it

wanting to such desires: as our
Saviour Christ saith, whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

yea if you aske the holy


<pb n="50" facs="tcp:27910:32"/>

well but by the holy Ghost.</p>
            <p>The causes that move God
to worke Faith in any,<note place="margin">Causes.</note> is first
his free election; 2. The next
the merit of our Saviour Christ.
First his election, therefore
<hi>Act.</hi> 13. 48. so many as were
ordained to eternall life, belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
and hereof it is called
faith of Gods Elect. So our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
saith <hi>Ioh. 6. 37. All that
my Father hath given mee shall
come to me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God workes Faith in all his
Elect in due time, that live to
yeares of understanding: for
Infants, hee saves them by a
way no lesse wonderfull than
unknowne to us, by applying
Christ to them by his Spirit.</p>
            <p>But all that be of yeares hee
workes faith in them at one
time or other.</p>
            <p>It is not (as some imagine)
that children have faith
wrought in them at their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,


<pb n="51" facs="tcp:27910:32"/>
but afterwards.</p>
            <p>Wee have a marke of our
election when we come to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,<note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note>
and not before: they
therefore that have it, let them
rejoyee in it; they that have it
not, let them never bee quiet,
seeing tillthen, if they have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
under the meanes, they
carry the marke of a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.</p>
            <p>2. Wee must ascribe nothing
to our selves for our faith, but
to Gods free mercy, and
Christs merit, and bee thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to God in Christ Iesus
for it.</p>
            <p>The meanes whereby God
workes it,<note place="margin">Meanes.</note> is, The ministery of
his Word,<hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 17. the
which is therefore called the
arme of God, &amp; the power of
God to salvation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 16. the
word of Faith: see it in <hi>Act.</hi> 2.
37. <hi>Lydia, Acts 16. 1 Cor.</hi> 14.</p>
            <p>Even the ministery of the
Word by mortall man, not by


<pb n="52" facs="tcp:27910:33"/>
Angels, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. an Angell sends
<hi>Philip</hi> to the Eunuch, so bids
<hi>Cornelius</hi> send for <hi>Peter, Act.</hi> 10.</p>
            <p>It was our request that it
should be so, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. so God
granted it, and promised to
raise up a Prophet like <hi>Moses,</hi>
that is, Iesus Christ, like us in all
things execept sinne, and both
before and after him a successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Prophets, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 11.</p>
            <p>And this hee will have done
by plaine preaching in the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the Spirit, and power
of God, the plaine delivery of
the Word without the painted
eloquence of mens wisedome,
high &amp; stately phrase of speach.
And as he would not give <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
the victory in <hi>Sauls</hi> armour,
so hee will not let his ministers
prevaile with carnall weapons.
He would have Christ crucified
to be preached in a crucified
phrase.</p>
            <p>And therefore though this
seeme a homely and plaine way


<pb n="53" facs="tcp:27910:33"/>
for effecting such a thing, yet
seeing God hath sanctified it to
this end, it shall prevaile; as
the compassing and blowing of
the trumpets of Rams horns to
pull downe the walls of Iercho.</p>
            <p>This serveth to rebuke those
that either simply or under any
colour abase this ordinance,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> or
equall any other to it in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
much more if they prefer
any other thing before it: whom
the King will honour (as in the
story of <hi>Mordecay's</hi> advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
every man honours too;
so should it be, whom or what
God honoureth that should we.</p>
            <p>Some make reading equall,
and call that preaching. It is
true, it is a kinde of preaching,
taking the Word in a large
sense, as they that being healed,
publisht abroad what Christ
had done for them: but to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
with the ministery of the
Word, either publike reading
or private, is to abuse Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance.


<pb n="54" facs="tcp:27910:34"/>
It is not that which
God hath used or doth use to
the working, of Faith. And we
see by experience what fruite
comes of bare reading without
preaching. The Eunuch read
the Scripture himselfe, but was
never the neerer, till <hi>Philip</hi> prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
Iesus to him out of it,
<hi>Act.</hi> 8.35. So after the Lecture
of the Law and Prophets, the
people, say, If you have any
word of exhortation to the
people say on, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 15. so
our Saviour Christ, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. 17.
read a text, and then preached
out of it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it reproveth those
that under a colour of magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
prayer, would cry downe
the credit of preaching, as if
they might not stand together.
Yes, and be both of credit and
good use; and who makes more
conscience of prayer, than they
that are most painfull in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:27910:34"/>
But what prayer doe they
thus call for, when they say lesse
preaching and more praying?
not that most lively and forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
prayer which is conceived
by the helpe of Gods Spirit,
which many are more enemies
to, than to preaching, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracefully
abuse Gods holy
ordinance, and the gift of prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
by calling prayer conceived
extrumpery.</p>
            <p>True it is that there is a
place for set formes of prayer
in the Church, and of an anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
&amp; profitable use it is in the
Church of God: but by this
either to disgrace conceived
prayer, or to use so much set
prayer as should justle out the
preaching of the Word, none
of sound judgement and good
conscience will approve.</p>
            <p>This also teacheth us reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
to attend on it as Gods
ordinance, for working of
Faith, and to meete the Lord


<pb n="56" facs="tcp:27910:35"/>
where hee hath appointed. If
ever we shall have Faith it shall
bee by this meanes; attend at
wisedomes gates, and watch at
the posts.</p>
            <p>And therefore that we ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
tarry at home reading,
when we should be hearing the
Word preached; nor that wee
have oxen and farmes when
we be called to the Word, and
much lesse at the ale-house; nor
shift off and say, Oh if wee
might heare an Angell from
heaven, or see such miracles as
in former times, wee would
have beleeved; but this plaine
preaching by men that wee
know whence they are, is poor:
as the I fraelites did by Manna.
Oh falshood of mans heart; but
if they take no good by this,
then neither if one should rise
from the dead, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. Gods
ordinance carries force.</p>
            <p>3. Let us examine our selves
whether it hath been a word of


<pb n="57" facs="tcp:27910:35"/>
Faith to us or no, else we have
heard to small use. If it should
rain, &amp; the Sun shine on others
ground, &amp; make it fruitfull, and
not at all upon ours, wee would
thinke it a heavie punishment,
much more in this. If yea, then
it hath obtained the right end
in us; let us thanke God, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
it still for increase.</p>
            <p>Againe, if the Word be the
meanes of working Faith in us,
then the Ministers of God are
instruments in this businesse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
which is a great honour tou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
and should make us very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
And this also should
cause the people to reverence
Gods servants upon whom is
the holy annointing, and that
who so preacheth the Word
soundly and sincerely, they
should give them double ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and labour to make use of
their ministery; and to attend
upon it when they take paines,
though all things bee not to


<pb n="58" facs="tcp:27910:36"/>
their mind, 1.<hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 13.</p>
            <p>Now yet we must know it is
not the outward ministery of
the Word only,<note place="margin">The Spirit.</note> that is able to
worke Faith, but with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
working of the Spirit,
and it is that makes every part
of the Word effectuall. It is
neither the Ministers gifts, nor
the peoples aptnesse, wit or
good nature, but the worke of
Gods Spirit, <hi>Acts</hi> 11. The hand
of the Lord was with them:
so that, what is <hi>Paul,</hi> and what
is <hi>Apollo?</hi> They may plant and
water, but it is God that giveth
the increase. God, and not <hi>Paul</hi>
opened <hi>Lydia's</hi> heart. True it
is the Minister may helpe or
hinder, by the matter or maner
of his preaching, and his life.
If he preacheth such matter as
is fittest to worke Faith, if in a
zealous and good manner, and
live godly, this man is most like
to prevaile, rather than such as
shall teach truths, but not so


<pb n="59" facs="tcp:27910:36"/>
proper, or shall preach coldly
or girdingly at the better sort,
or flatteringly, or live disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely.
And this should teach
us not to trust to Ministers gifts,
or our owne wit, but to crave
the assistance of Gods Spirit,
every time we go to the Word.
The contrary is the cause of
little profiting. Pray him to
blesse the doctrine of the Law
to humble and throw you
downe, and the doctrine of the
Gospell to comfort againe in
due time, and to make every
point to be effectuall; without
which the Word shall bee a
sound in the eare, but vanish a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
without any impression.</p>
            <p>As the Anabaptists doe foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishly
on the one side, boasting
of great matters of Faith
wrought by the Spirit without
the Word: for, for the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of the Word they care
not, but have all by revelations;
whereas God workes both ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording


<pb n="60" facs="tcp:27910:37"/>
to his Word, and by
his Word, and not usually with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it, therefore they are vaine
delusions. So most among us
content our selves with the
Word, and never regard to
crave and looke for the inward
working of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> But why doe you will
us to pray to God for his Spirit
to worke with his Word? Is
our prayer like to prevaile? you
have taught us that without.
Faith there is no pleasing of
God, and that prayer is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
till we be beleevers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> True, I grant, one
without Faith cannot doe a
thing in the right manner plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to God, yet it is a thing
that God requires to attend
his Word, and to pray that his
Spirit may make it effectuall;
which if we doe not wee sinne
double, both by abiding in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe,
and disobeying Gods
commandement too.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:27910:37"/>
True also it is, that God is not
bound therefore to heare this
prayer, and worke grace in this
party, because he once made us
all happy; yet it is very likely
that God will heare it: hee can
pardon and passe by the faults
of the duety, and blesse the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
who useth to turne all to
the good of those hee meanes
good unto. He may heare his
prayer at least as hee heares the
yongue Ravens that cry, <hi>Iob</hi> 39.
So that the party reasons thus
with himselfe, or may, when
hee is tempted not to heare or
pray for a blessing, because it is
in vaine, and it is sinne: If I doe
not heare and pray, I am sure I
sinne, and so must needs perish,
but in seeking I know not
what God may doe for mee. As
the Lepers, 2. <hi>King.</hi> 7. that sate
without the gate of Samaria
ready to starve; If we stay here
we die, if we goe into the citie
(say they) there is nothing but


<pb n="62" facs="tcp:27910:38"/>
famine; but if wee goe to the
campe of the Aramites they
can but kill us, and wee cannot
tell whether they will or no. It
may be wee may finde some vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctualts,
or they may spare us,
wee may speede better than we
looke for: so here.</p>
            <p>Finally, let them know, that
whilest God worketh in them
earnest desires to pray and to
be heard, hee doth also at the
same time worke in them the
first degrees of true Faith, and
so accepteth of and heareth
their prayers according to his
gracious promise, although
they know not that Faith is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
begun in them; for this
is one fruit of Faith, to pray
fervently with an earnest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to have our suits granted.</p>
            <p>Now then let us consider
more patticularly, what part of
the Word of God serves to
worke Faith. And that is both
Law and Gospell, and the joynt


<pb n="63" facs="tcp:27910:38"/>
ministerie of them both; the
one preparing, the other effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
it by degrees.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> I doe not thinke but
God workes his Faith at once,
where it is without such steps:
And besides I observe how God
workes diversly in many, some
after one fashion, some an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> None can prove or shew
preside<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that faith was wrought
in an instant at first, without
any preparation going before:
nor can it bee conceived how a
man should beleeve in Christ
for salvation, that felt not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
himselfe in a miserable
state. But as the needle goes
before to pierce the cloath, and
makes way for the thred to sew
it: so is it in this case.</p>
            <p>I grant the Lord who is the
most free Agent, takes liberty,
and workes as it pleaseth him,
and there is oddes and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
for time, measure, and


<pb n="64" facs="tcp:27910:39"/>
such things, but for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
alwayes the same; by hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
first, then comforting,
and that by degrees: I speake
ordinarily.</p>
            <p>Therefore seeing by observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
his dealing with most, wee
may well say, that thus he doth
and will ordinarily worke with
those that he meanes effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to call and worke Faith in.
Though it may bee the parties
may not perceive every step by
which they are brought along,
yet it is so usually. True it is
that God humbleth some more,
some lesse, and so gives more
and speedier comfort to some
than to others: some extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
humbled, and yet but
weakely comforted; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise,
some meanely hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
and yet extraordinarily
comforted. But this is not usual.</p>
            <p>Some get up sooner a great
deale, and with small meanes
and helpes; some with many


<pb n="65" facs="tcp:27910:39"/>
more helpes, yet much adoe to
get comfort, or to be upheld.</p>
            <p>Yet this hinders not but it is
true, that God usually keepes an
order, and according to the
measure of the one is the other
which hee doth. And so wee
may propound it not to binde
the Lord, but our selves, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
ordinarily from him.</p>
            <p>Therefore we Ministers must
not separate the things God
hath joyned,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> but preach both
Law and Gospell.</p>
            <p>Yea magnifie the great wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and mercy of God that
hath left to his Church such a
ministery of both together,
without which there could be
no sound worke of grace
wrought in any.</p>
            <p>If the Law onely be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
its the way to terrifie, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and drive to despaire; if
the Gospell only, to make folks
licentious Christians, and to
looke for salvation by Christ


<pb n="66" facs="tcp:27910:40"/>
ere ever they know what neede
they have of him: and so to be
Christians by halves, and at
pleasure, and to break off when
they list, and at last to be never
the neere. If the Law teach
men, they must avoide this
sinne and do that duety, which
is the second use of the Law
that pertaines indeed to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate,
concealing the first
use of the Law: men will bee
doing as they can, and thinke
they doe very well, and yet de
ceive themselves; therefore
the Gospell comes and tells
them, without Faith it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to please God, and so
outs their combe againe: and
so both together doe wondrous
well, and make a sound Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
where they have their
working.</p>
            <p>Yea and that in order. The
Law first humbles, then the
Gospell comforts; the Law tels
us what to do, the Gospell that


<pb n="67" facs="tcp:27910:40"/>
we must do it in faith, or else it is
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n vaine.</p>
            <p>In the next place consider
how the Law and the Gospell
doe worke, first upon the head,
then upon the heart: first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighning
the minde, next wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
upon the will and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
as, The Law, with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
working of the Spirit
(without which no good is to
bee looked for) makes a man
see his misery. Secondly, by the
same Spirit it humbles a mans
heart, in the sight and sense of
it: So, the Gospell inlighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
the minde with know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the way of redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
Secondly, it workes upon
the heart to affect, seeke, prise
it, and at last to apprehend and
beleeve it: the latter is the
more difficult worke of the
two, the heart being more out
of frame than the understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
            <p>But let us more distinctly


<pb n="68" facs="tcp:27910:41"/>
consider of the severall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings
of Law and Gospell,<note place="margin">The Law his worke.</note> to,
and in the working of Faith:
first the Law, and it hath three
workes, 1. It enlighteneth the
sinner. 2. It convinceth him.
3. Raiseth up terrour in him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
But of this (in a word) bee sure,
that the Law workes no grace,
but onely prepares for it. A
man may have all that the Law
can worke, and yet bee a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate;
and yet the workings of
the Law could not be wanting:
it is a killing letter, the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of death and of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 1. 9.</p>
            <p>The Law enlighteneth a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
sinner, in whom God
hath a meaning to work Faith;
with a cleere and particular
sight of his misery, and wofull
state he stands in by sinne, and
makes him distinctly to see
these things: 1. His sinne (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at first created happy) that
hee hath wofully fallen from it,


<pb n="69" facs="tcp:27910:41"/>
and lost it, and wickedly rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
against so good a God. Next,
it tells him of his originall sin,
whereby as with a plague of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prosie
his whole nature, soule
and body, and every faculty of
them is tainted and poysoned.</p>
            <p>Then the wofull state of the
body, every member being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a weapon of unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and sinne, as the throate
an open sepulchre, the mouth
full of deceit, and so in the rest,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 13. 14. lame to any
good, as in the particulars.</p>
            <p>Not onely thus, but that as he
never did, so can never doe
ought but sinne, his corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
poysoning every action,
even the best that he doth, so as
he is not able to thinke a good
thought. But then it tells him
the other part of his miserie,
which is that that troubles
him else he would not bee stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
at all for his sinnes though
never so many; but the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment


<pb n="70" facs="tcp:27910:42"/>
is that that must trouble
him, not his sinne, as yet hee is
not come to that. For punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the Law tells him hee is
cursed, that is, subject to all evill
here and hereafter, and that
the wages of sinne is death the
first and the second, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners
of them both.</p>
            <p>But all the punishment of
this life, though cursed at
home, abroad, sitting, walking,
in himselfe, in his minde, body,
goods, name, though these bee
much, yet alas this is a heaven in
comparison of the hellish tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which hee must indu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
everlastingly in the world to
come.</p>
            <p>Next, the Law sheweth that
this party hath no way to helpe
himselfe out of this miserie by
any thing hee can doe, but doth
daily increase it.</p>
            <p>2. The Law also by the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the Spirit doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
the party that that is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly


<pb n="71" facs="tcp:27910:42"/>
true of him which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he used to post over his
head as pertaining to others
not to him; but now God
makes him take this to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
and to apply and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate
it as if the Minister
spoke to him alone by name;
and to thinke the Minister
knowes all his heart, looketh
on him, and speakes directly to
him, though it may bee the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
knew him not, or not his
case, but God makes him so to
thinke.</p>
            <p>3. Next, the Law raiseth terror
upon these two; and puts this
sinner out of his old secure
peaceable course of impeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
that hee went on in. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the prophane that went on
boldly in his sinne, or the civill
man trusting in his owne righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse;
the law drives him
out of those conceits, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifieth
him with feare, finding
himselfe in a most wofull state,


<pb n="72" facs="tcp:27910:43"/>
both by his innumerable sinnes,
and the infinite punishments
due thereby, and finding the
keeping of the Law impossible,
and the suffering the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
deserved intolerable; and
so this workes feare, and
makes him as one shot into the
flesh with a crosse or bearded
arrow, which he cannot shake
out, nor abide the smart, but
stamps as one stung with an
Adder, that cannot stand his
ground, but is wholly possessed
with f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>are.</p>
            <p>Hee findes his sinne as his ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recoverable
debt, his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
as an unpartiall accuser
and cruell laylor, himselfe a
prisoner, and a prison to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
Death a Sergeant to arrest
him, God a terrible Iudge, the
Law an Advocate to plead for
God against him, the Divell his
executioner, Hell the place of
his torment, where hee is to
endure endlesse, easelesse, and


<pb n="73" facs="tcp:27910:43"/>
remedilesse woe.</p>
            <p>Now this cannot but terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie,
though some more, some
lesse, as wee shall heare here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>And here by the way observe
a difference betweene naturall
terrour and this legall terrour:
That ariseth of some naturall
cause, or the worke of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell;
and some are so feared,
that they dare not be alone,
thinke they see ugly sights,<note place="margin">Naturall ter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> or.</note> and
night and day cannot sleepe.
Now this hath no disposition to
doe any good, but to drive men
from God rather; and such ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by wrestling outgrow it, or
by shifting place, or going to a
Physitian, or which is worse,
to a Wizzard.</p>
            <p>Indeed so God of his grace
may worke, as hee may fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the hands of some wise and
godly experienced man, that
may seeke to turne the streame,
and by laying open his spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all


<pb n="74" facs="tcp:27910:44"/>
miserie to drowne the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
and so it may come to le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall terrour,
and be an occasion
of good; though this is rare.</p>
            <p>But legall terrour is upon
the ground of the apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their sinne and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and is usually made by
God an occasion of much
good.</p>
            <p>Now though this legall ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
be oft an occasion of good,
yet it is not so necessarily, nor
ever, but an hypocrite and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate
may have it, yea a man
may have it and bee a divell,
and many wayes miscarry; as,
he may despaire as <hi>Iudas,</hi> or
weare it away as <hi>Cain</hi> by buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Cities, inventing Musicke,
and such conceits, still the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietnesse
of his conscience:
and (as many among us) by
drinking, gaming, merriments,
or much imployment in the
world, that hee may not heare
the inward din and noyse


<pb n="75" facs="tcp:27910:44"/>
within. As it was when they
offered their children to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech</hi>
in a brazen vessell hollow,
with fire under, they had some
playing with Tabrets, to drown
the noyse of the childrens cry:
so here.</p>
            <p>And some againe finding
themselves over-burthened by
the instigation of the divell,
that is ever at hand in such
times, doe throw it off, and fall
to their prophane course of all
dissolutenesse, and thinke, they
were best take their pleasures
while they may, seeing they
must be damned, and as good be
damned for somewhat as for
nothing, or a little. Indeed if
there were any hope, it were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
matter, but seeing there
is not, they will take their fill
And thus though they have not
committed the unpardonable
sinne, yet they cutting off them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
thus desperately, are in as
bad a case. And all this comes


<pb n="76" facs="tcp:27910:45"/>
on them as a punishment of
their former presumption,
whereby through the divells
perswasion they thought God
all of mercy, and that they
could have him at an houres
warning at any time, and could
please him with a call, and cold,
Lord have mercy. And now
they are as farre on the other
side ready to deny Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and power to save them, as
they did his justice before.</p>
            <p>So that wee see that legall
terrour is but a common gift.
All come not to it, but are shut
up in hardnesse of heart: and
though a man may have it and
bee lost, yet it is that that all
come not to. Sundry never
came so farre, were never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened,
or not convinced; or
if both, yet not terrified.
What, not though they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of all this woe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to them? No truly, such
is the impenitrable hardnesse


<pb n="77" facs="tcp:27910:45"/>
of the heart of man more than
an Adamant.</p>
            <p>Tell a man, all he hath is cast
away by sea or fire, and his
children slaine, it terrifieth and
amazeth him; but tell him of
worse things, hee is not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            <p>Tell a man hee is condemned
to die, it makes him (I meane
a guiltie person) at his wits
end, nay appalls him, and makes
him quake, but tell him hee is
condemned to eternall death,
hee is not affected with it.</p>
            <p>If you lay a load on a man
too heavie for him, presently he
sinkes under it, but yet hee can
stand up under the burthen of
hearing the everlasting wrath
of God for his infinite sinnes.</p>
            <p>Nay, bruite beasts bee terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by them that be too strong
for them: when the Lyon rores,
the beasts tremble; if a great
Mastiffe come running at a little
dog, he falls downe, and turnes


<pb n="78" facs="tcp:27910:46"/>
him on his backe, and holds up
his feet.</p>
            <p>Yea the insensible creatures,
the trees, plants, that hold their
colour, vigour, leaves and fruit
while the season is pleasant, yet
when cold frosts and nipping
windes come they yeelde, hang
head, and as it were confesse
they be overcome: onely mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
hard souled man is insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
as a stone at whatsoever
God can say or do. If the Lord
should smite a man in all the
parts of his body, strip him as
he did <hi>Iob</hi> of all the comforts of
this life at once, and make him
as he made him, <hi>Iob</hi> 33. yea
pull his skin over his eares, and
then preach the Law as terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
as hee did with thunder,
lightning, earthquakes, as on
Mount Sinai, hee might well
roare and bellow for paine,
and vexation, and curse God
to his face, as the divell said of
<hi>Iob,</hi> and blaspheme as those, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel.</hi>


               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:27910:46"/>
16. for the plagues; but yet
except the Lord shew them the
cause why, and the end hee
aymes at, hee would bee never
more moved for sinne and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
than the very stone
Men can heare the terrours of
the Law, and yet they shall bee
unto them but as the sound of
many waters, and as an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
sound. How long were the
Israelites hammered by trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
for their idolatry, ere they
would yeeld? So most among us,
like <hi>Ionah</hi> fall fast asleepe under
the hatches, when the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
are aloft at their wits end
crying. So many when others
are crying out, and wringing
their hands, and tearing their
haire, they are jolly and lusty,
that have as much cause; yea
wonder, nay stand and deride
such as milke-sops, and fools to
make such a stirre. Oh woefull
heart of man!</p>
            <p>Though the Lord bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming


<pb n="80" facs="tcp:27910:47"/>
de solation and destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
by his Law, yet they care
not, nor are moved, but say as
they, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. I shall doe well,
though I walk in the stubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of mine owne heart. Thus
men harden their hearts like
brasse-against all that can bee
said.</p>
            <p>Well, though some be never
terrified at all, but remain insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
blocks; and others terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
and yet miscarry, as wee
have heard, divers wayes, yet
hee in whom God will worke
Faith, shall safely faile between
these two rockes of insensible
blockishnesse, and desperate
madnesse or dissolutenesse: and
hee shall be terrified, and yet
God will keepe him secretly,
that hee shall neither despaire,
or doe himselfe hurt, which he
shall bee perswaded to bee the
worst way that can bee taken
and abhorre it, or at least shall
be preserved from it; nor shall


<pb n="81" facs="tcp:27910:47"/>
returne to his old course a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine:
and God will make him
distaste the temptation also. So
hee shall be humbled, and yet
take no hurt, but it shall in
time turne to his great good.</p>
            <p>Now yet further understand
that all taste not of the terrors
of the Law alike: some are ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
sodainely, and violently
it rusheth upon them; some
more leysurely and for a long
time, which may be as much as
that former, though it doe not
so seeme; as a little brooke
soone runnes over upon a little
dash of raine, and makes a
land-floud, when yet there is
more water in a great river,
though it keepes within the
bankes.</p>
            <p>Some have lived in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
&amp; a dissolute life without
the meanes; these be oft at the
hearing of the Law exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
smitten, and not having
knowledge of the Gospell to


<pb n="82" facs="tcp:27910:48"/>
looke to, are more sorely and
longer terrified. Some others
have beene brought up under
meanes, and have had know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and have bin brought up
innocently from grosse evils, &amp;
used to prayer and good exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises,
and lived with them that
loved good Preachers, these are
oft more insensibly wrought
upon by the Law, because both
Law and Gospell wrought toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at leisure, and being smit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
they could look to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
and somewhat help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
These also are sooner ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
downe than the former, in
whom sinne is deepely rooted.
As some Hankes which bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
after they have flowne, and
have caught the prey for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
these cost a wonderfull
toile to bring them to be tame,
and handsome, haggard things:
some others taken out of the
nest, which howsoever they
have a wilde nature, yet being


<pb n="83" facs="tcp:27910:48"/>
taken in time, so yongue, are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silier
brought to hand.</p>
            <p>Yet further know, some
which bee innocent and free
from grosse sinnes as any, and
of good knowledge, yet have
beene wonderfully tormented,
and long held under, when ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of bad life have got comfort
in farre lesse time, and with
lesse terrour by much; either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they be of a more fearfull
nature, or else have much me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
joyned withall; God
so disposing it, wee see so it is:
which may bee to shew us that
the least sinne whatsoever, seene
in the kinde with the desert of
it, is enough to cast us downe.</p>
            <p>Some deeply weigh the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
they are in, and are troubled
at it, yet so as they can keepe it
in, and beare it till God send
comfort which they seeke in
the meanes.</p>
            <p>Some are so wonderfully ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
as they quake &amp; tremble,


<pb n="84" facs="tcp:27910:49"/>
fall from meate, cannot sleepe,
looke pale, have bellies like
barrells, roll and tumble,
and have great trouble in the
body thereby, thinking that all
creatures witnesse against
them; if they see the fire, it
puts them strongly in minde of
hell fire, and therefore cannot
abide to see it, if great winde,
they feare it will blow downe
the house on them, and send
them to hell: if thunder and
lightening, they quake, and
feare, and cannot be pacified.</p>
            <p>Some dare not eate for feare
of being choakt, or because
they be unworthy, and shall but
increase their condemnation;
care not how they goe in appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell
but for very shame; thinke
the Divell is ready to carry
them away if they bee in the
darke; thinke hee pulled them
by the coate, feare to die, lest
they goe speedily to hell: think
they feele a fire within them.


<pb n="85" facs="tcp:27910:49"/>
Thus some by melancholy and
the temptation of Sathan, have
beene in a wofull case long, and
yet doe well at last.</p>
            <p>Some goe longer under their
burthen, because they keepe it
to themselves for shame or
bashfulnesse, till their backe is
ready to burst with keeping the
divells counsell. Some others
breake their minde to some
wise and faithfull friend, and
so get out sooner by much.
Now further, know that God
in this worke of terrour, raiseth
it upon sight of some one or
few sinnes most hainous either
in nature and qualitie, or else
by some circumstances aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated:
this more lies upon their
conscience, and torments them
rather than all their sinnes.</p>
            <p>As you shall see if a man goe
over the whole Law, hee will
be more stricken at the denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation
of Gods judgements a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
some one sinne, than


<pb n="86" facs="tcp:27910:50"/>
against all the breaches of the
whole Law together. As <hi>Act. 2.
Peter</hi> laid to their charge, and
they were terrified for crucify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Christ: they had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
many other, but this was in
their eye. As if a Master will
convince his servant; he will not
bring a number of smaller ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations
against him, which
might make him finde out ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses
and shifts, but some one
foule thing that he cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
thus to make him hang his
head: so God layeth to their
charge some speciall foule
sinne, that they may be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
and yet but one, or few.</p>
            <p>And this the Lord doth of
purpose that the party should
not be swallowed up; for if hee
should see all his sinnes as ugly
as hee sees some one, hee were
not able to beare it: therefore
God tempering mercy with ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
doth thus; for ayming not
at the parties hurt but good,


<pb n="87" facs="tcp:27910:50"/>
God lets him see but some so
as he may beare it.</p>
            <p>Now let us see some reasons
why the Lord thus terrifieth
them whom hee will bring to
comfort and faith.</p>
            <p>1. First,<note place="margin">Reasons of this terror.</note> that hee might
boare through by his Spirit an
eare into our heart to receive
instruction, without which we
should bee as unfit to receive
any, as the Merchants waxe to
receive any impression of the
seale till it bee melted. God
speakes once or twice and man
heares not, till he bring him to
that passe that is spoken of <hi>Iob</hi>
33. For till then, tell this sinner
that he must lay away his lusts,
his old delights, and sweet sins,
and take up a course of godly
life; and you may as good
thinke to have a wilde haggard
Hauke to flye and kill the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge,
and come to your hand
againe: or a Colt of foure or
five yeares old, fat, and never


<pb n="88" facs="tcp:27910:51"/>
handled, to draw quietly in the
furrow, or a wilde Bull, or the
Vnicorne of which God speaks
in <hi>Iob.</hi> Hee will scarce give you
the hearing of any such thing,
or if he doe, he will doe as hee
list for all that; hee snuffes like
the wilde Asse, <hi>Ier.</hi> 2. none will
trouble themselves about her,
but take her in her mouth: so
God takes this Asse in his
mouth, when hee is well laden
with the heavie hand of God
upon him; else you were as
good speake to the walls as to
him. But when the party is
thus tamed and taken downe,
then there is some speaking to
him, as <hi>Paul, Lord, vvhat wilt
thou have mee to doe?</hi> when he
was smitten downe; so the Iay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,
a desperate wretch and
cruell person, yet taken downe
by the earthquake, and <hi>Paul</hi> and
<hi>Silas</hi> his preaching; oh then
<hi>vvhat shall I doe to bee saved?</hi> so
they, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 37. whereas if


<pb n="89" facs="tcp:27910:51"/>
you had spoken unto them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in their jollity and pompe,
and when they were at ease,
and had what they would at
will, you might as soone have
catcht a Hare with a Tabor as
prevailed with them.</p>
            <p>And herein the Lord tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
his dealing diversly accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to peoples dispositions;
for as some children will need
more stripes than some, and the
wise parents deale accordingly,
so some by one Sermon of the
Law thundered out, or some
small affliction, are so pulled
downe as they cry out they be
damned, they bee utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,
none so vile as they, no
mercy for them, and can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bee kept from sinking. Some
others bee not so much cast
downe at three hundred Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.
And why? some will shift
from the hand of God; and
hearing the Word, and being
terrified, they will come no


<pb n="90" facs="tcp:27910:52"/>
more there a good while, and
others will wrastle with the
terrors and beare them out, and
resist them, and will not yeelde
nor blancke for them, lest they
should seeme to lose the credit
of the field. Well, these must
have the more hammering
when they thus resist, and if
God have no favour towards
them, it shall be sufficient, hee
will give them over and say,
you shall never be so well offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
againe, or else he will fasten
more judgements on them to
their destruction, as <hi>Ier.</hi> 28. 17.</p>
            <p>But if God have a favour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them, and purpose their
good, then all their striving
shall doe them no good, no
kicking against the prick, God
will lay on more load, terror
upon terror, trouble upon trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
till hee have bound him
hand and foote and made him
tame: he will make him yeeld
ere he have done with him. And


<pb n="91" facs="tcp:27910:52"/>
if he put the Lord to all this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse,
and himselfe to so much
trouble, he may thanke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
hee might have spared
some of it, if he had beene
handsommer and more tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
God would have spared
himselfe some of this labour,
and him some of this trouble,
if that which he would have
done could have beene done
without it. And yet herein God
is very merciful to this party in
laying all this load on him, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there is no remedy, rather
than that he should remaine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible,
seeing so he should
have gone sleeping to destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, the Lord thus
terrifieth us to make us truely
thankefull to him for our deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance,
without which terror
the proud lordly heart of man
would never be; but either set
light by Christ, or never give
God that thankes that hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served


<pb n="92" facs="tcp:27910:53"/>
for such a mercy. But
when we are brought to hells
mouth, and have no hope of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance,
but feare of certaine
damnation, if then the Lord,
beyond, yea contrary to expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
doth shew mercy and
release; oh this makes us
thankfull, and to tell what God
hath done for us, and to say,
this is worthy to bee written
with a pen of iron, in the table
of our heart never to bee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.</p>
            <p>So that God by this terror
doth but make matter for a
song of thankesgiving against
the time when this poore crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
shall bee able to endite it,
which shall be afterward.</p>
            <p>Now as men live to bestow
their favours on them that bee
in great neede or in a straight,
because they will ever remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
it, as a poore man redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
out of prison for debt: and
as a hungry man will be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full


<pb n="93" facs="tcp:27910:53"/>
for meate; the sicke for a
Physitian, (For what cares a
full stomacke for a hony combe,
whereas to the hungry every
bitter thing is sweet:) so is it in
this case betweene God and
us.</p>
            <p>And thus howsoever wee
would thinke no good, could
come out of such a confusion
and wofull terrour in the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
heart, (as indeed no more
there would, but rather it
would drive men to despaire, or
to fly against God, if God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
were not the worker in it)
yet he that brought light out
of darkenesse, brings order out
of confusion, and good out of
evill by this,</p>
            <p>And thus God deales rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
first with those with whom
after he will deale mildely and
mercifully, as <hi>Elisha. 2 Reg.</hi> 6.
did bid them handle the noble
man roughly at the doore, yet
after told him of plenty, so at


<pb n="94" facs="tcp:27910:54"/>
the doore and entrance God
deales harshly, but afterward
mildely. And as <hi>Ioseph</hi> at first
handled his brothers roughly,
called them Spies, put one in
prison, though of no ill minde,
but afterwards wept over
them, feasted them, yea, and
sent Chariots for them, and kept
them and theirs all their dayes;
so deales the Lord at first with
those whom yet afterwards he
weepes ouer, and feasts here
with comfort, and hereafter in
his heavenly kingdome.</p>
            <p>And as <hi>Eliah</hi> was prepared by
a whirle-winde and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake
to heare a still voyce, so
wee by the terrible voyce of
the Law, to heare the sweet
voyce of the Gospell.<note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The first use of this is to
move and perswade us Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
that wee preach the Law
to the people,<note place="margin">Of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses &amp; rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons why the Law must bee preached.</note> open the ten
Commandements, shew people
their misery, then Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments


<pb n="95" facs="tcp:27910:54"/>
against sinne and sinners,
to humble them and prepare
them for God. Not that wee
ought to preach that onely, for
so doth none of any understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
but that wee preach not
the Gospell, alone which is no
lesse absurd; to heale where
was no wound, and comfort
them that bee too proud and
jolly already. This is to sow
pillows and to cry peace, peace,
when there is no peace, and to
daube with untempered mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Wee must not affect a bare
title to be ministers of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
only; though indeed we be
so called from the more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
part of our ministery, but
wee must so preach the Gospell
as that wee doe not in the
meane while leave out the
Law. For the Law though it
worke no grace, yet it makes
way for it, as the needle sowes
not the cloth but makes way
for the threed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:27910:55"/>
As the time of the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were the dayes of the
Law, yet the Gospell was
taught then; for in all the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
was Law and Gospell,
so now in the dayes of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
must the Law be preached,
though not as the principall.</p>
            <p>Else wee shall never make
sound and true Christians, but
carnall and loose Gospellers.
The Gospell preached without
the Law, is cause of so many
wanton professors that talke of
Christ and the Gospell, but live
as they list. Let none feare it
will drive the people to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire;
seeing there is no such
mooving in these dayes, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the people bee like the
Smithes dog, who can lie under
the hammers noyse, and the
sparkes flying, and yet fast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleepe.
Besides, God usually
brings it to good: and if any
should miscarry, it is but such
as would have perished though


<pb n="97" facs="tcp:27910:55"/>
there had beene some other
course taken in preaching to
them. And let none speake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them preaching of the
Law, for it is the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> some
way that God himselfe; and his
servants in all ages have taken:
hee did reprove, convince, and
curse <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> and after
hee preached; The seed of the
woman shall breake the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents

As God prepared <hi>Eliah</hi> by

to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eave the soft voyce,

of God had visions terrible to
abase them ere he told them his

God had need that such a
course should bee taken with
them, then what need had they,
that were never <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>umbled?</p>
            <p>So <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptist dealt with

2. 37. first preached the Law,
and after the Gospell. So <hi>Paul</hi>
and <hi>Silas, Act.</hi> 16. The contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
is the way to make people
curse us hereafter, though it
please them for the present; As
if one should heale a sore on

draw and care out the inward
core, it would within a while
breake out againe with farre
greater danger: so shall we finde
it in this case.</p>
            <p>To the people the use is,<note place="margin">Vse. 2.</note> that
they examine whether ever
they felt the terrours of the
Law, of which we have spoken,
as wee see they must that come
to faith. And here bee three
sorts of persons to be spoken to.
First, such as never knew what
any such worke meant. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
such as have beene under
terrour, but haue outgrowne it.
Thirdly, such as yet lye under it.
I must speake to all these.</p>
            <p>I aske the most, did you ever


<pb n="99" facs="tcp:27910:56"/>
feele your selves in a fearefull
estate, and were you ever dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted
and terrified about the
same? Alas, the most part will
say, they know no such matter,
nor what it meanes, nay, some
thinke they would bee loth to
be in any such case, as they have
seene some to bee.</p>
            <p>Well, what is the reason thou
never wert troubled at thy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state?
Is it because thou wert
never inlightened to know the
particulars,<note place="margin">Such as were never terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</note> and depth of thy
misery? It may bee; For some
are ignorant indeed, and know
it not, or onely a little in
generall, that they bee sinners;
but of the depth, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
of their wofull estate they
are not advised. Well, if it bee
for want of being enlightened,
then know it now, and the
Lord enlighten thee. And to
this end informe thy selfe of
the depth of misery, in which
all mankinde lye by nature, till


<pb n="100" facs="tcp:27910:57"/>
by grace they be recovered out
of it.</p>
            <p>Or is it because thou went
not convinced, that it is thy
state, but hast knowne it only in
generall, and so posted it over
to others; and hast either not
thought it true of thee, or never
weighed it with thy selfe? If
thou hast not beene convinced,
then now be, and the Lord con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
thee. To which end I
speake to every one, rich, poor,
man, woman, yongue, old; if
thou beest one of the sonnes of
<hi>Adam,</hi> thou art in this woe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
state, and it is as true of
thee, as of any other in the
world.</p>
            <p>Or hast thou been enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and convinced, and yet
dost not feare? hast thou been
stricken downe about it, and
yet art not, humbled? thou hast
an obstinate, hard, and sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
heart indeede. Will not
the hearing of all this sinne,


<pb n="101" facs="tcp:27910:57"/>
and of all these plagues, and of
the eternall wrath of the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
God; will not, I say, all this
terrifie thee? If one should
tell thee all thou hast is burnt,
and thy children killed, this
would amaze thee, and take up
thy thoughts; or that thou art
condemned to die: and will
not this that thou art thus and
thus guilty, and in danger of all
the curses in the booke of the
Law; and that if thou shouldest
die to night thou shouldest first
to hell for ever: will not this
terrifie thee? The brute crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
will condemne thee; for
if they see themselves over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matcht
they fall downe and
feare: if the Lyon roares the
beasts tremble; but if the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
God of the whole world
roare, wilt not thou a poore
mortall creature, a worme, bee
affraid?</p>
            <p>Heathen <hi>Felix</hi> shall rise up
in judgement against thee, who


<pb n="102" facs="tcp:27910:58"/>
trembled at the preaching of
<hi>Paul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea wicked reprobate <hi>Iudas</hi>
shall; nay the Divells them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
for they tremble.</p>
            <p>God will put terrour into
thine insensible conscience ere
he have done with thee; or else
if the terrours of the Law can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
waken thee, the torments
of hell shall.</p>
            <p>O fearfull case, that the Law
being so preached as it is (and
yet oh that it were more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and zealously preached than
it is) that so few are moved at
it! Alas no; people are jolly,
lusty, and stout, they doe not
meane to blanke nor yeeld, but
harden their hearts and goe on
boldly &amp; lustily, as if they had
no cause to hang the head.</p>
            <p>Well, the Lord will pull
downe your proud lookes if
you belong to him, and make
your hearts heavier, or else you
shall never have part in his
comforts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:27910:58"/>
Is there not cause enough to
make thy stout heart to yeeld?
thinke of thy sinnes, of that
thou deserves hereby, think of
hell torments; the eternity of
them; that there bee sundry in
hell not halfe so great sinners
as thou, and that if thou shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
die to night thou shouldst
goe thither also.</p>
            <p>And pray God that hee that
made thy heart would worke
upon it, and shake it; and that
by his Law, as upon them, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.
37. and throw thee downe as
he did <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 9.</p>
            <p>Yet I will give thee leave
thus to doe, begge of God that
he would so shew thee thy sins
and punishment, not as hee
could, but as thou maiest be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to beare.</p>
            <p>Next there are some will say,
they have felt terrour of their
estate, but they have outgrown
it,<note place="margin">Such as havs out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>growne it.</note> it is past: Yea? What have
you done with it? have you


<pb n="104" facs="tcp:27910:59"/>
broke prison, or did God let you
out? If you have broke prison,
you must even in again; and that
worse than before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but if God
have let you out, well and good;
but how prove you that? This
you may know by considering
the manner how God brings
his from terrour to comfort
in the person of this party or kind
of parties that wee are now in
hand with; even good Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
who have had their terror
turned into comfort, which
they would not part with for
the world. Why if it be thus
that you have got out, God
forbid that I or any living
should dare to speak against it.
It is of God, and no marvell;
for hee aimed at no other at
first: his meaning was not
when hee cast thee downe at
first to destroy thee, but to
make thee fit to seeke comfort,
and then to bestow it upon
thee: therefore this is no new


<pb n="105" facs="tcp:27910:59"/>
thing, for he doth thus by all
his.</p>
            <p>And if this be your case, it
ought to stirre you up to great
thankfulnesse for this wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
mercy of God: for he hath
done much to guid you safely to
this passe through so many dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers:
for you might have been
left in senslesse blockishnesse
and perisht, and you have scapt
that. In thy terrour thou
mightest have fallen to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire,
or to drive it away un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely,
and so have perisht:
thou hast scaped that too. Yea,
when thou camest to seek help,
thou mightst have sought and
lost; but God hath blest thee
through all these, and brought
thee to peace, blessed bee the
Lord, seeing many have peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
in the way to this, that
thou art come to.</p>
            <p>No doubt in thy first begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to beleeve and after thy
obtaining, thou thoughtst thou


<pb n="106" facs="tcp:27910:60"/>
couldst not bee thankefull e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to God, and now beware
thou be not carelesse, forgetfull,
or fall from thy first love: hold
on in a course of thankfulnesse
and holy obedience, that thou
maiest still enjoy thy comfort.
Also bee carefull to helpe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
by the same comforts that
thou hast felt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> Yet sometimes I feare
I got comfort too soone, and
was not humbled sufficiently.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> If thou hadst loade
enough to weary thee out of
thy selfe, and not to leave till
thou soughtest and foundst
Christ, it was sufficient, thanke
God that thou wert not pressed
as God could have pressed
thee.</p>
            <p>Now for the others that
have broke prison; some have
got out of their terror by stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
against it, as, eyther they
have drunke it away, or plaid
it away: and if this be your case,


<pb n="107" facs="tcp:27910:60"/>
then the more foole you, thou
hast provided very ill for thy
selfe. Doest thou thinke these
terrours will bee consumed so,
or will bee answered so? Is the
debt ever the more paide, for
making the Bayliffe drunken?
The Creditor will set on thee
againe. Or it may be thou wilt
never againe come to the like
offer; God was beginning to
come neere thee, and thou wert
somewhat beginning to come
toward the way to Heaven: oh
if thou hadst followed it, and
strook while the iron was hot,
who knoweth what it might
have come to? but thou hast
quencht it, and so thou wilt be
harder to worke upon than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
before.</p>
            <p>All the counsell I can give
thee, is to call after these ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
which thou hast sought to
drive away, and call aloud ere
they be gone past call; and call
quickly ere thy heart be harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned


<pb n="108" facs="tcp:27910:61"/>
quite, and then it will cost
double labour. And pray God to
worke them upon thy heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>
            <p>Others have outgrowne
them, by snatching hold of the
promise of mercy and salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ere it belonged to them,
thinking themselves good
Christians, because they had
felt some terrors: but alas,
herein quite deceived; for then
<hi>Iudas</hi> was a good Christian,
and the Divells themselves. No,
the promise of salvation is not
straight belonging to one ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
in conscience, but to one
that is not onely terrified for
his punishment, but is contrite
hearted for sinne, which is the
worke of the Gospell.</p>
            <p>There hee many steppes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
terrour wrought by the
Law, and beleeving pardon of
sinnes. It is too long a study at
once, as will appeare in hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the Gospels working.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:27910:61"/>
These terrours if they had
continued till they had beene
turned to forrow and compun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of heart for sinne, it had
beene well.</p>
            <p>These must either come back
againe, or else trust to a false
perswasion and perish: they
must learne to step one step af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
another according to Gods
word.</p>
            <p>Yet it may be thou shalt finde
it harder the second time than
before, as they that breake pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
are laid in surer next time.</p>
            <p>The third sort are they
which are still under the Iron
harrow.</p>
            <p>To these I say,<note place="margin">Such as are still under ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and the spirit of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.</note> let them
know, this is somewhat, and in
preparation to more; blesse the
fire that melted thee, and kisse
the scourge that humbled thee;
thou mightst have beene left a
blocke: Know this is the Lords
discipline and course hee takes
with his.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:27910:62"/>
And let not these be weary of
the yoke of God and the Law,
and make overmuch haste out
of this state, for so may they
undoe themselves: for, as some
withstanding their terror have
withstood their salvation; so
some have by hastening out
made waste of all, and being
impatient of being in this case,
and overwilling to catch hold
of the Promise straight, have
proved but loose, unsound, and
unsavoury Christians in time,
which if they had tarried the
Lords leysure in it, might have
come to sound and true com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
which would have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
all their dayes.</p>
            <p>As some youths impatient of
service will not serve out their
time, but buy out two or three,
or foure yeares of their time,
and so comming to themselves,
and setting up ere they have
stayednesse or skill, they soone
waste away their stocke, and


<pb n="111" facs="tcp:27910:62"/>
then are faine seven yeares af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to come and bee a servant
with their old Master or some
other, which if they had served
out their time, might have bin
free men long agoe, and lived
in as good sort as their Masters;
So these must after long decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
themselves, either come
backe againe under the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
of the Law, and begin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
or else after their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound
and unsavoury course
ended, must perish, who might
have beene free men, and had
much true comfort long agoe,
and beene able to comfort o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
if they had not beene
too hastie. Or as an impatient
patient, gets the Chirurgion to
pull out the tent and corrasive,
or pulls it off himselfe as soone
as it begins to smart a little, and
so thinkes it is searcht enough,
and now layes on healing plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.
But afterwards this
breakes out againe worse then


<pb n="112" facs="tcp:27910:63"/>
ever; whereas if the corra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
had beene let lie on till it
had eaten out the corruption
indeed, then it might have been
whole long agoe.</p>
            <p>Let these therfore attend on
the ministery of the Word still,
till they have learned from
thence what Gods meanings
are towards them, who will
give them such counsell, as (if
they will be ruled by it) shall
bring all to good end in due
time.</p>
            <p>You have heard of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the Law in one that
should become a beleever:<note place="margin">The Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pells wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</note> but
the Law workes no such thing;
when it hath slaine a man, there
it leaves him without any hope
or helpe in himselfe or any
other.</p>
            <p>But now then the Gospell
comes, and is glad tydings of
salvation, and speakes better
things, and by little and little
workes faith in him that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times


<pb n="113" facs="tcp:27910:63"/>
was farre off from any
such thing.</p>
            <p>First, the Gospell proclaimes
a remedy, and tells the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and this terrified sinner, that
there is yet helpe to bee had for
miserable sinners, whereby they
may bee saved from all their
woe, and may become the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of God, and be heires of
heaven, <hi>viz.</hi> that God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
his Sonne Iesus Christ to
the world, who being eternall
God become also man, and in
both natures hath wrought a
most perfect satisfaction for us,
satisfying all our debt, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying
Gods wrath by his suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
in soule and body, and
by his perfect obedience hath
purchased us eternall life. And
that there is none excluded
from their part in this, but they
that exclude themselves. And
that God is gracious and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull,
not desiring the death of
a sinner, but willing to have


<pb n="114" facs="tcp:27910:64"/>
mercy upon him; so that if hee
be not more willing to perish
than God is to save him, hee
may doe well.</p>
            <p>Now, the Gospell revealing
this, by the helpe of the spirit
the partie is inlightened to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
this, which is not yet
knowne of everybody.</p>
            <p>Secondly, by the same spirit
hee is made able to beleeve
that there is such a remedie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
I meane in generall, but
whether he shall have any part
in it, is counsell yet to him, and
farre off, so that this partie is
neither ignorant of the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
nor yet doubtfull, but
knowes and beleeves it. These
be the workes of the Gospell,
and that every one that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves
shall have part in this
remedy, yea, and that if hee
could beleeve, he should have
his part also in it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Gospell thus
making us to know and beleeve


<pb n="115" facs="tcp:27910:64"/>
the remedy, workes further:
Oh it staies him from sinking
under his burden, from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire,
and keepes his head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
water. And this is as far
as it is beleeved; for alas
some are very hardly staid with
this: for what is an uncertaine
and absent benefite able to doe
in a certain and present misery,
or to stay one? but some it doth
thus stay from utter despaire,
though as yet they remaine in
a heavie state. If one stung
with a serpent, swelling and in
grievous pain, should hear that
there is one forty or fifty miles
off that had an oile that had
cured some in such case, so that if
one should find him at home, &amp;
can get some of it, he might do
well again. This staies him a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
but alas his tormenting pain
continueth. And so it is in this
case.</p>
            <p>4. The next worke of the
Gospell is contrition and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse


<pb n="116" facs="tcp:27910:65"/>
of heart in this sinner,
which is a gracious worke of
Gods Spirit in a man, whereby
hee hearing of the mercy of
God and his gracious dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and that there may be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
for him, this breakes his
heart, and turnes legall terrour
for the punishment, to godly
griefe for sinne it selfe, for of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
God, and dishonouring
him that hath been so good to
him, to spare him all this while,
and not cut him off, and that
he understands he is of such a
gracious disposition. Oh vile
wretch that I am saith hee! a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
whom have I offended?
not against a Tyrant, but against
a most gracious God, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
and maintained mee, fed
and cloathed mee, when I did
nothing but rebell against him
and play the bedlam, who
might have damned mee thus
many yeares agoe, and yet spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
mee, and now puts thee in


<pb n="117" facs="tcp:27910:65"/>
some hope that I may find mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
at his hand: Oh woefull cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffe
that I have beene and am!
so long and often to have offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
so good a God.</p>
            <p>Now, that wee be not decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and thinke wee have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite
hearts, and have not, here
I will set out the notes of it,
by putting a difference between
it and some things like unto it.</p>
            <p>First, betweene naturall sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
and this contrition; nature
grieves for losses, sicknesses,<note place="margin">Diff. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween it and nat. sorrow.</note>
death of neere friends: this
breakes much both body and
minde, and makes folkes looke
old; and wee say, such an one
breakes apace, or is much bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
it is seene in his face: for
what is naturall sorrow but a
fleeing from s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mething that is
hurtfull to us, and when wee
cannot flee from it, then lying
under, it? But there is great
difference betweene it and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition,
and godly griefe: natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral


<pb n="118" facs="tcp:27910:66"/>
sorrow comes upon worldly
causes, contrition is for sin, and
wrought by the Word of God.</p>
            <p>Naturall sorrow is momenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
for though a man be grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
for his broken arme or leg,
or this or that losse of goods,
of childe, or wife, yet in time
this griefe weares away, when
God hath recompenced our
losse some other way.</p>
            <p>But contrition &amp; sorrow for
sin is perpetuall, and lasts ever:
though he get comfort, yet he is
broken in heart for his sins all
his life long, and broken from
his sinnes for ever; for he will
never turne to them more.</p>
            <p>And this may stay some that
have feared their owne sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
because when they have
lost wife, husband, childe, they
have grieved exceedingly; it
hath broken their heart, caused
plentifull teares, yea such hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinesse
as could not be comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
and kept within doores:


<pb n="119" facs="tcp:27910:66"/>
But never could finde such bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
hearts for their sinnes, nor
weepe so bitterly in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of them.</p>
            <p>This may be in a true childe
of God: for the griefe for
worldly losses came sodainely,
and was for a time great, but in
time it weares away and is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,
when God hath healed
him againe: But the griefe for
your sinnes continueth still,
doth it not? you grieve no
more now for the paine or losse
you had twenty yeares agoe;
that is gone, but you grieve still
for the sinnes you committed
so long agoe. Well then this
may be, and is farre greater.
That was like a land flood, a
sudden running over of a small
brooke, but the water in a great
River that keepes within its
bankes is more than that.</p>
            <p>Againe,<note place="margin">Betweene it and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</note> there is this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betweene legall terrour
and this contrition, seeing that


<pb n="120" facs="tcp:27910:67"/>
is for punishment most what,
this chiefly for sinne; that
wrought by the Law and legall
comminations, this by the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
and hearing of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy:
that terrifieth and ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth
a man as a blow on the
head with a leaver, and smites
him downe, leaving him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any feeling at all, or if there
be any, it moves him to flye
from God as from a terrible
Iudge. But this is a smarty
griefe of heart for offending
God, which troubles him more
than the feare of hell ever did,
and so vexeth him, that if there
were no hell to punish him hee
would thus grieve.</p>
            <p>Legall terrour leaves the
heart as whole as it was, and
still hardened. True it is that
it stops the working of pride,
and holds downe the acts of it
for a time and damps it, but the
habit and disposition thereof is
the same that before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>


               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:27910:67"/>
one should with a barre of Iron
burst into three or foure pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
a stone, or brasse morter,
yet for all that it remaines as
hard as before; but a soft fire
melts it, and makes it fit to bee
cast into a mould. So though
<hi>Felix</hi> trembled, yet the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as covetous still as he was
before, and expected a bribe,
which because he failed of, hee
left <hi>Paul</hi> bound. <hi>Ahab</hi> though
so stucke downe and humble <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
yet after he continued as vile,<note place="margin">Acts 24. 26. 27.</note>
and imprisoned <hi>Michaiah;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 King 22 27.</note> so
<hi>Iudas</hi> after his terrour yet ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
murther to murther; and
they <hi>Num.</hi> 14. 1. 2. 3. 4.</p>
            <p>But contrition mollifieth the
hardnesse, and breaks in peeces
the wholenesse of the heart; as
wee may see in the examples of
contrite ones who never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
the like, sinnes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>.
So <hi>David</hi> never numbred the
people more.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, there is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence


<pb n="122" facs="tcp:27910:68"/>
betweene it and the
counterfeit contrition of an
hypocrite,<note place="margin">Betweene it and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition.</note> which is a light
griefe, and flitting sorrow of
unsound professors, who wring
the hands, shed a few teares, or
make some complaints of
themselves for their sinnes, but
it is quickly over; like a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
dew that soone is lickt up
when the Sunne ariseth; or
like a bull-rush that bowes
while the winde blowes it, but
when the blast is over, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
to its former straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
            <p>But Contrition is a searching,
pricking, and stinging sorrow,
which abides also till God
doth remove and turne it into
quietnesse; yea, and sometimes
also after. Many have had good
pangs after the Word prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
which if they had lasted,
might have beene the hope and
beginning of true contrition
indeed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:27910:68"/>
Therefore wee may see that
this is a gracious and divine
worke in the heart of a man
sarre exceeding any of these
three.</p>
            <p>Yea an excellent gift it is
that humbles a sinner truely
and kindly, and so breeding hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
makes him capable of
all the graces of God:<note place="margin">Psal. 25. 9.</note> for <hi>the
humble he will teach his wayes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It makes the heart soft and
tender, that the sins may come
up by the roots, yea teacheable,
and apt to have any good thing
planted in it, and soft to receive
the impression of the Lord in it.</p>
            <p>Yet here for all this we must
understand,<note place="margin">It is not repentance</note> that this contriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is not repentance, but dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
much from it: For contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is
a preparative act sitting a
man to Faith; repentance is a
grace consequent and followes
after faith: contrition is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded
good inclination,
purpose, desire, that would doe


<pb n="124" facs="tcp:27910:69"/>
much, <hi>viz.</hi> turne from all sinne
for ever, and doe all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
good: but alas, it is not
able to performe it, in respect it
cannot in it selfe, nor in Christ;
for hee is not yet in Christ till
faith be formed in him.</p>
            <p>But repentance is a groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
grace, whereby a man by
faith being planted into Christ,
hath from him wherewithall
to carry him out to turne from
all sinne, and take up the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
good. They therefore
that confound contrition and
repentance (as some do, &amp; they
no Papists) runne into two ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities:
First, that repentance
goes before faith: Secondly,
that a man may doe some good
thing, and pleasing to God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> Is not a contrite and
broken heart, acceptable to
God and pleasing?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> True, as it is the gift
and worke of his Spirit it is,


<pb n="125" facs="tcp:27910:69"/>
but in the beginning it is not as
it comes from us: neither can
the sinner know that this his
contrition pleaseth God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
hee knowes not himselfe
to have faith. True, it is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
hard to say the very time
when faith is wrought; but till
it bee, nothing doth simply
please God. To make this
plaine, understand that there
bee three kindes of the gifts of
God.</p>
            <p>Some common to elect and
reprobate, as knowledge in
Scripture, prophecy, tongues,
miracles.</p>
            <p>Some speciall, belonging to
the elect onely, as faith by
which we are justified, a renu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
heart, a good conscience, the
feare of God.</p>
            <p>Some middle ones wrought
in the heart of those that yet
be not actually the Children of
God, yet certainely shall bee,
and which whosoever have


<pb n="126" facs="tcp:27910:70"/>
wrought in them, shall surely
have faith, and cannot goe long
without it. Such are, this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition,
and such dispositions as
be in men before faith, which
yet are wrought by the Gospell.
These are better than common
gifts, yet not actually graces,
and yet gracious inclinations
to faith, which are in those that
are to be justified, and which (if
we speake properly) cannot be
wrought in any that shall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish.</p>
            <p>To proceed further in shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the working of this contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:<note place="margin">The work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition.</note>
when the Gospell speakes
so graciously of the Lord, and
his readinesse to forgive
wretched sinners never so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
or so great offences, yet the
sinner terrified by the Law
cannot beleeve and apply it. Oh
no, saith he, no such thing for
me, I have beene thus and thus
vile, and have thus and thus
dishonoured God, when hee


<pb n="127" facs="tcp:27910:70"/>
waited my conversion and
good: I ranne from him and
plaid my parts, I despised the
Ministers, and all good people,
&amp;c. Well, yet saith the Gospell,
the Lord may have mercy upon
thee, so as thou doest humble
thy selfe: What, to me? no such
matter. Yes, even to thee. Oh
then you have given him his
loade, hee seekes to get alone,
that he might weepe his belly
full; he cannot containe then:
but as the gracious eye of our
Saviour Christ upon <hi>Peter</hi> mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him into teares, so is his
heart melted and resolved into
teares of repentance. Never
did <hi>Benhadad</hi> and his servants
hearing that the Kings of Israel
were mercifull Kings, humble
themselves more with ropes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
their necks in sack-cloath,
than this man will to God.</p>
            <p>Oh hee cryes out, Against
whom have I sinned? against a
Tyrant? no, but against a most


<pb n="128" facs="tcp:27910:71"/>
gracious God, that is so merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
as could not be put out of his
gracious course, by all my wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse;
and yet gives mee
some hope of mercy. Oh vile
wretch, villaine that I am to
offend so gracious a God.</p>
            <p>If I had done thus much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
a man, or the tithe I have
done against him, hee would
have pursued mee to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
long ere now, and hunted
me out of the country; it should
have beene to hot for me: but
the Lord hath spared mee all
this while. Oh this cuts his
soule more than the feeling of
hell for the time.</p>
            <p>This also so changeth his
minde, that whereas before he
could goe bolt upright for all
his sinnes, now they crush him
to the ground: before sinne
was as sweete as hony, now
more bitter than gall or worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood:
before he could goe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
all his sinnes, and never


<pb n="129" facs="tcp:27910:71"/>
shrinke, now one lies heavie
upon his conscience: before the
doctrine of repentance he loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
it, and fled from it as from
a madde dogge, serpent, or an
arrow shot, because it shot at
his lusts and lewd companion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
or against sinnes which
he loved as his life; now who
that could come and tell him
how hee might bee quite rid of
his sinnes, and bee never more
troubled with them or have to
doe with them, were one of a
thousand a most welcome man:
so that now his daintiest meate
is his bane, and contrariwise
this bitternesse and griefe of
heart makes him fetch up all
his sweete morsells.</p>
            <p>This breedes an utter and
deepe dislike of all his former
courses. Hee cannot abide to
thinke of them; yet cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
them: they are ever before
him, but so as hee is broken
from them for ever, turning to


<pb n="130" facs="tcp:27910:72"/>
them no more: oh it hath stung
him so as hee can never have
pleasure to doe any more that
hee hath done; as <hi>David</hi> had
small joy ever to number the
people more, for which his
heart smote him.</p>
            <p>Yea it makes him angry with
himselfe and vexe, as <hi>David,</hi>
that hee had done so exceeding
foolishly, and that he was a foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
ignorant beast.</p>
            <p>Yea to confesse his sinnes,
and shame himselfe. No body
shall neede to tell him what to
say, for his heart is full, and hee
will powre out all to God, and
say more against himselfe than
any body else can.</p>
            <p>Yea hee will aggravate his
sinnes by the patience of God:
Oh they be so much the vilder;
because God hath had so much
patience towards mee: oh I
was unworthy that hee should
ever thus beare with me. Also
by the meanes he hath had: If


<pb n="131" facs="tcp:27910:72"/>
I had not had the meanes of
grace, it would not grieve me
so much, but I that have lived
so long under such meanes and
made no use of them, oh wofull
wretch.</p>
            <p>It will cause him to humble
himselfe before God, and throw
away all conceit or trust of any
thing in himselfe, of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
wit, learning, worldly
wisedome, civility, and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
of his owne. Oh these
he stood not a little upon, and
thought himselfe no meane one,
but now he accounts all dung,
abhorres himselfe in dust and
ashes; as <hi>Paul</hi> that counted his
priviledges that he was a Iew,
a Pharisee, learned in the Law,
zealous, strict; oh these made
him proud and to lift his head
full highly, but when God
humbled him, he then accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
all dogs meat and dung, and
sought for all good out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
in Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:27910:73"/>
Lastly, to this contrite per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is given softnesse and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse
of heart, whereby he
is fitted and prepared to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
further instruction from
the Lord; for as yet he hath his
burden on his shoulder, and
knowes not what God will doe
with him; but goe back againe
he never will, but will waite
upon God for his direction,
what he would have him doe.</p>
            <p>Hee cryes out therefore and
complaines, I am loaden, who
shall ease me? undone, who shall
helpe me? to beare it he feeles
intolerable, to escape it in
himselfe impossible, onely some
little faint hope keepes him
from despairing.</p>
            <p>Now we must take notice of
the necessitie of this contrition
in every kinde of sinner that
shall ever come to good:<note place="margin">Necessity of contrition.</note> for
the prophane person that hath
boldly and without all feare
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>one on, hee must be crusht in


<pb n="133" facs="tcp:27910:73"/>
heart for sinne, ere ever he shall
have mercy at Gods hand, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
promise belong to him.</p>
            <p>So the civill man and carnall
Gospeller, and hypocriticall
professors, that thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in happie case, that they
please God highly with that
they doe, yea, that they deserve
not onely health, wealth, and
outward blessings, but even sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
at last at Gods hand for
their good service they have
done. But they must come to
loathe and abhore these, and
will. When God workes this
contrition, then they shall see
what base and poore stusse it
was, they have so highly
thought of, seeing now they
shall discerne that God makes
base reckoning of it, and holds
it as abomination; for when
they served God, it was onely
in ceremony and shew, without
any substance or looking to
their hearts to doe it in any


<pb n="134" facs="tcp:27910:74"/>
carefulnesse of heart for the
manner.</p>
            <p>Yet how hard a thing it is to
bring the heart of man to
breake for and from his sinnes!
oh it is God onely can doe it,<note place="margin">Difficulty.</note>
men had rather part with any
thing, nay, all they have, nay
lose their very lives than their
lusts: oh the rebellious heart of
man, that hath had too long ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with sinne to bee
broken from it shortly, and is
too deepely rivetted in evill,
that he should easily be pulled
from it.</p>
            <p>Now the consideration here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
should forcibly move us to
be highly thankfull to God,<note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note> who
as he hath provided a blessed
remedy, so hath proclaimed it
by his Gospell to the sonnes of
men, which is a speciall privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that they have not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes enjoyed.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> let us examine
whether the Gospell hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened


<pb n="135" facs="tcp:27910:74"/>
us, and whether wee
know and then beleeve the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,
and Gods mercifull na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>Next, did you ever feele the
Gospell breaking your heart,
and the loving kindnesse of
God melting you thus and
thus, as hath beene taught?</p>
            <p>Alas, most must say they know
not what any such thing
meanes: alas wee have few bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
hearts for sinne; and yet
there was never more cause,
never more meanes also, and
yet alas even the Gospell is dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
preached, but few are melted
herewith.</p>
            <p>Most will not part from their
corruptions, but had as liefe
you should pull their hearts
from them, as their lusts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they
know not how to live; it were
no life if they were barred of
them; many know not how
they should spend their time if
they were left. It may bee at


<pb n="136" facs="tcp:27910:75"/>
last they wish they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
againe in respect of the
punishment they see to come
for them; but that is no contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Well, as loath as you are
to come to it, your heart must
be broken ere God will have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
mercy for you.</p>
            <p>Others will goe with you in
many things, shew liking to the
Word, love to the Ministers, be
moved at the Word, desire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
mercy and salvation, yea
mend many things amisse, and
doe many duties, and yet for a
contrite heart, you must par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
them for that. If you urge
it, either you shall heare no
more of them, as <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi>
did not of <hi>Herod,</hi> and Christ of
many of his Disciples, or else
they will bee borne with for
that, they will coast over ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way, and meet you anon,
but over this steepe hill, and
cragged rocke, yet shall not
lead them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:27910:75"/>
Nay many thinke themselves
beleevers and in great good
case, that yet never came
where contrition of heart
grew: but their profession, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and faith is but vaine,
and will perish with them, if
they trust to it; like <hi>Laodicea</hi>
men would be saved and be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers,
but they will goe to
heaven whole without blemish.
But know that thy heart is not
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it for God till it bee broken;
and as our Saviour Christ was
no sacrifice for our sinnes till
his soule was broken for our
sinnes, so shall wee never have
part in this sacrifice, till our
hearts be broken for sinne.</p>
            <p>Oh this makes our preaching
so unprofitable, religion so cost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a service, and faith so rare,
because few are ever thus bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.
Oh we may teare our
throats, and weare our tongues
to the stumps, ere wee can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
a sinner to see the odious


<pb n="138" facs="tcp:27910:76"/>
hainousnesse of his sinne, and
danger of it, and bring him to a
detestation of it.</p>
            <p>And why is this? because
few beleeve and deepely consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
either of their owne mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
or of Gods gracious disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and readinesse to shew
mercy; which if they did, it
could not but breake their
hearts. Let us therefore bee
perswaded to this duty, unto
which we may be best enabled
by the deepe weighing of both
these together, and praying
God to worke us to it. But oh
the vile heart of man, sinne
must have sorrow; if not here,
then hereafter: If men feele
not the terrours of the Law
here, but be lusty, and spend
their dayes in carnall delights,
time will come that God will
awaken their consciences, and
their terrours (may bee in this
life) if not, yet hereafter they
will prove untolerable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:27910:76"/>
Now I would here further
perswade those that be contrite
hearted, first to be thankfull to
God that hath brought them
to this passe: the promise of
God belongs to such, therefore
bee of good comfort; and
though thou beest not yet able
to apprehend it, yet if thou
couldest it is thy due, with Gods
good leave. Christ came to ease
the weary, finde the lost, heale
the sicke, binde up the broken,
and therefore he will have
mercy on thee. Which that thou
maiest the better beleeve, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
the example of the
Publican, Prodigall, <hi>David,</hi> those
<hi>Act.</hi> 2. 39. who were all in the
like case.</p>
            <p>And let this also bee added,
that seeing God hath brought
thee thus farre, he meanes not
to leave thee now, but will have
mercy on thee. And his end in
casting thee downe was not to
destroy but to save thee:he hath


<pb n="140" facs="tcp:27910:77"/>
delivered thee from insensible
blockishnesse and hardnesse of
heart, and in thy terrour hath
kept thee also, and hath not
suffered thee to bewaile thy
sinne sleightly, but truly, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly,
deeply and constantly:
hee would never have done all
this for thee, if hee had not
meant to bring thee further,
hee would have left thee ere
this.<note place="margin">Iudg. 13. 23.</note> As therefore <hi>Manaohs</hi>
wife said to him, <hi>If the Lord
were pleased to kill us hee would
not have shewed us these things:</hi>
so I say to thee, If the Lord
would have cast thee off, hee
would not have used so many
meanes to draw thee unto him.</p>
            <p>Now I should proceed to
some other steps toward faith
wrought by the Gospell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
this contrition and
faith,<note place="margin">Answer to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trites ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections.</note> save that there is yet
somewhat more to bee said to
this contrite-hearted person,
who hath his burden upon his


<pb n="141" facs="tcp:27910:77"/>
shoulders, and is not yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
that any part in the
remedy doth belong to him.</p>
            <p>Why, hath he not right in the
promise? yes there is nothing
on Gods part why hee may not
apprehend and apply it; God
gives him good leave, and the
promises are made to such.
And though a man dares not
apply the promise to one only
terrified by the Law, yet to one
truly thus humbled by the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
and contrite-hearted, wee
dare doe no other: yet this
party is not able to apprehend
it, there is much both within
and without him to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>1. The divell is a great ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
to it, who envies that he is
come thus farre, knowing now
he shall lose him; and therefore
he will prolong the worke all
that he can, and hinde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the
proceeding of it. Hee knowe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
that beleeuing is, the mother


<pb n="142" facs="tcp:27910:78"/>
both of comfort and obedience;
therefore he opposes it all hee
can.</p>
            <p>2. Himselfe hath much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it: he (it may be) with
his griefe hath forgotten that
God hath made promise of
mercy to the penitent, or if he
remember it, yet hee will call
into question, whether hee be
such an one or no; yea or if he
be and cannot deny it, yet he is
not able to apply it to himselfe
through weaknesse. Like a sick
man that knoweth he hath
right to his meat, but is so
weaker, that he is not able to
reach for it and put it to his
mouth.</p>
            <p>If a man had nothing to doe
for him but teach him that he
knowes not, or bring to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
that hee had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,
or make him know
that he is such an one that the
Promise belongs to, it were but
an easie taske. But here is the


<pb n="143" facs="tcp:27910:78"/>
difficultie, to make him beleeve
that notwithstanding any thing
that can be said of Sathan or his
owne corruption, that he is the
childe of God, and the promise
of mercy and salvation belongs
to him. This party hath many
objections against it, some of
which I will recite, and answer
them, and so proceed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> When the promise of
pardon is offered to this party,
Alas, to me, saith he? no such
matter, that were marvell: oh
no I am vile, and see nothing
but wretchednesse and misery,
as being at the very pits brinke.
They that can beleeve it, let
them, they be happy men, for
my part I am farre off, I dare
not. A likely matter, that from
such low abasement I should be
advanced to such honour, from
hell to heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> And why not you as
well as others that have beene
as farre off as you? and have


<pb n="144" facs="tcp:27910:79"/>
beene long held off, yet have
got comfort at last, and so shall
you. God hath not excluded
you, therefore shut not out
your selfe. What if sorrow and
comfort be contraries? yet sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
tends to comfort; and what
if he therefore cast thee downe
that he might raise thee up, and
would never have brought thee
thus farre, if he had not purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
good to thee?</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Ob.</hi> Alas what likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
is there that God should
receive and accept mee when
men reject me? my superiours
they contemne me, my friends
that have loved mee and have
beene glad of my company,
even they looke aloofe and care
not for me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> What of this? God
seeth not as men see for they see
carnally. They of the world
love and like their owne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and

rejecting thee is no argument

God will doe so, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
rather, as wee see in the
example of the blinde man;
<hi>Iohn</hi> 9. When thou wert whole,

if I could doe thus or
thus, there were some hope.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> What hath God
been doing all this while but to
pull downe thy proud stomack,
and yet dost thou talke of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineffe?
When thou wert a

selfe worthy, but thou shouldest
not, now that thou art a Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane.</p>
            <p>Thou art unworthy; it is true,
if not, what need hadst of Gods
mercy? or what glory should
God have of giving one for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other?
giving something to one
that were worthy to attaine it.
thou speakest as though thou
wouldest not bee beholding to
God, but he will accept thee
though unworthy, that he may
binde thee to him for ever.
Count not God, as a man to
whom <hi>nothing bring, nothing
have:</hi> God is about to make
thee worthy, and they worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
stands in his free favour:
The feeling of thy unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
makes thee worthy, that
is, fit for God to shew mercy to
thee, seeing, besides thy sinne
that makes thee unworthy,
thou hast a sense of it, and a
heart broken for it, and having
these, God will not reject thee


<pb n="148" facs="tcp:27910:81"/>
because of thy unworthinesse.
Thou wert never worthy nor
fit till now; when thou wert in
better case in thine owne fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
God cared lesse for thee,
and thou wert further off.
What talkst thou of worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
when the Angels bee not
cleer in his sight, nor the Saints
worthy in themselves? Know
that God respects (in shewing
thee mercy) his goodnesse and
mercy, and not thy goodnesse;
that hee doth, is free. Againe,
have others that have found
mercy had it for their worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse?
or could they see cause
in themselves, why they should
find mercy rather than others?
And as for thy doings, thou
must have that power from
God after thy beleeving, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
beleeve first.</p>

and thee, so long as thy heart is
broken for them; so long as
God is the Physitian, no matter
what be the disease: his mercy
is above all thy sinnes. Christs
merits is not a weake plaister
that can heale a greene cut, but
not an old sore: so to conceive

no matter what thou hast been,

it is, the more cause hast thou to
be thankfull, both here and in

it please the Lord to work that
in thee that he workes in few,
and to bestow that mercy on
thee that hee gives to few;
if, I say, he will be thus graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
the more cause hast thou

as some, then I could beleeve.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Beware thou become
not a Papist in thinking to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
mercy by thy contrition:
oh it is not thy contrition, if it
had been a hundred times
more, could merit pardon of
the least of thy sinnes. If the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ord Iesus had not suffered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
sorrow and griefe in
soule and body for them, it is
not all our grieving could satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
Gods justice for the least of
our sinnes; no not though wee
should weepe out our eyes, and
mourne to death. Therefore
though God hath appointed all
to whom hee will shew mercy
to bee contrite hearted; yet not
to come to mercy thereby as by
a meritorious meanes, but as by
a convenient and meet disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to prepare us to seek &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
mercy with thankfulnes.</p>
            <p>This is but a tricke of Satan,
who before contrition held
thee from sorrow, and would


<pb n="153" facs="tcp:27910:83"/>
have made thee thinke any too
much, and more than needes;
but now hee knowes that thou
hast sufficient in respect of
Gods gracious acceptance, he
would perswade thee it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
enough, because hee would
sinke thee if it were possible.
Though hee see thee stand
trembling with thy load on thy
shoulders, yet he would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
thee that thou feelest no
burthen.</p>
            <p>That contrition is enough
that God will accept and put an
end to, and that which drives
us so to seeke Christ, as wee
cannot bee satisfied without
him.</p>
            <p>If it please God to grant thee
mercy and comfort with more
ease, and more speed than some
others, be thankefull for it, and
adde not loade to thy burthen.
The Lord knowes what is fit
for every one; thou maiest soon
have more than thou canst


<pb n="154" facs="tcp:27910:84"/>
beare: God keepes not a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to all in this thing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> 8. But all the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
are made to beleevers, and
none others, and I have no
faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Though faith bee not
yet found in thee, nor thou a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to apprehend Christ, yet
thou art not farre from it:
therefore seeing the promise
belongs to thee, why dost thou
not strive now to lay hold on
it? Thou hast great neede of a
Physitian, and Christ hee hath
comfort for such: thou must
have helpe or else art undone,
and Christ is very willing to
helpe such, and such onely; why
then doest thou not catch hold
of him, reach out thy hand of
faith and touch him, that ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
may goe out of him to heale
thee? If thou canst not runne
to him, then goe, if not goe,
creepe; but be sure to lay hold
on him and touch him, as the


<pb n="155" facs="tcp:27910:84"/>
woman with the issue of bloud,
whom our Saviour Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
not for so doing, but
commended her highly: and so
would he thee if thou wouldest
follow her example and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
in him. Wee must not
thinke it plaseth God that wee
should stand straining of cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie,
but that wee beleeve God
on his word, that we may have
hearts and mouths to praise
him, and to set about the work
of a godly life.</p>
            <p>Thus the contrites doubts
being answered, and by Gods
goodnesse somewhat removed,
hee growes somewhat on fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and hearing the Lords
large and loving offer, and
without exception, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
his neede of it, and the
truth of God that promiseth
it, yea and to him; this breeds
in him a further thing, that is, a
desire after his part in this mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
which hath sundry comp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:27910:85"/>
with it, which are like
the hiding of the pearle by the
wise Merchant when hee had
found it.</p>
            <p>For between contrition and
faith are divers steppes. The
Lord could dispatch it at once,
seeing the contrite person hath
right to the promise, and God
meanes at last to doe him good,
save onely that God seeth it not
so good for him, but is long
preparing him for so great a
worke. And seeing it is for
the best, God doth him no
wrong, especially seeing hee is
upheld by hope of obtaining in
the end, which keepes him
from: discouragement. As
betweene the finding of the
pearle and buying it, are hiding
it, departing which joy, selling
all: now then is the pearle
found, when promise is made
to the humble and contrite, of
pardon in Christ, and salvation:
after which followes a desire


<pb n="157" facs="tcp:27910:85"/>
with care and joy, and then
hungring and thirsting for it,
and selling all for it; and then
buying it, which is beleeving,
when he apprehends the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
and applies it to himselfe.
Now for desire: Oh hee sees the
excellency of mercy, his need,
Gods offer, and that hee is in
good sadnesse; oh hee hath an
earnest desire in his heart; Oh
that it might bee, oh the Lord
grant it to me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> But what, is this partie
come no further than to desire
all this while? I thought he had
come to faith by this time: you
talkt of desire before, that
finding himselfe in a miserable
case, desired to be out of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> There is great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betweene that desire and
this; that was ungrounded, and
onely feeling himselfe in ill
case, he desired to be out of it,
but this is a grounded desire,
upon the promise that God


<pb n="158" facs="tcp:27910:86"/>
makes to him of mercy where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he builds: Lord thou hast
promised mercy to them <hi>that
labour and are heavie loaden if
they come to thee;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 11. 28</note> Lord I come
to thee, therefore have mercy
on mee.</p>
            <p>As if a rich man having ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
debters unable to pay him,
one of them feeling himselfe
so, desires hee had his debt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given
him, though hee have no
hope of it; but afterwards the
rich man sends him word, if he
will come to him, and confesse
the debt, and aske to have it
forgiven, he will: now hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
it after another fashion
with a more lively desire. Yea,
this party begins to lay some
hold on the promise, which puts
some life and warmth into
him, whereas when the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
before spake of the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
it was musicke to a sad
heart, but now he desires, and is
glad to heare the promises ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed


<pb n="159" facs="tcp:27910:86"/>
to him: wheras before he
sought for judgements, now he
turnes the Booke for comforts
and promises.</p>
            <p>Now to this desire is added request;<note place="margin">Request</note>
for he cannot keepe in
his desire in his heart, but it
must out, and so hee falls to
poure out his heart to God, to
lay out his bitter complaint,
confessing and crying for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
leaning upon the promise
as upon his staffe, which before
he could not fasten upon.</p>
            <p>For God will inure him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to that order hee must
take after with him, <hi>viz.</hi> to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
up his owne request, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition,
not giving unto him till
he be able to aske it: therefore
the spirit helpes his infirmity,
and teacheth him how to pray,
and what to aske, sending up
sighes and grones that cannot
be expressed.</p>
            <p>Thus did the Publican,<note place="margin">Luk. 18. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Oh
Lord bee mercifull unto mee a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi>


               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:27910:87"/>
So the Prodigall,<note place="margin">Luk. 15. 19</note> Make me
as one of thy hired servants.
So <hi>Manasses</hi> prayed to God, and
God heard him.</p>
            <p>Which confession and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
though an hypocrite may
make, yet not from a broken
heart. It is true, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and
<hi>Iudas</hi> confessed, but not in a
sound and right manner.</p>
            <p>To this is joyned care;<note place="margin">Care.</note> not a
hopelesse feare that God will
not be mercifull, but a scrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
solicitude, lest hee should
misse of his desire. He casts that
perill that never shall bee nor
can be (for God will shew him
mercy) and yet hee hath this
thought: But what if I should
misse? which serves onely to
adde to his industry, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
the bent of his indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.</p>
            <p>As no, man hath any great
matter in hand, though hee be
very far from it, but will have a
thought, What if he should be


<pb n="161" facs="tcp:27910:87"/>
prevented? to whet on his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
and stirre up his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
that hee may neglect no
meanes.</p>
            <p>The next is hope, <hi>viz.</hi> that
he shall obtaine,<note place="margin">Hope.</note> and that onely
because God hath spoken it:
and though hee have not the
strength to hold; it fast, yet hee
hopes hee shall, which doth
greatly animate him.</p>
            <p>This hope, though it bee not
the hope that is the daughter
of faith, <hi>that makes not ashamed,</hi>
which is as stedfast as faith it
selfe,<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 5.</note> and is the anchor of the
foule, yet it is farre differing
from the blinde groundlesse
hope of the world.</p>
            <p>The next is joy, proceeding
from this hope that he shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
and that he is so neere it;
as it is said of the Merchant
when hee had hid the pearle,
that hee departed with joy, as
being glad that he was so neere
a good bargaine, though yet he


<pb n="162" facs="tcp:27910:88"/>
had not bought it. Which joy,
though it be not so great as that
that comes after faith which is
unspeakeable, yet it is farre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the joy of hypocrites,
w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>^ is upon no, or false grounds;
as that of <hi>Agag, 1. Sam.</hi> 15. his
false joy of safety; and of
worldlings in their corne and
wine, or prophane ones in their
beastly lusts, whose joy shall be
turned into wailing and gnash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of teeth. This joy refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
greatly as the little <hi>Ionathan</hi> hony
that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

if he had eaten his fill? so what
shall bee to this party after be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving?</p>
            <p>And it is not to bee thought
strange he should have any joy
before beleeving; oh yes, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himselfe so neere a good
turne, it glads his heart. As the
poore blinde man, <hi>Mar.</hi> 10. 50.
that our Saviour Christ called
to him, hee threw away his
cloak, and arose hastily: so <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus,


<pb n="163" facs="tcp:27910:88"/>
Luk.</hi> 19. came downe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stily
and received Christ joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
ere ever hee had received
any good from him, though it
may be hee had some hope hee
should, if he were at his house
once.</p>
            <p>And all these together are
answerable to the hiding of the
pearle, and going away rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing;
for what was that but a
casting and musing in the mind,
and having divers conceits a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it; as thus, What successe
had I that ever I should finde
such a pearle <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
thousand findes any? what an
opportunity have I now of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching
my selfe for ever? what
a foole should I bee if I should
neglect it? were I ever like to
come to the like offer againe?
oh what neede have I of it?
what shall become of me with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it? and so doth he that hath
found the spirituall pearle.</p>
            <p>Next followeth hungring<note place="margin">Thirsting.</note>


               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:27910:89"/>
and thirsting for mercy and
Christ, all one with that of sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
all to buy the pearle.</p>
            <p>But because the holy Ghost
useth both phrases, I will speake
of both. The desire of him that
shall have mercy is compared
to hunger sometimes, most of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to thirst; not onely for some
resemblance between them, but
to shew that it is not a desire
fit to obtaine Christ and his
bloud, except it be like thirst.</p>
            <p>Hunger is a want of hot and
dry, thirst a want of cold and
moist, both grievous, but thirst
the more sore by much. If hot
and dry be wanting, yet if the
other bee supplyed, nature is
long supplyed and upheld: not
contrariwise. Thirst is of all
sensuall appetites the strongest,
most impatient of being unsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
and impotent of being
without that it desireth.</p>
            <p>1. He shew some resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances
betweene the naturall


<pb n="165" facs="tcp:27910:89"/>
and spirituall thirst: Thirst is
an emptinesse of cold and
moist, and a great paine arising
from the same by the sucking
and drawing of the veines in
the stomack, for some coole
moisture to nourish the lower
parts, when there is none, &amp; so it
pincheth the reines together,
and causeth great paine: So in
the spirituall thirst there is a
great emptinesse of all health,
hope, and happinesse in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
and so a great paine of
soule for want thereof.</p>
            <p>2. The thirsty hath a great
desire; an earnest, not faint or
cold desire after drinke,<note place="margin">Psal. 42.</note> as the
Hart for the rivers, or the dry
chapt gaping earth for raine,
yea and that without delay,
thinking everie day a yeare,
and an houre to bee a whole
day.</p>
            <p>So the spirituall thirster for
the bloud of Christ, doth not
coldly and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ily wish for it, but


<pb n="166" facs="tcp:27910:90"/>
importunately desires it, yea
cannot be content to say, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
and one day I hope I shall,
and that is as good, in sicknesse,
at my death. Oh no, give mee
drinke else I die: oh I faint for
want of it.</p>
            <p>3. This makes him set a
high price upon the thing hee
wants, without which he seeth
hee perisheth. I would give
twenty pound, a hundred
pound for drinke enough to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
mee, to save my life. And
so also it is in the spirituall
thirst.</p>
            <p>4. And this makes him take
any paines to compasse it;
whence is our proverbe, <hi>hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
breakes thorow stone walk.</hi>
Oh it will adventure it selfe,
take any paines. As one that ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly
seekes to kill one that
would else kill him; so he that
spiritually thirsteth will runne,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ide, early, late, heare, reade,
pray, conferre, and doe them


<pb n="167" facs="tcp:27910:90"/>
againe and againe to get faith,
and to compasse his desire. And
whereas before hee would not
stirre out of doore, now he ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
not what paines he taketh
to have his desire satisfied.</p>
            <p>5. The thirsty in his extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
thinkes with himselfe of
his folly when he had his fill,
how little he regarded it, and
was not thankful in that he had
at his list to drinke and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
himselfe; that he threw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
oft that hee would bee full
glad of now, yea it may be abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
it to drunkennesse, and now
hee accuseth himselfe of his
former folly: So the spirituall
thirster thinkes with vexation
to himselfe, How oft have I
heard of the sweet promises of
the Gospell, and never regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
them? take them who
would, I prized them not, they
were as water spilt for me: hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
was offered, take it who
would, and the merits of Christ;


<pb n="168" facs="tcp:27910:91"/>
I had other matters in hand:
But now the least promise
would glad my heart. I was a
full man that cared not for a
hony-combe, now if I had the
least of Gods sweet promises,
the crummes under the table
the droppings of the honey, it
would much refresh me.</p>
            <p>6. Hee then comes to pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
them that endure thirst, the
poore which hee heard com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
sometimes, but never
pitied, because hee never felt
what it was: Oh beast, saith he,
that I was, I never regarded the
state of the poore when I he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ter to save my life, I will

               </gap>.</p>
            <p>So the spirituall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

               </gap>


               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:27910:91"/>
out, that he hearing some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine,
and wring their hands,
and take great paines in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Word, pitied them
not, but thought them fooles,
and idle, in that they must
needs speake with the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.
I thought ill of them for
it, and counted it needlesse; but
now I know what it is, I feele
it my selfe; I hope if ever I bee
throughly satisfied, I shall bee
more pitifull and charitable in
censuring others.</p>
            <p>7. If a man thirst, when he
thinkes of all else he hath, hee
takes no pleasure in them:
what will his wealth, gold,
house, land, doe him good if
hee perish for thirst? nay it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
increaseth his griefe, to
thinke he must goe from all for
want of drinke. Bring him gay
cloathes, sweete smells, musick:
Away with all, give me drinke
to quench my thirst. As <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
had no joy of his great vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory


<pb n="170" facs="tcp:27910:92"/>
of the 1000. Philistines,
because he feared he should die
for thirst, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 15. 18. So hee
that spiritually thirsteth, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
Christ above all; so that if
you lay all the honours, profits,
pleasures in one scale, and
Christ in the other, he counts
all dung in comparison of him.
And he that is the greatest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
if hee come to this hunger,
hee takes no pleasure in all hee
hath, without, or in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of this.</p>
            <p>8. If any man should in this
case come to him, and bring
him drinke or water (as to a
man chased over a dry desart in
parching weather) would hee
straine courtesie, and say hee is
loth to be beholding, and he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
deserved it of him? oh no,
but hee gladly and thankefully
receives it, and eagerly falls to
it.</p>
            <p>So if any come to him in this
case, and comfortably apply the


<pb n="171" facs="tcp:27910:92"/>
promise of Christ and salvation
to him, and be an instrument of
comfort to him, oh he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
that day for ever, and
counts that party one of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand,
loves him ever after, and
gladly embraceth this gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
offer when he tendreth
it unto him. And if God will
vouchsafe to bestow this mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
on him, oh hee thinketh
himselfe bound to serve him on
hands and knees all daies of his
life; oh that were to bee writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in his heart with a pen of
iron.</p>
            <p>Selling all,<note place="margin">Selling all.</note> is when a man to
obtaine Christ and a part in his
death and obedience, for salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is content to part with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing that should stand in
his way to hinder him from it.</p>
            <p>What must the sinner sell?
all that he hath? what is that?
his goods, lands, children? No,
these be, none of his owne, God
hath but lent him these to use;


<pb n="172" facs="tcp:27910:93"/>
and some that would have
Christ, and shall, have no
goods to sell. What then is our
owne? our sinnes, and nothing
else: these therefore wee must
sell. Tush, what should you
name them? they be not worth
the selling to purchase Christ,
seeing they are but base things.
True, they bee such things as
one would thinke should not
be named with Christ, or that
we should make any account of
them; but such is our wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesse,
and sinne is so sweete,
and stickes so close, as, though
they be nought worth, yet wee
preferre them above any thing,
and love them as, yea before
our lives: many a man loseth
his life for his lusts. Therefore
when a man comes to this pass,
with indignation to be willing
to part with his sinnes, to have
no more to doe with them (as
hee must that will have part in
Christ, he cannot have Christ;


<pb n="173" facs="tcp:27910:93"/>
and keepe any one of his sinnes)
this is a great matter, and that
partie shall have the pearle.</p>
            <p>And thus God brings along
the man,<note place="margin">Buying.</note> and when he is at this
passe God seales it up to him,
and enables him to beleeve, and
saith, Seeing thou wilt have no
nay, be it unto thee according
to thy desire: and God seales
him up by the spirit of promise,
as surely as any writing is made
sure by sealing of it: then hee
beleeves the word of God, and
rests, and casts himself upon it.
And thus he findes himselfe dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
of all woe, made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker
of all good, at peace in
himselfe, and fitted, and in tune
to doe God some service.</p>
            <p>This is to some sooner, to
some later, according to the
helpes and meanes they have,
and wise handling they meete
withall, and as God gives
power.</p>
            <p>Some in the time of hearing


<pb n="174" facs="tcp:27910:94"/>
of the Word, open themselves,
and apprehend the promise;
some after, when they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
over that they have heard,
and musing, and trying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
thereby, get comfort and
lay hold.</p>
            <p>Some after humble and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
prayer, some at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And then is hee planted
into Christ, and a happy man
thence forward that ever hee
was borne.</p>
            <p>It is hard to say at what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
faith is wrought, whether
not till a man feels that hee
apprehends the promises, or
even in his earnest desires, hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring
and thirsting; for even
these are pronounced blessed.</p>
            <p>Some having got hold, hold
it faster than some by much, yet
none but with doubtings some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times;
yet some are much pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledged
this way, especially
they that came hardliest by it.</p>
            <p>Some ever and anon, let it


<pb n="175" facs="tcp:27910:94"/>
goe, and are full of doubtings,
and to seeke of that sometimes
they had; some upon one occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
some upon another, some
upon no occasion: But even
God that gave them power to
beleeve, withdrawing his hand
but a little, they are much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
that hereby they may
know whence their strength
is.</p>
            <p>And this may teach us Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
to shew the people the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Faith distinctly,<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> and
particularly the working of it,
and by what steps God brings
men to it, that they may try
themselves, and not bee decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
without which they that
have gone thus along, yet may
still hang in doubt whether
they have faith or no,</p>
            <p>And many thinke they have
it, when they never came neere
it, taking such long strides as
deceive themselves.</p>
            <p>2. This may move also the


<pb n="176" facs="tcp:27910:95"/>
people to try themselves. They
that have attained faith, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance,
and comfort, and
came by it thus, and by these
steps, let them enjoy it and bee
thankfull: no man dares speake
against it; nor let them call it
into question, or bee made to
doubt. Many are still questio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of their beginnings, and
though they came to faith and
comfort by these steps, yet are
still fearing that they have not
begun in truth, or that they are
not in the right way, or tooke
comfort ere it belonged to
them. True, it is good to bee
very carefull in laying the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of our house, but if wee
be ever pulling up after it is
laid, wee shall never finish the
building.</p>
            <p>3. They that now be in this
case, and on the anvill (as it
were) in framing to make be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers
of them, may also make
good use of that which hath


<pb n="177" facs="tcp:27910:95"/>
beene said. Didst thou ever
finde this earnest desire? didst
thon poure out thy humble and
earnest requests to God for
mercy, ease and pardon? hast
thou felt this care, this hope?
and hast thou felt this joy, even
because thou foundest thy selfe
not farre from enjoying so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable
a benefit? hast thou
felt such a hungring and thirst
after the blood of Christ, as thou
couldest not be quiet without
it; nothing else would satisfie?
hast thou highly prized it, and
doest thou finde thy selfe wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
as thou wouldest have any
mercy, to part with all thy
sinnes, even those that have
beene the most profitable, and
pleasing ones; that were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to thee as neere as thy
skin, as deare as thy life, so as
thou couldst uot bring thy
heart to thinke of leaving of
them, but thoughtst thou
couldst not live without them?


<pb n="178" facs="tcp:27910:96"/>
hast thou now finally made
them away?</p>
            <p>Be of good comfort, Christ
is thine, and the promise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to thee, and God can no
more deny thee thy part in
mercy and salvation, than hee
can lie, repent, or deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe:
and hath hee not promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
from time to time eternall
life to such? <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. and 22.
yea makes proclamation <hi>Isai.

            <p>Wherein is great difference
between the naturall and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
thirst; for in the naturall
a man may thirst, and yet bee
farre from drinke, or any thing
to coole or refresh him: his
thirst prepares him for drinke,
but prepares no drinke for him.
But in this its farre otherwise;
for as the spirituall thirst pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
a man for drinke, so i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>


               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:27910:96"/>
prepareth drinke for the man:<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 5.</note>
for God hath promised to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
every such one.</p>
            <p>So that a man may say of this
man and his thirst, as Christ of
<hi>Lazarus,</hi> This thirst is not unto
death;<note place="margin">Iohn 11.</note> for thou canst not but
have the well of water of life:
for God hath provided it for
such, yea for all such and none
other.</p>
            <p>In the other thirst, it is easie
to be a thirst, nay impossible in
parching heat &amp; labour but to
be so, but the difficulty is to get
water, which is furthest off ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times when it is most need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
In the spirituall the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
is to get a thirst; for if
that bee, the worst is over: for
then the water of life is at
hand, and cannot be wanting.</p>
            <p>Nay it is said he that drinkes
of this water by faith, shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
thirst more.<note place="margin">Ioh. 4. 14.</note> In the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
hee that hath his thirst sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
at one time, may yet at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other


<pb n="180" facs="tcp:27910:97"/>
time thirst, and dye
therewith. Not so in the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall;
hee shall never thirst
more. <hi>i.e.</hi> deadly: for though he
shall desire more grace, more
assurance of Christ and salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
yet he shall at first drinke
such a draught of Christ, as
hee shall never bee quite drie
more. And though hee may
sometimes lose some of his
feeling, or all, for a time, yet
he shall not deadly thirst, for
it shall spring up in him againe
in time.</p>
            <p>Yea he shall have out of his
belley even rivers of water
of life, flowing out to everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
life. Hee shall have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
to himselfe, and be able to
helpe, coole, and refresh others.
As many a one sometimes una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to lay hold of any comfort
themselves, after are able to
comfort others graciously.</p>
            <p>Be therefore of good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort:
It is thine, it is done in


<pb n="181" facs="tcp:27910:97"/>
heaven that thou wouldest
have: It only wants to be done
in thy conscience, which shall
be sure ere long; strive against
any doubting, and apprehend.
Gods call is for thee, therefore
come: hee bids thee beleeve,
therefore doe so. Though com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
be a cordiall lockt up with
the Lord, yet the thirster hath
unlocked it by his thirst, and
set open the vessell; and though
other water may be farre from
the thirsty, this is no further
off than God, who is ever neer
to those that call upon him
faithfully.</p>
            <p>But how few come to this state
of thirsting! As there are few
contrite, as I said before, so few
come to these steps; most peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are full, some with their lusts
and sinnes: they satisfie and
please them so well, as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
nothing else: they feele no
neede of Christ, they have no
leisure to attend him; hee doth


<pb n="182" facs="tcp:27910:98"/>
but trouble them: what is this
but to preferre <hi>Barrabas</hi> before
Christ, as <hi>Esau</hi> preferred pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to the birth-right?</p>
            <p>They are full of draffe and
hogs meate, but empty of any
good nourishment. If these
lusts and they might ever abide
together, then it were the lesse
to be wondered at, but in the
midst of all their lusts comes
the vengeance of God upon
them, and marres all the play:
as wee see in <hi>Balthashar.</hi> But
when God shall by death or
judgement call them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
what then? But that is
not thought of, its too sad a
thought. Then as they have
beene full of sinne, they must
also now bee filled with the
wrath of God.</p>
            <p>Some are so full of their
wealth, honour, and businesses,
and some of worldly dealings,
that these take them up suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently.
Alas poore vanities


<pb n="183" facs="tcp:27910:98"/>
poore Gadarens!</p>
            <p>Some full of their civill righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse,
others of their
knowledge, gifts, and professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
These are puft up with
wind, but it contents them: they
be full, and feele no want of
Christ.</p>
            <p>God must, and will emptie
your stomacke, and bring you
to another passe ere ever you
finde any mercy at his hand:
you must bee purged of this
stuffe. God will make you as
empty and lanke as a glove
ere ever you have any part of
his mercy or Christ. Many
would have Christ, but they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
coldly, lazily: now and
then they bestow a few cold
wishes, and prayers, or sighes
for him; but they can stay their
stomacks well enough without
him: what may they thinke of
themselves, when some others
cry out, and wring their hands,
weepe for one drop of the


<pb n="184" facs="tcp:27910:99"/>
blood of Christ, and they grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
sinners than these, and yet
are not one whit moved? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
asked if they be perswaded
of the love of God, and the
forgivenesse of their sinnes:
No truly (say they) but I would
I were. If you wanted but a
point to your hose, would you
wish you had one, and not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to get it? Wishers
and woulders goe without. I
hope I shall one day (say they)
ere I die. So they have it in their
sicknesse, and at their death,
they can now spare it. These
be too indifferent to obtaine:
then they would have some of
other folkes oyle, but oh they
must be more earnest and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
suitors if they will speed.</p>
            <p>And thinke wee God will
give men such a jewell in
death, that cared little for it in
life? No; it may be then they
would full faine. Now give me
that same, Lord, that thou offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redst


<pb n="185" facs="tcp:27910:99"/>
me a great while agoe.
No, it had beene good taking a
good bargaine when it was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.
If a man should bring
to one of you a hundred pound,
and you were shoveling up
dirt, or playing at cardes, and
should pray him not to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
you, and bid him come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
afterward, would not any
say hee were worthy to misse it
at his need? If one having a
pardon offered him, and should
make light of it, and should on
the ladder desire it, might hee
not well goe without it?</p>
            <p>Hath God nothing to doe
with his mercy (thinke you)
and Christs blood, but to cast it
away on those that can scarce
thinke they need it, or will
scarce thanke him for it? No,
Gods mercies goe not a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
yet, God can finde such to
bestow them on, as will thanke
him heartily, and embrace them
joyfully.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:27910:100"/>
Now wee his Ministers, his
Almoners to distribute his
comforts, even as many as bee
in the Scripture, dare not lavish
them out, and promise them to
such lazy indifferents as these:
But if wee see any ready to
faint for want, saying, Give me
drinke or else I die, then wee
reach the cup of consolation to
him, and bid him drinke of it;
neither dare wee to give it to
any other.</p>
            <p>God will not poure the oyle
of Grace or precious comfort
into a vessell full of cracks, that
will let it leake out againe.
Get therefore a thirsty soule,
see thy voidenesse of all good
in thy selfe, and that without
Christ there is nothing to bee
expected but perishing.</p>
            <p>Take the load of thy sinnes
on thy shoulders, and this will
so weary thee, as it will bring
thee to a thirst.</p>
            <p>How few ever come to sell


<pb n="187" facs="tcp:27910:100"/>
all for Christ? No, but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
they will part with,
but not with some by any
meanes. So <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>
were content to forgoe two
parts: and those hypocrites, <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caiah</hi>
6. would part with a
thousand of Rams, &amp;c. but not
with their sinnes. Thou art a
higler, a benchwhistler, a base
chapman that standest halfe-penying
with God, and shalt
neuer come to be the owner of
this treasure. How many bee
like him, that comes and tastes,
and likes the Merchants wine,
commends it, cheapens, askes
the price, offers somewhat to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it, but not to the worth?
The Merchant will abate no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and tells him it is a very
good pennyworth: the other
will give no more, and so they
part. The Merchant hath his
wine still, but the other goeth
away empty, and after (may be)
comes againe, and it is gone:


<pb n="188" facs="tcp:27910:101"/>
another came and swept it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
            <p>How neere come some that
yet shall never have heaven?
they lose heaven for some one
lust; if they could but yeeld up
that one thing that was wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
it might have beene a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.
Oh folly! oh madnesse to
be bewailed! play not the
foole; away with that other
lust too: it is an unspeakable
rich bargaine. Oh shall I part
with my deceit in my shop, my
lust, my pleasure, this way and
that? alas, spare me in this one
thing. What talkst thou of
pleasure, lay away thy sinne,
that brings sinfull and deadly
stinging pleasure, that will end
in eternall paine; and take up
Christ that will bring thee true
and sound pleasure, that shall
begin here, and never end, but
be full and perfect hereafter for
ever in heaven.</p>
            <p>God open peoples eyes.


<pb n="189" facs="tcp:27910:101"/>
A body would thinke there
should bee no great ado to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
men to such a reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
nay to such a gainefull bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine:
but such is mans wofull
blindnesse, and inability to see
or to judge what is best, as hee
chuseth most preposterously to
his owne destruction.</p>
            <p>And thus much of the causes
and meanes of Faith, and how
it is wrought in us.</p>
            <p>Having spoken of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
and meanes of Faith,<note place="margin">Degrees of Faith.</note> it
followeth that wee now speake
of the degrees of it. All at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
not to a like measure, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is any great measure at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
unto at once, but in time
and by degrees. There is a
strong Faith and a weake: see
<hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 18. &amp;c. where the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
sheweth what had beene a
weake Faith, or what it had
beene for <hi>Abraham</hi> to have
consulted with flesh and bloud,
with sense and reason, and so


<pb n="190" facs="tcp:27910:102"/>
to have doubted of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of God, which hee did
not, but was contrariwise
strengthned in faith, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>A little Faith and a great
Faith are both mentioned in
Scriptures: of a great Faith we
have an example in the Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion,
<hi>Matth. 8. 10. I have not
found so great Faith, no not in
Israel.</hi> and <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. in the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of Cana, that did abide so
many repulses, and yet hung
still on Christ, <hi>O woman great is
tby Faith,</hi> &amp;c. Of small Faith
we have an example in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples,
<hi>Matth. 16. 8. O ye of little
Faith:</hi> So, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 26. all the
Disciples are for their little
Faith reproved: and <hi>Peter</hi> alone,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 14. 31. Some Faith is so
weake that it is called unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe,
as <hi>Mark. 9. I beleeve;
Lord helpe my unbeleefe, &amp;c.</hi> So
when the Disciples asked our
Saviour why they could not
heale the lunaticke childe, hee


<pb n="191" facs="tcp:27910:102"/>
answereth them, because of
your unbeleefe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. 20.
<hi>For if you had Faith as a graine of
mustard seede, &amp;c.</hi> So that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
beleevers and unbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
such as have no Faith,
which bee many: some that
have no shew of it; some that
have a bold presumptuous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
some a temporary Faith,
which are sometimes bold, and
lifted up, sometimes as quite to
seeke againe, and all because
they have no good foundation,
and indeede have no true
Faith. There are also degrees
betweene true beleevers, even
as God pleaseth to bestow on
some more on some lesse, <hi>Ephes.
4. 7. 1. Cor. 2. 11. Rom.</hi> 1 2. 3. e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
as God hath imploiment
for them, or as they have
meanes, or as they bee carefull
in the use of them. As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God deales in the bodily
stature, making some high some
low, &amp;c. as in the temporall


<pb n="192" facs="tcp:27910:103"/>
goods, some are rich, some poor,
some from poore become rich,
some continue ever poore, some
of rich become poore &amp;c. And
as in the family of yonguer
folkes there bee children of all
sorts, some can worke, one
rocke the cradle, another in
the cradle &amp;c. So it is in the
Church of God.</p>
            <p>First then I will speake of a
weake Faith,<note place="margin">1. Weake Faith.</note> and then of a
strong. A weake Faith is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
when a man or woman is
of small knowledge in the
Scriptures and principles of
Religion, or weake in appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of the promises of God
concerning forgivenesse of
sinnes and salvation by Christ,
having attained some perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and sometimes a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in it, and yet againe
doubtfull, and to seeke, and full
of feares lest it be not so, and
that they never begunne well.
Or when a man is cast backe


<pb n="193" facs="tcp:27910:103"/>
againe, and becommeth doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
sometimes of perseverance,
when considering what ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
there be, and how weake
he is, and what oppositions hee
may meete with.</p>
            <p>Sometimes fearing hee shall
never get strength against some
of his corruptions, and that
therefore his Faith will faile
him at the last, and hee shall
marre all: sometimes when hee
gets a little ground, hee is of
good hope; sometimes againe
in his dumps and deepe feares.</p>
            <p>So sometimes Christians are
weake in the other inferiour
promises,<note place="margin">Note <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 26 at the voice of the mai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e.</note> and grow soone di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scouraged
by little things; and
as the Disciples, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. If
they be in any trouble, they are
ready to faint, or thinke it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
long, to be freed. If helpe
come not by and by, then they
are discouraged, and are ready
to helpe themselves by unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
meanes, as <hi>Asa, 2. Cro.</hi> 16.


<pb n="194" facs="tcp:27910:104"/>
or else they are full of cares for
the world, fearing they shall
want ere they die, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
grow too carefull, though
God hath made promises to the
contrary.</p>
            <p>Examples of weak faith there
are many in the Scripture: as in
the Disciples <hi>Matthew</hi> 26. 28.
who all fled from their Master,
&amp; could not beleeve his Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
when <hi>Mary</hi> told them.</p>
            <p>Many there were in the times
of persecution, that hid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
or fled; some taken that
recanted, though soone after
getting more strength, they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
put forth themselves, and
suffered couragiously; some ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
had strength, which yet
no doubt had some measure of
Grace.</p>
            <p>Many in our own times, yea too
many, are weake in faith, some
ever and anon in their dumpes
and feares after some comfort
received: and so in other
things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:27910:104"/>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> But how can you tell
that this is true faith at all, that
is so full of doubtings, &amp;c?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Yes very well, by this,
that the comfort and assurance
they sometimes have, they
have got it the right way, and
came to it by the steps whereby
it pleaseth God to bring men
to faith by.</p>
            <p>2. The spirit of God, which
cannot deceive them, witnesseth
to their spirit.</p>
            <p>3. These signes shew it, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they constantly and earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
still seeke the Lord Iesus
Christ, and the favour of God;
they grieue at their unbeliefe,
mourne for it, and strive against
it.</p>
            <p>They hunger after the Word,
they love the Saints of God
dearely; they are very feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to offend God, and desire
to live an unblameable life, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Quest,</hi> How chanceth it
then seeing their faith is true


<pb n="196" facs="tcp:27910:105"/>
that it is so weake?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Alas there is small
need to aske this; for it is easie
to have weake faith, but hard
to have it strong.</p>
            <p>1. Some are but novices
newly converted, these being
infants must needs bee weake,
and have many turne-againes
and feares. And if it bee so, its
the better signe; for who can
looke it should bee otherwise?
doe any thinke a new borne
childe, or of a quarter old,
should goe alone? Christ
would have no burthens laid
on his yongue disciples, nor
strong new wine put into old
vessells.</p>
            <p>2. Some have small know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and therefore their faith
must needs be small, and they
held downe with many a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:
as the Disciples that
fled from their Master, because
they knew little to stay them.</p>
            <p>3. Some are not able to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scerne


<pb n="197" facs="tcp:27910:105"/>
of the comforts offered
them, and have no power to
apprehend the promise; which
is no wonder, for it is not a
small thing so to doe, as <hi>Samuel</hi>
at first discerned not Gods
voyce.</p>
            <p>4. Some want meanes: some
that attaine the publike, yet
neglect the private helpes of
secret prayer, reading and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation,
and so are weake.</p>
            <p>5. Some are so close that they
keepe all to themselves, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
not their doubts to some
godly Minister or experienced
Christian, and so they must
needs be weake the longer.
Some thinke they were never
humbled enough.</p>
            <p>6. Some thinke they see and
finde more corruption in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
than can bee in one that
is a beleever and the childe of
God: though herein they are
deceived; for the sight of it,
with hatred and resistance, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther


<pb n="198" facs="tcp:27910:106"/>
proves their faith.</p>
            <p>7. Some also walke not so
carefully, but are carryed too
much after the world: or fall
into this or that sin, and make
not hast out of it againe by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
and so weaken them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
            <p>Yet wee are to know, that
this weak faith, is true faith; as
<hi>1 Tim. 1. Faith unfamed, and like
pretious faith,</hi> they had with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the worthy Saints of God.
As precious, though not so
great; the same holy Ghost the
author; the same Gospell the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument,
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>Little faith is true faith, as
well as great, a little man is
a man as well as a great man,
a little water is as truely wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
as the Ocean Sea, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Disciples had true
Faith, and yet very weake;
weake in knowledge: though
they beleeved, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. that
he was the <hi>Messias,</hi> that should


<pb n="199" facs="tcp:27910:106"/>
save the world, yet how, they
could not tell: they were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of his death; for when he
told them of his sufferings,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 20. and <hi>Marke</hi> 9 34.
and <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 43. yet it is said
they understood not that
word, and <hi>Peter</hi> tooke his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
aside and counselled him
not to goe to Ierusalem to dye,<note place="margin">Mat. 16.</note>
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>They were ignorant also of
his resurrection; for when <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
told them of it they beleeved
it not.</p>
            <p>Of his ascension, <hi>Iohn</hi> 13 and
<hi>chapt.</hi> 14 when hee spake of a
little tarrying with them, and
then of his going away, they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
it not, they knew not
whither he went, they said, and
knew not the way. Now how
weake was this their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
to bee ignorant of such
maine Articles?</p>
            <p>Also they were ignorant of
Christs Kingdome, dreaming


<pb n="200" facs="tcp:27910:107"/>
of an earthly kingdome, and
desired to sit at his right and
left hand, &amp;c. Yea and in this
ignorance they continued even
after his Resurrection, as <hi>Act.</hi> 1.
Yea and as they were weake in
knowledge, so also in belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving;
and therefore fled all
from Christ. But weake Faith
may prove strong in time: the
learnedst Clerke was in his
horne book, the greatest Giant
was in swadling clouts, the
tallest Oake was a twigge,
and Faith groweth from a
graine of Mustard seede to a
tall tree: As from a childe to a
man, so corne groweth from a
weake blade to a stalke, and
eare, and ripe corne therein,
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Disciples,<note place="margin">Nicodemus</note> so weak before,
afterwards when the holy
Ghost was sent upon them, they
were exceeding strong, &amp; fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
not the faces of the Tyrants.
<hi>Peter</hi> that feared at a damsels


<pb n="201" facs="tcp:27910:107"/>
voice, after feared not the
whole Councill, <hi>Acts.</hi> 4. and
when God shall please to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
them as he doth some by
degrees in their health; some in
sickenesse, and some in death,
they are as strangely inlarged in
their Faith as in their length.</p>
            <p>If it never prove great, yet
weake Faith shall save; for it
interests us to Christ, and
makes him and all his benefits
ours: for its not the strength of
Faith that saves, but the truth
of our Faith; nor weaknesse of
Faith that condemnes, but the
want of Faith: for the least
Faith layeth hold on Christ,
and so will save us. Neyther
are wee saved by the worth or
quantity of our Faith: but by
Christ, which is laid hold on
by a weake Faith as well as a
strong. As a weake hand that
can put meate into the mouth,
shall feede and nourish the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
as well as if it were a strong


<pb n="202" facs="tcp:27910:108"/>
hand, seeing the body is not
nourisht by the strength of the
hand, but by the goodnesse of
the meate. As a weake Palsie
hand takes a gift of a Prince,
as well, though not so strongly
as another; so a weake belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
shall lay hold of enough to
serve his turne. A childe in the
armes can take a peece of gold
in the hand; a weake and little
eye can see the whole body of
the Sunne, as well as a great and
strong, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And so weake Faith shall
save as well as a stronger. As it
was in the beholding of the
brasen Serpent, whosoever
could looke up to it was cured:
all looked not with eies of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
strength; some were pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blinde,
some bleare-eyed, some
weake and dimme with age,
some with paine, yet whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
looked, though weakly, was
healed: so <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 16. it is not
said, who so beleeveth strongly,


<pb n="203" facs="tcp:27910:108"/>
but, Whosoever beleeveth shall
not perish, but have everlasting
life, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 12.</p>
            <p>And the weakest Faith shall
never faile or bee taken away:
God will not reject it. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
shall never overcome it,
nor did we ever reade that any
were rejected for their weake
Faith.</p>
            <p>Yet this must be understood
with good caution, lest any
should hence grow carelesse,
and say, Why then a little Faith
is as good as a great: what
neede so much paines? Oh no,
though none are rejected for
little Faith, yet some are repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
for it: Oh faithlesse genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
how long shall I, &amp;c.? O
ye of little Faith.</p>
            <p>It is a blemish to have small
Faith, especially after long time
or much meanes. And though a
weak Faith shall get to heaven,
yet with wonderfull difficulty,
especially if God send great


<pb n="204" facs="tcp:27910:109"/>
tryalls and changes, from health
to great sicknesse, sore paine,
long diseases, from wealth to
poverty; or if there be changes
in the Church or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
            <p>As if two were to goe a mile
up hill, one very able bodied,
good lungs and pectoralls; the
other weake and troubled with
the greene sicknesse, stopt in
the liver and splene, or having
ill lungs and in a consumption:
one goeth up stoutly and not
much bloweth, but holds out
strongly; the other ere he have
gone a quarter the way, pants
as if heart would burst, lookes
pale as if he would fall downe;
goes a while and sits downe,
feares hee shall never get up,
then creepes on hands and
knees, then beginnes againe a
little, then downe againe; at
last it may bee with great adoe
hee gets up, but not without
much doubt and difficulty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:27910:109"/>
And as if two Ships saile
together, the one strong and all
tackling sound and good, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
weake and full of holes,
both may get to the haven, but
one goeth singing and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently,
the other with much
feare of every wave that beates
against it, &amp;c. And when it lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,
they are faine to pumpe
out the water, and are affraid
lest it should sinke, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Therefore it is no wisedome,
for any to content themselves
with a weake faith: who
would be weake that might be
strong, poore that might bee
rich? For hee that hath but
weake faith, shall want the
comforts that a strong faith
hath, and be ready to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
away with every winde of
Doctrine. Hee shall be unset<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
and set backe by every
temptation, and bee very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meet
to resist great ones. Hee
will be ready to faint in every


<pb n="206" facs="tcp:27910:110"/>
crosse; unfit to doe any great
service, or to suffer any great
matter: be ever affraid of Death,
backward to his duty, have
no boldnesse to come into Gods
presence. Finally, none that
have weake faith can bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with that measure, if it be
true; seeing it is a note of all
true graces, that they are still
growing, from a graine of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard
seed to a great tree; from
a childe to a man. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they can have no assurance
that their faith is true, if being
small they are content with
that measure, and neglect the
meanes of their spirituall
growth.</p>
            <p>But the Lord of his great
goodnesse hath provided wayes
and meanes to be used, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
wee may grow from weake
faith to strong, from a seed to a
tall tree, from a Babe to a tall
man, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The use hereof is first for


<pb n="207" facs="tcp:27910:110"/>
those that have but a small and
weake faith, and yet may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scerne
by the notes and signes
of it, that they have a true
faith; let them not be discoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
but bee thankfull to God
highly for any, seeing most
part have none at all: and so
mightest thou with them have
perished. Againe, consider that
thy little faith is better than
the great brags of Hypocrites
and vaineglorious Pharisees.</p>
            <p>Yea, thy little faith is better
than all the world; more preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
than gold that perisheth,
though tryed never so much
and often in the fire: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be thankfull for it.</p>
            <p>Neither let the Divell make
thee beleeve that it is but a false
or a temporarie faith, and that
because thou hast so many
doubts, therefore thou shalt
altogether faile at last: no, the
Scriptures tell us as well of the
weake faith of the Disciples,


<pb n="208" facs="tcp:27910:111"/>
               <hi>Thomas, Peter,</hi> and <hi>Nicodemus,</hi>
as of the strong faith of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
Iob, Paul,</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> and
the three Children. This thy
weake faith, makes Christ
thine, and shall save thee. All
the gates of hell cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile
against it.</p>
            <p>Againe, this thy weake faith
may prove a strong and tall
faith; especially if thou beest
but a beginner. Then be not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged,
seeing every thing
must have a beginning: thou
mayest come to helpe and
strengthen others in time. And
though thou shouldst die by
and by, yet it should bring thee
to Heaven.</p>
            <p>Yet let none content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with a weake faith, but
having time and meanes, strive
for a greater; else wee can have
no assurance that wee have any
true faith. For, who having a
goodly living and but weake
assurance of it, desires not that


<pb n="209" facs="tcp:27910:111"/>
hee had better Deedes, and old
Evidences, and more writings
to hold by against all cavillers?
So who tasteth of a very good
sweet thing, but desireth more
of it? And so it is with them
that have the first beginnings
of spirituall graces.</p>
            <p>Who would live, alwayes in
a poore condition, if hee could
helpe it? and to have but from
hand to mouth, from one day
to another, and scant that; and
nor rather have of his owne
for all turnes in health and
sicknesse, yea and to helpe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that need, &amp;c?</p>
            <p>Who would bee continually
in feare, ready to bee unsettled
upon euery occasion? unfit to
doe God any great service? or
be ever unfit to doe any good?
or ever affraid of Death? What
a poore life is this?</p>
            <p>Alas, if great and strong
temptations come, thou must
indure long paines and sore.


<pb n="210" facs="tcp:27910:112"/>
If persecution come, what shall
a weake faith doe then? Alas
hee that hath but a groat in his
purse, canspend no more. Wee
provide not only for faire wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but for foule, Bootes and
Cloake, and Hood; yea, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
these with us, when it may
be wee have no need of them
at our going forth, but wee
know not what may fall
out, ere we come home againe.
It may be faire a few miles, and
a cleere skie without raine: but
after there may come foule
weather.</p>
            <p>What should the Martyres
have done, if they had beene
at this wavering stay? Yea
how uncomfortably doe wee
walke daily, by reason of this
weaknesse of faith through our
continuall doubts and feares?
besides that, our faith is made
the lesse fruitfull. And though
the divell cannot wholly
quench the least measure of


<pb n="211" facs="tcp:27910:112"/>
true Faith, yet he may so choak
it with the ashes of his temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
that it shall neither
shew light nor heate, &amp;c. Let
us therefore diligently use the
meanes of strengthning our
Faith; as the Ministery of the
Word, which is excellent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
other meanes: for as it
was ordained of God to beget
Faith, so to nourish it, 1. <hi>Pet.
2. 1. Ephes.</hi> 4. 11. and to edifie the
body of Christ: therefore the
Apostles returned backe by the
Churches w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>^ they had plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
to settle and confirme the
peoples hearts in the Faith. By
hearing the promises of the
Gospell laide open againe and
againe, yea and offred and
thrust upon us still, wee are not
onely kept in remembrance of
them, but are excited to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
them, and are much
strengthned thereby.</p>
            <p>Also thereby heare we more
of the nature of God, his mercy,


<pb n="212" facs="tcp:27910:113"/>
truth, unchangeablenes: also or
divers examples of Gods mercy
on others, &amp; of their Faith, &amp;c.
So also reading the Scriptures
by our selves is a good helpe:
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. Search them &amp; meditate
on the promises contained in
them, and this will bee a good
meanes, as <hi>David</hi> saith, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
us; Thy promise, saith he,
hath quickned mee,<note place="margin">Psal. 119.</note> &amp;c. But
our care must be that we reade
with consideration and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
Here I may adde this
point, what is the smalest mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of Faith that can bee, to
wit, when a man not being able
to apply the promises to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
and to say, I am perswaded
my sinnes bee forgiven, yet out
of a troubled heart doth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fainedly
desire the favour of
God above all the world. To
this thirsting, what promises be
made? <hi>Matth. 5. 6. Iohn</hi> 7. 37. It
is accepted with God for
Faith, &amp;c. and doth justifie


<pb n="213" facs="tcp:27910:113"/>
the sinner, seeing it is a weake
kinde of apprehension. But that
we doe not mistake our selves,
wee are to know that it is not
every kinde of desire, but that
which desireth the favour and
love of God more than heaven
and salvation. We see it in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid
Psal.</hi> 4 6. 7. and <hi>Psal. 31. 16.
Make thy face to shine upon thy
servant: Thy favour is better than
life, Psal.</hi> 63. 2. It is a vehement
desire, that cannot bee satisfied
without the thing desired: as a
woman longing, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 20.
40. as the Hart brayeth after
the rivers of water, <hi>Psal.</hi> 42. 1.
3. It is not by fits, but constant
till it obtaineth: as the hungry
man till hee get meate. 4. It is
joyned with a desire to obey
God, and hath good affections,
desiring to come under Gods
government, as well as to bee
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ardoned: whereas the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites
desire is cold and slight,
by fits and flashes, and severed


<pb n="214" facs="tcp:27910:114"/>
from the use of the meanes
whereby it might bee satisfied.</p>
            <p>The Sacraments likewise are
good helpes: As first the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Baptisme may streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
our Faith, seeing in it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of our sinnes is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
signified, but also sealed unto
us. Neyther is water more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall
for the washing away
of the filth of the body, than
the bloud of Christ thereby sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
to cleanse our soules
from the guilt and punishment
of all our sins.</p>
            <p>Secondly the Supper of the
Lord is of like efficacy to
strengthen our Faith, wherein
God hath put his Seale to his
Word, <hi>that by two immutable
things, wherein its impossible that
God should lie, wee might have
strong consolation, Heb.</hi> 6. 19.
Herein God not onely paints
out unto us Christ Iesus; so that
as the Apostle saith, wee may
see him as it were crucified


<pb n="215" facs="tcp:27910:114"/>
before our eies, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 1. but also
afresh exhibites and gives him
to us, and that every one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly;
yea and not darkely,
but in a very familiar manner,
under ordinary signes subject
to all our senses, whereby hee
would put us out of doubt, that
as verily as the Minister gives
unto us the outward signes, so
verily God gives unto us his
Sonne Christ with all his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites.
So that except wee bee
worse than <hi>Thomas,</hi> wee must
then beleeve, and bee made
stronger.</p>
            <p>So that God dealeth with us
as mothers who nurse their
yongue children; they lap them
up warme, and give them both
breasts, and so they grow up: so
is it betweene God and us.</p>
            <p>Another principall meanes
of Faith is earnest and devout
Prayer, wherby in secret we beg
it of God: for though it is
not the first meanes of getting


<pb n="216" facs="tcp:27910:115"/>
Faith, (for wee cannot pray in
Faith, till wee have Faith) yet
our Saviour Christ hath taught
us, by praying for <hi>Peter</hi> that
his Faith should not faile, how
we should get our Faith increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and established. So the man,
<hi>Marke 9. 24. Lord helpe my unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
and the Disciples, <hi>Lord in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
our Faith.</hi> If wee aske
the holy Ghost, it shall be given
us, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 13. and how much
more the graces and gifts of
the holy Spirit? <hi>Iohn</hi> 16. 23.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, often medi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ate of
the unchangeablenesse of God
in his promises in themselves,
to others, and to our selves, and
the experiences that wee have
had of Gods goodnesse to us,
and of the truth of our hearts
to him.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, society and confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
with our fellow-bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren;
especially some experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced
Christian or faithfull Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister,
and revealing unto them


<pb n="217" facs="tcp:27910:115"/>
our doubts, is a notable meanes.
For they may much confirme
us by their counsells and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations
fetched out of the
Word, and by their owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
laid before us; for it
availes much to our comfort to
heare that others have beene
in our case, and yet now strong
in Faith. As its in bodily ailes,
so in the spirituall, &amp; <hi>Iob 4. 3. 4.
Rom.</hi> 14. 1. Oh there may bee
much good gotten this way,
and especially by visiting the
sicke, and beholding the faith
and zealous resolution of any
in trouble, paines, death, impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment,
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, fruitfulnesse in good
workes is a notable meanes to
strengthen Faith, when we bee
plentifull in well doing, ready
to every good word and worke
in our generall and particular
calling, to God, to men, &amp;c. For
as the Sunne heates a wall, and
being heat, it beates, backe, and


<pb n="218" facs="tcp:27910:116"/>
increaseth the heat of the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beames;
so Faith brings forth
good works, &amp; good works in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
Faith: for they be strong
arguments to us of the truth
and soundnesse of our Faith;
and therefore the Apostle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth
unto them, 1. <hi>Cor. 15.
Wherefore be stedfast and unmove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
alwayes abounding in the
worke of the Lord.</hi> This being
added as a meanes to make us
stedfast. A barren life can never
have a stedfast Faith: Also
walke close with God, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
in one thing as in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
not taking liberty to
breake off our Christian course
and communion with God
when we list: but we must hold
fast, awaking with God, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
with him all day, locking
to our hearts and waies at
home, abroad, alone, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
in prosperity, in adversity,
and so when wee lye downe at
night making even reckonings.


<pb n="219" facs="tcp:27910:116"/>
And if wee faile in any thing,
we must humble our selves, and
crave pardon, and never cease
till wee be reconciled.</p>
            <p>On the other side, if we can
walke carelesly, and divers
dayes or weekes want our
communion with God, our
faith will be weake; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
walking with God bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
strong faith. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we are to be exhorted to
the use of these meanes. And
the lazinessc of many Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
is justly to be rebuked, who
are content with a weake faith
long together, and that when
they enjoy the meanes of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting more.</p>
            <p>If they can but prove they
have any faith at all, they much
wrong themselves, in not loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
for increase.</p>
            <p>Oh how ill doe these provide
for themselves! If God should
lay greater tryalls on them
than they bee fit to beare, and


<pb n="220" facs="tcp:27910:117"/>
they be at their wits ends, it
were just; seeing he need not to
fit their trialls to the strength
they have, but to that which
they might have had.</p>
            <p>But if wee have used all
meanes carefully, then let us
content our selves with that
portion which God will give
us, and assure our selves, that
he will never try us beyond
that he will enable us to beare,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 13.</p>
            <p>Strong faith,<note place="margin">Strong Faith.</note> is when a man
is full of knowledge of the
Scriptures, and so able to resist
and meet with temptation laid
against him; and withall is
strong in apprehension of the
love of God, and his promises:
so that having got hold, he will
not be beat off, nor let goe, but
holds firme and fast; so as you
may as well wring a club out of
a Giants hand: as it is said of
<hi>Romanus,</hi> none could wring the
staffe of faith out of his hand.


<pb n="221" facs="tcp:27910:117"/>
So <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 13. the Angell of the
Church of Pergamus could not
be drawne to deny the faith,
though hee dwelled where Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans
throne was.</p>
            <p>Yea, hee that is strong in
faith, so beleeves the promise
of salvation, as hee is fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
of it, and that Christ
loved him, and gave himselfe
for him; that there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
to him: yea with
<hi>Paul,</hi> that neither life nor
death, Angels nor principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
and <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 38. 39. Hee
beleeves also the other promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
firmely of protection and
defence, though much bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
against it, as <hi>David,</hi> that
<hi>God was his shield, rocke, strong
tower; and though an Hoast pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
against him, Psal.</hi> 27. 1. yet
because God had promised that
he should be King after <hi>Saul,</hi> he
beleeved none could prevaile
against him. So likewise hee
saith, <hi>Psal. 23. 4. Though I walke


<pb n="222" facs="tcp:27910:118"/>
through the valley of the shadow
of death, I will feare no evill:</hi> and
<hi>Psal.</hi> 2. 1. he sheweth that which
also himselfe beleeved, that all
the oppositions of men were
but <hi>in vaine</hi> against him.</p>
            <p>So when all goes against him,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> he beleeves God cannot
forsake his. And so <hi>Iob, Though
hee kill mee, yet I will trust in him.
Iob</hi> 13. 15. Thus <hi>Asa, 2 Chro.</hi> 14.
though there were so great
oddes against him, yet hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved;
and so also <hi>Iehoshaphat.</hi>
So that God will defend his, as
wee see in the example of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi>
and the three Children,
who beleeved euen above be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe,
and so were delivered.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Mordecay, Ester</hi> 4. 14.
beleeved strongly, that though
the likeliest meanes should
faile, yet God would raise up
deliverance to his people (to
whom he had made covenant)
some other way.</p>
            <p>The Martyrs likewise had


<pb n="223" facs="tcp:27910:118"/>
this strong faith, as shee that
said, <hi>If you take away my meate,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Elizabeth Young.</note>
               <hi>God will take away my hunger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So the two yongue <hi>Davyes</hi>
that answered their father, <hi>If
God send us no meate, he will send
us no hunger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And others that forsooke all,
and said with <hi>Paul, Act, 20. 24.
Neither count I my life deare
unto my selfe, so that I may finish
my course with joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such a faith was in Doctor
<hi>Taylour</hi> that said, <hi>hee mised but
two stiles before be should he at his
fathers house: also, Wee shall have
a sharpe breakefast, but a joyfull
dinner,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This strong faith is not got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
at once,<note place="margin">Not gotten at once.</note> nor at first; but as
the bodily stature is by insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
degrees, so and much more
is the spirituall growth of faith,
not runne up at once in a night,
as <hi>Ionahs</hi> gourd, but by degrees,
and after good time and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
in the use of the


<pb n="224" facs="tcp:27910:119"/>
meanes after frequent witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
of Gods spirit. After
many experiences of the truth
of our owne hearts to God in
hatred of all wickednesse, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
profitable and pleasing
sinnes, doing painefull duties
constantly, and such as we have
had no thanke for our labour in
doing of them; these prove to
our selves, that wee are the
Lords: After many bicker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and combats, and after
many experiences of the love
of God to us, of his presence
with us, hearing our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
defending and delivering
us, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This strong faith is not of a
novice, but of a valiant Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion.
Experience breeds hope
that maketh not ashamed: as
<hi>David</hi> by experience of killing
a Beare and a Lyon grew reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute,
he should kill <hi>Goliah;</hi> and
<hi>Paul, 2 Cor. 1. 10. Who hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
us from so great a death,


<pb n="225" facs="tcp:27910:119"/>
and doth deliver us, in whom wee
trust hee will yet deliver us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Souldier at first is fearfull;
but after upon experience of
many victories and escapes he
groweth couragious. So we.</p>
            <p>And God seeth not fit to give
a yongue beginner a full assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;
for it would bee to him
as a great sayle to a little ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell,
to pull him under water:
his corruption would take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
hereby of hurt; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hee bringeth men to it as
they be able to beare it.</p>
            <p>Now that we may the better
discerne it, I will here set
downe some notes of a strong
faith: and first,<note place="margin">Notes.</note> hee hath peace,
yea an habituate peace with
God, peace that passeth under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
and joy of the holy
Ghost; and this the Apostle
prayeth for, <hi>Rom. 15. 13. The
God of hope fill you with all joy
and peace in beleeving.</hi> So that
fulnesse of faith breeds fuln<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

Father It breeds love, yea
great love to God, for <hi>faith
worke; by love, Gal.</hi> 5. 6. So the
Apostle, <hi>The love of Christ con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straineth
us, 2 Cor.</hi> 5. 14. Yea the
top of love, that is, zeale for the
glory of God.</p>
            <p>Another signe is fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in good workes and well
doing; and constant close wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
with God.</p>
            <p>Strong faith is not carryed
away; though never so many
and so great ones teach contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
or labour to remove the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever,
yet he is settled, stabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
and rooted in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and love of the truth: he
is not to choose his Religion;
no, hee hath gone to worke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
better grounds than so.</p>
            <p>Hee contemneth the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion


<pb n="227" facs="tcp:27910:120"/>
of multitudes, customes,
examples, and let never so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
bee of another minde or
course, they move not him:
though they wonder at him
like an owle, hee can pity them
upon good ground, and in
Faith. When some baite at him,
some perswade and pity him,
and wish his eies were opened,
and, wee wish you good, yet
is not he unsettled: As we see in
<hi>Elias,</hi> who stood firme though
there were foure hundred false
Prophets against him and the
people.</p>
            <p>So amongst the holy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,
some poore women have
stood out against all the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
that opposed them.
They are not shaken by the
Apostacy of such as have
beene great Professors or
Preachers, 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 19. For
none are fallen but the childe
of perdition. Therefore they
are not unsettled, though many


<pb n="228" facs="tcp:27910:121"/>
fall away, yea Professors or
Teachers.</p>
            <p>A strong Faith despiseth the
offers of profites, pleasures, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
to forsake his Religion;
he will not be enticed and tolld
away like a dogge with a crust,
he hath assurance of other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of things already, which
hee will not lose for all the
world: as wee see in <hi>Moses,</hi>
who refused to bee called the
sonne of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> daughter:
and as for reproaches, troubles,
persecution, hee cares not for
them; if they come and
threaten prison, fire, faggot,
this stirres not him, he is resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and <hi>is as Mount Sion that
cannot be moved, but standeth fast
for ever,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Psal. 125. 1. He endureth
the crosse and despiseth the shame,</hi>
and saith with <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 20. 24<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> 
               <hi>my life is not
dear to me: And I am not only rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to be bound, but to die at Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem
for the Name of the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
Act,</hi> 21. 13. He stickes to


<pb n="229" facs="tcp:27910:121"/>
the Word, and builds not on
man; therefore though others
fall away, yet hee stands fast. As
the woman that being told her
fellow prisoner was altered and
of another minde: If shee be,
saith shee, I built my Faith not
on her, or any other, but upon
Gods Word, and that is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
I am sure.</p>
            <p>If hee have a promise from
God, though all seeme to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it, yet hee relies upon it:
though it bee delayed, yet hee
waites, and saith, though <hi>It
tarry, wait, and it will surely come,
it will not tarry, Hab.</hi> 2. 3. Hee
feares not troubles, but knowes
all comes through his fathers
hand, and that man and devill
cannot doe what they would:
and therefore hee goeth on
comfortably to day, to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
and to the end. In his
worldly dealings, which are of
most weight, hee useth the
meanes and depends upon


<pb n="230" facs="tcp:27910:122"/>
God for successe. If he be in
trouble, he hastens not out by
unlawfull meanes; as <hi>David</hi>
would not kill <hi>Saul</hi> to shorten
his troubles, nor hasten the
Kingdome to himselfe.</p>
            <p>If hee have small or no
meanes, yet having Gods
Word for him, he is not discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged,
as <hi>Asa, Ionathan,</hi> and
his armour bearer, and <hi>Ioshua</hi>
compassing Iericho; his heart
is fixed, hee beleeves in the
Lord, hee will not feare; and
if heaven and earth should goe
together, yet (as <hi>David</hi>) hee
would say, <hi>Psal. 27. 3. The Lord
is my light and salvation, whom
shall I feare? &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Simeons
nunc dimittis,</hi> and <hi>Stephens</hi> prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<hi>Act. 7. 59. Lord Iesus receive
my spirit.</hi> Hee can thinke of
death without any prevailing
feare, and of the grave, saying
with <hi>Paul, I desire to be dissolved,
Philip.</hi> 1. 23. He lookes beyond
the grave to a joyfull resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:27910:122"/>
So he can thinke of the day
of judgement, and say, Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Lord Iesus: and though
it be the terrour, or may bee of
the world; yea and weake
Christians shake at it, yet hee
feares it not, but can thinke of
it with joy.</p>
            <p>This is a most excellent
thing: Any Faith is a jewell
unvaluable, but a strong Faith
carries a man through the
world like a Conquerour, as
our Saviour Christ saith. <hi>Mark.
9. 23. All things are possible to
him that beleeveth.</hi> What a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
thing it is for a man to live
in such a continued constant
peace with God, boldnesse in
his presence &amp; inward joy! Its
a corner of heaven to bee zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
for God in a mans place,
to be fruitfull and abundant in
good workes, able and ready
to comfort many and support
the weake, to live without a
slavish fear of God or his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,


<pb n="232" facs="tcp:27910:123"/>
to stand immoveable
when others be shaken, to be
without fear of death or judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and to bee eased in all
ones matters, living by Faith;
when meanes be used, then to
be quiet.</p>
            <p>The strong beleever is as
<hi>Sampson;</hi> hee breakes all bands
of temptation, as straw, layes
heapes upon heapes: he is like
one of <hi>Davids</hi> Worthies, like
<hi>David</hi> himselfe, that having
got experience feares nothing;
hee walkes up and downe the
world like a Giant, higher by
head and shoulders than most
men, with a strong shield in his
hand that the devill himselfe
cannot pierce, but it quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his fiery darts, and also get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
victory against the world
by his Faith, breakes through
an hoast, and leaps over a wall,
breakes a bow of steele. It is as
farre better than a weake Faith,
as a rich mans case, that hath


<pb n="233" facs="tcp:27910:123"/>
for all needs; for dyet: as if his
minde stands not to one thing,
hee hath another: so in his
beer, or if need be can call for a
cup of wine; so for his appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell,
as the weather is: hee hath
in time of sicknesse wherewith
to send for a Physitian; hee
hath for all needes, he can give
to one and lend to another. If
he list not to goe afoote, he can
take his horse. And great oddes
there is betweene such a state,
and of a poore man that hath
for meer necessity, from hand to
mouth, and that very barely;
and alas, wanting many things,
would bee glad to have those
things which would relieve his
necessity. Or such a difference
there is between them, as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the case of a harty strong
man that can goe, ride, worke,
travell, and is hearty without
complaint, &amp; another that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
goe two or three miles, but
is so faint and distempered, that


<pb n="234" facs="tcp:27910:124"/>
hee is the worse after it a good
while; or a woman that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
put out her selfe for faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
or if shee doe a little, it is
with much trouble, and hath
many ailes and complaints.</p>
            <p>The Vse is,<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> that every man
try whether he have this strong
Faith; and the rather, because
there be some that thinke they
have it, who are but like rogues,
that have a counterfeit passe,
made by themselves or some
other in an ale-house, or under
a hedge.</p>
            <p>There bee some that having
stept out of a lewd and bad
course, and being stung a little
with the terrours of the Law,
presently have fallen to lay
hold of the promise, and so all
at once have been so fully assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
as they have had no
doubts. They imagine that
they are able to deale with any
body, and thinke themselves fit
and able to controll &amp; censure
any.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="235" facs="tcp:27910:124"/>
These make more hast than
good speed, they fly ere they
haue wings, and are like a
swaggering fellow with Beere
in his crowne, who it may bee,
as soone as he is out of his Inne,
falls a galloping, and leaves o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men behinde, but ere hee
hath ridde seven or eight mile,
his horse is tyred, and those
whom hee had outstript, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
him, and get to their Inne
in peace and good time, when
as he is abroad in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
            <p>The Bird that ventures out
of the neast ere she hath wings,
the Kite or Buzzard catcheth
her; so the divell desires no
better booty, than such a proud
over-hasty person: for as wee
have seene by experience, they
not knowing themselves, nor
the corruptions of their owne
hearts, nor having had experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of Sathans temptations,
he pulls them either into some


<pb n="236" facs="tcp:27910:125"/>
odde opinion, or else into some
foule sinne, as to uncleannesse,
covetousnesse, or such like.
Howsoever, some of those, as I
have noted, have by their sinne
beene humbled, and begun bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and so in time have come
to somewhat, when they had
paid full dearely for their hast.</p>
            <p>Some never came to good, but
as their Gourd sprung in a
night, so it perished and withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in another.</p>
            <p>Is it not monstrous for a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
a yongue childe new borne
to be a man? saw you ever a
childe borne with a beard, or
all his teeth? yet this is the like
case.</p>
            <p>If a childe new borne should
scramble out of the Midwifes
hand, and runne about the
chamber, would it not scare all
the company? So is it with
these that will make such great
haste.</p>
            <p>These bee like some proud


<pb n="237" facs="tcp:27910:125"/>
yongue man, that hath bought
out some of his yeares, impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
of service, and will set up,
and have a shop as good as his
Masters, (the first day) who
hath beene a shop-keeper these
twentie yeares, and not having
stocke, takes it up of trust, or
borrowes upon usurie, and
within a few yeares hee is
blowne up for debt.</p>
            <p>Another that served out his
time, and knew what belonged
to it, hee sets up with a little of
his owne, with one or two of
the commodities that belong
to his trade, and waites upon
God, and gets up by little and
little, and his shop mends eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
yeare.</p>
            <p>Some other ignorant and
carnall people will say, they are
fully perswaded of their salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
oh, no man can make them
blanke: but try these by the
notes before spoken of, and
there is no such love to God,


<pb n="238" facs="tcp:27910:126"/>
zeale to his glory, fruitfulnesse
in good life, no such comfortra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse
in affliction; but though
they be very bold and full of
comfort in prosperity, yet they
are soone nipt in the head in
affliction: like a base swaggerer
that makes a stirre in an Ale-house
with great words, as if he
were some Champion, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sent to warres, or dealt with
by a man indeed, his heart
failes him; so these when they
are put to the tryall their
hearts faile, and when death
and danger appeareth, they are
affraid to die. And such againe
as were never seene to give a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
such regard to the Word,
or any carefull attendance on
it, or the Sacrament, or any
good company; their strong
faith, is but strong presumption,
it will not abide the touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone.</p>
            <p>If any have this strong faith
indeed, let them enjoy it, they


<pb n="239" facs="tcp:27910:126"/>
have that that few have: and let
them nourish it by the meanes,
by fruitfulnesse in well doing,
and keepe close to God, and get
more to it; for the time may
come, that all may bee little
enough. <hi>David</hi> as much as he
had, yet had none to spare: and
if <hi>Iob</hi> had had a little more
faith and patience then he had,
it would have done no hurt.</p>
            <p>Now the meanes whereby
wee may increase from a weake
to a strong faith, are, first, with
all diligence and care to attend
on the meanes, publike and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
as hearing the Word,
prayer, receiving the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
reading, meditation and
holy conferences.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the often experience
of Gods love shining in all his
benefites: which being careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
observed, will assure us
firmely of the continuance of
it, seeing he is immutable and
unchangeable in his goodnesse.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="240" facs="tcp:27910:127"/>
Thirdly, wee must daily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
our love towards God
by our obedience, both active
and passive, being ready to doe
&amp; suffer any thing for his sake.
For our love towards him will
assure us of his love towards us,
seeing it is an inseparable fruit,
and effect of it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, wee must carefully
maintaine our communion
with God, and walke close
with him, carrying our selves
holily and righteously, as in his
sight and presence. And if
through frailty wee step away,
wee must recover our selves
speedily, and rise out of our
sinne by unfained repentance,
and so renew our covenant
with God, by renewing our
faith in his gracious promises.
Fiftly, wee must often and
seriously meditate on Gods sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
attributes, as his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
mercy, omnipotencie, and
truth in his promises, and on


<pb n="241" facs="tcp:27910:127"/>
the all-sufficiencie of Christs
merits and obedience, which
are the foundations upon
which our faith is built, and
will never faile us, though wee
faile in many things on our
part. Lastly, we must bee fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in well-doing, and in the
practice of all Christian duties
towards God, our neighbours,
and our selves; for a barren life
and a strong faith cannot stand
together.</p>
            <p>Now let such of us as bee
without it stirre up our selves
to use these meanes whereby
we may attaine unto it, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
the excellencie of it,
and what need wee may have
of it, and labour to come to it,
especially seeing God gives us
meanes of much faith.</p>
            <p>Let us strive to attaine unto
the best measure, and to exceed
our selves. This strong faith is
so excellent and needfull a
thing, that the Apostle prayeth


<pb n="242" facs="tcp:27910:128"/>
for it, for the Ephesians, and
commends it in the Thessaloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
that their faith did grow
daily, and exhorts the Colossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
unto it, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 7. Againe,
consider that hereby wee shall
give and bring much glory to
God, many wayes, as might bee
shewed: and that wee shall
provide wonderfully well for
our selves, and shall doe much
good many wayes to others.
This world is opposite against
goodnesse, therefore if we will
hold on zealously, we must get
strong faith. Besides, we know
not what we may meete with.
Folkes provide not for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
or forepart of their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
only, but for time to come,
and therefore they weare
Bootes, and carry a Cloake, and
Hood, when they have no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
need of them, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what weather may come.</p>
            <p>In the next place let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,<note place="margin">So Faith perfect.</note>
that though there bee a


<pb n="243" facs="tcp:27910:128"/>
strong faith, yet there is none
perfect and without temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but with some doubtings.
They that have the strongest
faith, may be assayled some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
though usually they
quell them; and sometimes they
may somewhat disquiet and
hurt them, and yet afterwards
turne to their good. The
healthfull man, may yet be sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
with two or three fits of
an Ague, that may make him
take to his cap; and doubting is
not mixt with his faith, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it opposeth it.</p>
            <p>For Faith is of the spirit,
and the regenerate part, doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
is of the flesh, and part
unregenerate, and they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
fight the one against the
other. And the divell also will
watch his time to oppose it.
Neither can there bee any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
faith, because wee know
but in part, and therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
but in part,<hi>Cor,</hi> 13. 12.


<pb n="244" facs="tcp:27910:129"/>
Some remnant of corruption
and of unbeleefe will remaine,
in some more, in some lesse.
and though usually faith get the
mastery of doubting, yet some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the divell or our unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe
will watch a time to doe
us a scare. The Flesh lusteth
against the Spirit, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
against the Flesh, <hi>Galat. 5. 17.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though <hi>Abraham</hi> were the
father of beleevers, yet by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
of <hi>Sarah</hi> he tooke <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>Rebeccah</hi> beleeved <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>
should have the blessing,
and God would have it so; yet
seeing <hi>Esau</hi> so neere it, her
Faith failed, and shee holpe it
forwards with a lye.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> likewise who so
strongly beleeved, as appeares
in the <hi>Psalmes,</hi> and by his reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion
not to meddle with
<hi>Saul,</hi> yet 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 2 7. 1. his
Faith failes, so that <hi>he said in his
heart, I shall now perish one day by


<pb n="245" facs="tcp:27910:129"/>
the hand of Saul,</hi> though hee had
Gods promise to the contrary:
and said <hi>in his haste all men are
lyars, Psal.</hi> 116. 11.</p>
            <p>Oh, great difficulties or long
delaies, bee often the foiles of
Faith, and will try a strong
Faith. <hi>Iobs</hi> Faith failed him
when he cursed his day: <hi>Moses</hi>
his Faith quailed at the Rocke:
<hi>Eliah</hi> would bee dead, that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
beleever, who had raised
the dead and shut up heaven:
<hi>Asa,</hi> whose faith was great, 2.
<hi>Chron.</hi> 14. yet <hi>chapt.</hi> 16. his faith
failed foully.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Martha</hi> beleeved that if
Christ had beene there, <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
had not dyed, yea and that
he should rise againe at the last
day; yet when our Saviour
Christ went to the Sepulchre,
and bid put away the stone, as
going to raise him,<note place="margin">Ioh. 11.</note> Oh Master
(saith she) hee stinketh: as
though he had not been as able
to raise him from the dead, as


<pb n="246" facs="tcp:27910:130"/>
to preserve him from death
whilest he was living.</p>
            <p>Sometimes God will leave
his to a temptation, to shew
them what they bee in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
and therefore judge not
any rashly in whom we have or
may see some weakenesse: they
may be excellent beleevers, and
shall recover themselves again.
If thou see any in time of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
recant, yet judge them
not, tarry but a while, and yee
shall see one come within a
few dayes and renounce his
recantation, and burne that
hand first that wrote it; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
going into the Church,
and casting downe the host, and
cutting off the Priests hand in
revenge of himselfe for recan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
            <p>Let therefore those that
have such a faith,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> as they have
no doubting, nor never had,
(which is the case of divers)
know, that they never beleeved


<pb n="247" facs="tcp:27910:130"/>
that never doubted. A man
were as good say, he were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and without any remnant
of corruption. When many of
Gods faithfull servants with
much labour and many feares,
have got a poore faith, have
they got a perfect one they
know not how? no, such a faith
is too cheape to be good.</p>
            <p>2. Againe if we have held
the assurance of Gods love
firmely a good while, yet if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it come to be set upon with
doubting, marvell not, nor bee
discouraged. Nay if you resist
and ovecome, it is a good
signe of a strong faith; for he is
not knowne to be a strong man
that was never set upon, but he
that hath had strong adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and yet got the day.</p>
            <p>3. Moreover, never make
account that the Bridegrome
shall ever be with us, but that a
time will come when hee shall
bee taken from us. Therefore


<pb n="248" facs="tcp:27910:131"/>
as the Mariner in a calme looks
and prepares for a storme, so
let us use like wisedome in
this case: our faith shall then
appeare when it is so tryed.</p>
            <p>4. Finally, doe not rashly
judge of such from whom
thou hearest some impatient
speeches, while they were
minding their paine; or some
doubtfull speech, as, Doe you
thinke God will heare me? that
I am his? that I shall hold out
to the end? For did not <hi>David</hi>
use some such weaknesse? judge
them by their usuall speeches
and behaviour, and thinke if
thou wert in his or her clothes,
that thou shouldest shew much
more. Many have stood strong
in some temptation, and after
have shewed weaknesse in farre
lesse. We must not think hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of any of Gods servants, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
or Christians, that shew
at a time some weaknesse: judge
them not, they will judge


<pb n="249" facs="tcp:27910:131"/>
themselves fast enough.</p>
            <p>On the other side, if any
now after much heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and long and earnest
seeking, have got fast hold, and
are now full of comfort, yet doe
not promise you shall ever hold
it thus, or ever be at the top, or
that it will ever bee full sea. Say
not as <hi>David, I shall never bee
moved, Psal.</hi> 30. 6. lest if doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
come againe, wee call all
into question. No by no meanes,
if you doubt of Gods favour,
say that you never made any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
account, and make use of
your former comforts, and hold
by them. Resist and you shall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome,
and know that ever
and anon such things will bee:
yea you may be set upon on the
death bed, as divers have had
combates; sometimes after the
Word or deep meditation of
Gods mercies, or after the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament;
how strong and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
doe you feele your selves?


<pb n="250" facs="tcp:27910:132"/>
Oh how you could doe any
thing for God, even go through
the fire, yet it may not alwayes
be thus.</p>
            <p>Nay lastly, take notice of a
worse point yet,<note place="margin">Strong faith may be weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> to wit, that a
strong faith may not only have
some doubtings, but may bee
shrewdly oppresled, yea much
diminished, at least in respect
of the acts and operations of
it. Hee that had a strong faith,
may come to have but a weake
faith, and so he may die (in his
owne sense, at least in outward
appearance) in a far worse case
than hee was sometimes in his
life: or so hee may handle the
matter, as he may recover him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
againe, as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi>
did, whose faith suffered
shrewd Eclypses, yet got up
againe in time. But <hi>Asa,</hi> I
am perswaded in his latter
daies, was in worse case much,
than formerly he had beene in.
Wee see the first part of his


<pb n="251" facs="tcp:27910:132"/>
raigne much commended, the
latter much worse: and much
unbeleefe he shewed, as 2. <hi>Chro.</hi>
16. in hiring the King of Aram,
trusting in Physitians, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Prophet into prison.
This is a pitifull thing, like a
Crab to goe backward. Some of
weake have become strong, but
of strong to become weake is
a heavie case; as for a man
from wealth to fall to a poore
condition. For as one that hath
been rich can worse endure po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
than they that never
knew other; so hee that hath
beene wont to have peace with
God, joy and life to good due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
can hardly beare the want
of them.</p>
            <p>Now the causes hereof may
be,<note place="margin">Causes or meanes.</note> either want of the meanes
which are taken from him, or
he gone from them; no profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
or usuall Ministry of the
Word; the Sucraments but
once or twice a yeare admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred


<pb n="252" facs="tcp:27910:133"/>
and received, no good
company: shut up a strong man,
and dye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> him thus, and his
strength will soone abate.</p>
            <p>2. A second cause is falling
into some foule sinne, and not
hasting out of it, but lying in it,
as <hi>David, 2. Sam.</hi> 12. or a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
giving way to ones cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
not lamenting, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting,
or reforming them. As
fruitfulnesse in good workes
strengthens faith; so barrennes
weakens it.</p>
            <p>3. A third cause is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuously
to get out of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
by unlawfull meanes,
weakens the faith shrewdly,
especially not hasting out of it
by through repentance.</p>
            <p>4. A fourth cause is love of
the world, and multitude of
dealings: many that at thirty,
and a while after were in good
case, after fall to great dealings,
have many farmes, or have the
world comming in in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,


<pb n="253" facs="tcp:27910:133"/>
and so doe wofully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
and faile: I have heard of
many in their yonguer dayes,
that have seemed very zealous
and full of grace, who have
shrewdly abated in their later
times.</p>
            <p>Now the signes of it,<note place="margin">Signes.</note> are
sleepinesse of heart, no life in
Christian duties, some times
use of the meanes, but with no
zeale. How did <hi>David</hi> doe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
all that three quarters after
his fearefull falls? much like
the poore Christian who gave
thankes, when he went to eate
of his stolen mutton.</p>
            <p>Another signe is the staying
of the sensible worke of Gods
Spirit.</p>
            <p>Likewise a continuall discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
unquietnesse of minde
and conscience; no minde to
the company of the people of
God;</p>
            <p>Feare of death, the which is
a fearefull estate, whilest the


<pb n="254" facs="tcp:27910:134"/>
poore Christian liveth in it,
howsoever God of his free
mercy, at last recovereth him
out of it.</p>
            <p>What then,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> is there no helpe
or remedie for this? God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
we should say so. That God
that pardoned at first, can and
will have mercy upon him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
though he have plaid the
prodigall: for the love of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reaches farre. But yet it
will cost him the setting on.
As if a father set up his sonne
the second time, it it will bee
with some checkes, and upon
his humble suite, and it may be
he must bring some of his kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
to plead and intreate for
him: So is it with the poore
Christian in this case.</p>
            <p>They then that have suffered
this losse, had need make a ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering,
&amp; get many good Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
and Christians to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
their prayers and counsels
to helpe them up againe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="255" facs="tcp:27910:134"/>
For it is possible to bee reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
(as we see in the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>David</hi>) though with
much adoe, as appeareth <hi>Psal.</hi>
51. therefore be carefull to see
continually what hath cast you
behinde hand: Daily judge
your selves for your sinnes, till
you feele your heart relent and
waxe tender in some sort: get
under the dropping of a profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
and settled ministerie.</p>
            <p>Vse the helpe of the Lords
Supper: and if ordinary meanes
prevaile not, adde thereunto
extraordinary; shake off too
much dealings, and the delight
of the world. And when thou
art once recovered, walke more
watchfully and warily ever
after.</p>
            <p>Some have thus recovered
themselves; some that in their
time were excellent, have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
very obscure, and much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe
they have had to crawle to
heaven, that if they had beene


<pb n="256" facs="tcp:27910:135"/>
taken away twelve or sixteene
yeares before, would have gone
with full sayle. And this may
be a cause why God therefore
takes away so many, when they
be at the best.</p>
            <p>Secondly, let them not that
yet hold their owne, bee high
minded, but walke in feare.
Beware of these things before
spoken of; else you may fall
from you excellencie.</p>
            <p>Cling to God, be constant in
the meanes, that so you may
never know what belongeth to
this wofull state: for as some
die in it with little comfort,
and have much adoe to bee
comforted on their death-beds,
so some have recovered, but it
hath cost them deare first.</p>
            <p>And thus having spoken of
the nature and degrees of
Faith, I will in the next place
speake of the properties of it.
And first I will shew the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie
of Faith. And this might


<pb n="257" facs="tcp:27910:135"/>
be shewed first by the Author
of it, in that it is not the worke
of Nature, or of our selves, nor
yet of man or Angell, but of
God only. But of this I have
already spoken.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it might bee shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the difficultie of obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
it but of this I shall have
occasion to speake hereafter.
And also by the rarenesse of it,
in that few ever have beene
true beleevers, <hi>Esa. 53. 1. And
when the Sonne of man shall come,
shall bee finde faith upon the earth?
Luk.</hi> 18. 8.</p>
            <p>But I will not insist upon any
of these, but rather shew it by
other arguments. And first by
that honour which God hath
put upon it. Secondly, by the
unspeakable benefits which
by it are derived unto us.
Thirdly, by this that it brings
much honour to God, and is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
very profitable unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="258" facs="tcp:27910:136"/>
First, God hath highly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
it, in that he hath made
it the only instrument of our
salvation, there being no other
condition of the Covenant of
Grace, but beleeving, <hi>Ioh. 3. 16.
Marc. 16. 16. &amp;c.</hi> And whereas
there are many other excellent
graces, yet none of them are
appointed to apply Christ, and
to be the instrument of our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
but faith only. And
whereas the greatest venture in
the world, is the comming of
our soules safely unto heaven,
of this, faith assureth us, and
that upon good, yea the best se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie,
namely the Word and
faithfulnesse of God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is that whereby
Christ Iesus and all his benefits
are made ours; whereof it is
said <hi>Rom. 5. 1. Wee are justified by
faith, viz.</hi> Christs righteousnesse
made ours by faith. As our sins
were made his by imputation;
and he bare the burthen of


<pb n="259" facs="tcp:27910:136"/>
them, so his sufferings and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
are made ours, and
we justified thereby, <hi>Hab. 2. 4.
The just shall live by faith.</hi> As
without faith we have nothing
to doe with Christ, so by this
he and all his benefits are veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and truely made ours: and is
not this an excellent thing that
intitles us and puts us into pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of Christ Iesus and all
his benefits? It is more than if
wee had beene a kin to Christ,
had had him in our armes, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in his company, than if we
had heard him daily, had eate
and drunke with him; nay than
to have been his mother, sister,
or brother, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 48. 49.</p>
            <p>By faith our persons are
made pleasing to God, and our
workes acceptable: for while
wee bee in our owne filthinesse,
God cannot abide us, and our
best workes are abominable.</p>
            <p>It is said that God had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to <hi>Abel</hi> and to his work,


<pb n="260" facs="tcp:27910:137"/>
and that by faith hee offered a
better and more acceptable sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
than <hi>Cain:</hi> his might be
as good for the outside, but <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells</hi>
was accepted, because it
was done in faith by a beleever,
the imperfections thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taken away in Christ.</p>
            <p>4. By it wee are united to
Christ, and made one with him,
<hi>flesh of his flesh, and bone of his
bone, Ephes.</hi> 5. 30. lively members
of that body whereof hee is
head: and so as we have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
right to his benefits; so wee
draw sap and vertue from him,
to dye to sinne and live to righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse,
without which faith
and union wee bee dead in tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spasses,
and can doe nothing.
An impe not grafted into a
stocke, but lying by, withers,
and never beares fruit, but is
for the fire: so are we without
Christ: and as a woodden legge
receives no sense or motion
from the head; it is but tyed on


<pb n="261" facs="tcp:27910:137"/>
with points, so wee without
faith; and is not this an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
thing that makes man a
member of Christ?</p>
            <p>5. It is the roote of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
graces. Hence comes
peace: for being assured of
Gods love unspeakeable, and
our pardon and salvation, it ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth
feare and terrour, and
peace comes in stead of it, <hi>Rom.</hi>
5. 1. yea and joy, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 2. yea
<hi>Rom. 15. 13. The God of hope fill
you with joy and peace in beleeving,</hi>
yea as <hi>Phil. 4. 7. peace that pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
understanding,</hi> and 1. <hi>Pet. 1.
8. joy that is unspeakeable and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</hi>
That as it is unspeakea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
terrour to bee under our
sinnes and the wrath of God;
so unspeakeable joy to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
unto him: so it breeds
boldnesse in Gods presence,
<hi>Ephes.</hi> 3. 12. and is not this a
goodly matter? yea and that at
the day of judgement, when
the proudest and boldest sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners


<pb n="262" facs="tcp:27910:138"/>
shall with hills to fall on
them, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 6. 16. as in this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
<hi>cap.</hi> 2. 28. yea it will cause
greater boldnesse than was in
<hi>Hester</hi> to <hi>Ahashuerosh.</hi> It will
bring Christ into our armes, so
as wee may say with <hi>Simeon,</hi>
Lord, <hi>now lettest thou thy serva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t
depart in peace, &amp;c.</hi> And as <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph's</hi>
brethren came to him
with confidence when <hi>Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi>
was with them: so wee to
God when wee bring Christ
with us. Hence comes love to
God, as it must needs: the love
of Christ constraines, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.
and 1. <hi>Pet. 1. 8. Whom though yee
see not, yet ye love him:</hi> and hee
shewes the reason, <hi>because yee
beleeve in him.</hi> So <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 47.
the woman that knew that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
sinnes were forgiven her,
shee could not tell how to love
enough: and <hi>David, Psal. 103. 3.
Blesse the Lord, O my soule, who
forgiveth thee all thine iniquitles:</hi>
and <hi>Psal.</hi> 116. 11. also, <hi>What shall


<pb n="263" facs="tcp:27910:138"/>
I give unto the Lord for all his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit:
towards mee?</hi> So also it will
worke in us love to our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
for his cause, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 6.
<hi>faith worketh by love:</hi> which is
ready to shew it selfe upon all
occasions, according to the
measure of our faith; to their
soules, and bodies, forgiving
wrongs, yea forgiving till se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty
times seven times, <hi>Luke</hi>
17. 4. which made the Apostles
to pray for it, <hi>Lord increase our
faith, ver.</hi> 5. It breedes thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse:
and hence also comes
patience, an excellent grace,
when faith tells us that it is of
our mercifull father that we be
afflicted for our good, and that
<hi>hee will lay no more on us than hee
will inable us to beare, 1. Cor.</hi> 10.
13. and that the end shall bee
happy. These things keepe
us from murmuring, and from
using unlawfull meanes, or
sinking under our troubles.

<pb n="264" facs="tcp:27910:139"/>
that being cast into the sea in
the greatest storme and rage,
would calme it presently; but
to bee sure, faith calmes the
heart where stormes and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
have beene greatest.
It is the loadstone that lookes
ever to Christ, as that doth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the North; and as that
drawes iron to it, so doth faith
joyne our hearts to Christ. It is
like the flower of the Suune,
which turnes ever toward
Christ, as that doth towards
the Sunne: yea, what should I
name particulars? for hence
comes all obedience. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 7.
By faith <hi>Noah</hi> obeyed in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the Arke, which was a
difficult thing; so <hi>Abraham</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooke
his country, and offered
his son.</p>
            <p>It purgeth the heart, and
chaseth away the love of all
evill, and brings in the love of
all Gods commandements, and
breedes obedience to any thing


<pb n="265" facs="tcp:27910:139"/>
that God shall require, <hi>Psalm</hi>
119. 8.</p>
            <p>It makes us not onely wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to obey God in doing, but
even in suffering; to count
house, land, wife, children, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
to be nothing for the love
of God, but to sticke to Christ
though we lose all these.</p>
            <p>To confesse with boldnesse
the Name of the Lord Iesus, and
his truth, though with never
such perill.</p>
            <p>It caused the mother to send
away her childe that morning,
to another nurse, when she was
to goe to execution; and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
to stand by, and see her
childe grievously tortured, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
I never held childe better
bestowed, and thanking God
that ever shee bare him: And
to forsake them cheerfully, as
did D. <hi>Taylor</hi> and <hi>Cutbert Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
who seeing his wife and
children in the way as hee was
going to the stake, and feeling


<pb n="266" facs="tcp:27910:140"/>
some yearning of bowells, rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
himselfe, saying, Ah flesh,
wouldest thou hinder mee in
my journey? well, goe to, thou
shalt not prevaile.</p>
            <p>It made the Martyrs endure
torments, and to neglect father,
mother, wife, childe, to follow
Christ. See <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. toward the
end, and <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. toward the
end. It made <hi>Moyses</hi> forsake
<hi>Pharaohs</hi> Court, and to <hi>choose
rather to suffer affliction with the
people of God, than to enjoy the
pleasures of sinne, Heb.</hi> 11. 25. It
made many kisse the stake,
clap hands in the fire, and to
thanke God that they were
worthy to suffer for his name;
saying, that though they had a
sharpe breakfast, yet they
should have a joyfull dinner.</p>
            <p>6. It is that that makes the
Word, Sacraments, and our
prayers profitable to us. The
Word when it is beleeved, and
particularly applyed to our


<pb n="267" facs="tcp:27910:140"/>
selves, then it profiteth us; as
contrarily, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 2. The Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Lords Supper doth
us no good without this; but
only offers shells and outward
signes to our condemnation,
not discerning the Lords body;
so guilty of the Lords body, and
to eate our condemnation, and
so it becomes to us like the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and bitter water. Faith is
the eye, hand, mouth of the
soule, and therefore without
that, the Sacrament cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.
So our prayers made in
faith prevaile much, <hi>Iam.</hi> 5. 16.
but nothing without it. <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 6. 7.</p>
            <p>7. It is a notable meanes to
further us in our journey to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
heaven, to keepe us safe
from the mighty adversary of
our soules and salvation; <hi>A
shield to quench his fiery darts,
Eph. 6. 16. 1 Pet. 5. 8. Your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versarie
the divell as a roaring
Lyon goeth about, whom resist.


<pb n="268" facs="tcp:27910:141"/>
stedfast in the faith.</hi> And this
might be shewed by instancing
in sundry of the temptations of
the divell, which faith quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth,
and like a shield keepes
them from piercing the heart.</p>
            <p>It is the victory that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
the world. 1. the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
ill examples of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
which like a raging
streame beares downe all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it; but they that are groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
fast in the faith are not
moved by them.</p>
            <p>The alluring and sweet baites
of the deceitfull inchanting
world, which are most strong
and dangerous: therefore wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<hi>Heb</hi> 11. 37. it is set downe,
that <hi>they were tempted;</hi> among
other sore temptations, that is
named for one.</p>
            <p>Thus the Martyrs were
tempted after this manner by
the world. Play a wife mans
part, save your selfe: if you will
returne to the Church and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure,


<pb n="269" facs="tcp:27910:141"/>
you shall have this and
that promotion, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>More by the inchantments
of this strumpet have beene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled,
than by the threats:
Faith scornes that any base
transitory profit or pleasure
should draw his heart, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth,
from God, or from a
good conscience, or to sell his
peace and hope of heaven.</p>
            <p>So it overcomes the frownes,
threats, and uttermost wrongs
that it can doe, despising the
crosse, and enduring the shame;
contemning any temporary af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
in respect of the love
of God, and Christ Iesus, or
hazzarding his part in the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
happinesse. Thus the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs
(as <hi>Romanus</hi> among the
rest) overcame their adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and made them weary,
when as they could not tell
what to say. If a man had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
of this, hee might goe
thorough whatsoever. The


<pb n="270" facs="tcp:27910:142"/>
onely conquerour indeed is the
beleever, to whom nothing can
come too difficult, to doe, to
suffer, yea that would pose all
the world to doe. So it fenceth
us against the temptations of
sinne, that arise from our owne
corrupt nature: Shall I doe thus
and thus, and sinne against my
God and mercifull Father? It
draweth vertue from Christ to
mortifie sinne: It challengeth
the promise that saith, <hi>sinne shall
not have dominion over your mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
body that you should obey it is
the lusts thereof, Rom.</hi> 6. 12. It
gives much glory to God, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving
things because hee hath
said them, to reason incredible,
in nature impossible, puts to his
seale that God is true. It gets
upon the head of reason, when
it is at the farthest, and sees
quite beyond it, and claps the
hands, saying, It is so, it is so.</p>
            <p>In Natures schoole wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
first, then beleeve; but in


<pb n="271" facs="tcp:27910:142"/>
Gods, we beleeve first, and then
conceive: conceive what wee
can, and what wee cannot, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
and admire.</p>
            <p>Thus we beleeve the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the world of nothing,
which most Phylosophers gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say,
affirming, that of nothing
nothing can be made.</p>
            <p>So when we be wrapt in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
and compassed about, and
see no way out, yet to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
I shall have a good end; as
<hi>Abraham</hi> for offering his Son:
yet God had said, In <hi>Isaac</hi> shall
thy seed be called. So <hi>Ioshua,</hi> and
the people for the falling of
the walls of Iericho; and <hi>Heb.
I1. 1. It is the substance of things
hoped for, i. e.</hi> gives a beeing (to
us) unto things that as yet
(in themselves) have no bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<hi>and the evidence of things
not seene,</hi> that is, a cleere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
of things that bee
not seene. Thus we beleeve the
resurrection of our bodies, and


<pb n="272" facs="tcp:27910:143"/>
eternall life after this.</p>
            <p>Hereby now we beleeve the
ruine of Rome, though shee
seeme to prevaile, and get the
upper hand.</p>
            <p>Hereby we hang upon God,
when wee see no likely hood or
way of helpe or deliverance;
so as we can say, I will trust in
him, though he kill me, <hi>Iob</hi> 13.
15. and in long delayes, yet faith
holds.</p>
            <p>9. Faith is exceeding profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
through all our course,
and in prosperity many wayes,
but especially it is our odde
friend in adversitie. Another
<hi>Simon</hi> to beare our crosse. Oh it
doth us Knights service; then
it holds us up by the chin, that
we sinke not, as else we must: so
that our head is above water,
though all the body bee under.
<hi>I should have fainted, except I
had beleeved, to see the goodnesse of
the Lord in the land of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
Psal.</hi> 27. 13.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="273" facs="tcp:27910:143"/>
This we may see in <hi>Iacob;</hi> for
what had become of him when
he heard of <hi>Esau's</hi> comming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him with foure hundred
men, but for his faith? It is true
that God had made him a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise;
but he had the comfort of
it, because he beleeved it.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> when he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
so pale, yet finding a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
and beleeving it, hee staid
himselfe upon it, <hi>Neh.</hi> 2. 2.</p>
            <p>So many amongst our selves
in divers afflictions should
sinke, were it not for the faith
of Gods promise; much more
the Martyrs in their intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
sufferings.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour Christ was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
<hi>by my God, my God,</hi> or else
he had been gone.</p>
            <p>10. And in the end of our
life it is even as a chariot to
carry up our soules to heaven,
<hi>Iohn 3. 16. That as many as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
in him shall not perish, but
have everlasting life.</hi> As <hi>Enoch</hi>


               <pb n="274" facs="tcp:27910:144"/>
and <hi>Elias</hi> were translated
(though not bodily as they) yet
our faith translates our soules
up to God, 1. <hi>Pet. 1. 9. receiving
the end of your faith, the salvation
of your soules.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now is not this an excellent
grace that never failes us till it
hath brought us to God, and
makes death, which is the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of the world, to bee a wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
messenger?</p>
            <p>11. Yet further the names
given it in Scripture, and from
the Scripture shew so much: For
it is called <hi>Iustifying Faith, Rom.</hi>
5. 1. because it justifies us, which
other faiths doe not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saving Faith,</hi> as <hi>Ephes. 2, 8. by
Faith yee are saved:</hi> for some
faiths bee not saving.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lively Faith,</hi> in opposition to
the dead faith of hypocrites,
that drawes no life from
Christ, nor shewes forth any
life in godly fruits of good
workes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="275" facs="tcp:27910:144"/>
It is called <hi>Faith of Gods elect,
Tit.</hi> 1. 1. a rare jewell bestowed
on none but Gods deare ones,
such as he ordained to salvation
before the world; not such
faith as reprobates may have.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Precious Faith, 2. Pet.</hi> 1. 1. of
wondrous worth and value: no
copper faith, but more preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
than gold, yea than fine
gold, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 7. Yea, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 31.
10. a vertuous woman is said to
be farre above the pearles, who
is so commended for her faith
which made her vertuous: and
the wisedome so commended
in the proverbs which proceeds
from, and is joyned with true
faith, is not onely better than
silver, and much fine gold, but
whatsoever else it can be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
unto.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Most holy Faith, Iude ver.</hi> 20.
because it is a gift of Gods most
holy Spirit, and brings forth
holy life, which it drawes from
our most holy head Christ-Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="276" facs="tcp:27910:145"/>
12. It gets us a good repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
in the Church of, God,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 2. It sets us on to doe
such workes of piety to God,
and charity to men, as doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
us as good a report, as vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
men had a great name by
their exploits.</p>
            <p>13. It obtaines us many a
temporary blessing and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance:
as to <hi>Asa</hi> and <hi>Iehosaphat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
great victories, by their faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
depending upon God.</p>
            <p>It is not onely profitable to
our selves, but to others also:
<hi>i. e.</hi> to our children. Even a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor
of faith benefits his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
interesting them unto
Baptism and the priviledges of
the Church. But true faith
greatly availes the children of
such parents, both because God
hath made promise to bee the
God of such and also of their
seede, besides their many faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
prayers.</p>
            <p>2. Yea to strangers, both


<pb n="277" facs="tcp:27910:145"/>
for their soules and bodies, <hi>Iam.
5. 14. send for the elders, and the
prayer of faith shall save the sicke,
i. e.</hi> heale him, and restore him
to health;<hi>yea if heo have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
sinnes they shall be forgiven.</hi>
Yea to the very wicked it may
obtaine temporall blessings, as
<hi>Moses</hi> his prayer obtained for
<hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and for the murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Israelites, and <hi>Eliah</hi> for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab</hi>
in procuring raine.</p>
            <p>In all these respects, who can
but say that faith is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
grace? come gaze and look
upon it, that you may admire &amp;
fall in love withall, as men doe
at the goodly house or sumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
palace of some great man,
or Prince, and such things.</p>
            <p>No merchandise to bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
hereto; hee that hath it
hath God for his Father, Christ
his Saviour, the holy Ghost
his Comforter, the Angells to
guard him, creatures on the
earth, the world it selfe, yea all


<pb n="278" facs="tcp:27910:146"/>
things present and to come are
his, and he Christs.</p>
            <p>Compare it with other
things that be excellent, and
see it excelling them: what
shall I compare it with, wealth,
honour, authory, great birth?
base things in comparison, not
worthy to bee named with
things that bee truely excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</p>
            <p>What then? knowledge of
things humane and divine, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
great understanding
in the Scriptures is excellent,
yet the devill hath this, and the
meanest beleever hath a better
gift.</p>
            <p>The gift of prophecy is an
excellent gift, to open the
Scripture, discourse of points of
Religion and Faith, yea, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the same to the peoples use;
a very profitable gift, seeing it
may convert many and build
up more, yet this a reprobate
may have.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="279" facs="tcp:27910:146"/>
The faith of miracles is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
gift, &amp; to cast out devils:
hee that had these would with
<hi>Simon Magus</hi> be thought some
great man, and such gifts were
worthy great reverence, yet
these a reprobate might have,
<hi>Matth. 7. 22. Many will say to me
in that day, Lord, Lord, have wee
not prophesied in thy Name, and
in thy Name have cast out devills?
&amp;c.</hi> Yea, among other true
and saving graces faith obtains
the chiefety, as humility, love,
patience, sobriety, which
though they be excellent gifts,
yet they apprehend not Christ;
they breede not faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but faith
is the mother of them.</p>
            <p>Wee may therefore say of
faith, as <hi>Salomon</hi> of the vertuous
woman, Many daughters have
done vertuously, but thou sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mountest
them all, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31 29.
Her price is above the pearles;
for this is a most precious jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell,
and pearle invaluable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="280" facs="tcp:27910:147"/>
And as infidelity is the most
odious vice, the breeder and
mother of all sinne, and doth
most dishonor God, so is faith
the contrary. Vnbeliefe denies
God the glory of his power, as
if he were not able to fulfill the
promise of his truth, or as if he
were unfaithfull; and makes a
man flee from God, as <hi>Adam,</hi>
and finally, makes Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
into the world of no use.</p>
            <p>Here see and know who bee
the excellent ones in the
world; oh true beleevers, <hi>Psal.</hi>
16. 3. They are called the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent.
<hi>Pro. 12. 26. The righteous
is more excellent than his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi>
that is, who is not righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous:
faith makes a man righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
both by making Christs
righteousnesse ours by imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and secondly by drawing
sanctifying grace from Christ.</p>
            <p>Hee that is not thus righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
by faith, wee say of him as
of <hi>Ruben,</hi> hee is not excellent.


<pb n="281" facs="tcp:27910:147"/>
Whatsoever wealth, honour
thou hast, whosoever thou art,
thou art not excellent; nay
whatsoever knowledge, gifts,
profession thou hast, without
true faith, thou art not excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
but a painted sheath, a gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous
sepulchre: thou hast no
part in Christs death, neither is
thy person or worke pleasing
to God, nor hast thou right to
any good thing.</p>
            <p>But the true beleever is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,
as having attained to a
rare jewell, and an invaluable
pearle: as may appeare if you
looke over the benefits of true
faith before mentioned: yea
though thou be poore and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised
in the world, yet art thou
happy. Be thankfull to God,
and whatsoever paines thou
hast taken to get faith, yet bee
glad, seeing thou hast a rich
penny-worth.</p>
            <p>Wonder that man having
stript himselfe of all his robes


<pb n="282" facs="tcp:27910:148"/>
of his creation, should yet bee
restored to any such glory yet
once againe, and that God
should ever bestow this on
thee which is to so few given.
Vse all meanes to nourish this
as thy jewell, as the Word, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
Prayer, good compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
care to keepe a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science:
in all things walke
worthy of so excellent a gift,
staine it not by any sinne wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
committed.</p>
            <p>And doe thou know that
hast it not, that thou canst ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be excellent, till thou doest
injoy it. But alas what toyling
is there for bafe things, when
the most excellent things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
are left unregarded?</p>
            <p>God open mens eyes, that
they may see and seeke after
the things that are truly excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</p>
            <p>And thus having shewed the
excellencie of faith, I am now
in the next place to speake of


<pb n="283" facs="tcp:27910:148"/>
the difficulty of it,<note place="margin">5. Difficulty of Faith.</note> and then of
the lets and impediments from
whence this difficulty ariseth.
For as Faith is excellent, so (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the nature of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
things) it is not easie but
hard to bee obtained. It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
easie for one to say, hee
hath faith; but to have a true
and lively faith indeed, is a
matter hardly atchieved. So
<hi>Iam. 2. 14. What doth it profit my
brethren, though a man say he hath
faith, &amp;c?</hi> It is easie to say, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
and hope to bee saved by
Iesus Christ, but to beleeve in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
is very hard, that is, to
beleeve upon good ground and
warrant. For Faith is built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Word and promise of
God, or else it is no true faith:
and thus to beleeve upon the
warrant of the Word is not so
easie a thing.</p>
            <p>For this is not only not in
our owne power, but neither
man nor Angell can worke it,


<pb n="284" facs="tcp:27910:149"/>
only it is of the operation of
God.</p>
            <p>Oh, Faith is a thing most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,
as making Christ ours
and us the children of God, and
as being the shield which quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
the fiery darts of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell,
our victory whereby wee
overcome the world, and that
hand which purifieth the
heart in the precious laver of
Christs blood. And therefore
it is another manner of matter,
than for a man to say, I hope to
be saved by Christ; seeing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of these, have no hearts pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
nor lives reformed.</p>
            <p>That is wrought by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery
of the Word, sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by God for that end; but to

            <p>Againe, the way to heaven
is straight, and few finde it; and


<pb n="285" facs="tcp:27910:149"/>
this faith is the way to heaven.
Few attaine to Faith, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 1.
<hi>Who hath beleeveth our report?</hi>
and, When the Sonne of Man
commeth, shall hee finde faith
upon the earth? <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. 8.</p>
            <p>It is indeed easie to presume;
for that is of the flesh, &amp; the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell
helpes it forward: but hard
to beleeve.</p>
            <p>To make this plaine to every
man: you shall see that every
step to faith is hard. Goe over
the way that God brings one to
faith, even the worke that the
Law must doe is hard. For
knowledge, first, even that is
hard, in respect of our blinde
and dull understanding; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
our carelesnesse, in not
giving our minde to get it, but
have so many other things in
our head; therefore few get any
competency of knowledge, but
are grosly ignorant.</p>
            <p>Much more is the particular
knowledge of every mans own


<pb n="286" facs="tcp:27910:150"/>
sinnes, wretchednesse, corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
easie? Oh no, there is too
much selfe-love in us for this,
the proud heart of man cannot
listen to it.</p>
            <p>Then for a man to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
in conscience, that he is
the man that is so miserable and
undone, to confesse it true of
himselfe without any longer
posting it off to others.</p>
            <p>Next, to be stricken with ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
upon this sight of our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery;
Oh this is rare and hard
to come to. Oh no, people can
heare the Law, and their mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and the judgements of God
denounced against their sinnes,
and yet not blanke at all. No,
they have armour of proofe to
beare off that; hearts harder
than flint, as impenitrable as a
wall of brasse; oh no, their stout
stomacke will not come downe.
Nay, though God adde crosses,
yet it stirreth us up to rage, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience,
rebellion, rather than


<pb n="287" facs="tcp:27910:150"/>
casts us downe. The Law alone,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oh it is but words, thunder
without lightning, and when
deeds come too, yet never the
neerer most what.</p>
            <p>Ministers feare to preach the
Law for terrifying men, and
driving them to despaire, but
they need not in respect of that
great security that raigneth in
them. And yet if a man were
come to this, were it not a great
peece of worke? a <hi>Iudas,</hi> a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell
goes as farre, yet these
thinke they goe farre enough.
And if they bee thus terrified,
yet how few never goe further,

Then come to the Gospells
working. Is it easie for a man
pressed under the terrours of
the Law to be so much as kept
from sinking, or taking any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
bad course, by hearing ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,
that there is a helpe and
remedy for sinners, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it bee for him or no, he is
uncertaine?</p>
            <p>Then againe for contrition:
Is it a small thing to breake the
heart of a man for, or from his
sinne? Oh it is an invincible
peece of worke; a man will
part with goods, children of his
body, or any thing rather than
from his lusts, or be brought to
a deepe dislike of his courses,
and vexation with himselfe for
them, to cleere the Lord, and
condemne himselfe, to become
teachable and gentle, a schollar
willing to be ruled by God i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
whatsoever course he shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
him.</p>
            <p>And then for him still to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend


<pb n="289" facs="tcp:27910:151"/>
on the ministery of the
Word, that hee may see what
God will doe for him in time;
Is this easie? And as he is scarce
able to advise himselfe, so the
divell makes him beleeve if he
should tell others, hee should
discredit himselfe.</p>
            <p>Then when this poore man
is wrestling and winding out of
his bands, faine hee would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to confesse his sinne, and
cry to God for pardon (as hee
seeth need enough) and incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
from God, so to doe,
and thus to unload himselfe: but
then the divell blindes his eyes,
hardens his heart, and stops his
mouth that he cannot utter his
complaint to God as hee desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
in any sort; but when hee
would, the divell brings confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
into his soule, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell almost how to goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it. Indeed he doth it, but
so awkely and coldly, as hee is
vexed with himselfe; and


<pb n="290" facs="tcp:27910:152"/>
thinkes, If I could mourne, and
powre out my heart to God, I
would not doubt of mercy;
but I am lockt up, I cannot doe
it. And at this passe the devill
holds many a poore soule a
good while without comfort:
and though God doth accept
the will for the deede, yet hee
himselfe is not so satisfied.</p>
            <p>Then when hee findes that
God meanes as verily to shew
him mercy, as hee feeles him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to stand in neede of it, yet
doe you thinke it is easie for
him to come to a thirsty soule
after it? True, hee seeth cause
enough to thirst, finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
quite empty, and seeth
that if hee have not mercy hee
must perish. It doth his heart
good to heare of the promise,
which is made to the thirsty,
because they shall be filled, and
they onely. But now he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
finde such a thirst as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
but a fulnesse; he knowes


<pb n="291" facs="tcp:27910:152"/>
if he could thirst he should bee
satisfied, but hee cannot finde
it: Oh, saith he, thirst requireth
sense, yea it is the sharpest sense
and desire; which I cannot
finde. Now though God wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
accept his desire, and give him
both thirst and water of life too
in time, yet in the meane while
he is without it.</p>
            <p>Then come to the last point
before beleeving: Is it easie to
come to sell all, to deny our
selves, and take up our crosse
daily that wee may follow
Christ? oh these beloved sinnes
that he hath committed spiritu
all fornication so long &amp; so oft
with, now to part with them
all for ever, is a matter of great
difficulty. Is is true, for any
good there is in them hee
might, but to our nature this is
a hard worke.</p>
            <p>Then when hee comes to
buy the pearle, to goe through
and strike up the bargaine, to


<pb n="292" facs="tcp:27910:153"/>
apprehend the promise, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
it to himselfe; doth not
many a one stand straining
courtesie, and is full of feare,
as thinking that it is not true
to him, or that it is too good a
bargaine, seeing others carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the pearle, but he holds it
in his hand, but dares not put it
up as his owne? so that if God
should not hearten and streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
him, he would goe neere
to lose it now when hee is
come to the upshot. Well, at
last hee fastens on it. But when
hee hath done so, can hee
hold it fast this weeke and
next moneth? in a while is hee
not in his dumpts, doubting
again and full of feares?</p>
            <p>Well, when he hath attained
faith to beleeve the maine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
even of pardon and salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
yet there bee many other
subordinate promises, as of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance,
of sufficient grace to
carry him through all difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties


<pb n="293" facs="tcp:27910:153"/>
and temptations, and is it
easie to beleeve these? hath not
the poore childe of God some
toile with this, when hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves
his salvation, and yet
sometimes feares he shall never
hold out to the end? especially
if long or sore paines, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution,
and the fire should
come, notwithstanding that
God hath promised as wel these
as pardon and salvation.</p>
            <p>And some inferiour promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
also of outward things are
hardly beleeved: as, not failing
of any needfull thing, that God
will lay no more upon us than
he will make us able to beare. Is
it easie to beleeve these? and
are not even beleevers often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
at their wits ends, and
ready to faint in temptation of
poverty, danger, and such like?
I speake not of living by faith,
and having this at all turnes
through our course, which is a
high point, (and of which it


<pb n="294" facs="tcp:27910:154"/>
may be I shall say somewhat ere
I part with this point of faith)
but even to beleeve things, and
that wee shall bee in all estates
upheld by God, at the first espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
is a hard thing.</p>
            <p>Then by this I hope you all
see, that faith is no easie matter;
for if every steppe to it be diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult,
then the whole is not easie.
Oh no, som cannot beleeve, <hi>Ioh.</hi>
5. 44. some will not beleeve,
<hi>cap.</hi> 5. 40. but few do beleeve to
be sure, as appeares too plainly.</p>
            <p>If so,<note place="margin">T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ng</hi> Gods ministers.</note> then for us Ministers;
our duety is to travell much in
this point, and to bring people
to it, and to think that it is not
enough to glance at it, or now
and then to speak somewhat of
it, but wee must dwell upon it,
and think it as wel-spent time,
and that it is as needefull a
part of our labor as any other,
and none like it, as without
which indeed all is nothing, &amp;
that withall it is very hard.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="295" facs="tcp:27910:154"/>
And that we thinke not that
every one that can say the
Creed, ten Commandements,
and Lords Prayer, and can say
he is a sinner, and can speake of
Christ, is straight a beleever,
and fit to come to the Lords
Supper; or some that bee faire
conditioned and better than
most others, or then they have
been, straight that they bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers,
when as any of any true
insight can see no likelihood
of faith in them. It is good
to hope the best, and to give
encouragement to smal things;
but we must tell them, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
is yet wanting to make
them true beleevers, else this
makes people careless. O lament
the carnall security of men
in these daies, who make wide
doors to bring them to heaven.</p>
            <p>This also confutes that er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous
and blinde conceit of
the vulgar sort,<note place="margin">The use re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>specting the people.</note> that it is an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
thing to beleeve, as appeares


<pb n="296" facs="tcp:27910:155"/>
too plainly by their words and
courses. For first for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
they thanke God they
bee fully perswaded they shall
bee saved, and have no doubt
of it: But how came you by it?
Nay that they cannot tell. But
this is suspicious to have goods
in our house, and not to know
how wee came by them. They
that have true faith, know how
they came by it ere they had it.
How long have you had this
perswasion? Ever. That is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to prove it nought; for
faith is not bred with us, and
he that is a beleever can remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the time hee was no belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
And what paines have
you taken for it, what hath it
cost you? they can say nothing
to that: It is therefore too
cheape to bee good, and of the
right stampe.</p>
            <p>I thought you that said it
was so easie were furthest off
from it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="297" facs="tcp:27910:155"/>
To presume is easie indeed,
but not to beleeve: aske the
belever, he thinkes it the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
thing in the world, hee
could better doe this and that,
than hee can beleeve. No, no,
though they that never knew
what the burden of sin meant,
and so not the worth of Gods
mercy, make a sleight matter of
beleeving, and can doe it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any doubting, yet they that
have had their eyes opened,
and hearts humbled, cannot so
easily shake it off, it is too great
a matter.</p>
            <p>Also for others, they shew
that they thinke it easie, and
they wonder at them that bee
troubled, and have doubts: and
comming to any such in sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
they rate them, and bid
them, Beleeve foole; canst not
beleeve? thou art a foole indeed.
But yet the servants of God
that goe about it in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>de it a hard peece of


<pb n="298" facs="tcp:27910:156"/>
worke; and indeed how long
is it ere many can fasten on it?
Therefore let those that came
by it at ease suspect themselves:
though some childe comes into
the world with lesse paine to
the mother than others, yet
none without some.</p>
            <p>Also hereby it appeares they
thinke it easie, because many
put it off till the last, and thinke
to have it at their command.
No friend, the time of sicknesse
and the death-bed, is a time to
use and spend faith in, not to
get it; neither thinke thou to
get it then that hast it not
now.</p>
            <p>3. But as for thee who hast
attained grace to beleeve, doe
thou thanke God highly that
hath brought thee thorow such
a difficult peece of worke: thy
father and thy mother, all the
Ministers in the Countrie, and
all the Angells in heaven could
not have done it for thee, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore


<pb n="299" facs="tcp:27910:156"/>
be thankfull.</p>
            <p>Thou hast beene brought
thorow many difficulties, thou
hast sayled by many a sand
where others have sunk them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and betweene many a
rocke where others have split
themselves and beene cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
as betweene senslesse
blockishnesse and despaire; and
when thou camest to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite,
remember that it went
not over too soone, till it had
made thee thirst and sell all.
And many miscarry at these
plots.</p>
            <p>And know, as it was difficult
to get faith (and thanke God
for it) so now whatsoever
paines thou takest for it, thou
wilt not part with it againe for
any thing: Wilt? No.</p>
            <p>So know also, that thou shalt
finde difficultie to keepe and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ourish it.</p>
            <p>4. Let none count of it as a

and at their pleasure, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
put it off till death, or seeke
it lazily: but, as for a matter of
great difficulty, lay for it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times.
If a malefactor lay not
for a pardon till hee be on the
ladder, hee may be hanged ere
that come; so many are dead
ere they get faith, they went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it so late and so lazily:
then they would have oyle, but
while they are seeking it, the
Bridegroome comes, and they
are shut out, as it is with many
that know they must have faith,
and have gone about it, but too
late.</p>
            <p>Let us then be content to take
paines about it, and that in
time, and though we obtaine it
not by and by, yet follow it,
&amp; think no pains too great for
it; be not content to take only
one step, and so thinke to have
faith by and by, but let us wait
our time for it, one thing after
mother, as others have done.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="301" facs="tcp:27910:157"/>
The next point after the dif<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ficulty
of faith,<note place="margin">Rarenesse of Faith, and few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers.</note> is to speake of
the fewnesse of beleevers, and
then as a reason of it, come to
the lets. Not onely as <hi>Paul</hi>
saith, all men have not faith, but
few ever have had, or have
it. When the old world was
drowned, &amp; only <hi>Noah</hi> &amp; his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
preserved, how few were
the number of true beleevers?
When the Church was in a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
as of <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi>
there were <hi>Ismaels</hi> and <hi>Esau's.</hi> In
the Prophets dayes, how few?
<hi>Esa.</hi> 53. 1. When our Saviour
Christ came, how few beleeved
on earth? hee came among his
owne, and his owne received
him not, and both Iewes and
Gentiles conspire to put him to
death.</p>
            <p>And even amongst us, take
ignorant, prophane, civill
worldlings, and hypocrites out
of townes, and how many will
be left.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="302" facs="tcp:27910:158"/>
At this houre there is little
faith, most have no meanes of
faith, most of those that live
under the meanes get no faith:
there were three bad grounds
and but one good. Few finde
the narrow way. There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
called, few chosen; so when
Christ <hi>shall come, shall hee finde
faith upon earth? Luk.</hi> 18 8</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> But how can wee tell
that there be few Beleevers?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The grosse ignorance
so common in most parts of the
Land, doth plainely shew it;
for without knowledge no
faith, seeing it is the first thing
in faith.</p>
            <p>2. So much wickednesse of life
against the first &amp; second table,
as wee should soone see, if wee
should go over the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
&amp; most be tainted with
foule sinnes: they that bee not,
yet live in some sinnes (as civill
persons and hypocrites) though
not so grosse: as unfaithfulnesse:


<pb n="303" facs="tcp:27910:158"/>
And the hatred of the children
of God, which being so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
prove certainely that
there is no faith; for faith pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifieth
the heart, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 3. faith is not idle not
barren, but fruitfull, casting out
all knowne sin, and loving the
contrary.</p>
            <p>And therefore let every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
looke about them,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> and feare
themselves, except they can
prove it well.</p>
            <p>Now the cause why so few
attaine to faith, is because there
are many lets and impediments
which hinder them from it.
But of these I will speake here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
when I come to handle
the ninth point (which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded)
in its due place.</p>
            <p>But howsoever it bee a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of great difficulty to attaine
unto a lively faith, yet wee are
to know that it is most necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for all that will be saved; and
therefore in the sixth place I


<pb n="304" facs="tcp:27910:159"/>
will shew the necessity of it.
And first, it is so necessary, that
without it we can have no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
in this life, nor salvation

nor of glory in heaven, <hi>Ioh 3 16.
Mark. 16. 16. Act.</hi> 16. 31.</p>
            <p>Wee can have no right to
Christs death, but remaine in
our owne filthinesse. It is faith
onely that makes Christ ours
by Gods appointment; no right
to his obedience, but lie under
our sinnes and guilt, lyable to
the curse of God, and to beare
our owne burden.</p>
            <p>Without faith it is impossible
to please God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6. seeing
there can bee no person nor
worke pleasing till wee have
true faith. Wee can have no
spirituall life without it, but we
remaine starke dead in our sins,
not able to move a finger in any
good action nor to think a good
thought: <hi>for without me you can
doe nothing. Iohn</hi> 15. 5. neyther


<pb n="305" facs="tcp:27910:159"/>
can we draw any vertue or spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
life, but from Christ by
faith; and by it wee being knit
to so loving a head, and the
fountaine of life, wee are made
alive to God, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 1.</p>
            <p>We can have no peace, much
lesse joy without it. There may
indeed bee a false peace, and
men are ready to cry peace,
peace, but it will end in warre:
men (eyther never feeling the
burden of sinne, or imagining
themselves in a good case when
they bee farre from it) may
have, as many have, a false de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull
peace, but no sound one.
Its but a mad laughter and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
joy.</p>
            <p>There is without it no bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in the presence of God, to
call him father, or to aske any
thing of him, much lesse bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to commend our selves
to him in death, or boldnesse at
the day of judgement.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour Christ said, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,


<pb n="306" facs="tcp:27910:160"/>
into thy hands I commend my
spirit, Luke 23. 46. <hi>And so</hi> David,
Psal. 31. 5. Lord, into thy hands I
commend my spirit: for thou hast
redeemed me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No love to God, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 47.
the woman loved much, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
shee beleeved that many
sinnes were forgiven her, <hi>nor
that we loved him, but he loved us
first, 1. Ioh.</hi> 4 19. nor to our bre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thren;
for then wee love them
in Christ, when wee beleeve
that wee are children of the
same Father.</p>
            <p>No zeale for God, or obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in doing or suffering; wee
cannot mortifie our earthly
members, and crucifie our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
sinnes: oh no, till wee be
assured that God hath done
great things for our soule. So to
take up the painefull course of
godlinesse. Much lesse can wee
suffer for Christs sake, before
by faith wee beleeve that hee
suffered so much for us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="307" facs="tcp:27910:160"/>
Without faith wee can have
no right to a bitte of bread; no
means to resist the world or the
devill, for it is the shield of
faith that quencheth all his fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
darts, <hi>Eph. 6. 16. 1. Ioh.</hi> 5. 4. it is
the victory that overcomes
the world; and it overcomes
also the flesh and our corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
drawing vertue from
Christs death. No meanes
without it to make us patient,
much lesse joyfull in trouble, as
we are bidden, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 35. 36.</p>
            <p>No comfort in our life; for
what sound comfort but from
hence? <hi>Psa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</hi> 4. 6. 7. so no joy in
death; for if wee know wee
shall perish, or are in doubt
whither we shall goe, wee can
have no joy but horrour and
terrour.</p>
            <p>Wee can have without it no
salvation after this life: for hee
that beleeves not, is condemned
already, <hi>Ioh. 3. 18. Mark. 16. 16.
He that beleeves not shall be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;</hi>


               <pb n="308" facs="tcp:27910:161"/>
God hath sanctified no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way to heaven.</p>
            <p>It is the wedding garment,
which whosoever wanteth, can
never sit downe with <hi>Abraham,
Isaack,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of heaven, but shall bee
bound hand and foot, and cast
into utter darknesse, whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
else he hath, <hi>Math.</hi> 22. 13.</p>
            <p>It is the oyle in our Lampes
which wee must have, or else
wee shall never enter with the
Bridegroome, but shall be shut
out, though we cry, Lord open
unto us.</p>
            <p>It hath ever beene necessary;
for even by this have all beene
saved from the beginning. By
it our Elders were well repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 3.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> Indeed many are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
for faith, but it is faith
in some particular promise, as,
<hi>Noah,</hi> That hee and his should
be preserved in the floud; and
<hi>Abraham,</hi> That he should have


<pb n="309" facs="tcp:27910:161"/>
a sonne, &amp;c. but not for justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Wee must know they
had faith in the Messiah to
come, who was revealed
though dimly, and from that
promise they also beleeved o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
particular promises made
by God, but from that as from
the originall and fundamentall
promise of all the rest.</p>
            <p>So Christ saith, <hi>Abraham
saw my daye, and rejoyced, Ioh.</hi> 8.
56. so 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 3. the Israelites
did eate <hi>the same spirituall meate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is necessary to all kindes
of persons, rich, poore, and
both one way; old, yongue,
that bee of any discretion, they
must have faith or else no sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>The poore cannot be excused
by their poverty or want of
learning, nor the rich dispensed
with; but all must have faith.</p>
            <p>Every one must have a faith
of his own; for every man must


<pb n="310" facs="tcp:27910:162"/>
be saved by his owne faith: not
the childe by the parents, hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
by their wives, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise,
though they had the
greatest beleever in the world
to their father or husband. It is
true that the parents faith bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
the childe, but to apply
Christ to him it can no more
doe, than my eating can fat or
feed another, or anothers wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of cloathes can warme
mee.</p>
            <p>It is not a thing needfull, and
very needfull; yet so as we may
make ashift without it, and bee
saved, but not doe so well: but
of absolute necessity, seeing
there can bee no well-beeing
without it. As a key is a thing
very needfull to open a doore
that is lockt, yet not so necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
but that some other shift
may be made: as you may picke
the locke, it may be, or breake
the doore open. But not so
here, where there is no other


<pb n="311" facs="tcp:27910:162"/>
means, for this is the onely key,
no picking the locke, no brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
open the doore; none can
come to heaven by stealth or
violence, whether God will or
no. And all that come there by
his knowledge, and will, must
come by faith.</p>
            <p>Then what a miserable case
are all they in; that have not the
meanes to know Christ,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> and
therefore cannot possibly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
in him? oh lamentable
state of huge Nations and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in this case!</p>
            <p>The workes of God are won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull;
severity towards them,
toward us bountifulnesse. How
should wee pitty and pray for
them, and wonder at Gods
mercy to us, and our portion!
Was not Goshen a happy place
over Aegypt was? so wee to
them: And <hi>Amos 4. 7. God cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
it to raine in one Citie, and not
another, and that it rained not on,
withered.</hi> Thus it is with us: And


<pb n="312" facs="tcp:27910:163"/>
oh thrice happy they that
know the day of their visitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it serveth to teach
us Ministers to bee very much
and carefull in handling this
most necessary point of faith;
and in teaching the things
most fit to worke faith: As the
doctrine of the Law to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
men, then of Christ, and of
Faith; what it is, the necessity
of it, and how it is wrought,
and how we may know it.</p>
            <p>And not content our selves
to teach this duty and that, and
to inveigh against this and that
sinne. For we have done the
people no good till they be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers.</p>
            <p>To what purpose is it to
urge the people without faith
to doe this, and forbeare that?
as if one should bid a lame
man or one with great bolts on
his legs to run for a wager, or
a sicke man to goe to his work


<pb n="313" facs="tcp:27910:163"/>
or meate. Till a man be made
alive by faith, and have a state
in grace, it is but lost labour.
And yee see that the most a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
nothing by preaching,
because the doctrine of faith is
no more insisted on.</p>
            <p>If one should fall to mend,
and to leave this sinne, and doe
that duety, what were this, not
comming from faith, and not
being universall? they are but
workes of an hypocrite, and of
a restrained man, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
gifts of the Spirit. And
what if wee could restraine all
our Parish? one converted
man and beleever were better
than they all: for this will on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ase his torments, and bee
somewhat better for others
that live with him, but save him
it will never.</p>
            <p>This is to build without a
foundation, and to put a peece
of new cloath into an old gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and new wine into old


<pb n="314" facs="tcp:27910:164"/>
vessels. <hi>Paul</hi> in all his Epistles
first dwells on the things that
serve to bring to faith, and in
the latter part of them comes
to particular dueties, &amp;c. and
so ought we also to doe.</p>
            <p>This makes the people also
trust to their doings, so that
if they reforme somewhat at
preaching they thinke they be
in a happy case, because so few
do thus much; but for want of
knowing this, that <hi>without faith
it is impossible to please God</hi> in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing wee doe, they deceive
themselves.</p>
            <p>As Popery doth foolishly,
that calls for a good life, &amp; the
meane time overthroweth the
foundation of it, a true faith: so
when wee stand beating upon
this and that point, and do not
care how seldome we urge the
point of faith, alas, what do we?
It is great pity of the losse of so
many good exhortations for
want of a foundation. True it


<pb n="315" facs="tcp:27910:164"/>
is that all such points in a mixt
congregation must bee taught,
yet so, as still wee oft be harping
about the things that should
worke faith, and especially in
such places where most are
without faith quite.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it may serve for
comfort to all that know truly
they have faith. Oh let them
thinke what they should have
done without it; they had bin
miserable creatures: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that they study how to bee
thankfull to God that hath
wrought it; that they nourish
it daily, that it may increase,
walke worthy of such mercy,
and shew forth the fruits of it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, it is for reproofe
of most people, that regard any
thing else but this, which is
not at all, or but little regarded;
tith mint and annise, and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe
weighty matters, cum
ber themselves about many
things, but chuse not the good


<pb n="316" facs="tcp:27910:165"/>
part, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 42. At last every
body would be assured, and on
their death bedde they send for
the Minister: such a Christian
would borrow oyle of others,
but they have but for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs;
&amp; therfore many are shut
out, though they cry, Lord,
Lord, &amp;c. If it bee good in
death, it is to be sought for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in time; many seek know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and gifts, but few seeke
and make sure of a true faith:
yea many regard not this point
of faith at all.</p>
            <p>Others couzen themselves
with every counterfeit; they
hope well, &amp;c. People either
beleeve not what we say of the
necessity of faith, or else con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
they have it when it is
nothing so. If they beleeve it
not, let them confute us; if
they cannot, why then do they
not labour after it?</p>
            <p>Oh that I had grace enough
to lament and weep abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;


<pb n="317" facs="tcp:27910:165"/>
oh that my head were a
fountaine of teares, that I
might powre them out abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
for the misery of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
whom God hath made
happy in respect of time and
meanes, but they unhappily
neglect that that should make
them happy here, and hereafter
for ever.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, it serveth for instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to them that have it not;
Oh let all both high and low
looke to this, and bee ashamed
you have spent your time so
badly as to bee without that,
which if you dye without you
must needs perish.</p>
            <p>Let not the poore finde ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses
by their poverry or want
of learning.</p>
            <p>And you aged, looke you
about you, seeing you have
one foote in the grave; if the
other goe in too, woe be to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of you.</p>
            <p>You yongue ones that be of


<pb n="318" facs="tcp:27910:166"/>
any understanding, know you
also that your life is uncertain,
and that if you dye without
faith, you are undone.</p>
            <p>And you parents, traine up
your children religiously in the
understanding of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Religion, and urge
things upon them, that by your
meanes and Gods blessing on
the publicke Ministery, faith
being wrought in them, you
may have much comfort of
them, if they bee taken away
in their yonguer yeeres.</p>
            <p>And you husbands, long and
labour to see faith in your
wives, and wives in your hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,
and be not content that
they live a peaceable life, and
that you want nothing; and
therefore you will not disquiet
your wives and husbands a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
such things, seeing so you
might fare the worse.</p>
            <p>Oh beware of such carnall
thoughts, and labour each with


<pb n="319" facs="tcp:27910:166"/>
other that you may be brought
to faith. And know, that true
beleevers cannot bee content
that their husbands, or chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
be only civill.</p>
            <p>The seventh point which I
propounded to handle,<note place="margin">Perpetuitie of true Faith.</note> and last
property of Faith, is the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity
of it. And therefore in
the next place I am to shew,
that true justifying faith is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall,
and that wheresoever
it is, it can never bee lost, over
come, nor taken away, nor
wholly faile, but abideth to the
end.</p>
            <p>It is true that a temporarie
faith may bee lost, such as wee
reade of some, <hi>Luke 8. 13. that
beleeved for a season:</hi> as the seed
in the stony ground soone
springs up, but after withereth.
And such likewise as build on
the sand, which soone faile, and
fail when the winde bloweth,
and the storme ariseth: but he
that buildeth on the Rock, the


<pb n="320" facs="tcp:27910:167"/>
flouds and windes cannot
move him.</p>
            <p>Temporary faith is so called
because it lasts not; but this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth
there is a faith that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth,
which is that immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
seed that never dyeth.</p>
            <p>Yet wee must know, that the
reason of our never losing our
faith, is not for any strength in
our selves, but from the might
of God, else we might lose our
salvation every day: but it is not
in our owne keeping, as <hi>Adams,</hi>
but in Gods, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5. &amp; 2 <hi>Cor.
1. 21. It is God that stablisheth us
with you in Christ:</hi> and therefore
though wee bee weake in our
selves, yet we are able to doe all
things through Christ Iesus
which strengtheneth us. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.
13.</p>
            <p>When we apprehend Christ
by faith, wee doe not so much
apprehend him, as hee doth
comprehend us; and therefore
if wee could let him goe, yet


<pb n="321" facs="tcp:27910:167"/>
hee will not let us goe, nay hee
will not let us let him goe: as
<hi>Ieremiah 31. 34. &amp;</hi> 32. 40.</p>
            <p>As wee are knit on our parts
to Christ by faith, so on Gods
part by his Spirit, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
and unchangeable, and
holds us to him for ever.</p>
            <p>Now this may be proved first
by many testimonies of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 1. 3. The faithfull are
compared to a Tree planted by
the River, and <hi>Ieremiah</hi> 17. 8.
the same are planted into a
head so full of sappe and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
life as can never fade,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 15. 5. with 2 <hi>Peter 1. 10.
Psal. 112. 1. Psal.</hi> 125. 1. 2.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Iohn 3. 16. Iohn</hi> the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist
telleth us, that he <hi>who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth</hi>
on the Sonne hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
passed from death to life.
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1. There is no condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to them that are in
Christ: and therefore hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
lose his faith; for if hee
could, then he might perish.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="322" facs="tcp:27910:168"/>
So <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 35. our Saviour gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
a reason of that, <hi>Iohn</hi> 7.
38. such a one that hath rivers
flowing out of him cannot
thirst, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this may bee also
proved by strong reasons. For
first, the election of God, which
is unchangeable, and the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of God stands firme, as
is implyed by that speach of
our Saviour, <hi>Math.</hi> 24. 23.
where he saith, that the false
christs would <hi>if it were possible
deceive the very Elect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But every beleever is Elect
of God, as appeareth, in that
Faith is called the faith of
Gods Elect, and <hi>Act.</hi> 13 48. e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
is made the cause of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the will of God,
which is unresistable, and who
made the world, by his will;
and doth whatsoever hee will
both in heaven and earth, hee
wills it, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 39 40.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="323" facs="tcp:27910:168"/>
Thirdly, the love of God is
unchangeable; for whom he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth,
to the end hee loveth
them. <hi>Iohn 13. 1. Ier. 31. 3. I have
loved thee with an everlasting
love: therefore vvith loving
kindnesse have I drawne thee.</hi>
And his gifts and calling are
without repentance. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.
29. that is to say, his saving
gifts: for common gifts may be
lost; and some saving gifts in
some degree and for a time, as
peace, joy, gifts of grace, but
the essentiall gifts to salvation,
<hi>vid.</hi> Faith and Sanctification,
these be never taken away, only
they may be abated, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
may be lost, at least in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of their acts and operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but not the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the union of the
Beleevers with Christ, is so
true and reall an union, as that
it is also indissoluble, we being
flesh of his flesh, and bone of


<pb n="324" facs="tcp:27910:169"/>
his bones, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 5. 30. what Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
will suffer his limbes and
members to bee pulled away?
and how much lesse will Christ
suffer any to pull a member
from him, and so to leave him
a maimed and imperfect bndy?</p>
            <p>Fiftly, it may bee proved by
Christs promise and intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
(who is ever heard) both
for <hi>Peter, Luk.</hi> 22. 32. and <hi>Iohn</hi>
17. and now his intercession in
heaven for all his Saints.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> But wee may have so
many enemies, and meanes to
pluck our faith from us; as also
so great troubles may come in
rushing upon us, as may deprive
us of our faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Well, <hi>the Lord knoweth
to deliver his out of temptation,
2 Pet.</hi> 2. 9. yea and not <hi>to lay
more on his than hee inableth them
to beare:</hi> and hee <hi>will also give an

the Apostle <hi>Iohn</hi> speaketh, 1. <hi>Ioh.
2. 19. They went out from us, but

32. and therefore it failed not,
seeing hee was heard in all

covered for a time and lay hid,
and the working thereof was
interrupted: but though they

were in a swoone, yet they
came to themselves againe.</p>
            <p>Indeede, <hi>Psal. 51. vers. 10.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> This is meant not of
the particular elect of God, but
of the whole Church, and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of the people; for his elect
cannot finally fall. Secondly,
by such admonitions and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veats,
he putteth a bar against
it that they may not fall.</p>

               <pb n="328" facs="tcp:27910:171"/>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Such speeches are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to awaken hypocrites, and
to make beginners looke to
their foundation; or if they be
directed to good Christians,
then we are thus to understand
it, that God who hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
they should not fall, hath
appointed to keepe them from
falling by these admonitions
and dehortations. Otherwise
also they may be intended not
to make us feare our falling
quite away, but so farre as wee
may fall, or to doe any thing
unworthy of our hope; and to
walke in feare, that we doe not
remit any thing nor flacken our
pace in the waies of godlinesses
yet true faith may bee hindered
for a time and hidden, and a
man may lose the sense of it,
and the actions and workings
thereof may be hindered, but
the habite cannot quite bee
lost.</p>
            <p>Even as fire may bee so cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red


<pb n="329" facs="tcp:27910:171"/>
with ashes, as no heat, nor
light can bee seene or felt, yet
when the ashes bee uncovered
and more wood laid to, and
blowed upon, it will flame out
againe, and shew it selfe both
in light and heate. So, as the
Sunne out of a thicke cloud a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
breaketh out &amp; shineth; or
as a man in a deepe swoune see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
dead, but let him alone,
or use meanes, and by and by he
comes againe to himselfe: and
when hee was at worst, one
might perceive a little breath
and pulse, &amp;c. So in this swoune
of a Christian, we shall perceive
complainings and mislikings of
himselfe.</p>
            <p>As the trees in winter
blowne with strong windes,
which yet indeede make them
roote the faster, and by frosts
and blasts are nipt, which yet
hurt not the trees, but kill the
cankers and hurtfull wormes:

               <pb n="331" facs="tcp:27910:172"/>
Thirdly, what an exceeding
encouragement and provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is this unto all to make
them labour to get this faith,
which is of that unspeakeable
worth? and being gotten, can
never be lost more. What end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
toyle doe men take for
that which they are uncertaine,
whether ever they shall obtaine
it; or if they doe, they know not
how soone they shall lose it?
It would kill ones heart to
toyle for it, and when we have
it, may straight lose it. But it is
not so of faith, which being
once gotten can never be lost.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, it also teacheth us
what to thinke of the finall fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings

            <p>But lest upon this doctrine,<note place="margin">How farre a beleever may fall.</note>
any should sucke poyson, and
waxe proud and carelesse, I
will tell you of some fearefull
things, that may make every


<pb n="332" facs="tcp:27910:173"/>
Christians heart to tremble
within him. Besides that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay
that I have spoken of in the
end of the point of strong
faith, a Beleever may suffer a
most grievous revolt, and fall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
farre, as may make all that
heare of it, much more that see
it, to quake.</p>
            <p>A true beleever may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
waxe proud (and that usually
is the roote of Apostacies and
cause of downefalls) he may I
say waxe proud in himselfe, in
his knowledge, gifts, and his
owne strength, as <hi>Peter</hi> did, as
having had some experience of
the power of the grace of God
in him; hee may thence come
to a carelesse and overly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of holy duties, and
use of the meanes, thence to a
neglect of the meanes, thence
to a giving way carelesly to his
inward corruptions, without
repentance of them afterward
for a time, hence he may easily


<pb n="333" facs="tcp:27910:173"/>
drop into some foule sinne, as
<hi>David,</hi> and from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
or into a course of base
living, which by the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of it makes it odious to
wit, to be a companion of base
persons, a bibber with those,
with whom somtimes he would
have beene loath to have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
with in any familiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
a gamester at home and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
spend away his time
basely abroad, and in wrangling
and contention at home, and
become a most ill example in
the family, though somtimes he
were so zealous, as that hee
toll'd on others to goodnesse,
even the worst plow-boy hee
kept; hee may come to a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
neglect of the ministery
of the Word, Sabbath, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
times and places of Gods
worship, shunning all good
company as much as possible
can be. In this hee may conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
long with a senslesse and
hard heart.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="334" facs="tcp:27910:174"/>
Hee may by the occasion of
this, come to lose all his sense
and feeling of his peace with
God, and in his owne consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
boldnesse with God, all
his credit with the Church,
and become a dead logge to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing that is good. Yea, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
when God shall awaken
his conscience, he may come to
horrour and feare, and a woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
soule, not only not feeling
any faith, but even feeling God
a revengi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>g Iudge, ready to cut
him off, and give him his porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with hypocrites: hee may
further (as it usually falls out)
have some heavy crosse fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, under which hee may
lye in a fearefull case wrestling
with it, and the everlasting
vengeance of God, yea he may
bee given up to Sathan to bee
tempted to Atheisme, to blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy,
impatience, to despaire.
And herein hee may make all
that feare God and know him


<pb n="335" facs="tcp:27910:174"/>

(the blasphemy of the enemies
of God by his meanes.) And
though he by Gods mercy be
recovered perfectly, yet he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes
the scar to this day.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Salomon,</hi> besides these
things in <hi>David,</hi> fell much
more fearefully; so that his
Sunne seemed to set in a blacke
cloude. For it is questioned
this day by Divines, whether
he everrepented or no, or dyed
a reprobate. And the Lord hath
of purpose left him so without
any infallible and evident te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of his repentance,
though wee have arguments
enow from the Scriptures to
prove him to die the servant of
God.</p>
            <p>Now as this was a foule a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>basement
to <hi>Salomon,</hi> a man to
whom God had twice so appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
a man the wisest of men,

with God, credit in the
Church, that hath provoked on
many to good, and now him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
fallen from all, into the
contraries of all these? For
this is as if a rich man should
come to beggars state. I heard
of a woman so rich &amp; so proud,
as shee having her house neere

            <p>Now to a spirituall eye this

            <p>And the worst estate that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
a beleever can come to, yet
is better than the best of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleever.
We might as well fall
wholly and finally as thus farre,
and lye so long, but onely for
Gods unchangeable love and
good hand. And therefore


<pb n="340" facs="tcp:27910:177"/>
thanke we God that hath kept
us, when wee have seene others
fouly fallen.</p>
            <p>But this use hereof is to bee
made,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> to wit, to make all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
cast away pride, security,
and carelesnesse, and to walke
in holy reverence and humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
Some having gotten some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and finding some change,
boastingly will say, They have
now got past perishing; and as
for faith, that they can never
lose. But beware, and examine
well, lest this prove but a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
faith; for usually true
faith is jealous and suspicious
of its selfe. But if you cannot
perish nor quite lose your
faith, yet may you fall so farre
as may make you a spectacle &amp;
scorn to Angels and Men. What
if a man shall not bee hangd for
his faults? yet if he be whipt at
the Carts taile through divers
Market townes, set on the Pillo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and lose his eares, may not


<pb n="341" facs="tcp:27910:177"/>
this bee bad enough? therefore
beware of pride, and of the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
and carelesse use of the
meanes, and of the neglect of
them publicke and private, and
falling from the society of Gods
people, and of giving way to
our inward corruptions and
lusts, and of any grosse sinne:
or if we have dropt into any, let
us make haste by true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
to rise out of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.
Cling to God and to
the meanes, and a conscionable
humble use of them. And if
you feele any thing contrary,
spy it, and shake it off quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
lest yee bee brought by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
to this fearfull state.</p>
            <p>But what should such a one
doe that is fallen into this woe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
case? It is possible hee may
bee recovered: Oh if there bee
any such in this place, God
grant I may speake to your
hearts. I am sure I know such.
If there bee any here that lives


<pb n="342" facs="tcp:27910:178"/>
neere such, and have had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with them, I would
pray them to finde a time to
tell them from mee, nay from
the Lord, what you have heard,
and what course they must take
if ever they meane to attaine
unto salvation. These would
be holpe by praiers, especially
of those that have been provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
to goodnesse by their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
and callings; and they are
to know, that there is a possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of recovery, as wee see in
the Prodigall.</p>
            <p>To which end, they must a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>base
and throw downe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
before the Lord, in the
most lowly manner that they
can possibly, lying groveling
on the ground, kisse the earth;
yea, if they could possibly goe
under the earth: then they
must most humbly confesse and
rippe up all with a most heavie
heart, judging and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
themselves to the pit of


<pb n="343" facs="tcp:27910:178"/>
hell, and worthy to bee cut off
for ever: yea and aggravare
their vile sinnes by Gods great
mercy shewed to them above
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>Then must they lye downe
under the hand of God, being
content and willing that God
should doe with them in corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
as hee pleaseth; yea they
must cut themselves (in holy
revenge) short of some of their
lawfull liberties, and never
leave crying and pleading till
they obtaine some little hope.</p>
            <p>And if they feele but the
least moving of the Spirit and
comfort, Oh they must be high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thankefull, and follow it till
they have obtained it in greater
measure. Neyther must they
thinke to speed soon, but if they
can after long time, they have
cause to think themselves hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py;
neyther is it like that they
shall finde God easie to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
and found of them, who


<pb n="344" facs="tcp:27910:179"/>
have so much provoked him
to just displeasure. If with
much adoo and long earnest
seeking, comfort bee obtained,
they may thinke themselves
well. Then must they for ever
after abstaine from the very
appearance of evill, and cling
to the meanes, and suspect
themselves, even in their best
dueties, lest ever they should
decline againe, seeing then
their case would be worse than
ever it was before.</p>
            <p>Having shewed what faith
is,<note place="margin">Whether a man may know that he hath faith.</note> the cause, meanes, degrees,
and properties of it, it now
followeth, according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which I have propounded,
that I should set downe the
signes, by which examining
our selves, wee may certainely
know whether wee have a true
faith or no But because it is a
thing which is not granted of
all, that a man may ordinarily
attaine to this knowledge;


<pb n="345" facs="tcp:27910:179"/>
therefore before I come to
shew the companions, fruites,
and signes of faith, whereby e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man may try and examine
himselfe whether he hath true
faith or no, I will first handle
this question, Whether a man
may attaine to this knowledge:
that I may not seeme to begge
the question, or to ground the
following discourse upon an
uncertaine supposition ; and
first I will prove that it is possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
&amp; then how it may be done.</p>
            <p>First then it may appeare
that wee may certainley know
whether wee have true faith,
because the Apostle bids us <hi>try
our selves whether wee bee in the
faith:</hi> which he would not have
done, if it were a thing that
could not be tryed and knowne;
yea hee addeth further in the
same place, 2 <hi>Cor. 13. 5. Know
you not that Iesus Christ is in you,
except you be reprobates?</hi> Againe,
in 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 12. The Spirit of


<pb n="346" facs="tcp:27910:180"/>
God leaves us not to doubtfull
ghesses, what things God hath
given and we received, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
faith is one and a principall,
but would have us certainly to
know them, 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 3.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Of this certainety of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
we have also examples; as
of</hi> David, Psal 116 10. I belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
therefore have I spoken: Of
Iob, chap. 19. 25. I know that my
Redeemer liveth, &amp;c. <hi>And of</hi> Paul,
2. Tim. 1. 12. I know whom I have
beleeved, and Rom. 8 38. 39.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> Yea but these were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
men, and knew it
by extraordinary revelation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> No such thing; for
the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> telleth <hi>us,
2. Cor.</hi> 4. 13. that we have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the same Spirit of faith, <hi>i.e.</hi>
he and the rest of Gods Church
and children. Also the Eunuch.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Act</hi> 8 knew he beleeved, seeing
he professed his faith, &amp; desired
Baptisme for the confirming
there of. So the blindeman, <hi>Iohn</hi>


               <pb n="347" facs="tcp:27910:180"/>
9 38. saith, <hi>Lord I beleeve.</hi> So al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
this appeareth by the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of making the confession
of our faith; <hi>I beleeve,</hi> and so
forth: which sheweth, a man
may know that hee beleeveth.
Againe, if a man may bee assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and know that hee shall bee
saved (which I have proved
before) then he may know hee
hath faith, seeing there is no
salvation without it.</p>
            <p>And who can thinke that
God would worke so necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
a grace in his, and they shall
not know it? for what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
then were there of it?</p>
            <p>And finally, is this wrought
so secretly and lies it so still in
a man that hath it, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be discerned?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> The heart is deceitfull,
therefore who can know that
he hath saith?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> True, the heart of an
unregenerate man is deceitfull,
and a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ble false heart: but in


<pb n="348" facs="tcp:27910:181"/>
a regenerate man his heart is
made new and true, a single
and simple heart, <hi>Isa</hi> 38. 3. And
though a regenerate man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
know his heart in every
particular, and every winding
thereof in smaller things, yet
in all maine and essentiall
things he may know how it is
with him, especially being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to know as the servant of
God is. Cannot a man be truely
said to know his house that
knowes all the roomes of it,
though some odde hole under
the staires, or lobby in the top
of the house bee unknowne to
him?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> Many have thought
they have faith, and yet had
not; therefore wee may be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken
as well as they.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> This proves nothing,
because some have beene decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
therefore no man can tell.
Though some man dreame he
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ates and drinkes, or is greatly


<pb n="349" facs="tcp:27910:181"/>
rich, and waking findes it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
and that hee is poore and
hungry; this proves not but
that hee that hath meate, and
drinke, and riches, knoweth he
hath them, and is rich, Though
one in Bedlam besides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
having got a little peece
of paper in his hand, falsely
conceites that hee can shew all
kinde of learning out of it, and
that hee is wiser than all the
learned men in the Countrey,
this lets not, but that hee that is
truly learned may know that he
is so.</p>
            <p>And why is it that some
thinke they have faith, and
have not? It is because they
bee willing to deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
or else they might
know, but either they will not
try at all, or else so slightly they
will try themselves, or be tryed
of such as cannot or will not
trye them to the purpose: now
doth this let, but that they that


<pb n="350" facs="tcp:27910:182"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
            </p>
            <p>Some have received them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and others a long time,
as <hi>Iudas</hi> and many others, who
yet if they would have through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tryed themselves, or dealt
truely, and submitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to others tryall, might
have knowne: but not doing so,
no marvell though they be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
            <p>As for example, some coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
coyne is so like that
which is good and currant, as
that it is not easily discerned,
(as they say there is much
counterfeit gold abroad now,
brasse underward, but double
guilt on the outside) now if this
be not tryed at all, or by one
that toucheth it lightly, so that
it goes not thorow the guilt, it
may goe unknowne: but if this
be brought to a skilfull Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smith,


<pb n="351" facs="tcp:27910:182"/>
and tryed throughly
by the Touchstone, it may bee
knowne. And so it is in the
tryall of counterfeit faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> Some that have faith,
yet make great question and
doubt whether they have it or
no, nay cannot bee perswaded
they have any at all. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is not a thing that can
certainely be knowne.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> This particular proves
not against a generall, some
know not, therefore none doe
know, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>It is true some that have true
faith, yet are not sensible of it,
and know it not. They know
they have beene about it, but
know not certainly that God
hath wrought it. And these
be of two sorts, first, novices
who being newly come to
faith, are not acquainted with
the worke of God, and are
therefore jealous and suspicious
of themselves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as all true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers


<pb n="352" facs="tcp:27910:183"/>
are: yet this makes not
but that Christians of more
standing, &amp; that know the fruit
of Faith, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> know they have
it; and so shall they in time. As
<hi>Samuel</hi> was at first unacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with Gods voyce, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
called by God, went to E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>,
but afterwards hee made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to God, when hee called
him, as knowing that it was his
voyce: So these having some
answer, and comfort from
God, thinke it is but some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion
of the divell, or of their
owne heart; but upon better
knowledge and experience, they
know assuredly that it is God
who hath spoken this comfort
unto them by his Spirit.</p>
            <p>The other sort are beleevers
that be in some great and sore
temptation, who have knowne
that they have had faith, but
now indeed make doubt of it,
and in their owne feeling have
none. Yet this makes not, but


<pb n="353" facs="tcp:27910:183"/>
that they that bee in no such
temptation doe know their
faith; And that these also in
time, when the temptation is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
shall know it againe. As
for example, A man by accident
having gotten a great blow on
the head, or being in some fit of
a burning Ague, knoweth not
what he saith, or doth, or hath;
yet others that bee not in this
case may and doe know, and so
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hall hee againe, when his fit is

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ff, and hee come to himselfe.
And so also it is with some
Christians, when they are in
the fit of tentations, or spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hese are over, then they are

               </gap>ave it, though not every one

               </gap>hem that know not whether


<pb n="354" facs="tcp:27910:184"/>
they have faith, yea or no, and
yet are content to goe by
thinkes. Goe from one end of
the Church to the other, and
how few can make a wise an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to this question, <hi>Have ye
any faith?</hi> I hope, or I thinke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
have, will some say. Doe you
goe by <hi>thinkes?</hi> Doe you but
<hi>thinke</hi> so? what, is it because you
cannot come to know? what a
shame is this, that you suffer
such a necessary thing to hang
by the eye-lids? what if God
had taken you away, or deeply
visited you? would (<hi>thinkes</hi>)
have, comforted or carryed you
through? Doe you but <hi>thinke</hi>
so? I <hi>thinke</hi> you may perish for
all this. Yea have you beene
long at this passe, and doe you
but <hi>thinke so,</hi> and yet are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
content? then I doe not
thinke, but am sure, that you
have no faith at all: for if you
had any, you would not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with <hi>thinkes,</hi> but desire


<pb n="355" facs="tcp:27910:184"/>
to make it sure.</p>
            <p>Some poore weake, yet true
Christian, is not indeed cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of it, but yet they faine
would bee, and are not content
to continue in that case.</p>
            <p>You goe not by <hi>thinkes</hi> for
your evidence of your house
and land: or if you did so
sometimes, yet hearing of some
claime laid to your land, you
have searcht it out, and had
counsell; And now you say, I
have them in my boxe lockt up
sure, I feare no man: So saith
a true and wise Christian, <hi>I have
my Evidences here laid up in my
heart,</hi> I would bee loth they
were to seeke now.</p>
            <p>2. It serveth also to rebuke
them that deceive themselves
by thinking they have faith,
when it is nothing so. What, is
it because they could not
know? If they be deceived, it
is the divell and their owne
hearts that have deceived


<pb n="356" facs="tcp:27910:185"/>
them, for God hath provided
that they might know.</p>
            <p>But people are willing to be
beguiled, else they would try
better. Now what madnesse is
this to deceive ones selfe in
that, whereupon lyes our utter
undoing?</p>
            <p>3. It serveth likewise for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
to all, and to teach
them to take paines to know
out this matter.</p>
            <p>For hath God beene so gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
as for our comfort to
give us meanes, by which wee
may know assuredly how it
stands with us, and shall we be
slothfull and negligent in the
use of them, and so hinder our
knowledge and assurance?</p>
            <p>The fourth use respects those
that know, and can well prove
they have faith, (let them bee
highly thankfull to God that
provided such meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they are come to this blessed
estate, and hath made them


<pb n="357" facs="tcp:27910:185"/>
also so happy as to know it) oh
what a jewell is this, so to
know that they are in the state
of grace, that they are the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God, &amp; that all shall turn
to their good here, and to their
everlasting glory hereafter,
seeing hereby they are fitted to
goe through prosperity, and
adversitie, life and death!</p>
            <p>And for them that have faith,
and yet for unskilfulnesse, by
reason of their small experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
never knew it, or by temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
have lost the feeling of
it; they are to know, that it
may be so, they know it not, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they have it: For as
many children have right to
lands, that know not of it, so is
it with them in respect of their
heavenly inheritance.</p>
            <p>So likewise the other in
temptation, must yet for a
while bee judged by others ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than by themselves; which
if they doe, they shall come to


<pb n="358" facs="tcp:27910:186"/>
see it with their owne eies
shortly, if they diligently use
the meanes to attaine unto it.</p>
            <p>And thus having proved
that wee may come to this
knowledge and assurance that
wee have a true faith;<note place="margin">Of the signes of Faith.</note> I will
shew in the next place how we
may come to know it, setting
downe those infallible markes
and signes of faith, upon which
wee may safely ground our
knowledge. Wee may know
that we have faith by the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and consequents
thereof; by the causes of it, and
the effects; by what went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

               </gap>
are to know, that we may have
the best judgement here of, not
by one of these alone, but by
considering them all together.
For if wee judge onely by the


<pb n="359" facs="tcp:27910:186"/>
fruits of faith (as most doe) and
never looke to the causes,
meanes, and manner of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it, wee may be deceived,
seeing an hypocrite may doe
many things which might well
beseeme a beleever, and goe
far in many dueties, and in the
reforming of many outward
evills, and yet in the meane
while is utterly desthtute of a
true justifying faith. And many
times the fruits in a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
bee so weake, especially at
some times, and in respect of
their owne feeling, as if we goe
by these only, hypocriticall and
counterfeit faith will be taken
for true faith, and true faith
counted no faith. But when we
conjoine them, them both give
evidence each to othen, and
both together give such strong
and certaine assurance to him
that hath them, that can not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him. And therefore it will
doe well it wee join; these one


<pb n="360" facs="tcp:27910:187"/>
with the other. If one can go
along with them all, though it
be but weakly, yet he shall have
better evidence than hee that
hath but one or two, though
they seeme to bee in a greater
measure, &amp; nothing of some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at all. For hereby many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
themselves, whilest they
go by halfes, snatching up some
things, and nothing at all in
many other. First then wee
will examine our faith by the
causes of it. If a man be brought
along to faith by those steppes
that God brings his to faith
by, that is a good evidence that
he hath faith. As if a man bee
going to a place, and hath been
told by one skilful in the way,
that hee must goe by such a
Church, then by a tust of ashes,
and a foure way leet, then by
such and such a marke: If hee
goe by these one after the other
till he come to the place, hee
concludes that is the place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause


<pb n="361" facs="tcp:27910:187"/>
he came by every of those
marks which before were told
him: not by some one or two,
but all of them one after the
other; and not by things like
them, but the selfe same he vvas
told of. And so also vve may
be assured that vve are come to
have true faith, vvhen vve can
discerne in us the markes and
signs of it concurring together.</p>
            <p>The steppes by vvhich God
bringeth a man to faith by the
working of the Law and the
Gospell, I have handled at
large. I now referre them to
three heads, Illumination, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation,
and Desire after
Christ. First for Illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
God enlightens the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
vvith the sight and
knowledge of the miserable
state vvherein vve stand by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of sinne and punishment,
and our unability to get out of
it of our selves. And this not
only in generall, but particular,


<pb n="362" facs="tcp:27910:188"/>
that that is my state. And then
by the Gospell enlightens him
vvith the knowledge of the
doctrine of Redemption by
Christ, as, that God hath of his
free grace appointed a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
meanes of salvation by
Christ Iesus, and that by his
death, and sufferings, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
&amp;c. &amp; that he hath done
this, though not for all, yet for
all beleevers, and onely for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers;
and that hee may have
his part in it, if hee can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve.
And though this bee but
small, yet it is the first step, and
not to bee left out; for many
come not thus farre. As for all
ignorant persons that know
not these things in some sort,
they have no faith; and if they
thinke they have, it is a vaine
shadow, and no such matter,
nor possible. And therefore ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
persons must berowzed
up to know these things.</p>
            <p>Next, God humbles all that


<pb n="363" facs="tcp:27910:188"/>
he vvill vvork faith in; and first
hee smites them vvith terrour
by the Law, for the miserable
state they see and feele them
selves in, and casts them down,
though not all in like degree, as
I have said before: then the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell
offering mercy and spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
so kindly to all, though
never so bad, if they doe not
exclude themselves. And this
breakes the heart with griefe
for sinning against so patient a
God as God hath beene to him
all his dayes of rebellion, and
that now offers him mercy.
Thus hee is in a holy despaire of
any helpe or good in himselfe,<note place="margin">Ezra. 9. 6.</note>
and is ashamed and confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in himselfe,<note place="margin">Dan. 9. 7.</note> willing to take
any course that God shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
him; saying with the
laylour. <hi>Acts 16. 30. What shall
I doe to be saved?</hi> but resolving
never to goe backe to his old
course, or to doe as hee hath
done. And thus he is cast down


<pb n="364" facs="tcp:27910:189"/>
weary, sick, and lost.</p>
            <p>Thence God brings him to a
desire after Christ, and to have
pardon in him &amp; the favour of
God. Not a cold lazie wish, as of
<hi>Balaam,</hi> that he might die the
death of the righteous, without
any indeavour to live their
life: but the panting of the
heart, sighing, longing, and
groning, as the Hart brayeth
after the river of waters, <hi>Psal.</hi>
42. 1. Which inward longing
and desire of the heart, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest
and uttered by humble
confession and condemning of
himselfe, and with earnest cries
for mercy, as we see in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of the Publicane and the
Prodigall.</p>
            <p>And then he further worketh
in him that hungering after
Christ, and thirsting that can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
no delay, but breaketh
through stone walls, useth all
meanes of obtaining Christ, and
preferres him before all the


<pb n="365" facs="tcp:27910:189"/>
world. And maketh him willing
and ready to sell all, to buy the
pearle, that is, the most profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
or pleasing sins.</p>
            <p>Now let us try our selves
faithfully,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> by these two latter
signes, and the particulars of
them, and as our heart maketh
answer, so make use of it. If
we cannot deny, but God hath
thus dealt with us, then who
dare speake against this? And
therefore if this bee your case,
you must take knowledge of it
and bee comforted, seeing they
are much to bee blamed, who
though they cannot deny but
that it hath been thus and thus
with them, yet still doubt they
have no faith, and thinke that
they never begun right. For
what would these have to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
them? Is there any thing
more sure to bee built on than
the Word of God? and will not
this serve your turnes?</p>
            <p>It is true I grant that it is


<pb n="366" facs="tcp:27910:190"/>
good making sure of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
and herein one cannot
be too carefull; yet where it is
well, it is well. If one have
digged to a firme bottome, and
cast out all the light earth, and
then have laid the foundation
and groundsells of his house,
and every body, and even skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
workemen say it is well,
shall one yet goe and pull it up
againe, &amp; say one cannot be too
carefull? such an one may justly
be thought weak and childish:
so is it also in our spirituall
building.</p>
            <p>There are therefore two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamities
here to be avoided;
the one to be carelesse in laying
a good foundation; the other
out of needlesse scrupulosity to
spend all our time and paines a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it, and never to go forward
in the building that we may fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
it. And at this passe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
holds many a long time,
which is very unprofitable, and


<pb n="367" facs="tcp:27910:190"/>
they complaine of their dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and many other faults,
when this doubtfulnesse and
unbeleefe is the maine cause.</p>
            <p>But where these proceedings
have not beene (as in how few
are they to bee found) there is
no faith; and therefore such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
in the state of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to this day. In which
case there are very many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
at this day, seeing few
be humbled; many continue
prophane persons, and onely ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy
righteous persons; and
some are onely slightly hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
and having got comfort
are never more grieved, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
a true beleever even after
faith, grieves still for his daily
sinnes, whereas these thinke it
enough that they were once
grieved, and therefore now
grieve no more for their foule
sinnes. How few can bee
brought on their knees? or to
trouble themselves in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming


<pb n="368" facs="tcp:27910:191"/>
to a holy despaire in
themselves, and how few come
to be teachable, or to make an
holy use of what they have
learned?</p>
            <p>Oh they are too jolly, they
cannot away with any such sad
matters; and well they reserve
it, till they may have it in Hell,
world without end.</p>
            <p>How few also (as it might
easily be shewed) are they that
come to any other desire after
Christ except lazy wishes? for
why, they have no sense of their
owne misery.</p>
            <p>How few come to those
humble confessions and hearty
cryings to God for mercy, but
content themselves with that
late and lazie <hi>Lord have mercy
upon mee?</hi> Some feele in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
flashings at starts and fits,
after a stirring Sermon, or after
they have beene in the house of
mourning, or seene some heavy
hand of God, or are in some


<pb n="369" facs="tcp:27910:191"/>
affiction: but how few attaine
to that high prizing of Christ,
and that thirsting after him?
Oh no, they prize at too high a
rate, other bables of profits
and pleasures, to make high ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of Christ. Others will,
as farre as they can have Christ
and the world together, but if
they must needs part with one,
they will leave Christ rather
than the world.</p>
            <p>And whereas Christ requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
that they should sell all to
purchase the pearle, they will
part only with some, but not all,
and so God and they part. And
surely well worthy is hee to
lose his part in Christ and all
his benefics, that preferres any
lust before him, and the favour
of God: These set too base
a price on Christ ever to have
any part in him.</p>
            <p>And here we might well take
occasion to lament the misery
of most people whom God


<pb n="370" facs="tcp:27910:192"/>
hath made happy in the meanes
of faith and salvation, only they
make themselves negligently
and wilfully miserable for want
of grace to make use thereof.
Here then such people are to be
exhorted that they would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinke
themselves, and while
life and meanes of grace last,
that they lay about them to bee
possessed of this unvaluable
pearle, which if they get, is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to make them happy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
and if they misse it, all
things else will doe them no
pleasure.</p>
            <p>By the plentifull meanes
which through Gods mercy we
enjoy, he maketh us more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
than most of the world. But
by our owne carelesnesse and
contempt, wee will make our
selves more miserable than
they. The Lord open peoples
eyes.</p>
            <p>Moreover, wee may know
that we have a true faith by the


<pb n="371" facs="tcp:27910:192"/>
companions and fruits of it,
which I will here briefly goe
through. Some be markes and
companions of a Faith that
hath attained some degree and
strength. And in this number
is peace of conscience, which
if it be sound, is an evident
signe of a strong faith, as might
(if it were needfull) be shewed
at large. For it might be proved
by Scripture, that Peace comes
from Beleeving, and that it
must needs bring strange peace,
where trouble was before.<note place="margin">See <hi>Gouge</hi> on the Eph. 6. 17 in the point of Faith. And <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ses of the eighth companion of Faith.</note> And
howsoever there bee a counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
of this peace in hypocrites,
yet when tryalls and tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
come, it will soone vanish,
and so easily be discerned from
the true peace of the faithfull.</p>
            <p>And joy of the holy Ghost
<hi>unspeakable and glorious. 1 Pet.</hi> 1.
8. Also thankfulnesse to God, as
<hi>Psal.</hi> 116. 12. and <hi>Psalme</hi> 103. 1.
Now what counterfeit of it is
in the hypocrites or wicked?


<pb n="372" facs="tcp:27910:193"/>
and how it differs from their
joy, and how it may bee inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted:
How also wee are to
admire at the unspeakable
goodnesse of God, both for the
greatnesse of the mercy, the
rarenesse of it, seeing it is gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to so few: Also at his daily
bearing with our weaknesses,
&amp; faults. But these are points al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
handled by these authors
I last quoted, and therefore for
more brevity sake I referre the
Christian reader onto them.</p>
            <p>Another companion of a
strong faith is bold confession
of the name and truth of God,
even before the enemies there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p>Also contempt of this world,
willingnesse to dye, and lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
to bee at home with the
Lord Iesus.</p>
            <p>But besides these markes of
a strong faith, there are other
signes of the smallest measure
of true faith.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="373" facs="tcp:27910:193"/>
First, a purified heart, <hi>Acts</hi>
15. 9. and a change wrought in
it from the love of all evill, to
the love of God and all his
commandements.</p>
            <p>Secondly, a reformed life in
one thing as well as in another,
little as well as great, to God
as well as to men, secret and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly;
and that not by fits, but
at all times.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, love to God, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by our care to please him,
our feare to offend him, our
griefe when wee have done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse.
And also love to them
that love God.</p>
            <p>Love for his sake to men, and
even an indevour to love our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.</p>
            <p>Now this love towards o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
is declared by doing good
unto them according to their
need and our owne abilitie, and
by forgiving them that wrong
us.</p>
            <p>But especially we shall shew


<pb n="374" facs="tcp:27910:194"/>
that we have a lively faith by
loving the Saints in whom
Gods Image shines most, &amp; who
are most deare to God, and from
whom wee may get most good.</p>
            <p>And those that be not yet, to
seeke to winne them on, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
them under our care, or
such as are neere to us; as pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
their children, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
sometimes their parents,
one neighbour another; as
<hi>Mat.</hi> 9 &amp; <hi>Acts 16. Psal.</hi> 51. 13.
Then shall I teach transgresson
the way, and sinners shall bee
converted unto thee. <hi>Isa.</hi> 2. 1.
So <hi>Philip</hi> being called, findes
<hi>Nathanael,</hi> and bringeth him to
Christ,<hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 45.</p>
            <p>Another signe of Faith, is,
when those that beleeve have
an carnest desire after more
faith; and therefore a care to
use the meanes for that end
and purpose. For finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
weake, and the divell bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
in opposing their faith, they


<pb n="375" facs="tcp:27910:194"/>
desire to have it strengthened,
and having gotten some assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
they desire a stronger,
as the Eunuch, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
tasted so sweet a thing,
they desire more of it: and
therefore they long for the
meanes from Sabbath to Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
Sacrament to Sacrament,
and for good companie.</p>
            <p>Also true faith is jealous of it
selfe, and desires to trie it selfe,
and is willing to be tryed by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
and the most searching
ministrie pleaseth him best that
hath it, or the Minister or
friend that will sift him most
throughly.</p>
            <p>The use is, that every one of
us trie our selves,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> by these
signes: And if our hearts can
say in Gods presence without
dissembling, that both God
hath thus brought us along, and
then that wee finde these com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
last named, then know,
that God hath wrought true


<pb n="376" facs="tcp:27910:195"/>
faith in you and done that for
you that he hath done for few,
that ever were, are, or shall be, &amp;
that which is of more worth
than the whole world. Take
knowledge of it that you may
be thankefull, and comfort you
shall have enough, to doe, to
nourish it, and walke worthy of
it, and to goe through this evill
world, though you doe not
stand with its and ands, being
doubtfull and uncertaine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you have faith or no. The
divell labours to hinder you
from proceeding, seeing hee
could not let your comming
thus farre. It is a great hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
to profiting, when peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are not resolved whether
they have yet any faith: If you
can abide the weight of the
Sanctuary, conclude upon it;
you can have no surer ground
to build on than the Word of God.</p>
            <p>You complaine of dulnesse,


<pb n="377" facs="tcp:27910:195"/>
when your selves are the cause:
where these things bee, know
that there is true faith; men do
not gather grapes of thornes,
nor figges of thistles; <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.
16.</p>
            <p>Againe, if there bee no faith,
but where these antecedents
and consequents bee, then I te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
to the world, that there is
very little faith in the land of
England, as might easily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
if I should goe over the
severall fruits of Faith before
specified. For how few have
purified their hearts? how
few have any earnest endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
or any hungring or
thirsting after Christ and his
righteousnesse? how many
have their hearts fraught
with the love of all evill?
how few either reformed at all,
or but where they list, and by
fits?</p>
            <p>And yet whosoever lives in
any one knowne sinne, let him


<pb n="378" facs="tcp:27910:196"/>
know to his face, hee hath no
true Faith. By which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth,
that there be but a few
beleevers; the more shame for
them that have had all that
meanes.</p>
            <p>How few are there that love
their neighbours, seeing all
contraries to love abound? and
as for love to the Saints, that
they doe as a dog a pitch-fork,
seeing they cannot of all sawce
abide them.</p>
            <p>As for desire after the means;
a Sermon, or no Sermon, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or no Sacrament, all i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
one; and for being examined,
they will none of that, no, they
doe not meane it: they have a
figgetree, but it will bee cursed
because of the barrennesse.</p>
            <p>Well, many talke of Faith,
but assuredly it is but as Saint
<hi>Iames</hi> saith, a dead Faith, that
will doe them as little pleasure
when time comes, as a dead
horse will him that hath a long


<pb n="379" facs="tcp:27910:196"/>
journey to ride. Oh have none
Faith but such as you talke of?
It shall be as the Lord will; and
as hee hath set downe in his
Word: where these signes bee
not, assuredly there can bee no
Faith.</p>
            <p>True Faith is a Lady or
Queene, attended by a great
traine of many excellent ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues:
<note place="margin">1. Pet. 5. 6.</note> shew me thy Faith by thy
workes, shew a great Lady by
her traine; even this great La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Faith by that great traine of
graces, with which the Apostle
Peter saith it is attended, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi>
1. 5. 6. 7. &amp;c. Therfore that Faith
the world talkes on, which is
but a formall profession of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
without all power of true
godlinesse, is but a roguish
Faith that goeth alone basely,
or a raggamuffianly Faith that
hath a sorry ragged reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and some shewes of some
vertues, but none sound and
substantiall. The times that


<pb n="380" facs="tcp:27910:197"/>
wee have lived in and enjoyed
the Gospell, may challenge
more than such a vaine Faith,
which the smallest meanes and
the dimmest times might have
wrought and challenged.</p>
            <p>And thus much of the signes
of Faith:<note place="margin">Of the lets and inpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments of faith.</note> now it followeth in

of the lets and impediments,
whereby men are usually hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
from attaining unto it.
To which end wee are to know,
that there bee many lets within
and without men to keep them
from Faith; and so great, as few
ever attaine it. True it is there
bee many helpes to Faith, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>louts, as old <hi>Simeon</hi> and many
others. Also in them that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in him when hee went up
and downe as a man of no repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
But wee know Christ
to be dead, risen the third day,
ascended into heaven, and sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
at the right hand of God
in unspeakeable glory, having
overcome all his and our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:
and therefore now it is
much more easie to beleeve
than in those daies; And also we
have the new Testament, Christ
come out of his fathers bosome,
all things so cleere and plaine,
plentifull promises, and heaven
(as it were) set open: wee have
the Word and Sacraments,
wherein Christ is crucified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore


<pb n="382" facs="tcp:27910:198"/>
our eyes; the Ministers of
God beseeching us to bee
through faith in Christ recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
unto God, 2.<hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20. We
have also many worthy exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of beleevers gone before
us, Martyrs and godly men and
women among us, that lived
and dyed in the comfort of
their faith, and are gone to
rest. Many examples likewise of
the fearefull judgements of
God against unbeleevers. Yet
there be also many lets to faith,
and these both from our selves,
and also from the divell, and
the world.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The first Let is Ignorance, a
strong &amp; invincible bar, seeing
there can not possibly bee any
true faith without competent
knowledge of the principles of
Religion. This is very common,
sometimes through the fault of
Ministers, that either preach
not, or very seldome, or after a
flanting manner, soaring aloft


<pb n="383" facs="tcp:27910:198"/>
the peoples capacity, and not
stouping to their weaknesse, or
not Catechising and opening
in order, and handling the
grounds of Religion. Some al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
from the people themselves;
for if Ministers were more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective,
yet there is light in the
Word, and men might with
paines get knowledge: and
therefore peoples ignorance is
affected and wilfull. Some care
not for comming at the Word
at all: the rich have oxen,
farmes, pleasures to hinder
them, the poore sit by the fire,
or lye in bedde, or if they come,
they sit and sleepe, or looke up
and downe, not minding what
they heare, and so the devill
steales it all away. Some never
thinke nor speake more of it
when they bee out of the
Chruch.</p>
            <p>In which regard the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of the Gospell are to bee
perswaded, for the love of God,


<pb n="384" facs="tcp:27910:199"/>
to have a care and compassion
of the peoples soules, in assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of a blessed reward, and
to take paines, and wise and fit
paines too, that so if the people
get not faith, yet the let might
not be in us.</p>
            <p>For the people also, they are
to bee perswaded to rowze up
themselves to the getting of
knowledge, that so they may
bee fitted to attaine unto faith.</p>
            <p>The second Let is the light
esteeming of the Gospell: As
there are few that be cast down
by the Law or bee moved, so
they make as light account of
the Gospell; it is not precious,
nay scarce welcome to them.
They thinke that God in offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
salvation by Christ, and
tendring the promise, seeks his
owne good and not theirs, and
that God should bee beholding
to them if they receive the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell,
rather than they to God
for making such an offer;


<pb n="385" facs="tcp:27910:199"/>
whereas they should fall down
and blesse the Lord that ever
such tidings should sound in
their eares.</p>
            <p>3. Some thinke it impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to be assured of the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of their sinnes and of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
and therefore never go
about it.</p>
            <p>This is but their owne
wretched lazinesse, furthered
by Sathan; for it is nothing so.
The impossibility lies in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but in themselves; if their
proud stomackes could but
stoope, and come downe to see
and feele their vilenesse, and to
goe out of themselves, and to
seeke for salvation by faith in
Christ, and could but renounce
all their beloved lusts, it would
be possible enough, yea easie;
but that they will not doe. But
hath not God commanded us
to <hi>give all diligence to make our
Election and Calling sure? 2. Pet.</hi> 1.
10. And is it not then our


<pb n="386" facs="tcp:27910:200"/>
owne fault if we neglect it?</p>
            <p>4. Some thinke it not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible,
but exceeding difficult
and therefore like the sluggard
that will not put his hand to
his mouth, nor out of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
nor goe out into the cold
to provide necessaries for the
preserving of his life and so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
and perisheth in his sloth; so
is it with these lazie Christians
in this case, whereas the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
(there being a possibility)
should but whet on their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
especially seeing it is for a
thing infinitely of value, and
more worth than all their pains
which they take for the obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of it. See what difficulties
men goe through by sea and
land for a little pelfe, and shall
wee bee lesse painfull in seeking
for the rich treasures of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
grace and heavenly glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie?</p>
            <p>5. Some thinke it needlesse,
because they suppose that they


<pb n="387" facs="tcp:27910:200"/>
may be saved without so much
adoo. A good hope indeede is
well; but if troubles and death
come, they shall finde all the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
they can get little e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to carry them through,
yea to helpe them to mortifie
their lusts, corruptions, and
carnall affections, or to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
them in a good course.</p>
            <p>6. Some bee conceited of
their owne righteousnesse, and
so thinke they have no neede
to labour much after faith in
Christ; like the Laodicean and
Pharisee, and the yongue man
in the Gospell, All these have I
kept from my youth. The civill
man thinkes to bee saved by
keeping touch, living orderly,
keeping his Church, and pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
every man his owne, and
by being liberall in giving
almes to the poore: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thinkes himselfe in case
good enough, without going
out of himselfe or making such


<pb n="388" facs="tcp:27910:201"/>
adoe, what shall they need the
Gospell that can keepe the
Law? or if they faile in some
things, yet by that time, God
hath set the good against the
bad, they hope there will be no
great oddes betweene them.</p>
            <p>But these men must know
and confesse their Civility, and
carnall wisedome and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
to bee dogs meate and
abominable in Gods sight, and
cast it all downe,<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 8.</note> as <hi>Paul</hi> did, or
else they shall never finde mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
with God: Nay friend, God
hath put in a strong barre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
a mans own righteousnes,
so that there can be no going to
heaven that way. Doest thou
boast of a filthy clout?</p>
            <p>6. Some are so prophane, as
that they will not bee stirred by
all the terrours of the Law, and
so goe not one step to faith.</p>
            <p>Some are cast downe, but
weare it out againe, being utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
impatient of the paine and
burthen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="389" facs="tcp:27910:201"/>
Some beginning to sorrow
some what for sinne, as soone as
they feele any, straight cast the
whole burthen on Christ, and
so never tarry till they come to
hunger and thirst after him.</p>
            <p>Some seeming contrite, and
having many good parts, yet
stand with God for a little, and
will not part with some one
lust that spoyles all. And these
never buy because they will not
come to the full price, and God
will abate nothing of it.</p>
            <p>8. Some thinke if they
should begin, they should never
hold out, and therefore that
they were as good not begin at
all. But let such get forth first
and make some entrance into
the course of Christianitie, and
then take thought for the other
after.</p>
            <p>9. Some thinke they must
not only part with their belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and profitable sinne, if they
would come to this faith, but


<pb n="390" facs="tcp:27910:202"/>
also that they must take paines
to take up a strickt course of
godlinesse, which will require
much labour, and abridge them
of many delights and profits,
of which they cannot thinke
with any patience. And will
not thinke you, the pleasure,
comfort, and benefit of faith
pay for all these, and make you
great gainers by the exchange?</p>
            <p>10. Some thinke they shall
bee mockt, reproacht, and
scorn'd as Purita<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s,<note place="margin">Ioh. 5. 44.</note> cast off by
their friends, huncht at, and
jusled to the wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, of which
disgraces they are utterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient;
and the love of the
friendship of this world is
a great let to many. And indeed
in it selfe it is no small matter
to endure all these, if wee have
no other strength but our owne
naturall abilities.</p>
            <p>But to these I give this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
if thou gettest favour
with God, whose soever friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship


<pb n="391" facs="tcp:27910:202"/>
thou losest, yet art thou
happy. If thou losest prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or beest jusled and despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in the world, yet thou must
rejoyce in thy gaines by Faith,
for the time will come, when
they that doe it, will wish they
had beene thy halfe.</p>
            <p>This vile <hi>amity with the world
is the enmity of God, I am.</hi> 4. 4.
and he that will have the
worlds good will, let him
know, he can never have Gods.
<hi>Wee cannot serve God and Mam<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon,
Math.</hi> 6. 24.</p>
            <p>The divell also will lay in
such a number of objections,<note place="margin">Divell.</note>
and stumoling blockes, as wee
cannot passe by without some
paines and difficultie. As he will
for before us the falls of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessours,
and the varietie and
difference of opinions in points
of religion which are among
those that professe Christiani<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie.
Seest thou not, will he say,
that there be some of one, some


<pb n="392" facs="tcp:27910:203"/>
of another opinion? some
thinke that we may bee assured
of our salvation, some say nays<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Therefore never trouble thy
head with any thing at all, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
thy businesse and live qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly.
Also thou seest that most
Noblemen, Gentlemen, and
great ones, trouble not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with any such thing, nay
many Preachers and learned
men live at their pleasure; and
therefore bee not thou so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise,
nor make such scruple.</p>
            <p>Also he labours to keepe the
faithfull preaching of the
Word, from a place or people,
or at least to make it ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.
Also he makes them beleeve
that they have it, when they
have it not, but onely a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
faith or presumptuous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit.</p>
            <p>The temptations also of the
world are great lets to faith.
First the love of the world,
and eagernesse after it, lets ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many


<pb n="393" facs="tcp:27910:203"/>
from faith. And how
excellently well might many
doe, if it were not for the
world? But that must goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
whatsoever the Word,
Sacrament, Sabbath, or any
thing else doth. They have no
leisure to set their hearts on
these, for their many and great
imployments. Or if they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
the world puts it out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
and choakes the Word,
and every good thought.</p>
            <p>Moreover,<note place="margin">Example.</note> the small num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that labour after Faith, or
take any such paines to get it, is
no small let to the obtaining of
it; two in a parish, and three
in a Towne, one in a Hamlet,
and for a man to goe alone, and
to be a wonder in Israell, is a
thing much against the haire.</p>
            <p>To goe against the streame is
hard. But if you will needs
follow the multitude, you must
speed as they doe. You should
know that the way to heaven,


<pb n="394" facs="tcp:27910:204"/>
is straite, and few finde it, and
so be content to goe alone to
heaven rather than not at all.</p>
            <p>Their bad counsell likewise is
another great let: for they that
give ill example bee as bad of
their tongues as in their lives,<note place="margin">Counsell.</note>
being ready thus to baite
and taunt you. Oh you bee so
precise, and shall no bodie bee
saved but you, and a few more?
what is become of our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers,
who made no such a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe,
and yet I hope you will
not say, but that they are saved?
and what shall become of
Lords, Ladies, Gentlemen, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Ministers and learned men,
that doe not thus, and of most
part of the people? you will
bee wiser than all your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>
            <p>This is I confesse no small
thing to beare and resist. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of good hopes have from
this a great let in their way.
Some come flattering, some


<pb n="395" facs="tcp:27910:204"/>
perswading by worldly wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
and will bee incensed to
anger if you hearken not unto
them.</p>
            <p>If these prevaile not,<note place="margin">Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> then
they raise up Persecution, and
as hard measure as the times
and lawes will give leave.</p>
            <p>No marvell then so few come
to faith.</p>
            <p>2. If any,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> will come to faith
(which they must doe, or else
they shall never come to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven)
then make account to
have lets enow, and to meete
with an armie of Hindrances:
and therefore provide your
selves accordingly, and bee
couragious and resolute; for if
any thing will hinder you, you
will never come to faith.</p>
            <p>And let them in whom this
true faith is, praise God, and
wondring at his gracious boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
make much of it. Let this
be the second use, admiring his
mercy that he should helpe us


<pb n="396" facs="tcp:27910:205"/>
thorow so many lets.</p>
            <p>Let nothing hinder us from
getting faith, for then wee lose
our soules, therefore resolve to
breake thorow all, and bid the
flesh, world, divell, stand backe,
casting off feare, and favour,
leaving off beloved sinnes, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
paines, in the godly life,
with the rest of this kinde,
which let and hinder many, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they doe not shake them
off.</p>
            <p>And know that if every of
these lets be well weighed, they
will appeare to bee but toyes,
shewes and fraybugges, and not
of moment: wee should there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
breake them off, as <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
the cords, and take leave to
save our soules. But if wee be
tyed by these as a drunken
man is hang'd many houres by
a bush in his path, it is a signe
that we are left of God to bee
snared and taken: for they that
are of God stride over them,


<pb n="397" facs="tcp:27910:205"/>
like <hi>David</hi> leape over a wall, &amp;
are content rather to go alone to
heaven, thah with company to
hell. Yea though we meet with
Persecution, let it not hinder
our Christian course, seeing <hi>all
that will live godly with Christ,
must suffer persecution, and if we
suffer with him, wee shall likewise
raigne with him, 2. Tim.</hi> 3. 12. and
2. 12.</p>
            <p>But rather seeing God hath
given us so many helpes, let us
use them carefully, and listen
to Gods reasons which hee
useth to move us to faith,
which be weighty; as, his high
esteeme of it, his readinesse to
helpe, and the infinite benefits
that come to us by beleeving:
and contrariwise the infinite
punishments that come upon
unbeleevers both in this world,
and the world to come.</p>
            <p>Every one of which reasons is
sufficient to weigh downe all
that can be objected to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="398" facs="tcp:27910:206"/>
And so much of the lets and
impediments of Faith: now
it followeth in the last place
that I intreate of the contraries
of Faith, by which it is most
opposed.</p>
            <p>The contraries to Faith are
Vnbeleefe on the one side,<note place="margin">Contraries to faith.</note> and
Presumption on the other; for
every vertue is in the midst be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
two vices, as Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
two theeves, as liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
betweene covetousnesse and
prodigality</p>
            <p>So is this Faith betweene
Vnbeleefe which falleth short,<note place="margin">Vnbeleefe.</note>
and Presumption that shootes
as farre over. These be as two
dangerous rockes, and Faith
sailes safely to Heaven between
them both. But most, split
themselves on the one or the
other of these: one beleeves not
where there is a promise, the
other beleeves where God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
spake. First I will speake
of Vnbeleefe, which is when


<pb n="399" facs="tcp:27910:206"/>
men beleeve not the Word of
God; for Faith hath respect
unto the Word, and builds up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, and beleeves it, but Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleefe
doth not so.</p>
            <p>Now as in Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there bee
three things, Knowledge, As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
and Application, or Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension;
so there bee three
sorts of Vnbeleevers, some ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,
not knowing the will
of God; some knowing, and
not assenting to it, but denying
it; some knowing and assen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and yet not particularly
applying it to themselves. And
of these I will speake severally.</p>
            <p>And first of the Ignorant,
which bee of two sorts; first
such as have no meanes of
Knowledge: as Pagans, that
live farre out of the pale of the
Church, and from the sound
of the Word, that never heard
of the true God, of mans mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
of Christ Iesus; these not
knowing, cannot possibly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve.


<pb n="400" facs="tcp:27910:207"/>
This is one kind of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers
who are under a woful<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>

they have no cloake for their
sinne.</hi> This Ignorance doth
not wholly excuse any, partly
because of the light which wee
have voluntarily lost in <hi>Adam;</hi>
&amp; because it is Gods just judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for their sinnes, that they
have not the Gospell. Those
that have meanes, eyther lesse

            <p>Secondly, such as know the
Word of God, but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
not the truth of it, but
deny it: as lewes and Turkes
that acknowledge the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,
and deny the new,
and Iesus Christ the summe of
both: Papists that acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
Christ but in part,, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
him but a part of a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
by joyning partners with
him in all his offices.</p>
            <p>Also Atheists and Epicures
that deny all, God or Devill,
Heaven or Hell, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality
of the soule. The


<pb n="403" facs="tcp:27910:208"/>
family of love that turne all
the Scriptures into an allegory,
and so deny all, are also a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
kind of unbeleevers.</p>
            <p>So also all others that deny
eyther the whole Scripture, or
any fundamentall points of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>3. Such as know and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
the whole Word
of God, and every part of it to
be true, but apply none of it to
themselves in particular, to
yeeld obedience thereto: and
this is grosse unbeleefe and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to condemnation. As
when men beleeve in generall
the doctrine of mans misery,
and acknowledge it true in
particular, but are not at all
humbled hereby, or driven out
of themselves: That know the
doctrine of salvation by Christ,
and of Gods readinesse to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
and save repentant sinners,
and his promises to shew mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to all that seeke it aright, yet


<pb n="404" facs="tcp:27910:209"/>
are not moved thereby to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
and seeke Christ with the
affection as they ought to doe</p>
            <p>So also when men beleev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

this or that duety in their own

            <p>This sinne of Vnbeleefe is
oft forbidden in Scripture, as
by our Saviour Christ to <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,
Iohn 20. 27. Be not faithlesse,
but beleeving. Heb. 3. 12. Take
heede brethren lest there bee in any

            </p>
            <p>So the people are oft re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached


<pb n="405" facs="tcp:27910:209"/>

They beleeved not his Word:</hi> and
our Saviour Christ doth of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke

<hi>Luke 24. 25. Oh fooles and slow

               </gap> aware of. Men thinke theft,
murther, drunkennesse to bee
hainous, and indeede so they
be; but unbeleefe is far worse:
for it is the mother of these
and all other evills.</p>
            <p>It was the first sinne that
crept into <hi>Eves</hi> heart, whereby
Satan prevailed over her when
she begunne to falter about the
Word of God, making a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure
and doubt of that
which God had peremptorily

is deeply rooted in our nature,
and is the mother of all our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

faith is of all obedience. Not

What sinne can you name that

was the cause of all the Israelite

disobedience, and persecuting
the truth, as wee see in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles

            <p>This sin is woefully rooted

workes, such as none
ever did; as casting out divells
by his word, stilling the Sea,
healing desperate and old
diseases by his sole word, yet
for all this and many other
cleere evidences of his divine
nature, they hated and persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him to death, as a Prince of
ill doers. Yea though the
Apostles by their joynt mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strie,


<pb n="410" facs="tcp:27910:212"/>
continued preaching of
Jesus, yet would they not bee
brought to beleeve in him;
though also they had seene no
small miracles at his death, as
the Sunne darkened, the vayle
rent, the graves opened, the

is not only in the wicked <hi>who

            <p>It is in vaine to serve God;
and what profit is it that wee

            <p>But there is also a root of it

            <p>Now the hainousnesse of this

in that it defiles both

            <p>In that also it is a sinne most

               <hi>Heb. 10. 38. But

Where more is meant than

of speech, as though hee
should say, I abhorre all those
that fall away through unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe.</p>
            <p>And this must needs be so; for
as faith giveth much glory to

as nothing but bubbles

            <p>Now if an honest man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
endure, to bee thought a

will he plead with such a one

            <p>Nay, if Russians themselves

            <p>How hainously will it bee

Mat.</hi> 5 18. whose word
is not only a word of truth,

it is that his servants have

            <p>Furthermore consider,<note place="margin">Punisht it.</note> that
God hath punisht this sinne
from time to time. As in the
old world fearefully, in <hi>Lots</hi>
two sonnes in law, the Jewes
in the Wildernesse, who all pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risht
through unbeliefe, only
<hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Ioshua</hi> came into Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,
who beleeved and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the Lord constantly; the
rest, as it is in the Hebrewes,
were shut out for their unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe.</p>
            <p>The lord also who would
not give credit to the word of
the Lord by the mouth of the

<pb n="414" facs="tcp:27910:214"/>
2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 7. 19. 20. also the
Iewes thirtie foure yeares af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
our Saviour CHRISTS
time, what dreadfull judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God by the Romans,
came upon them, as never was

they lye under the judgement
of God for the same till this
day. So the Iewes not belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the word of the Lord by
<hi>Ieremy, Ier.</hi> 44. 28. shall know
whether his word shall stand or
theirs.</p>
            <p>Yea God hath not spared it
in his owne servants, as <hi>Moses</hi>
and <hi>Aaron,</hi> who for their unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe
were debarred from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
into the land of promise,
<hi>Numb.</hi> 20. and <hi>Zacharie, Luk.</hi> 1.
was strucke dumbe because he
beleeved not Gods word. Yea
the Lord hath prepared a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
place hereafter for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleevers,
<hi>Revel.</hi> 21. 8. that is,
for those that sinne through to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
unbeleefe; for there is great


<pb n="415" facs="tcp:27910:214"/>
oddes betweene such, and those
that shewed unbeliefe in some
particulars. So that as this
sinne is odious and dishonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to God, so most hurtfull to
our selves. It hinders us from
many a comfort and blessing,
which we might else have in
this world. As our Saviour
Christ could not doe many
workes among some for their
unbeliefe sake, <hi>Marke</hi> 6. 5. And
our Saviour Christ telleth
<hi>Martha, Iohn</hi> 11. 40. that shee
had almost lost the sight of that
glorious worke of <hi>Lazarus</hi> his
raising, by her unbeliefe.</p>
            <p>Thus wee lose the fruite of
many a prayer through our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe;
for wee are bidden
when wee pray, to beleeve and
so we shall obtaine, <hi>Mark.</hi> 11.
And the Word becommeth
unprofitable if it bee not mixt
with Faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 2. and so
of the holy Sacrament.</p>
            <p>Yea it is damnable; for who


<pb n="416" facs="tcp:27910:215"/>
so beleeves not is condemned
already, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 18. and if yee
beleeve not that I am he (saith
Christ) you shall dye in your
sinnes, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 24. Much world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
griefe, distrustfull care, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
shifts, come from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleefe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
yea many make away
themselves hereby, as we see in
<hi>Iudas:</hi> and so many among our
selves being in debt, or feare
of shame or trouble, make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
themselves through their
unbeleefe; and this also is the
cause why most flinch in time
of persecution.</p>
            <p>This condemnes all these
sorts of unbeleefe,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> and the
whole world: for the whole
world lyeth in unbeleefe. First,
the Pagans are under a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of perishing; for igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
will not excuse them,
because God made man righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
at first, and is not now
bound to give them know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="417" facs="tcp:27910:215"/>
So that to them God hath
shewed severity, but to us
bountifulnesse, if we have grace
to make good use of his boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifulnesse,
else wee may make
our case seven times worse
than theirs. Our duety is to
pray unto God to send his
Word among them, that they
may come to the knowledge
of the truth, and so bee saved.
And a happy thing it were if
men would so doe, and use all
other good meanes to bring
any such to the saving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God and his truth. If
they had but halfe the minde to
it, that they have for backe and
belly, it would not bee hard to
effect it. But especially woe bee
to those that have meanes, and
yet bee ignorant. These love
darknesse more than light, and
so they heate the furnace seven
times hotter for themselves.
Many such doe swarme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us, who are ready to


<pb n="418" facs="tcp:27910:216"/>
excuse their ignorance by say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that they bee not booke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned,
and that they have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

their fond conceipts be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
excuses for them; but let
such know, that God will pull
off these figge leaves.</p>
            <p>2. This also condemnes
such as deny the truth of God
and the Gospell, even Iesus
Christ, as Turkes and Iewes
wholly, and Papists that doe
so in part. For such wee must
pray unto God that hee will
take the vaile from before their
eyes, and cause the light of his
truth to shine unto them, and
thank God for our selves, &amp;c.
And the like duety wee must
performe for all other Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes
and damnable unbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.
And so also we must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
unto God thankes and
praise for our selves, who hath
not onely caused the light of
his truth to shine unto us, but


<pb n="419" facs="tcp:27910:216"/>
also hath opened our eyes to
see and discerne it.</p>
            <p>3. It also condemnes the
third sort, which so swarme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
our selves, that there are
few others to be found. This
nation is an unbeleeving and
unfaithfull nation: for univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
though people acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the truth, both of Law
and Gospell, yet are they mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
with neither, nor driven
out of themselves, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
by the hearing the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of their misery, nor allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to seeke mercy as they
ought by the doctrine of the
Gospell. The threatnings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
sinne denounced never
so fearefully, yet keep them not
from their wicked wayes, nor
the promises made to godlines,
provoke and encourage them
to goodnesse. Who is moved at
any of these? but though they
know them, yet they doe as
they list. But let all such take


<pb n="420" facs="tcp:27910:217"/>
notice of the many threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
against sinne and wicked
waies in generall, <hi>Psal. 1. 6.
Psal. 9 &amp;</hi> 11. But alas, the
most men are so farre from lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
these threatnings to heart,
that notwithstanding they
have seene execution of these
threatnings upon others, yet
they dare live in the same sins.
As for example in the sinnes of
Sodome, which were punished
with fire and brimstone from
heaven. So of the people of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
for which they were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
into captivity, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30. 16.
So of our brethren of the Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinate
and Bohemia at this
time. Thus when God hath
threatned heavie judgements
against particular sinnes, yet
men are not moved thereby,
but securely and presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
continue in them: as the
threats against the breach of
the Sabbath, <hi>Exod. 34. Ierem.</hi> 17.
27. so against adultery, <hi>Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers


<pb n="421" facs="tcp:27910:217"/>
and Adulterers God will
judge, Heb.</hi> 13. 4. But alas, how
few are made to stand in awe,
and to keepe from these sinnes,
or are brought to repentance
for them, but runne on still as
the horse rusheth to the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell?</p>
            <p>So the promises made in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
to the wayes of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,<note place="margin">Deut. 29.</note>
as <hi>Psal. 128. 1. Psal,</hi> 112. 1.
and so to particular vertues, as
to Faith, Patience, Constancy,
to diligence in Prayer, to Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
to the poore, especially
the Saints, yet who are encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
hereby to the practice of
these vertues and Christian du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties?
No, notwithstanding we
have had meanes of Faith so
long, yet who will beleeve our
report? how few are brought
to true Faith in Christ Iesus?
notwithstanding that God
hath set seales to his Word by
mercies and punishments on
the Land. May we not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore


<pb n="422" facs="tcp:27910:218"/>
feare that some judgement
cannot be farre of, as that God
will snatch away his Word
and bestow it on some other
people which will bring forth
better fruits of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11 10.
For if God spared not his own
people in former times, how
can we hope that hee will spare
us? <hi>Deut.</hi> 32 20. If a man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to helpe us in time of our
danger, oh it comforts us
grealy: But Gods promises in
his Word give us not the like
contentment. If we have not
a pawne wee trust not God,
but are ready to fly out one
way or other. And for every
particular unbeleefe, let us la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to make all men see the
grossenesse of their sinne, that
trust God no further than they
see or feele him. Such sinne
more heinously than they bee
aware of, seeing no lesse than
condemnation is the end of all
unbeleevers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="423" facs="tcp:27910:218"/>
Let all men therefore be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
to labour to get this
bitter roote to bee stubb'd up,
and to be instant in prayer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God to doe it for us. For it
is God onely that must roote
it out, or else it will never bee
done. To which end let us
know that it were better that
ratts baine were in our belly
than this in our hearts. And
therefore let us shame our
selves for it, and strive against
it.</p>
            <p>First consider the heinous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the sinne, the disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to God, the hurt to our selves.</p>
            <p>Consider againe the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
and unchangeable truth
of God; and the experience
that others and wee our selves
have had of it. For if wee
looke into the holy Scriptures
wee shall finde that God hath
fulfilled his threatnings against
the wicked, and doth daily in


<pb n="424" facs="tcp:27910:219"/>
our times: and also his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
to his servants. Have not
the damned in hell and many
of our companions found God
to bee true in his threatnings,
and yet will not this make un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeve?
which of us but hath
found God just of his promise?
and more we should if we had
marked the same; yea let the
servants of God labour earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
against this; for oh what a
roote is in us still? alas how
poore is our faith? how great
is our unbeleefe? If trouble a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise
wee are dasht by and by; if
wee have meanes, oh how jolly
are wee? but if not, or weake,
then how soone are wee nipt in
the head? How weake are we
in the maine promise, and so in
the other? oh how it offends
God? oh how it hinders us? oh
what hurt comes of it even to
his best servants, who have
smarted for it! and how shall
wee doe for Faith enough to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide


<pb n="425" facs="tcp:27910:219"/>
the fiery tryall and dayes
of persecution?</p>
            <p>Now we are to consider also
of the other extreme,<note place="margin">Presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> Presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which shootes over as far
as the other comes short, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very bold and confident
where there is no ground or
promise.</p>
            <p>As when men presume, and
make themselves sure they shall
be saved, that if roome shall
want in heaven, the Prophets
and Martyrs must come out to
give them roome, and yet did
never looke one steppe towards
Faith, were never humbled,
lost, sicke, never felt hunger,
thirst, and never found will to
part with their lusts to buy the
pearle. Now howsoever God
hath made promise of mercy
to such, yet to no other; nay he
hath plainly spoken the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
namely, <hi>that hee came not to
call the righteous, but sinners to
repentance, Mat.</hi> 9. 13.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="426" facs="tcp:27910:220"/>
Againe, men are presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
when they are confident,
they shall be saved though they
live in some knowne sinne or
sinnes, and doe as others doe,
especially if they bee civill ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
men, though they have no
dram of religion in them to
God-ward, no knowledge,
faith, or saving grace, when as
God hath spoke no such thing,
nay the contrary, as 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 10.
Be not deceived, neither fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
nor Idolaters, nor adulterers,
nor effeminate, &amp;c. shall inherite
the kingdome of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So also when they thinke
that they shall doe well enough
though they walke after the
stubbornnesse of their owne
heart: As the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees,
who presumed that they
were in good estate, because
they had <hi>Abraham</hi> to their

therefore they which doe no


<pb n="428" facs="tcp:27910:221"/>
such thing have just cause ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to expect his wrath and
fearefull judgements. God said
to <hi>Abraham, Walke before me

then, <hi>I am God all-sufficient.</hi> And,
<hi>no good thing shall bee wanting to

1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 13. and yet none are
so confident for these things, as
they that have least right to
them.</p>
            <p>Also it is great presumption
when men are bold to commit
sinne, because God is mercifull,
and to put off their repentance,
because though their state bee
not good, yet it shall bee well
enough, and as well as the best
for God is mercifull, and they
will call to him for mercy, and


<pb n="429" facs="tcp:27910:221"/>
he will heare them whensoever
they call (from which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous

they shall be saved; is
there any almost make any
doubt but that all sorts, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
persons, civill persons, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
worldlings, hypocrites,
all shall be saved? And if any
in some places make doubt, it is
but a small number that have
least cause; but for the rest, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they are perswaded their
case is good already, or else at
least they can make it good
when they list, for when they
have but a minde to hold up
the finger, and call to God for
mercy, they are sure of it. So
that all bee assured. But upon


<pb n="432" facs="tcp:27910:223"/>
what acquaintance I pray you?
and where and what bee your
grounds? Nay then you must
pardon them, for either they
have none, or as good as none;
they hope God did not make
them to damne them; and that
they have not led their life so
ill to bee damned. Also they
are well thought of by their
neighbours; and they have
great crosses in this world, and
therefore they shall have joy in
another. Or else they are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to say contrariwise, that they
thrive in the world, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are beloved of God, seeing
hee bestoweth on them such
blessings. And I pray where
did God say these should be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that bee thus? They must
get to heaven by strong hand
whether God will or not, or
else come in and God not know
it; for none shall come there
with his good will, but such as
come according to his Word.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="433" facs="tcp:27910:223"/>
And whereas they say that
God is mercifull; It is true; but
yet let them know that some
have found him just too, and so
shall they also: for of all others,
presumptuous persons are the
furthest off.</p>
            <p>Also this Land is wonderfull
bold, and confident against all
enemies and dangers: Tush (say
the most) we have peace with
all Nations, and if wee should
have any enemies, yet we need
not to care for any, if wee bee
true within our selves. Also
God hath defended this Nation
these sixtie yeeres, as in eightie
eight, and at the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
in, and from the powder
treason, and so hee will doe still,
we have no feare.</p>
            <p>I acknowledge it to bee true,
that God had mercy on this
Nation formerly, when it had
lesse meanes, and more truth of
heart to profit by them:</p>
            <p>But doth that follow, because


<pb n="434" facs="tcp:27910:224"/>
he hath done so, therefore he will
do so still, especially now when
as the Nation growes worse &amp;
worse; for as the meanes and
mercies of God abound, so the
abominations of our Nation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
more and more: as hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
contempt of God and his
Word, prophanation of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
name, and Sabbaths, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse,
whoredome, oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
contempt of Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
hating the wayes of
God, and calling it Puritanisme
when men make conscience to
walke in them. Yet we thinke
our selves so happy as having
such a godly King, wise Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
learned Clergie, and safe
from all danger. And therefore
though God call to fasting, wee
fall to feasting, masking, playes,
wherein religion and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
thereof are gybed at and
derided. <hi>Isai.</hi> 22. 12. wee live
in the same sinnes that Sodome
was destroyed for, and yet


<pb n="435" facs="tcp:27910:224"/>
rest secure, and cry peace; and
in which the Iewes lived, and
for which they were carried
captive, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36. 16. and yet
we blesse our selves, as if wee
were in no danger: yea wee are
greater sinners than our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
in Germany, and yet
what desolations are sent upon
them? though we in the meane
time for the same and worse
sinnes are not moved to feare.
But like sinnes will bring like
punishments, <hi>Levit.</hi> 18. 28. And
therefore what can be expected
but Gods heavie punishments,
when as men are growne so
impudently prophane, as to
make playes against all that in
sincerity of heart make consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of serving God, under the
odious name of Puritans? and
when as others also take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in seeing and hearing
them.</p>
            <p>May wee not rather feare to
speed as <hi>Ioshua,</hi> and the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites


<pb n="436" facs="tcp:27910:225"/>
who when they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
Iericho, next morning
hast up to doe the like to Ai,
making no doubt of victory;
but when they came there,
they were put to flight before
their enemies, and thirty slaine,
to the great griefe of <hi>Ioshua</hi>
and the people. And why?
there was sinne among them,
that weakened and betrayed
them. So wee being like them
in respect both of their sinnes
and vaine confidence have just
cause to expect the like issue.
Or as <hi>Sampson</hi> who telling his
harlot, that if hee were thus
and thus bound, hee should bee
weake, and when the Philistims
came, hee rouzed up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
and brake all, contemning
all their power and attempts,
because hee knew his owne
great strength. But at last when
hee brake covenant with God,
and told her his strength was in
his vow to God of a Nazarite,


<pb n="437" facs="tcp:27910:225"/>
and if hee were shorne hee
should become as weake as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
man; then shee having
cut off his haire and brought
in the Philistims, he thought to
have got away as at other
times; but all in vaine: for now
his strength is gone, and hee so
faint, that hee falls into their
hands, and is constrained to
grinde without his eyes and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a scorne to all his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
whereas if he had beene
truer to God, hee would have
preserved him from all these
miseries.</p>
            <p>So when any danger comes
wee may thinke to scape, and
doe as before, but wee may hap
to be deceived. There is too
much sinne amongst us, and
breach of covenants with God,
that hee should defend and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
us as in times past. The
Lord awaken us, that wee may
see our sinnes, and labour to
prevent his judgements by


<pb n="438" facs="tcp:27910:226"/>
speedy repentance God calleth
us out of our sins, by his yeerly
afflictions, by the great troubles
of our brethren, &amp; wastings of
other Churches; to fasting and
prayer: but loe the contrary,
joy and gladnesse, slaying oxen,
and killing sheepe, eating flesh
and drinking wine, &amp;c. <hi>Isa.</hi> 22.
12.</p>
            <p>But let us take heed, that we
heare not the like doom from
God which hee denounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them: Surely this ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
shall not bee purged from
you till you dye, saith the Lord
of Hosts; So <hi>Isa.</hi> 28. 15.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, let us
take notice of divers other
parts of presumption, as to
thinke our selves happy, and
the Lords, when as wee never
looke one step towards Faith,
or to attaine any part in Christ;
to thinke we shall be saved, and
that wee bee good Christians,
though we live in some known
sin.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="439" facs="tcp:27910:226"/>
But thinkest thou indeede to
be saved? yea, art thou so sure of
it that none can put thee down?
and yet walkest thou after thine
owne hearts lusts? why know,
that the Lord who is truth it
selfe, hath said that <hi>he will not be
merciful to these men that shal bless
themselves in their heart, saying,
I shall have peace though I walke
in the imagination of my heart,
to adde drunkennesse to thirst: but
the anger of the Lord and his jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie
shall smoke against them, and
all the curses written in Gods booke
shall lye upon them, and the Lord
shall blot out their name from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
heaven, Deut.</hi> 29. 19. 20.</p>
            <p>Also do you live in sinne, and
deferre repentance, and thinke
to doe well enough, because
God is mercifull, when yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of your predecessours have
found and doe now in hell find
him a just God? Againe, dare
you presume that God will bee
at your call, whensoever you


<pb n="440" facs="tcp:27910:227"/>
hold up the finger, when as you
see that <hi>Esau</hi> and the foolish
virgins found it contrary; yea
when as you heare God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
professing, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 24. 28.
that he <hi>will laugh at their destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
who have not hearkned
to his voice, calling them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance:
and that shall bee the
help they shall have in the time
of their neede. Thou that rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>konest
without thy host must
reckon twice, and once in hell
as it is to bee feared, if thou
thou changest not thy course.
No, Friend, no: If such as thou
art bee saved, God must make
new Seriptures first, which hee
will not doe to pleasure thee.
How dare any presume to live
in many sinnes, and yet hope?
when as they see how God cast
out the Angells from heaven
into utter chaines for one fault;
so <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> out of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise
for one sinne; and so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
corrected <hi>Moses</hi> and


<pb n="441" facs="tcp:27910:227"/>
               <hi>Aaron</hi> for one faile at Meribah.
Nay our Saviour Christ found
him a just God, when he stood
as our surety. Thou preparest
a backe way, and makest gates
of thine own to heaven, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misest
great matters to thy
selfe, but God never said any
such thing: Oh vaine Foole!
And thou lookest for great
things from God which be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
in his Word, but never
lookest to the conditions to be
fulfilled on thy part: as if a man
should occupy a mans land and
take all the profits, and never
thinke of paying any rent; but
such are worthy to bee turned
out to lye in the streetes. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
know, that many dye
upon presumption to one of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speration;
Also that it is great
madnesse to presume they can
repent when they list; and
therefore put it off, when they
bee called unto it, seeing
the Scripture telleth us that we


<pb n="442" facs="tcp:27910:228"/>
be dead in sinne, and that wee
cannot thinke a good thought:
and surely it is to be feared, that
God will not give them repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
at last, that have despised
it all their lives.</p>
            <p>There are thousands that
make no doubt when they live,
and at their death, but that they
shall goe to heaven, who yet
are no sooner dead, but the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
takes possession of their
soules. But because there is
some seeming similitude be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
Faith and this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption,
I will set downe some
differences betweene the one
and the other: for they differ
as much as a rotten post guilded
over, doth from a thing of mus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
sie and pure gold.</p>
            <p>1. Faith hath a ground
from the Word of God, and
beleeves because God speakes;
presumption hath no such
ground, but onely selfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
the pride of his owne


<pb n="443" facs="tcp:27910:228"/>
heart, which makes him thinke
that, that is not, and because he
hath got such a thing in his
head; and therefore hee is as a
man that dreames that hee ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
and when hee awaketh is
still an hungered.</p>
            <p>2. Faith proceedeth from
knowledge going before; for a
man cannot beleeve what hee
knoweth not: but presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is joyned with ignorance
oftentimes, and the more igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
the more bold, according
to the old Proverbe, None so
bold as blinde bayard. For if
they knew the law of God, the
nature of God and themselves,
they could not be so bold.</p>
            <p>3. Faith proceedeth from
some measure of true humi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>liation,
and from seeing
and feeling his owne mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
estate. Presumption
knoweth no humiliation, but
proceedeth from a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
of their owne righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse,


<pb n="444" facs="tcp:27910:229"/>
as the Pharisee, and
the yongue man in the Gospell,
Laodicea, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>4. Faith is gotten with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty,
and by many steppes it is
come unto. Presumption is bred
with a man, and it never cost
him any labour in seeking, stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
hearing, prayer, confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
but comes at ease, and
at once. And yet if presumption
be any Faith (as they that have
it conceit it is) it is a very
strong Faith; for it is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident,
and yet got at once and
at ease: the which is proofe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
against it; for base things
grow apace, but things of
worth more slowly. Presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
like <hi>Ionahs</hi> gourd comes up
in a night: Ill weeds grow with
speed.</p>
            <p>5. Faith is joyned with
doubting both in the working
of it, and after: for the flesh
lusteth against the Spirit, and
there is a continuall combate


<pb n="445" facs="tcp:27910:229"/>
betweene them in the beleever
and the regenerate man, and
the devill opposeth the Faith
of such a one; therefore they
are not soone settled, but are
like a man cast into the sea, who
swimming towards a rocke is
beate backe oft with waves.
Presumption never had any
doubting, they never doubted
of Gods good will in their
lives, they thanke God, and
would be loth now to beginne;
yea they wonder at a number of
fooles that cannot beleeve, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there are many who are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
troubled with any doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
nor know not what they
meane. But let such know to
their small comfort that the
reason hereof is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the
strength of their Faith, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
being wholly carnall,
corruption fights not against
corruption, and because the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
is no enemy to presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but helpeth it forward, <hi>Vide

Negus, cap.</hi> 17.<note place="margin">Act. 15.</note>
            </p>
            <p>6. Faith purifieth the heart &amp;
reformeth the life,<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 22.</note> abandoning
the love of al &amp; every sin;<note place="margin">1. Tim. 1. 5</note> for it
beleeveth and applyeth Christ,
not onely for justification and
Redemption, but for Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
also. A theefe desires on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a pardon for his faults, but
not for good lawes for better
ordering of his life. So a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous
person desires to
have the pardon of sinne, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any desire to leave and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
it. The presumptuous man
hath a corrupt heart, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penteth
of no sinne, though it
refraine from some; some it
lives in, what it likes best;
some in the second Table, but
many shamefully cold &amp; care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
in the first. Faith as it
looketh for, and challengeth
mercy from God, so it is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to returne thankefulnesse
and obedience to him againe:
but presumption lookes for all


<pb n="447" facs="tcp:27910:230"/>
from God, but never thinketh
of keeping conditions on his
part. As Faith applies Christ to
it selfe, so it giveth himselfe to
Christ againe: but the presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
or temporary doe not so.
As <hi>Herod</hi> gave himselfe not to
Christ, but to <hi>Herodias; Iudas</hi>
not to Christ, but to the bagge,
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>7. Faith goeth like a Lady
attended with a long traine of
vertues, as love to God, to
men, especially the Saints, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
temperance, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Presumption goeth like a
ragamuffian without any such
companion; for you shall see
divers of these that shew ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
true love to God nor men,
especially the Saints, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
more than any other.</p>
            <p>8. Faith feeling it selfe
weake, and much opposed by
unbeleefe, and set upon by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,
is carefull to cling to the
meanes of the Word, Prayer,


<pb n="448" facs="tcp:27910:231"/>
Sacrament, that it may get
more strength and increase.
But Presumption cares little for
the meanes: a sermon or none,
one or two, all is one, and the
Sacrament only at Easter, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecteth
the repetition of the
sermons, or prayer, yea it
thinketh on no such matter,
nay the lesse the better, yea e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
it never useth any stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
or searching meanes, but
the lesse they use such meanes,
the stronger is their perswasion,
howsoever sometimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to the meanes, they have
a little unsettled and disturbed
their thoughts. Faith is the
stronger for means: presumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
is the stronger for want of the
true means indeed, not using a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more than their own devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and blinde superstition.</p>
            <p>9. Faith abideth even in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
in sicknesse, trouble,
losse of friends, goods, and
health, &amp;c. for it seeth God still


<pb n="449" facs="tcp:27910:231"/>
as a mercifull father, even when
he frownes, and can kisse his
afflicting hand. Also it holdeth
up its head in some measure
(though not without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts)
in times of persecutions
and oppositions. But Presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
faileth at such times, and
one pricke of a pinne will let
out this blowne bladder. It is
nipt in the head in time of
trouble, and becommeth like a
stone as <hi>Nabal,</hi> or sometimes
being awaked out of his false
confidence, it falleth into the
contrary extreme, even to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire:
As <hi>Iob</hi> saith, <hi>Will hee call
upon God at all times</hi> so say I, <hi>Will
hee beleeve at all times?</hi> And in
time of persecution his great
brags come to nothing, but
turns plaine craven, as we see in
<hi>Peter</hi> for a season. Though all
men deny thee, yet will not I: I
will go to prison and dye with
thee, &amp;c. yet see what it came
to: But prevailingly &amp; deadly,


<pb n="450" facs="tcp:27910:232"/>
see it in Doctor <hi>Pendletons</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.<note place="margin">Act. &amp; Mon.</note>
Faith makes no hast
out of trouble by any unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
meanes: presumption ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
not much how nor by
what meanes deliverance
comes, so they bee out of their
trouble.</p>
            <p>By these let every one of us
trie our selves, that true belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
may receive comfort; and
those that presume may bee
humbled in the want of true
faith, to wit, such as are bold,
without ground, get it at ease,
and shew no fruits, would have
all from God, but returne no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to him againe in token of
thankfulnesse. It is presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the divell and your selves,
who have beguiled you. If you
looke not better to it, and get
a better foundation, your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceites
like a Castle of come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>downes
will lie in your necke,
and presse you to hell.</p>
            <p>And because thou presumest


<pb n="451" facs="tcp:27910:232"/>
upon mercy by late repentance,
and crying, Lord have mercy
upon me, know, that thousands
bee now in hell for this tricke:
for though God hath promised
mercy to the humble, yet not
to the presumptuous; and that
many such as presume have not
had so much time, or if they
had, yet God hath pronounced
that not every one that saith,
<hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> shall bee accepted of
him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 22.</p>

Then wee shall bee ever with the

            </p>
            <p>There be generall promises
to all that feare God, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
promises to some kindes
of persons, as to them that suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
persecution for righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
sake,<hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 11. to the
orphanes, widowes, strangers.
There bee absolute promises,
and promises conditionall.
Conditionall bee the promises
of things temporall, which
God will fulfill to his children,
as shall stand with his glory


<pb n="460" facs="tcp:27910:237"/>
and their best good. Absolute
promises are they of things spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
and eternall, to wit, that
hee will not faile to give so
much grace to his, as shall bee
sufficient for their salvation,
and at last eternall life.</p>
            <p>Also there be direct promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
in the Scripture, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
by consequent. The direct
we have heard, as that which
was made to <hi>Abraham</hi> of a
sonne, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. also to <hi>Paul,</hi> that
not one in the ship should lose
his life, <hi>Act.</hi> 27. By consequent,
as thus. If we finde any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
made to one godly man in
Scripture, and no speciall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
expressed why it should be
peculiar to him, then wee may
take it as a promise made to us,
as being also the children of
God. Thus the Apostle, <hi>Heb.</hi>
13.5. disswading from covete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
useth a reason from a
promise which was made to
<hi>Ioshua, I will not faile thee;</hi> but


<pb n="461" facs="tcp:27910:237"/>
yet pertaines to all Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>2. Whensoever we see that
any of Gods people have pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for any good things, and
beene heard, if it were not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to them, we may take it
as a promise to us, and looke
for the sames as <hi>David Psal.</hi> 22.
4. encourageth himselfe to
speede, <hi>Our fathers trusted in
thee, and thou didst deliver them,
they trusted in thee, and were not
confounded, they praied to thee, and
were delivered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. Whensoever wee see
God hath done any thing for
his children (which was not
peculiar) we should expect that
hee will doe the like to us; for
God loveth all his children, and
<hi>whatsoever is written, is written
for our learning, Rom.</hi> 15. 4. Thus
Saint <hi>Iames</hi> exhorting to pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in trouble, useth <hi>Iobs</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
<note place="margin">Iam. 5. 11.</note> 
               <hi>Ye have heard of the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of Iob, and have seene


<pb n="462" facs="tcp:27910:238"/>
the end of the Lord,</hi> meaning
that wee shall have such an end
too, if wee be patient as hee
was.</p>
            <p>Now then God having
made such excellent and sweet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
promises of all kindes, our part
is to beleeve and apply them to
ourselves, and they shall bee
fulfilled to our comfort.</p>
            <p>And thus are wee to doe for
our spirituall or temporall life,
and also for our eternall. For
our spirituall life, for our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
our sanctification, and
perseverance therein, and the
meanes thereof; for in all these
stands our spirituall life, and
wee have promises of every of
these, which if we beleeve, wee
shall have a spirituall and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
life.</p>
            <p>As first for my salvation;
When I beleeve still, and every
day hold fast this, that I am the
Lords (so I awake as the Lords
to day as well as yesterday, and


<pb n="463" facs="tcp:27910:238"/>
so lye downe at night, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that once the Lords and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Lords, and <hi>that whom
be loveth, bee loveth them to the
end)</hi> therefore (I say) I hold
fast (by leading a godly life, and
renewing my repentance and
my covenant with God) the
perswasion that I am still the
Lords, as he hath before recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
me to mercy, and his mind
varieth and changeth not. This
is to live by faith in one part,
and what a comfort is this still
to hold fast my faith? And that
not onely when I feele the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of God, but when all
seemes contrary, yet then to
beleeve still, is to live by faith;
so that whatsoever temptation
of Sathan, or my owne unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe,
or want of feeling com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
in the way, yet to hold
out this shield of faith to
quench the fiery darts of all
Sathans temptations, this is to
live by faith.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="464" facs="tcp:27910:239"/>
So in the matter of my san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification
I have great use of
my faith, to further me therein,
both for the avoiding of evill
and doing good. For I must
doe this or that duety, because
I know its the will of God, and
not do the contrary, because its
forbidden, not for this or that
sinister reason.</p>
            <p>First for the resisting of evill,
as mine owne strong corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
these must be mastered: but
how? I must resist and strive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them: but when as I may
thinke and feele I shall never
prevaile over them, then I must
live by faith, grounded on Gods
promises, as, God <hi>hath said
his grace shall bee sufficient.</hi> And
this with such promises will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
us to set against them,
when by faith we beleeve that
God hath promised, and will
help us, and blesse our labours;
or else wee shall resist with no
courage. So againe wee must


<pb n="465" facs="tcp:27910:239"/>
resist the devill. Yea but what
likelihood is there that wee
should prevaile, he being as hee
is, and wee as wee bee? Hath
God made no promise to helpe
in this case? Yes, hee hath said,
<hi>Resist the devill and hee shall flye
from you, Iam.</hi> 4. 7. So for the
world (which wee have to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose)
God hath told us, that
<hi>greater who that is in us, than hee
that is in the world,</hi> 1. Io. 44 Now
we resisting thus by faith in as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
of victory, shall fight
the more comfortably: so that
if the flesh object and say. I
know not how I can scape be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
carried away of the world;
the answer hereunto is, <hi>Live
by faith.</hi> So for doing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
good; God calleth for
many dueties at our hands: as
from the Magistrate, Minister,
Householder; how shall we do
these duties, seeing we have no
power? <hi>live by faith:</hi> for hath not
God said, feare not, <hi>I will be with


<pb n="466" facs="tcp:27910:240"/>
thee,</hi> as to <hi>Moses, Exod.</hi> 3. and 4.
so to <hi>Ieremy, cap.</hi> 1. Say not I am
a childe, for thou shalt goe to
all that I shall send thee.</p>
            <p>So that here is use of our faith,
to encourage us to goe about a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
duty God calleth for of us;
seeing hee will enable us to it.</p>
            <p>So to the duty of merciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
or any such, God hath
promised <hi>not to forget our labour
of love, which wee have shewed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his name, in that wee have
ministred to the Saints, and doe
minister;</hi> but will reward the
same both in this world and the
world to come, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 6.</p>
            <p>So for defending the truth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
cavillers, or before Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers.
Alas I cannot tell what to
say, I shall shame all. Feare not
but <hi>live by faith.</hi> God hath said,
<hi>it shall bee given thee in that same
houre what thou shalt speake,
Math. 20. 19. and, I will give,
thee a mouth and wisedome, which
all your adversaries shall not bee


<pb n="467" facs="tcp:27910:240"/>
able to gainesay or resist, Luk.</hi> 21.
15. But I may be called to suffer
persecution ere I dye, and alas
I feele no fitnesse nor ability to
endure the fiery tryall. Well,
care not for to morrow; doe
the present duties which God
requireth, and spend thy time
well, and then leave that to
God, and live by faith: he will
give us strength whose power is
perfected in our weaknesse.</p>
            <p>So for perseverance in our
Christian course, how shall we
doe this, we see no strength in
our selves nor likelihood that
wee shall hold out, but have
cause rather to feare the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary;
for there are so many
adversaries which daily op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
us, that they may hinder
us in our course?</p>
            <p>And againe such grievous sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
long paine, and trouble, as
I may easily sinke or be impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.
Care not for hereafter,
which is a sinne as well in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall


<pb n="498" facs="tcp:27910:241"/>
as temporall things, but
let us commend our selves to
God, assuring our selves that he
who hath begun his good
worke will finish it.</p>
            <p>So for the means of grace, as u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the Word, Sacrament, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
meditation, conference, here
is great use of faith; for what
heart can we have to use these
meanes, but when wee by faith
use them, beleeving that God
will blesse them to us, for right
ends and encrease of his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces?
for he that blesseth mens-outward
labours, will not bee
wanting to our spirituall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours.
This heartens us to
take paines in them, yea when
wee have felt no benefit by
them for a time, yet to, beleeve
and waite, and use them still:
So that though Sathan per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
us to forbeare them, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Thou gettest no good by
them, but rather aggravates thy
sinne, and increasest thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.


<pb n="469" facs="tcp:27910:241"/>
Well, yet I will
use them, seeing God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to be with them that use
them carefully. If I goe by Sea
or Land in great danger, oh
what shall I doe? <hi>live by faith</hi>
in Gods promise of protection,
in all thy wayes, as <hi>Ezra</hi> 8. 25.
and 31. compared: so <hi>Iacob</hi>
when hee heard that <hi>Esau</hi> was
comming against him; prayed,
beleeved, and went on.</p>
            <p>For our temporall life, here
is also great use of faith: daily
it is requisite, that every one
have a Calling, in which to live
and serve Gods providence for
his maintenance. Now it is
requisite first, that wee be sure
that our Calling be a lawfull
Calling.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that it bee our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and not anothers into
which wee have intruded our
selves; for then if it bee an
unlawfull calling or not our
calling, we can looke for no


<pb n="470" facs="tcp:27910:242"/>
blessing. But if wee have our
calling from God, and walke in
it with a good conscience, then
may we first assure our selves
of Gods protection, who will
care for us himselfe, and hath
given his Angels charge to
keepe us in all our wayes, and
therefore may bee comforted
whether wee be at home or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
on horsebacke or on
foot: in respect of our selves,
night and day that God will
watch over us, and no ill shall
fall out; and for our change
also and family in our absence,
so long as we are called by God
to be from them, as the Lord
promised, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34 23. 24.</p>
            <p>So for successe in our lawfull
businesses, when we have used
the meanes, and commended
the same to God by prayer, wee
should live by faith, and take
no carking care for the event,
for this is to overload our
selves needlesly and vainely;


<pb n="471" facs="tcp:27910:242"/>
and it is Gods part, which
wee ought not to incroach up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but leave it to the ordering
and disposing of his wise pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
and being assured that
hee will giue that successe that
shall be best, wee should rest in
this, and quiet our selves.</p>
            <p>So when we are about a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
wee should use the best
and wisest lawfull meanes wee
can, and then commit it to
God, and so bee at rest, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voide
those scornes that the
world pull upon themselves,
pining themselves with care,
and casting in their heads, and
breaking their sleepe: Oh but
how if I should not have this
bargaine, if any should come
betweene <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e and home; if the
party should not bee at home
when I send, or will not stand
to his word? how if this and
that should come betweene and
hinder my bargaine? So for
time to come, wee must leave


<pb n="472" facs="tcp:27910:243"/>
that to God, fayling of no law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
meanes, but yet using them
without any carking care. How
shall I doe if I should bee lame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
when I am old, or when my
lease is out? live by faith, and
God will provide against all
these doubts and difficulties.</p>
            <p>So for our children; how shall
my children doe for mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance?
let us goe as farre as we
can, and leave the rest to God
who is all-sufficient to provide
for them, and to perfect all that
wherein we are defective. A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

this we shall finde to be a great
quietnesse to our mindes. So
when crosses come, there is
great use of our faith. The Lord
hath thus disposed of it, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e will
turne all to good, and lay no
more upon me than he will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
mee to beare, and make a
good end in his due time. And
so whether we have meanes or
none, little or great, yet let us
live by faith, having the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise


<pb n="473" facs="tcp:27910:243"/>
of a strong, mercifull, and
just God, and not limit the
Lord for the time of our deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance,
nor for the meanes
whereby wee shall bee delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
but leave it to him, depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
upon him, who hath said
hee will not faile nor forsake
any of his, &amp; if they call on him
in their trouble, he will deliver
them. And so bee patient and
waite without discomfort or
breaking out into murmuring
and impatiency; yea still waite,
though helpe come not by and
by, and so soone as thou expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctest
and desirest. So also in
respect of our eternall life, wee
must live by Faith, namely, that
wee shall one day come to it,
and herewith encourage our
selves in our painefull labours,
and all the crosses of this life,
knowing and beleeving that
heaven will pay for all, and that
our momentary and light affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
shall bee abundantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compensed


<pb n="474" facs="tcp:27910:244"/>
by that eternall
weight of glory which they
cause unto us.</p>
            <p>In the end of our life wee
have also neede of Faith to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
our selves of a happy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,
and bee bold to let our
soules goe, knowing (though
devills swarme in the aire like
flies) yet the holy Angells shall
carry up our soules into the
joyes of heaven; and also wee
may commit comfortably our
miserable body to the grave, in
assured hope of a glorious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
unto glory and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednesse,
and so of eternall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse
with God both in soule
and body for ever.</p>
            <p>This living by faith God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth,
and bids us we should
put our faith to use; as <hi>Ephes. 6.
16.</hi> we are commanded to take
it to us as a shield, so that wee
should not onely have it to bee
saved by, but daily and hourely
to use it, and live by it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="475" facs="tcp:27910:244"/>
Thus have the holy servants
of God done in all ages, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
after God had made him a
beleever, is called out of his
country from house and home,
and kindred, to goe whither
God should shew him, but hee
knew not whither; so that as
blind folkes follow their guide,
so hee followed God and lived
by faith.</p>
            <p>So it was promised him that
in his seede should all the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the earth bee blessed, and
yet hee had no childe, nor no
likelihood of any; hee being
old, and his wife also old, and
barren at best, yet hee beleeved
and waited upon God for the
accomplishment of his promise,
and consulted not with reason,
but cast himselfe wholly upon
Gods word and promise, and
at last had <hi>Isaac.</hi> And when hee
had him, in time hee is bidden
to goe and offer him up to God,
notwithstanding this crosse


<pb n="476" facs="tcp:27910:245"/>
(the Messias being to come of
his seede) crost his salvation,
and of all the world: and yet
he obeyed, and for the promise
let the Lord alone for that;
knowing that hee that made it
was able to keepe it, and to
breake it his truth would not
suffer him. Being asked, here i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
the wood, but where is the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice?
he answered that God
would provide one; Oh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakeable
Faith. <hi>Noah</hi> also
lived by faith, as wee see in his
story, both in making the Arke,
and getting in of the creatures:
he disputed not how shall wee
ever bee preserved in this
stinch of the creatures of the
Arke? nor what should become
of them when all were drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
hee made no such questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but did all in Faith, went
in and continued there by
Faith, and came out by Gods
appointment.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Isaac</hi> lived by Faith, wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing


<pb n="477" facs="tcp:27910:245"/>
for the promise of a seede,
in whom all Nations should be
blessed; the which came not of
twenty yeares after, and yet he
waited, not changing his wife,
nor taking any other, but relied
upon God by faith in the use of
lawfull meanes. And so belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
hee conveyed the blessing
to his posterity by Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iacob</hi> did so in all his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
in going downe to Meso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potamia,
in returning when hee
heard of <hi>Esaus</hi> comming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him with foure hundred
men. For then did hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and strengthen himselfe by
grounding his faith upon Gods
promise; <hi>O Lord, thou that
saiest returne into thy country, and
to thy kinred, and I will deale well
with the, deliver mee I pray thee
from the hand of my brother;</hi> and
so using the meanes, hee went
o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>. But how should he scape
his fingers? God promised to
doe him good, that is enough
for him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="478" facs="tcp:27910:246"/>
And thus hee gave comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
to be buried in Canaan
in token of his Faith, beleeving
that his posterity should inherit
that land.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Ioseph</hi> gave commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his bones, and <hi>Moses,
Heb. 11. 25. 26. David</hi> likewise
notably lived by Faith, in all
his troubles, as it is to bee seene
in his Psalmes; in greatest dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
commending himselfe to
God, and refusing to helpe
himselfe unlawfully by hurting
<hi>Saul,</hi> because God had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
him the Kingdome: <hi>Though
an hoast</hi> (saith hee) <hi>pitched a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
me, yet mine heart shall not
feare, Psal.</hi> 27. So <hi>Psal.</hi> 23. 4. Not
but that sometimes his Faith
was shaken a little (for neither
he nor the rest had beene men if
they had been perfect) but they
recovered it againe, and lived
by Faith.</p>
            <p>So hee did notably discover
his living by Faith, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. 6.


<pb n="479" facs="tcp:27910:246"/>
For when the Philistines had
burnt Ziklag, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ready to stone him, it is said
that hee <hi>comforted himselfe in the
Lord his God,</hi> and said, <hi>Into thy
hands I commed my spirit: thou
hast redeemed mee O Lord God of
truth, Psal.</hi> 31. 5.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Nehemiah, cap. 1.</hi> when he
heard of the misery of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
fell to prayer, clinging to a
promise that he knew made by
God, that hee had read and
markt out of Deutronomie: and
so in other things.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Ezra</hi> would not aske the
King a guard to go with them,
though the way were full of
danger, but committed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
and his company by Faith
to Gods keeping.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Mordecai</hi> discovered his
Faith in his speech sent to <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
Hest.</hi> 4. 14. namely, that if
she failed to speake to the
king in the behalfe of her nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
God would send delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance


<pb n="480" facs="tcp:27910:247"/>
to his Church some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way. Some other way?
which way trow you did hee
see? nay that he could not tell:
Indeede if shee had used her
best skill, it had beene much to
expect a recalling of such a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,
and there had beene use
of Faith. But though she should
faile, yet to beleeve God would
helpe some other way, this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued
a great Faith. And why
was hee so confident? because
he knew they were the Church
of God; and therefore that
they could not be cut off.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Ester</hi> her selfe being thus
urged, used the meanes, and
said, If I die, I die, I will doe it
by the helpe of God; a worthy
Faith, as we would easily see if
wee knew and weighed well
her case. Such a Faith was in
<hi>Iob,</hi> that said, <hi>If God killed him he
would put his trust in him, Iob</hi> 13.
15. Thus also <hi>Paul</hi> lived by
Faith, both for spirituall life,


<pb n="481" facs="tcp:27910:247"/>
               <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. and for temporall life,
2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 17. 18. and for eternal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
life, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 7. 8.</p>
            <p>So the Martyrs, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
by their couragious and
faithful speeches in extremities
of danger: As, that if God sent
no meate, hee would send no
hunger: That their enemies
could do no more than God
would suffer them; and that
either God would abate the
force of the fire, or else in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
their strength. As also
wee see this in their faithfull
commending their soules into
the hand of God: <hi>Lord Iesus,
receive my spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So many godly Saints in our
times have shewed their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
by their comfortable
speeches both in life and death.</p>
            <p>For our further provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
hereto,<note place="margin">Reason.</note> understand some
reasons. It is a great glory to
God that we live by Faith: For
then wee make him a God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>indeed,


<pb n="482" facs="tcp:27910:248"/>
when wee trust him on
his bare word against reason,
and when wee see nothing to
perswade us, but rather the
contrary. Then wee make him
our God, when wee so put our
confidence in him, and in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie
and adversity, when we
have meanes or no meanes, for
our soules, bodyes, for us our
selves, and for our friends and
family, for this and the other
life.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Ioseph</hi> tooke this most
kindely of his Master, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed
it the greatest benefit
that he could have bestowed
on him, that hee trusted him
with all hee had, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39. 8. so
God takes it well at our hands
when wee trust him on his
word, seeing it is a putting to
our seale unto it; though herein
wee should doe no more than
there is wonderfull cause wee
should, yet we are weake to doe
it: Lord increase our faith, and


<pb n="483" facs="tcp:27910:248"/>
pardon our unbeleefe. And
therefore God hath recorded
the examples of beleevers, as
taking such pleasure in them
as he would not have them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,
and for our learning.
The contrary, how dishonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
is it to God the faithfull
and true witnesse!</p>
            <p>2. It is a wonderfull bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
to our selves, and maketh
our life sweet; For it freeth us
from much heart-griefe, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
care and sorrow, &amp; much
unprofitable trouble we put our
selves to; as might easily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,
if wee should examine
particulars. And what a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
every of these is to beleeve
them: As first for our spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
life, daily to hold fast the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
of the favour of God.</p>
            <p>Also in the matter of sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
what a heartening is
this to resist evill, and to doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
good duty, when we beleeve
God will be with us, in the one


<pb n="484" facs="tcp:27910:249"/>
and the other, to give us helpe
against our corruptions, or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans
temptations, and to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
us to any duty he calleth us
to. So what a comfort to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
our perseverance, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
wee thinke of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,
and the worlds power
and our weaknesse, and whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
wee heare of the falls of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ones, who seemed of fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
greater strength than we.</p>
            <p>So what an encouragement
is this to the Word, Sacrament,
Prayer, when wee beleeve wee
shall get good by them? So for
our temporall life, looke over
the particulars of that.</p>
            <p>And for our eternall life,
what a comfort is it that when
our troubles be many and great
yet wee may ease our selves, by
considering of the blessed en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
of all, when wee shall enjoy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting
rest with God in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?
So in our death, when w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
can boldly commend our selves<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>


               <pb n="485" facs="tcp:27910:249"/>
our soules and bodies unto God
as unto a faithfull Saviour, who
will safely keepe them to the
last day, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 12. On the
contrary side, what a miserable
thing it is not to have use of
our faith in these things? As,
for our spirituall life to be ever
and anon doubting wee are not
the Lords, what a life is this?
what heart can wee have to
strive against our corruptions,
or Sathans temptations, when
wee feare wee shall never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile
over them? So that wee
shall never hold out, but lose all
at the end, especially if persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
should come.</p>
            <p>So for duties to bee perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
which (for want of faith)
wee sometimes omit, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
our selves from such du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
as wee be called to, or doe
them untowardly. So what
heart can wee have to the
meanes, when we doubt wee
shall get no good by them?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="486" facs="tcp:27910:250"/>
So for our temporall life,
what a miserie is it to bee ever
in feare, to goe out in feare, and
be abroad with a distrustfull
fearing minde?</p>
            <p>So when wee have used the
meanes and prayed, yet to bee
distracted with care, breake
our sleepe, lye tossing, and
so waste our bodyes with
griefe, and make our selves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
for other good duties. If
we had the greatest thing in
the world in hand, when wee
had used the meanes once, wee
should lay our heads downe in
Gods lappe, as quiet as if wee
had nothing to doe: but alas, if
we have but a small thing in
hand, we so trouble our selves,
as wee be unfit for holy dutyes,
and all for want of more faith.</p>
            <p>So in troubles, what a misery
is it to be weake in faith then?
For wee hereby fall to impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
on the one side, or on the
other to be strucke like a stone,


<pb n="487" facs="tcp:27910:250"/>
or ready to use unlawfull
meanes, when wee cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
that God will blesse those
that are lawfull.</p>
            <p>So for time to come, what a
misery is it to bee alwayes in
suspence, and doubtfull of the
issue of all our labours?</p>
            <p>So for our children, when we
cannot beleeve that hee who is
our God will also bee the God
of our seed, and will take care
to provide for them, when both
we and all our meanes faile.</p>
            <p>So for our eternall life, what
a pitifull thing is this, and what
wrong to our selves, when wee
are weake and wavering about
that in our great troubles, and
in the end of our life, when
we are going hence?</p>
            <p>3. Hereby our faith shall be
greatly encreased, for, use faith
&amp; have faith, as they say of legs
and of memory: whereas the
not setting it on worke is a
cause it is so weake.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="488" facs="tcp:27910:251"/>
4. Thus shall the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
be accomplished, and wee
get many good things at the
hand of God, and else not, so
that wee misse many a good
turne by our unbeleefe.</p>
            <p>Now if all this bee so,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> then
must wee needes acknowledge
that most men be in an ill case;
for few will bee found to live
by Faith.</p>
            <p>First, for the most part they
have no Faith; and therefore
they cannot live by Faith. Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,
prophane, civill world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
these are quite without
Faith, and some that make bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
shew, that yet fall short of
true Faith.</p>
            <p>They live by other rules;<note place="margin">False rules.</note> as
first, by carnall and naturall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
thinking if they follow
their calling, and pay every man
his owne, and live orderly, and
keep their Church, that God
will hold them excused, if
there be somewhat amisse, and


<pb n="489" facs="tcp:27910:251"/>
they shall be both blest and doe
well here, and be saved hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or else God helpe. If such
should not do well who are not
borne againe, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 3. our
whole nature being so vile, as
we must not be restrained only,
but universally changed anew,
theirs were very strickt: but this
is a false rule; for our Saviour
Christ told the Scribes &amp; Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees,
that they should not enter
into the Kingdome of heaven,
nor any other, except their
righteousnesse exceeded theirs.</p>
            <p>The yongue man in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell
had done thus at the
height, yet there was somewhat
wanting to bring him to the
Kingdome of heaven, to wit, to
sell all and follow Christ, which
he could not do without Faith.
Many among the Heathens,
their Philosophers and wise
men among them especially,
went thus farre, and yet came
short.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="490" facs="tcp:27910:252"/>
2. Also they live by sense
only, and not by Faith; as farre
as they see, they will beleeve,
but no further. If they have
meanes, then they are jolly, if
not, then dead, and shift as they
can.</p>
            <p>If God promise to a duety
done a reward of blessing, if
God stoppe into their hand
and give them a pawne, they
will beleeve, but if it be but his
bare word, (as to give all to the
poore) they dare not take that.
Yet if a rich man come to them
for forty or a hundred pound,
and tell them they shall have
it with increase at the quarters
end, they will let him have it
cheerfully, and trust him: If he
say, you shall have a pawne al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
if you please for better secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
No, saith hee, I will trust
you for more than that: if I
have but your word or have it
under your hand for mortality
sake, it is sufficient. But yet


<pb n="491" facs="tcp:27910:252"/>
they will not give to the poor,
which is to lend to the Lord,
though hee promise to repay it
with advantage; yea though
hee have given it under his
hand. <hi>Esau</hi> lived by sense, choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the pottage before the
birth-right. <hi>Moses</hi> lived by
faith, choosing rather to be in
adversity with Gods people
under the hope and promise
of deliverance out of Egypt,
than to live still in <hi>Pharaohs</hi>
Court, and there for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to enjoy the pleasures of
sinne, and preferments of the
world.</p>
            <p>If they commit their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to a rich man who is
their friend, oh they are very
glad, but not so confident and
comfortable to commit them
to God. If a great man promise
to deliver them out of a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
they are quiet &amp; secure, but
though the Lord promise so,
they are not comforted. Now


<pb n="492" facs="tcp:27910:253"/>
all this is because they live by
sense, and what they see they
beleeve, and not by faith in
God, whom they see not: and
therefore they will not beleeve
him. If they have wealth to
leave their children they are
comforted, if not, they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust
Gods promise, &amp; choose
rather to get riches by deceit,
than to rest upon his word in
the use of just and true dealing.</p>
            <p>So they live in that course
of life that is most plausible in
the world, and not in that
whereto God hath made his
promise, as <hi>Moses</hi> did. In time
of persecution they take the
easiest way, and thinke them
fooles that lose here, in hope
of future gaine.</p>
            <p>3. They live by presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
making no question but
that their state is good, and
that God will not suffer them
to want, and that hee will save
them at their death, when hee


<pb n="493" facs="tcp:27910:253"/>
never said any such thing, nor
they bee the partyes to whom
his promises are made. Or
else if their case be not present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
good, yet they can call to
God for mercy, and then all
shall bee well. What a saucie
boldnesse is this to challenge
great things of God, which he
never promised, to reape where
he never sowed? As if one
should come to a man and aske
him twenty pound, saying, I
know you will give mee it;
Why, (will he say) did I ever
promise you? if I did, I will be
as good as my word, if not, thou
art a bold fellow, in presuming
to obtaine so groundlesse a
suit.</p>
            <p>4. Also they live after their
owne lusts, every one as their
heart leads them, either whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
or in part, not crossing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
of their will. It is for
their profit, their pleasure, their
minde, and therefore they will


<pb n="494" facs="tcp:27910:254"/>
doe it; If they bee in danger
they will helpe themselves
with a lye, a false oath, going
to a Witch, and thinke it folly
if they should not. These bee
false and wicked rules, which
make ill worke, and lead men
to destruction.</p>
            <p>Now if all this bee so, then
how much may we bewaile the
estate of the most that live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us, in that, that after
such meanes of faith, so few
will bee found true beleevers.
For take out the five sorts that
be here mentioned, who are no
true beleevers, and how many
will be left? But let us know
their misery that are without
true faith, and what punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
remaine for such among
us as live and die without it.</p>
            <p>And therefore Ministers are
to be exhorted to preach Faith
more carefully, and the people
to labour for this above all, and
to know by what steps they


<pb n="495" facs="tcp:27910:254"/>
may come unto it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it serveth also to
rebuke the servants of God,
and such as have faith, that yet
have little use or benefit of it,
but live too much by sense (as
was said before and as might
plainly appeare if wee should
examine the particulars,)
whereby they dishonour God,
and draw out an uncomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
life full of misery often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times.</p>
            <p>Oh what a happy life might
we lead, if wee had this grace
of faith? For what is it that
makes us miserable at any
time? our crosses, troubles?
No, but this, that wee cannot
depend upon God in these ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
for then we should be quiet,
The servants of God have been
cheerefull in great troubles, as
<hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silus</hi> in the prison and
stocks at midnight, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.
The Martyrs cheerefull in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
at the stake, in the fire, and


<pb n="496" facs="tcp:27910:255"/>
have clapt their hands over
their heads, to expresse the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
joy of their hearts. But
wee dishonour God and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet
our selves. And this is the
reason, because our faith is no
stronger, and we make so little
use of it. And this is the cause
that we misse many a good
thing wee might have from
God, if we did beleeve.</p>
            <p>3. It serveth likewise for
instruction, that seeing there is
such a comfortable life to bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
that wee would labour to
grow better acquainted with it.</p>
            <p>And to this end first, to know
the promises of God scattered
in his Word, and that wee ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
them together; and get
them written out, especially
such as most concerne us. If
we have an hearbe in our gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
that would case our griefe,
and wee know it not, what are
wee the neerer? And so if we
know not the promises, though


<pb n="497" facs="tcp:27910:255"/>
they be in the booke, what are
wee the better? If wee be to
seeke when wee have need of
them, wee may doe ill, though
wee have them in our booke;
for though sometimes God
helpes his servants, that when
they know not a promise, as
soone as they in their trouble
open the booke, they light up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a most fit place; yet this not
to be trusted to.</p>
            <p>2. Wee should remember
them, and by Faith meditate
on them, and apply them to
our selves, and leane upon them
as upon a rocke, fearing more
that the earth should reele from
you, and give you a fall, then
the promises should faile you.</p>
            <p>If wee had a most soveraigne
medicine or cordiall, but
have quite forgot where wee
have laid it, it will little availe
us when wee stand in need to
have it presently applyed: and so
it is in this case, seeing it is not</p>
