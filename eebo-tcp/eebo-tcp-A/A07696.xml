            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And yet of those that will not, are there also two sortes. For fyrst one sort there are, that are so drowned in sorowe, that they fall into a careles deadlye dulnes.</p>
               <p>Regarding nothing, thinking almoste of nothyng, no more than if they laye in a letarge, with whiche it may so fall, that witte and remembraunce will weare away, and fall euen fayre from them. And this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortles kinde of heauines in tribulacion, is the hygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est kinde of the deadlye sinne of slothe. An other sorte are there, that will seke for no comforte, nor yet none receiue, but are in their tribulacion (be it losse or sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes) so testie, so fumishe, and so farre oute of all paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that it boteth no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to speake to them, and these are in a maner with impacie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, as furious as though they were in halfe a frenesie, and may with a custome of such facioned behauiour, fall in therto ful &amp; whole. And thys kinde of heauines in tribulacion, is euen a mischieuous high braunche of the mortal sinne of yre.</p>
               <p>Than is there as I tolde you, an other kynde of folke, which faine woulde be comforted, and yet are
<pb facs="tcp:13201:12"/>
they of two sortes to.

               <p>So surely if we custome our selfe to put our trust of coumfort in the delyte of these pieuishe worldelye thinges God shal for that foule fault suffre our tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacion to growe so great, that all the pleasures of this worlde shall neuer beare vs vp, but all oure pieuishe pleasure shal in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> depth of tribulacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> drown with vs.</p>
               <p>The other sorte is I saye, of those that long and desyre to bee coumforted of GOD. And as I tolde you beefore, they haue an vndoubted greate cause of coumforte, euen in that poynte alone, that they considre themselfe to desyre and longe to bee by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myghtye God coumforted: Thys mynde of theyrs may wel be cause of great comfort vnto them for two great consideracions. The one is, that they see them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe seeke for their coumfort where they cannot fayle to finde it. For God both can geue them comfort, and wil. He can for he is almightie: he wil, for he is al good<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:13201:12"/>
cause to be of good comfort, as I say, in that he cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth that he longeth to be comforted by hym, which his faith maketh him sure, wil not fayle to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort him.</p>
               <p>But here considre this that I speake here of hym that in tribulacion longeth to bee comforted by God: and it is he that referreth the maner of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortyng to God, holding himselfe content, whether it be by the taking away or the minyshment of the tribulacion it self, or by the geuing him pacience and spiritual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solacion therein. For of hym that onelye longeth to haue god take his trouble from him, we cannot so wel warrant that minde for a cause of so greate comfort. For both may he desyre that, that neuer mindeth to be the better, &amp; may misse also the effect of his desyre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his request is happely not good for himself. And of this kind of longing &amp; requiring, we shal haue oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> farther to speake herafter. But he which refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the maner of his comforte vnto God, desireth of god to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forted asketh a thing so lawfull &amp; so plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant vnto god, that he cannot fayle to spede, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath he (as I saye) great cause to take comfort in the very desyre it selfe.</p>
               <p>An other cause hath he to take of that desire, a very great occasion of comfort. For sith his desyre is good, and declareth vnto himself that he hath in god a good faith: it is a good token vnto him y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he is not an abiect cast out of gods gracious fauour while he perceiueth y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> god hath put such a verteous well ordred appetite in his mind. For as euery euil mind cometh of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worlde and our selfe, and the Deuill: so is euerye such good mynde eyther immediately, or by the meane of oure good Aungell or other gracious occasyon, inspyred into mannes hearte by the goodnes of God hymselfe.
<pb facs="tcp:13201:13"/>
And what a comfort than may this be vnto vs, whan we by that desyre perceyue a sure vndoubted token, that toward our final saluacion our Sauiour is him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe so graciously busy about vs?</p>

And that is one of the causes for whiche God sendeth it vnto man. For albeit that payn was ordeyned of God for the punyshmente of synnes (for whiche they that neuer can nowe but sinne, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be but euer punished in hell) yet in thys worlde, in whiche his high mercy geueth men space to be better, the punyshmente by tribulacion that he sendeth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Sainct Paule was himselfe sore agaynst Chryst, tyll Christ gaue him a great fall and threw him to the ground, and strake him starke blynde: and with that tribulacion he turned to him at the fyrst woorde, and God was his phisicion, and healed hym soone after both in body and soule by his Minister Ananias, and
<pb facs="tcp:13201:13"/>
made him his blessed Apostle. Some are in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of tribulacion verye stubborne and stiffe against god, and yet at length tribulacion bringeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> home. The proude King Pharao dyd abyde and endure two or thre of the first plages, and would not once s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>oupe at the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But then god layd on a sorer lashe that made him crye to him for helpe, and then sente he for Moyses and Aaron, and confessed him selfe a synner, and god for good and righteous, and praid the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to praie for him, and to withdrawe that plage, and he would let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> go. But when his tribulacion was withdrawen, than was he naught agayne. So was his tribulacion occasion of his profyt, and his helpe againe cause of his harme. For his tribulacion made him cal to god, and his helpe made hard hys heart againe. Many a man that in an easy tribulacion falleth to seke his ease in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pastime of worldly fantasyes, fyndeth in a greater paine al those comfortes so feble, that he is faine to fall to the seking of goddes helpe. And therefore is I saye, the very tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulacion it selfe many tymes, a meane to bringe the man to the takyng of the afore remembred comforte therin: that is to witte, to the desyer of comfort geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by god, which desyre of goddes comfort is as I haue proued you, greate cause of comforte it selfe.</p>

This man maketh muche of me now, and geueth me money also to faste and watche &amp; praye for him: but so I feare me would he doe no more if I should goe tell him nowe that all that I doe for hym will not serue him but if he goe faste and watche and praie for himselfe to.

Iob was also no beggar perdye, nor no wretche other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, nor lost his riches &amp; hys welth, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God woulde not that his frend should haue welth but for the shewe of hys pacyence to thencrease of hys meryte and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of the deuil, and for proofe that prosperitie may stand wyth gods fauour, <hi>Reddidit deus Iob omnia duplicia.</hi> God restored him double of all that euer he loste, and gaue hym after long lyfe to take hys pleasure long.</p>

Nowe had god shewed him before by Samuel that he should come to nought, and he wente aboute none amendement, but waxed worse and worse, so that god lust not to looke to him: and when he soughte by the Prophetes to haue answere of god, there came none a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>swere to him, which thing he thoughte straunge: and because he was not with god heard at his pleasure, he made suite to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deuil, desiring a woman by witchecrafte to rayse vp dead Samuel: but spede had he such therof, as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly they haue al y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in their busines medle with such matters. For an euil aunswere had he, &amp; an euil spede therafter, his army discomfited and him selfe slayne. And as it is rehearsed in Paralipomenon the .x. Chapter of the first boke.

And on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther syde, bothe in tribulacion and prosperitie too, some manne maye also doe verye well, and deserue thanke of god by thankes geuen to god, as well of hys gyfte of ryches, woorship and wealthe, as of nede and penu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye priesonmente, sickenes and payne, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you cannot see, for what cause I shoulde geue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye preheminence in coumforte vnto tribulacion, but rather allowe prosperitie for the thyng more coumfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and that not a litle, but in maner by double, syth therein hath the soule coumforte and the bodye both:
<pb facs="tcp:13201:40"/>
the soule by thanke (for his gyft) geuen vnto god, And then the bodye by being well at ease, where the parson payned in tribulacion, taketh no coumforte but in hys soule alone. Fyrst as for youre double coumforte Cosyn, you maye cutte of the one. For a manne in prosperitie, though he bee bounden to thanke God of hys gyfte, wherein he feeleth ease, and maye bee glad also that he geueth thanke to GOD: yet for that he taketh hys ease here, hath he little cause of coum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte, excepte that the sensuall feeling of bodelye plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, you lust to call by the name of coumforte. Nor I saye not naye, but that some tyme menne vse so to take it, when they saye, this good drynke coumforteth well my heart.</p>
                  <p>But coumforte Cosyn, is properlye taken, by them that take it ryghte, rather for the consolacion of good hope that men take in theyr heart, of some good grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing toward the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then for a present pleasure, with which the body is delyted and tickeled for the whyle.</p>
                  <p>Now though a man without pacience can haue no reward for his pain, yet when his payn is paciently ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for gods sake, and his will co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formed to gods plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure therin, god rewardeth the sufferer after the rate of his payn, &amp; thys thing appeareth by manye a place in scripture, of whiche some haue I shewed you, and yet shall I shewe you moe. But neuer founde I anye place in scripture that I remembre, in whiche though thys welthy man thanked god for hys gyft, our lorde promised any reward in heauen, because the man toke hys ease and pleasure here. And therfore, sith I speake but of such coumforte as is very coumfort in dede, by which a man hath hope of Goddes fauour, and remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of his sinnes, with minishyng of hys paynes in

purgatory, or reward els in heauen. And such comfort cometh of tribulacion, and for tribulacion well taken, but not for pleasure though it be well taken: therefore of your cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort that you double by prosperitie, you may as I told you cut very wel away the halfe.

spirituall or ment of some small moderate refreshing of the minde, against an heauy discomfortable dulnes. Nowe whereas prosperitie was to the chyldren of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell promised in the olde law: as a special gyft of god, that was for theyr imperfeccion at that tyme to draw them to god, with gaye thinges and pleasaunte, as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to make chyldren learne, geue them cake bread &amp; but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For as the scripture maketh mencion, that people wer much after the maner of chyldren in lacke of wit, &amp; in waiwardnes. And therfore was their master Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses called <hi>Pedagogus,</hi> that is, a teacher of children, (or as they call such one in the grammer schooles) an vsher, or a maister of the petites. For as Sainct Paul sayth. <hi>Nihil ad perfectum duxit lex.</hi> The old lawe broughte nothyng to perfeccion. And god also threatneth folke with try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulacion in this worlde for synne, not for that worldly tribulacion is euyl, but for that we should be wel ware of the sickenesse of synne, for feare of that thynge to folowe, whiche though it be in dede a very good whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some thyng yf we wyll take it, is yet beecause it is paynefull, the thyng that we be lothe to haue.</p>

and betwene labour &amp; rest, the reason goeth all alyke: whiche whoso canne consider, shall see that for the porcion in euery godd dede done by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> welthy man, the matter is al one. Than sith we haue somewhat wayed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vertues of prosperitie, let vs co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other side the afore named thinges y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are the matter of merite &amp; reward in tribulacion, that is to wit, pacience confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie and thankes.

For if he be pinched in any pointe wherin he taketh pacience, in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> part he suffreth some tribulacion, and so not by his prosperitie, but by his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulacion hath the manne that merite. Lyke is it if we would say, that the welthye man hath a nother vertue in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> stede of pacience, that is to wit, the kepyng of hym self from pride, and from such other sinnes as wealthe would bring him too. For the resisting such mocions, is as I before told you without ani doubt, a minishing of fleshly welth, and is a veri true kind, and one of the most profitable kyndes of tribulacion, so that al y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> good merite groweth to the welthy man, not by his wealth, but by the minishyng of his wealthe with wholesome tribulacion. The moste couloure of comparison is in the other twayne: that is to witte, in the conformitie of mans wyll vnto god, and in thankes geuen vnto god. For lyke as the good man in tribulacion sent hym by god, conformeth his wyll in that behalfe, and geueth god thanke therfore, so doth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> welthy man in his welth whiche god geueth hym, conforme his wyll to goddes wyll in that poynte: sith he is well contente to take it of his gyfte, and geueth god agayne also right hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye thanke therefore.

tribulacion. But yet that they be not matches, you maye soone see by thys. For in trybulacion can there none conforme his will vnto goddes, and geue hym thanke therefore, but suche a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as hath in that point a very special good mynd. But he that is very nought, or hath in his hearte but very litle good, maye well be content to take welth at goddes hande, and say, mary I thanke you sir for this with all my hearte, and wyll not fayle to loue you well while you lette me fare no worse. <hi>Confitebitur tibi, quum benefeceris ei.</hi> Nowe if the welthy man be verye good, yet in conformitie of his will and thankes geuen to god for his welth, his vertue is not like yet to hys that doeth thesame in tribulacion: for as the philosophers sayd in that thing very wel of olde, vertue standeth in thinges of hardenes and difficulty. And than as I tolde you, much lesse hardnes and lesse difficulty there is by a great deale to be contente and conforme our wyll to goddes wil, &amp; to geue hym thanke too for our ease, than for oure payne: for oure welth, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for oure woe.

<pb facs="tcp:13201:65"/>
The Foxe asked the Asse before he beganne <hi>Benedicite.</hi> wherefore he came to confession so soone before lente began. The poore beast answered hm againe: for feare of deadly sinne, and for feare he shoulde lese his part of any of those prayers that the priest in the clensinge dayes prayeth, for them that are confessed alreadye. Than in his shryfte he had a meruelous great grudge in his inwarde conscyence, that he had one daye geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hys maister a cause of angre, in that, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> with hys rude roaring before hys maister arose, he had awaked hym out of hys slepe, and bereued hym of his reste.

                  <p>But his wise wyly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fessor accoumpted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for trifles, as they were in dede, and sware afterwarde vnto the bageard that he was so weary to syt so long and heare him, that sauing for the maner sake, he had leuer haue sytten all the whyle at breakefaste wyth a good fatte goose. But when it came to the penaunce geuing, the foxe found that the most waighty sinne in al his shrift, was glotonye, and therefore he discretly gaue hym in penaunce, that he shoulde neuer for gredines of hys owne meate doe anye other beast anye harme or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deraunce, and then eate hys meate, and studye for no more.</p>
                  <p>Nowe, as good mother Maude tolde vs, when the Woulfe came to confession to father Raynarde
<pb facs="tcp:13201:65"/>
(for that was, she said, the foxes name) vpon good fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daye, his confessor shooke his greate payer of beades vpon him, almoste as bigge as bowles, and asked hym wherefore he came so late? Forsoth father Raynarde quod the woulfe, I muste nedes tell you the truth, I come you wote well therefore, I durst come no sooner for feare lest you woulde for my glotonye haue geuen me in penaunce to fast some parte of thys lent. Naye naye, quod father foxe, I am not so vnreasonable, for I fast none of it my selfe. For I may say to the sonne betweene vs twayne here in confession, it is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of god this fasting, but an inuencion of man. The priestes make folke faste and put them to payne aboute the moone shyne in the water, and doe but make folke fooles, but they shal make me no such foole I warraunte thee sonne. For I eate fleshe all this lent my self I: howebeit, because I wil not be in dede occasion of slaunder, I therefore eate it secretlye in my cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber out of sight of al such foolishe brethren, as for theyr weake scrupulous conscience would waxe offended wythall, and so woulde I counsayle you to doe. Forsoth father Foxe quod the woulfe, and so I thanke god I doe as nere as I can, for when I goe to my meate, I take none other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany wyth me, but such sure brethren as are of my owne nature, whose co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sciences are not weake I warraunt you, but theyr stomake as strong as myne. Wel tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, no force quod father foxe. But when he heard after by hys confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was so great a rauenor y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he deuoured &amp; spent somtyme so muche vytaile at one meale, as the pryce therof woulde finde some poore man wyth hys wyfe and his children almost al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wieke, than he prudently reproued y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> poynte in hym, and preached hm a processe

And I doubte not but you haue hearde of manye by ryght ante<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiue stories, that (some for one cause, some for

And therfore as I say, we may see that the affeccion of the mynde to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde the encrease or decrease of the dreade, maketh muche of the matter. Now are the affeccions of mens myndes imprinted by diuerse meanes: One waye, by the bodely sences moued by suche thinges pleasant or dyspleasant, as are outwardly thorow sencible world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thinges offered and abiected vnto them. And thys maner of receyuyng the impressyon of affeccions, is common vnto menne and beastes. Another maner of receiuing affeccions, is by the meane of reason, which<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And those reasonable disposicions been affeccions spirituall and proper to the nature of man, and aboue the nature of beastes. Now as our gostly enemy the deuil enforceth hymselfe to make vs leane to the sensuall affeccions and beastly: so doth almightye God of hys goodnes by hys holye spirite inspire vs good mocions, with ayde and helpe of hys grace towarde the tother affeccions spirituall, and by soondrye meanes instructeth oure reason to leane vnto them, and not onelye to receyue them as engendred and planted in our soule, but also in suche wyse water them with wyse aduertisement of godly counsayle and continuall prayer, that they maye be habitually radycate, &amp; surely take depe roote there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and after as the tone kynde of affeccion or the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beareth the strength in our heart, so be we stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or febler agaynst the terror of death in thys cause.
