            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE LIFE OF Fracastorius.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>FRacastorius</hi> was descended from the <hi>Fracastorian</hi> Family of great Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity in <hi>Verona.</hi> He seemed not onely to rival the Fame of <hi>Catullus</hi> and <hi>Pliny,</hi> who had long before made that City renown'd, but to have very far exceeded all his Contemporaries, for Learning and Poetry. His Parents were <hi>Paulo-Philippus Fracastorius</hi> and <hi>Camilla Mascarellia,</hi> both of great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. He was so well educated
<pb facs="tcp:40932:5"/>
by his Father that he gave early proofs of a great Genius, so that in his child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood all men conceived hopes of an extraordinary Man. Nor was Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence wanting to give him a signal Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony, forasmuch as when he was an Infant in the Armes of his Mother, a sudden Tempest arising, in which the Mother was struck dead by Lightning, the Child received no harm. He was sent for literature while very young to <hi>Padua,</hi> where even in that age with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable labour, he opened his way to that height of glory which he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards attained: After the initiatory Arts he applyed himself to the secrets of distinct Sciences, but infinitely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with the Mathematicks, in all, assisted by a Memory equal to his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity. After several years spent in Philosophical studies under the Tutor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of <hi>Peter Pomponatius</hi> of <hi>Mantua</hi>; he devoted himself by the dictates of his Genius to Physick with such resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:40932:5"/>
and success, that in the School disputations, not onely his fellow Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents but most experienc'd Doctours were sensible that he was designed by Providence for great Undertakings. Accordingly they then gave him the honour of the Pulpit, which had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver before been permitted to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son till they had perfected their studies, and were arrived to the years of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. This School being dissolv'd by the breaking out of the War, while he had thoughts of returning to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey (his Father being then dead) he was on honourable conditions invited by <hi>Livianus,</hi> General of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Forces, and a noble Patron of Wit, to the College <hi>Forojuliensis,</hi> &amp;c.—and lodged in the same apartment of <hi>Andrea Naugerus</hi> and <hi>Iohannes Cottac,</hi> two excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Poets. He had not long resided here before he published Verses on every ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Occasion that happened, which were received with such general
<pb facs="tcp:40932:6"/>
applause throughout <hi>Italy,</hi> that their fame has to this day stifled the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances of his Companions. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving after wards accompanied <hi>Livianus</hi> through many wars, the General being at last overthrown and taken Prisoner by the <hi>French</hi> at <hi>Abdua</hi>; he returned late into his native countrey, where in the general devastation he found his Patrimony almost utterly destroyed.</p>
            <p>He marry'd, but was soon unhappy in the loss of two Sons whose untimely death he bewailed in a most passionate Elegy. He was low of Stature but of good bulk, his Shoulders broad, his Hair black and long, his Face round, his Eyes black, his Nose short and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning upwards by his continual contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of the Stars, a lively air was spread over his Countenance that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played the Serenity and Ingenuity of his Mind. He affected a quiet and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate life, as being a man free from am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious desires; contenting himself
<pb facs="tcp:40932:6"/>
with a moderate fortune, and placing his happiness in improvement of his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. He was chearfull though fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal at his Table, having a constant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to his health; his wit being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the best part of his Banquet. He was notwithstanding sparing in his Speech, and affecting no vanity in his Dress: He was never censorious of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens performances, but always glad of an occasion to commend; for which he was deservedly celebrated by <hi>Iohannes Baptista</hi> in a noble Epigram. He spent his time in curing the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eased, a divine Power seeming always to attend his endeavours, above the sordid desire of gain, and thought himself best rewarded in the health of his Patient. By these means he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted many friendships, and had (de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly) no Enemy.</p>
            <p>He was not onely esteemed for his skill in his own countrey, but was sought to by foreign Princes in despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb facs="tcp:40932:7"/>
sickness, for which though vast rewards were offered, he brought no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing home beside their Friendship.</p>
            <p>In his leisure he diverted himself with reading History, at which time <hi>Polybius,</hi> or <hi>Plutarch</hi> were never out of his hands. He sometimes relieved his studies with Mathematicks and Musick, and made no small performances in Cosmogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy. He was much alone, yet always employed; and though by reason of his backwardness to discourse, he seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of a Saturnine Temper, yet none were more chearfull and pleasant when entred into Conversation. He perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med wonders by his exact knowledge of Herbs and Simples, by searching the best Books of the Ancients. That most excellent Antidote called <hi>Diascordium,</hi> was of his preparing; we are likewise beholding to his judgment for speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying many usefull Herbs of which the Ancients had left uncertain description. The Age in which he lived saw nothing
<pb facs="tcp:40932:7"/>
equal to his Learning, but his honesty. In his retreat from the City, while the Pestilence raged, he found leisure to compose the following Poem, a work of such elegance, that <hi>Sanazarius</hi> free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledged it to excell his own, <hi>De partu Virginis,</hi> that had cost him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove twenty years labour and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. His Treatises in Prose and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of Poetry are too numerous to be recited on this occasion.</p>
            <p>In all which he affected so little vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that he never preserv'd a Copy; and we are beholding for what are extant, to the industry of his Friends that col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected them after his death.</p>
            <p>He was above 70 years old when he dyed, which was by an Apoplexy that seiz'd him while he was at Dinner at his Countrey seat. He was sensible of his malady, though speechless, often putting his Hand upon the top of his Head, by which sign he would have had his Servants administer a Cupping-Glass
<pb facs="tcp:40932:8"/>
to the part affected, by which he had formerly cured a Nun in <hi>Verona,</hi> labouring under the same Distemper. But his Domesticks not conceiving his meaning apply'd first one thing and then another, till in the Evening he gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Expired. He was Interr'd at <hi>Verona</hi>: his Statue together with that of <hi>Andrea Naugerus,</hi> delicately cast in Brass, was erected in the School of <hi>Padua</hi> by <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hannes Baptista Rhamnusius.</hi> His fellow Citizens of <hi>Verona,</hi> not to be behind <hi>Rhamnusius</hi> in respect (two years after the erecting the brazen Statue in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dua</hi>) set up his Image in marble at <hi>Verona,</hi> in imitation of their Ancestours who had performed the same honour to their <hi>Catullus</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi>; with Laurel round their Heads.</p>

            <l>And streight was seconded by all the Throng.</l>
            <l>Both Swine and Heifers now by thousands bleed,</l>
            <l>And Natives on their roasted Entrails feed.</l>
            <l>Our Train with wonder saw these Rites, but more</l>
            <l>Astonisht at the Plague unseen before:</l>
            <l>Mean while our Leader in his carefull breast,</l>
            <l>Form'd sad Conjectures of this dreadfull Pest,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:40932:46"/>This, this said he (the Gods avert our Fate)</l>
            <l>Is that dire Curse which <hi>Phoebus</hi> did relate;</l>
            <l>The Birds prodigious Song I now recall,</l>
            <l>The strange Disease that on our Troops shou'd fall.</l>
            <l>As therefore from the Altar they retir'd,</l>
            <l>Our Gen'ral of the Native Prince enquir'd,</l>
            <l>To what dread Power these Off'rings did belong?</l>
            <l>What meant that languishing infected Throng?</l>
            <l>And why the Shepherd by the Altar stood?</l>
            <l>And wherefore Sprinkled with the gushing bloud?</l>
            <l>To which the Island Monarch, noble Guest,</l>
            <l>With annual Zeal these Off'rings are addrest,</l>
            <l>To <hi>Phoebus</hi> enrag'd Deity assign'd,</l>
            <l>And by our Ancestours of old enjoin'd;</l>
            <l>But if a foreign Nations toils to learn,</l>
            <l>And less refin'd be worth your least concern,</l>
            <l>If you have any Sense of Strangers fate,</l>
            <l>From its first source the Story I'll relate:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:40932:47"/>Perhaps you may have heard of <hi>Atlas</hi> name,</l>
            <l>From whom in long descent great Nations came;</l>
            <l>From him we sprang, and once a happy Race,</l>
            <l>Belov'd of Heav'n while Piety had place,</l>
            <l>While to the Gods our Ancestours did Pray,</l>
            <l>And gratefull Off'rings on their Altars lay.</l>
            <l>But when the Powers to be despis'd began,</l>
            <l>When to leud Luxury our Nation ran;</l>
            <l>Who can express the Mis'ries that ensu'd,</l>
            <l>And Plagues with each returning Day renew'd?</l>
            <l>Then fair <hi>Atlantia</hi> once an Isle of fame,</l>
            <l>(That from the mighty <hi>Atlas</hi> took its Name,</l>
            <l>Who there had govern'd long with upright Sway)</l>
            <l>Was gorg'd intire, and swallowed by the Sea.</l>
            <l>With which our Flocks and Herds were wholly drown'd,</l>
            <l>Not one preserv'd or ever after found.</l>
            <l>Since when outlandish Cattle here are slain,</l>
            <l>And Bulls of foreign Breed our Altars stain;</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:40932:47"/>In that dire Season this Disease was bred,</l>
            <l>That thus o'er all our tortur'd Limbs is spread:</l>
            <l>Most universal from it Birth it grew,</l>
            <l>And none have since escap'd or very few;</l>
            <l>Sent from above to scourge that vicious Age,</l>
            <l>And chiefly by incens'd <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Rage,</l>
            <l>For which these annual Rites were first ordain'd,</l>
            <l>Whereof this firm Tradition is retain'd.</l>
            <l>A Shepherd once (distrust not ancient Fame)</l>
            <l>Possest these Downs, and <hi>Syphilus</hi> his Name.</l>
            <l>A thousand Heifers in these Vales he fed,</l>
            <l>A thousand Ews to those fair Rivers led:</l>
            <l>For King <hi>Alcithous</hi> he rais'd this Stock,</l>
            <l>And shaded in the Covert of a Rock,</l>
            <l>For now 'twas <hi>Solstice,</hi> and the <hi>Syrian</hi> Star</l>
            <l>Increast the Heat and shot his Beams afar;</l>
            <l>The Fields were burnt to ashes, and the Swain</l>
            <l>Repair'd for shade to thickest Woods in vain,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:40932:48"/>No Wind to fan the scorching Air was found,</l>
            <l>No nightly Dew refresht the thirsty Ground:</l>
            <l>This Drought our <hi>Syphilus</hi> beheld with pain,</l>
            <l>Nor could the suff'rings of his Flock sustain,</l>
            <l>But to the Noon-day Sun with up-cast Eyes,</l>
            <l>In rage threw these reproaching Blasphemies,</l>
            <l>Is it for this O <hi>Sol,</hi> that thou art styl'd</l>
            <l>Our God and Parent? how are we beguil'd</l>
            <l>Dull Bigots to pay Homage to thy Name?</l>
            <l>And with rich Spices <unclear>feed</unclear> thy Altar's flame:</l>
            <l>Why do we yearly Rites for thee prepare,</l>
            <l>Who tak'st of our affairs so little Care?</l>
            <l>At least thou might'st between the Rabble Kine</l>
            <l>Distinguish, and these royal Herds of Mine.</l>
            <l>These to the great <hi>Alcithous</hi> belong,</l>
            <l>Nor ought to perish with the Vulgar throng.</l>
            <l>Or shall I rather think your Deity</l>
            <l>With envious Eyes our thriving Stock did see?</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:40932:48"/>I grant you had sufficient cause indeed,</l>
            <l>A thousand Heifers of the snowy Breed,</l>
            <l>A thousand Ews of mine these Downs did feed;</l>
            <l>Whilst one Etherial Bull was all your stock,</l>
            <l>One Ram, and to preserve this mighty Flock,</l>
            <l>You must forsooth your <hi>Syrian</hi> Dog maintain,</l>
            <l>Why do I worship then a Pow'r so Vain?</l>
            <l>Henceforth I to <hi>Alcithous</hi> will bring</l>
            <l>My Off'rings and Adore my greater King,</l>
            <l>Who do's such spacious Tracts of Land possess,</l>
            <l>And whose vast Pow'r the conquer'd Seas confess.</l>
            <l>Him I'll invoke my Suff'rings to redress.</l>
            <l>Hee'll streight command the cooling Winds to blow,</l>
            <l>Refreshing Show'rs on Trees and Herbs bestow,</l>
            <l>Nor suffer Thirst, both Flock and Swain to kill:</l>
            <l>He said, and forthwith on a neighbouring Hill</l>
            <l>Erects an Altar to his Monarch's name,</l>
            <l>The Swains from far bring Incense to the Flame;</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:40932:49"/>At length to greater Victims they proceed,</l>
            <l>Till Swine and Heifers too by hundreds Bleed,</l>
            <l>On whose half roasted Flesh the impious Wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches feed.</l>
            <l>All quarters soon were fill'd with the Report,</l>
            <l>That ceas'd not till it reacht the Monarch's Court;</l>
            <l>Th' aspiring Prince with Godlike Rites o'er joy'd,</l>
            <l>Commands all Altars else to be destroy'd,</l>
            <l>Proclaims Himself in Earth's low sphere to be</l>
            <l>The onely and sufficient Deity;</l>
            <l>That Heav'nly Pow'rs liv'd too remote and high,</l>
            <l>And had enough to do to Rule the Sky.</l>
            <l>Th' all-seeing Sun no longer could sustain</l>
            <l>These practices, but with enrag'd Disdain</l>
            <l>Darts forth such pestilent malignant Beams,</l>
            <l>As shed Infection on Air, Earth and Streams;</l>
            <l>From whence this Malady its birth receiv'd,</l>
            <l>And first th' offending <hi>Syphilus</hi> was griev'd,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:40932:49"/>Who rais'd forbidden Altars on the Hill,</l>
            <l>And Victims bloud with impious Hands did spill;</l>
            <l>He first wore Buboes dreadfull to the sight,</l>
            <l>First felt strange Pains and sleepless past the Night;</l>
            <l>From him the Malady receiv'd its name,</l>
            <l>The neighbouring Shepherds catcht the spreading Flame:</l>
            <l>At last in City and in Court 'twas known,</l>
            <l>And seiz'd th' ambitious Monarch on his Throne;</l>
            <l>In this distress the wretched Tribes repair</l>
            <l>To <hi>Ammerice</hi> the Gods Interpreter,</l>
            <l>Chief Priestess of the consecrated Wood,</l>
            <l>In whose Retreats the awfull Tripod stood,</l>
            <l>From whence the Gods responsal she exprest;</l>
            <l>The Crowd enquire what Cause produc'd this Pest,</l>
            <l>What God enrag'd? and how to be appeas'd,</l>
            <l>And last what Cure remain'd for the Diseas'd?</l>
            <l>To whom the Nymph reply'd—the Sun incens'd,</l>
            <l>With just revenge these Torments has commenc'd.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:40932:50"/>What man can with immortal Pow'rs compare?</l>
            <l>Fly, wretches, fly, his Altars soon repair,</l>
            <l>Load them with Incense, Him with Pray'rs invade,</l>
            <l>His Anger will not easily be laid;</l>
            <l>Your Doom is past, black <hi>Styx</hi> has heard him swear,</l>
            <l>This Plague should never be extinguisht here,</l>
            <l>Since then your Soil must ne'er be wholly free,</l>
            <l>Beg Heav'n at least to yield some Remedy:</l>
            <l>A milkwhite Cow on <hi>Iuno</hi>'s Altar lay,</l>
            <l>To Mother Earth a jet-black Heifer slay;</l>
            <l>One from above the happy Seeds shall shed,</l>
            <l>The other rear the Grove and make it spread,</l>
            <l>That onely for your Grief a Cure shall yield.</l>
            <l>She said: the Croud return'd to th' open'd Field,</l>
            <l>Rais'd Altars to the Sun without delay,</l>
            <l>To Mother Earth, and <hi>Iuno</hi> Victims slay.</l>
            <l>'Twill seem most strange what now I shall declare,</l>
            <l>But by our Gods and Ancestours I swear,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:40932:50"/>'Tis sacred Truth—</l>
            <l>These Groves that spread so wide and look so green</l>
            <l>Within this Isle, till then, were never seen,</l>
            <l>But now before their Eyes the Plants were found</l>
            <l>To spring, and in an instant Shade the ground,</l>
            <l>The Priest forthwith bids Sacrifice be done,</l>
            <l>And Justice paid to the offended Sun;</l>
            <l>Some destin'd Head t'attone the Crimes of all,</l>
            <l>On <hi>Syphilus</hi> the dreadfull Lot did fall,</l>
            <l>Who now was plac'd before the Altar bound,</l>
            <l>His head with sacrificial Garlands crown'd,</l>
            <l>His Throat laid open to the lifted Knife,</l>
            <l>But interceding <hi>Iuno</hi> spar'd his Life,</l>
            <l>Commands them in his stead a Heifer slay,</l>
            <l>For <hi>Phoebus</hi> Rage was now remov'd away.</l>
            <l>This made our gratefull Ancestours enjoin,</l>
            <l>When first these annual Rites they did assign,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:40932:51"/>That to the Altar bound a Swine each time</l>

            <l>All this infected Throng whom you behold,</l>
            <l>Smart for their Ancestours Offence of old:</l>
            <l>To heal their Plague this Sacrifice is done,</l>
            <l>And reconcile them to th' offended Sun.</l>
            <l>The Rites perform'd, the hallow'd Boughs they seize,</l>
            <l>The speedy certain Cure for their Disease.</l>
            <l>With such discourse the Chiefs their Cares de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,</l>
            <l>Whose Tribes of different Worlds united live,</l>
            <l>Till now the Ships sent back to <hi>Europes</hi> shore,</l>
            <l>Return and bring prodigious Tidings o'er.</l>
            <l>That this Disease did now through <hi>Europe</hi> rage,</l>
            <l>Nor any Med'cine found that cou'd assuage,</l>
            <l>That in their Ships no slender Number mourn'd,</l>
            <l>With Boils without and inward Ulcers burn'd.</l>
            <l>Then call'd to mind the Bird's prophetick sound,</l>

            <l>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:40932:51"/>Then each with solemn Vows the Sun entreats,</l>
            <l>And gentle Nymphs the Gardians of those Seats.</l>
            <l>With lusty Strokes the Grove they next invade,</l>
            <l>Whose weighty Boughs are on their Shoulders laid,</l>
