            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Boundage is the compaſſing and deſcribing of Plots with their buttalls, metes, bounds and Coaſtage.</p>
               <p>Boundage is either contiguall or Remote.</p>
               <p>Contiguall Boundage preſcribes &amp; limits-forth the extention of lands, by immediate and ſelfe-continuance of the confining Boundaries; &amp; is either ſimple or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, both which may be either Actiue, intimating that the ſenſing or incloſing of the Plot appertaines to the Poſſident; Or Paſſiue inferring that it is incloſed or laid in ſeueraltie by the adiacent.</p>
               <p>Simple Boundage is Confrontage and Collaterage, both which with all other Boundages are capable of diuers peculiar variations deriuable from the diuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the cauſes and occurrents obſerued in perambula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Confrontage Actiue may enter the Plot with theſe or the like Epithetons, Abutting, Heading, facing, fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,<note place="margin">Confrontage</note> ſteighing, &amp;c. Or Paſſiue headed, faced, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Collaterage Actiue, as ſiding, ſurrowing, balking,<note place="margin">Collaterage</note> dyling, haying, hedging or ſhawing, immounding, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payling, immuring, ſkirting, Girding, verging, mazing, couruing, recouruing, bordering, confining; alſo lying, Bounding, extending betweene: Or Paſſiue.</p>
               <p>Compound Contiguall Boundage is more ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, as ſide-haying, head-ſhawing, &amp;c.<note place="margin">Compound.</note> likewiſe boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, limitted, preſcribed, compaſſed, included, termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, determinated, collaterally, triangularly, quarterly,

               <p>And ſometimes this Compound Boundage implies a mutuall propertie or duety participable to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminants, as bancking, balking, dyking, dray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ſewing, ſewaging, rilling, brooking, riuaging, foor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, alwaies confining the conterminants with the particle <hi>Cúm</hi>: And yet more ſpecially, as head-diking, ſide-ſewing, &amp;c. and the like Paſſiuely: and any of theſe may be admitted into the rough-booke.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Remote.</note>Remote Boundage is requiſite for retriuing and manifeſting the locall proiection of Plots in ſupply of the defect of memorie and metes and markes contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent; and is accompliſhed either by Obiects remarke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able (inuiſible are improper, though our Hollanders, will néedes bound their Coaſt-lands vpon Normandy miſtaking it for Norman-déepe ſtumbled vpon in ſome obliterate déedes, where Germanie might better be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.) as Mountaines, Hills, Towers, Stéeples, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Edifices, Trées of ſuper-eminence and Markes, and ſometimes waies, balkes, hedges, Riuers, pits and ſuch like, may effect as much being lined, rainged, recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, opened, diſcloſed or cut by extention of common right-lines from fixed or noted ſtations.</p>
               <p>There is another ſpecies of this Remote or Mediate Boundage, where the Plot extendes not fully to the Méets or Bounds deſcribed, but is intercepted by ſome ſmal Intermediall; as Balke, Méere, bancke, lane, path, Rill or ſuch like; but this manner of Bounding, though it bée frequent, is improper and defectiue, wanting that perſpicuity which ſhould giue viue Validity to all Records.</p>

               <p>If out of ſight and in Champion not much ſwelling,<note place="margin">To a Place not in view.</note> it is expedient to place two Aſſiſtants, the one at the marke, and the other at the eminenteſt Medium, and then your ſelfe ſtanding at (or directly beyond or ſhort) the ſtation giuen, and the firſt Aſſiſtant erecting ſome viſible obiect, waft the Wadders into the Wadd.

               </p>
               <p>The firſt depends vpon the knowledge of Sines and Tangents, and is founded vpon this Theoreme.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In all right-lined Triangles the mutuall proportion of one Latus to another, is ſuch, as the Sines reſpecting their Angles are proportionall.</hi>
