            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

How a man may know when that

our ſpirit. The occaſion moving

by ſome ſpeech vttered by
me in preaching: ſayinge it was

wherefore I did ſay ſo: and
next, I will doe my beſt to ſatisfie
your queſtion, as the Lord hath
given me to vnderſtand.</p>
            <p>It is moſt certaine, that a mans
owne heart (being a thing, as ſaith
<hi>Ieremie, Chap. 17. deceitfull above all
things)</hi> will oft times deceyve man
him ſelf, and yeeld him a falſe Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie
of him ſelfe, as alſo of his
actions and eſtate. Is it not ſaid of
the Angell of the Church of <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicea:</hi>
that he ſaid of him ſelf: <hi>I am
ritch &amp; increaſed with goods,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reve. 3. 17<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> 
               <hi>&amp; have
need of nothing.</hi> This doubtles was
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:18605:4"/>
his owne teſtimonie of him ſelfe.
But what doeth the ſpirit of God
witnes of him: <hi>Thou art wretched,
and miſerable, and poore, and blind, &amp;
naked.</hi> And moreover doth affirme
that this Angell did not know he
was ſo.</p>
            <p>Doth not Chriſt alſo teach vs in
the Goſpell,<note place="margin">Luke. 18.</note> that there bee ſome
whoſe hartes deceyve them, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
them truſt in themſelves that
they are iuſt, and yet are not, and
cleares it by the example of the
<hi>Phariſee,</hi> giving thankes vnto God,
<hi>That he was not as other men, extorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner,
vniust, &amp;c.</hi> who notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
is accompted of God vniuſt.
And to be ſhort, in this point the
Lord Ieſus ſheweth vs that many
men at his ſecond comming, ſhall
be miſerably deceived by the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
teſtimonie of their own harts:
ſome being confident becauſe of
the outward fellowſhip and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaritie
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:18605:5"/>
they have had with Chriſt,
both in Word &amp; Sacraments, and
therefore pleading thus:<note place="margin">Luc. 13. 22<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> 
               <hi>We have
eaten and dronke in thy preſence, and
thou has taught in our ſtreetes,</hi> ſhall
nevertheleſſe receyve this anſwer:
<hi>I tell you, I know you not whence you
are, depart from me.</hi> Others alſo v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the confidence of giftes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
vpon them by Chriſt for
the good of his Church, pleading
with him and ſaying:<note place="margin">Mat. 7. 22.</note> 
               <hi>Lord, Lord,
have we not by thy Name prophecied,
and by thy Name cast out Divels, and
by thy Name done many great works?</hi>
ſhall receyve the ſame anſwere.</p>
            <p>Heereby it is evident, that the
teſtimonie of a mans owne heart
being alone may be deceitfull, eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
when it is builded vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> profeſſion
and outward participation of the
holy things of GOD. Yea even
when it is builded vpon ſome rare
ſpeciall giftes of the holy ghoſt,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:18605:5"/>
which although they bee neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
for the body or Church in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,
yet are not requiſit in every
member to ſalvation, ſuch as is the
gift of <hi>Prophecying, &amp;c.</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
may both be wanting with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
preiudice, and alſo had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
enioying of ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Thus have wee reaſon not to
truſt our Adoption and certaintie
of our ſalvation, to the naked te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie
of our owne hearts, leaſt
we be found like the fooliſh Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines.
It is true, the teſtimonie of
our owne hearts is needfull heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto,
becauſe ſayeth the Apoſtle,
<hi>If our heartes condempne vs,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Ioh. 3. 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> 
               <hi>God is
greater then our heartes: and if our
hearts condempne vs not, then have
we boldnes towards God.</hi> But it muſt
not be alone, for ſo it ſhal never be
ſure, but having the ſpirit witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
with it, then it is ſure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:18605:6"/>
Now yet before I ſpeake of the
diſcerning of the ſpirites teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
I muſt forewarne you of this
one thing, to wit, that there bee
many effectes of the ſpirit in the
Saints oft times, which at the firſt
the Saintes know not to bee from
the ſpirit, and that both in their
firſt calling, and after they be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and therefore wee muſt not
meaſure the working of the ſpirit
in vs by our diſcerning, neyther
muſt we iudge our ſelves deſtitute
of the ſpirit, albeit wee doe not
diſcerne the effectes wrought in
vs, to bee from the ſpirit: for the
Saints will feele ſtrange effectes
wrought in their mindes, which
they will neither knowe whence
they come, nor wherevnto they
tend. This is verified by Ieſus
Chriſt him ſelf, ſpeaking of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
working of the ſpirit in our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:18605:6"/>
birth, whereby we are made
the children of God, comparinge
it to the winde: <hi>The winde</hi> (ſaieth
he) <hi>bloweth where it liſteth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Io. 3. 8.</note> 
               <hi>and thou
heareſt the ſound thereof, but can not
tell whence it commeth, nor whether it
goeth:</hi> ſo is every ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (ſaith Chriſt)
<hi>that is borne of the ſpirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This ſhall not ſeeme ſtrange to
vs if we marke what is ſaide of the
Diſciples at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> who were
baptized as appeareth by <hi>Apollos,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts. 19. 2</note>
and yet they confeſſe to <hi>Paul</hi> that
they had not ſo much as heard
whether there were an H. ghoſt.
It may bee alſo very apparantlie
thought, that <hi>Peter</hi> when hee did
witneſſe of Chriſt, that he was the
Chriſt <hi>the Sonne of the living God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 16. 16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note>
did not knowe that teſtimonie to
have bene from the ſpirit of God,
and therefore Chriſt (to teach
him that that teſtimonie was not
the teſtimonie of his owne heart,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:18605:7"/>
but by the ſpirit of God) did tell
him that fleſh and bloud had not
reveyled that to him, but his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that is in heaven.</p>
            <p>This I ſpeake not to make men
careleſſe in trying whether they
have the ſpirit or no, but to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
weake Chriſtians, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they have the livelie ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectes
of the ſpirit, yet have not
come ſo farre as to bee able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
them to be from the ſpirit,
as ſometimes they will bee taught
to vnderſtande, and can not tell
how at the firſt, and to repent, and
can not tell how, and to reioyce,
and can not tell how, and to love
God and his Saints, and can not
tell how, and to beleeve, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell how, which all notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
are the proper workes of
the ſpirit.</p>

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:18605:7"/>
touching the diſcerning of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
teſtimonie, which I pray the
Lord to teach vs all, ſeeing there
can indeed no ſolide ioy poſſeſſe
our mindes, till we feele the ſpirit
of Adoption ſealing vp the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie
of our electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in our harts:
for if we bee ſonnes (as ſaieth the
Apoſtle) <hi>the Lord hath ſent forth the
ſpirit of his ſonne in our heartes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Galat 4. 6.</note> 
               <hi>which
crieth Abba,</hi>

               <hi>Father:</hi> and therefore
<hi>if any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath not the ſpirit of Chriſt,
the ſame is not his.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seeing then it is even by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
which he hath give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, that we
know our ſelves to bee the ſonnes
of God, and that God as our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
abydeth in vs,<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 3. 24.</note> as ſaieth <hi>Iohn:</hi>
It is a moſt neceſſarie ſtudie, and
moſt commendable in a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
to trie if he hath the ſpirit.</p>
            <p>Now therefore to come to your
queſtion, I will ſpeake of it in all
ſobrietie accordinge to that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:18605:8"/>
of faith which the Lord hath
given me.</p>
            <p>Firſt in generall, it ſhall not bee
amiſſe to know what is the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
of the ſpirit.</p>
            <p>Secondly, after what maner the
ſpirit doth give teſtimonie.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, we ſhall cleerlie ſee
how to diſcerne it from the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
of our owne ſpirit.</p>
            <p>In generall, the whole word of
God is the teſtimonie of the ſpirit.
For whatſoever is therein contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
the ſpirit doeth witnes it, and
nothing els doeth the ſpirit wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
but that which is contayned
in the word: therefore is the word
of God called his Teſtimon.<note place="margin">Pſal. 19.</note> 
               <hi>The
teſtimonie of the Lord is ſure.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine:
<hi>God establiſhed a Teſtimonie
in Iacob.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 79.</note> And oft times in the 119.
Pſalme, the Lords wordes are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>his Teſtimonies,</hi> becauſe everie
ſentence of the word, is a teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:18605:8"/>
of Gods will: Therefore is it
that the Prophet commands vs to
goe to the Lawe and to the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie.
<note place="margin">Eſa. 8.</note> For nothing can we know
of Gods minde towards vs, except
we hearken what the ſpirit ſpeakes
in his worde. and therefore, Chriſt
willeth vs to ſearch the Scriptures,<note place="margin">Ioh. 5. 39.</note>
becauſe they witnes of him. So,
whatſoever the worde doeth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
our hearts touching GOD
and his love in Chriſt, that is the
Teſtimonie of the ſpirit: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when hearing the worde of
God, our hearts receyves anie aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
or perſwaſion of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
remiſſion of ſinnes, &amp;c. that
ſame is and muſt be the ſpirits te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie.
As for example, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by
the word a man is made to knowe
Chriſt to be the Lord, the Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
&amp;c. doubtleſſe that is a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
of Gods ſpirit, by the word
witneſſing to the heart that trueth
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:18605:9"/>
and cauſing the heart to beleve it.
But heere wee muſt carefully take
heede, that our hearts bee not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyved
touching that which you
moſt diſire to know, that is, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our Adoption, by miſtaking
the ſpirits teſtimonie. For eſchew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this danger we have to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande
that the ſpirit by the worde
perſwades two maner of wayes, to
wit, generallie and ſpeciallie, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerallie
when that which is revey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
out of the worde is generally
beleeved as Gods truth: ſpeciallie
when it is ſpeciallie beleeved. The
generall is no warrant of adoptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
For in that ſort the very Divells
beleeve and tremble,<note place="margin">Iam. 2. 19.</note> ſaieth <hi>Iames:</hi> a
reprobate may beleeve generally
all to be true which is in the word
of God, and yet never have anie
teſtimonie of the ſpirit, of his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
adoption, hee may beleeve
that Chriſt is a Saviour of ſinners,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:18605:9"/>
and yet not beleeve that hee is a
Saviour vnto him: he may beleeve
that God in Chriſt will forgive
ſinners: and yet no wayes have
aſſurance of the remiſſion of his
owne ſinnes: yea hee may bee a
Preacher, and be witnes of all the
promiſes of God in Chriſt to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
&amp; yet have no parte in them
him ſelfe. Therefore leaving this
generall teſtimonie of the ſpirit, I
come to the ſpeciall teſtimonie,
which wee muſt diſcerne before
our Adoption bee ſealed to vs.
And in diſcerning this, there is
alſo great wiſedome required:
for therein alſo may a man be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyved.
For there is ſome ſort of
ſpeciall teſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that witneſſeth
not adoption. For vnderſtanding
hereof, we muſt conſider that the
ſpirits teſtimonie in ſpeciall maner
is of two ſortes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:18605:10"/>
The firſt is, when hee witneſſes
and reveiles grace particularlie to
a man, but imprints not the thing
reveiled in the heart, neither ſeales
it in his ſoule.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is, when not onely
he reveyles and witneſſes the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
in ſpeciall manner to a man,
but alſo writeth them in his heart,
and ſeales them in his ſoule. Now
to make this more plaine, we muſt
conſider what are the wordes of
Gods covenant in Chriſt with the
elect. After theſe dayes (ſaieth the
Lord) <hi>I will put my Lawes in their
minde,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ier. 31. Heb. 8.</note> 
               <hi>and in their heart I will write
them.</hi> If we waye theſe wordes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
we ſhall ſee that which I
have ſpoken, cleere. GOD in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
his Lawe ſpake to his people,
and by his ſpirit witneſſed his will
to them: but this word which was
ſpoken, was not written in their
hearts, but in tables of ſtone: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:18605:10"/>
the Iewes did not abyde in
that covenant. The peculiar pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
of God to the elect in Chriſt
is,<note place="margin">Hebr. 8. 9.</note> that he ſhall write his wordes in
their hearts. When the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lords
ſpirit, witneſſeth, &amp; in witneſſing
writes the thing witneſſed, in the
heart, it is an aſſurance of Gods
effectuall ſpeaking: but when hee
witneſſes to the heart, &amp; yet writes
not that teſtimonie in the heart, it
is no teſtimonie of adoption. To
make this plaine: it is certaine,
there can be no true faith in the
heart, where the worde of GOD
abydeth not. Chriſt ſhewes this in
the fift chap. of <hi>Iohn,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 5. 38.</note> ſpeakinge to
the Iewes, <hi>His worde</hi> (ſayeth hee)
<hi>have ye not abyding in you, becauſe yee
beleeve not in him whom he hath ſent:</hi>
declaring that the abyding of the
worde in man, and beleeving, doe
ſtill acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie one the other. And
if we will conſider his ſpeech in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:18605:11"/>
the ſixt chap. of Iohn, wee ſhall ſee
that the cauſe why his worde did
not abyde in them,<note place="margin">Ioh. 6. 45.</note> was, becauſe
they were not taught of God, that
is, they had not hard nor learned
of the Father, according to his pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>miſe,
I will put my lawes in their
minde; and in their heart will I
write them: therefore it is that
Moſes ſpeakinge of the eſtate of
the choſen children of God vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
grace, ſaith, that this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which I command thee this
day (meaning thereby the worde
of the Father) <hi>is not hid from thee,
neither is it farre from thee,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 30. 12.</note> 
               <hi>it is not
in the heaven, that thou ſhouldeſt ſay,
who ſhall goe vp for vs to heaven, and
bring it vs, and cauſe vs to heare it,
that we may do it: neither is it beyond
the ſea, that thou ſhouldest ſay, who ſhall
goe over the ſea for vs, and bring it vs
and cauſe vs to heare it, that wee may
doe it: but the word is very neare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:18605:11"/>
thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy
heart for to doe it.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 68.</note> The Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds
the ſame to the Rom. and
ſhewes that this is the word of the
Father which they did preach. For
this is the promiſe of God to his
Church vnder the Goſpell, by the
mouth of his Prophet:<note place="margin">Eſay. 54. 13.</note> 
               <hi>All thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
ſhalbe taught of the Lord:</hi> and
this is the Lords teaching, eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
writing of his word in the hart by
his ſpirit.<note place="margin">Ioh. 8. 30.</note> Of the firſt ſort of this
ſpeciall receyving the word, you
may read in Iohn: it is ſaid of the
Iewes, <hi>many beleeved in Chriſt,</hi> &amp; yet
theſe ſame doth Chriſt declare to
be the ſervants of ſinne, &amp; childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of the divel, &amp; murtherers. and in
the 37. verſe he ſhewes why they
were ſuch, becauſe his word had
no place in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: therefore doth he
warn the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the 31. ver. that if they
did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue in his word, they were
verily his diſcipl. teaching thereby
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:18605:12"/>
that it is not the receyving of his
word ſimplie, that maketh vs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples:
but the abydiug in it,
which none can doe that hath it
not written in their heart by the
ſpirit. Of the ſecond ſorte of the
ſpeciall receyving the word, you
may read in the 17. chap. of Iohn,
in the wordes of Chriſt concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
his Diſciples: <hi>I have given
them the wordes which thou gavest
mee,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh 17. 8.</note> 
               <hi>&amp; they have receyved them, &amp;c.</hi>
Of both theſe ſortes of receyving
the ſpirites teſtimonie, you may
read in the Goſpell of Saint <hi>Math.</hi>
in the Parable of the Sower, the
one is like the ground which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyveth
ſeed,<note place="margin">Mat. 13. 18.</note> but yeeldeth no
fruit againe: the other is like the
ground which receiveth the ſeed,
and bringeth forth fruit in aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance:
becauſe God the Father is
the Huſbande man thereof: as
Chriſt ſayeth in the 15. chapter of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:18605:12"/>
Iohn. But you may aſke, how I
can call this ſorte of witneſſinge
which is fruitleſſe, to be the ſpirits
teſtimonie? Reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber I pray you
what the Apoſtle ſaieth to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi>
No man can call Ieſus
Lord but by the H. ghoſt.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 3.</note> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it is plaine that there is no poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilitie
in man of receyving or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
any part of that my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie
of godlynes, without the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
working. And yet, albeit this
be the worke of the ſpirit, yet doth
it not prove him in whom it is, to
be the childe of God. For Chriſt
ſaieth plainly,<note place="margin">Mat. 7. 21.</note> 
               <hi>Not every one that call
me Lord, Lorde, shall enter into the
kingdome of heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And becauſe this ſame effect in
the verie reprobate,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 14.</note> is the work of
the ſpirit (for the naturall man can
not perceyve the things of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit)
therefore are the very repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
thus illuminate after this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:18605:13"/>
ſaid, to have bene made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of the H. ghoſt,<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 4.</note> not that ever
that ſpirit of Adoptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which God
ſendes foorth in the heartes of his
ſonnes to ſeale them vnto the day
of redemption, was ever ſent into
their hearts. But becauſe even that
light &amp; taſt of heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly things whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
they received, was by the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the H. ghoſt: although he
never did give the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ful poſſeſſion of
them by imprinting them in their
harts, &amp; ſealing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their ſoules.
For that which Chriſt ſaith to his
diſcip. (whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he promiſeth to ſend
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſpirit of truth) remayneth
ſtill true, that the world can not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him,<note place="margin">Ioh. 14. 17</note> becauſe it ſeeth him not
neither knoweth him: &amp; therfore
wee may iuſtly ſay, that they who
receive this taſt of Chriſt &amp; of the
good word of god, do not diſcern
the ſpirit to worke theſe thinges,
becauſe they neither ſee him nor
know him, neither ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they receive
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:18605:13"/>
him, but are like vnto natural men,
who albeit they have their being,<note place="margin">Act. 17. 28<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note>
&amp; life, &amp; moving in God, yet ſtill
remain without God in this world.<note place="margin">Ephe. 2. 12.</note>
But it may the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be demanded how
it is that they are ſaid to bee made
partakers of the H. ghoſt? and what
difference is there betwixt them &amp;
the elect in the participatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the
ſpirit? To vnderſtand this, we muſt
remember that ther muſt be a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
participatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſpirit wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
any effect of the ſpirit is
fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in whatſoever meaſure or ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner.
But we are to mark a differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
both of meaſure &amp; maner. For as a
ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that hath an excellent piece of
wine to ſel, wil give to al that com,
ſo much as is ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
knowe the taſt of it, yet he giveth
not to every one ſuch a qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>titie as
is ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to bring nouriſhment &amp;
refreſhment to their bodyes &amp; ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.
And as a phiſicion that hath
prepared a comfortable potio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:18605:14"/>
the health of a beloved patient, he
will give to others a little of it to
make them apprehende the taſte
of it: but not ſo, as to have anie
ſtrength to make anie operation in
their ſtomacke: for that quantitie
hee gives onely to the patient for
whoſe health it is prepared.</p>
            <p>Nowe they who taſted of this
wine or potion, can diſcerne the
goodneſſe of it, albeit they never
did drinke it, nor ever be partakers
of the refreſhing power of it.</p>
            <p>So is it with the Lorde in his
diſpenſation: he vſeth ſometimes
onely to give a naked ſight and
knowledge of Chriſt, and his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
in him, to men: and this I cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
before a generall perſwaſion of
the ſpirit, when men are made to
know Chriſt in generall, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all ſenſe of feelinge of him.</p>
            <p>Somtimes the ſpirit comes nearer,
and touches the heart with Chriſt
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:18605:14"/>
and with the powers of the world
to come, even ſo farre, as the heart
receiveth a taſt of the love of God,
&amp; of the mercies of God in Chriſt,
in ſuch ſorte, that they receive the
word incontinentlie with ioy:<note place="margin">Math. 13. 20.</note> as
ſaith Chriſt. The ſpirit havinge in
that meaſure teſtified the worde
to them, as is ſufficient to make
them to taſte the ſweetnes of it:
albeeit hee never fill their heart
with it, nor imprint it in their
mindes, that they may finde the
power of it vnto life. The laſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of the ſpirites witneſſinge, is,
when not onely he touches the
lippes with grace to make the taſt
of it felt: but when hee poures in
the love of God, and all the graces
reveyled in the worde, and ſhedds
them abroad in the heart: as ſaith
the Apoſtle to the Romans,<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 5.</note> and
ſo makes the heart to enioy, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyve
and poſſeſſe the promiſe by
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:18605:15"/>
printing it therein. So that the
working and witneſſing of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
in the wicked, is like the ſmell
of an Apothecaris ſhop: which
one that paſſeth by, receyveth, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
hee never carrie anie of
theſe odoriferous things with him
But the witneſſing of the ſpirit, to
the elect, is by imparting the thing
witneſſed to the ſoule, &amp; making
it reallie to poſſeſſe it. So that if a
man could ſee the ſoule of a true
child of God, he ſhould ſee ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in it, mercie, peace, love, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes,
life, ioy, and Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.
all the promiſes of God in
Chriſt, being written therein, by
the ſpirit, according to the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of God. Conforme to this,
doth the Apoſtle ſpeake of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rits
witneſſing to the hearts of the
Corinthians, when hee ſaieth, <hi>yee
are manifeſt to bee the Epiſtle of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:18605:15"/>
Chriſt, miniſtred by vs, and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
not with inck, but with the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
of the livinge GOD: not in
Tables of ſtone, but in fleſhly tables of
the heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nowe therefore wee come to
ſpeake of this witneſſinge of the
ſpirit which is proper to the elect:
And to the ende wee may cleere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
diſcerne, the teſtimonie of
the ſpirit, which witneſſeth with
our ſpirits, that we are the ſonnes
of GOD: wee muſt yet more
deepelie marke and conſider this
teſtimonie.</p>
            <p>The worke of the ſpirit in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring
vs of Adoption, is twoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folde.</p>
            <p>The firſte, for diſtinction, wee
ſhall call this firſt writinge of the
worde reveyled, in our hearts,
and ſo makinge vs to beleeve in
God,<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 13.</note> as our God and Father in
Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:18605:16"/>
               <hi>The ſecond, is our ſealling, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
we have beleeved. That it is
ſo, ye may ſee in the wordes of the
Apoſtle to the Epheſians.</hi> In whom
alſo <hi>(ſayes he)</hi> ye have trusted after
that yee heard the word of trueth,<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 13.</note> even
the Goſpell of your ſalvation, wherein
alſo after yee beleeved, yee were ſealed
with the holy ſpirit of promiſe.</p>
            <p>Marke firſt this worke of the
ſpirit, in cauſing vs to beleeve in
God, by the effectuall revelation
of the worde: next, marke that
other worke of the ſpirit, after we
have beleeved, in ſealing vs. The
firſt of theſe two, although it bee
felt by vs, yet at the firſt, wee can
not diſcerne it to be the worke of
the ſpirit, till afterward. For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we be made ſpirituall, we can
diſcerne nothing of the ſpirit: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the things of the ſpirit are
ſpiritually diſcerned.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.</note> But when
we receyve the ſpirit which is of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:18605:16"/>
God, then are we able to knowe
the things which are given to vs
of God. Therefore that teſtimonie
whereof the Apoſtle ſpeaketh to
the Rom. which witneſſeth with
our ſpirits: is to be vnderſtood of
the ſeconde worke of the ſpirit,
which is our ſealing.</p>
            <p>That we may vnderſtande this
aright, we muſt conſider that there
is ſomething that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth in in vs
betwixt the firſt worke of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and the ſecond. And that is the
teſtimonie of our owne ſpirit, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
witnes, that we are the ſonnes
of God. For when God by his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
hath imprinted in our heartes,
the word of promiſe, then begins
our hearts to ſay, we are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

Now it might ſeeme there nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

what Chriſt ſaith to <hi>Peter,</hi>

               <hi>Simon,
Simon, behold Sathan hath deſired to
ſift you as wheat, but I have prayed for
thee that thy faith faile not.</hi> So wee
have need that our heartes be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
in that worke of the ſpirit,
otherwayes we ſhould bee in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to make ſhipwracke of faith &amp;
of a good conſcience: which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

the Church pray in the Pſalme:<note place="margin">Pſal. 68. 28.</note>
               <hi>Establiſh O God that which thou hast

that this ſealing of vs, by ſendinge

For when firſt hee hath ſhewed,

expreſſed: accordinge to the

in their calling: the other by an
earneſt, which is a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmation of

of the full ſomme:<note place="margin">Dan. 6. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſealing, which in all writes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractes,

and promiſed. Accordinge to
which, amongſt the <hi>Perſians,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſoever
was ſealed with the Kinges
Ring, could not bee changed nor
revoked. Therefore, whomſoever
God ſeales vnto life, as his child:
he is made moſt ſure of eternall
life. For this cauſe is it, that in the
Revelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">Revel. 7. 3</note> God firſt will have his
childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſealed before the enemies
can have power to execute their
malice,<note place="margin">Ma. 16. 18</note> and of theſe thus ſealed, it
is, that Chriſt ſaieth, <hi>that the gates
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:18605:19"/>
of hell ſhall not prevayle against them.</hi>
And <hi>that they shall never periſh, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

            </p>
            <p>Now, this ſame ſending foorth
of the ſpirit of Adoption in our
hearts, is our ſealinge. Therefore
ſaieth the Apoſt. to the Epheſians,
<hi>ye were ſealed with the holy ſpirit of
promiſe.</hi> And this ſame is alſo our
anointing, poured out vpon vs, as
that oyle on <hi>Aaron:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioel 2. 28.</note> therefore are
we ſaide to have this annointing
from him which is holy,<note place="margin">Act. 2. 17.</note> and that
it teacheth vs,<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 2. 2.</note> and that it is true, &amp;
not lying: according to that whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
is ſaid by Chriſt of the ſpirit:
<hi>I will pray the Father,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Io. 14.</note> 
               <hi>&amp; he will give
you another comforter, that hee may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byde
with you for ever, even the ſpirit
of trueth, he shall teach you all things;</hi>
And the ſame alſo is our earneſt:<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 5</note>
therefore it is called the earneſt of
the ſpirit: and alſo the firſt fruites
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:18605:19"/>
of the ſpirit. So by the ſame ſpirit,
as by oyle, as by earneſt, as by a
ſeale, doth God ſtabliſh our harts,
in that which they doe witnes to
vs, touching our Adoption. And
that doth the Apoſtle ſignifie whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he ſaieth,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 16.</note> 
               <hi>the ſame ſpirit beareth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
with our ſpirits, that wee are the
ſonnes of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Marke then the order of Gods
working. Firſt he ſpeakes the word
of trueth to the heart, and in ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
writes it in the heart: heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
the heart is made to beleeve
that which it hath heard &amp; recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
from the ſpirit: and when it
beleeves, it ſpeakes, and the thing
it ſpeakes, is that ſame, which is
engrave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in it, by the ſpirit: to wit,
that God is his God, and hee his
child. For never can the hart of a
man ſpeak one word of mercie to
him, nor of Adoption, till the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God have ſpoken firſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:18605:20"/>
to it. Nowe when the ſpirit of
man hath ſpoken, and given teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
to him, of his election, he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
the Lord for eſtabliſhing the heart
in this, and confirming man in the
teſtimonie of his heart, he addeth
his ſpirit: and by the teſtimonie
thereof, ſeales this promiſe in the
heart, and makes Adoption and
eternall life, moſt certaine and ſure
to the ſoule, that he dare be bold
with the Apoſtle to ſay,<note place="margin">Ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 8. 33.</note> 
               <hi>Who ſhall

from the love of Christ: I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
that neither death nor life, nor

            </p>
            <p>And that we may yet more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentlie
ſee the neceſſitie of this te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie
of Gods ſpirit: we are to
conſider that albeit our own harts
have in them a power to witnes
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:18605:20"/>
vnto vs what wee are both by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and by grace, yet the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
of our heartes touching our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
by grace, is not ſo fullie and
confidentlie to bee repoſed vpon
and truſted, as the teſtimonie ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
touching our eſtate by nature.
For wee may aſſuredly truſt our
hearts and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciences,<note place="margin">Deut. 27. 21.</note> when vpon
anie guiltines they condemne vs,
ſeeing hee is curſed who abydes

it:<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 10.</note> &amp; he that tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſgreſſeth one co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,
<note place="margin">Iam. 2. 10.</note> is guiltie of all: but we
are not always to give abſolut cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
to our conſciences, when vpon
conceit of innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie they iuſtifie
vs. For although our conſciences
accuſe vs of nothing, yet thereby
we are not iuſtified, as is plaine by
the ſaying of the Apoſt. touching
himſelf 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. the reaſon here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is, becauſe our conſciences doe
not ſo cleerlie ſee our eſtate which
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:18605:21"/>
is from God, neither can they of
them ſelves ſo truely iudge of it, as
they may do of their eſtate by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
when they are illuminate by
God: for then they are made to
know and cleerly to ſee that in vs
there is no goodnes, and therefore
ther is iuſt reaſon why they ſhould
condempne vs. And we are verily
to beleeve our harts vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this ſight
and knowledge condempning vs.
but on the other part, although
we ſee the minde of God towards
vs in Chriſt, yet wee can not ſo
throughly apprehende his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
vpon any ſight we receive, that
we dar truſt our felicitie abſolutly
to the teſtimonie of our owne
hearts. Firſt, becauſe our heartes
may be deceyved, as is evident by
ſcripture, that many ſhall bee. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
becauſe wee may miſtake
the working of God in vs, and lay
hold on a wrong ground. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:18605:21"/>
becauſe our heartes are more
prone to ſpeake good nor evill of
our ſelves, even when they have
neuer ſo ſmall occſion to doe ſo,
and when they have much more
occaſion to do the contrarie. And
laſtlie, becauſe all men are lyars, &amp;
onely God is true, and therfore we
muſt never give ſo much credit to
our conſciences, ſpeaking good of
vs, as when they ſpeake evill: ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie
when the queſtion is of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſonnes of God, or not: ſo
that even when they witnes that
we are the ſonnes of God, wee are
not to reſt herevpon except God,
who only knoweth whom he hath
choſen, doe by his ſpirit confirme
the teſtimonie of our ſpirit. For
we may much more ſurely truſt
our heartes in that which is in our
ſelves and from our ſelves, then in
that which is neither from our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves
nor in our ſelves, but is the free
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:18605:22"/>
gift of God in Chriſt. Therefore
that we ſhould not bee deceyved
by our deceitful harts, God ſecou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
our owne teſtimonie tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
his taking of vs for his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
by his ſpirit, witneſſinge the
ſame: even as by his owne mouth
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firming our adoptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For by the
mouth of two or three witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
ſhal everie word be ſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>Thus I have ſhewen you what
is the ſpirits teſtimonie, &amp; in what
manner he gives it, and how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie
it is. Now I come to that
which you deſired to know: that
is, how wee diſcerne the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
of the ſpirit which ſeales our
Adoption from the teſtimonie of
our owne ſpirit. For knowledge of
this, Firſt, let vs conſider, that there
be three things, whereby wee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
our Election and Adoption
from the ſpirit of God. The firſt
is his preſence with vs. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:18605:22"/>
is his worke in vs. The third
is his voyce vnto vs.</p>
            <p>Touching the firſt: the verie
preſence of the ſpirit of Adoptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
is a witneſſe of our Adoption. For
the ſpirit is the earneſt of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
of God, as wee have
ſhewen before: therefore whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
hath the ſpirit, the verie ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of him, is a ſure teſtimonie to
that man, that he is the ſonne of
God: <hi>For he that hath the ſpirit of
Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 9.</note> 
               <hi>he is Chriſtes:</hi> as by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, <hi>hee that hath not the ſpirit of
Chriſt, is not Chriſtes.</hi> Now the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of the ſpirit is diſcerned by
the other two, that is, by the work,
and by the voyce: therefore thoſe
two are chiefly to be conſidered:
firſt his worke in vs, which muſt
go before his voyce: I meane this
voyce which ſeales Adoptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: For
otherwayes his voyce alwayes go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
before his worke: for it is by
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:18605:23"/>
the worde, that hee worketh, all
things in vs.</p>
            <p>For vnderſtanding of this work
and voyce of the ſpirit which ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
adoption, marke the wordes
of the Apoſtle in that ſame eight
chap. of the Rom, touchinge the
ſpirit, <hi>Yee have not receyved</hi> (ſayeth
he) <hi>the ſpirit of bondage to feare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note>
               <hi>but yee have receyved the ſpirit
of Adoption, whereby wee crye, Abba
Father.</hi> Heere Adoption (vnder
which is vnderſtood libertie) is op<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poned
to bondage, as the effect of
the ſpirit. Next, the voyce follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
heerevpon, is manifeſt in the
wordes following: <hi>(whereby wee
crye, Abba, Father).</hi> Which crye,
more plainly is ſaide by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> to bee the
crie of the ſpirit, ſaying: <hi>and becauſe
yee are ſonnes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 6.</note> 
               <hi>God hath ſent forth the
ſpirit of his ſonne in your harts which
cryeth Abba, Father.</hi> And therefore
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:18605:23"/>
is it that the Apoſtle to the <hi>Romans</hi>
ſaieth, <hi>that the ſame ſpirit beareth
witneſſe with our ſpirit, that we are the
children of God.</hi> What then is this
worke of the ſpirit in vs, that wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth
Adoption? This ſpeciall
worke, is, libertie, or freedome: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
ever with peace, bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
confidence, and reioycing.
This is plaine by theſe places of
ſcripture. Firſt, the Apoſtle to the
Corinthians, ſpeaking of this firſt
great effect of the ſpirit,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 3. 17.</note> ſaith: <hi>Now
the Lord is the ſpirit, and where the
ſpirit of the Lord is, there is libertie:</hi>
and of the peace that acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panies
this libertie,<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 13.</note> the Apoſtle ſpeakes
plainlie to the Epheſians, where,
after he hath ſhewe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that by Chriſt
we are delivered from the Law of
commandements &amp; hatred, that
thereby did lye vpon vs, and hath
ſpoken of the peace followinge
therevpon, hee proves this peace
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:18605:24"/>
by theſe wordes: <hi>for through him
wee both haue an entrance vnto the
Father by one ſpirit.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 18</note> Therefore the
ſame Apoſtle to the Romans,
ſayeth,<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 1.</note> 
               <hi>That being iustified by faith,
wee have peace towardes God.</hi> Of this
boldnes and confidence, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
ſpeakes to the Epheſians,
ſaying:<note place="margin">Eph. 3. 12</note> 
               <hi>By whom wee have boldnes
and acceſſe with confidence by faith
in him.</hi> Therefore is it that the
Apoſtle to the Romans, ſayeth:
<hi>That wee have not receyved the ſpirit
of bondage vnto feare, but the ſpirit
that is without feare,</hi> that is, <hi>of bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
and confidence.</hi> Touching re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing,
the Apoſtle Peter ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 8.</note> ſaying: <hi>In whom beleeving, yee
reioyce with ioye vnſpeakeable and
glorious.</hi> The ſame alſo affirmeth
the Apoſtle to the Rom. ſaying <hi>&amp;

we reioyce vnder the hope of the glorie
of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 2.</note> 
               <hi>neither ſo onely, but wee reioyce
alſo in tribulations,</hi> and he addes the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:18605:24"/>
reaſon, <hi>becauſe the love of God is ſhed
abroad in our heartes by the holy ghost
which is given vnto vs.</hi> This I call
the ſpeciall working of the ſpirit,
for ſealing our Adoption: becauſe
theſe effectes cannot poſſiblie bee
in vs, except the ſpirit of adoption
worke them. and therefore who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
hath them, hee hath an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
teſtimonie of his adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
from the verie ſpirit of adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
For this libertie, and effectes
of it, are not the worke of a mans
owne hart: but the work of Gods
ſpirit, in the heart: making it free,
&amp; cauſing it to reioyce, &amp; making
it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fident towards God, that this
may be cleere, we have to conſider
the eſtate of man, firſt, in ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
and blindnes, before he knewe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
God, or him ſelfe. Secondly,
his eſtate vnder the Lawe. And
laſtlie, his eſtate vnder grace tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:18605:25"/>
In the two former caſes, there is
nothing in mans heart, but blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
or the ſpirit of bondage, vnto
feare: yea even in the verie elect,
before they receyve this ſpirit of
Adoption and grace, by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell.</p>
            <p>In man by nature, as he is borne,
there is nothinge but blindnes, I
ſay nothing, not that I exclude
bondage: for in both the firſt two
eſtates of man, blindnes and bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
doe accompanie each other:
but in the firſt eſtate, blindnes ſo
reigneth, that bondage is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyved
nor felt. In the ſecond, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
blindnes be ſo farre taken
away, as man ſee and feele his bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage:
yet it is not ſo taken away,
that it hide not from him his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie
and freedome. Therefore in
the firſt he is the ſlave of blindnes
and darkneſſe: becauſe the power
thereof is predominant in him:
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:18605:25"/>
holding him in ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God,
of him ſelfe, of ſinne, and of true
righteouſnes. Therefore doth the
ſcripture ſay,<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 11</note> 
               <hi>There is none that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandeth,
there is none that ſeeketh
God.</hi> And the Apoſt. to the Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,
ſhewing the naturall eſtate
of man,<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 12.</note> declareth that he is <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Christ, an aliant from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
wealth of Iſrael, a ſtranger from
the covenant of promiſe, without hope,
and without God in the worlde.</hi> And
therefore ſpeakinge of the vaine
converſation of men naturall, hee
ſheweth the cauſes of it to be this,
<hi>becauſe they have their vnderſtanding

               <hi>for ye were once darknes,</hi>
meaning by nature: and therefore
they who are effectuallie called to
grace, are in that ſame place ſaide,
to be <hi>light in the Lord.</hi> And by the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:18605:26"/>
Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Pet. 2. 9.</note> are ſaid, <hi>to be called of
God out of darknes to his marveylous

               <note place="margin">1. Theſ. 5. 5.</note> And to the Theſſalonians,
they that are called, are ſaide, <hi>to be
of the day and of the light.</hi> And they
which are not called, are ſaide, to
<hi>be of the night, and of darknes.</hi> And
the Apoſtle to the Coloſſians (wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to ſhewe the force of darknes
in holding men in bondage) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes
their calling by GOD, in
theſe wordes:<note place="margin">Coloſ. 1. 13.</note> 
               <hi>who hath drawen vs
out vnder the power of darknes.</hi> So it
is manifeſt, that in our eſtate natu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rall,
wherein (as ſaith the Apoſtle
to the Galathians) <hi>wee knowe not
God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 8.</note> darknes hath power and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
over vs in ſuch ſorte, that
we have no libertie of minde, nor
body, to ſerve God: the minde
being kept in ignorance of God,
of righteouſnes and of ſinne. And
ſo conſequentlie, man in this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,
is without feare. Not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:18605:26"/>
he is not in danger, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
hee ſeeth not his danger.
Therefore alſo may he bee ſecure,
becauſe he is ſenſeleſſe: but confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
hee can not be, becauſe hee
hath no knowledge. It is true,
men in this caſe are commonly
moſt peart in ſinne, and bolde in
wickedneſſe, againſt GOD: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they know neither him, nor
them ſelves. And therefore, oft tymes,
as fooliſh flyes, they ruſh
vpon the candle: or blinde horſes
doe runne againſt the wall: but
bolde and confident in him, they
can not be, who knowes him not
in Chriſt. Therefore doth the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
declare that the cauſe why
ſuch men give themſelves to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſe,
<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 19.</note> is, becauſe they have no
feeling.</p>
            <p>Now in the ſecond eſtate, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Lawe, we are further from
libertie, and the remaynant bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:18605:27"/>
of the ſpirit of Adoptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For
albeit that ſome light ariſe in the
heart, by the Lawe: as the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of ſinne (conforme to that
of the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 7</note> 
               <hi>I knew not ſinne but
by the Law)</hi> yet this light, doeth
only reveyle to man his bondage:
but doth not remove nor remedie
it: becauſe that was impoſſible to
the Lawe, <hi>in as much as it was weak
becauſe of the fleſh,</hi> as ſaieth the ſame
Apoſtle.<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 3.</note> Therefore this light of
the Lawe, although it bee neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
yet it is comfortleſſe. For it
ſhewes firſt to man,<note place="margin">Ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 7. 14.</note> that he is <hi>ſolde
vnder ſinne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 10.</note> and that <hi>no good dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
in him.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 7. 10.</note> Heerevpon, it reveiles
vnto him, that hee is vnder the
curſe of God, and ſo that hee is
dead. Wherevpon it comes to
paſſe, that God therein is ſo terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to man, that hee cannot abyde
him, nor heare him, but is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
to runne from him: as is
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:18605:27"/>
cleere by the 12. chapt. of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brues,
verſe 19. 20. 21. compared
with Exod. chapt. 20. verſe 18. 19.
20. 21. Thus our former blindnes,
is turned into bondage, and the
fruit of blindnes, that is ſecuritie:
is turned in the fruit of bondage,
which is feare. Therefore the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie
of the Lawe, is called, the
miniſterie of death and condemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.</note> And in the firſt act of Gods
calling, the ſpirit that ſpeaketh in
the Lawe, and is given by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie
of the Lawe, is called the
ſpirit of bondage, vnto feare. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the ſight and knowledge of
our ſelves, and of God, which the
ſpirit gives vs by the Lawe,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 15</note> workes
theſe effectes. And therefore by
that name is diſtinguiſhed, from
the ſpirit of Adoption, which is
given by the Goſpell. and this will
the Apoſtle ſignifie to the Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,
when he (comparinge the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:18605:28"/>
two Teſtaments to the two, by
whom Abraham begot Iſmael &amp;
Iſaack) doeth ſhewe,<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 24.</note> that the one,
which is from Mount Sinai, doeth
beget vnto bondage.</p>
            <p>This being the eſtate of man,
both by nature and by the Lawe:
it is manifeſt, that theſe effectes of
the ſpirit, which witneſſe adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
are not in man, neither by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
neither by the Lawe. But
when the free ſpirit of the Lorde
commeth, then commeth libertie
to the heart. And this ſpirit of the
Lord (otherwayes called the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of promiſe) comes to vs by the
preaching of faith, and not of the
workes of the Lawe: as witneſſeth
the Apoſtle to the Galathians,<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 2. and 14.</note> and
the hiſtorie of the Actes of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles.<note place="margin">Act. 10. 44.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Nowe then, when the man,
(who firſt by nature, was vnder
blindnes: and next, by the Lawe,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:18605:28"/>
was vnder ſinne and death, kept
in bondage and feare) findes him
ſelfe, firſt delivered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
and ignorance of minde: and
next, from that bondage of ſinne
and death: and ſo conſequentlie
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his feare, which was wrought
in him by his bondage, then may
he knowe, that the ſpirit of adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
grace, and libertie, hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to his heart, and hath taken
poſſeſſion of it: becauſe he findes,
that promiſe acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſhed in him,
whereof Zacharias ſpeaketh, in the
Goſpell, according to Luke: to
wit; <hi>that God would grant to vs, that
we being delivered out of the handes
of our enemies,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 1. 74</note> 
               <hi>ſhould ſerve him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
feare, all the dayes of our life, in
holynes and righteouſnes before him.</hi>
For this was the ende of Chriſtes
death, ſayeth the Apoſtle to the
Hebrewes, to witt, <hi>that hee might
deliver all them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 2. 15</note> 
               <hi>who for feare of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:18605:29"/>
death,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 2. 15</note> 
               <hi>were all their life tyme ſubiect
to bondage.</hi> Thus therefore, the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
who can diſcerne in his hearte,
which once was filled with the
ſpirit of bondage vnto feare, the
ioyfull libertie of the ſonnes of
God: whereby hee that was the
bondman and ſeruant of ſinne, by
the Lawe, is now by the Goſpell,
made the free man of Chriſt, (the
bandes of iniquitie being broken)
and ſo freed, both from the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,
and alſo from the power of
ſinne: (being iuſtified by faith in
Ieſus Chriſt, and having grace, in
the ſuperabondance thereof; reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
through righteouſnes vnto
eternall life through Ieſus Chriſt
our Lord:<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 1. and 21.</note> even in the ſoule, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
ſinne in the abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dance thereof,
had reigned through vnrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
vnto death): this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I ſay, may
eaſilie diſcerne, the ſpirit, witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
his adoption, by this his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:18605:29"/>
from the ſlauerie of ſinne Firſt
in his iuſtification, next in his ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification:
and ſo conſequentlie
from the feare of death following
thereon. In place whereof, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds,
a ioye vnſpeakeable &amp; glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious:
the hart iuſtified, reioycing
in the hope of the glorie of God.
For this cauſe is it,<note place="margin">Pet. 1. 8.</note> that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
Peter, willeth vs by <hi>ioyning ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
to our faith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 2.</note> 
               <hi>and to vertue know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and to knowledge temperance,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 10</note>
&amp;c. to make our calling and elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſure. Becauſe our ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(being the worke of the ſpirit
of adoption) is a ſure ſeale of our
election. And therefore doeth the
Apoſtle Peter give this reaſon of
his threatning and rebuke againſt
<hi>Simon Magus,</hi> to wit, that albeit he
was baptiſed, yet the Apoſtle did
ſee, that he was in the gale of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe,
and in the band of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie:
wherein, <hi>Simon</hi> being ſtill
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:18605:30"/>
captive, could have no aſſurance
of adoption: albeit hee had out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
embraced the Goſpell:
and therefore is ſaid, to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved.
And becauſe this worke,
is the great worke of Chriſt, in the
elect, and chief ende of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming:
Therefore doeth the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
Eſaie deſcribe the worke of
his comming, and effect of the
ſpirit of the Lord in him, in theſe
wordes:<note place="margin">Eſa. 61. 1.</note> 
               <hi>The ſpirit of the Lorde is
vpon mee, the Lord hath annointed
me, that I ſhould preach the Goſpell to
the poore: that I ſhould heale the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
hearted: that I ſhould preach de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverie
to the captives, and receyvinge
of ſight to the blinde: that I ſhould ſet
at libertie them that are bruſed, and
that I ſhould preach the acceptable
yeare of the Lord: to appoint vnto
them that murne in Zion, and to give
vnto them beautie for aſhes, the oyle of
ioye for mourning, the garmentes of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:18605:30"/>
gladnes for the ſpirit of heavines, that
they might be called trees of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
the planting of the Lord.</hi> Which
Propheſie, Chriſt ſheweth to bee
fulfilled by him ſelfe in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell
accordinge to Luc. in the
which it is manifeſt, that the work
of the ſpirit,<note place="margin">Luk. 4. 18.</note> in preaching the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell,
is, to worke knowledge and
libertie, in making vs trees of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes,
planted by God: and by
libertie, to worke ioye and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
in place of mourning &amp; hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines.</p>
            <p>Therefore is it by good reaſon,
that the Apoſtle forbiddes vs, to
<hi>let ſinne reigne in our mortall bodies,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 12</note>
               <hi>that we ſhould obey it in the luſtes ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:</hi>
in reſpect wee are made free
from ſinne, in Chriſt: and are
made the ſervants of God: having
our fruit in holines. And alſo bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
vs <hi>reioyce alwayes in the Lord:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 4. 4.</note>
               <hi>for there is no condempnation to vs,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:18605:31"/>
that are in Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 1. 2.</note> 
               <hi>ſeeing we are freed
from the lawe of ſinne and death, by
the lawe of the ſpirit of life which is in
Christ Ieſus.</hi> This is then that great
effect of the ſpirit of Adoption, in
our heartes, whereby, as by a moſt
ſure teſtimonie, wee diſcerne, the
ſpirit ſealing our Adoption. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
this ſpirit of adoptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which
is given vs by the preaching of the
Goſpell, takes away, both theſe
miſeries: to witt, the blindnes,
wherein we are by nature, &amp; next
the bondage, reveiled by the law,
and feare cauſed thereby.</p>
            <p>Havinge thus ſpoken, of the
worke of the ſpirit, it followeth
that we conſider the voyce of the
ſpirit.</p>
            <p>This voyce of the ſpirit, is of
two ſortes. The firſt is, when the
ſpirit within vs, ſpeaketh to God
for vs. The ſecond is, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
in vs, ſpeaketh from God vnto
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:18605:31"/>
vs. The voice of the ſpirit to God,
is, when we by the ſpirit, call vpon
God as our Father. And this voice
of the ſpirit, is not only an evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
that we have the ſpirit, but alſo a
witnes of our Adoption: making
manifeſt vnto vs, that the ſpirit
hath wrought in vs, that worke of
libertie, whereof we have alreadie
ſpoken.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Touching the firſt, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,
in that, without the ſpirit, we
can not pray vnto God: as teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
the Apoſtle to the Romans,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 26</note>
               <hi>ſaying:</hi> The ſpirit alſo helpeth our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities:
for wee knowe not what to
pray as we cought: but the ſpirit it
ſelf, maketh request for vs with ſighes
that can not be expreſſed. <hi>Conforme
to this alſo doth the ſame Apoſtle
ſay in that ſame place,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 23</note> Wee alſo who
have the firſt fruites of the ſpirit, even
wee doe ſigh in our ſelves, waitinge
for the Adoption.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:18605:32"/>
And this is cleerly confirmed by
the words of the Prophet Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie:
<note place="margin">Zacha. 12. 10.</note> 
               <hi>In that day, ſayeth the Lord, I will
poure vpon the houſe of David, and
vpon the inhabitanes of Ieruſalem, the
ſpirit of grace and of compaſsion, and
they ſhall looke vpon me who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they have
pearched, and they ſhall lament for
him, &amp;c.</hi> The veritie of this point
may be ſhewed by the nature of
prayer: in which firſt it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that it be made vnto God. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
that it bee made in the
Name of Chriſt. Thirdly, that it
be made accordinge to the will of
God.</p>
            <p>Concerning the firſt, it cannot
be without the ſpirit: becauſe we
have no entrance nor acceſſe to
God in Chriſt, but by the ſpirit.
This is manifeſt by the Apoſtle,
ſaying:<note place="margin">Eph. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 18.</note> 
               <hi>For through him, wee both
have acceſſe to tbe Father, by one ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi>
Secondly, we can not pray in
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:18605:32"/>
the Name of Chriſt, except wee
acknowledge God his Father, and
in him our Father: which we can
never doe, except we be taught by
the ſpirit. For (as ſaieth the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle)
<hi>The ſpirit beareth witneſſe with
our ſpirit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 16.</note> 
               <hi>that we are the ſonnes of
God.</hi> Thirdly, no prayer can bee
made accordinge to the will of
God, but by the ſpirit: becauſe,
<hi>None knoweth the mynde of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> 
               <hi>but
the ſpirit of GOD.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 27.</note> According to
which the ſame Apoſtle ſayeth:
<hi>That he that ſearceth the heartes, kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
what is the meaning of the ſpirit.
For hee maketh interceſsion for the
Saincts, according to the will of God.</hi>
By all theſe it is plaine, that none
can pray which have not the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
For the babling of hypocrits,
is no prayer: ſeeing it proceedes
not from the ſpirit. And this is to
be vnderſtoode of all manner of
prayer. For all manner of prayer,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:18605:33"/>
be it confeſſion, petition, ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
or giving of thankes, muſt
ſtill be by the ſpirit. According to
the ſaying of the Apoſtle. <hi>And
pray alway in all maner of prayer and
ſupplication in the ſpirit.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ephe. 6. 18.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, this voyce of the
ſpirit is the witneſſe of our adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
and of the worke of our free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
in Chriſt. Which is evident
by the Apoſtle, Firſt, in that hee
ſayeth, <hi>That by this ſpirit we crye Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba
Father.</hi> And the ſame Apoſtle,
to witneſſe the ſame trueth, ſayeth
in another place: <hi>Becauſe yee are
ſonnes, God hath ſent foorth the ſpirit
of his ſonne into your heartes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 6.</note> 
               <hi>crying
Abba Father.</hi> Which crie of the
ſpirit can not bee in vs, vntill firſt
we be the ſonnes of God: ſeeing
this crye contayneth in it, a plaine
profeſſion of our Adoption, while
the ſpirit in vs, doth call vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God,
as our Father: and maketh vs call
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:18605:33"/>
vpon him, as our Father.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this is manifeſt by the
deſcription, which the Apoſtle
ſetteth downe, of the ſpirit, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we crye Abba Father:<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 15</note> 
               <hi>That it
is not the ſpirit of bondage vnto feare,
but the ſpirit of adoption.</hi> Which by
the contrarie, may be vnderſtood,
to comprehend freedome and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie.
According to the ſaying of
of the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 17.</note> 
               <hi>Where the ſpirit of
the Lord is, there is libertie</hi> For they
who live in darkneſſe, and in the
bandes of iniquitie, not yet made
partakers of the ioyfull libertie of
the ſonnes of God, can never with
boldnes approch to the throne of
grace, to call vpon GOD as their
Father Heerevpon it is that the
Scriptures abſolutely conclude,<note place="margin">Ioel. 2. 32.</note>
               <hi>That whoſoever ſhall call vpon the
Name of the Lord ſhall be ſaved.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 13.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Becauſe no man can call vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God,
vntill hee beleeve, that God is his
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:18605:34"/>
God, and he his ſonne in Chriſt:
according to the ſaying of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle,
<note place="margin">Rom. 10.</note> 
               <hi>How ſhall they call vpon him,
in whom they have not beleeved?</hi>
This ſheweth plainlie, that the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
crie, or our callinge vpon
God by the ſpirit, as out Father,
is a ſure teſtimonie of our Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and ſeale of our effectuall
calling. Therefore, vnder the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
vpon the Name of the Lord,
is oft ſet downe, the true and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
deſcription of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:
as namelie, to the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,
<hi>Vnto the Church of GOD
which is at Corinth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 1. 2</note> 
               <hi>with all that call
vpon the Name of the Lord IESVS
Christ in every place.</hi> And the ſame
Apoſtle ſheweth, that the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of God which remayneth

hath this ſeale, <hi>Let every one that
calleth vpon the Name of the Lord,</hi>

               <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from iniquitie.</hi> Declaring plain<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lie,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:18605:34"/>
that to call vpon the Name of
the Lord, is as much as to be one
of Gods elect children: which in
that ſame place is made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,
<note place="margin">2. Tim. 2. 22.</note> by this other ſentence, <hi>Follow
after righteouſnes faith, love and peace
with them that call vpon the Name of
the Lord with pure hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus wee are to take our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
or cryinge on the Name of
the Lorde, with boldnes, in that
confidence, and aſſruance which
faith bringeth, for a ſure teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
of the ſpirit of Adoption, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing
our heartes, and ſo of our
Adoption.</p>
            <p>The other voyce of the ſpirit, to
wit, when the ſpirit ſpeaketh from
God to vs, is likewiſe a moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lide,
firme, and infallible teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
of our Adoption. And this
ſorte of voyce, is that whereof the
Prophet ſpeaketh,<note place="margin">Eſay. 30. 21.</note> 
               <hi>And thine eare
ſhall heare the voyce of one behinde
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:18605:35"/>
thee, ſaying: This is the way, &amp;c.</hi> Of
the ſame doeth the Lord ſpeake in
another place, ſaying: <hi>I will allure
hir and bring hir in the wildernes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hoſ. 2. 14</note> 
               <hi>and
ſpeake kindly vnto hir.</hi> Which pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
are not onely to bee refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
to the Lords ſpeaking to his
Church, in the externall miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of his word: but are ſpeciallie
to be vnderſtoode, of the inwarde
working of God in the heart, by
his ſpirit. Of which ſorte of voyce
<hi>David</hi> ſpeaketh, when hee ſayeth
to the Lord,<note place="margin">Pſal. 51. 8.</note> 
               <hi>Let mee heare ioye and
gladneſſe, that the bones which thou
haſt broken, may reioyce.</hi> And this
ſorte of voyce is three folde, for it
conſiſteth eyther in Gods teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or in his confirminge of that
which he teacheth: or then in his
conforting of his children in their
afflictions. Of the firſt, that is his
teaching voyce, wee have ſpoken
before.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:18605:35"/>
For God by his ſpirit, ſpeakes
to vs, when inwardlie he openeth
our heartes, and maketh vs heare
his word of grace, and to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande
it, &amp; to receyve it. Of this
worke Chriſt ſpeaketh, when hee
ſayeth:<note place="margin">Io. 14. 26.</note> 
               <hi>But the Comforter which is
the holy ſpirit, whom the Father will
ſende in my Name, hee ſhall teach you
all things.</hi> Secondly, God is ſaid to
ſpeake vnto vs, by his ſpirit, when
hee confirmeth to vs, the thinge
which he hath ſpoken: and of this
wee have alſo ſpoken in generall.
And of this kinde of voyce ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
the Apoſtle in that place to
the Romanes,<note place="margin">Ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 8. 15.</note> ſayinge: <hi>The ſame
ſpirit heareth witneſſe with our ſpirit,
that wee are the ſonnes of God.</hi> Of
this confirmation, the ſame Apoſtle,
ſpeaketh to the Corinht. whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he ſaieth,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1. 6</note> 
               <hi>As the testimonie of Ieſus
Christ was confirmed in you.</hi> Which
wordes ſhewe the cleere evidence
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:18605:36"/>
of that two fould teſtimonie of
the ſpirit, whereof wee did ſpeake
before: The one, when God wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
his word in our hearts: which
heere is vnderſtood by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
of Chriſt. The other, when
he ſeales that which hee hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and in ſpeaking hath written
in our heartes: and that is here vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,
by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firming of the
teſtimonie of Ieſus in vs. And for
this work of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmation, the ſpirit
is called the earneſt &amp; ſeale of God</p>
            <p>And as God by his ſpirit ſealeth
and confirmeth all the promiſes in
Chriſt, and alſo all what hee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
hath wrought in vs accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the promiſe. So among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things, he ſpecially co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmeth
our Adoption, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſpirit bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
witneſſe to vs, that we are the
ſonnes of God. After that firſt he
hath effectuallie called vs by tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
vs and working faith in our
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:18605:36"/>
hearts, and alſo hath made our
hearts (now beleeving) ſpeake to
vs that we are ſonnes.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, God is ſaid to ſpeake
vnto vs by his ſpirit, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted
vs in our troubles: remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
by his ſpirit, the anguiſh and
grief of our hearts, &amp; reſtoring vs
to our wonted ioyes in him again.
Of which voyce of the ſpirit, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid
ſpeaketh whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he prayeth, <hi>Make
me heare ioy and gladneſſe.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 51. 8. 12.</note> And a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aine,
<hi>Reſtore me to the ioye of thy ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
and establiſh mee with thy free
ſpirit.</hi> For this worke the ſpirit is
called <hi>the Comforter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nowe wee come to the laſt
point: which is the principal thing
which yee demaund: and that is,
Howe wee ſhall diſcerne this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie
of the Lords ſpirit, from
the teſtimonie of our owne ſpirit.
And this is to bee done, eyther in
the time of peace, or trouble: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:18605:37"/>
it is more difficile in proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie,
to diſtinguiſh them.</p>
            <p>There is two voyces of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
as we have ſaide, which both
witneſſe our Adoption. The firſt,
when the ſpirit in vs, ſpeakes to
God.</p>
            <p>This teſtimonie of the ſpirit, is
diſcerned three wayes: The firſt
thing whereby we diſcerne, it is
the great heavines of heart and
ſorrowe which the conſcience of
ſinne breedeth in vs, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as ſaith
the Prophet) God having poured
vpon vs the ſpirit of grace and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion,
<hi>Wee looke vppon him whom
we have pea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Zach. 12. 10.</note> 
               <hi>and lament for him,
as men mourne for their onely begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
ſonne: and are ſorrie for him, as
men are for their firſt begotten childe.</hi>
Of this nature was the mourning
of Peter, after his deniall, when (as
ſayeth the holy ſcripture) <hi>hee went
out, and weeped bitterlie:</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:18605:37"/>
this is a ſure <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oken of ſaving
grace, therefore they that mourne
are compted bleſſed. This mour<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning
hath alwayes ioyned with it
an hunger &amp; thirſt for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.
For ther can be no true mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
for ſinne, where there is no
deſire of righteouſnes. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
this is the proper effect of
the ſpirit of grace in all and everie
one of thoſe who receyve him.
Therefore doeth the Lord by his
Prophet declare what ſhall be the
worke of the ſpirit of grace and
compaſſion in that day whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God
ſhall poure him out vpon his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
ſayinge:<note place="margin">Math. 26. 75.</note> 
               <hi>Then ſhall there bee
great mourning at Ieruſalem: like as
the lamentation of Adadrimmon in
the valey of Megiddon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 5. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In which
place mourning is attributed to
everie familie,<note place="margin">Zach. 12. 11.</note> to everie ſtate, and
everie perſon, and that apart by
them ſelves, to ſhewe that it is a
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:18605:38"/>
common effect wrought by the
ſpirit in all Gods children, &amp; that
vnfainedly.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing whereby we
diſcerne this teſtimonie of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
is the earneſt longing with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement
grones and ſighes in our
ſelves for to be with Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Of this voyce of the ſpirit the
Apoſtle ſpeaketh, when he ſayeth,
<hi>Wee alſo who have the first fruite of
the ſpirit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 23</note> 
               <hi>even wee ſigh in our ſelves,
wayting for the adoption.</hi> And in an
other place to the ſame effect hee
ſayeth, <hi>That wee ſigh, deſiring to bee
clothed vpon with our houſe which is
from heaven.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Cor. 5. 2</note> For certainly, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
diſpoſition of a man, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
bring forth this ſtronge deſire
of heaven, neither yet could the
renewed heart, beeing yet burde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with infirmitie and love of
this life, have ſo ſtrong a deſire of
removing from it, of it ſelfe, if the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:18605:38"/>
ſpirit did not worke it: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Apoſtle attributes theſe
ſighes for righteouſnes &amp; heaven,
to the ſpirit: and doth ſhewe vs,
that <hi>the ſpirit</hi> (in theſe cryes and
ſighes) <hi>helpeth our infirmities.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 26</note>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, this teſtimonie of the
ſpirit is diſcerned, by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fident
requeſtes and petitions it maketh
to God in vs, in the full aſſurance
of faith, without doubting: when
with boldnes, wee drawe neare
vnto the Throne of grace, crying
vpon God,<note place="margin">Phil. 4. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Abba Father: and in
all things making our petitions mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
to God,</hi> as ſayeth the Apoſtle.
For this confident boldnes of the
heart, towardes God, ſtill accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with reverence and feare,
cannot be in the heart, except the
ſpirit did worke it. For the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of a blind heart, wanteth both
aſſurance of Gods love, and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of his maieſtie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:18605:39"/>
But leaving this, wee come to
the diſcerning of the other voyce,
which more properly is called the
teſtimonie of the ſpirit: ſpeciallie
in that place to the Romans. And
that is, when God in vs, ſpeaketh
by his ſpirit vnto vs.</p>
            <p>This teſtimonie is to be diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
from the teſtimonie of our
hearte, three manner of wayes.
Firſt, in our firſt beleevinge. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
after wee have beleeved.
Thirdly, in the eclipſes of our faith,
and in our troubles.</p>
            <p>In our firſt beleeving, wee may
diſcerne the teſtimonie of Gods
ſpirit, from our owne, touchinge
our Adoption: becauſe our firſt
beleeving, is ever by the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
of the ſpirit, and not by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie
of our owne heart. For
our heart can never beare witnes
to vs, that wee are the ſonnes of
God, vntill firſt our heartes have
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:18605:39"/>
beleeved, that wee are his ſonnes.
and this our hearts can not do, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the ſpirit, have firſt wrought
this faith, by the worde, in our
hearts. Therefore, my firſt beliefe
and aſſurace of my Adoption, is
alwayes the teſtimonie of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God, and my owne hearts te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie,
muſt ſtill followe vpon
this: ſo that in mans hearte, the
voyce that maketh it firſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceyve
Gods love, and beleeve it, is the
ſpirits teſtimonie: which, when
the heart of man hath receyved,
then it ſpeaketh. For till it beleeve,
it can not ſpeake: according as it
is written:<note place="margin">Pſal. 116. 10.</note> 
               <hi>I have beleeved, and
therefore I have ſpoken.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Cor. 4. 13.</note> Thus then
is this teſtimonie firſt diſcerned:
when I diſcerne, the voyce of the
ſpirit, which I beleeve, from the
voyce of my ſpirit, now beleving,
and bearing witnes to me, of that,
which firſt, the ſpirit of God did
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:18605:40"/>
witnes to it.</p>
            <p>Secondlie, after we have belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
wee may alſo diſcerne the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie
of Gods ſpirit, from the
teſtimonie of our owne ſpirit, by
a plaine contrarie order. For in
the former, the ſpirites teſtimonie
did goe before, the teſtimonie of
our ſpirit: but heere, it followeth
after it: and is the confirmation of
it. So that, when after wee have
beleeved the ſpirit, ſpeakinge the
word vnto vs, and after that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
wee have ſpoken with our
owne ſpirit: if then wee heare a
new voyce, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firming that which
we beleeved, and which our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
did ſpeake: that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firming, ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and ſtabliſhing voyce, is the
teſtimonie of Gods ſpirit. Thus
wee muſt learne to diſcerne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
our beleeving, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of our belief: and ſo ſhal
wee know, the teſtimonie of Gods
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:18605:40"/>
ſpirit, from the teſtimonie of our
owne ſpirit. Therefore ſtill the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
Scriptures of God, diſtinguiſh
betwixt the worke of God, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
vs receyve the teſtimonie of
his ſpirit, and his worke, in confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
in vs, that teſtimonie nowe
receyved. And alſo teacheth vs, to
knowe the teſtimonie of our own
ſpirit (which commeth in betwixt
theſe two) to bee different, from
them both. Accordinge to this
working of God, the Saincts pray,
<hi>Stabliſh O God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 68. 28<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> 
               <hi>that which thou hast
wrought in vs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To ſpeake more plainly of this
point, there is a three folde voyce
in the heart that hath the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
of Ieſus confirmed in it. The
firſt is the voyce of God by his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
in the worde ſpeaking vnto
our hearts, and perſwading them
to beleeve that the promiſe belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
vnto vs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:18605:41"/>
The ſecond voyce is the voyce
of our hearts receyving the word
wherby it ſpeaketh that which the
ſpirit hath perſwaded, and this in
effect is nothing but the very faith
of the heart now actually working
in vs. Whereas the firſt was the
worke of the ſpirit working this
faith in vs: ſo that in this firſt act
we are patients, in the other we are
agentes: in the firſt we are ſpoken
too by the ſpirit of God, in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde,
our owne heartes ſpeaketh
in vs. The third voice is the voyce
of Gods ſpirit following the voyce
of our hearts ratifying it: and this
is nothing els but the confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our faith. So wee may ſee
that the Lord performeth twoo
workes in vs for our comfort: the
firſt is, the working of faith &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe:
the other is the confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the faith, which he him ſelfe
did work. But before his laſt work,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:18605:41"/>
our hearts having faith wrought
in them, doe worke by it, or wee
with our hearts worke: and this is
nothing but beleeving with the
heart, or the hearts beleevinge.
Wherevpon followeth the ſealing
of vs in that which it beleeveth,
that is, in the teſtimonie which
the beleeving heart giveth of him
in whom it is.</p>
            <p>Thirdlie, we diſcerne this teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
of the ſpirit, in our trouble:
when we find any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort, or peace
wrought in our hearts, when they
are troubled: or anie ioye, vpon
the aſſurance of Gods love. If wee
finde a quiet calmneſſe of minde,
with patience, meeknes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing
in tribulation, vpon anie
ſight or knowledge of our Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
all theſe are the vndoubted
teſtimonies of the ſpirit: who
ſhedding abroad the love of God
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:18605:42"/>
in our hearts, maketh vs to reioyce
in affliction: as the Apoſt. ſpeaketh
of the Hebrues,<note place="margin">Heb. 10.</note> 
               <hi>and ye ſuffered with
gladnes the ſpoyling of your goods,
knowing in your ſelves that yee have
in heaven a better, and an enduring
ſubstance.</hi> And touching the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
<note place="margin">Act. 5. 41.</note> it is ſaide, <hi>They departed reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
that they were compted worthie
to ſuffer for his Name.</hi> That this ioy,
is the work of the ſpirit, vpon the
teſtimonie of Gods love, is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
by the Apoſt. to the Romans,
where ſhewing the cauſe, why we
reioyce in afflictions, ſayth, <hi>Becauſe
of the love of God which is ſhed ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>road
in our heartes, by the holy ſpirit
which is given vs.</hi> According to
this grounde it is, that the Saints
are brought in, wayting what God
will ſpeake to them in trouble: as
namely in the Pſalme 85. verſ. 8.
<hi>I will hearken what the Lord will ſay,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:18605:42"/>
concerning mee: for hee ſhall ſpeake
peace vnto his people, and to his ſaints.</hi>
And the Prophet Habacuk in like
manner is brought in ſaying thus:
<hi>I will ſtande vpon my watch, and ſet
mee vpon the Towre, and will looke
and ſee what hee will ſay vnto mee.</hi>
Thus whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God ſpeaketh peace to
the Saincts in affliction, and quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
their thoughtes, and maketh
them heare ioye and gladnes, that
is the teſtimonie of the ſpirit of
the Lord, who is our onely Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter.
For as ſayeth the Prophet
David,<note place="margin">Pſal. 73. 25.</note> 
               <hi>My fleſh and my heart faileth:
but God is the ſtrength of my heart.</hi>
And therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> prayeth: <hi>O
ſatisfie vs with thy mercie, ſo ſhall wee
reioyce and be glad all our dayes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 90. 14. 15.</note> 
               <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
vs againe, &amp;c.</hi> We may hold it
for a moſt certaine trueth, that our
patient enduring of grievous tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls
ioyfully, the conſtant peace
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:18605:43"/>
of God in our hearts, in the tyme
when wee endure the enimitie of
the world: the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſolations, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
we are comforted, in all our
afflictions, are vndoubted teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of our Adoption, proceeding
all from Gods ſpirit.</p>
            <p>But all this is moſt cleerlie diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
when the teſtimonie of
Gods ſpirit, and the teſtimonie of
our ſpirit, are ſeperate the one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the other: &amp; when they are found
to ſpeake one againſt the other:
and to give two contrarie teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.
For while theſe two goe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and are not ſevered or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing:
it is oft tymes hard to
diſcerne the one from the other.
But if we can finde them ſeperate,
ſo that the one faile vs, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vphold vs, then may they
cleerly bee diſcerned. And this
commeth to paſſe, eyther when
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:18605:43"/>
God vpon the carnall preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our hearts, ſuffereth vs to
fall in ſome dangerous triall. or
then, when God him ſelfe ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to become our enemie: ſo
that the heart hath to wreſtle
with GOD him ſelfe, vnder the
ſenſe of his wrath, all former fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of his mercie then ceaſing.</p>
            <p>Of the firſt, wee have example
in Peter, whoſe heart ſaide vnto
him, that no danger could make
him forſake Chriſt the Lorde, to
make him know, that this was not
the teſtimonie of Gods ſpirit: but
a carnall confidence of his owne
heart, ſuffered him to be tried, and
in the triall to fall: and ſo to finde,
it was but his owne carnall heart,
that did beare witnes to him. God
oft tymes for this cauſe tryeth his
owne children: to make them
diſcerne, betwixt the confidence
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:18605:44"/>
and aſſurance which their owne
hearts giveth them, and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
and comfort which the
ſpirit of God worketh in them:
that they may not truſt in them
ſelves, or in their owne hearts, but
in the living God. This the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
witneſſeth to the Corinthians,
ſaying:<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 9</note> 
               <hi>He maekth vs to receyve the
ſentence of death in our ſelves, becauſe
we ſhould not trust in our ſelves but in
God which raiſeth the dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of the ſecond, wee have exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Iob.</hi> And this
diſcerning of the ſpirits teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
is two folde, one is by the
voyce of the ſpirit in vs, vnto God,
when our hearts ſpeake the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie.
The other is, by the voyce
of the ſpirit vnto vs, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our own
hearts ſaith otherwayes.</p>
            <p>Of the firſt <hi>David</hi> is an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
who in his proſperitie ſaide,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:18605:44"/>
               <hi>hee ſhould never bee moved:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 31. 2.</note> Yet
when God did hyde his face, his
heart fayled him: and he ſaide in
his haſte, <hi>I am caſt out of thy ſight.</hi>
and yet hee preſently addeth theſe
wordes: <hi>nevertheleſſe thou heardeſt
the voyce of my prayer.</hi> Heere wee
may perceyve <hi>Davids</hi> owne heart,
ſaying, hee was caſt out of Gods
ſight: but yet the ſpirit of GOD,
maketh requeſt vnto God for him,
and maketh him pray to God in
faith, as not reiected of God: and
the Lord did heare him. This him
ſelfe ſheweth plainlie, in an other
place,<note place="margin">Pſal. 116. 10.</note> when he ſayeth: <hi>I beleeved,
and therefore I ſpake: but I was ſore
troubled, I ſaide in my haſte, All men
are liers.</hi> At this time, <hi>David</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed
with the ſnares of death, &amp;
holden by the griefes of the grave,
finding trouble and heavines, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
the eſtate of his owne heart:
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:18605:45"/>
that it ſaid, that all men are liers:
and therefore he gathers this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,
that albeit his owne heart
did ſay, that Gods promiſe ſhould
not bee accompliſhed: yet doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
he behoved to have faith: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he prayed. For except hee
had beleeved, he had not ſpoken.
And what can bee more cleere, to
let vs ſee, Gods ſpirit bearing wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
that God hath not forſaken
vs, when our owne hearts ſay the
contrarie. Then when by witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
this, the ſpirit cauſeth vs, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the diſtruſt of our owne
hearts, to pray to God: eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> above
hope, yet vnder hope, truſting in
the Lord, as did Abraham. If we
examine our ſelves, what hath
bene the eſtate of our hearts, in the
like (or at leaſt in our greateſt
temptations) wee ſhall finde, that
many tymes, when our harts hath
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:18605:45"/>
ſpoken no comfort vnto vs: yet
the ſpirit of God, hath drawen
ſighes and cries to God, out of our
hearts: which alſo our God hath
heard moſt graciouſlie. Theſe
cries are teſtimonies of the ſpirit,
witneſſing to vs, that wee are the
ſonnes of God: when as they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from vs, our hearts ſaying the
contrarie.</p>
            <p>Of the ſecond kinde of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
voyce, in ſpeaking from God
vnto vs: wee have likewiſe exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in <hi>David,</hi> when his owne heart
ſaid vnto God,<note place="margin">Pſal. 42.</note> 
               <hi>Why hast thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
me?</hi> Behold an other voyce
ſpeakinge vnto his heart in that
ſame tyme, <hi>Why art thou vexed O
my ſoule, and why art thou ſo diſquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
within mee? O put thy trust in
God, for I will yet give him thankes, he
is my helpe and my God.</hi> Heere the
heart ſpeaking no comfort, but
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:18605:46"/>
being wholy diſcouraged, and caſt
downe: the ſpirit of God in that
ſame heart, ſpeaketh to the heart,
and comforteth it, with this, that
God was his God. Nowe, that
theſe conſolations are the worke
and teſtimonie of Gods ſpirit, it
appeareth by that reaſon, which
David giveth, when hee boaſteth
in ſtrong co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence, that although
hee ſhould walke through the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
of the ſhadowe of death, yet
would hee feare none evill, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
<note place="margin">Pſal. 23.</note> 
               <hi>For thou art with mee, thy rod
and thy ſtaffe they comfort mee.</hi> By
theſe wordes declaring, that the
experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce he had of the comfort,
which Gods ſpirit did miniſter vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, in his moſt deſperate trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
paſt, even then when his
owne ſpirit did faile him, was the
ground of al his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence againſt
all future trialls.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:18605:46"/>
Wee have an example alſo of
this in <hi>Iob.</hi> Who when his owne
heart reaſoned, that God had hid
his face from him, and taken him
for his enemie: yet hee ſaith, <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
hee ſlaye mee, yet will I trust in
him, hee ſhalbe my ſalvation.</hi> Heere
two different ſpeeces in one heart:
the one from the ſpirit of <hi>Iob:</hi> the
other from the ſpirit of the Lord
in <hi>Iob.</hi> The one, perſwading that
God was his ſalvation, when the
other ſaide, God had hid his face
from him.</p>
            <p>Thus if wee would cleerlie diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne,
the teſtimonie of Gods ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
from the teſtimonie of our
owne ſpirit, let vs beholde our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves,
when God tryeth vs, rather
then when he maketh our moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
to ſtande ſtronge. or when
hee doeth wreſtle with vs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
as he did with <hi>Iacob:</hi> and in
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:18605:47"/>
ſeeminge to fight againſt vs, yet
doeth ſuſtaine vs, by his owne
ſtrength in vs, when our ſtrength
faileth vs.</p>
            <p>Thus I have as diſtinctlie as I
could, and therefore ſomewhat
more largelie, then an epiſtle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
requireth, given you ſuch ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
to your queſtion, as it
hath pleaſed the Lorde to grant
me light. If you finde any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
thereby, you ſhall thank God
for it: And what is wanting in it,
for your full ſatisfaction in this
matter, the Lord ſhall ſupplie it by
his owne ſpirit: or by that ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie
of grace, which hee hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
vnto others his ſervants, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he ſhall raiſe vp to write more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
of this matter: for the edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his Saints, in this and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thinges, I pray the Lord to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:18605:47"/>
give you and vs all, his everlaſting
peace through Chriſt IESVS
our Saviour, reveyling more and
more the myſterie of godlineſſe
in your hearts, and makinge you
abound in all knowledge with
faith, feeling, and ioy of the holy
Ghoſt. The grace of the
Lord <hi>IESVS</hi> bee with
you, and all the
Brethren,
<hi>AMEN.</hi>
