         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

make good, by the evidence of the fact,
joyned with their owne confeſsions. And
becauſe to wave the imputation of violent
intruſion, into the <hi>dominion</hi> of another,
they lay ſome claime, and pretend ſome
title unto it. I ſhall briefely ſhew how it
is contrary to the expreſſe termes <hi>of the
<pb facs="tcp:155835:3"/>
Great Charter of heaven,</hi> to have any ſuch
power, introduced amongſt men: Your
knowne Love to truth, and the Goſpel
of Chriſt, makes it altogether needleſſe
for me, to ſtirre you up by any motives, to
hearken to this juſt Complaint, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
a timely remedy for this growing

as the maine Columnes and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders
of any <hi>State,</hi> or <hi>Common-wealth;</hi>
like two pillars in a building, whereof the
one cannot ſtand, without the other; nor

ayding each other, and both ayming at

ſo they, without repugnancie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre,
and ſweetely fall in, one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for the reiglement and direction, of

<pb facs="tcp:155835:4"/>
where they are <hi>both thus united, there,</hi> and
onely there, is the bleſsing, in aſſurance
whereof, <hi>Hezekiah</hi> rejoyced: <hi>Truth</hi> and
<hi>Peace.</hi> An agreement without Truth, is
no <hi>Peace,</hi> but a covenant with <hi>Death,</hi> a

Schiſmes, and factions in the <hi>Church,</hi> and
the diviſions of the <hi>Church,</hi> are too often,
even the ſubverſions of the <hi>Common-wealth.</hi>
Thus it hath beene ever ſince that unhappy
difference, betweene <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel:</hi> which
was not, concerning the bounds and limits
of their inheritance, nor which of them
ſhould be heire to the whole world: but
about the <hi>Dictates of Religion,</hi> the offering

meeting with the ſtrong holds of Satan, and the
depraved corruption of humane nature, muſt

endeavour,</hi> I would willingly premoniſh thee of.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Never were ſo many <hi>prodigious errours</hi> introduced into a
<hi>Church,</hi> with ſo high a hand, and <hi>ſo little oppoſition,</hi> as theſe into
ours, ſince the nation of Chriſtians was known in the world, the chiefe
<hi>cauſe</hi> I take to be, that which <hi>Aeneas Sylvius</hi> gave, why more main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the <hi>Pope</hi> to be above the <hi>Councel,</hi> then the <hi>Councel</hi> above the
<hi>Pope,</hi> becauſe Popes gave <hi>Archbiſhopricks, Biſhopricks, &amp;c.</hi> but
the Councels ſued <hi>in forma pauperis,</hi> and therefore could ſcarſe get
<hi>an Advocate</hi> to plead their cauſe: the fates of our <hi>Church</hi> having of
late devolved the government thereof into the hands of <hi>men tainted
with this poyſon, Arminianiſme</hi> became backed, with the powerfull
Arguments, <hi>of praiſe and preferment,</hi> and quickly prevailed, to beat
<hi>poore naked truth into a corner:</hi> It is high time then for all the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of <hi>the old way,</hi> to oppoſe this innovation, prevailing by ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
means, before our breach grow great like the Sea, and there
be none to heale it.</p>
            <p>My intention in this weake indeavour, (which is but the undige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
iſſue of a few broken houres, too many cauſes in theſe furious ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
dayes, continually interrupting the courſe of my ſtudies) is
but to ſtirre up ſuch, who having <hi>more leaſure,</hi> and <hi>greater abilities,</hi>
will not as yet move a finger, to help vindicate oppreſſed Truth.</p>
            <p>In the meane time I hope this <hi>diſcovery</hi> may not be <hi>unuſefull,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
to ſuch who wanting either, <hi>will or abilities,</hi> to peruſe larger
diſcourſes, may yet be allured by their <hi>words</hi> which are ſmoother then
oyle, to taſt the <hi>poyſon of Aſpes</hi> that is under their lips: Satan hath
<gap reason="foreign">

his <hi>lies:</hi> and never did any of his <hi>Emiſſaries</hi> employ his received ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents
with more <hi>skill and diligence,</hi> then our <hi>Arminians:</hi> labouring
earneſtly in the firſt place to in ſtill ſome errors that are moſt <hi>plauſible,</hi>
intending chiefly an introduction of them that are more <hi>palpable,</hi>
knowing that if thoſe be for a time ſuppreſſed, untill theſe be well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted,
they will follow of their owne accord: wherefore I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured,
to lay open to the view of all, ſome of their foundation errors,
not uſually diſcuſſed, on which the whole inconſiſtent ſuperſtructure is
erected, whereby it will appeare, how under a moſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ine pretence of
furthering Piety, they have prevaricated againſt the very <hi>grounds of
Chriſtianitie:</hi> wherein</p>
            <p>Firſt, I have not obſerved the ſame method in handling each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Controverſie, but followed ſuch ſeverall waies as ſeemed moſt
convenient to cleere the truth and diſcover their hereſies:</p>
            <p>Secondly ſome of their errors I have not touched at all, as thoſe
concerning <hi>univerſall grace, juſtification,</hi> the <hi>finall Apoſtacy of true
beleevers:</hi> becauſe they came not within the compaſſe of my propoſed
method, as you may ſee <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. where you have the ſumme of the
whole diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I have given ſome inſtances, of their oppoſing the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Doctrine of <hi>the Church of England,</hi> contained in divers of the
39. Articles: which would it did not yeeld us iuſt cauſe of further com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint,
againſt the iniquitie of thoſe times whereinto we were lately
fallen: Had a <hi>poor Puritan</hi> offended againſt halfe ſo many <hi>Canons,</hi> as
they oppoſed <hi>Articles,</hi> he had forfeited his livelihood, if not endangered
his life: I would I could heare any other probable reaſon, why <hi>divers
Prelates</hi> were ſo zealous for the diſcipline, and ſo negligent of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Church: but becauſe the one was reformed by the word
of God: the other remaining as we found it in the times of Popery.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, I have not purpoſely undertaken to anſwer any of their
Arguments, referring that labour to a further deſigne: even a
clearing of our <hi>Doctrine of reprobation,</hi> and of the <hi>adminiſtration
of Gods providence, towards the Reprobates and over all their
actions,</hi> from thoſe calumnious aſperſions they caſt upon it, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this, I feare the diſcouragements of theſe wofull dayes, will
leave me nothing but a deſire: that ſo neceſſary a worke, may finde a
more able Pen:</p>

diſpoſing of things in this world, ought to be aſcribed to God,
or man: men for the moſt part have vindicated this prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,
unto themſelves, by exclamations, that ſo it muſt be, or
elſe, that God is unjuſt, and his waies unequall: never did any
men <hi>poſtquam Chriſtiana gens eſſe caepit:</hi> more eagerly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour

blinded Patrons of humane ſelfe-ſufficiencie; All whoſe innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in the received doctrine of the reformed Churches, aime at,
and tend to, one of theſe two ends.</p>
               <p>Firſt, to exempt themſelves from Gods juriſdiction, to free
themſelves from the ſupreme dominion of his all-ruling provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
not to live, and move, in him: but to have an abſolute in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
power, in all their actions, ſo that the event of all
things, wherein they have any intereſt, might have a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
relation, to nothing, but chance, contingencie, and their
owne wils; a moſt nefarious, ſacrilegious attempt: to this
end.</p>
               <p>Firſt, they deny the eternitie, and unchangeableneſſe of Gods
decrees: for thoſe being eſtabliſhed, they feare, they ſhould be
kept within bounds, from doing any thing, but what his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
hath determined ſhould be done, if the purpoſes of the ſtrength
of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> be eternall, and immutable, their idoll Free-will, muſt
be limited, their independencie prejudiced: wherefore, they
chuſe rather to affirme, that his decrees, are temporary and
changeable, yea that he doth really change them, according to
the ſeverall mutations he ſees in us: which how a wild a conceit
it is, how contrary to the pure nature of God, how deſtructive
to his attributes: I ſhall ſhew in the ſecond Chapter.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they queſtion the praeſcience, or foreknowledge of
God: for if knowne unto God, are all his workes, from the
beginning, if he certainely foreknow all things, that ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
come to paſſe, it ſeemes to caſt an infallibilitie of event, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all their actions, which encroaches upon the large territory,
of their new goddeſſe contingencie, nay it would quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne
the Queene of heaven, and induce a kinde of neceſſitie,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:155835:10"/>
of our doing all, and nothing but, what God foreknows: now that
to deny this praeſcience is deſtructive to the very eſſence of the
Deitie, and plain atheiſme, ſhall be declared, Chapter the third.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they depoſe the all-governing providence of this
King of Nations, denying its energeticall, effectuall power, in
turning the hearts, ruling the thoughts, determining the wils,
and diſpoſing the actions of men, by granting nothing unto it,
but a generall power, and influence, to be limited, and uſed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the inclination, and will of every particular agent: ſo
making Almighty God a deſirer, that many things, were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
then they are, and an idle ſpectator of moſt things that are
done in the world, the falſeneſſe of which aſſertions ſhall be
proved: Chapter the fourth.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, they denie the irreſiſtibilitie, and uncontrolable
power of Gods will, affirming, that oftentimes he ſeriouſly
willeth, and intendeth what he cannot accompliſh, and ſo is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
of his ayme: nay whereas he deſireth, and really intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
to ſave every man, it is wholly in their owne power whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he ſhall ſave, any one or no, otherwiſe, their Idol Free-will,
ſhould have but a poore deitie, if God, could how, and when, he
would, croſſe and reſiſt him, in his dominion: concerning this ſee
Chapter the fifth. <hi>His gradibus itur in coelum,</hi> corrupted nature,
is ſtill readie, either nefariouſly with <hi>Adam,</hi> to attempt to be
like God,<note place="margin">Pſal. 50.</note> or to thinke fooliſhly, that he is altogether like unto
us: one of which inconveniences, all men runne into, who have
not learned, to ſubmit their fraile wils, to the Almightie will of
God, and captivate their underſtandings, to the obedience of faith.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the ſecond end, at which the new doctrine of the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians</hi>
aimeth, is to cleere humane nature, from the heavie im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
of being ſinfull, corrupted, wiſe to doe evill, but unable
to doe good: and ſo to vindicate unto themſelves, a power, and
abilitie, of doing all that good, which God can juſtly require to
be done, by them, in the ſtate wherein they are, of making
themſelves, differ from other, who will not make ſo good uſe,
of the endowments of their natures, that ſo the firſt, and chiefeſt
part, in the worke of their ſalvation, may be aſcribed unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
a proud Luciferian endeavour; to this end:</p>
               <p>Firſt, they deny, that doctrine of predeſtination, whereby God
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:155835:11"/>
is affirmed, to have choſen certaine men, before the foundation
of the world, that they ſhould be holy, and obtaine everlaſting life,
by the merit of Chriſt, to the praiſe of his glorious grace: any
ſuch predeſtination which may be the fountaine, and cauſe of
grace, or glory, determining the perſons, according to Gods good
pleaſure, on whom they ſhall be, beſtowed: for this doctrine,
would make the ſpeciall grace of God, to be the ſole cauſe, of all
the good, that is in the elect, more then the reprobates, would
make faith, the worke, and gift of God: with divers other things,
which would ſhew their Idol to be nothing, of no value: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
what a corrupt hereſie they have ſubſtitute into the place
hereof, ſee Chapter the ſixth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they denie originall ſinne, and its demerit, which
being rightly underſtood, would eaſily demonſtrate, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,
all the labour, of the Smith, the Carpenter, and the
Painter, yet their Idol, is of its owne nature, but an unprofitable
blocke, it will diſcover, not onely the impotencie of doing good,
which is in our nature, but ſhew alſo, whence we have it: ſee
Chapter the ſeventh.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if ye will charge our humane nature, with a repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancie
to the Law of God, they will maintaine, that it was alſo
in <hi>Adam,</hi> when he was firſt created, and ſo comes from God
himſelfe: Chapter the eighth.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, they denie the efficacie, of the merit, of the death
of Chriſt, both, that God intended by his death, to redeeme his
Church, or to acquire unto himſelfe, an holy people, as alſo, that
Chriſt by his death, hath merited, and procured for us, grace,
faith, or righteouſneſſe, and power to obey God, in fulfilling the
condition of the new covenant; nay this were plainely to ſet up
an Arke, to breake their Dagons necke: for what praiſe (ſay
they) can be due, to our ſelves, for beleeving, if the blood of
Chriſt, hath procured God to beſtow faith, upon us: <hi>increpet te
Deus ô Satan,</hi> ſee Chapter nine and ten.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, if Chriſt will claime ſuch a ſhare in ſaving of his people,
of them that beleeve in him, they will grant, ſome to have ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
quite without him, that never heard, ſo much as a report, of
a Saviour: and indeed in nothing, doe they advance their Idol,
neerer the throne of God, then in this blaſphemie, Chapter 11.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:155835:11"/>
Sixthly, having thus robbed God, Chriſt, and his grace, they
adorne their Idol Free-will, with many glorious properties, no
way due unto it, diſcuſſed, Chapter 12. where you ſhall finde
how, <hi>movet cornicula riſum, furtivis undata coloribus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seventhly, they doe not onely claime, to their new made
Deitie, a ſaving power, but alſo affirme, that he is very active,
and operative in the great worke of ſaving our ſoules.</p>
               <p>Firſt, in fitly preparing us for the grace of God, and ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
of our ſelves, that it becomes due unto us: Chapter 13.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in the effectuall working of our converſion, together
with it: Chapter 14.</p>
               <p>And ſo at length with much toyle, and labour, they have placed
an Altar for their Idol, in the holy temple, on the right hand of
the Altar of God: and on it, offer ſacrifice, to their owne net,
and dragge; at leaſt <hi>nec Deo, nec libero Arbitrie, ſed dividatur:</hi>
not all to God, nor all to Free-will, but let the Sacrifice of praiſe,
for all good things, be divided betweene them.</p>

all, or any thing, which they oppoſe, but onely, of things free

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:155835:17"/>
their cauſes; ſome neceſſarily, ſome freely, ſome caſually, or
contingently, yet all ſo, as having a certaine futurition from his

affirme,) he can have at beſt but a conjecturall fore-knowledge,

this kinde of Atheiſme be tolerable among Chriſtians or no,

               <p>Firſt: it is laid downe, as a firme foundation: that knowne
unto God, are all his workes, from the beginning of the world,
<hi>Acts</hi> 15. 18. Every thing then, that in any reſpect may be
called his worke, is knowne unto him from all eternitie: now,
what in the world, if we may ſpeake as he hath taught us, can be
exempted from this denomination? even actions in themſelves
ſinfull; are not; though not as ſinfull, yet in ſome other regard,
as puniſhments of others; Behold, ſaith <hi>Nathan,</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> (in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:155835:19"/>
the name of God) <hi>I will take thy wives before thine eies, and give
them unto thy neighbour, and he ſhall lie with thy wives, in the ſight
of this ſunne: for thou diddeſt it ſecretly, but I will doe this thing
before all Iſrael: 2 Sam. 12, v.</hi> 11, 12. So alſo, when wicked
robbers had nefariouſly ſpoyled <hi>Job</hi> of all his ſubſtance; the holy
man concludeth, <hi>The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away:
Job</hi> 1. 1. Now, if the working of Gods providence be ſo mighty,
and effectuall, even in, and over thoſe actions, wherein the devil,
and men, doe moſt maliciouſly offend, as did <hi>Abſolom,</hi> and the
<hi>Sabean,</hi> with the <hi>Caldean</hi> theeves, that it may be ſaid to be his

notwithſtanding theſe two hinderances, Firſt, that they were
contingent, wrought by free agents, working according to ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

in the agents, had yet their dependance on his purpoſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate
counſell; ſurely, he hath an intereſt of operation in
the acts of every creature; but his workes, as it appeares before,

to wit; <hi>That God knoweth all ſecrets, and revealeth hidden things:
he ſearcheth the reines, and the heart: he knoweth the number of

thoſe things wherein her greateſt power is imagined
to conſiſt, are directly aſcribed unto God: <hi>as our words the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer

his piercing eye runne through, to foreſee the crowning of
<hi>Heſter,</hi> for the deliverance of his people: In a word; <hi>knowne un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God are all his workes:</hi> now what can poſſibly be imagined to
be more contingent, <hi>then the killing of a man by the fall of an axe
from out of his hand,</hi> who intended no ſuch thing; yet this God
aſſumeth as his owne work: <hi>Exod. 21. 13. Deut. 9. v.</hi> 4, 5. and
ſo ſurely was by him foreknowne.</p>
               <p>Fourthly: Do but conſider the propheſies in Scripture; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
thoſe concerning our Saviour, how many free and contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
actions did concurre for the fulfilling of them: as <hi>Iſa. 7. v. 14.

which though in regard of Gods praeſcience, it was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly

               <p>Divers other reaſons and teſtimonies might be produced to

notwithſtanding <hi>Epiſcopius</hi> blaſphemy, that it ſerves for nought

temptations, under whoſe preſſure, we ſhould elſe faint and

can ſuffer nothing, but what his hand and counſell guide unto us:

been the ſubject of the former Chapters, the latter only now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth

               <p>This then we may conceive, as an <hi>ineffable act or worke of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie

               <p>The providence of God in governing the world, is plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
made knowne unto us, both by his works, and by his word. I
will give a few inſtances of either ſort. 1. in generall, that the
Almightie <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and framer of this whole univerſe, ſhould
propoſe unto himſelfe no end in the creation of all things: that
he ſhould want either power, goodneſſe, will, or wiſdome, to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and diſpoſe the works of his own hands is altogether impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.
2. Take a particular inſtance, in one concerning accident,
the knowledge whereof by ſome means or other, in ſome degree
or other hath ſpread it ſelfe throughout the world: and that is that
almoſt univerſall deſtruction of all by the flood, whereby the
whole world was well-nigh reduced to its primitive confuſion,
is there nothing but chance to be ſeene in this? was there any
circumſtance about it that did not ſhow a God, and his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence?
not to ſpeake of thoſe revelations, whereby God fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
that he would bring ſuch a deluge: what chance for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
could collect, ſuch a ſmall number of individuals of all
ſorts, wherein the whole kinde might be preſerved? what hand
guided that poor veſſell from the rocks, and gave it a reſting place
on the mountains? certainly, the very reading of that ſtory, <hi>Gen.</hi>

of gubernation by his providence; as yet knows no end: yea,
and divers particular things he doth, beſides the ordinary courſe,
only to make known <hi>that he thus worketh, Ioh.</hi> 9. 3. as he hath
framed all things by his wiſdome, ſo he continueth them, by his
providence in excellent order; as is at large declared in that gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. and this is not bounded to any particular places,
or things, but <hi>his eyes are in every place beholding the evill, and the
good, Prov. 15. 3. ſo that none can hide himſelfe, in ſecret places,
that he ſhall not ſee him: Ierem. 23. 24. Acts 17. 24. Iob 5. 10, 11.
Exod.</hi> 4. 11. and all this he ſaith, that men may know <hi>from the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of the Sun, and from the Weſt, that there is none beſides him,
he is the Lord, and there is none elſe, he formeth the light, and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
darkneſſe, he maketh peace, and createth evill, he doth all theſe
things, Iſaiah</hi> 45. 7. in theſe and innumerable like places, doth the
Lord declare that there is nothing which he hath made, that with
the good hand of his providence he doth not govern and ſuſtaine.</p>
               <p>Now, this generall extent of his common providence to all,
doth no way hinder, but that he may exerciſe certaine ſpeciall
acts thereof, towards ſome in particular: even by how much nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
then other things they approach unto him, and are more aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milated
unto his goodneſſe. I meane his Church here on earth,
and thoſe whereof it doth conſiſt: <hi>for what nation is there ſo
great that hath God ſo nigh unto them,</hi> Deut. 4. 7. in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
hereof he moſt eminently ſheweth his glory, and exerciſeth
his power; joyne here his works, with his word, what he hath
done, with what he hath promiſed to doe for the conſervation of
his Church, and people, and you will finde admirable iſſues of a
more ſpeciall providence: againſt this he promiſeth, <hi>the gates of
hell ſhall not prevaile:</hi> Mat. 16. 18. amiddeſt <hi>of thoſe he hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to remaine,</hi> Matth. 18. 20. ſupplying them with an addition of
<hi>all things neceſſary,</hi> Matth. 6. 33. deſiring, <hi>that all their care might

4. 6, 7. ſure it is not troubleſome to God to take notice of all that
he hath created: did he uſe that great power in the production,
of the leaſt of his creatures, ſo farre beyond the united activitie of
men and Angels, for no end at all? doubtleſſe even they alſo muſt
have a well diſpoſed order, for the manifeſtation of his glory, <hi>not
a ſparrow falls to the ground, without our Father:</hi> Matth. 10. 29,
30. <hi>even the haires of our head are numbred, he cleatheth the lillies
and graſſe of the field which is to be caſt into the even, Luke</hi> 12. 27,
28. Behold his knowledge, and care of them, again he uſed frogs,
and lice, for the puniſhment of the Egyptians, <hi>Exod.</hi> 8. with a
gourd, and a worme he exerciſed his ſervant <hi>Ionah: Chap.</hi> 3. yea
he cals the locuſts <hi>his terrible Army,</hi> and ſhall not God know and

               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:155835:24"/>
That God by his providence governeth and diſpoſeth of all
things by him created, is ſufficiently proved; the manner how
he worketh all in all, how he ordereth the works of his owne
hands, in what this governing and diſpoſing of his creatures doth
chiefly conſiſt, comes now to be conſidered. And here foure
things are principally to be obſerved: Firſt, the ſuſtaining, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
and upholding of all things by his power. For <hi>he uphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
all things by the word of his power: Heb.</hi> 1. 3. Secondly, his
working together with all things, by an influence of cauſalitie, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the agents themſelves, <hi>for he alſo hath wrought all our works in
us: Iſaiah</hi> 26. 12. Thirdly, his powerfull over-ruling of all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents,
both neceſſary, free, and contingent, and diſpoſing of them
to certaine ends for the manifeſtation of his glory: So <hi>Ioſeph</hi> tels
his brethren, <hi>as for you, you thought evill againſt me, but God
meant it unto good, to bring to paſſe, as it is at this day, to ſave much
people alive,</hi> Gen. 50. 20. Fourthly, his determining and reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſecond cauſes to ſuch and ſuch effects: <hi>even the Kings heart
is in the hand of the Lord, as the rivers of water, he turneth it whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſoever he will,</hi> Prov. 21. 1.</p>
               <p>Firſt, his ſuſtentation or upholding of all things, is his power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
continuing of their being, naturall ſtrength and faculties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
on them at their creation; <hi>In him we live, and move, and
have our being: Acts</hi> 17. So that he doth neither worke all him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
in them, without any cooperation of theirs, which would
not only turn all things into ſtocks, yea and take from ſtocks, their
own proper nature, but alſo is contrary to that generall bleſſing
he ſpread over the face of the whole world, in the beginning, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rem. apol. cap. 6.</note>
                  <hi>and multiply: Gen.</hi> 1. 22. nor yet, leave them to a ſelfe
ſubſiſtance, he in the meane time only not deſtroying them,
which would make him an idle ſpectator of moſt things in the
world, not to worke hitherto as our Saviour ſpeaks: and grant to
divers things here below, an abſolute being, not derivative from
him; the firſt whereof is blaſphemous, the latter impoſſible.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for Gods working in, and together with all ſecond
cauſes, for the producing of their effects: what part or portion
in the worke, punctually to aſſigne unto him, what to the power
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:155835:24"/>
of the inferiour cauſes, ſeemes beyond the reach of mortals, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is an exact comprehenſion thereof, any way neceſſary, ſo that
we make every thing beholding to his power for its being, and
to his aſſiſtance for its operation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, his ſupreame dominion, exerciſeth it ſelfe in diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of all things, to certaine and determinate ends for his owne
glory: and is chiefly diſcerned, advancing it ſelf over thoſe things
which are moſt contingent: and making them in ſome ſort ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
inaſmuch as they are certainly diſpoſed of to ſome propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
ends: betweene the birth and death of a man, how many
things meerely contingent doe occurre? how many chances;
how many diſeaſes, in their owne nature all evitable; and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the event not one of them but to ſome prove mortall: yet
certaine it is, that a mans <hi>dayes are determined, the number of his
moneths are with the Lord, he hath appointed his bounds which he
cannot paſſe:</hi> Iob 14. 5. And oftentimes by things purely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent
and accidentall, he executeth his purpoſes, beſtoweth
rewards, inflicteth puniſhments, and accompliſheth his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
as when he delivereth a man to be ſlaine by the head of
an axe, flying from the helve in the hand of a man cutting a tree
by the way: but in nothing is this more evident, then in the
ancient caſting of lots, a thing as caſuall and accidentall as can be
imagined, hudled in the Cap at a venture; yet God overruleth
them to the declaring of his purpoſe, freeing truth from doubts,
and manifeſtation of his power, <hi>Prov. 16. 33. The lot is caſt into
the lap, but the whole diſpoſing of it is from the Lord:</hi> as you may
ſee in the examples of <hi>Achan: Ioſh. 7. 16, 17. Saul, 1 Sam. 10.
21. Ionathan, 1 Sam. 14. 41. Ionah, chap. 1. 8. Matthias, Act.</hi>
1. 26. And yet this overruling act of Gods providence, (as no
other decree or act of his) doth not rob things contingent of their
proper nature: for cannot he who effectually cauſeth that they
ſhall come to paſſe, cauſe alſo that they ſhall come to paſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingently.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Gods predetermination of ſecond cauſes, (which
I name not laſt as though it were the laſt act of Gods providence
about his creatures, for indeed it is the firſt that concerneth their
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:155835:25"/>
operation:) is that effectuall working of his, according to his
eternall purpoſe, whereby though ſome agents, as the wils of
men, are cauſes moſt free and indefinite, or unlimited Lords of
their owne actions, in reſpect of their internall principle of ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
that is their owne nature, are yet all in reſpect of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,
and by his powerfull working determined to this or that
effect, in particular: not that they are compelled to doe this, or
hindered from doing that; but are inclined and diſpoſed to doe
this or that, according to their proper manner of working, that is
moſt freely: For truly ſuch teſtimonies are every where obvious
in Scripture, of the ſtirring up of mens wils and minds, of bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and inclining them to divers things: of the governing of the
ſecret thoughts and motions of the heart; as cannot by any means
be referred to a naked permiſſion, with a government of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
actions, or to a generall influence, whereby they ſhould have
power to doe this or that, or any thing elſe, wherein as ſome ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
his whole providence conſiſteth.</p>
               <p>Let us now joyntly apply theſe ſeverall acts to free agents,
working according to choyce, or relation, ſuch as are the wils of
men: and that will open the way to take a view of <hi>Arminian</hi>
Heterodoxies, concerning this Article of Chriſtian beliefe: and
here two things muſt be premiſed: Firſt, that they be not depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of their own radicall, or originall internall libertie: Secondly,
that they be not exempt from the moving influence &amp; guberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Gods providence; the firſt whereof, would leave no juſt
roome for rewards and puniſhments; the other, as I ſaid before,
is injurious to the majeſtie and power of God:<note n="f" place="margin">Qui ſic homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes voluit eſſe liberos ut fecit ſacrilegos: Aug.</note> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>

<hi>for ſo attempting to make men free, that he made them ſacrilegious:</hi>

for a hogge of the Epicures heard, then for a Scholler in the
Schoole of Chriſt: and yet, this proud prodigious error is now,
though in other termes, ſtifly maintained. For what doe they
elſe, who aſcribe ſuch an abſolute independent libertie to the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:155835:25"/>
will of man; that it ſhould have in its owne power every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
every condition whatſoever, that belongs to operation; ſo
that all things required on the part of God, or otherwiſe to the
performance of an action being accompliſhed: it remaineth
ſolely, in the power of a mans owne will, whether he will doe
it, or no: which ſupreame and plainely divine liberty, joyned
with ſuch an abſolute uncontrollable power and dominion over
all his actions, would exempt and free the will of man, not onely
from all fore-determining, to the production of ſuch and ſuch ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffects;
but alſo, from any effectuall working or influence of the
providence of God into the will it ſelfe, that ſhould ſuſtaine,
helpe or co-operate with it, in doing or willing any thing: and
therefore the authours of this imaginarie liberty, have wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
framed an imaginary concurrence of Gods providence,
anſwerable unto it: <hi>viz.</hi> a generall and indifferent influence,
alwaies wayting, and expecting the will of man to determine
it ſelfe to this, or that effect, good or bad: God being as it
were alwaies ready at hand, to doe that ſmall part which he
hath in our actions, whenſoever we pleaſe to uſe him: or, if we
pleaſe to let him alone, he no way moveth us to the performance
of any thing: now God forbid that we ſhould give our conſent
to the choyce of ſuch a Captaine, under whoſe conduct we might
goe downe againe unto Paganiſme; to the erecting of ſuch an
Idol, into the Throne of the Almightie: No doubtleſſe; let us
be moſt indulgent to our wils, and aſſigne them all the libertie
that is competent unto a created nature, to doe all things freely
according to election and foregoing counſell, being free from all
naturall neceſſity, and outward compulſion: but for all this, let us
not preſume to denie Gods effectuall aſſiſtance, his particular

then I doe a houſe, when I doe not ſet it on fire, or a worme,
when I doe not tread upon it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for Gods concurring with inferiour cauſes in all

                  <hi>it is nothing but what ſuffers it to play

Thirdly, for Gods determining, or circumſcribing the will
of man to doe this or that in particular: they abſolutely explode
it as a thing deſtructive to their adored libertie:<note n="ſ" place="margin">Determinatio cum libertate ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra nullo modo conſiſtere po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt: Rem. apol<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cap. 7 fol. 82.</note> 
                  <hi>It is no way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent

                  <hi>Arminius, The
providence of God doth not determine the will of man to one part of
the contradiction:</hi> that is, God hath not determined that you
ſhall, nor doth by any meanes over-rule your wils, to doe this
thing, rather then that; to doe this, or to omit it: ſo that the
ſumme of their endeavour is to prove that the will of man, is ſo
abſolutely free, independent, and uncontrouleable, that God doth
not, nay with all his power cannot determine it, certainly and
infallibly to the performance of this or that particular action,
thereby to accompliſh his owne purpoſes, to attaine his owne
ends: truly it ſeemes to me the moſt unfortunate attempt that
ever Chriſtians lighted on, which if it ſhould get ſucceſſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable
to the greatneſſe of the undertaking, the providence of
God in mens eſſence, would be almoſt thruſt quite out of the
the world: <hi>tantae molis erat:</hi> the new goddeſſe contingencie, could
not be erected, untill the God of heaven was utterly diſpoyled
of his dominion over the ſons of men, and in the roome thereof
a home-bred Idol of ſelfe-ſufficiencie ſet up, and the world per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
to worſhip it: but that the building climbe no higher, let
all men obſerve how the word of God overthrowes this Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonian
tower.</p>
               <p>Firſt, in innumerable places it is punctuall, that his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
doth not onely beare rule in the counſels of men, and
their moſt ſecret reſolutions, whence the Prophet inferreth that
he knoweth that the way of man is not in himſelf, that <hi>it is not in
man that walketh to direct his wayes:</hi> Ierem. 10. 23. And <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
that a mans heart deviſeth his way, but the Lord directeth his
ſteps,</hi> Prov. 16. 9. <hi>David</hi> alſo having laid this ground, <hi>That the
Lord bringeth the counſell of the heathen to nought, and maketh the
devices of the people to be of none effect, but his owne counſell abideth
for ever, and the thoughts of his heart to all generations:</hi> Pſam. 33.
10, 11. proceedeth accordingly in his owne diſtreſſe to pray,
that the Lord would infatuate, and make<note n="u" place="margin">Dominus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipavit conſilium quod dederat Achitophel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendo in corde Abſolon ut tale conſilium repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaret, et aliud quod ei non ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediebat elige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret: Auguſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> de grat. et lib.

                  <hi>fooliſh the counſell of
Achitophel, 2 Sam.</hi> 15. 33. which alſo the Lord did, by working
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:155835:27"/>
in the heart of <hi>Abſolom,</hi> to hearken to the croſſe counſell of
<hi>Huſhai.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But alſo ſecondly, that the working of his providence is ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall
even in the hearts and wils of men, to turne them which
way he will, and to determine them to this, or that in particular
according as he pleaſeth: <hi>The preparations of the heart, in man,
and the anſwer of the tongue is from the Lord,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov.
16. 1. which <hi>Iacob</hi> truſted and relied on, when he prayed, That <hi>the
Lord would grant his ſonnes to finde favour and mercy, before that
man,</hi> Gen. 43. 14. whom then he ſuppoſed to be ſome Atheiſtical
Aegyptian; whence we muſt grant, if either the good old man,
beleeved that it was in the hand of God, to incline and unalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
turne and ſettle the heart of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> to favour his brethren,
or elſe his prayer muſt have had ſuch a ſenſleſſe ſenſe as this:
Grant O Lord, ſuch a generall influence of thy providence, that
the heart of that man, may be turned to good towards my ſons,
or elſe that it may not, being left to its own freedome; a ſtrange
requeſt; yet how it may be bettered, by one beleeving the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian
doctrine</hi> I cannot conceive: Thus <hi>Solomon</hi> affirmeth, that
<hi>the heart of the King is in the hand of the Lord, like the rivers of
water he turneth it which way he will,</hi> Pro. 21. 1. If the heart of a
King who hath an inward naturall libertie equall with others,
and an outward libertie belonging to his ſtate and condition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
them, be yet ſo in the hand of the Lord, as that he alwaies
turneth it, to what he pleaſeth in particular, then certainly other
men, are not excepted from the rule of the ſame providence:
which is the plaine ſenſe of theſe words, and the direct <hi>Theſis,</hi>
which we maintaine, in oppoſition to the <hi>Arminian</hi> Idol of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
independent Free-will: So <hi>Daniel</hi> alſo reproving the
Babylonian Tyrant, affirmeth that he glorified not God in whoſe
hand was his breath, and whoſe were all his wayes, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 23.
not onely his breath and life, but alſo all his wayes, his actions,
thoughts and words, were in the hand of God.</p>
               <p>Yea, Secondly, ſometimes the Saints of God, as I touched be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
doe pray that God would be pleaſed thus to determine their
hearts, and bend their wils, and wholly incline them to ſome
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:155835:28"/>
one certaine thing, and that without any prejudice to their true
and proper libertie: So <hi>David, Pſal. 119. 36. Incline my heart
unto thy teſtimonies, and not unto covetouſneſſe.</hi> This prayer being
his, may alſo be ours, and we may aske it in faith, relying on the
power, and promiſe of God in Chriſt, that he will performe our
petitions, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 14. Now I deſire any Chriſtian to reſolve,
whether by theſe and the like requeſts, he intendeth to deſire at
the hand of God, nothing but ſuch an indifferent motion to any
good, as may leave him to his owne choice whether he will doe
it or no; which is all the <hi>Arminians</hi> will grant him: or rather
that he would powerfully bind his heart and ſoule unto his Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
and worke in him an actuall embracing of all the waies
of God, not deſiring more libertie, but onely enough to doe it
willingly: Nay ſurely the prayers of Gods ſervants requeſting
with <hi>Solomon,</hi> that the Lord would be with them, and <hi>encline
their heart unto him to keepe his ſtatutes, and walke in his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements,</hi>
1 Kings 8. 5. 7. And with <hi>David,</hi> to <hi>create in them a
cleane heart, and renew a right ſpirit within them:</hi> Pſal. 51. when
according to Gods promiſes, they intreat <hi>him to put his feare in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their hearts: Ierem. 31. 32. To unite their hearts to feare his
Name,</hi> Pſal. 86. 11. to worke in them, both the will and the
deed, an actuall obedience unto his law cannot poſſibly aime at
any thing but a generall influence, enabling them alike, either to
doe, or not to doe, what they ſo earneſtly long after.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the certaintie of divers promiſes and threatnings of
Almightie God, dependeth upon his powerfull determining, and
turning the wils and heart of men which way he pleaſeth: thus
to them that feare him, he promiſeth that they ſhall finde favour
in the ſight of man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 4. Now if notwithſtanding, all Gods
powerfull operation in their hearts, it remaineth abſolutely in the
hands of men, whether they will favour them that feare him or
no: it is wholly in their power whether God ſhall be true in his
promiſes or no: ſurely when <hi>Jacob</hi> wraſtled with God on the
ſtrength of ſome ſuch promiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 12. he little thought of
any queſtion, whether it were in the power of God to performe
it: yea and the event ſhewed that there ought to be no ſuch
queſtion, <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n.</hi> 33. for the Lord turned the heart of his brother
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:155835:28"/>
                  <hi>Eſau,</hi> as he doth of others, when he <hi>makes them pitty his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
when at any time they have carried away captives,</hi> Pſal. 106.
46. See alſo the ſame powerfull operation, required to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
of his judgements: <hi>Job</hi> 12. 17. and <hi>Chap. 20. 21, &amp;c.</hi>
In briefe, there is no propheſie nor prediction in the whole Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
no promiſe to the Church or faithfull, to whoſe accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment,
the free actions and concurrence of men is required,
but evidently declareth, that God diſpoſeth of the hearts of men,
ruleth their wils, inclineth their affections, and determines them
freely to chooſe, and doe, what he in his good pleaſure hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
ſhall be performed; ſuch as were the propheſies of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
from the Babyloniſh captivitie by <hi>Cyrus, Iſa.</hi> 42. Of the
converſion of the Gentiles, of the ſtabilitie of the Church, <hi>Matth.</hi>
16. Of the deſtruction of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> by the <hi>Romans, Matth.</hi> 24.
with innumerable others: I will adde onely ſome few reaſons
for the cloſe of this long diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>This opinion that God hath nothing but a generall influence
into the actions of men, not effectually moving their wils, to this,
or that, in particular.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it granteth a goodneſſe of <hi>entitie</hi> or being unto divers
things, whereof God is not the authour: as thoſe ſpeciall actions
which men performe without his ſpeciall concurrence; which
is blaſphemous: the Apoſtle affirmes that of him are all things.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Qui aliquid boni à Deo non effici affirmat, ille Deum eſſe negat: ſi namque vel tantillum bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni à Deo non eſt: jam non om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis boni effector eſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

God moveth him no more to prayer, then to evill communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
tending to the corruption of good manners.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it maketh all the decrees of God, whoſe execution
dependeth on humane actions, to be altogether uncertaine, and
his fore-knowledge of ſuch things to be fallible, and eaſily to be
deceived: ſo that there is no reconciliation poſſible to be hoped
for, betwixt theſe following and the like aſſertions.</p>

I ſhall now preſent unto you, the ſpirit of God
once more contending, with the towring imaginations of poore
mortals, about a tranſcendent priviledge of greatneſſe, glory and
power: for having made his decrees mutable, his preſcience
fallible, and almoſt quite deveſted him of his providence; as the
ſumme and iſſue of all their endeavours, they affirme <hi>that his will
may be reſiſted, he may faile of his intentions, be fruſtrate of his ends,
he may, and doth propoſe, ſuch things, as he neither doth, nor can at
any time accompliſh: and that, becauſe the execution of ſuch acts of
his will, might haply claſh againſt the freedome of the wills of men:</hi>

in this matter, by reaſon of the ſeverall acceptations of the
will of God: eſpecially in regard of that whereby it is affirmed
that his law and precepts, are his will, which alas we all of us too
often reſiſt or tranſgreſſe, I will unfold one diſtinction of the will
of God, which will leave it cleare, what it is, that the <hi>Arminians</hi>

that it importeth a relation to the thing willed: the eſſence of

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:155835:30"/>
were taken alwayes properly and ſtrictly for the eternall
will of God: the differences hereof, that are uſually given, are
rather diſtinctions of the ſignification of the word, then of the
thing.</p>
               <p>In which regard, they are not onely tolerably, but ſimply ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary;
becauſe without him, it is utterly impoſſible to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
ſome places of Scripture, ſeemingly repugnant: in the 22.
Chapter of <hi>Geneſis v. 2. God commandeth</hi> Abraham, <hi>to take his
onely ſonne</hi> Iſaac; <hi>and offer him for a burnt offering in the land of
Moriah.</hi> Here the words of God are declarative of ſome will
of God unto <hi>Abraham:</hi> who knew it ought to be, and little
thought, but that it ſhould be performed: but yet, when he actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
addreſſed himſelf, to his dutie in obedience to the will of
God: he receiveth a countermand, <hi>verſ. 12. that he ſhould not lay
his hand upon the childe, to ſacrifice him:</hi> the event plainly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſteth,
that it was the will of God that <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſhould not be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed:
and yet notwithſtanding, by reaſon of his command;
<hi>Abraham</hi> ſeemes before bound to beleeve, that it was well-pleaſing
unto God, that he ſhould accompliſh what he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned:
if the will of God in the Scripture be uſed but in one
acceptation, here is a plaine contradiction: Thus God commands
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> to let his people goe: could <hi>Pharaoh</hi> thinke otherwiſe,
nay was he not bound to beleeve, that it was the will of God, that
he ſhould diſmiſſe the Iſraelites at the firſt hearing of the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage:
yet God affirmes, that he would harden his heart, that he
ſhould not ſuffer them to depart, untill he had ſhewed his ſignes
and wonders in the land of Egypt: to reconcile theſe, and the
like places of Scripture, both the ancient Fathers, and Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
with moderne Divines, doe affirme that the one will of
God, may be ſaid to be divers or manifold, in regard of the ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
manners, whereby he willeth thoſe things to be done, which
he willeth, as alſo in other reſpects: and yet taken in its proper
ſignification, is ſimply one and the ſame: the vulgar diſtinction of
Gods ſecret and revealed will, is ſuch, as to which all the other
may be reduced: and therefore I have choſen it to inſiſt upon.</p>
               <p>The ſecret will of God, in his eternall, unchangeable purpoſe,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:155835:30"/>
concerning all things which he hath made, to be brought by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
means to their appointed ends: of this himſelfe affirmeth,
<hi>that his counſell ſhall ſtand and he will doe all his pleaſure, Iſaiah.</hi>
46. 10. this ſome call the abſolute efficacious will of God, the
will of his good pleaſure alwayes fulfilled: and indeed this is the
only proper, eternall, conſtant, immutable will of God, whoſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
can neither be broken, nor its law tranſgreſſed, ſo long as with
him there is neither change, nor ſhadow of turning.</p>
               <p>The revealed will of God, containeth not his purpoſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,
but our dutie, not what he will doe according to his good
pleaſure, but what we ſhould doe if we will pleaſe him: and
this, conſiſting in his word, his precepts and promiſes, belongeth
to us and our children, that we may doe the will of God: now
this indeed is rather <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, that which God
willeth, then his will, but tearmed ſo, as we call that the will of
a man which he hath determined, ſhall be done: <hi>This is the will
of him that ſent me, that every one which ſeeth the ſonne and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
on him, may have everlaſting life, ſaith our Saviour:</hi> Ioh.
6. 40. that is, this is that which his will hath appointed: hence
it is called <hi>voluntas ſigni,</hi> or the ſigne of his will, Metaphorically
only called his will, ſaith<note n="a" place="margin">Aquin. q. g. 19. a 11. c.</note>

of his eternall decree and intention, which as it is utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
impoſſible for us to tranſgreſſe or fruſtrate: ſo were we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable
if we ſhould: a Maſter requires of his ſervant, to doe
what he commands, not to accompliſh what he intends: which
perhaps he never diſcovered unto him: nay, the commands of
ſuperiours, are not alwayes ſignes that the commander will have
the things commanded actually performed, as in all precepts for
triall: but only that they who are ſubjects to this command, ſhall
be obligd to obedience, as farre as the ſenſe of it doth extend, <hi>&amp;


hoc clarum eſt in praeceptis divinis,</hi> ſaith<note n="b" place="margin">Durand. diſt c. 48. q. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Durand. &amp;c.</hi> and this
is cleere in the commands of God: by which we are obliged to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:155835:31"/>
doe, what he commandeth, and it is not alwayes his pleaſure, that
the thing it ſelfe, in regard of the event, ſhall yet be accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
as we ſaw before in the examples of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the will of God in the firſt acceptation, is ſaid to be hid
or ſecret, not becauſe it is ſo alwayes, for it is in ſome particulars
revealed and made knowne unto us, two wayes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, by his word, as where God affirmeth that the dead ſhall
riſe, we neither doubt not, but that they ſhall riſe, and that it is
the abſolute will of God that they ſhall doe ſo. Secondly, by the
effects, for when any thing cometh to paſſe, we may caſt the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
on the will of God as its cauſe, and looke upon it as a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of his purpoſe. <hi>Iacobs</hi> ſonnes little imagined, that it was
the will of God, by them to ſend their brother into Egypt: yet
afterward, <hi>Ioſeph</hi> tels them plainly, it was not they, but God that
ſent him thither, <hi>Gen.</hi> 45. but it is ſaid to be ſecret for two cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:
Firſt, becauſe for the moſt part it is ſo, there is nothing in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
iſſues declarative of Gods determination but only the event:
which while it is future is hidden to them who have faculties to
judge of things paſt and preſent, but not to diſcerne things for to
come. Hence Saint <hi>Iames</hi> bids us not be too peremptory in our
determinations, if we will doe this, or that, not knowing how
God will cloſe with us, for its performance. Secondly, it is ſaid
to be ſecret, in reference to its cauſe, which for the moſt part is
paſt our finding out: his paths are in the deeps and his footſteps
are not known.</p>
               <p>It appeareth then, that the ſecret and revealed will of God
are divers, in ſundry reſpects, but chiefly, in regard of their acts,
and their objects. Firſt, in regard of their acts, the ſecret will of
God is his eternall decree, and determination, concerning any
thing to be done, in its appointed time: his revealed will is an act,
whereby he declareth himſelf to love, or approve any thing, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ever it be done, or no.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they are divers in regard of their objects, the object
of Gods purpoſe and decree, is that which is good in any kinde,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:155835:31"/>
with reference to its actuall exiſtence, for it muſt infallibly be
performed: but the object of his revealed will, is that only
which is morally good, (I ſpeake of it inaſmuch as it approveth
or commandeth,) agreeing to the Law, and the Goſpell: and
that conſidered, only inaſmuch as it is good: for whither it be
ever actually performed, or no, is accidentall to the object of
Gods revealed will.</p>
               <p>Now of theſe two differences, the firſt is perpetuall, in regard
of their ſeverall acts, but not ſo the latter, they are ſometimes co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incident
in regard of their objects: for inſtance, God command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
us to beleeve, here his revealed will, is that we ſhould ſo do:
withall he intendeth we ſhall doe ſo, and therefore ingenerateth
faith in our hearts that we may beleeve: here his ſecret and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
will, are coincident, the former being his precept, that we
ſhould beleeve, the latter his purpoſe that we ſhall beleeve: in
this caſe, I ſay, the object of the one, and the other, is the ſame,
even what we ought to doe, and what he will doe.</p>
               <p>And this inaſmuch, <hi>as he hath wrought all our works in us:
Iſaiah</hi> 26. 12. they are our own works, which he works in us:
his act in us, and by us, is ofttimes our dutie towards him: he
commands us by his revealed will to walke in his Statutes, and
keep his Laws, upon this, he alſo promiſeth that he will ſo effect
all things, that of ſome this ſhall be performed: <hi>Ezek. 36. 26,
27. A new heart alſo will I give you, and a new ſpirit will I put
within you, and I will take away the ſtony heart out of your fleſh, and
I will give you an heart of fleſh: And I will put my ſpirit within you,
and cauſe you to walke in my ſtatutes, and you ſhall keepe my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and doe them:</hi> ſo that the ſelfe ſame obedience of the
people of God, is here the object of his will, taken in either ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation:
and yet the precept of God, is not here as ſome learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men ſuppoſe, declarative of Gods intention, for then, it muſt
be ſo to all, to whom it is given, which evidently it is not, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
are commanded to beleeve, on whom God never beſtoweth
faith: it is ſtill to be looked upon, as a meere declaration of our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
its cloſing with Gods intention, being accidentall unto it:
there is a wide difference betwixt, doe ſuch a thing, and you ſhall
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:155835:32"/>
doe it: if Gods command to <hi>Iudas</hi> to beleeve, imported as
much as it is my purpoſe, and intention that <hi>Iudas</hi> ſhall beleeve, it
muſt needs contradict that will of God, whereby he determined
that <hi>Iudas</hi> for his infidelitie ſhould goe to his own place: his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
are in all obedience of us to be performed, but doe not ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
his will, that we ſhall actually fulfill his commands. <hi>Abraham</hi>
was not bound to beleeve, that it was Gods intention that <hi>Iſaac</hi>
ſhould be ſacrificed, but, that it was his duty; there was no obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
on <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to thinke, it was Gods purpoſe the people
ſhould depart, at the firſt ſummons, he had nothing to doe with
that: but there was one, to beleeve that if he would pleaſe God,
he muſt let them goe. Hence divers things of good uſe in theſe
controverſies may be collected.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That God may command many things by his word, which
he never decreed that they ſhould actually be performed: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
in ſuch things, his words are not a revelation of his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
decree and purpoſe: but only a declaration of ſome thing
where with he is well pleaſed, be it by us performed or no in the
forecited caſe, he commanded <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> to let his people goe, and
plagued him for refuſing to obey his command: hence we may
not collect, that God intended the obedience and converſion of
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> by this his precept, but was fruſtrated of his intention,
for the Scripture is evident and cleere, that God purpoſed by his
diſobedience, to accompliſh an end farre different, even a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation
of his glory by his puniſhment: but only that obedience
unto his commands is pleaſing unto him: as 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 22.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That the will of God to which our obedience is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
is the revealed will of God, contained in his word, whoſe
compliance with his decree is ſuch, that hence we learne three
things tending to the execution of it. Firſt, that it is the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the word of God, and the diſpenſation thereof, inſtantly to
perſwade to faith and obedience: Secondly, that it is our duty,
by all means to aſpire to the performance of all things by it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned,
and our fault if we doe not. Thirdly, that God by theſe
means, will accompliſh his eternall decree of ſaving his elect, and
that he willeth the ſalvation of others, inaſmuch as he calleth
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:155835:32"/>
them unto the performance of the condition thereof: now our
obedience is ſo to be regulated by this revealed will of God, that
we may ſin, either by omiſſion, againſt its precepts: or commiſſion
againſt its prohibitions: although by our ſo omitting, or commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of any thing, the ſecret will or purpoſe of God be fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.
Had <hi>Abraham</hi> diſobeyed Gods precept, when he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to ſacrifice his ſonne <hi>Iſaac:</hi> though Gods will had been
accompliſhed thereby, who never intended it: yet <hi>Abraham</hi> had
grievouſly ſinned againſt the revealed will of God, the rule of his
duty: the holineſſe of our actions, conſiſteth in a conformity unto
his precepts, and not unto his purpoſes: on this ground (<note n="c" place="margin">Multi volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem Dei faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt cum illam nituntur vitare, et reſiſtendo imprudenter ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequuntur divino conſilio: Greg. Moral. lib. 6. cap. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Gregory</hi>
affirmeth) <hi>that many fulfill the will of God</hi> (that is his intentions)
<hi>when they thinke to change it,</hi> (by tranſgreſſing his precepts) <hi>and
by reſiſting, imprudently obey Gods purpoſe:</hi> and to ſhew how
meerely we in our actions are tied to this rule of our duty.<note n="d" place="margin">Auguſt. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chirid: ad Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren: cap: 101.</note> Saint
<hi>Auſtine</hi> ſhews how a man may do good in a thing croſſe to Gods
ſecret will: and evill in that which complyeth with it: which
he illuſtrates by the example of a ſicke parent having two chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
the one wicked, who deſires his fathers death, the other
godly, and he prayes for his life: but the will of God is he ſhall
die, agreeably to the deſire of the wicked childe: and yet it is
the other, who hath performed his duty, and done what is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
unto God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, to returne from this unneceſſarie digreſſion: that
which we have now in agitation, is the ſecret will of God, which
we have before unfolded, and this it is that we charge the <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
for affirming, that it may be reſiſted: that is, <hi>That God may
faile in his purpoſes, come ſhort of what he earneſtly intendeth; or be
fruſtrated of his aime and end:</hi> as if he ſhould determinately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
the faith and ſalvation of any man: it is in the power of that
man, to make void his determination, and not beleeve, and not
be ſaved: now it is onely in caſes of this nature, wherein our
owne Free-wils have an intereſt, that they thus limit and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribe
the power of the moſt high: in other things, they grant
his omnipotencie to be of no leſſe extent then others doe: but in

               </p>
               <p>In briefe, their whole doctrine in this point is laid downe by
<hi>Corvinus,</hi> Chap. 3. againſt <hi>Moulin,</hi> and the third Section: where
firſt, he alloweth of the diſtinction of the will of God, into that
whereby <hi>he will have us doe ſomething,</hi> and that <hi>whereby he will doe
any thing himſelfe:</hi> the firſt is nothing but his Law and Precepts,
which we with him affirme may be ſaid to be reſiſted, in as much
as it is tranſgreſſed: the latter he ſaith, If it reſpect any act of
mans, <hi>may be conſidered as praeceding that act, or following it: If
praeceding it, then it may be reſiſted, if man will not co-operate:</hi> Now
this is the will of God whereby himſelfe intendeth to doe any
thing: The ſumme of which diſtinction is this, the will of God
concerning the future being of any thing, may be conſidered as it
goeth before the actuall exiſtence of the thing it ſelfe, and in this
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:155835:34"/>
regard it may be hindered or reſiſted; but as it is conſidered to
follow any act of man, it is alwaies fulfilled: by which latter
member, ſtriving to mollifie the harſhneſſe of the former, he
runs himſelfe into inexplicable <hi>non-ſenſe,</hi> affirming, that, that
act of the will of God, whereby he intendeth men ſhall doe any
thing, cannot be hindered after they have done it, that is, God
hath irreſiſtibly purpoſed they ſhall doe it, provided they doe it:
in his following Diſcourſe alſo, he plainly grants, that there is no
act of Gods will about the ſalvation of men, that may not be made
voide and of none effect, but onely that generall decree, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he hath eſtabliſhed an inſeparable connexion betweene faith
and ſalvation, or whereby he hath appointed faith in Chriſt, to be
the meanes of attaining bleſſedneſſe: which is onely an imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
act of Gods will, producing no outward effect: ſo that every
act thereof, that hath an externall iſſue by humane co-operation,
is fruſtrable and may fall to the ground: which in what direct
oppoſition it ſtands to the word of God, let theſe following in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
declare.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Our God is in heaven,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt, he hath done
whatſoever he pleaſed,</hi> Pſal. 115. 5. not onely part, but all, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
he pleaſed ſhould come to paſſe by any meanes: <hi>He ruleth
in the kingdome of men, and giveth it to whom he will,</hi> Dan. 4. 23.
The tranſpoſition of kingdomes, is not without the mixture of
divers free and voluntary actions of men, and yet in that great
worke, God doth all that he pleaſeth; yea, before him, <hi>all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of the earth are reputed as nothing, and he doth according
to his will, in the Armie of heaven and among the inhabitants of the
earth, and none can ſtay his hand, or ſay unto him, What doſt thou?</hi>
verſ. 35. <hi>My counſell,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſhall ſtand, and I will doe all my
pleaſure,</hi> Iſa. 46. 10. <hi>I have purpoſed I will alſo doe it,</hi> verſ. 11.
Nay, ſo certaine is he of accompliſhing all his purpoſes; that he
confirmes it with an Oath, <hi>the Lord of Hoaſts hath ſworne, ſurely
as I have thought, ſo it ſhall come to paſſe, and as I have purpoſed ſo
it ſhall ſtand:</hi> Iſa. 14. 24. and indeed it were a very ſtrange
thing, that God ſhould intend what he fore-ſeeth will never
come to paſſe: but I confeſſe this Argument will not be preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
againſt the <hi>Arminians</hi> who queſtion that praeſcience: but yet,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:155835:34"/>

and their abettors, have troubled the
Church of Chriſt, comes next unto our conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
the eternall predeſtination of Almightie
God, that fountaine of all ſpirituall bleſſings, of all
the effects of Gods love derived unto us through Chriſt: the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molliſhing
of this rocke of our ſalvation, hath been the chiefe
indeavour of all the Patrons of humane ſelfe-ſufficiencie: ſo to
vindicate unto themſelves, a power, and independent abillitie of
doing good, of making themſelves to differ from others, of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
everlaſting happineſſe, without going one ſteppe from
without themſelves: and this is their firſt attempt, to attaine
their ſecond propoſed end, of building a tower, from the toppe
whereof they may mount into heaven, whoſe foundation is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the ſand of their owne free-will and indeavours: quite
on the ſudden (what they have done in effect) to have taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
this divine praedeſtination, name, and thing, had beene an
attempt as noted as notorious, and not likely to attaine the leaſt
ſucceſſe amongſt men profeſſing to beleeve the Goſpel of Chriſt:
wherefore, ſuffering the name to remaine, they have aboliſhed
the thing it ſelfe, and ſubſtituted another ſo unlike it in the
roome thereof, that any one may ſee they have gotten a bleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eyed
<hi>Leah</hi> inſtead of <hi>Rachel,</hi> and hugge a cloud inſtead of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itie.
The true Doctrine it ſelfe, hath beene ſo excellently delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by divers learned Divines, ſo freed from all Objections, that
I ſhall onely briefely and plainly lay it downe, and that with ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
reference to the ſeventeenth Article of our Church, where
it is cleerely avowed; ſhewing withall which is my chiefe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
how it is thwarted, oppoſed, and overthrowne by the
<hi>Arminians: Predeſtination in the uſuall ſenſe it is taken, is a part
of Gods providence, concerning his creatures, diſtinguiſhed from it
by a double reſtriction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, in reſpect of their <hi>Obiects,</hi> for whereas the Decree of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:155835:35"/>
providence comprehendeth his intentions towards all the works
of his hands, predeſtination reſpecteth onely rationall creatures.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in regard of their <hi>ends,</hi> for whereas his providence
directeth all creatures in generall, to thoſe ſeverall ends to which
at length they are brought, whether they are proportionated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their natures, or exceeding the ſphere of their naturall activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
Predeſtination is exerciſed onely in directing rationall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
to ſupernaturall ends: ſo that in generall it is <hi>the counſell,
decree, or purpoſe of Almightie God, concerning the laſt and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall
end of his rationall creatures, to be accompliſhed for the
praiſe of his glory:</hi> But this alſo muſt receive a double reſtriction,
before we come preciſely, to what, we in this place aime at: and
theſe againe in regard of the objects or the ends thereof.</p>
               <p>The Object of Predeſtination is, all rationall creatures; now
theſe are either Angels or men, of Angels I ſhall not treat: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
the end by it provided for them is either eternall happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
or eternall miſerie: I ſpeake onely of the former, the act
of Gods predeſtination, tranſmitting men to everlaſting happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
and in this reſtrained ſenſe, it differs not at all from ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and we may uſe them as <hi>Synonyma,</hi> termes of the ſame
importance: though by ſome affirming that God predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
them to faith whom he hath choſen, they ſeeme to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed
as the decrees of the end, and the meanes conducing
thereunto; whereof the firſt is Election, intending the end, and
then takes place Predeſtination providing the meanes; but this
exact diſtinction appeareth not directly in the Scripture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This Election the word of God propoſeth unto us, as the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
immutable decree of</hi> Almightie God, whereby, before the
foundation of the world, out of his owne good pleaſure, he choſe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
men, determining to free them from ſinne and miſerie, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow
upon them grace and faith, to give them unto Chriſt, to bring
them to everlaſting bleſſedneſſe for the praiſe of his glorious grace:
<hi>or as it is expreſſed in our Church Articles,</hi> Predeſtination to life
is the everlaſting purpoſe of God, whereby before the foundations of

not according to our workes, but according to his owne purpoſe and

2 Tim.</hi> 1. 9. Now from hence it would undoubtedly follow, that
no good thing in us, can be the cauſe of our election, for every
cauſe muſt in order praecede its effect, but all things whereof we
by any meanes are partakers, in as much as they are ours are tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porarie,
and ſo cannot be the cauſe of that which is eternall:
things with that qualification, muſt have reference to the ſole
will and good pleaſure of God, which inference would breake
the necke of the <hi>Arminian</hi> election: wherefore to prevent ſuch
a fatall ruine, they deny the principle, <hi>to wit, that election is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall:</hi>

nothing but an act of his juſtice, approving our obedience: and

                  <hi>yea,</hi> ſay they, <hi>we acknowledge no other predeſtination to

               <p>Secondly, the Article affirmeth that it is conſtant, that is, one
immutable decree, agreeably alſo to the Scriptures, teaching but
one purpoſe, but one fore-knowledge, one good pleaſure, one
decree of God, concerning the infallible ordination of his elect

the <hi>Arminians</hi> this doctrine? not one word of it from the
word of truth, no mention there of any ſuch deſultory election, no
ſpeech of faith, but ſuch as is conſequent to the one eternall irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocable
decree of predeſtination, <hi>they beleeved who were ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to eternall life,</hi> Acts 13. 48. no diſtinction of men halfe and

ſpight of all oppoſition: neither will reaſon allow us to thinke
any immanent act of God, to be incomplete or revocable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of the neere alliance it hath with his very nature: but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
Scripture, God himſelfe, all muſt give place to any abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
if they ſtand in the <hi>Arminian</hi> way, bringing in their Idoll
with ſhouts, and preparing his throne, by claiming the cauſe of
their predeſtination to be in themſelves.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Article is cleere, that the object of this predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is ſome particular men choſen out of mankinde, that is, it is
ſuch an act of God, as concerneth ſome men in particular: taking
them as it were aſide from the middeſt of their brethren, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning
them for ſome ſpeciall end and purpoſe, the Scripture alſo

that theſe particular perſons and no other are they, which cannot

under any other notion: to apprehend <hi>an election of men,

ſuch a conceited <hi>Platonicall</hi> abſtraction, as it ſeemes ſtrange that

indeed or in expectation, in a word that there ſhould be <hi>a purpoſe

everlaſting life:</hi> but what ſo great exception is this doctrine ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
unto; what wickedneſſe doth it include, that it ſhould not
be accounted moſt holy? nay, is not only the matter, but the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
tearmes of it contained in the Scripture: doth not it ſay the
elect are few, and they choſen before the foundation of the world;
without any reſpect to their obedience or any thing that they had
done: out of Gods meere gracious good pleaſure, that his free
purpoſe according to election might ſtand; even becauſe ſo it
pleaſed him: and this that they might be holy, beleeve, and be
ſanctified, that they might come unto Chriſt and by him be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved

               <p>We poore ſouls thought hitherto, that we might have belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
according unto Scripture, that ſome by this purpoſe were in
a peculiar manner <hi>made the Fathers, (thine they were</hi>) and by him
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:155835:39"/>
                  <hi>given unto Chriſt,</hi> that he might <hi>bring them unto glory,</hi> and that
theſe men were ſo certaine and unchangeable a number, that not
only God knoweth them as being his, but alſo, that Chriſt <hi>calleth
them all by name:</hi> Ioh. 10. 3. and looketh, that none taketh them
out of his hand: we never imagined before, that Chriſt hath been
the Mediatour of an uncertaine Covenant, becauſe there are no
certaine perſons covenanted withall, but ſuch as may or may not
fulfill the condition: we alway thought, that ſome had been ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
before by Gods purpoſe from the reſt of the periſhing
world, that Chriſt might lay down his life for his friends, for his
ſheepe, for them that were given him of his Father: but now it
ſhould ſeeme he was ordained to be a King, when it was altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
uncertaine whether he ſhould ever have any ſubjects, to be a
head without a body, or to ſuch a Church whoſe collection and
continuance depends wholly and ſolely on the will of men.</p>
               <p>Theſe are doctrines that I beleeve ſearchers of the Scripture,
had ſcarſe ever been acquainted withall, had they not lighted on
ſuch Expoſitors, as teach,<note n="o" place="margin">Ratio dilectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis perſonae eſt, quod probitas, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, vel pietas, qua ex officio ſuo &amp; praeſcripto Dei iſta perſona praedita ſit.

                  <hi>that the only cauſe why God loveth, (or
chooſeth) any perſon, is, becauſe the honeſty, faith and pietie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
according to Gods command and his own dutie, he is endued,
are acceptable to God:</hi> which though we grant it true of Gods
conſequent, or approving love; yet ſurely there is a divine love,
wherewith he looks upon us otherwiſe, when he gives us unto
Chriſt: elſe, either our giving unto Chriſt is not out of love, or,
we are pious, juſt, and faithfull, before we come unto him, that
is, we have no need of him at all: againſt either way, though we
may blot theſe teſtimonies out of our hearts, yet they will ſtand
ſtill recorded in holy Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> that God ſo loved us when
we were his enemies, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 8. ſinners, <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. of no ſtrength,
that he ſent his only begotten Sonne to die, that we ſhould not
periſh but have life everlaſting, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 16. but of this enough.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Another thing that the Article aſſerteth according to
the Scripture is, <hi>that there is no other cauſe of our election,</hi> but Gods
<hi>own counſell,</hi> it recounteth no motives in us, nothing impelling
the will of God, to chooſe ſome out of mankinde, rejecting o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
but his own decree that is his abſolute will and good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:155835:40"/>
ſo that as there is no cauſe, in any thing without himſelfe,
why he would create the world or elect any at all, for he doth all
theſe things for himſelfe for the praiſe of his own glory, ſo there
is no cauſe in ſingular elected perſons, why God ſhould chooſe
them, rather then others; he looked upon all mankinde in the
ſame condition, veſted with the ſame qualifications, or rather
without any at all, for it <hi>is the children not yet borne, before they do
either good or evill, that are choſen or reiected,</hi> his free grace embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the one, and paſſing over the other, yet here we muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
that although God freely without any deſert of theirs choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
ſome men to be partakers, both of the end and the means,
yet he beſtoweth faith or the means, on none, but for the merit of
Chriſt: neither doe any attaine the end or ſalvation, but by their
own faith through that righteouſneſſe of his: the free grace of
God notwithſtanding chooſing <hi>Iacob,</hi> when <hi>Eſau</hi> is rejected, the
only antecedent cauſe of any difference, betweene the elect and
reprobates, remaineth firme and unſhaken: and ſurely unleſſe
men were reſolved to truſt wholly to their own bottomes, to take
nothing <hi>gratis</hi> at the hands of God, they would not endeavour to
rob him of his glory: of having mercy on whom he will have
mercy, of loving us without our deſert, before the world began:
if we muſt claime an intereſt in obtaining the <hi>temporall acts</hi> of his
favour, by our own indeavours; yet oh, let us grant him the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of being good unto us, only for his own ſake, when we were
in his hand as the clay in the hand of the potter: what made this
piece of clay, fit for comely ſervice and not a veſſell wherein
there is no pleaſure, but the power, and will of the framer? it is
enough, yea, too much for them to repine and ſay, why haſt thou

are prepared for honour, exalt themſelves againſt him, and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice

if the <hi>Arminians</hi> be not guiltie, let the following declaration of

their faith, and good workes: for there is not any one perſon, as
ſuch a perſon, notwithſtanding all this, that in their judgement is
in this life elected: but onely as he is conſidered with thoſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications,
of which he may at any time diveſt himſelfe, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

               <p>The ſumme of their Doctrine in this particular, is laid by one

which giveth light to that place of<note n="u" place="margin">Deum nullam creaturam prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe ad vitam ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternam amare, niſi conſiderata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ut juſtam ſive ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitia legali ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve evangelica, Armin. artic. per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend. fol. 21.</note>

have a more ſure teſtimonie to which we will take heed, even
the holy Scripture pleading ſtrongly for Gods free and undeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
grace.</p>
               <p>Firſt, our Saviour Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 26. declaring how God
revealeth the Goſpel unto ſome, which is hidden from others:
a ſpeciall fruit of election: reſteth in his will and good pleaſure as
the onely cauſe thereof: <hi>even ſo O Father, for ſo it ſeemed good in
thy ſight:</hi> ſo comforting his little flock, <hi>Luk. 12. 32. he bids them
feare not, for it is your Fathers good pleaſure to give you the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:</hi>
his good pleaſure is the onely cauſe why his kingdome is
prepared for you, rather then others: but is there no other reaſon
of this diſcrimination? No; he doth it all, <hi>that his purpoſe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to election might ſtand firme,</hi> Rom. 9. 11. For we are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated
according to the purpoſe of him, who worketh <hi>all
things after the counſell of his owne will,</hi> Epheſ. 1. 11. But did not
this counſell of God direct him to chooſe us rather then others?
becauſe we had ſomething to commend us more then they?
No; <hi>The Lord did not ſet his love upon you, nor chooſe you becauſe
you were more in number then any people, but becauſe the Lord loved
you:</hi> Deut. 7. 7, 8. He hath mercy, on whom he will have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
<hi>yea, before the children were borne and had done either good or
evill, that the purpoſe of God according to election might ſtand, not
of workes, but of him that calleth it was ſaid unto her, the
elder ſhall ſerve the younger, as it is written, Jacob have I loved,
but Eſau have I hated:</hi> Rom. 9. 11, 12. In briefe, where ever
there is any mention of election or predeſtination, it is ſtill ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with the purpoſe, love, or will, of God; his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
whereby he knoweth them that are his, his free
power and ſupreame dominion over all things: of our faith, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
or any thing importing ſo much, not one ſyllable, no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
unleſſe it be as the fruit and effect thereof: it is the ſole act
of his free grace and good pleaſure, that <hi>he might make knowne
the riches of his glory towards the veſſels of mercy:</hi> Rom. 9. 23.
for this onely end hath he ſaved us and called us <hi>with an holy cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
not according to our workes, but according to his owne purpoſe
and grace, which was given in Ieſus Chriſt before the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,</hi>
2 Tim. 1. 9. Even our calling is free and undeſerved, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:155835:42"/>
flowing from that moſt <hi>free grace of election, whereof</hi> we
are partakers before we are: it were needleſſe to heape up more
teſtimonies, in a thing ſo cleere and evident: when God and
man ſtand in competition, who ſhall be accounted the cauſe of an
eternall good, we may be ſure the Scripture will paſſe the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
on the part of the moſt high: and the ſentence in this caſe
may be derived from thence by theſe following reaſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, If finall perſeverance in faith and obedience, be the cauſe
of, or a condition required unto election, then none can be ſaid
in this life to be elected: for no man is a finall <hi>perſeverer</hi> untill he
be dead, untill he hath finiſhed his courſe and conſummated the
faith: but certaine it is that it is ſpoken of ſome in the Scripture,
that they are even in this life elected: <hi>few are choſen,</hi> Mat. 20. 16.
<hi>for the elects ſake thoſe dayes ſhall be ſhortned,</hi> Matth. 24. <hi>and ſhall
ſeduce if it were poſſible the very elect,</hi> verſ. 24. where it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that election is required to make one perſevere in the faith:
but no where is perſeverance in the faith required, to election:
yea and <hi>Peter</hi> gives us all a command, that we ſhould give all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
<hi>to get an aſſurance of our election even in this life,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.
10. and therefore ſurely it cannot be a decree preſuppoſing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummated
faith and obedience.</p>
               <p>Secondly, conſider two things of our eſtate, before the firſt
temporall act of Gods free grace, (for grace is no grace if it be
not free) which is the firſt effect of our predeſtination, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth
us: <hi>Were we better then others, no in no wiſe? both Iewes
and Gentiles, were all under ſinne,</hi> Rom. 3. 9. <hi>there is no difference
for we have all ſinned and come ſhort of the glory of God,</hi> verſ. 23.
<hi>being all dead in treſpaſſes and ſinnes,</hi> Epheſ. 2. 1. <hi>Being by nature
children of wrath as well as others,</hi> verſ. 3. <hi>a farre off untill we are
made nigh by the blood of Chriſt,</hi> verſ. 12. <hi>we were enemies againſt
God,</hi> Rom. 5. 10. Titus. 3. 3. and looke what deſert there is in
us with theſe qualifications, when our vocation the firſt effect of
our predeſtination, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſheweth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 30. and as I
ſhall prove hereafter, ſeparateth us from the world of unbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
ſo much there is in reſpect of predeſtination it ſelfe; ſo that
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:155835:42"/>
if we have any way deſerved it, it is by being ſinners, enemies,
children of wrath, and dead in treſpaſſes: theſe are our events,
this is the glory whereof we ought to be aſhamed.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, when they are in the ſame ſtate of actuall alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
from God, yet then in reſpect of his purpoſe to ſave them
by Chriſt: ſome are ſaid to be his; <hi>thine they were and thou gaveſt
them unto me,</hi> Iohn 17. 6. they were his before they came unto
Chriſt by faith; the ſheepe of Chriſt before they are called, <hi>for he
calleth his ſheepe by name,</hi> Iohn 10. 30. before they come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the flocke or congregation: <hi>for other ſheepe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I have
which are not of this fold: which muſt alſo be gathered,</hi> Ioh. 10.
16. to be beleved of God before they love him, <hi>herein is love, not
that we loved God, but that he loved us:</hi> 1 Ioh. 4. 10. Now all this
muſt be with reference to Gods purpoſe of bringing them unto
Chriſt, and by him unto glory: which we ſee goeth before all
their faith and obedience.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Election is an eternall act of Gods will, <hi>he hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
us before the foundation of the world,</hi> Epheſ. 1. 4. conſummated
antecedently to all dutie of ours, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 11. now every cauſe
muſt in order of nature, praecede its effect; nothing hath an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitie
in cauſing, before it hath a being: operation, in every kinde
is a ſecond act, flowing from the eſſence of a thing, which is the
firſt: but all our graces and workes, our faith, obedience, pietie
and charitie, are all temporall, of yeſterday, the ſame ſtanding
with our ſelves, and no longer, and therefore cannot be the cauſe
of, no nor ſo much as a condition neceſſarily required for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment
of an eternall act of God; irrevocably eſtabliſhed
before we are.</p>
               <p>Fourthly: If Predeſtination be for faith foreſeene, theſe three
things, with divers ſuch abſurdities will neceſſarily follow: firſt,
that election is not of him that calleth, as the Apoſtle ſpeakes,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 11. that is of the good pleaſure of God, who calleth us
with an holy calling, but of him that is called: for depending on
faith it muſt be his whoſe faith is, that doth beleeve: ſecondly,
God cannot have mercy on whom he will have mercy, for the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:155835:43"/>
very purpoſe of it is thus tied to the qualities of faith and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
ſo that he muſt have mercy only on beleevers, antecedent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to his decree, which thirdly, hinders him from being an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
free agent, and doing of what he will with his owne: of
having ſuch a power over us, as the Potter hath over his Clay, for
he findes us of different matter, one clay, another gold, when he
comes to appoint us to different uſes and ends.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, God ſees no ſaith, no obedience, perſeverance; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but ſinne and wickedneſſe in any man, but what himſelfe
intendeth graciouſly and freely to beſtow upon them, for <hi>faith is
not of our ſelves, it is the gift of God, it is the worke of God that we
doe beleeve,</hi> Iohn 6. 29. <hi>he bleſſeth us with all ſpirituall bleſſings in
Chriſt,</hi> Epheſ. 1. Now all theſe gifts and graces, God beſtoweth
onely upon thoſe whom he hath antecedently ordained to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
life: <hi>For the election obtained it and the reſt were blinded,</hi>
Rom. 11. 7. <hi>God added to his Church daily thoſe that ſhould be ſaved,
Acts</hi> 2. 47. therefore ſurely God chooſeth us not, becauſe he
foreſeeth thoſe things in us, ſeeing he beſtoweth thoſe graces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he hath choſen us:<note n="x" place="margin">Non ob aliud dicit non vos me eligiſtis ſed ego vos elegi niſi quia non elege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt eum ut eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geret eos, ſed ut eligerent eum elegit eos: Aug. de bono: perſe. cap. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Wherefore</hi> ſaith <hi>Auſtine, doth Chriſt
ſay, you have not choſen me, but I have choſen you, but becauſe they
did not chuſe him that he ſhould chuſe them: but he choſe them that
they might chuſe him.</hi> We chooſe Chriſt by faith, God chooſeth
us by his decree of election, the queſtion is whether we chooſe
him, becauſe he hath choſen us, or he chooſeth us, becauſe we
have choſen him, and ſo indeed chooſe our ſelves: we affirme
the former, and that becauſe our choyce of him, is a gift he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
beſtoweth onely on them whom he hath choſen.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, and principally, the effects of election infallibly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
it, cannot be the cauſes of election, certainly praeceding it:
this is evident, for nothing can be the cauſe, and the effect, of the
ſame thing; before and after it ſelfe: but all our faith, our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
repentance, good workes, are the effects of election
flowing from it, as their proper fountaine, erected on it, as the
foundation of this ſpirituall building: and for this the Article of
our Church is evident and cleere; <hi>Thoſe,</hi> ſaith it, <hi>that are indued
with this excellent benefit of God, are called according to Gods pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:155835:43"/>
are iuſtified freely, are made the ſonnes of God by adoption, they
be made like the image of Chriſt, they walke religiouſly in good
workes, &amp;c.</hi> Where firſt they are ſaid to be partakers of this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of election, and then by vertue thereof, to be entitled to the
fruition of all thoſe graces: Secondly, it ſaith, <hi>thoſe who are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with this benefit, enioy thoſe bleſſings;</hi> intimating that electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is the rule whereby God proceedeth in beſtowing thoſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
reſtraining the objects of the temporall acts of Gods ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
favour, to them onely whom his eternall decree doth em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace;
both theſe indeed are denied by the <hi>Arminians,</hi> which
maketh a further diſcovery of their <hi>Heterodoxies</hi> in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.
<note n="y" place="margin">Dicis electio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem divinam eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe regulam fidei dandae vel non dandae: ergo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectio non eſt fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delium ſed fides electorum: ſed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>You ſay,</hi> ſaith <hi>Arminius</hi> to <hi>Perkins, that election is the rule of
giving, or not giving of faith, and therefore election is not of the
faithfull, but faith of the elect: but by your leave this I muſt deny:</hi>
but yet what ever it is the ſophiſticall heretique here denies, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
antecedent or concluſion, he fals foule on the word of God:
<hi>they beleeved,</hi> ſaith the holy Ghoſt, <hi>who were ordained to eternall
life,</hi> Act. 3. 48. <hi>And the Lord added daily to his Church ſuch as
ſhould de ſaved,</hi> Act. 2. 47. from both which places it is evident,
that God beſtoweth faith onely on them whom he hath praeor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
eternall life: but moſt cleerely, <hi>Rom. 8. 29, 30. for
whom he did fore-know, he alſo predeſtinated to be conformed to the
Image of his Sonne, moreover, whom he did predeſtinate, them alſo
he called, and whom he called, them he alſo iuſtified, and whom he
iuſtified, them alſo glorified,</hi> Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> interpreted this place,
by adding in every linke of the chaine, <hi>onely thoſe,</hi> how ever the
words directly import a precedency of predeſtination, before the
beſtowing of other graces: and alſo a reſtraint of thoſe graces, to
them onely, that are ſo predeſtinate: Now the inference from
this, is, not onely for the forme Logicall, but for the matter alſo,
it containeth the very words of Scripture, <hi>faith is of Gods elect:
Titus</hi> 1. 1.</p>
               <p>For the other part of the propoſition, that faith and obedience
are the fruits of election, they cannot be more peremptory in its
denyall, then the Scripture is plentifull in its confirmation: <hi>He
hath choſen us in Chriſt, that we ſhould be holy,</hi> Epheſ. 1. 4. not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we were holy, but that we ſhould be ſo: holineſſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:155835:44"/>
faith is the root, and obedience the body, is that whereunto,
and not for which we are elected: the end, and the meritorious
cauſe, of any one act cannot be the ſame, they have divers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects,
and require repugnant conditions: againe we are prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinated
unto the adoption of children by Ieſus Chriſt: <hi>verſ.</hi> 5.
adoption is that whereby we are aſſumed into the family of God,
when before we are forreigners, aliens, ſtrangers, a far off, which
we ſee is a fruit of our predeſtination, though it be the very en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance,
into that eſtate, wherein we begin firſt to pleaſe God in
the leaſt meaſure: of the ſame nature, are all thoſe places of holy
writ which ſpeake of Gods <hi>giving ſome unto Chriſt, of Chriſts

he would never be able to accompliſh his intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but like an unwiſe builder having demoliſhed
the old, before he had ſate downe and caſt up his
account, whether he were able to erect a new, they ſhould (by
his project) be deprived of a Temple: wherefore to ſatisfie
their jealouſies, he reſolved as he tooke downe any part of the
other, preſently to erect a portion of the new in the place there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
Right ſo the <hi>Arminians,</hi> determining to demoliſh the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of divine providence, grace, and favour, by which men have
hitherto aſcended into heaven, and fearing leſt we ſhould be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
finding our ſelves on a ſudden deprived of that wherein we
repoſed our confidence for happineſſe, they have by degrees e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
a Babyloniſh Tower in the roome thereof, whoſe top they
would perſwade us ſhall reach unto heaven: Firſt therefore the
foundation ſtones they bring forth, crying haile, haile, unto them,
and pitch them on the ſandy rotten ground, of our owne natures.
Now becauſe heretofore, ſome wiſe maſter-builders, had diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
this ground, to be very unfit to be the <hi>baſis</hi> of ſuch a lofty
erection, by reaſon of a corrupt iſſue of blood and filth, ariſing in
the middeſt thereof, and over-ſpreading the whole platforme:
to incourage men to an aſſociation in this deſperate attempt, they
proclaime to all, that there is no ſuch evill fountaine in the plaine
which they have choſen, for the foundation of their proud buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
ſetting up it ſelfe againſt the knowledge of God in plaine
termes, having rejected the providence of God, from being the
Originall of that goodneſſe of entity which is in our actions, and
his predeſtination, from being the cauſe of that morall and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall

the latter caſe, being thought to be altogether vaine, becauſe of

others, the <hi>Arminians</hi> have Apoſtated, from the pure doctrine of
the word of God, the conſent of Orthodox Divines, and the
Confeſſion of this Church of England.</p>
               <p>In the ninth Article of our Church, which is concerning ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall
ſinne, I obſerve eſpecially foure things: Firſt, that it is an
inherent evill, the fault and corruption of the nature of every
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:155835:46"/>
man: Secondly, that it is a thing not ſubject, or conformable to
the Law of God: but hath in it ſelfe, even after Baptiſme, the
nature of ſinne: Thirdly, that by it, we are averſe from God and
inclined to all manner of evill: Fourthly, that it deſerveth Gods
wrath and damnation, all which are frequently, and evidently
taught in the word of God, and every one denyed by the <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi>
as it may appeare by theſe inſtances, in ſomeof them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That it is an inherent ſinne and pollution of nature, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

in which laſt expreſſion, theſe bold innovators, with one daſh of
their pens, have quite overthrowne a ſacred verity, an Apoſtolike
Catholike fundamentall Article, of Chriſtian Religion: but truly
to me, there are no ſtronger Arguments of the ſinfull corruption
of our nature, then to ſee, ſuch nefarious iſſues of unſanctified
hearts: let us looke then to the word of God confounding this
Babyloniſh deſigne.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the nature of man, which at firſt was created pure
and holy, after the image of God, endowed with ſuch a rectitude
and righteouſneſſe, as was neceſſary and due unto it, to bring it
unto that ſupernaturall end to which it was ordained, is now alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
corrupted and become abominable, ſinfull and averſe from
goodneſſe, and that this corruption or concupiſcence is originally
inherent in us, and derived from our firſt parents, is plentifully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
in holy writ, as that which chiefly compels us to a ſelf-deniall,
and drives us unto Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Behold, I was ſhapen in iniquitie, and in ſinne did my mother con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
me, <hi>ſaith</hi> David, Pſal. 51. 5.</p>

Where for the praiſe of Gods goodneſſe towards him, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
with the confeſſion of his native perverſeneſſe, and of the
ſinne wherein he was wrapped before he was born: neither was
this peculiar to him alone, he had it not, from the particular ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie
of his next progenitors, but by an ordinary propagation
from the common parent of us all: though in ſome of us, Satan
by this <hi>Pelagian</hi> attempt; by hiding the diſeaſe hath made it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
incurable: for even thoſe infants, of whoſe innocency the
<hi>Arminians</hi> boaſt, <hi>are uncleane in the verdict of</hi> Saint <hi>Paul, 1 Cor.</hi>
7. 14. if not ſanctified by an intereſt in the Promiſe of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and no uncleane thing ſhall enter into the kingdome of
heaven:<note n="d" place="margin">Imbecillitas membrorum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantilium inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens eſt non ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus: Aug.</note> 
                  <hi>The weakneſſe of the members of infants is innocent, and
not their ſouls:</hi> they want nothing, but that the members of their
bodies are not as yet ready inſtruments of ſinne: they are not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
only by an externall denomination, accounted ſo, becauſe of
the imputation of <hi>Adams</hi> actuall tranſgreſſion unto them: for
they have all an <hi>uncleanneſſe</hi> in them by nature, <hi>Iob</hi> 14. 4. from
which they muſt be cleanſed, <hi>by the waſhing of water and the word,
Epheſ.</hi> 5. 20. their whole nature is overſpread with ſuch a pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as is proper only to ſinne inherent, and doth not accompany
ſinne imputed, as we may ſee in the example of our Saviour,
who was pure, immaculate, holy, undefiled, and yet the iniquity
of us all was imputed unto him: hence are thoſe phraſes of <hi>waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away ſinne,</hi> Acts 22. 16. <hi>of cleanſing filth, 1 Pet. 3. 21. Titus</hi>
3. 5. ſomething there is in them, as ſoone as they are borne, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
them from the kingdome of heaven, for <hi>except they alſo
be borne againe of the ſpirit they ſhall not enter into it,</hi> Ioh. 3. 5.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The oppoſition that is made between the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
of Chriſt, and the ſinne of <hi>Adam, Rom.</hi> 5. which is the
proper ſeat of this doctrine, ſheweth that there is in our nature
an inbred ſinfull corruption, for the ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> holds ſuch rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
unto ſinners, proceeding from him by naturall propagation,
as the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, doth unto them, who are borne
againe of him by ſpirituall regeneration: but we are truly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecally
and inherently ſanctified, by the ſpirit and grace of
Chriſt: and therefore there is no reaſon, why being ſo often in
this Chapter called ſinners, becauſe of this originall ſinne, we
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:155835:47"/>
ſhould caſt it off, as if we were concerned only by an externall
denomination, for the right inſtitution of the compariſon, and
its Analogie quite overthrows the ſolitary imputation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, All thoſe places of Scripture, which aſſert the pron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of our nature to all evill, and the utter diſabilitie that is in
us to doe any good, that wretched oppoſition to the power of
godlineſſe, wherewith from the wombe we are repleniſhed,
confirmes the ſame truth: but of theſe places, I ſhall have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to ſpeake hereafter.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The fleſh, in the Scripture phraſe, is a qualitie (if I
may ſo ſay) inherent in us: for <hi>that,</hi> with its concupiſcence, is
oppoſed to the ſpirit and his holineſſe, which is certainly inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
in us: now the whole man by nature is fleſh: <hi>for that which
is borne of the fleſh is fleſh,</hi> Ioh. 3. 6. <hi>it is an inhabiting thing, a
thing that dwelleth within us,</hi> Rom. 7. 17. in briefe this <hi>vitioſity</hi>
ſinfulneſſe, and corruption of our nature, is laid open: Firſt, by
all thoſe places, which caſt an aſperſion of guilt, or deſert of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment;
or of pollution, on nature it ſelfe: as <hi>Epheſ. 2. 1, 2, 3.
We are dead in treſpaſſes, and ſinnes, being by nature children of
wrath, as well as others, being wholly incompaſſed by a ſinne that
doth eaſily beſet us.</hi> Secondly, by them, which fixe this originall
pravitie, in the heart, will, minde, and underſtanding: <hi>Epheſ. 4.
18. Rom. 12. 2. Gen.</hi> 6. 5. Thirdly, by thoſe which poſitively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cypher
this naturall depravation. 1 <hi>Corinth. 2. 14. Rom.</hi> 8. 7. or
Fourthly, that <hi>place</hi> it in the fleſh, or whole man, <hi>Rom. 6. 6. Gal.</hi>
5. 16. ſo that it is not, a bare imputation of anothers fault, but an
intrinſecall adjacent corruption of our nature it ſelfe, that we call
by this name of originall ſinne: but alas, it ſeemes we are too
large carvers for our ſelves, in that wherewith we will not be
contented: the <hi>Arminians</hi> deny all ſuch imputation, as to heavy
a charge, for the pure unblameable condition, wherein they are
brought into this world, they deny I ſay, that they are guiltie of
<hi>Adams</hi> ſinne, as ſinning in him, or that his ſinne is any way impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unto us, which is their ſecond aſſault, upon the truth of this
Article of faith.</p>

                  <hi>For it is againſt equitie, ſaith their

<hi>Pelagianiſme</hi> obtruded on us, without either welt or guard: men
on a ſudden made pure and truly innocent, notwithſtanding all
that naturall pollution and corruption, the Scripture every where
proclaimes them to be repleniſhed withall: neither is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
they intimate, of any value, that their wils aſſented not to it,

                  <hi>It is ſay they againſt

as a ſinne, to any, by whoſe own proper will: it was not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted:</hi>
which being all they have to ſay, they repeat it <hi>over and
over,</hi> in this caſe; <hi>it muſt be voluntary, or it is no ſinne:</hi> but I ſay
this is of no force at all: for firſt, Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in his moſt exact de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition
of ſinne, requires not voluntarineſſe to the nature of it,
but only an obliquitie, a deviation from the rule, it is an anomie, a
diſcrepancie from the Law; which whither voluntary or no, it
skils not much: but ſure enough, there is in our nature ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancie,
to the Law of God: ſo that ſecondly, if originally
we are free from a voluntary actuall tranſgreſſion, yet we are not,
from an habituall voluntary digreſſion, and exorbitancy from the
Law: but thirdly, in reſpect of our wils, we are not thus inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent

now all ſinne is voluntary ſay the Remonſtrants, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

as ours,</hi> by reaſon of the covenant which was made with him on
our behalfe: but becauſe this conſiſting in an imputation, muſt
needs be extrinſecall unto us; therefore ſecondly, we ſay, that
<hi>Adam</hi> being the roote, and head of all humane kinde, and we all
branches from that root, all parts of that body, whereof <hi>he was
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:155835:48"/>
the head,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Omnes eramus unus ille homo: Aug.</note> 
                  <hi>his will may be ſaid to be ours, we were then all that one
man,</hi> we were all in him, and had no other will but his; ſo that
though that be extrinſecall unto us, conſidered as particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
yet it is intrinſecall, as we are all parts of one common na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
as in him we ſinned, ſo in him we had a will of ſinning:
thirdly,<note place="margin">Eſt voluntarium, voluntate primi originantis, non voluntate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trahentis<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ratione naturae, non per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonae: Thom. 1. 2. q. 81. a.</note> 
                  <hi>Originall ſinne, is a defect of nature, and not of this, or that,
particular perſon,</hi> whereon <hi>Alvarez</hi> grounds this difference, of
actuall, and originall ſinne, that the one is alwayes committed by
the proper will of the ſinner, to the other, is required only the
will of our firſt parent, who was the head of humane nature.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It is hereditary naturall, and no way involuntary or
put into us againſt our wils, it poſſeſſeth our wils, and inclines us
to voluntary ſins.</p>
               <p>I ſee no reaſon then, why <hi>Corvinus</hi> ſhould affirme as he doth:
<note n="h" place="margin">Abſurdum eſt ut ex unius obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dientia multi a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctu inobedientes, facti eſſent, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin ad Mol. cap. 7. ſec. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>that it is abſurd, that by one mans diſobedience, many ſhould be

chooſe whom you will beleeve; S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul,</hi> or the <hi>Arminians:</hi>
the ſumme of their indeavour in this particular, is to cleare the
nature of man, from being any way guiltie of <hi>Adams</hi> actuall ſin;
as being then in him, a member and part of that body whereof
he was the head: or from being obnoxious unto an imputation
of it, by reaſon of that Covenant which God made with us all in
him: ſo that denying as you ſaw before, all inherent corruption
and pravitie of nature, and now all participation by any means of
<hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion, me thinks they caſt a great aſperſion on Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty

it ſeemes a hard caſe, that having no obliquitie or ſinne in
our nature to deſerve it, nor no intereſt in his diſobedience,
whoſe obedience had been the means of conveying ſo much hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe
unto us: we ſhould yet be involved in ſo great a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as we are, For that we are not now by birth, under a great

firſt placed <hi>Adam:</hi> and though all the reſt, in their judgement
be no great matter, but an infirmitie and languor of nature or

God would have them all, borne obnoxious to that puniſhment,
which</hi> Adam <hi>incurred by his ſinne: or permitted that evill, which

what it will, never ſo ſmall, yet if we have no demerit of our

we muſt reject from the moſt holy, with a God forbid: farre be
it from the Iudge of all the world to puniſh the righteous with
the ungodly: if God ſhould impute the ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> unto us,
and thereon pronounce us obnoxious to the curſe deſerved by it:
if we have a pure, ſinleſſe, unſpotted nature, even this, could
ſcarſe be reconciled with that rule, of his proceeding in juſtice,
with the ſonnes of men, <hi>the ſoule that ſinneth it ſhall die:</hi> which
clearely granteth an impunity to all not tainted with ſinne. Sinne
and puniſhment, though they are ſometimes ſeparated by his

by his juſtice, inflicting the latter, where the former is not:
ſinne imputed, by it ſelfe alone without an inherent guilt, was
never puniſhed in any, but Chriſt: the unſearchableneſſe of Gods
love and juſtice, in laying the iniquitie of us all upon him, who
had no ſinne, is an exception from that generall rule he walketh
by, in his dealing with the poſteritie of <hi>Adam:</hi> ſo that if puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
bee not due unto us, for a ſolely imputed ſinne, much

to impute any iniquity unto us at all, can we juſtly be wrapped in
ſuch a curſe and puniſhment, as wofull experience teacheth us,
that we lye under. Now in this act of injuſtice wherewith they

by the primarie conſtitution of his nature: nor yet ſuch an eternall
death, as is accompanied with damnation, or everlaſting puniſhment:</hi>
No? Why then let us here learne ſome new Divinitie? Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
have hitherto beleeved, that whatſoever may be compriſed
under the name of death: together with its antecedents, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents,
and attendants was threatned to <hi>Adam,</hi> in this commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation:
and Divines untill this day, can finde but theſe two ſorts
of death in the Scripture, as poenall unto men, and properly ſo
called: and ſhall we now be perſwaded that it was neither of
theſe that was threatned unto <hi>Adam?</hi> in muſt be ſo, if we will
beleeve the <hi>Arminians:</hi> it was neither the one, nor the other,
of the former: but whereas he was created mortall and ſubject
to a temporall death, the ſanction of his obedience, was a threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the utter diſſolution of his ſoule and body, or a reduction
to their primative nothing: but what if a man will not here
take them at their words, but beleeve according to Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
that death entred by ſinne; that if we had never ſinned, we had
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:155835:50"/>
never died, that man in the ſtate of innocency was by Gods con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
free even from temporall death, and all things directly
conducing thereunto. Secondly, that this death threatned to our
firſt parents, comprehended damnation alſo of ſoule and body for
evermore, and that of their imaginarie diſſolution, there is not the
leaſt intimation in the word of God: why I confeſſe they have
impudence enough in divers places to begge that we would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
their aſſertions, but never confidence enough, to venture
once to prove them true. Now they who make ſo ſlight of the

obſervations will declare.</p>
               <p>Firſt, there is no confuſion, no diſorder, no vanitie in the
whole world, in any of Gods creatures, that is not a puniſhment
of our ſinne in <hi>Adam.</hi> That great and almoſt univerſall ruine of
Nature, proceeding from the curſe of God overgrowing the
earth, and the wrath of God, revealing it ſelfe from heaven,
is the proper iſſue of his tranſgreſſion. It was of the great mercy
of God, that the whole frame of Nature, was not preſently rolled
up in darkeneſſe, and reduced to its primitive confuſion. Had we
our ſelves, beene deprived of thoſe remaining ſparkes of Gods
Image in our ſoules, which vindicates us from the number, of the
Beaſts that periſh, had we beene all borne fooles, and voyd of
reaſon, by dealing ſo, with ſome in particular, he ſheweth us, it
had beene but juſtice to have wrapped us in the ſame miſerie, all
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:155835:51"/>
in generall: all things when God firſt created them, were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
good, and thought ſo by the wiſedome of God himſelfe:
but our ſinne, even compelled that good and wiſe Creator, to
hate, and curſe the worke of his owne hands: <hi>Curſed is the
ground,</hi> ſaith he to <hi>Adam, for thy ſake, in ſorrow ſhalt thou eate of
it all the dayes of thy life: thornes alſo and thiſtles ſhall it bring
forth unto thee:</hi> Gen. 3. 17, 18. hence was that heavie burden of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
that bondage of <hi>corruption, under which to this day the whole
Creation groaneth, and travelleth in paine untill it be delivered:</hi>
Rom. 8. 21, 22. Now if our ſinne, had ſuch a ſtrange malignant
influence, upon thoſe things, which have no relation unto us, but
onely as they were created for our uſe; ſurely it is of the great
mercy of God that we our ſelves are not quite confounded:
which doth not yet ſo interpoſe it ſelf, but that we are all compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
with divers ſad effects of this iniquitie, lying actually, under
divers preſſing miſeries, and deſervedly obnoxious to everlaſting
deſtruction: ſo that,</p>
               <p>Secondly, death temporall, with all its antecedents, and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants,
all infirmities, miſeries, ſickneſſes, waſting deſtroying
paſſions, caſualties that are poenall, all evill conducing thereunto,
or waiting on it, is a puniſhment of originall ſinne: and this not
onely, becauſe the firſt actuall ſinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> is imputed to us:
but moſt of them, are the proper iſſues of that native corruption,
and pollution of ſinne, which is ſtirring and operative within us,
for the production of ſuch ſad effects, our whole nature being by
it throughly defiled: hence are all the diſtortures, and diſtempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratures
of the ſoule, by luſts, concupiſcence, paſſions, blindneſſe
of minde, perverſeneſſe of will; inordinateneſſe of affections,
wherewith we are preſſed, and turmoiled: even proper iſſues
of that inherent ſinne, which poſſeſſeth our whole ſoules.</p>
               <p>Vpon the body alſo, it hath ſuch an influence, in diſpoſing it to
corruption and mortality, as it the originall of all thoſe infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
ſickneſſes and diſeaſes, which make us nothing but a ſhop
of ſuch miſeries: for death it ſelfe, as theſe and the like degrees,
are the ſteps which leade us on apace, in the road that tends unto
it: ſo they are the direct internall efficient cauſe thereof, in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination,
to the juſtice of Almighty God by ſuch meanes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:155835:51"/>
it as a puniſhment of our ſinnes in <hi>Adam.</hi> Man before
his fall, though not in regard of the matter whereof he was
made, nor yet meerely in reſpect of his quickning forme, yet in
regard of Gods ordination was immortall, a keeper of his owne
everlaſtingneſſe: Death, to which before he was not obnoxious,
was threatned as a puniſhment of his ſinne: <hi>In the day, thou eateſt
thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely die:</hi> the expoſition of which words, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by God, at the time of his inflicting this puniſhment, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
man ſubject to mortalitie, cleerely ſheweth that it
comprehendeth temporall death alſo, <hi>duſt thou art, and unto duſt
thou ſhalt returne:</hi> our returne to duſt, is nothing but the ſoules
leaving the body, whereby before it was preſerved from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.
Further Saint <hi>Paul</hi> oppoſeth that death, we had by the
ſinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> to the reſurrection of the body, by the power of
Chriſt: for ſince by man came death, by man alſo came the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
from the dead, <hi>For as in Adam all die, ſo in Chriſt ſhall
all be made alive:</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 21. 22. the life, which all ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
by the power of Chriſt at the laſt day, is eſſentially a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union
of ſoule and body, and therefore their ſeparation is a thing
we incurred by the ſinne of <hi>Adam:</hi> the ſame Apoſtle alſo, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.
deſcribeth an univerſall reigne of death over all, by reaſon of the
firſt tranſgreſſion: even diſeaſes alſo in the Scripture are attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unto ſinne, as their meritorious cauſe, <hi>Iohn 5. 14. 1 Cor. 11.
30. Revel.</hi> 2. 22. and in reſpect of all theſe, the mercy of God,
doth not ſo interpoſe it ſelfe, but that all the ſonnes of men are in
ſome ſort partakers of them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the finall deſert of originall ſinne, as our article ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
is damnation: the wrath of God to be poured on us, in eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
torments of body and ſoule. To this end alſo many praevious
judgements of God, are ſubſervient: as the privation of origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
righteouſneſſe, which he tooke, and withheld, upon <hi>Adams</hi>
throwing it away: ſpirituall deſertion, permiſſion of ſinne, with
all other deſtroying depravations of our nature, as farre as they
are meerely paenall: ſome of which, are immediate conſequents
of <hi>Adams</hi> ſingular actuall tranſgreſſion, as privation of originall
righteouſneſſe, others as damnation it ſelfe, the proper effects
of that derived ſinne and pollution, that is in us; there is none
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:155835:52"/>
damned, but for their owne ſinne: when Divines affirme that
by <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne we are guilty of damnation, they doe not meane,
that any are actually damned for his particular fact, but that by
his ſinne, and our ſinning in him, by Gods moſt juſt ordination,
we have contracted that exceeding pravitie, and ſinfulneſſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which deſerveth the curſe of God, and eternall damnation:
it muſt be an inherent uncleaneſſe that actually excludes out of
the kingdome of heaven: <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. 27. which uncleanneſſe the
Apoſtle ſhewes, to be in infants not ſanctified, by an intereſt in
the Covenant: in briefe, <hi>we are baptized unto the remiſſion of
ſinne, that we may be ſaved,</hi> Act. 2. 38. that then which is taken
away by Baptiſme, is that which hinders our ſalvation, which is
not, the firſt ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> imputed, but our owne inherent luſt
and pollution: we cannot be waſhed, and cleanſed, and purged
from an imputed ſinne, which is done by the layer of regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
from that which lies upon us, onely by an externall denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
we have no need of cleanſing: we may be ſaid, to be
freed from it, or juſtified, but not purged; the ſoule then that is
guilty of ſinne ſhall die, and that for its owne guilt: if God
ſhould condemne us for originall ſinne onely, it were not by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the imputation of <hi>Adams fault,</hi> but of the iniquitie of that
portion of nature, in which we are proprietaries.</p>
               <p>Now here to ſhut up all, obſerve, that in this inquiry, of the
deſert of originall ſinne: the Queſtion is not, What ſhall be the
certaine lot, of thoſe that depart this life, under the guilt of this
ſin only? but what this haereditary and and native corruption doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſrve,
in all thoſe in whom it is: for as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>we iudge
not them that are without</hi> (eſpecially infants:) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 13. but
for the demerit of it in the juſtice of God, our Saviour expreſly
affirmeth, that unleſſe a man be borne againe, <hi>he cannot enter into
the kingdome of heaven:</hi> Iohn 3. and let them that can; diſtinguiſh
betweene a not going to heaven, and a going to hell: a third re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle
of ſoules in the Scripture we finde not; Saint <hi>Paul</hi> alſo
tels us, that by <hi>nature we are children of wrath:</hi> Epheſ. 2. 3. even
originally and actually, we are guilty of, and obnoxious unto that
wrath, which is accompanied with fiery indignation, that ſhall
conſume the adverſaries: againe, we are aſſured <hi>that no uncleane
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:155835:52"/>
thing ſhall enter into heaven:</hi> Revel. 21. with which hell-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
uncleaneſſe children are polluted, and therefore unleſſe it
be purged with the bloud of Chriſt, they have no intereſt in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
happineſſe: by this meanes ſinne is come upon all to
condemnation, and yet doe we not peremptorily cenſure to hell,
all infants departing this world without the layer of regeneration,
the ordinary means of waveing the puniſhment, due to this pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution:
that is the Queſtion <hi>de facto,</hi> which we before rejected:
yea, and two wayes there are, whereby God ſaveth ſuch infants,
ſnatching them like brands out of the fire.</p>
               <p>Firſt, by intereſting them into the Covenant, if their imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate,
or remote parents have beene beleevers: he is a God of
them, and of their ſeed: extending his mercy unto a thouſand
generations of them that feare him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by his grace of election, which is moſt free and not
tied to any conditions, by which I make no doubt, but God ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
many unto him in Chriſt, whoſe parents never knew, or had
beene deſpiſers of the Goſpel: and this is the doctrine of our
Church, agreeable to the Scripture, affirming the deſert of origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
ſinne, to be Gods wrath and damnation, to both which how
oppoſite is the <hi>Arminian</hi> doctrine may thus appeare.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the laſt Chapter we diſcovered the <hi>Arminian</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
of readvancing the corrupted nature of
man, into that ſtate of innocency and holineſſe,
wherein it was at firſt, by God created: in which
deſigne, becauſe they cannot but diſcerne that the
ſucceſſe is not anſwerable to their deſires, and not being able to
deny, but that for ſo much good as we want, having caſt it away,
or evill of ſinne that we are ſubject unto, more then we were at
our firſt creation, we muſt be reſponſable for to the juſtice of
God; they labour to draw down our firſt parents, even from the
inſtant of their forming, into the ſame condition wherein we
are ingaged by reaſon of corrupted nature: but truly I feare, they
will ſcarſe obtaine ſo proſperous an iſſue of their endeavour, as
<hi>Mahomet</hi> had, when he promiſed the people, he would call a
mountaine unto him: which miracle when they aſſembled to
behold, but the mountaine would not ſtirre for all his calling, he
replyed, if the mountaine will not come to <hi>Mahomet, Mahomet</hi>
will goe to the mountaine, and away he packed towards it, but
we ſhall finde that our <hi>Arminians,</hi> can neither themſelves, climbe
the high mountaine of innocency, nor yet call it down, into the
valley of ſinne and corruption, wherein they are lodged: we
have ſeene already, how vaine and fruſtrate was their former at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt:
let us now take a view of their aſpiring inſolence, in
making the pure creatures of God, holy and undefiled with any
ſinne, to be inveſted with the ſame wretchedneſſe and perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of nature, with our ſelves.</p>
               <p>It is not my intention, to enter into any curious diſcourſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the ſtate and grace of <hi>Adam</hi> before his fall: but only to
give a faithfull aſſent, to what God himſelfe affirmed of all the
works of his hands, they were exceeding good: no evill, no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:155835:54"/>
or any thing tending thereunto, did immediately iſſue,
from that fountaine of goodneſſe and wiſdome, and therefore
doubtleſſe man, the moſt excellent worke of his hands, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
glory of his Creator, was then without ſpot or blemiſh, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with all thoſe perfections, his nature, and ſtate of obedience,
was capable of: and carefull we muſt be, of caſting any aſperſions
of defect on him, that we will not with equall boldneſſe aſcribe
to the image of God?</p>
               <p>Nothing doth more manifeſt the deviation of our nature, from
its firſt inſtitution, and declare the corruption wherewith we are
polluted, then that propenſitie which is in us to every thing that
is evill, that inclination of the fleſh, which luſteth alwayes againſt
the ſpirit, that luſt and concupiſcence, which fomenteth, concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth,
hatcheth, bringeth forth, and nouriſheth ſinne: that perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
proneneſſe that is in unregenerate nature, to every thing,
that is contrary to the pure and holy Law of God: now becauſe
neither Scripture nor experience, will ſuffer Chriſtians quite to
deny this pravitie of our nature, this averſeneſſe from all good,
and propenſitie to ſinne, the <hi>Arminians</hi> extenuate it, as much as
they are able: affirming that it is no great matter; no more then
<hi>Adam,</hi> was ſubject unto, in the ſtate of innocency: but what?
did God create in <hi>Adam,</hi> a proneneſſe unto evill? was that a part
of his glorious image, in whoſe likeneſſe he was framed? yea,

               <p>The ſumme is, man was created with a nature, not only weak
and imperfect, unable by its native ſtrength, and endowments to
attaine that ſupernaturall end, for which he was made, and which
he was commanded to ſeeke, but depraved alſo, with a love and
deſire of things repugnant to the will of God, by reaſon of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
inclination to ſinning. It doth not properly belong to this
place, to ſhew, how they extenuate thoſe gifts alſo, with which
they cannot deny, but that he was indued, and alſo deny thoſe
which he had: as a power to beleeve in Chriſt, or to aſſent unto
any truth, that God ſhould reveale unto him: and yet they grant
this priviledge, to every one of his poſterity, in that depraved con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of nature, whereinto by ſinne he caſt himſelfe and us: we
have all now a power of beleeving in Chriſt, that is, <hi>Adam</hi> by his
fall obtained a ſupernaturall endowment, farre more excellent,
then any he had before; and let them not here, pretend the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſalitie
of the new covenant, untill they can prove it, and I am
certaine it will be long enough: but this I ſay, belongs not to this
place: only let us ſee, how from the word of God, we may o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow,
the former odious hereſie.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:155835:55"/>
                  <hi>God in the beginning created man in his owne image,</hi> Gen. 1. 26. that
is, <hi>upright:</hi> Eccleſ. 7. 29. indued with a nature compoſed to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
and holineſſe: that habituall grace, and originall righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe,
wherewith he was inveſted, was in a manner due
unto him, for the obtaining of that ſupernaturall end, whereunto
he was created: an univerſall rectitude of all the faculties of his
ſoule, advanced by ſupernaturall graces, enabling him to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of thoſe duties whereunto they were required, is that
which we call the innocency of our firſt parents: our nature was
then enclined to good only, and adorned with all thoſe qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that were neceſſary, to make it acceptable unto God, and
able to doe what was required of us by the law, under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of everlaſting happineſſe. Nature, and grace, or originall
righteouſneſſe, before the fall, ought not to be ſo diſtinguiſhed, as
if the one were a thing prone to evill, reſiſted and quelled by the
other: for both complyed in a ſweet union and harmony, to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
us along in the way of obedience, to eternall bleſſedneſſe: no
contention betweene the fleſh and the ſpirit, but as all other
things at theirs, ſo the whole man joyntly aymed at his own chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
good: having all means of attaining it in his power: that
there was then no inclination to ſinne, no concupiſcence of that
which is evill, no repugnancy to the Law of God, in the pure na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of man: is proved, becauſe</p>
               <p>Firſt, The Scripture deſcribing the condition of our nature, at
the firſt creation thereof, intimates no ſuch propenſitie to evill,
but rather an holy perfection, quite excluding it: we are created
in <hi>the image of God,</hi> Gen. 1. 27. in ſuch a <hi>perfect uprightneſſe,</hi> as is
oppoſite to all <hi>evill inventions,</hi> Eccleſ. 7. 29. to which image, when
we are againe in ſome <hi>meaſure renewed, by the grace of Chriſt,</hi>
Coloſ. 3. 10. <hi>We ſee by the firſt fruits, that it conſiſted in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and holineſſe; in truth and perfect holineſſe.</hi> Epheſ. 4. 24.</p>
               <p>Secondly, An inclination to evill, and a luſting after that which
is forbidden, is that inordinate concupiſcence, wherewith our
nature is now infected, which is every where in the Scripture
condemned as a ſinne: Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the ſeventh to the <hi>Romans,</hi>
affirming expreſſely that it is a ſinne, and forbidden by the Law:
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:155835:55"/>
                  <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. producing all manner of evill, and hindering all that is
good: <hi>a body of death: verſ.</hi> 24 and Saint <hi>Iames</hi> maketh it even
the wombe of all iniquitie, <hi>Iames</hi> 1. 14, 15. ſurely, our nature was
not at firſt yoked with ſuch a troubleſome inmate; where is the
uprightneſſe and innocency we have hitherto conceived our firſt
parents to have enjoyed before the fall? a repugnancy to the
law muſt needs be a thing ſinfull: an inclination to evill, to a thing
forbidden, is an anomie, a deviation, and diſcrepancy from the
pure and holy law of God: we muſt ſpeake no more then of the
ſtate of innocency, but only of a ſhort ſpace, wherein no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
actuall ſins, were committed: their proper root, if this be
true was concreated with our nature: is this that <hi>obedientiall har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi>
to all the commandements of God, which is neceſſary for
a pure and innocent creature, that hath a law preſcribed unto him?
by which of the ten precepts, is this inclination to evill required?
is it by the laſt, thou ſhalt not covet? or by that ſumme of them
all, thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, &amp;c. is
this all the happineſſe of Paradiſe? to be turmoyled with a nature
ſwelling with aboundance of vaine deſires? and with a maine
ſtreame carried headlong to all iniquitie, if its violent appetite be
not powerfully kept in by the bit and bridle of originall righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe?

               <p>Thirdly, and principally, whence had our primitive nature this

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He ſumme of thoſe Controverſies, wherewith the
<hi>Arminians,</hi> and their abettors have troubled the
Church, about the death of Chriſt, may be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to heads. Firſt, concerning the object of
his merit, or whom he died for. Secondly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the efficacie and end of his death, or what he deſerved,
procured, merited, and obtained, for them for whom he died:
in reſolution of the firſt, they affirme, that he died for all, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one,: of the ſecond, that he died for no one man at all; in
that ſenſe, Chriſtians have hitherto beleeved that he laid downe
his life, and ſubmitted himſelfe to beare the burden of his Fathers
wrath, for their ſakes. It ſeemes to me a ſtrange extenuation of
the merit of Chriſt, to teach, that no good at all by his death doth
redound to divers of them for whom he died: what participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in the benefit of his ſuffering, had <hi>Pharaoh</hi> or <hi>Judas?</hi> doe
they not at this houre, and ſhall they not to eternitie, feele the
waite and burden of their owne ſinnes? had they either grace
in this world, or glory in the other, that they ſhould be ſaid to
have an intereſt in the death of our Saviour? Chriſtians have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
beleeved, that for whom Chriſt died, for their ſinnes he
made ſatisfaction; that they themſelves ſhould not externally ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
for them: is God uniſt to puniſh twice, for the ſame fault?
his owne Sonne once? and againe the poore ſinners, for whom
he ſuffered? I cannot conceive an intention in God, that Chriſt
ſhould ſatisfie his juſtice for the ſinne of them, that were in hell
ſome thouſands of yeeres before, and yet be ſtill reſolved to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
then puniſhment on them to all eternitie? no doubtleſſe;
Chriſt giveth life to everyone, for whom he gave his life: hee
looſeth not one of them, whom he purchaſed with his blood.</p>
               <p>The firſt part of this Controverſie, may be handled, under
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:155835:57"/>
theſe two queſtions. Firſt, whether God giving his Sonne, and
Chriſt making his ſoule a ranſome for ſinne, intended thereby
to redeeme all and every one, from their ſins, that all and every
one alike, from the beginning of the world, to the laſt day, ſhould
all equally be partakers of the fruits of his death and paſſion;
which purpoſe of theirs is in the moſt fruſtrate. Secondly, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
God had not a certaine infallible intention, of gathering un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
himſelfe a choſen people, of collecting a Church of firſt borne,
of ſaving his little flocke, of bringing ſome certainly to happineſſe,
by the death of his onely Sonne, which in the event he doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh:</p>
               <p>The ſecond part alſo may be reduced to theſe two heads: firſt,
whether Chriſt did not make full ſatisfaction, for all their ſinnes
for whom he died, and merited glory, or everlaſting happineſſe,
to be beſtowed on them, upon the performance of thoſe condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
God ſhould require? Secondly, (which is the proper Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie
I ſhall chiefly inſiſt upon,) whether Chriſt did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
for his own people, a power to become the Sonnes of God,
merit and deſerve at the hands of God for them, grace, faith,
righteouſneſſe, and ſanctification, whereby they may be enabled
infallibly, to performe the conditions of the new Covenant, upon
the which, they ſhall be admitted to glory.</p>
               <p>To the firſt Queſtion, of the firſt part of the Controverſie, the
<hi>Arminians</hi> anſwer affirmatively, to wit, that Chriſt died for all
alike, the benefit of his Paſſion, belongs equally to all the poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
of <hi>Adam:</hi> and to the ſecond negatively, that God had no
ſuch intention of bringing many choſen ſonnes unto ſalvation, by
the death of Chriſt; but determined of grace and glory, no more
preciſely to one, then to another, to <hi>Iohn,</hi> then <hi>Iudas, Abraham,</hi>
then <hi>Pharaoh:</hi> both which as the learned <hi>Moulin</hi> obſerved,
<note n="a" place="margin">Molin ſuffrag. ad Synod. Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra.</note> 
                  <hi>ſeeme to be invented to make Chriſtianitie ridiculous,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
our Religion, to the deriſion, of all knowing men: for who
can poſſibly conceive that one by the appointment of God ſhould
die for another; and yet that other, by the ſame juſtice be allotted
unto death himſelfe, when ones death onely was due: that
Chriſt hath made a full ſatisfaction for their ſinnes, who ſhall ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly
feele the waight of them, themſelves; that he ſhould
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:155835:57"/>
merit and obtaine reconciliation with God for them, who live
and die his enemies: grace and glory for them, who are grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
in this life, and damned in that which is to come: that he
ſhould get remiſſion of ſinnes for them, whoſe ſinnes were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
pardoned: in briefe, if this ſentence be true, either Chriſt
by his death did not reconcile us unto God, make ſatisfaction to
his juſtice for our iniquities, redeeme us from our ſinnes, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
a kingdome, an everlaſting inheritance for us, which, I
hope no Chriſtian will ſay, or elſe all the former abſurdities muſt
neceſſarily follow, which no rationall man will ever admit.</p>
               <p>Neither may we be charged, as ſtraitners of the merit of
Chriſt: for we advance the true value and worth thereof, (as
hereafter will appeare,) farre beyond all, that the <hi>Arminians</hi>
aſcribe unto it: we confeſſe that, <hi>that blood of God,</hi> Acts 20. 28.
<hi>of the Lambe without ſpot or blemiſh,</hi> 1. Pet. 1. 19. was ſo exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
precious, of that infinite <hi>worth and value,</hi> that it might have
ſaved a thouſand beleeving worlds, <hi>Iohn 3. 16. Rom.</hi> 3. 22. his
death was of ſufficient dignitie, to have beene made a ranſome,
for all the ſinnes of every one in the world: and on this internall
ſufficiencie of his death and paſſion, is grounded the univerſalitie
of Evangelicall promiſes, which have no ſuch reſtriction in their
own nature, as that they ſhould not be made to all, and every one,
though the promulgation and knowledge of them, is tied onely
to the good pleaſure of Gods ſpeciall providence, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 17.
as alſo that <hi>Oeconomie,</hi> and diſpenſation of the new Covenant,
whereby the partition wall being broken downe, there remaines
no more difference betweene <hi>Iew,</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> the utmoſt bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of the Earth being given in for Chriſts inheritance: ſo that
in ſome ſenſe, Chriſt may be ſaid to die for all, and the whole
world: firſt, in as much as the worth and value of his death, was
very ſufficient to have beene made a price for all their ſinnes:
ſecondly, in as much as this word All, is taken for ſome of all ſorts,
not for every one, of every ſort, as it is frequently uſed in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scripture, ſo Chriſt <hi>being lifted up drew all unto him,</hi> Iohn 12.
32. that is, beleevers out of all ſorts of men: the Apoſtles cured
all diſeaſes, or ſome of all ſorts, they did not cure every particular
diſeaſe, but there was no kinde of diſeaſe, that was exempted
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:155835:58"/>
from their power of healing: ſo that where it is ſaid, that Chriſt
died for all, it is meant either; firſt, all the faithfull; or ſecondly,
ſome of all ſorts; thirdly, not onely <hi>Iewes,</hi> but <hi>Gentiles:</hi> For,</p>
               <p>Secondly, the proper counſell and intention of God, in ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Sonne into the world, to die, was, that thereby he might
confirme and ratifie, the new Covenant to his elect: and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
for them, all the good things, which are contained in the
tenure of that Covenant: to wit, grace, and glory: that by his
death, he might bring many, (yet ſome certaine) children to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
obtaining for them, that were given unto him, by his Father,
that is, his whole Church, reconciliation with God, remiſſion of
ſinnes, faith, righteouſneſſe, ſanctification and life eternall: that
is, the end, to which they are to be brought, and the meanes
whereby God will have them attaine it: he died that he might
gather the diſperſed children of God, and make them partakers
of everlaſting glory, to give eternall life, <hi>to all that God gave unto
him,</hi> Iohn 17. 2. And on this purpoſe, of himſelfe, and his Father,
is founded the interceſſion of Chriſt, for his elect and choſen
people, performed partly on the earth, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. partly in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
before the Throne of grace: which is nothing but a preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of himſelfe, and his merits, accompanied with the prayers
of his Mediatour-ſhip, before God: that he would be pleaſed to
grant, and effectually to apply, the good things, he hath by them
obtained, to all for whom he hath obtained them: his interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
in heaven, is nothing but a continued oblation of himſelfe. So
that whatſoever Chriſt impetrated, merited, or obtained, by his
death and paſſion, muſt be infallibly applied unto, and beſtowed
upon them, for whom he intended to obtaine it: or elſe his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion
is vaine, he is not heard in the prayers of his media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourſhip:
an actuall reconciliation with God, and communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of grace and glory, muſt needs betide all them that have any
ſuch intereſt in the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, as to have it accepted
for their good: the ſole end, why Chriſt would ſo dearely pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
thoſe good things, is an actuall application of them, unto his
choſen: <hi>God ſet forth the propitiation of his blood, for the remiſſion
of ſinnes. that he might be the iuſtifier of him that beleeveth on Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus:</hi>
Rom, 3. 25, 26. But this part of the Controverſie is not that
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:155835:58"/>
which I principally intend: onely I will give you a briefe ſumme,
of thoſe reaſons which overthrow their hereſie, in this particular
branch thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, the death of Chriſt, is in divers places of the Scripture
reſtrained</hi> to his people, <hi>and</hi> elect, <hi>his</hi> Church, and ſheepe: <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.
21. Iohn 10. 11, 12, 13. Acts 20. 28. Epheſ. 5. 25. Iohn 11. 52.
Rom. 8. 32, 33. Heb 2. 10. 13. Revel. 5. 9. Dan. 9. 27. <hi>and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the good purchaſed thereby, ought not to be extended,</hi> to
dogges, reprobates, and thoſe that are without.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for whom Chriſt died, he died as their ſponſor, in
their roome and turne, that he might free them from the guilt,
and deſert of death, which is cleerely expreſſed, <hi>Rom. 5. 6, 7, 8.
He was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, he was bruiſed for our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquities,
the chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him, and with his
ſtripes, we are healed:</hi> Iſa. 53. 5, 6, &amp;c. <hi>He hath redeemed us, from
the curſe, being made a curſe for us:</hi> Galat. 3. 13. <hi>He made him to
be ſinne for us, who knew no ſinne,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 21. Evidently he chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
turnes with us, that we might be made the righteouſneſſe of
God in him: yea in other things, it is plaine in the Scripture, that
to die for another, is to take his place and roome, with an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that he ſhould live: 2 <hi>Sam, 18. 33. Rom.</hi> 5. So that Chriſt dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for men, made ſatisfaction, for their ſins, that they ſhould not
die: now for what ſins he made ſatisfaction, for them the juſtice
of God is ſatisfied, which ſurely is not done for the ſinnes of the
reprobates, becauſe he juſtly puniſheth them to eternitie, upon
themſelves: <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 26.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, for whom Chriſt died, for them alſo he roſe againe,
to make interceſſion for them, <hi>for whoſe offences he was deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
for their iuſtification he was raiſed:</hi> Rom. 4. 25. and Chap. 5.
10. <hi>He is a high Prieſt to make interceſſion for them in the holieſt
of holies, for whom by his bloud he obtained everlaſting redemption,
Heb.</hi> 9. 11. 12. Thoſe two acts of his Prieſthood are not to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated,
it belongs to the ſame Mediator for ſinne, to ſacrifice and
pray: our aſſurance that he is our Advocate, is grounded on his
being a propitiation for our ſinnes: he is an Advocate, for every
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:155835:59"/>
one, <hi>for whoſe ſinnes his blood was a propitiation: 1 Iohn</hi> 2, 1, 2.
But Chriſt doth not intercede, and pray for all, as himſelfe <hi>often
witneſſeth:</hi> Iohn 17. He maketh interceſſion onely for them,
<hi>who come unto God by him:</hi> Heb. 7. 24. He is not a Mediatour of
them that periſh, no more then and Advocate of them that faile
in their ſuits, and therefore the benefit of his death alſo muſt be
reſtrained to them, who are finally partakers of both: we muſt
not ſo diſ-joyne the offices of Chriſts Mediatorſhip, that one of
them may be verſated about ſome towards whom he exerciſeth
not the other: much leſſe ought we, ſo to ſeparate the ſeverall
acts of the ſame office. For whom Chriſt is a Prieſt, to offer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
a ſacrifice, for their ſinnes, he is ſurely a King, to apply the
good things purchaſed by his death unto them, <hi>asb</hi> 
                  <hi>Arminius
himſelfe</hi> confeſſeth; much more to whom he is a Prieſt by ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
he will be a Prieſt by interceſſion: and therefore, ſeeing
he doth not intercede and pray for every one, he did not die
for every one.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, for whom Chriſt died, he merited grace, and glory,
faith, and ſalvation, and reconciliation with God, as I ſhall ſhew
hereafter; but this he hath not done for all, and every one: many
doe never beleeve, the wrath of God remaineth upon ſome, the
wrath of <hi>God abideth on them that doe not beleeve:</hi> 1 Iohn 3. 16.
To abide, argueth a continued uninterrupted act: now to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
to one, and yet to lie under his heavie anger, ſeeme to
me <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, things that will ſcarce conſiſt together: the reaſons
are many, I onely point at the heads of ſome of them.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Chriſt died for them, whom God gave unto him, to
be ſaved, <hi>Thine they were, and thou gaveſt them unto me:</hi> Ioh. 17. 6.
<hi>He layeth downe his life, for the ſheepe committed to his charge:
Iohn</hi> 10. 11. But all are not the ſheepe of Chriſt, all are not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
unto him of God, to be brought to glory: for of thoſe that are
ſo given, there is not one that periſheth, for <hi>he giveth eternall life
to as many as God hath given him:</hi> Iohn 17. 2. <hi>No man is able to
plucke them out of his Fathers hands:</hi> Chap. 10. 28, 29.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, looke whom, and how many, that love of God em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:155835:59"/>
that was the cauſe of ſending his Son to redeeme them:
for them, and ſo many, did Chriſt according to the counſell of
his Father, and in himſelfe intentionally, lay downe his life:
now this love is not univerſall, being his good pleaſure of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
with ſpirituall bleſſings and ſaving ſome in Chriſt: <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.
4, 5. which good pleaſure of his, evidently comprehendeth ſome,
when others are excluded, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 25, 26. yea the love of
God in giving Chriſt for us is of the ſame extent, with that grace,
whereby he calleth us to faith, or beſtoweth faith on us: <hi>for he
hath called us with an holy calling, according to his owne purpoſe
and grace, which was given us in Ieſus Chriſt:</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 9. which
doubtleſſe is not univerſall and common unto all.</p>
               <p>Innumerable other reaſons there are to prove, that ſeeing God
hath given his elect onely, whom onely he loved to Chriſt to
be redeemed: and ſeeing that the Sonne loveth onely thoſe
who are given him of his Father, and redeemeth onely whom he
loveth: ſeeing alſo that the holy Spirit, the love of the Father
and the Sonne, ſanctifieth all, and onely them that are elected,
and redeemed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is not our part, with a prepoſterous liberality
againſt the witneſſe of Chriſt himſelfe, to aſſigne the ſalvation
attained by him, as due to them, that are with out the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of them whom the Father hath loved, and choſen:
without that Church, which the Sonne loved and gave his
life for it, nor none of the members of that ſanctified body,
whereof Chriſt is the Head and Saviour: I urge no more,
becauſe this is not that part of the Controverſie that I deſire to
lay open.</p>
               <p>I come now to conſider the maine Queſtion of this difference,
though ſparingly handled by our Divines: concerning what our
Saviour merited, and purchaſed for them for whom he died:
and here you ſhall finde the old Idol playing his prankes, and quite
deveſting the merit of Chriſt, from the leaſt ability or power, of
doing us any good; for though the <hi>Arminians</hi> pretend very ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly,
that Chriſt died for all men: yet in effect, they make him
die for no one man at all: and that by denying the effectuall ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:155835:60"/>
of his death, and aſcribing the proper iſſues of his paſſion,
to the brave indevours of their owne <hi>Pelagian</hi> Deitie.</p>
               <p>We (according to the Scriptures) plainly beleeve, that Chriſt
hath by his righteouſneſſe, merited for us grace and glory; that
we are bleſſed with all ſpirituall bleſſings, in, though, and for
him: that he is made unto us righteouſneſſe, and ſanctification,
and redemption; that he hath procured for us, and that God for
his ſake, beſtoweth on us every grace, in this life, that maketh us
differ from others, and all that glory we hope for, in that which
is to come: he procured for us remiſſion of all our ſinnes, an actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
reconciliation with God, faith, and obedience: yea, but this
is ſuch a deſperate doctrine, as ſtabs at the very heart of the Idol:
and would make him as altogether uſeleſſe, as if he were but a
figgetree logge: what remaineth for him to doe, if all things in
this great worke of our ſalvation, muſt be thus aſcribed unto
Chriſt, and the merit of his death? Wherefore the worſhippers
of this great God, <hi>Lib. Arbit.</hi> oppoſe their engines againſt the
whole fabricke, and cry downe the title of Chriſts merits, to
theſe ſpirituall bleſſings, in the behalfe of their imaginarie Deity.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe they are things of a two-fold denomination, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
which we contend, before the king of heaven; each part
producing their evidence; the firſt ſpringing from the favour of
God towards us: the ſecond from the working of his grace, actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
within us, I ſhall handle them ſeverally, and apart: eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
becauſe to things of this latter ſort, gifts, as we call them, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling
us to fulfill the condition, required, for the attaining of
glory, we lay a double claime, on Gods behalfe: Firſt, as the death
of Chriſt, is the meritorious cauſe procuring them of him: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
as his free grace is their efficient cauſe working them in
us; they alſo producing a double title, whereby, they would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt
their beloved darling, with a ſole proprietie in cauſing theſe
effects. Firſt, in regard that they are our owne acts performed
in us, and by us: ſecondly, as they are parts of our dutie, which
we are enjoyned to doe, ſo that the quarrell is directly betweene
Chriſts Merits and our owne free-will, about procuring the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:155835:60"/>
favour of God, and obtaining grace and righteouſneſſe, let us ſee
what they ſay to the firſt.</p>
               <p>They affirme<note n="c" place="margin">Immediata mortis Chriſti effectio, ac paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionis, illa eſt, non actualis pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catorum, ab his aut illis ablatio, non actualis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſio, non juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficatio, non actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alis horu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aut il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> redemptio: Armin. Antiperk, p. 76.</note> that the <hi>immediate, and proper effect, or end, of
the death and paſſion of Chriſt, is not an actuall oblation of ſinne
from men, not an actuall remiſſion of iniquities, iuſtification and
redemption, of any ſoule:</hi> that is, Chriſt his death, is not the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious
cauſe of the remiſſion of our ſins, of redemption, and
juſtification: the meritorious cauſe, I ſay, for of ſome of them,
as of juſtification, as it is terminated in us, we confeſſe there are
cauſes of other kindes, as faith is the inſtrument, and the holy
Spirit the efficient thereof. But for the ſole meritorious procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
cauſe, of theſe ſpirituall bleſſings, we alwaies took it to be
the righteouſneſſe, and death of Chriſt: beleeving plainely, that
the end why Chriſt died, and the fruit of his ſufferings, was <hi>our
reconciliation with God, redemption from our ſinnes, freedome from
the curſe, deliverance from the wrath of God, and power of hell:</hi>
though we be not actuall partakers of theſe things to the pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of our owne conſciences, without the intervening opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the holy Spirit, and faith by him wrought in us.</p>
               <p>But if this be not? Pray what is obtained by the death of
Chriſt? Why<note n="d" place="margin">Reconciliatio potentialis &amp; conditionata non actualis &amp; abſoluta, per mortem Chriſti impetratur: Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin. ad. Molin. cap 28. ſect. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>a potentiall, conditionate reconciliation, not actuall,
and abſolute,</hi> ſaith <hi>Corvinus:</hi> But yet this potentiall reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
being a new expreſſion, never intimated in the Scripture, and
ſcarce of it ſelfe intelligible, we want a further explanation of
their minde, to know what it is that directly they aſſigne to the
merits of Chriſt: wherefore, they tell us, that the fruit of his
death, <hi>was ſuch</hi>

                  <hi>There was by the effuſion of
Chriſts blood, a right obtained unto, and ſettled in God, of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling
the world, and of opening unto all, a gate of repentance, and
faith in Chriſt:</hi> But now whereas, the Scripture every where
affirmeth, that Chriſt died for our good, to obtaine bleſſings for
us, to purchaſe our peace, to acquire and merit for us, the good
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:155835:61"/>
things contained in the promiſe of the Covenant, this opinion
ſeemes to reſtraine the end, and fruit thereof, to the obtaining
of a power; and libertie unto God, of preſcribing us a condition
whereby we may be ſaved: but yet it may be, thus much at leaſt
Chriſt obtained of God in our behalfe, that he ſhould aſſigne faith
in him, to be this condition, and to beſtow it upon us alſo: <hi>No,
neither the one, nor the other,</hi>
                  <note n="g" place="margin">Potuiſſet De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, ſi ita ſapien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae ſuae viſum fuiſſet, operarios, Judaeos, vel alios etiam praeter fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deles eligere, quia potuit aliam ſalutis conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, quam fidem in Chriſtum exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere, Grevinch. ad Ameſ. p. 415.</note> 
                  <hi>after all this, had it ſo ſeemed good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his wiſedome, God might have choſen the Iewes, and others, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
the righteouſneſſe of the law, as well as beleevers, becauſe
he might have aſſigned, any other condition of ſalvation beſides
faith in Chriſt:</hi> ſaith <hi>Grevinchovius:</hi> Notwithſtanding then
the death of Chriſt for us, we might have beene held to the old
rule, <hi>Doe this and live:</hi> but if this be true, I cannot perceive
how it may be ſaid, that Chrid died to redeeme us from our ſins,
to ſave our ſoules, and bring us unto glory: neither perhaps, doe
they thinke this to be any great inconvenience, for the <hi>ſame
Authour</hi> affirmeth, <hi>that</hi>

                  <hi>Chriſt cannot be ſaid properly to die, to

                  <hi>That after Chriſt had obtained all that he did obtaine by his death,
the right remained wholly in God, to apply it, or not to apply it, as it
ſhould ſeeme good unto him: the application of grace and glory, to
any man, was not the end for which Chriſt obtained them, but to
get a right and power unto God, of beſtowing thoſe things on what
ſort of men he would:</hi> which argues no redemption of us from
our ſinnes, but a vindication of God from ſuch a condition, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he had not power to forgive them; not an obtaining of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for us, but of a libertie unto God of ſaving us, on ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
or other.</p>
               <p>But now, after God hath got this power by the death of
Chriſt, and out of his gracious good pleaſure, aſſigned faith to be
the meanes for us to attaine thoſe bleſſings, he hath procured
himſelfe a libertie to beſtow? Did Chriſt obtaine this faith for us,
of him? if it be a thing not in our own power? No:<note n="k" place="margin">Fides non eſt impetrata merito Chriſti, &amp;c. Cor. ad Mol. cap. 28. pag. 419.</note> 
                  <hi>Faith is

is no good thing, no ſpirituall bleſſing, into which, any man in

their glory to be called Chriſtians, did ever thus extenuate (their
friends the <hi>Socinians</hi> onely excepted) the dignitie of his merit
and ſatisfaction: take but a ſhort view of what benefit they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
to redound to us, by the effuſion of his precious blood, and
you may ſee what a peſtilent hereſie, theſe men have laboured
to bring into the Church: neither faith nor ſalvation, grace nor
glory, hath he purchaſed for us, not any ſpirituall bleſſing, that by
our intereſt in his death we can claime to be ours: it is not ſuch
a reconciliation with God, as that he thereupon, ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
againe to be called our God, it is not juſtification, nor
righteouſneſſe, nor actuall redemption from our ſinnes, it did not
make ſatisfaction for our iniquities, and deliver us from the
curſe:<note n="n" place="margin">Impetratio ſalutis pro om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus, eſt acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitio poſſibilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, ut nimirum Deus illaeſa ſua juſtitia hominem peccatorem poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit recipere in gratiam: Rem.

                  <hi>onely it was a meanes of obtaining ſuch a poſſibility of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
as that God without wronging of his iuſtice, might ſave us
if he would, one way or other:</hi> ſo that when Chriſt had done all

to us by the death of Chriſt, then to <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> we are
not much obliged to him for our ſalvation: Nay, he may be rather
ſaid to have redeemed God, then us, for he procured for him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
a power to redeeme us if he would; for us, onely by
vertue of that power, a poſſibilitie to be redeemed: which
leaves nothing of the nature of merit annexed to his death: for
that deſerveth that ſomething be done, not onely that it may be
done: the workman deſerveth that his wages be given him, and
not that it may be given him. And then what becomes of all the
comfort and conſolation that is propoſed to us in the death of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:155835:62"/>
Chriſt: but it is time to ſee how this ſtubble is burned and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
by the word of God: and that eſtabliſhed which they
thought to overthrow.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is cleare that Chriſt died to procure for us an actuall
reconciliation with God: and not only a power for us to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
unto him: for when we <hi>were enemies, we were reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to God, by the death of his ſonne:</hi> Rom. 5. 10. we enjoy an actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
reconciliation unto God by his death: he is content to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
our God, when we are enemies, without the intervening
of any condition on our part required: though the ſweetneſſe,
comfort, and knowledge of this reconciliation, doe not compaſſe,
our ſoules before we beleeve in him. Againe, we have remiſſion
of ſinnes by his blood, and juſtification from them, not a ſole vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication
into ſuch an eſtate, wherein, if it pleaſe God, and our
ſelves, our ſinnes are pardonable: for we are juſtified <hi>through the
redemption that is in Ieſus Chriſt, whom God hath ſet forth, to be a
propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteouſneſſe
for the remiſſion of ſinnes:</hi> Rom. 3. 24, 25. Yea, he obtained for
us by his death, righteouſneſſe and holineſſe. <hi>He gave himſelfe for
his Church, that he might ſanctifie and cleanſe it,</hi> Epheſ. 5. 26.
That <hi>he might preſent it unto himſelfe a glorious Church, without
ſpot, or wrinkle, that we ſhould be holy, and without blemiſh:</hi> verſ.
27. Where firſt, we have whom Chriſt died, or gave himſelfe for,
even his Church: ſecondly, what he obtained for it, holineſſe
and righteouſneſſe, a freedome from the ſpots, and blemiſhes of
ſinne, that is, the grace of juſtification and ſanctitie, <hi>he made him
to be ſinne for us, who knew no ſinne, that we might become the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
of God in him:</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 21. And laſtly he died, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
for us, <hi>an everlaſting inheritance:</hi> Heb. 9. 15. So that both
grace and glory, are beſtowed on them for whom he died, as the
immediate fruits of his death and paſſion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſee what the Scripture <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, expreſly aſſigneth, as
the proper end and immediate effect, (according to the purpoſe
of God, and his owne intention) of the effuſion of the blood of
Ieſus Chriſt, and you ſhall finde that he intended by it, to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the ſinnes of many, <hi>to make his ſoule an offering for ſinne, that
he might ſee his ſeed, that the counſell of God, might proſper in his
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:155835:62"/>
hand:</hi> Iſaiah 53. <hi>to be a ranſome for many,</hi> Matth. 20. 28. <hi>to beare
the ſins of many:</hi> Heb. 9. 28. <hi>he bare our ſins in his own body on the
tree, that we ſhould live unto righteouſneſſe,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 24. <hi>that we
might become the righteouſneſſe of God in him,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 21. thereby
<hi>reconciling us unto God,</hi> verſ. 19. he died, <hi>to reconcile us unto God,
in the body of his fleſh, through death, that we might be holy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable,</hi>
Coloſ. 1. 21, 22. <hi>to purge our ſins,</hi> Heb. 1. 3. <hi>to obtaine an
everlaſting redemption for us,</hi> Heb. 9. 12. ſo that if Chriſt by his
death obtained what he did intend: he hath purchaſed for us, not
only a poſſibilitie of ſalvation; but holineſſe, righteouſneſſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
with God, juſtification, freedome from the guilt, and
condemning power of ſin: everlaſting redemption, eternall life,
and glory in heaven.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I appeale unto the conſciences of all Chriſtians. Firſt,
whether they doe not ſuppoſe the very foundation of all their
conſolation, to be ſtricken at, when they ſhall finde thoſe places
of Scripture,<note n="p" place="margin">Heb. 7. 12. 15. 24. &amp; 9. 14. 28. Eſa. 53. 11. 1 Joh. 2. 2. &amp;c.</note> that affirme Chriſt to have died, <hi>to take away our
ſins, to reconcile us unto God, to put away, or aboliſh our tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
to waſh and regenerate us, perfectly to ſave us, and purchaſe
for us an everlaſting redemption, whereby he is become unto us,
righteouſneſſe, and redemption, and ſanctification, the Lord our
righteouſneſſe, and we become the righteouſneſſe of God in him:</hi> to
be ſo wreſted, as if he ſhould be ſaid only, to have done ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
which theſe things might happily follow.</p>
               <p>Secondly, whither they thinke it not a ready way, to impaire
their love, and to weaken their faith in Chriſt, when they ſhall be
taught, that Chriſt hath done no more for them, then for thoſe
that are damned in hell: that be their aſſurance never ſo great,
that Chriſt died for them: yet there is enough to be laid to their
charge to condemne them, that though God is ſaid to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
them unto himſelfe in Chriſt, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1. 19, 20. yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
he is as angry with them, as with any reprobate in the
world, that God loveth us not firſt, but ſo long as we continue in
a ſtate of enmitie againſt him, before our converſion, he continues
our enemy alſo: ſo that the firſt act of friendſhip or love, muſt be
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:155835:63"/>
performed on our part, notwithſtanding that the Scripture ſaith,
we were reconciled unto God being enemies, <hi>Romanes 5.
verſ.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Whither they have not hitherto ſuppoſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
bound to beleeve, that Chriſt died for their ſins and roſe
for their juſtification? do they not thinke it lawfull to pray, that
God would beſtow upon them, grace, and glory for Chriſts ſake?
and to beleeve that Ieſus Chriſt was ſuch a Mediatour of the new
Covenant, as procured for the perſons Covenanted withall, all
the good things comprehended in the promiſe of that Covenant.</p>
               <p>I will not further preſſe upon this prevarication againſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Religion, only I would deſire all the lovers of Ieſus Chriſt
ſeriouſly to conſider, whether theſe men, doe truly ayme at his
honour, and advancing the dignitie of his merit, and not rather, at
the crying up of their own indeavours, ſeeing the ſole cauſe of
their denying theſe glorious effects of the blood of Chriſt: is to
appropriate the praiſe of them unto themſelves, as we ſhall ſee in
the next Chapter.</p>
               <p>Theſe charges are never to be waved, by the vanitie of their
ſophiſticall diſtinctions, as of that of impetration and application,
which though it may be received, in an Orthodox meaning, yet
not in that ſenſe, or rather non-ſenſe, whereunto they abuſe it;
viz. <hi>As though Chriſt had obtained that for ſome, which ſhall never
be imparted unto them, that all the bleſſings procured by his death
are proper to none, but pendent in the aire for them that can or will
catch them:</hi> whereupon when we object,<note n="g" place="margin">Sic efficacia meriti Chriſti: tota penes nos ſtabit, qui voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem alioqui inefficacem effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacem, reddimus: ſane, fieri aliter non poteſt, Rem. Apol. p. 93.</note> 
                  <hi>that by this means
all the efficacie of the merit of Chriſt, is in our own power, they rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily

that God bleſſeth us, with all <hi>ſpirituall bleſſings in Chriſt,</hi>
Epheſ. 1. 3. and we will take leave to account faith a ſpirituall

ſince our regeneration is nothing but a purging of our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
from dead works, that we may ſerve the living God: which
being done by the blood of Chriſt, as the Apoſtle witneſſeth, <hi>Heb.</hi>

not ſuffer their Idoll to be accounted defective in any thing that

that nothing which God requireth of us, can be procured
for us by Chriſt: I would have two things noted. Firſt, that the
ſtrength of it conſiſts in this, that no gift of God beſtowed upon
us, can be a thing well pleaſing to him as being in us: for all his
precepts and commands ſignifie only, what is well pleaſing unto
him, that we ſhould be, or doe; and it is not the meriting of any
thing by Chriſt, but Gods beſtowing of it, as the effect thereof,
which hinders it from being a thing, requireable of us, as a part of
our dutie, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> I ſhall conſider hereafter: only now obſerve, that
there being nothing in us, by the way of habit or act from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of our faith, to the conſummation thereof from our new
birth, untill we become perfect men in Chriſt, by the finiſhing of
our courſe, that is not required of us in the Goſpel, all, and every
grace, whereof we are in this life partakers, are by this means de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
to be gifts of God. Secondly, conſider the extent of this
argument it ſelfe: nothing whoſe performance is our dutie, can
be merited for us by Chriſt; when the Apoſtle beſeecheth us, to
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:155835:65"/>
be reconciled unto God, I would know, whether it be not a part
of our duty to yeeld obedience to the Apoſtles exhortation: if not
his exhortation is frivolous and vaine, if ſo, then to be reconciled
unto God, is a part of our dutie, and yet the <hi>Arminians</hi> ſometime
ſeeme to confeſſe, that Chriſt hath obtained for us a reconciliation
with God: the like may be ſaid, in divers other particulars, ſo that
this argument, either proveth that we enjoy no fruit of the death
of Chriſt in this life: or (which is moſt true) it proveth nothing
at all: for neither the merit of Chriſt procuring, nor God beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any grace, in the habit, doth at all hinder, but that in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
thereof, it may be a duty of ours, inaſmuch as it is done in us,
and by us: notwithſtanding then this exception, which cannot
ſtand by it ſelfe alone without the helpe of ſome other, not as yet
diſcovered; we will continue our prayers, as we are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the name of Chriſt: that is, that God would beſtow upon
us thoſe things we ask for Chriſts ſake, and that by an immediate
collation, yea even then when we cry, with the poore penitent,
Lord helpe our unbeliefe, or with the Apoſtles, Lord increaſe our
faith.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the ſecond plea, on Gods behalfe, to prove him, the
Authour, and finiſher of all thoſe graces, whereof in this life we
are partakers, ariſeth, from what the Scripture affirmeth, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
his working theſe graces in us, and that powerfully, by the
effectuall operation of his holy Spirit: to which, the <hi>Arminians</hi>
oppoſe a ſeeming neceſſitie, that they muſt needs be our owne
acts, contradiſtinct from his gifts, becauſe they are in us, and
commanded by him: the head then of this contention betwixt
our God, and their Idol, about the living child of grace, is: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he can worke that in us, which he requireth of us: let
us heare them pleading their cauſe.</p>

doth not overthrow this prodigious error. I will content my
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:155835:67"/>
ſelfe with inſtancing in ſome few of them which are directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
unto it, even in termes,</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Deuter.</hi> 10. 16. The Lord commandeth the Iſraelites,
<hi>to circumciſe the fore-skin of their hearts, and to be no more ſtiffe
necked:</hi> ſo that the circumciſing of their hearts, was a part of
their obedience, it was their dutie ſo to do in obedience to Gods
commands: and yet in the 30. <hi>Chapter, verſ.</hi> 6. he affirmeth,
<hi>that he will circumciſe their hearts, that they might love the Lord
their God, with all their hearts:</hi> So that it ſeemes, the ſame thing,
in divers reſpects may be Gods act in us, and our dutie towards
him: and how the Lord will here eſcape the <hi>Arminian</hi> cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
that if his words be true, in the latter place, his command
in the former, is vaine, and fooliſh, <hi>ipſe viderit,</hi> let him plead his
cauſe, and avenge himſelfe, on thoſe, that riſe up againſt him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Ezek. 18. 31. Make you a new heart, and a new ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
for why will you die, O houſe of Iſrael?</hi> The making of a new
heart, and a new ſpirit, is here required under a promiſe of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of life, and a great threatning of eternall death: ſo that, ſo
to doe, muſt needs be a part of their dutie and obedience: and
yet <hi>Chapter 36. verſ.</hi> 36. He affirmeth that <hi>he will doe this very
thing, that here he requireth of them: a new heart alſo will I give
you, and a new ſpirit, will I put within you, and I will take away
the ſtony heart, out of your fleſh, and give you an heart of fleſh: and
I will cauſe you to walke in my ſtatutes, &amp;c.</hi> In how many places
alſo, are we commanded to feare the Lord, which when we doe,
I hope none will deny to be a performance of our dutie; and yet
<hi>Jerem.</hi> 32. 40. God promiſeth that he will put his feare in our
hearts, that we ſhall not depart from him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, thoſe two, againſt which they lay particular excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
faith, and repentance, are alſo expreſly attributed, to the free
donation of God: he granteth unto the <hi>Gentiles</hi> repentance unto
life: <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 18. and of faith directly, it is not of our ſelves, it
is the gift of God: <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 8. To which aſſertion of the holy
Spirit, I ſhall rather faſten my beliefe; then to the <hi>Arminians,</hi>
affirming that it is no gift of God, becauſe it is of our ſelves: and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:155835:67"/>
yet this hindereth not, but that it may be ſtiled, <hi>Our moſt holy
faith:</hi> Iude 20. Let them that will deny, that any thing can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
be ours, which God beſtoweth on us: the Prophet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
them not inconſiſtent, when he averred, <hi>that God work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
all our workes in us:</hi> Iſa. 26. 12. They are our workes, though
of his working: the Apoſtle laboured, though it was not he,
but the grace of God that was with him: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 10. He

<hi>Philip.</hi> 2. 13. and yet the performance of our dutie, may conſiſt,

have.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, 1 <hi>Cor. 4. Who made thee differ from another, or what
haſt thou, that thou haſt not received?</hi> Every thing that makes us
differ from others, is received from God: wherefore the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of all difference in ſpirituall things betweene the ſonnes
of <hi>Adam:</hi> being faith and repentance, they muſt alſo of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
be received from above. In briefe; Gods <hi>circumciſing of our

Covenant, that I will not turne away from them to doe them
good, but I will put my feare in their hearts, that they ſhall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part

now let all men judge, whether againſt ſo many, and cleere teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies

cauſe of Salvation, with their ſhutting
out of Chriſt, from being the onely one, and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
neceſſary meanes, to bring us unto heaven,
to make us happy: this is the laſt Pile they erect
upon their Babyloniſh foundation, which makes the Idol of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
ſelfe-ſufficiencie, every way perfect, and fit, to be ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed
unto: untill theſe proud builders, to get materials for
their owne Temple, laid the Axe to the root of Chriſtianitie, we
tooke it for grounded, that there is no ſalvation in any other,
becauſe there is none other name under heaven, given unto men,
whereby we muſt be ſaved: <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 12. Neither yet ſhall their
nefarious attempts, frighten us from our Creed, nor make us
be wanting to the defence of our Saviours honour, but I ſhall be
very briefe in the conſideration of this Heterodoxie, nothing
doubting, but that to have repeated it, is fully to have confuted
it, in the judgement of all pious Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, they grant ſalvation, to the ancient Patriarches and
Iewes, before the coming of Chriſt, without any knowledge
of, or faith in him at all: Nay, they deny, that any ſuch faith in
Chriſt, was ever preſcribed unto them, or required of them:
<note n="a" place="margin">Certum eſt lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum nullum eſſe, unde appareat, ſidem iſtam, ſub Vet. Teſt prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptam fuiſſe, aut viguiſſe, Rem. Apol. cap. 7. fol. 91.</note> 
                  <hi>It is certaine that there is no place in the Old Teſtament, from
whence it may appeare, that faith in Chriſt (as a Redeemer) was
ever enioyned, or found in any of them:</hi> ſay they joyntly, in their
Apologie: the truth of which aſſertion, we ſhall ſee hereafter:
onely they grant a generall faith, involved under types, and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes,
and looking on the promiſe, as it lay hid in the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and providence of God, which indirectly might be called
a faith in Chriſt: from which kinde of faith, I ſee no reaſon, why
thouſands of heathen Infidels ſhould be excluded: agreeable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:155835:69"/>
theſe aſſertions, are the Dictates, of their Patriarch <hi>Arminius:</hi>

he anſwereth, <hi>he reioyced to ſee the birth of</hi> Iſaac, <hi>who was a type of
mee,</hi> a goodly gloſſe corrupting the text.</p>
               <p>Secondly, what they teach of the Iews, that alſo, they grant
concerning the Gentiles: living before the incarnation of Chriſt:
they alſo might attaine ſalvation, and be juſtified without his
knowledge: for<note n="c" place="margin">Gentes ſub ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teri teſtamento viventes licet ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis iſta ratione qua Iudaeis non fuit revelatum: non tamen inde continuo ex fae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere abſolute ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſae ſunt, nec à ſalute praeciſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſi judicari debent quia ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quo ſaltem modo vocantur. Corvi. defenſ. Armin. ad Tilen. fol. 107.</note> although ſaith <hi>Corvinus, the Covenant was not
revealed unto them by the ſame means, that it was unto the Iews:
yet they are not to be ſuppoſed, to be excluded from the Covenant (of
grace) nor to be excluded from ſalvation: for ſome way or other,
they were called.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, they are come at length, to that perfection, in ſetting
out this ſtaine of Chriſtianitie, that <hi>Bertius</hi> on good conſideration,
denied this propoſition, <hi>that no man can be ſaved, that is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted
into Chriſt, by a true faith: and</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Nego hanc pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitionem: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem poſſe ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vari, quam qui Ieſu Chriſto, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veram fidem ſit inſitus, Bert. ad ſibrand. fol. 133.</note> 
                  <hi>Venator</hi> to this queſtion,
<hi>Whether the only means of ſalvation, be the life, paſſion, death, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,
and aſcenſion of Ieſus Chriſt, anſwereth, no?</hi> thus they
lay men in <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome, who never beleeved in the ſonne
of <hi>Abraham:</hi> make them overcome the ſerpent, who never
heard of the ſeed of the woman, bring goats into heaven, who
never were of the flock of Chriſt, never entred by him the doore:
make men pleaſe God without faith, and obtaine the remiſſion of
ſins,<note n="e" place="margin">Ad hanc quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionem an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca via ſalutis, ſit vita paſſio mors reſurrectio &amp; aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſio Ieſu Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti? reſpondeo, non.

ſaved without a Saviour, redeemed without a redeemer: to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the ſons of God, and never know their elder brother: which
prodigious errour, might yet be pardoned, and aſcribed to humane
imbecillitie, had it caſually ſlipt from their pens as<note n="f" place="margin">Zuing. profeſ. fid. ad reg. Gal.</note> it did from
ſome others: but ſeeing it hath foundation, in all the grounds of
their new doctrine, and is maintained by them, on mature deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration,
<note n="g" place="margin">Artic. of the Church of Eng. art. 18.</note> it muſt be looked on by all Chriſtians, as an hereſie to
be deteſted and accurſed. For, firſt deny the contagion and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:155835:70"/>
of originall ſinne: then make the Covenant of grace to be
univerſall, and comprehend all and every one of the poſteritie of
<hi>Adam,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Nihil magis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnat fidei, qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſine fide ſalvum eſſe poſſe quem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piam hominum. Acoſt. de indo, Salu. Proc.</note> thirdly, grant a power in our ſelves to come unto God,
by any ſuch means as he will appoint and affirme, that he doth
aſſigne ſome means unto all, and it will naturally follow, that the
knowledge of Chriſt, is not abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation: and
ſo down fals the preheminence of Chriſtianitie, its heaven reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
crown, muſt be laid levell with the ſervices of dung-hill gods.</p>
               <p>It is true indeed, ſome of the ancient Fathers, before the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of the <hi>Pelagian</hi> hereſie; who had ſo put on Chriſt, as <hi>Lipſius</hi>
ſpeaks, that they had not fully put of <hi>Plato,</hi> have unadviſedly dropt
ſome ſpeeches, ſeeming to grant, that divers men before the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation,
living <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, according to the dictates of right rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
might be ſaved without faith in Chriſt: as is well ſhewed
by learned <hi>Cauſabon,</hi> in his firſt excercitation on <hi>Baronius:</hi> but let
this be accounted part of that ſtubble, which ſhall burne at the laſt
day, wherewith the writings of all men, not divinely inſpired
may be ſtained: it hath alſo ſince, (as what hath not) been drawn
into diſpute among the wrangling Schoolemen: and yet, which
is rarely ſeene, their verdict in this particular, almoſt unanimouſly
paſſeth for the truth:<note n="h" place="margin">Aquin. 2. 2 ae. q. 2. a. 7. c. Chriſtus naſcitur ex virgine, &amp; ego credo in eum, ô Sol, ſub Irenae &amp; Conſtantini tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poribus iterum me videbis.</note> 
                  <hi>Aquinas</hi> tels us a ſtory of the corps of a
heathen, that ſhould be taken up in the time of the Empreſſe
<hi>Irene,</hi> and her ſonne <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> with a golden plate on his breſt,
wherein was this inſcription: <hi>Chriſt is borne of a virgin, and I
beleeve in him oh Sun, thou ſhalt ſee me againe, in the dayes of</hi> Irene
<hi>and</hi> Conſtantine: but the queſtion is not, whether a Gentile be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving
in Chriſt may be ſaved? or whether God did not reveale
himſelfe, and his Sonne, extraordinarily to ſome of them: for
ſhall we ſtraighten the breſt, and ſhorten the arme of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
as though he might not doe what he will with his own.
But whether a man by the conduct of nature, without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Chriſt, may come to heaven:<note n="i" place="margin">Dum multum ſudant nonnulli, quomodo Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem faciant Chriſtianum, ſe probant eſſe eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicos, Bern. Epiſt.</note> the aſſertion whereof, we
condemne as a wicked <hi>Pelagian Socinian</hi> hereſie: and thinke, that
it was well ſaid of <hi>Bernard; that many labouring to make</hi> Plato
<hi>a Chriſtian, doe prove themſelves to be Heathens:</hi> and if we looke
upon the ſeverall branches of this <hi>Arminian</hi> novell doctrine, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuating
the precious worth and neceſſitie of faith in Chriſt:
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:155835:70"/>
we ſhall finde them, hewed off by the two edged ſword of
Gods word.</p>
               <p>Firſt, for their denying, the Patriarchs and Iews, to have had
faith, <hi>in Chriſtum exhibendum &amp; moriturum,</hi> as we in him, <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitum &amp; mortuum,</hi> it is diſproved by all Evangelicall promiſes,
made from the beginning of the world, to the birth of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
as that, <hi>Gen. 3. 15. The ſeed of the woman ſhall breake the
Serpents head,</hi> and Chap. 12. 3. Chap. 49. 10. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 7, 8. and 110.
with innumerable other, concerning his life, office, and redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of his people: for ſurely they were obliged to beleeve the
promiſes of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, thoſe many cleare expreſſions of his death, paſſion,
and ſuffering for us: as <hi>Gen. 3. 15. Iſaiah</hi> 53. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, &amp;c.
<hi>Chap. 63. 2, 3. Dan.</hi> 9. 26. but what need we reckon any more:
our Saviour taught his Diſciples, that all the Prophets from <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>
ſpake concerning him, and that the ſole reaſon, why they did
not ſo readily embrace the faith of his paſſion, and reſurrection,
was, becauſe they <hi>beleeved not the Prophets,</hi> Luk. 24. 25, 26. ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
plainly, that the Prophets required faith in his death and
paſſion.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, by the explicite faith of many Iews, as of old <hi>Simeon,
Luke</hi> 3. 34. of the Samaritan woman, who looked for a Meſſias,
not as an earthly King, but as one that ſhould tell them all things:
redeeme them from ſinne, and tell them all ſuch things, as Chriſt
was then diſcourſing of, concerning the worſhip of God, <hi>Ioh. 4.
verſ.</hi> 25.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, by the expreſſe teſtimony of Chriſt himſelf: <hi>Abraham</hi>
ſaith he, <hi>reioyced to ſee my day, and he ſaw it and was glad:</hi> Ioh. 8.
56. his day, his houre, in the Scripture principally denote his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion:
and that which he ſaw ſurely he beleeved, or elſe the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the faithfull, was more diffident then <hi>Thomas</hi> the moſt
incredulous, of his children.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly, By theſe following and the like places of Scripture:</hi>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:155835:71"/>
Chriſt is a Lambe ſlaine from the foundation of the world, <hi>Revel.
13. 8. ſlaine in promiſes, ſlaine in Gods eſtimation and the faith of
beleever,</hi> he is the ſame yeſterday to day and for ever, <hi>Heb. 13. 8.
under the law and the Goſpel:</hi> There is none other name under
heaven given unto men, whereby they muſt be ſaved: <hi>Acts 4. 12.
never any then, without the knowledge of a Redeemer, partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
of his paſſion, communication of his merits, did ever come
to the ſight of God: no man ever came to the Father but by him:
hence S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>.</hi> Paul <hi>tels the</hi> Epheſians, <hi>that they were</hi> without Chriſt,
becauſe they were aliens from the Common-wealth of Iſrael: <hi>Epheſ.
2. 12. intimating that Gods Covenant with the Iews, included
Chriſt Ieſus and his righteouſneſſe, no leſſe then it doth now
with us: on theſe grounds holy</hi> Ignatius,<note n="k" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>. Epiſt. ad Phil.</note> all the Saints were ſaved by Chriſt: hoping in him:
and waiting on him, they obtained ſalvation by him: <hi>So</hi>
                  <note n="m" place="margin">Non alia fide quemquam ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum ſive ante legem, ſive legis tempore, juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum eſſe cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendum eſt, qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hac eadem qua Dominus Ieſus, &amp;c. Proſp. ad ob. 8. Gallorum.</note> Proſper
<hi>alſo,</hi> We muſt beleeve that never any man was iuſtified, by any other
faith, either before the Law, or under the Law, then by faith in
Chriſt, coming to ſave that which was loſt. <hi>Whence</hi> Euſebius
<hi>contendeth,</hi> that all the old Patriarchs might properly be called
Chriſtians, <hi>they all eate of the ſame ſpirituall meat, and all dranke
of the ſame ſpirituall drinke, even of the rocke that followed
them, which rocke was Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, if the ancient people of God, notwithſtanding, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
other eſpeciall revelations of his will: and heavenly inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
obtained not ſalvation, without faith in Chriſt, much leſſe
may we grant this happineſſe without him, to them, who were
deprived of thoſe other helps alſo:<note n="n" place="margin">Omnes ergo illos qui ab Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham ſurſum ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus ad primum hominem, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rationis ordine conſcribuntur, etſi non nomine, rebus tamen, &amp; religione Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianos fuiſſe, ſi quis dicat, non mihi videtur er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare. Euſ. Hiſtor. eccleſ. lib. 1. cap. 1.</note> ſo that though we confeſſe
the poore naturall indeavours of the heathen, not to have wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
their reward: either poſitive in this life, by outward proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
and inward calmneſſe of minde, in that, they were not all
perplexed, and agitated with furies, like <hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>Caligula,</hi> or
negative, in the life to come, by a diminution of the degrees of
their torments: they ſhall not be beaten with ſo many ſtripes:
yet we abſolutely deny, that there is any ſaving mercy of God,
towards them revealed in the Scripture, which ſhould give us
the leaſt intimation of their attaining everlaſting happineſſe: for
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:155835:71"/>
not to conſider the corruption and univerſall diſability of <hi>nature,
to doe any thing that is good, (without Chriſt we can doe nothing)
Ioh.</hi> 15. 5. nor yet the ſinfulneſſe of their beſt works, and actions,
the ſacrifices <hi>of the wicked being an abomination unto the Lord,</hi>
Prov. 15. 8. <hi>Evill trees cannot bring forth good fruit, men doe not
gather grapes of thornes, nor figs of thiſtles,</hi> Matth. 7. 16. the word
of God is plaine, <hi>that without faith, it is impoſſible to pleaſe God,</hi>
Heb. 11. 6. that he, <hi>who beleeveth not, is condemned,</hi> Mark. 16. 16.
that no nation, or perſon, can be bleſſed, but in the ſeed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
Gen. 12. and the <hi>bleſſing of</hi> Abraham, <hi>comes upon the Gentiles
only by Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 3. 14. <hi>He is the way, and the truth, and the
life,</hi> Ioh. 14. 6. none comes to the Father but by him, <hi>he is the
doore,</hi> by which thoſe that doe not enter, are without, <hi>with Dogs,
and Idolaters,</hi> Revel. 22. <hi>So that other foundation, (of bleſſedneſſe)
can none lay, but what is already laid, even Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Corinth.
3. 12. in briefe, doe but compare thoſe two places of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
one <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 30. where he ſheweth, that none are glorified, but
thoſe that are called: and <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. 14, 15. where he declares,
that all calling, is inſtrumentally by the preaching of the Word
and Goſpel: and it will evidently appeare, that no ſalvation can
be granted unto them, on whom the Lord hath ſo farre powred
out his indignation, as to deprive them of the knowledge of the
ſole means thereof Chriſt Ieſus. And to thoſe that are otherwiſe
minded, I give only this neceſſary caution, let them take heed,
leſt whileſt they indeavour to invent new wayes to heaven for
others, by ſo doing, they looſe not the true way themſelves.</p>

of moſt of the Chriſtian by ſtanders: yet by his cunning

be rooted out.</p>
               <p>Now after the deceaſe of his <hi>Pelagian</hi> worſhippers, ſome of
the corrupter Schoolemen, ſeeing of him thus from his birth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
without ſhelter to wind and weather, to all aſſaults out of
meere charity, and ſelf-love, built him a temple, and adorned it
with naturall lights, merits, uncontrouled independent operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
with many other gay attendances. But in the beginning of
the Reformation, that fatall time for Idolatry and ſuperſtition,
together with Abbies, and Monaſteries, the zeal and learning of
our forefathers, with the helpe of Gods word, demoliſhed this
temple, and brake this building down to the ground: in the rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſh
whereof, we well hoped the Idoll himſelfe had been ſo
deeply buried, as that his head ſhould never more have been
exalted, to the trouble of the Church of God: untill not long
ſince, ſome curious wits, whoſe weake ſtomacks were clogged
with Manna, and loathed the ſincere milk of the Word, raking all
dunghils for novelties, lighted unhappily upon this Idoll: and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently,
with no leſſe joy then did the Mathematician at the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of a new Geometricall proportion, exclaime we have found
it, we have found it: and without more adoe, up they erected a
ſhrine, and untill this day continue offering of praiſe and thanks
for all the good they doe, to this worke of their own hands.</p>
               <p>And that the Idol may be free from ruine, to which in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
they have found by experience that he is ſubject; they have
matcht him to contingency, a new goddeſſe of their own creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Who having proved, very fruitfull in monſtrous births, upon
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:155835:73"/>
their conjunctions; they nothing doubt, they ſhall ever want one
to ſet on the throne, and make preſident of all humane actions:
ſo that after he hath with various ſucceſſe, at leaſt twelve hundred
yeeres, contended with the providence and grace of God: he,
boaſteth now, as if he had obtained a totall victory. But yet all his
prevailing, is to be attributed to the diligence, and varniſh of his
new abetters, with (to our ſhame be it ſpoken) the negligence
of his adverſaries: in him, and his cauſe, there is no more reall
worth then was, when by the ancient Fathers he was exploded,
and curſed out of the Church: ſo that they, who can attaine
through the many winding Labyrinths, of curious diſtinctions, to
looke upon the thing it ſelfe, ſhall finde that they have beene, like
<hi>Aegyptian</hi> Novices, brought through many ſtately Frontiſpieces
and goodly Fabricks, with much ſhew of zeale and devotion, to
the image of an ugly Ape.</p>
               <p>Yet here obſerve, that we doe not abſolutely oppoſe Free-will,
as if it were <hi>nomen inane,</hi> a meer figment when there is no
ſuch thing in the world: but onely in that ſenſe the <hi>Pelagians</hi>
and <hi>Arminians</hi> doe aſſert it. About words we will not contend,
we grant man in the ſubſtance of all his actions, as much power,
libertie and freedome, as a meere created nature is capable of:
We grant him to be free in his choyce, from all outward coacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or inward naturall neceſſitie, to worke according to electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and deliberation, ſpontaneouſly embracing what ſeemeth
good unto him: Now call this power, Free-will, or what you
pleaſe, ſo you make it not ſupreme, independent, and bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
we are not at all troubled. The impoſition of names, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
upon the diſcretion of their inventers. Againe, even in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
things, we deny that our wils are at all debarred, or depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of their proper libertie: but here we ſay indeed, that we are
not properly free, untill the Sonne make us free: no great uſe of
freedome, in that, wherein we can doe nothing at all: we doe
not claime ſuch a libertie, as ſhould make us deſpiſe the grace of
God,<note n="m" place="margin">Homo non libertate grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, ſed gratia libertatem, aſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

now, not as it was at firſt, by God created, but as it is now,
by ſinne corrupted: yet being conſidered in that eſtate al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,

now ſtandeth, according to my formerly propoſed method, I
ſhall ſhew, firſt, what-inbred native vertue they aſcribe unto it,
and with how abſolute a dominion, and ſovereignty, over all our

operations, a plenarie indifferencie, of doing what we will, this,
or that, as being neither determined to the one, nor inclined to
the other, by any over-ruling influence from heaven: ſo, that the

by any ſuperiour Agents: Now the firſt of theſe, we deny
unto our wils, becauſe they are created, and the ſecond, becauſe
they are corrupted: their creation hinders them from doing any
thing of themſelves, without the aſſiſtance of Gods providence,
and their corruption, of doing any thing that is good without his
grace: a ſelfe-ſufficiencie for operation, without the effectuall
motion of Almightie God, the firſt cauſe of all things, we can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
neither to men, nor Angels, unleſſe we intend, to make
them Gods: and a power of doing good, equall unto that they
have of doing evill, we muſt not grant to man by nature, unleſſe
we will deny the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> and fancie our ſelves ſtill in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice:
but let us conſider theſe things apart.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I ſhall not ſtand to decipher the nature of humane liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
which perhaps would require a larger diſcourſe, then my
propoſed Method will beare: it may ſuffice, that according to
my former intimation, we grant as large a freedome and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
to our wils, over their owne acts, as a creature ſubject
to the ſupreame rule of Gods providence, is capable of: en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
we are, with ſuch a libertie of will, as is free from all
outward compulſion, and inward neceſſitie, having an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
facultie of applying it ſelfe, unto that which ſeemes good
unto it: in which its free choice notwithſtanding, it is ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient
to the decree of God, as I ſhewed before, Chapter 4. Moſt
free it is in all its acts, both in regard of the object it chooſeth, and
in regard of that vitall power, and facultie, whereby it worketh,
infallibly complying with Gods providence, and working by
vertue of the motion thereof: but ſurely to aſſert ſuch a ſupreme
independency, and every way unbounded indifferencie, as the
<hi>Arminians</hi> claime, whereby all other things requiſite being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſed,
it ſhould remaine abſolutely in our owne power, to
will, or not to will, to doe any thing, or not to doe it, is plainly
to deny that our wils are ſubject to the rule of the moſt High.
It is granted, that in ſuch a chymaericall fancied conſideration of
free-will, wherein it is looked upon as having no relation
to any act of Gods, but onely its creation, abſtracting from his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,
it may be ſaid: to have ſuch a libertie in regard of the object:
but the truth is, this divided ſenſe, is plaine nonſenſe, a meere
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:155835:76"/>
fiction of ſuch an eſtate, wherein it never was, nor ever can be,
ſo long as men will confeſſe any Deitie but themſelves, to whoſe
determinations they muſt be ſubject: untill then more ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
termes may be invented for this free power in our nature,
which the Scripture never once vouchſafed to name, I ſhall be
content to call it with <hi>Proſper,</hi>
                  <note n="u" place="margin">Lib. Arbit. eſt rei ſibi placitae Spontaneus ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitus: Proſp. ad Collat. cap. 18. p. 379.</note> a <hi>Spontaneous</hi> appetite of what
ſeemeth good unto it; free from all compulſion, but ſubſervient to
the providence of God: and againſt its exaltation, to this height
of independencie, I oppoſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, every thing that is independent of any elſe in operation,
is purely active, and ſo conſequently a God: for nothing but a
divine will can be a pure act, poſſeſſing ſuch a libertie by vertue
of its owne eſſence: every created will, muſt have a libertie by
participation, which includeth ſuch an imperfect potentiality, as
cannot be brought into act, without ſome praemotion (as I may
ſo ſay) of a Superiour Agent: neither doth this motion being
extrinſecall, at all prejudice the true libertie of the will, which
requireth indeed, that the internall principle of operation be
active and free, but not, that, that principle be not moved to
that operation, by an outward Superiour Agent: nothing in this
ſenſe, can have an independent principle of operation, which hath
not an independent being: it is no more neceſſary, to the nature
of a free cauſe, from whence a free action muſt proceed, that it be
the firſt beginning of it; then it is neceſſarie to the nature of a
cauſe, that it be the firſt cauſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if the free acts of our wils are ſo ſubſervient, to the
providence of God, as that he uſeth them to what end he will,
and by them effecteth many of his purpoſes, then they cannot of
themſelves, be ſo abſolutely independent as to have in their
owne power, every neceſſarie circumſtance, and condition,
that thoy may uſe, or not uſe at their pleaſure: Now the former
is proved, by all thoſe reaſons, and Texts of Scripture, I before
produced, to ſhew that the providence of God overruleth
the actions and determineth the wils of men, freely to doe, that
which he hath appointed: and truely were it otherwiſe, Gods
dominion over the moſt things that are in the world, were quite
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:155835:77"/>
excluded, he had not power to determine, that any one thing,
ſhould ever come to paſſe, which hath any reference to the wils
of men.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, all the acts of the will, being poſitive entities, were it
not previouſly moved, by God himſelfe, in whom we live,
move, and have our being, muſt needs have their eſſence and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence,
ſolely from the will it ſelfe: which is thereby made
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a firſt and ſupreame cauſe, indued with an underived be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
and ſo much to that particular.</p>
               <p>Let us now in the ſecond place, looke upon the power of our
free-will, in doing that which is morally good: where we ſhall
finde not onely an eſſentiall imperfection, in as much as it is crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but alſo, a contracted defect, in as much as it is corrupted:
the abilitie which the <hi>Arminians</hi> aſcribe unto it, in this kinke, of
doing that which is morally and ſpiritually good, is as large as
themſelves will confeſſe to be competent unto it, in the ſtate of
innocencie: even a power of beleeving, and a power of reſiſting
the Goſpel: of obeying, and not obeying: of turning, or of not
being converted.</p>
               <p>The Scripture, as I obſerved before, hath no ſuch terme at all,
nor nothing equivalent unto it: but the expreſſions it uſeth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
our nature and all the faculties thereof, in this ſtate of
ſinne and unregeneration, ſeeme to imply the quite contrary:
<hi>as that we are in bondage:</hi> Heb. 2. 15. <hi>dead in ſinne:</hi> Epheſ. 2. 3.
<hi>and ſo free from righteouſneſſe,</hi> Rom. 6. <hi>ſervants of ſinne:</hi> ver. 16.
<hi>under the reigne and dominion thereof:</hi> verſ. 12. all <hi>our members
being inſtruments of unrighteouſneſſe:</hi> verſ. 13. Not free indeed,
untill the Sonne make us free, ſo that this Idol of free-will, in
reſpect of ſpirituall things, is not one whit better, then the other
Idols of the heathen: <hi>Though it looke like ſilver and gold, it is the
worke of mens hands, it hath a mouth, but it ſpeakes not, it hath
eyes but it ſees not, it hath eares but it heares not, a noſe but it ſmels
not, it hath hands, but it handleth not, feet but it walkes not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſpeaketh it through the throat, all they that made it, are like
unto it, and ſo is every one, that truſteth in it: O Iſrael truſt thou
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:155835:77"/>
in the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> That it is the worke of mens hands, or a humane
invention, I ſhewed before: for the reſt: it hath a mouth, unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the myſteries of godlineſſe, <hi>full onely of curſing
and bitterneſſe:</hi> Rom. 3. 14. <hi>ſpeaking great ſwelling words:</hi> Iude
verſ. 16. <hi>great things and blaſphemies:</hi> Revel. 13. 5. a mouth
<hi>cauſing the fleſh to ſinne:</hi> Eccleſ. 6. 5. his eyes are blinde, <hi>not able
to perceive thoſe things that are of God, nor to know thoſe things
that are ſpiritually diſcerned,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 14. eyes before which there
is no feare of God: <hi>Rom. 3. 18. his underſtanding is darkened, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of the blindneſſe of his heart,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 18. <hi>wiſe to doe evill,
but to doe good, he hath no knowledge,</hi> Ierem. 4. 22. So that
without farther light, all the world, is but a <hi>meere darkeneſſe:
Iohn</hi> 1. 5. he hath eares, but they are like the eares of the deafe
Adder, to the word of God, <hi>refuſing to heare the voyce of the
Charmer, charme he never ſo wiſely,</hi> Pſal. 54. 8. beeing dead,
when this voyce firſt cals it: <hi>Iohn 5. 25. eares ſtopped, that they
ſhould not heare,</hi> Zach. 8. 11. <hi>heavie eares, that cannot heare,</hi> Iſa. 6.
10. <hi>a noſe, to which the Goſpel is the ſavour of death, unto death:</hi>
2 Cor. 2. 16. <hi>hands full of blood,</hi> Iſa. 1. 15. and <hi>fingers defiled with
iniquitie,</hi> Chap. 59. 3. feet indeed, but like <hi>Mephiboſheth,</hi> lame
in both by a fall, ſo that he cannot at all walke in the path of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
<hi>but ſwift to ſhed blood, deſtruction and miſerie are in their
waies, and the way of peace they have not knowne,</hi> Rom. 3. 15, 16,
17. Theſe and divers other ſuch endowments, and excellent
qualifications, doth the Scripture attribute to this Idol, which it
cals <hi>the old man,</hi> as I ſhall more fully diſcover in the next Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
and is not this a goodly Reed whereon to rely, in the paths
of godlineſſe? a powerfull Deitie, whereunto we may repaire,
for a power to become the ſonnes of God? and attaining eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
happineſſe? the abilities of Free-will in particular, I ſhall
conſider hereafter, now onely, I will by one or two reaſons
ſhew, that it cannot be the ſole and proper cauſe, of any truely
good, and ſpirituall act well pleaſing unto God.</p>
               <p>Firſt, all ſpirituall acts well pleaſing unto God, as faith, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
obedience, are ſupernaturall: fleſh and blood revealeth not
theſe things: <hi>not of blood nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will
of man: but of the will of God:</hi> Iohn 1. 13. <hi>That which is borne
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:155835:78"/>
of the fleſh, is fleſh; and that which is borne of the ſpirit, is ſpirit:
Iohn</hi> 3. 6. Now to the performance of any ſupernaturall act, it is
required, that the productive power thereof be alſo ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
for nothing hath an activitie in cauſing above its own ſphere,
<hi>nec imbelles generant feroces aquilas columbae:</hi> but our free-will is a
meerly naturall faculty, betwixt which, and thoſe ſpirituall ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall
acts, there is no proportion, unleſſe it be advanced above
its owne or be by inherent habituall grace. Divine Theologicall
vertues, differing even in the ſubſtance of the act from thoſe
morall performances about the ſame things, to which the
ſtrength of nature may reach, (for the difference of acts, ariſeth
from their formall objects, which to both theſe are divers) muſt
have another principle and cauſe, above all the power of nature:
in civill things, and actions morally good, in as much as they are
ſubject to a naturall perception, and doe not exceed the ſtrength
of our owne wils, this facultie of Free-will may take place, but
yet, not without theſe following limitations. Firſt, that it alwaies
requireth the generall concurſe of God, whereby the whole
<hi>ſuppoſitum</hi> in which Free-will hath its ſubſiſtence, may be ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
<hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 29. 30. Secondly, that we doe all theſe things
imperfectly and with much infirmitie, every degree alſo of
excellency, in theſe things muſt be counted a ſpeciall gift of God:
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. 12. Thirdly, that our wils are determined by the will of
God, to all their acts and motions in particular: but to doe that
which is ſpiritually good, we have no knowledge, no power.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that concerning which, I gave one ſpeciall inſtance,
in whoſe production the <hi>Arminians</hi> attribute much to <hi>Free-will,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">An ulla actio S.

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, to the Scripture teaching that <hi>it is the worke of God
that we do beleeve:</hi> Ioh. 6. 29. <hi>It is not of our ſelves, it is the gift of
God:</hi> Epheſ. 2. 8. <hi>To ſome it is given to know the myſteries of the
kingdome of heaven:</hi> Matth, 13. 11. And what is peculiarly given
to ſome, cannot be in the power of every one: <hi>To you it is given
on the behalfe of Chriſt to beleeve on him,</hi> Phil. 1. 29. Faith is our
acceſſe or coming unto Chriſt, which none can do, unleſſe <hi>the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
draw him,</hi> Ioh. 6. 44. and he ſo draweth, or <hi>hath mercy, on
whom he will have mercy,</hi> Rom. 9. 19. and although <hi>Epiſcopius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
any immediate action of the holy Spirit, for the ingenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of faith, yet Saint <hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth, that there is no leſſe effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall
power required to it: then that which raiſed Chriſt from
the dead, which ſure was an action of the Almightie Godhead.
<hi>That we may know,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>what is the exceeding greatneſſe of his
power to usward, who beleeve according to the working of his
mightie power, which he wrought in Chriſt, when he raiſed him
from the dead,</hi> Epheſ. 1. 19, 20. So that let the <hi>Arminians</hi> ſay
what they pleaſe, recalling that I write to Chriſtians, I will ſpare
my labour of further proving, that faith is the free gift of God:
and their oppoſition to the truth of the Scripture in this particular,

an irrefragable truth, if faith be not a gift received from above:
for on that ground only the Apoſtle propoſeth theſe queſtions,
who made thee differ from another? or what haſt thou that thou
haſt not received? and if thou haſt received, why boaſteth thou
as if thou haſt not received? the ſole cauſe why he denies any one
by his own power to make himſelf differ from another, is, becauſe
that wherein the difference conſiſteth, is, received, being freely
beſtowed upon him: deny this, and I confeſſe the other will fall
of it ſelfe. But untill their authoritie, be equall with the Apoſtles,

w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> if it be not an expreſſion, not to be paralelled in the writings
of any Chriſtian, I am ſomething miſtaken: the ſumme of their
doctrine then in this particular concerning the power of Free-will,
in the ſtate of ſin, and unregeneration, is, <hi>That every man
having a native inbred power, of beleeving in Chriſt, upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
of the Goſpel, hath alſo an abilitie of doing ſo much good, as
ſhall procure of God, that the Goſpel be preached unto him, to which,
without any internall aſſiſtance of grace, he can give aſſent and yeeld
obedience: the preparatory acts of his own will, alwayes proceeding
ſo farre, as to make him excell others, who do not performe them, and
are therefore excluded from further grace.</hi> Which is more groſſe
<hi>Pelagianiſme</hi> then <hi>Pelagius</hi> himſelfe would ever juſtifie: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
we reject all the former poſitions, as ſo many monſters in
Chriſtian Religion, in whoſe roome we aſſert theſe that follow.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That we being by nature dead in treſpaſſes and ſinnes,
have no power to prepare our ſelves, for the receiving of Gods
grace: nor in the leaſt meaſure to beleeve, and turne our ſelves
unto him. Not that we deny, that there are any conditions, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>required
in us for our converſion, diſpoſitions preparing us in
ſome meaſure for our new birth or regeneration, but we affirme
that all theſe alſo, are the effects of the grace of God, relating to
that alone as their proper cauſe, for of our ſelves, <hi>Without him we
can do nothing,</hi> Ioh. 15. 15. <hi>We are not able of our ſelves to thinke
any thing as of our ſelves,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 5. much leſſe doe that which
is good, in reſpect of that, every one of our mouthes muſt be
ſtopped, <hi>for we have all ſinned and come ſhort of the glory of God,</hi>
Rom. 5. 19. 23. <hi>We are by nature the children of wrath, dead in
treſpaſſes and ſins,</hi> Epheſ. 2. 1. Rom. 8. 9. our new birth is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
from death, wrought by the greatneſſe of Gods power:
and what abilitie I pray hath a dead man, to prepare himſelfe for
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:155835:80"/>
for his reſurrection? can he collect his ſcattered duſt, or renew
his periſhed ſenſes? <hi>If the Leopard can change his ſpots, and the
Aethiopian his skin, then can we doe good who (by nature) are
taught to doe evill,</hi> Ierem. 13. 23. we are all ungodly, <hi>and without
ſtrength conſidered when Chriſt died for us,</hi> Rom. 5. 6. wiſe to do
evill, but to doe good, we have no ſtrength, no knowledge. Yea,
all the faculties of our ſoules, by reaſon of that ſpirituall death
under which we are detained by the corruption of nature, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
uſeleſſe in reſpect of any power, for the doing of that
which is truly good; our underſtandings are blind or darkened,
<hi>being alienated from the life of God, through the ignorance that is in
us, becauſe of the blindneſſe of our hearts,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 18. whereby
we become even <hi>darkneſſe</hi> it ſelfe, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 8. ſo voide is the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
of true knowledge, that the naturall man <hi>receiveth
not the things that are of God, they are fooliſhneſſe unto him,</hi> 1 Cor.
2. 14. nothing but confounded and amazed at ſpirituall things,
and if he doth not mocke, can doe nothing but wonder, and ſay,
<hi>what meaneth this,</hi> Act. 2. 12, 13. Secondly, we are not only blind
in our underſtandings, but <hi>captives</hi> alſo to ſinne in our wils,
<hi>Luk.</hi> 4. 18. Whereby <hi>we are ſervants to ſinne,</hi> Iohn 8. 34. Free
onely in our obedience to that Tyran, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. Yea, thirdly, all
our affections are wholly corrupted, <hi>for every imagination of the
thoughts of the heart of man is evill continually,</hi> Geneſ. 6. 5. While
we are in the fleſh, the motions of ſinne doe worke in our mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
to bring forth fruit unto death: <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 5.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the endowments of our nature, theſe are the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations
of our hearts for the grace of God, which we have
within our ſelves. Nay,</p>
               <p>Secondly, there is not onely an <hi>impotencie,</hi> but an <hi>enmitie</hi> in
corrupted nature, to any thing ſpiritually good. <hi>The things that
are of God, are fooliſhneſſe unto a naturall man:</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 14. And
there is nothing that men doe more hate, and contemne, then
that which they account as folly. They mock at it, as a ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
drunkenneſſe, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 13. And would to God our dayes,
yeelded us not too evident proofes, of that univerſall oppoſition,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:155835:81"/>
that is betweene <hi>light</hi> and <hi>darkeneſſe, Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Beliall, Nature</hi>
and <hi>Grace,</hi> that we could not ſee every day the prodigious iſſues
of this in-bred corruption, ſwelling over all bounds, and break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth into a contempt of the Goſpel, and all wayes of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
So true it is, that the <hi>carnall minde is enmitie againſt God,
it is not ſubiect unto his law, neither indeed can it be:</hi> Rom. 8.
7. So that,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, as a naturall man by the ſtrength of his owne free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will,
neither knoweth, nor willeth, ſo it is utterly impoſſible
he ſhould doe any thing pleaſing unto God. <hi>Can the Aethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian
change his skin, or the Leopard his ſpots, then can he doe good:
Ieremy</hi> 13. An evill tree cannot bring forth good fruit, <hi>without
faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God:</hi> Heb. 11. 6. And <hi>that is not of
our ſelves, it is the gift of God,</hi> Epheſ. 2. So that though Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
God, according to the unſearchableneſſe of his wiſedome,
worketh divers waies, and in ſundry manners, for the tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of his choſen ones, from the power of darkeneſſe to his
marvellous light, calling ſome powerfully in the middeſt of their
march in the wayes of ungodlineſſe, as he did <hi>Paul,</hi> preparing
others, by outward meanes, and helpes of common reſtraining
grace, moralizing nature before it bee gotten anew by the
immortall ſeed of the Word, yet this is certaine, that all good
in this kinde, is from his free grace, there is nothing in our ſelves,
as of our ſelves, but ſinne: yea, and all thoſe previous diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
wherewith our hearts are prepared by vertue of common
grace, doe not at all enable us to concurre by any vitall operation,
with that powerfull bleſſed renewing grace of regeneration,
whereby we become the ſonnes of God. Neither is there any
diſpoſition unto grace ſo remote, as that poſſibly it can proceed
from a meere facultie of nature, for every ſuch diſpoſition, muſt
be of the ſame order with the forme that is to be introduced, but
Nature in reſpect of Grace, is a thing of an inferiour allay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
which there is no proportion: a good uſe of gifts, may
have a promiſe of an addition of more, provided it be in the ſame
kinde. There is no rule, law, or promiſe, that ſhould make grace
due, upon the good uſe of naturall endowments. But you will
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:155835:81"/>
ſay, here I quite overthrow Free-will, which before I ſeemed
to grant; to which I anſwer: That in regard of that object, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
which now we treat, a naturall man hath no ſuch thing
as Free-will at all, if you take it for <hi>a power</hi> of doing that which
is good and well pleaſing unto God in things ſpirituall, for <hi>an
abilitie,</hi> of preparing our hearts unto faith and calling upon God,
as our Church Article ſpeakes, <hi>a home-bred ſelfe-ſufficiencie,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
the change of our wils by the Almightie grace of God,
whereby any good ſhould be ſaid to dwell in us, and we utterly
deny that there is any ſuch thing in the world. The will, though
in it ſelfe radically free, yet in reſpect of the terme or object, to
which in this regard it ſhould tend, is corrupted, enthralled, and
under a miſerable bondage, tied to ſuch a neceſſitie of ſinning in
generall, that though unregenerate men are not reſtrained to
this, or that ſinne in particular, yet for the maine, they can doe
nothing but ſinne. All their actions wherein there is any mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
are attended with iniquitie, <hi>an evill tree cannot bring forth
good fruit, even the ſacrifice of the wicked, is an abomination to the
Lord.</hi> Theſe things being thus cleered from the Scripture, the
former <hi>Arminian</hi> poſitions will of themſelves fall to the ground,
having no foundation but their owne authoritie, for any pretence
of proofe they make none from the word of God. The firſt two
I conſidered in the laſt Chapter, and now adde onely concerning
the third, <hi>That the ſole cauſe why the Goſpel is ſent unto ſome, and
not unto others,</hi> is not any dignitie, worth, or deſert of it in them
to whom it is ſent, more then in the reſt, that are ſuffered to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
in the ſhadow of death, but onely the ſole good pleaſure
of God, that it may be a ſubſervient meanes for the execution
of his Decree of Election. <hi>I have much people in this citie:</hi> Acts
20. <hi>I thanke thee Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou haſt
hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, and haſt revealed them
unto babes, even ſo Father, for ſo it ſeemed good in thy ſight:</hi> Mat.
11. 25, 26. So that the <hi>Arminian</hi> oppoſition to the truth of the
Goſpel in this particular, is cleerely manifeſt.</p>

aſſigne to the <hi>grace of God,</hi> in performing the
great worke of our Converſion, may plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
from what I have ſhewed already, that they
aſcribe to our <hi>owne free-will:</hi> So that I ſhall briefly
paſſe that over, which otherwiſe is ſo copiouſly delivered in
holy Scripture, that it would require a farre larger diſcuſſion.
A prolixe confirmation of the truth we profeſſe, will not ſuit ſo
well with my intention, which is meerly to make <hi>a diſcovery</hi> of
their errors, by not knowing the depths whereof, ſo many are
deceived and inveigled.</p>
               <p>Two things in this great conjunction of grace and nature, the
<hi>Arminians</hi> aſcribe unto <hi>Free-will:</hi> Firſt, <hi>a power of co-operation</hi>
and working with grace, to make it at all effectuall. Secondly,
<hi>a power of reſiſting</hi> its operation, and making it altogether in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall:
God in the meane time beſtowing no grace, but what
awaits an act iſſuing from one of theſe two abilities, and hath its
effect accordingly. If a man will co-operate, then grace attaines
its end; if he will reſiſt, it returnes emptie. To this end they
feigne all the grace of God beſtowed upon us, for our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
to be but <hi>a morall perſwaſion</hi> by his word, not an infuſion of
a new <hi>vitall principle</hi> by the powerfull working of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
And indeed granting this, I ſhall moſt willingly comply with
them, in aſſigning to <hi>Free-will</hi> one of the endowments before
recited, <hi>a power of reſiſting the operation of grace:</hi> but inſtead of
the other, muſt needs aſcribe to our whole corrupted nature, and
every one that is partaker of it, an univerſall diſabilitie of obeying
it, or coupling in that worke which God by his grace doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend.
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:155835:83"/>
If the grace of our converſion be nothing but <hi>a morall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion,</hi>
we have no more power of obeying it, in that eſtate
wherein we are dead in ſinne, then a man in his grave hath in

and the <hi>Saints prayers</hi> in the holy Scripture, ſeeme to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne
ſuch a kinde of grace, as ſhould give us a reall internall abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
of doing that which is ſpiritually good? but it ſeemes there
is no ſuch matter: for if a man ſhould perſwade me to leape o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the <hi>Thames,</hi> or to flye in the Ayre, be he never ſo eloquent,
his ſole perſwaſion makes me no more able to doe it, then I was
before ever I ſaw him. If Gods grace be nothing but a <hi>ſweet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion</hi>
(though never ſo powerfull) it is a thing <hi>extrinſecall,</hi>
conſiſting in the propoſall of a deſired object, but gives us no new
ſtrength at all, to doe any thing we had not before a power to
doe. But let us heare them pleading themſelves to each of theſe
particulars concerning Grace and Nature; and firſt for the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God hath appointed to ſave beleevers by grace, that is a ſoft and
ſweet perſwaſion, convenient and agreeing to their free-will, and not
by any Almighty action,</hi> ſaith<note n="a" place="margin">Deus ſtatuit ſalvare crede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes per gratia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, id eſt Ienem ac ſuavem liberoque ipſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum arbit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Arminius.</hi> It ſeemes ſomething
ſtrange, that the <hi>carnall minde</hi> being enmitie againſt God, and
the <hi>will inthralled to ſinne,</hi> and full of wretched oppoſition to all
his wayes, yet God ſhould have no other meanes to worke them
over unto him, but ſome perſwaſion that is ſweet, agreeable and
congruous unto them, in that eſtate wherein they are: and a
ſmall exaltation it is of the dignitie and power of grace, when the
chiefe reaſon why it is effectuall, as <hi>Alvarez</hi> obſerves, may
be reduced to a well digeſted ſupper, or an indiſturbed ſleepe,
whereby ſome men may be brought into better temper then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie,
to comply with this congruous grace. But let us for the
preſent accept of this, and grant that God doth call ſome by ſuch
a congruous perſwaſion, at ſuch a time, and place, as he knows
they will aſſent unto it. I aske whether God thus calleth all men,
or onely ſome? if all, why are not all converted? for the very
granting of it to be congruous, makes it effectuall. If onely ſome,
then why they and not others? Is it out of a ſpeciall intention to
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:155835:83"/>
have them obedient? but let them take heed, for this will goe
neere to eſtabliſh the decree of election: and out of what other
intention it ſhould be,<note place="margin">Corvin. ad Molin.</note> they ſhall never be able to determine
Wherefore <hi>Corvinus</hi> denies that any ſuch <hi>congruitie</hi> is required

then the <hi>Arminians,</hi> granting that it workes upon us, when af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the manner of bruit beaſts, we are ſet meerely on earthly
things: but theſe, as they confeſſe, <hi>that</hi>
                  <note n="e" place="margin">Vt autem aſſenſus hic eliciatur in nobis, duo in primis neceſſaria ſunt. 1. Argumenta talia ex parte: Dei, quibus nihil veri ſimiliter opponi poteſt cur credibilia non ſint. 2. Pia dociti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>for the production of

God, to which nothing can probably be oppoſed, why they ſhould not
ſeeme credible: ſo there is</hi> (ſay they) <hi>required on our part, a pious
docilitie and probitie of minde.</hi> So that all the grace of God beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on us, conſiſteth in <hi>perſwaſive arguments</hi> out of the word,
which if they meet with teachable mindes, may worke their
converſion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, having thus extenuated the grace of God, they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme,
<note n="f" place="margin">Vt gratia ſit efficax in actu ſecundo pandet à libera voluntate: Rem. Apol. fol. 164.</note> 
                  <hi>That in operation the efficacie thereof dependeth on Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will,</hi>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:155835:84"/>
ſo the Remonſtrants in their Apologie. <hi>And</hi>

                  <hi>to ſpeake
confidently,</hi> ſaith <hi>Grevinchovius, I ſay, that the effect of grace, in an
ordinary courſe dependeth on ſome act of our free-will.</hi> Suppoſe
then that of two men made partakers of the ſame grace, that is,
have the Goſpel preached unto them by the ſame meanes, one is
converted, and the other is not; What may be the cauſe of this
ſo great a difference? Was there any intention or purpoſe in
God, that one ſhould be changed rather then the other? No:
<hi>He equally deſireth and intendeth the converſion of all and every one.</hi>
Did then God worke more powerfully in the heart of the one, by
his holy Spirit then of the other? No: <hi>The ſame operation of the
ſpirit alwayes accompanieth the ſame preaching of the word.</hi> But
was not one by ſome Almightie action, made partaker of reall
infuſed grace, which the other attained not unto? No: <hi>for that
would deſtroy the liberty of his will, and deprive him of all the praiſe
of beleeving.</hi> How then came this extreme difference of effects?
Who made the one differ from the other, or what hath he, that
he did not receive? <hi>Why all this procedeth meerly from the ſtrength
of his owne free-will, yeelding obedience to Gods gracious invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which like the other he might have reiected. This is the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
cauſe of his converſion, to which all the praiſe thereof is due.</hi>
And here the <hi>old Idol</hi> may glory to all the world, that if he can
but get his worſhippers to prevaile in this, he hath quite exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the grace of Chriſt, and made it <hi>nomen inane,</hi> a meere title,
whereas there is no ſuch thing in the world.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they teach, <hi>That notwithſtanding any purpoſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of God to convert, and ſo to ſave a ſinner, notwithſtanding
the moſt powerfull and effectuall operation of the bleſſed ſpirit, with
the moſt winning perſwaſive preaching of the word, yet it is in the
power of a man, to fruſtrate that purpoſe, reſiſt that operation, and
reiect that preaching of the Goſpell.</hi> I ſhall not need to prove this,
for it is that, which in direct tearmes they plead for: which alſo
they muſt doe, if they will comply with their former principles.
For granting all theſe to have no influence upon any man, but by
the way of morall perſwaſion, we muſt not onely, grant that it
may be reſiſted, but alſo utterly deny, that it can be obeyed. We
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:155835:84"/>
may reſiſt it I ſay, as having both a diſability to good, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancie
againſt it: but for obeying it, unleſſe we will deny
all inherent corruption and depravation of nature, we cannot
attribute any ſuch ſufficiency unto our ſelves.</p>
               <p>Now concerning this weaknes of grace, that it is not able to
overcome the oppoſing power of ſinfull nature, one teſtimony
of <hi>Arminius</hi> ſhall ſuffice,<note n="h" place="margin">Manet ſemper in poteſtate Lib. Arbit. gratiam datam rejicere &amp; ſubſequentem repudiare, quae gratia non eſt omnipotens Dei, action cui reſiſti à libero hominis arbitrio non poſſit. Armin. Antip: fol. 243:</note> 
                  <hi>It alwaies remaineth in the power
of Free-will, to reiect grace that is given, and to refuſe that
which followeth, for grace is no Almightie action of God to which
Free-will cannot reſiſt.</hi> Not that I would aſſert in oppoſition to
this, ſuch an operation of grace, as ſhould as it were, violently
overcome the will of man, and force him to obedience, which
muſt needs bee prejudicial unto our libertie: but onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
in ſuch a ſweet effectuall working, as doth infallibly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
our converſion, make us willing, who before were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing:
and obedient, who were not obedient, that createth
cleane hearts, and reneweth right ſpirits within us.</p>
               <p>That then which we aſſert in oppoſition to theſe <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian
Heterodoxies is, that the effectuall grace which God uſeth
in the great worke of our converſion, by reaſon of its owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
being alſo the inſtrument of, and Gods intention for that
purpoſe, doth ſurely produce the effect intended; without ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſefull
reſiſtance, and ſolely, without any conſiderable co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of our owne wils, untill they are prepared and changed by
that very grace.</hi> The infallibilitie of its effect depends chiefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
on the purpoſe of God, when by any meanes he intends a
mans converſion, thoſe meanes muſt have ſuch an efficacie ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
unto them, as may make them fit inſtruments for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment
of that intention: that the counſell of the Lord
may proſper, and his word not returne empty. But the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of its operation, that it requires no humane aſſiſtance, and
is able to overcome all repugnance, is proper to the being of
ſuch an act, as wherein it doth conſiſt. Which nature and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie
of grace, in oppoſition to an indifferent influence of the
holy Spirit, a metaphoricall motion, a working by the way of
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:155835:85"/>
morall perſwaſion, onely propoſing a deſireable object, eaſie
to be reſiſted, and not effectuall unleſſe it be helped by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
abilitie of our owne, which is the <hi>Arminian</hi> grace, I will
briefly confirme, having promiſed theſe few things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, although God doth not uſe the wills of men in their
converſion, as maligne Spirits uſe the members of men in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſmes,
by a violently wreſted motion, but ſweetly and
agreeably to their owne free nature; yet in the firſt act of our
converſion, the will is meerely paſſive, as a capable ſubject of
ſuch a worke, not at all concurring co-operatively to our turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
It is not, I ſay, the cauſe of the worke, but the ſubject
wherein it is wrought, having only a paſſive capabilitie for the
receiving of that ſupernaturall being which is introduced by
grace. <hi>The beginning of this good worke is meerely from God,
Phil.</hi> 1. 6. Yea faith is aſcribed unto grace, not by the way of
conjunction with, but of oppoſition unto our wils: <hi>not of our
ſelves, it is the gift of God:</hi> Epheſ. 2. 8. <hi>Not that we are ſufficient
of our ſelves, our ſufficiency is of God:</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 5. <hi>Turne thou
me, O Lord, and I ſhall be turned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, though the will of man conferreth nothing to the
infuſion of the firſt grace, but a ſubjective receiving of it, yet
in the very firſt act, that is wrought in and by the will, it moſt
freely co-operateth (by the way of ſubordination) with the
grace of God: and the more effectually it is moved by grace,
the more freely it worketh with it. Man being converted, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verteth
himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we doe not affirme grace to be <hi>irreſiſtible,</hi> as though
it came upon the will, with ſuch an over-flowing violence, as
to beat it downe before it, and ſubdue it by compulſion to what
it is no way inclinable; but if that terme muſt be uſed, it deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
in our ſenſe, onely ſuch an unconquerable efficacie of grace,
as alwaies and infallibly produceth its effect. For, <hi>Who is it that
can withſtand God?</hi> Acts 11. 17. As alſo it may be uſed on the
part of the will it ſelfe, which will not reſiſt it: <hi>all that the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:155835:85"/>
Father gives unto Chriſt will come unto him:</hi> Ioh. 6. 37. The ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of grace is reſiſted by no hard heart, becauſe it mollifies
the heart it ſelfe. It doth not ſo much take away a power of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting,
as give a will of obeying, whereby the powerfull impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie
of reſiſtance, is removed.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Concerning grace it ſelfe, it is either common,
or ſpeciall: common or generall grace, conſiſteth in the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
revelation of the will of God by his word, with ſome illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of the mind to perceive it, and correction of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
not to much to contemne it: and this in ſome degree
or other, to ſome more to ſome leſſe, is common to all that are
called: ſpeciall grace, is the grace of regeneration compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
the former, adding more ſpirituall acts, but eſpecially
preſuppoſing the purpoſe of God, on which its efficacy doth
chiefly depend.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, This ſaving grace, whereby the Lord converteth or
regenerateth a ſinner, tranſlating him from death to life, is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
externall or internall, externall conſiſteth in the preaching
of the word, &amp;c. whoſe operation is by the way of morall
perſwaſion, when by it <hi>we beſeech our hearers in Chriſts ſtead,
that they would be reconciled unto God,</hi> 2 Corinth. 5. 20. and
this in our converſion is the inſtrumentall organ thereof: and
may be ſaid to be a ſufficient cauſe of our regeneration, in as
much, as no other in the ſame kinde is neceſſary: it may alſo
be reſiſted <hi>in ſenſa diviſo,</hi> abſtracting from that conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
wherein it is looked on as the inſtrument of God for ſuch
an end.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, internall grace, is by Divines diſtinguiſhed into the
firſt, or preventing grace, and the ſecond following coopera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
grace, the firſt is that ſpirituall, vitall principle that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
into us by the holy Spirit, that new creation, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing
of new ſtrength, whereby we are made fit and able
for the producing of ſpirituall acts to beleeve and yeeld Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall
obedience: <hi>For we are the workmanſhip of God created
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:155835:86"/>
in Chriſt Ieſus unto good workes,</hi> Epheſ. 2. 10. <hi>By this God
gives us a new heart, and a new ſpirit he puts within us, he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
the ſtony hearts out of our fleſh, and gives us a heart of fleſh,
he puts his ſpirit within us, to cauſe us to walke in his ſtatues,</hi>
Ezek. 36. 26, 27.</p>
               <p>Now this firſt grace is not properly and formally a vitall
act, but <hi>cauſaliter</hi> only, in being a principle moving to ſuch
vitall acts within us. It is, the habit of faith beſtowed upon a
man, that he may be able to elicate and performe the acts
thereof; giving new light to the underſtanding, new inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to the will, and new affections unto the heart. For the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
efficacie of which grace, it is that we plead againſt the
<hi>Arminians,</hi> and amongſt thoſe innumerable places of holy
Scripture confirming this truth, I ſhall make uſe only of a very
few reduced to theſe three heads.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Our converſion is wrought by a divine Almighty acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which the will of man will not, and therefore cannot reſiſt:
the impotency thereof, ought not to be oppoſed to this omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent
grace, which will certainly effect the worke, for which
it is ordained: being an action not inferiour to the greatneſſe
of his <hi>mightie power, which he wrought in Chriſt when he raiſed
him from the dead,</hi> Epheſ. 1. 19, 20. and ſhall not that power
which could overcome hell, and looſe the bonds of death, be
effectuall for the raiſing of a ſinner, from the death of ſinne,
when by Gods intention it is appointed unto that worke. <hi>He
accompliſheth the worke of faith with power:</hi> 2 Theſſ. 1. 11. It
is <hi>his divine power, that gives unto us all things that appertaine
to life and godlineſſe: 2 Pet.</hi> 1. 3. ſurely a morall reſiſtible per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion,
would not be thus often tearmed the power of God,
which denoteth an actuall efficacie, to which no creature is
able to reſiſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That which conſiſteth in a reall efficiency, and is not
at all, but when and where it actually worketh, what it intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
cannot without a contradiction be ſaid to be ſo reſiſted that
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:155835:86"/>
it ſhould not worke, the whole nature thereof conſiſting in
ſuch a reall operation: Now that the very eſſence of divine
grace conſiſteth in ſuch a formall act, may be proved by all thoſe
places of Scripture, that affirme God by his grace, or the grace
of God, actually to accompliſh our converſion: as <hi>Deut. 30. 6.
And the Lord thy God will circumciſe thy heart, and the heart of
thy ſeed, to love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and all thy
ſoule that thou mayeſt live.</hi> The circumciſion of our hearts, that
we may love the Lord with all our hearts, and with all our ſouls,
is our converſion, which the Lord affirmeth here, that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
will doe: not only enable us to doe it, but he himſelfe
really and effectually will accompliſh it: And againe, <hi>I will put
my Law into them, and write it in their hearts,</hi> Ierem. 31. 33. <hi>I
will put my feare in their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from
me,</hi> Chap. 32. 39. he will not offer his feare unto them, but actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
put it into them, and moſt clearely, <hi>Ezek. 36. 26. A new
heart alſo will I give you, a new ſpirit will I put within you, and I
will take the ſtony heart out of your fleſh, and I will give you an
heart of fleſh: and I will put my ſpirit within you, and cauſe you
to walke in my ſtatutes.</hi> Are theſe expreſſions of a morall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion
only? doth God affirme here he will doe, what he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
only to perſwade us to? and which we may refuſe to do
if we will? is it in the power of a ſtony heart to remove it ſelf?
what an active ſtone is this in mounting upwards? what doth
it at all differ from that heart of fleſh that God promiſeth? ſhall
a ſtony heart be ſaid to have a power to change it ſelfe into ſuch
a heart of fleſh as ſhall cauſe us to walke in Gods Statutes?
Surely, unleſſe men were wilfull blind, they muſt needs here
perceive ſuch an action of God denoted, as effectually, ſolely,
and infallibly worketh our converſion, <hi>opening our hearts that
we may attend unto the word,</hi> Acts 16. 14. <hi>Granting us on the
behalfe of Chriſt to beleeve in him,</hi> Philip. 1. 29. Now theſe and
the like places prove, both the nature of Gods grace to conſiſt
in a reall efficiency, and the operation thereof to be certainly
effectuall.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, our converſion is a <hi>new creation, a reſurrection, a
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:155835:87"/>
new birth.</hi> Now he that createth a man, doth not perſwade
him to create himſelfe, neither can he if he ſhould, nor hath he
any power to reſiſt him that will create him, that is, as we now
take it, tranſlate him from ſome thing that he is, to what he is
not. What arguments doe you thinke were ſufficient to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
a dead man to riſe? or what great aid can he contribute
to his own reſurrection? neither doth a man beget himſelfe,
a new reall forme was never yet introduced into any matter by
ſubtle arguments. Theſe are the tearmes the Scripture is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to uſe concerning our converſion: <hi>If any man be in Chriſt
he is a new creature,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 17. <hi>The new man after God is
created in righteouſneſſe and holineſſe,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 24. it is our new
birth, <hi>Except a man be borne againe, he cannot ſee the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God,</hi> Ioh. 3. 3. <hi>Of his own will begat he us with the word
of truth, Iam.</hi> 1. 18. and ſo we become borne againe, <hi>Not of
corruptible ſeed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God which
liveth and abideth for ever, 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 23. it is our vivification and
reſurrection, <hi>The ſonne quickeneth whom he will, Ioh.</hi> 5. 21. even
thoſe <hi>dead who heare his voice and live,</hi> verſ. 25. <hi>When we were
dead in ſins we are quickned together with Chriſt by grace,</hi> Epheſ.
2. 5. <hi>For being buried with him by Baptiſme, we are alſo riſen
with him through the faith of the operation of God,</hi> Coloſſ. 2. 12.
and bleſſed, and holy is he that hath part in that firſt reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
