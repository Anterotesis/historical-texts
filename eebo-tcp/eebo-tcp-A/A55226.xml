            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AMONGST the encouragements which I have had to proceed in explaining some of the lesser Prophets, have been your Lordships perswasions, which deservedly ought to have with me the force of commands. The same have given me boldness to recommend this part of that Work to your Lordships Patronage: by whose countenancing of it, others will be encouraged to look into it with hopes of receiving some benefit by it. That which is presented to your hands is an Exposition on <hi>Malachi,</hi> the last of the Prophets, as in order, so in time: and even for that reason by me chosen to fix my thoughts on, before others, because nearest, therefore, in conjunction with the Gospell; to which it leads us by the hand, and delivers us over: for that begins where he ends; so that from that, looking back, according to our Saviours own direction to search the Scriptures of the old Testament, which testify of him, for confirmation of the new; and to see how, what in this is recorded as done, was in that foretold as to be done; we presently light on those things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Christ and his forerunner <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> with report of which the Gospell begins, so clearly set down by this last of the Prophets, as that we cannot but admire that the Jews of those times did not at the appearance of them in their offices, without more adoe, confess, That what <hi>Malachi</hi> prophesied, was now come to pass, and acknowledge, That both <hi>Elias,</hi> the Lords Messenger, whom he would send to prepare the way before him; and the Lord of the Temple, whom they sought, even the Messenger of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, whom they delighted in (they that were to come) were come, and
<pb facs="tcp:33128:3"/>
they were to look for no other: And no less is it to be wondred, that their posterity should, even to this day, continue in the like obstinacy, and shut their eies against these manifest truths; notwithstanding they have long since seen fully executed on their Nation all those heavy things which in this Prophecy also were denounced against such as should not embrace them. Yet do they, taking no notice of these things, perversly still stand out, and seek all waies, by false glosses, absurd misinterpretations and misapplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of these Prophecies so long since fulfilled, as if they were things yet to come, to elude them, and deceive themselves and their posterity. Their cavils I have endeavoured, as God hath enabled me, to remove; and so by asserting the place for Christs Birth designed by <hi>Micah,</hi> and the time for his coming by <hi>Malachi,</hi> to clear the way for the better understanding of all such other Prophecies as foretold of other things in and by him to be fulfilled, and by the exact accomplishment of which the Gospell proves him to be the <hi>CHRIST.</hi> These I thought convenient, therefore, to begin with, as the Gospell doth, as preceding in execution divers others that were before them uttered. The due fulfilling of these, and the nature of them being vindicated from the Glosses of the Jews, the other will be better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood; and such cavils also as are brought in the expounding of them, be easier removed, the being and coming of him whom they concern being esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished. What I have done in this kind, or any other which may conduce to the true meaning of this Prophet, I must humbly submit to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your Lordship and others. Whatever the Work be, I desire it may be a testimony of my dutiful respects and gratitude to your Lordship, in many years enjoiment of whose love and friendship I have been formerly happy, and now more in that I see that the change of your Lordships condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to an higher degree of dignity in the Church, hath nothing altered your affections, of which I have real proof in your Lordships favor shewed to some of mine for my sake. Long may your Lordship continue in health and happiness, to be an instrument of promoting Gods glory and the good of the Church. So are the hearty prayers of</p>

                  <hi>THE burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi.</hi>] Whereas there is nothing elsewhere spoken of this Prophet in Canonical Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, it hath given occasion of several con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures concerning him. His name being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted signifying, <hi>my Angel,</hi> or <hi>my Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger,</hi> hath made <note n="a" place="bottom">See the Prologue to Mal. in Bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. Mag.</note> some to think, that he was an Angel appearing in form of a man, for the delivery of Gods Message to the People of that time. But this opinion by <note n="b" place="bottom">Hierom. Praesat. in Mal.</note> some ancient Christians of great authority entertain'd, is by others that followed, deservedly rejected, as having no solid grounds. If any will make any inference from the derivation of the name, he may rather think him design'd as a <note n="c" place="bottom">Chr. à Castro.</note> man of holy, Angelical, qualities, or in office re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling an Angel, rather then a natural An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel. A man therefore he is taken to be; but who is that man? An ancient Jewish <note n="d" place="bottom">See Abarbinel in Mal. è Talmud M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gillah, c. 1. p. 15.</note> Doctor would make him the same with <hi>Mordecai,</hi> but having no ground for it, is not by others fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. That wherein <note n="e" place="bottom">Idem, and Kimchi. R. Solom. in cap. II.10. Ch. à Castro.</note> more of them agree, and among them the Chalde Paraphrast also, is, that he was the same with <hi>Esdras,</hi> to which divers Christians also seem to encline. <note n="f" place="bottom">Ribera.</note> But the Arguments brought to prove it, on exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation are no way convincing: and therefore the truer and more probable <note n="g" place="bottom">R. Ab. Ezra. Kimchi. R. Tanch. Abarbinel.</note> opinion is, that he was a distinct Prophet, call'd by this name <hi>Malachi</hi>; a name well agreeing to, and atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting his function, as a Prophet sent by God in his message. He prophesied after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of the Jews from the Babylonish capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and the rebuilding of the Temple, and was the last of the Prophets that God sent to them, leaving them for the future to expect the coming of Christ and to long after it, for farther manifestation of his will. Of Christ and his forerunner <hi>John Baptist,</hi> he most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently prophesied, and till their coming God left them for directions to the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> Chap. IV.4. The Authority of his Prophecy is asserted in the New Testament, where it is cited, <hi>Matth.</hi> XI.10. <hi>Mark</hi> I.2. <hi>Luk.</hi> I.16. and VII.27. <hi>Rom.</hi> IX.13. and elsewhere. <note n="h" place="bottom">R. Tanchum.</note> The Tradition of the Jews is, that Prophecy remained among them 40 years under the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Temple: in which time <hi>Haggai</hi> and <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary,</hi> and <hi>Malachi</hi> prophesied: of which <hi>Malachi</hi> was the last: and so his Prophecy concludes the Books of the Prophets; it ends with the Promise of him, with the history of whom the Gospel begins, <hi>viz. John the Baptist,</hi> and his preaching Repentance.</p>

I.1.</note> But I suppose this nicety, as concerning the signification of <hi>burden,</hi> and <hi>burdensomeness</hi> is not to be insisted on in the Interpretation of the word. My ground is, because the <hi>Israelites</hi> seem reproved for so using or understanding it, <hi>Jerem.</hi> XXIII.34. <hi>&amp;c. As for the Prophet and the Priest and the People that shall say, The burden of the Lord, I will even punish that man and his house.

Here seems a prohibition for taking the word in that sense: The occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of which, according to the exposition of divers of the best <note n="l" place="bottom">R. D. Kimchi.

God therefore seeing the evil mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their hearts (though otherwise their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage seemed to be such as was usual for si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifying that which they enquired after, and to have no harm in it) discovers their hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisy to the Prophet, and charges them with perverting his word in their use of it, and therefore forbids them any more so to abuse it, but if they would enquire of the Prophet to do it in other words, <hi>viz. what hath the Lord answered? or what hath the Lord spoken?</hi> which was as much as was by that word meant, when it was used by the Prophets, and should have been meant by them when they used it, but was perverted and abused by them to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other meaning. Hence taking directions we conceive that here (as in other places) the word is not strictly to be taken in the harsh signification of a <hi>grievous</hi> or <hi>heavy burden,</hi> but rather as a <hi>burden</hi> (if we may take the word in a gentler sense) or <hi>Message</hi> 
                  <note n="o" place="bottom">See R. Sol. and the rest.</note> taken or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from God to be delivered to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. That it doth not alwaies import heavy or burdensome words or messages may appear by its use, <hi>Zach.</hi> XII.1. where it is prefixed to the promises of good things to <hi>Israel,</hi> not heavy things against them: as likewise <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> II.14. where the pretended Prophecies of their false Prophets are called <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>The word therefore being of such latitude, we need not here press its signification of what is <hi>burdensom,</hi> but in its larger notion looking on it, take it as sufficient for the meaning of what is here delivered, that it is the <note n="p" place="bottom">The Vision of the Word of the Lord.

                  <hi>message</hi> or import of the word of the Lord: a Prophecy from him received, and by his commission deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the hand or ministery of <hi>Malachi, to Israel.</hi> Which Name, as before the division of the two Kingdoms of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Israel,</hi> it was common to the twelve Tribes, though afterwards it became a peculiar title to the ten Tribes: so here it is given to the two Tribes, and to all of the other who join'd themselves to them in their return from <hi>Babylon.</hi> These having had late experience of Gods great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor in turning their captivity, and restoring them to their own Land, and again settling his worship among them, should have been very careful in reforming their waies, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere in their obedience: but it was otherwise. Many enormities, and actions contrary to Gods Law, and displeasing to him, and signs of their great ingratitude to him, and unmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of his benefits, were found among them: for which therefore, seeking still their good, he sends this his Prophet to reprove them, and to exhort them to repentance; and for the comfort of the godly among them, to give them assurance of the coming of the promised Messiah in his due time, to set all things right for their good: as will in order appear in what follows of this Prophecy, which thus begins,
<q>
                     <p n="2">
                        <hi>2</hi> I have loved you, saith the Lord: yet ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us? <hi>was</hi> not Esau Jacobs brother? saith the Lord: yet I loved Jacob.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>I have loved you, saith the Lord.</hi>] Here seems intimated a reproof of <hi>Israel</hi> for their great ingratitude and unkindness to the Lord, whilst he tells them, that certainly they ought to have loved him, since that he had first loved them, and ought therefore to have found gratefull returns of love from them: but how contrary behaviour he found from them, he shews in that Question, which he saies, that instead of a ready acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his love they were ready to put; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying little less then an absolute denyal of his kindness, <hi>Yet ye say, wherein hast thou loved us?</hi> So that he sees it necessary by a particular instance or proof in the next words, to make evident wherein he had shewed his love to them. <hi>Was not,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The scope and sense will be much the same,

if with <note n="q" place="bottom">Chald. Paraph. and Arab. Vers. MS. R. D. Kimchi. R. Tanchum.</note> others we interpret those words, <hi>yet ye say,</hi> by, <hi>And if ye say, wherein,</hi> &amp;c. it will still intimate their ingratitude, and that they were ready so to say; and that it was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to prevent or answer that perverse Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, by confirming by that instance given what he had said, <hi>I have loved you, viz.</hi> with greater love then ordinary, and shewed to you greater tokens of love then to others. Another learned <note n="r" place="bottom">Abarb.</note> Jew reads the Question put something differently: not <hi>wherein,</hi> as if they utterly denied Gods love to them, which was manifest to all, but <hi>wherefore hast thou loved us</hi>? as if they should intimate that there was some reason for it, why he should love them; <hi>viz.</hi> in requital of their Father <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s love to him; so that it was not a free love and mercy to them, but a love (as it were) of debt, due to them for <hi>Abraham</hi>'s sake, and then the instance given shews how perverse this thought of theirs was. For if it had been only so much love as was due in requital of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s love to him, why then had not <hi>Esau,</hi> who was descended as well of <hi>Abraham</hi> as <hi>Jacob,</hi> had as much right to it, and as great a share in it as <hi>Jacob</hi>; his poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as they. Whereas by Gods loving <hi>Jacob,</hi> and hating <hi>Esau</hi> his twin-brother, 'twas made manifest that there was more in it then so; and that his peculiar love of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial favors to his posterity, were not for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>'s desert alone, but of free grace and mercy to them, and therefore deserved all possible returns of love, gratitude, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience from them. This he makes to be the meaning and connexion of the words, which though in his way it may seem plain, yet is there no need to leave the former interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Was not Esau Jacob's brother? saith the Lord; yet I loved Jacob, and I hated Esau.</hi>] This the Lord gives as an instance of his free love to the <hi>Israelites,</hi> the posterity of <hi>Jacob,</hi> that whereas <hi>Esau</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> were twin-bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, one as well as the other descended from <hi>Abraham,</hi> both sons of <hi>Isaac,</hi> by one mother, twins, born at the same time, yet he loved one, and did not love, or hated, the other, and so derived that love and hatred to their posterity, and accordingly shewed to them the tokens and effects thereof. The Apostle S. <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> IX.11, 13. improveth this argument from hence, that this love to the one, and hatred to the other was declared; when those children were not yet born, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had done any good or evil. So that it could not be said one had deserved better then the other, and therefore his love to one above the other must needs appear to be of ftee grace and choice, electing one and rejecting the other; and the distinction or difference that he made between them may be illustrated by the several advantages that by his love one had over the other in several matters concerning both their spiritual and temporal estate. But the literal explication of the words here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, requires no more then the view of the particular effect of his love to <hi>Jacob</hi>'s po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity, and hatred to <hi>Esau</hi>'s here instanced in, <hi>viz.</hi> the utter desolation of <hi>Esau</hi>'s Country, and the restitution of <hi>Israel</hi>'s, when he had given them both into the hand of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to be punish'd for their sins; that punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment proving to the one for their utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, to the other but as a fatherly cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisement to make them sensible of their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and to amend them, that so they might again be reconciled to him, and taken into favor. Of <hi>Esau,</hi> therefore (or his posterity, the <hi>Edomites</hi>) he saies that he declared his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred to him (or them called by his Name, in that he <hi>laid his Mountains and his heritage wast for the Dragons of the wilderness.</hi>

That which is here given us to look on par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly as a sign of his hatred to him, being that those Mountains, and that heritage, that he then gave him, and his posterity had hitherto possessed and flourished in, he had now laid wast, and dispossessing them thereof, gave it to be inhabited by <hi>the Dragons of the Wilderness.</hi>

                  <hi>Al, upon, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,</hi> or <hi>over.</hi> The same learned Jew farther adds for explication of the sense, more words, which because his Book is not printed, nor common, it will not be amiss to give, or the meaning of them, which is, [That the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of these words together in connexion with the former is, Ye have or (shall have) assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his love to you, and providence o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you, when you see that you your selves are returned to your own Land, and have power of building and inhabiting it, but they have not power to do the like, but they build, and I throw down, and ye therefore praise (or shall praise) and magnify my name for it, saying, <hi>The Lord shall be magnified on the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Israel,</hi> that is, his greatness shall be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies manifest upon (or over) you; or else it may be supplied thus; The Lord shall be magnified, who protecteth the border of <hi>Israel,</hi> or the like. Or the meaning is said to be, It would have become you that you should so do, and have continued so to do (<hi>viz.</hi> to have taken due notice of this, and to have said, <hi>The

Or, saith he, in the opinion of some, the words <hi>from the border of Israel,</hi> are to be joined with, <hi>and ye</hi>; as if it were thus to be construed, And you that reside on (or dwell in) the border of <hi>Israel,</hi> shall say, <hi>The Lord be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnified.</hi>] Thus he, which we the rather take notice of, because it will arm us against what another <note n="l" place="bottom">Marginal additions in Miclal Yophi.</note> Jew saith that this may be interpreted, And your eies shall see the destruction of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> in the end of daies (or the last daies) and then ye shall say, <hi>The Lord be magnified from the border of Israel,</hi> that is to say, In all the World shall his name be magnified; according to what is said, <hi>Then will I turn to the People a pure language, that they may call upon the name of the Lord, to serve him with one consent, Zeph.</hi> III.9. He seems to look upon this Prophecy as not yet fulfilled, but hereafter to be fulfilled by the utter destruction of <hi>Edom,</hi> (which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly hath been long since destroyed) and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>Israel</hi> again in their Land. They willingly catch at any thing whereby to cherish them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in their fond error of expecting a Messiah yet to come, who shall restore to <hi>Israel</hi> a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Kingdom, and subdue under them all their Enemies, and cut off those whom they please to call <hi>Edom,</hi> by which name we have shewed whom they mean. He runs in this the same way that <hi>Abarbinol</hi> doth. Yet here <hi>Abarbinel,</hi> though he promise to himself a farther fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of it in that way, yet could not but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess it to be already fulfilled (<hi>viz.</hi> under the second Temple, and that restitution of <hi>Israel</hi> from their Babylonish captivity, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of <hi>Edom</hi> in those times, and therefore saith, Perhaps this Promise was spoken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning both times, <hi>viz.</hi> that so long since past, and that which they expect yet to come. The Verbs being in the Text in the future Tense, as of what was then to come, will not advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage those who would make that use thereof, as if it were yet to be expected: for though their eies had already seen <hi>Edom</hi> subdued, and their Mountains laid wast, yet there was there that which they were farther to see and admire, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Edomites</hi> should again strive to recover themselves, and rebuild their wast, as <hi>Israel</hi> had done theirs, but through the continued indignation of the Lord upon them should never be able to do it.</p>

               <p>The inference from what hath been said is plainly this, That seeing God had in thus declaring his peculiar love to them above others, whom he might for the same respects, they also being the seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> have made objects of his love, as well as them, certainly they ought to have requited him with more then ordinary love, and testified it by their obedience to him, which seeing they did not, they are justly reproveable. To shew the justness of his reproof of them, and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate the unreasonableness of their ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and perverse behaviour towards him, he in the following words proceeds farther to explain his benefits and relations that he stands in, to them, for which tokens of his love to them they ought also to have shewed such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects to him, as those relations required, but did not. He adds therefore,
<q>

                  <hi>A son honoreth</hi> his <hi>Father, and a servant his Master, &amp;c.</hi>] God had all along shewed such fatherly love to <hi>Israel</hi> and paternal care over them above all other Nations, that they could not but acknowledge him their Father: not only by a common right as he is Father of all, as Creator of all, but by a peculiar right, as having adopted them unto a greater priviledge, and nigher relation of sonship then others: and so had he by his peculiar guidance and protection, direction, and government of them, shewed himself a Lord and Master to them, that they could not deny him by a particular right of title to be so to them. This they could not, they would not deny, but rather so challenge him to themselves in these respects <note n="q" place="bottom">See how some of them explain Deut. IV.19.</note>, as if he were not so at all to other Nations, either a Father or Master to them. The word <hi>If,</hi> therefore doth not put or suppose it as a thing which they doubted, or such as in words they would deny, but such as while with their mouths they confessed, or could not but confess, they did not in their deeds make good, but rather contradicted: for if they did look on him as a Father, why did
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:33128:6"/>
they not then duly honor him; or if as a master, why did they not then reverence and fear him? and so includes a reprehension of them for not attesting to their outward profession by their respective behaviour, but by that shewed their heart not to be right with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For a son honoureth his Father, and a servant his Master.</hi>] It is their duty so to do; and they transgress not only their duty, but the ordinary custom: they who do not so, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural sons, perverse, ill natured servants: unworthy of those appellations, not doing what they require and suppose will be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by all that are called by them: and such the Questions here put, <hi>where is mine honor? and where is my fear</hi>? shew them to have been; as neither yielding to God that honor which from sons is due, and is ordinarily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to a Father; nor that fear which servants ow, and usually shew to a Master. The que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion imports a denial, <hi>viz.</hi> that they did not this their duty: and because they would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps deny themselves to be peccant in what is objected to them, he proceeds by peculiar instances to convict them as guilty; directing what hath hitherto been said more generally, as to all the People, more particularly to the Priests, who gave ill example in this kind to them, and should have taught them bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saith the Lord of Hosts unto you, O Priests that despise my Name.</hi> This reading couples these words with the foregoing part of the verse, though that seem spoken more generally to all the People, and this doth not exclude them, though <note n="r" place="bottom">See Chris. à Castro.</note> particularly directed to the Priests, as those who should have prevented such ill beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in the People, but now seemed to be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions to them of despising Gods Name by their despising it first; <note n="s" place="bottom">See Abarbinel.</note> as if his speech to the Priests began at, <hi>A son honoreth his Father,</hi> &amp;c. others putting a stop after <hi>where is my fear</hi>? or after, <hi>saith the Lord of Hosts,</hi> will have what is spoken peculiarly to the Priests to begin at <hi>The Lord of Hosts saith,</hi> or speaketh, <hi>to you, O Priests, who despise my Name, viz.</hi> The Lord accuseth you for despising his Name. This punctation seems to follow the Latin in some Copies; and <note n="t" place="bottom">Drusius.</note> others understanding, <hi>To you, O Priests, who despise my Name,</hi> I say these things. But this nicety seems of no great import. That which the Priests are accused of is, that they despise his Name, and have him in contempt, which is <note n="u" place="bottom">
                     <hi>R.</hi> D. Kimchi.</note> contrary to that honor which as a Father; and that fear and reverence, which as he is a Lord, or Master, is due unto him. This were manifestly a great fault; they seem not to think otherwise, or to justify it in themselves, but rather would ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stify themselves as not guilty of it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to say, Be it far from us, we have done no such thing, wherein have we despised thy Name? <note n="x" place="bottom">Drusius.</note> surely in nothing that we know of.

               <p>
                  <hi>Ye offer polluted bread upon mine Altar,</hi> &amp;c.] Of bread to be offered to God we read of two sorts, the one called the <hi>Shew-bread,</hi> to be set on a Table before the Lord, of which mention is made, <hi>Exod.</hi> XXV, 30. as likewise of the Table on which they were to be set in the foregoing verses, and directions for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering this bread are given, <hi>Levit.</hi> XXIV.5. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Of other bread, called, <hi>a Meat-offering,</hi> to be brought to the Altar, and part thereof to be burnt on the Altar, either as a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary oblation, we read <hi>Levit.</hi> II. or else as a necessary and commanded oblation, of which is mention, <hi>Exod.</hi> XXIX.40. and <hi>Num.</hi> XXVIII.5. <hi>&amp;c,</hi> Of the former of these sorts, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Shew-bread,</hi> will <note n="y" place="bottom">Hierom. and others.</note> some have the bread men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned understood. Against which <note n="z" place="bottom">Drus.</note> others ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that this bread here is said to be offered on the Altar, whereas that was set on a Table for that end ordained. But if there be no other difficulty, a sufficient answer to this may seem, what is given by some, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Altar</hi> here is taken for <hi>Table,</hi> as manifestly elsewhere <hi>Table</hi> is the same that <hi>Altar</hi> (as <hi>Ezek.</hi> XLI.22.) and here in this very verse what is called <hi>Altar</hi> is likewise called <hi>Table.</hi> Yet do <note n="a" place="bottom">Grotius, Riber.</note> others choose to understand <hi>Bread</hi> here rather of that meat-offering that was offered with the daily Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, which was the second sort that we mentioned, and was part of it burnt on the Altar: But both these go on the same grounds, that <hi>bread</hi> here is taken in that proper notion by that word <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:33128:7"/>
this larger notion (not as signifying only <hi>bread,</hi> which usually in the Hebrew and Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riack Languages it is taken for, nor only <hi>flesh,</hi> as in the Arabick, but as it comprehends both, yea all food or meat,) they take it here to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note any Sacrifice or Oblation offered to God on his Altar, which was as his Table, and what was thereon offered and burnt, called his food or meat: <note n="d" place="bottom">See Abarbinel and Tarnov.</note> so that under the name of <hi>polluted bread</hi> may come those blind and lame, and sick Sacrifices in the following words mentioned: yet <note n="e" place="bottom">Ribera.</note> some like not this. We need not trouble our selves in deciding the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy between these differing opinions, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute which is to be preferred. An easy way of reconciling them, and composing the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter seems that which is by a learned <note n="f" place="bottom">
                     <hi>R.</hi> Tanchum.</note> Jew suggested, <hi>viz.</hi> That there is no doubt but that the names <hi>Altar</hi> and <hi>Table</hi> may be indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently used for signifying either the Altar, or the Table of Shew-bread; and by <hi>polluted bread</hi> may be understood either bread properly so called, or else the flesh of the Sacrifices; and then whether by this variety of words he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand still the same thing, or else diverse, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Shew-bread</hi> by some of them, and the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> by others, the scope will be the same, <hi>viz.</hi> to shew the contemt they had of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and that not in one particular kind only, but in all; and to make good the accusation against them, by instancing whether in one kind or more, and passing from one to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Two faults <note n="g" place="bottom">See Abarbinel.</note> they seem here accused of; the first, that they accounted that holy enough, which was not so, <hi>viz.</hi> offerings that were pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted, that is, not so ordered as God had commanded such things as he would accept of as holy, to be ordered, and therefore reputed in his sight as unclean. Secondly, in accounting that contemtible which was in it self to be reverenced, and looked on as holy, <hi>viz.</hi> the Table, or Altar of the Lord. <note n="h" place="bottom">R. Tanchum.</note> As for the first, <hi>viz.</hi> those offerings, there was the pollution or defect in the things themselves manifest. As for the second, the fault was in themselves, in their evill and contemtuous thoughts, in that they said, or would be ready to say, at least thought in their minds, which was in his sight, or ears, as much as if they openly spake it, though perhaps they were not so impudent as openly to profess it. By doing the first they are said to despise his Name, in despising and setting light by his Ordinances, and the manner by him prescrib'd for the right performance of them; by the second, they are said to pollute him in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning that which was hallow'd to him, as despicable; the contemt of that God looks on as redounding to himself.</p>
               <p>The Question as in their person put, <hi>wherein, have we polluted thee?</hi> (as if they should say though the bread or things that we offer be polluted, yet what pollution or dishonor doth thence arise to thee?) and then Gods answer, <hi>In that ye say, The Table of the Lord is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temtible,</hi> plainly shews it, <hi>viz.</hi> That he looks on it, as if they did, as far as in them lay, pollute him himself. The contemt offered to his Table or Altar, or that whereby they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared themselves to look on it as contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, seems to consist in this, that they thought any thing though not qualified with those con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions that the Law required, good enough to offer to him on it. Why they did so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn it <note n="i" place="bottom">Hierom.</note> some give reasons, as that it was, because there was not in the Altar, now under the second Temple, that richness and splendor, and therefore neither (as they thought) that holiness that was under the first Temple, <note n="k" place="bottom">Chr à Castro, Grot. Pelicanus.</note> or in that the things offered were but few, and so their gain or income but small, or (as some <note n="l" place="bottom">Kimchi, and Abarb.</note> Jews) because there was offered on it fat and blood, and such things as they looked on as despicable, not considering why God requir'd them, or that it was enough, that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. But these are but conjectures: no ground for them in the Text. It was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly a sign of irreligion, and disrespect to God, and his worship in them, shewed in this instance of their dealing with his Table, and the things thereto belonging, (both here included together, the offerings and the Altar) for which they are therefore reproved as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temners of God; which their contemt is far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther illustrated in the next verse.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>8</hi> And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, <hi>is it</hi> not evil? and if ye offer the lame and sick, <hi>is it</hi> not evil? offer it now unto thy governor, will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person, saith the Lord of hosts.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>And if you offer the blind for Sacrifice, is it not evil?</hi>] This question put, though with a conditional particle, <hi>If,</hi> intimates that they did presume to offer such things: therefore instead of, <hi>If,</hi> 
                  <note n="m" place="bottom">Chald.</note> others put <hi>That you do offer,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>is it not evil</hi>? or, <note n="n" place="bottom">Syriac. Jun. Trem.</note> 
                  <hi>In as much,</hi> or, <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as ye offer,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>is it not evil?</hi> Do you not hereby manifestly profess your opinion that the Table of the Lord is contemtible? as if they were the words of God, and so is the consequence of these words on the former e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident. But <note n="o" place="bottom">D. Kimchi, R.

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:33128:7"/>
People that bring them to you to offer for them, that they are not evil, (as if they were their words,) they are good enough to be offered on Gods Altar; clean contrary to Gods command, <hi>Levit.</hi> XXII.22, <hi>&amp;c. Deut.</hi> XV.21. And by this doing likewise they said, or shewed that they thought the Table or Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar of the Lord contemptible, and that they despised him; for had they had any respect unto him, any reverence for his Altar, they would not have presumed to offer thereon to him such things, as they would not think to find acceptance for (or with) from any among men, who was in place or honor, and whose favor they would seek. So saith he, <hi>Offer it now to thy Governor, will he be pleased with thee?</hi> &amp;c. certainly not. Thou wouldst not think that he would accept thy person with a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent so disgraceful, so dishonorable, for him to take. He would look on it as a great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respect of his person, and disregard of his honor, and therefore be much displeased with him, that should shew so little esteem of him. How much more shall the Lord, the great Governor of the World, from whom they have all that they have, and who hath no need of any thing that they have, look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it as a great contempt to himself, <note n="p" place="bottom">R. Tanchum.</note> if they shall presume to offer to him, what they would not dare to offer to one, though in dignity and autority above them, yet a man like themselves? especially seeing he had commanded the contrary, and declared that he would have no such oblation brought to his Altar. For <note n="q" place="bottom">See Leviticus V.7, 11.</note> those that were not able to bring greater gifts, he had ordained less, and of smaller value, yet still (as a learned <note n="r" place="bottom">Maimonides in Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For though the People were much in fault for presuming to bring such illegal and undue oblations, yet much more <note n="s" place="bottom">See R. David Kimchi and Abarbinel.</note> the Priests in receiving them from them, and offering them; who should have taught them what to bring, and denied to receive what was not fit, when they brought any such, and to have refused to offer it: in that they did not this, but rather tell the People it was good enough, they shewed dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respect to God and contempt of him. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves them for it, and expects they should repent of it. So the Prophet shews in subjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing verse the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.</p>

                  <hi>And now I pray you beseech God that he will be gracious unto us, &amp;c.</hi>] A learned <note n="t" place="bottom">R. Tanchum.</note> Jew thus gives the connexion of these words with the preceding,
<q>He shews them the remedy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their disease, stirring them up to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and that they would make inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession for <hi>Israel,</hi> that so wrath might be removed from them, and they might find mercy (as he saith <hi>that he will be gracious unto us</hi>) for that belonged to the <note n="u" place="bottom">Joel II.</note> Priests, how much more, when their fault or sin was cause thereof, (<hi>viz.</hi>

Having shewed the great fault of the Priests, in their negligence in his service, and not taking care for the right ordering of things in it according to the Law, he here seems to aggravate it, in that they receive abundant wages, for what they should do, and are well paid for it, even for their least services they do, as the very shutting of the doors of the Temple, and kindling fire on his Altar. Did he require their Service for nought, as justly he might, then they might have some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for their negligence; but now being so plentifully rewarded by the portions in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming their several offices allowed them, sure if they would not out of love do it, yet in justice they ought to be carefull in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming what was required of them, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the Law required it to be performed; and seeing they are not, he is justly displeased at them, and hath no pleasure in them, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will accept an offering at their hand.

But I have heard ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions taken against our Translators for it; but those that blame them for it, should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that they go not alone in it, but have the consent both of other approved translations and learned Expositors, who seem to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it out of choice and deliberation, not because they saw no other, or were not aware that the words were by some, or might be, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise expounded.

mouth of God himself, and so then blasphemy against him, who in the Law and Prophets all along, hath shewed them and their waies to be all, most abominable to him, such as he utterly seeks to root out, and will have his People have nothing to do with. And can he be thought here to say that he accepts of what is done to Idols, as a magnifying of his Name, or what Sacrifices are offered to them, as a sweet smelling savor, or acceptable Sacrifice offered to himself?

                  <hi>Mede</hi> in his discourse on these words: where he gives to note that under the name of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Sacrifice,</hi> by the ancient Church was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, not the mere Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ, but the whole sacred action, or solemn Service of the Church as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled, whereof this sacred mystery was a prime and principal part; and therefore defines it to be <hi>An oblation of thanksgiving and praier to God the Father through Jesus Christ, and his Sacrifice commemorated in the creatures of bread and wine, wherewith God had been first agnized, viz.</hi> by them sanctified by being offered and set before him as a present to acknowledge him the Lord and giver of all.</p>
               <p>This whole Service duly performed is (as at large he there shews) deservedly stiled <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense and a pure offering,</hi> both in respect that it is purely or spiritually offered, and in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of the purity of the conscience, and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the offerers, throughly perswaded of the greatness of God, and in respect of Christ, whom it signifies and represents, who is a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice without all spot and blemish: and by this being offered to his Name in every place, he saith, the time should come, when it should be great, magnified, and acknowledged as great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong and by all Nations, though the Jews did now profane it, as he makes the connexion by rendring that, <hi>though,</hi> which our Translation renders, <hi>but.</hi> But the sense will be much alike in reading <hi>but, viz.</hi> to this purpose, <hi>the time shall come when from the rising of the Sun,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>my Name shall be great among the Gentiles,</hi> who yet have not true knowledge of me, but will when I shall see due time to reveal it to them, readily embrace it.

               <p>When these words were spoken, and thence forward, (as all along before, since the giving of the Law,) till the time of this diffusing the knowledge of God and his Name, and this alteration and reformation of his worship here spoken of, the Jews had for their direction the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and ought duly to have attended to it, as they are warned, Chap. IV.4. but they did in all things go so contrary to it, as that neither they, nor any service they did, were acceptable to God. So no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously, so obstinately peccant, were they both Priest and People, that he sees it not sufficient to have once reproved them, by reckoning up to them their faults, but again repeats them, that so they may be sensible how greatly they have offended him, how dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing it is to him, that they should conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to do such things, having been warned of them, and that it is worse then what the Gentiles, when he shall call them, will do.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Table of the Lord is polluted</hi>] his Altar not so highly to be regarded, as a sacred thing, or with so much care and reverence to be approached; <hi>and the fruit thereof, even his meat, is contemptible, viz.</hi> his meat, or its meat, or the meat thereof; for the affix is the same that in the former word, and may therefore be referred to the same person or thing: and it will be all one whether we refer it to the Table or to God; for as the Table or Altar is his, so all belonging to it is his, the fruit thereof his, the meat his.

The words so rendered, as we read, are indifferently appliable to both; and therefore in as much as both those may be called the <hi>fruit</hi> thereof, and his (or its) <hi>meat,</hi> as well what God took to himself, as that which he allotted to the Priests; they are
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:33128:10"/>
capable of a double meaning, as they are looked on with respect, either to the one or the other; 1. With respect to the first, as if their saying or thoughts of their heart were, <hi>the fruit thereof, (i. e.)</hi> that which is allotted to the Altar to be offered on it, and <hi>his meat</hi> (<note n="t" place="bottom">Aben Ezra.</note> or its fruit, its meat, <hi>i. e.</hi> which is its meat) is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, <hi>viz.</hi> being the fat, and the blood, gross and despicable things (as <note n="u" place="bottom">R.

Thus accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this rendring. But there are among the Jews who render it otherwise as to the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Nibo,</hi> which ours, with many others render <hi>the fruit thereof,</hi> reading <hi>his word</hi> or <hi>saying.</hi> And here they differ in telling us whose word they mean; <note n="z" place="bottom">Abarb.</note> some making it the Word of God, as if they said, The Table of the Lord is polluted, and his Word concerning the meat thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> by which he commands such gross things as fat and blood to be put on it, for his, or its meat, is contemptible. [This would be strange impudence in them to have said, yet thus <hi>Abarbinel</hi> among the Jews expounds it, and <hi>Montanus</hi> among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians follows him, as in many other things.] <note n="a" place="bottom">R.

For so while the Chalde expounds both the words, this and the other rendred <hi>meat</hi> put together, as denoting the same thing, <hi>the gifts of it</hi>; it is manifest that he took them both, as denoting the same thing, <hi>viz.</hi> those offerings which were brought to the Altar. And so the Greek likewise while they render, <hi>the meats</hi> (or food) that are put thereon, whom the printed Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick likewise follows, and the Syriack includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both in one word, <hi>its meats,</hi> agreeable to what a learned <note n="e" place="bottom">Aben Ezra.</note> Jew notes, that as if the two words were synonymous, or words de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noting the same thing, the putting both doth but double or repeat the same thing. <note n="f" place="bottom">R.

And as for the word that we speak of, its manifest that the Author of the ancient Latin Version took it in the same meaning, whilst he renders it, <hi>that which is laid thereupon</hi> which is that which is meant, by <hi>the fruit thereof</hi>: but then he differs from all the rest, in ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring that which is by ours rendred <hi>his meat,</hi> by, <hi>with the fire that devoureth it</hi>; taking <gap reason="foreign">

said, Behold what a weariness is it? and ye have snuffed at it, (or as in the Margin, <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as you might have blown it away,</hi> &amp;c.) Of the words so read as they (appositely to the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal) are in the text of our Translation, a plain and easy meaning may be thus para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrastically given; that they said, or so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved themselves, as if they plainly said, What a deal of toil and labour are we put to in ordering the offerings of the Altar, and the things pertaining thereto, and our selves in respect to them, according to what the Law nicely requires? And that they therefore snuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed (or puffed) at it, in token of indignation and dislike, or displeasure at it: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, or besides this, the Priests to save them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves that labour, and (the People) that cost and charges, which according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of the Law they should be at, took any illegal <note n="l" place="bottom">Levit.

But he (though nothing profited by what they offer, yet in respect of his commandment, which they were bound to obey, and that reverence and honor, which he required to be shewed to his Name and Altar) shews that he takes due notice of what they do, and how they do it, and will by no means accept or take it at their hands: <hi>Should I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept this of your hands? saith the Lord.</hi> The Question imports a negation. This exposition seems plain, and very agreeable to the words, and is warranted by the authority of learned Interpreters. As first of a Jewish Doctor <hi>R.

Other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions also he mentions, but prefers this as most agreeable to the words and place.

And so do also among Christian Expositors, <hi>Calvin,</hi> and <hi>Lud. de Dieu,</hi> who saith, the sense of the words is, you complain that you are wearied with the burthen of my Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and too much oppressed, in that ye are bound to offer to me none but of the best and soundest Cattel, and therefore ye snuff at it, and for your own ease offer to me any corrupt thing.</p>
               <p>Having the sense that we gave thus warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we might well acquiesce in it, but that our Translators in the Margin reflecting on an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other rendring, give us to look into that too, and the grounds of it; which while we do it is no little wonder to see how differently these words, which may (as before expounded) seem plain, are by Interpreters understood, and so made difficult.

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:33128:12"/>
they should not find joy and profit in. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant is this to what some also of the Jewish Expositors give. So <hi>R. D. Kimchi,</hi> who find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fault with <note n="e" place="bottom">Abu Walid.</note> one before him, who restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth here <hi>Blessings</hi> to the signification of <hi>offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> or gifts, which it sometimes hath, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds it, the blessings wherewith I have blessed you since the building of the house: as if he said, Seeing you have despised me in your offerings, I will turn the blessing into a curse. And so <hi>Abarbinel,</hi> The meaning is, That, I will turn to you the blessing where- <note n="f" place="bottom">Hagg. II.18, 19.</note> blessed you, since the foundation of the Temple was laid, into a curse. And what this turning the blessing into a curse means, we may see by reading the XXVIII. Chapter of <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> here cited in the Margin of our Bibles, wherein are described the blessings for obedience, and curses for disobedience. Much like in meaning is what <hi>R. Salomon Jarchi</hi> saith, I will curse you in all which hath need that I should bless to you, your Corn, and Wine, and Oyl. Another learned <note n="g" place="bottom">
                     <hi>R.</hi> Tanch.</note> Jew gives an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, wherein he seems to comprehend, at least to point at, all these, thus explaining what is said, <hi>I will curse your blessings,</hi> that inasmuch as the Priests office was to pray or intercede for the People, and to teach them their duties, he threatens, seeing they despised his offerings, and neglected to direct the People to what was fit and right in that kind, that he would curse what they blessed, [or wherein they should be blessed] so as that the punishment should extend to all, in that there should fall a dearth or scarcity on their Corn and Cattel, and they should be straitned as concerning what they should offer to God; and the Priests dues should be few also.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yea I have cursed them already,</hi>] them, <hi>i. e.</hi> your blessings. The words thus read, shew that they should not deceive themselves in hope that the evill threatned should be delayed, or put off; but if that they would take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it, the curse was already gone forth against them, and had begun to seize on them, from the time that they began to despise his Name, and he saw that they did not lay it to heart to observe his Ordinances: so some of the <note n="h" place="bottom">Aben Ezra, Kimch. and Abarb.</note> Jews. And to this purpose <note n="i" place="bottom">Cal. Tarn.</note> divers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it. Others read it, yea I will also (or certainly, or farther) curse <hi>them,</hi> or <hi>it, i. e.</hi> the blessing, or every one of your blessings. [So they render it, because though the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Noun be plural, the affix is of the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular number and feminine gender, which way of construction is of constant use among the <hi>Arabians,</hi> and seems not to have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual to the Jews in those times.] So as that the repeating of the threat may add a confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to denote the certainty of it. And this reading divers <note n="k" place="bottom">Chald. Greek, Arab. Vulg. Lat. &amp; Arab. MS.</note> ancient Translations, and other <note n="l" place="bottom">R. Tanch. Ribera.</note> Expositors follow. <hi>R. Salomon Jarchi</hi> seems something more nicely to expound the words, while he observes, that the words at first put with a condition, <hi>If you will not hear, and if you will not lay it to heart, &amp;c. I will send a curse, &amp;c.</hi> and here repeated without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition intimate as much as if he should say, But there is no need of suspending the curse on that condition: for certainly you will not hear nor lay it to heart, and therefore from this time will I curse your blessings. The cause of this curse already gone forth, or certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly threatned to come, is because they do not lay to heart, what God hath spoken, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded concerning his service to observe to do accordindly: <note n="m" place="bottom">Calv.</note> such contempt of his word he will not bear.</p>

they are usually distinguished according to the difference of their sound, or form, according to the vowels, in signification also; or else that they read the word as to the vowels otherwise then it is now ordinarily, and with joint con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent read in the Hebrew Text. This difference is ancient, for the Chalde and Syriack (both ancient) take the same reading and significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that we now do.

This meaning is far from the former, and will scarce be made to accord with it: it may perhaps be easier reduced to that which the Greek hath, <hi>I separate to you the shoulder,</hi> although the Greek Father <hi>Cyrill</hi> otherwise expound that, saying, that <hi>I do separate,</hi> is to be understood, <hi>I have separated to you, (viz.</hi> allotted to you by the Law) that part, which custom I command again to be observed (saith he) as if they neglecting the former com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, not being content with that part, had taken of the flesh of the Sacrifice what liked them best. But what is there in the words, that may be a ground for this supposition, and supply of the sense? besides what warrant or example is there, for rendring the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>

See Nobil.</note> Translator render it according to the known signification, <hi>Behold I rebuke you with the arm.</hi> But in all these there is more of harsh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and difficulty then will easily be solved. If that make for liking the reading of <hi>shoulder,</hi> rather then <hi>seed,</hi> because another part of the Sacrifice allotted to the Priests is intimated, and joyned with it in the next words, (as hath been said.) The like reason will as much make for, and be appliable to the rendring it, <hi>seed,</hi> inasmuch as here is before made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Mincha,</hi> or <hi>meat offering,</hi> which was offered together with the Sacrifice, and was made of flower, and of which after a part burnt on the Altar, the remnant was the Priests: and besides that the first fruits of their Corn, Wine, and Oyl, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to give to the Priests as well as the shoulder, and two cheeks, and maw of the Sacrifice, <hi>Deut.</hi> XVIII.3, 4. and so the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting of the seed will be an evident cursing of their blessing, a punishment to them; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as by these means the People shall not have for the <note n="a" place="bottom">See Joel, I.13. and II.14.</note> 
                  <hi>Mincha,</hi> or meat offering, what to bring, nor plenty of first fruits for the Priests to receive. So that the corrupting of the seed <note n="b" place="bottom">Abarb.</note>, in respect to the <hi>Mincha,</hi> will have as good connexion (if it be to be stood on here) with what is said of the scattering on their faces the dung of their solemn Feasts, in respect to the Sacrifice, as the casting forth to them, or throwing at them the shoulder, (or what else they will have meant by that expression) by way of threat or denuntiation of a curse.</p>
               <p>All things therefore being considered, there seems no reason, why the ordinary reading in the Hebrew Text should be questioned, or not be preferred before any other, that can be pretended, and none therefore why we should not embrace our Translation, which is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to it.

Seeing therefore there is difference betwixt Expositors in their Interpretations, it will be convenient to see how the words barely and litterally found in the original Hebrew, as they lie, without any alteration, addition, or subtraction, that so we may better judge of those differences, and of the grounds of them. The words then thus found, <hi>My Covenant was with him life</hi> (or <hi>of life) and peace, and I gave them to him fear, and he feared me</hi>: which words, though when they were spoken, they were agreeable to the then common use of speaking, and doubtless well understood, yet will now scarce make a full and plain sense, put into another language, without something added or altered in them. For this reason there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Translators (and those who go the same way) add the word, <hi>for,</hi> (in <hi>for the fear</hi>) and change <hi>and</hi> for <hi>wherewith</hi> (in <hi>wherewith he feared me</hi>) which supply (as we said) by a man of great note is excepted against, as mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the sense. The meaning that he gives is this, <hi>My Covenant was with him of life and peace, and I gave to him fear, and he feared me.</hi> (And in this rendring concurs the ancient Latine Translation, and much like the Greek, <hi>and I gave to him to fear me with fear,</hi> which the printed Arabick, that followeth them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains, <hi>My Covenant was with him, to</hi> (or for) <hi>life and peace, and I gave him fear, that he might fear me.</hi>) And by fear <note n="p" place="bottom">Calv.</note> he understands a rule, according to which he should serve God, and by what is said, <hi>and he feared me,</hi> that he observed that rule, kept that Law, prescribed to him; (and in this some <note n="q" place="bottom">Grot.</note> others agree with him, and the Chalde seems to have lead them the way, who interprets, <hi>and I gave them the perfect</hi>

<q>I covenanted with them, to give to them as a reward of their obedience to me, life in this World, and security (or safety) from evils, or if you will say, happiness in this World, and happiness in the World to come, which is true peace: and <note n="t" place="bottom">See in Aben Ezra.</note> some say the meaning is, I have made a Covenant with them concerning (or with) such Precepts or Commands, by which they shall receive (or shall be received or obtained) life and peace.

But a learned Jew but even now cited, <hi>viz. R.

[Probably by the Penman of that Book set down, where it is as a story by it self, and not having dependance on others, that he might not interrupt the series and connexion of the History.] The same also he saies to be done in that story of the <hi>Danites,</hi> and <hi>Micah, Judg.</hi> XVIII. both he thinks to have been before that of <hi>Jephti</hi>; and that the like also may be observed in other places where the Penmen of the Books of Scripture, for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons best known to themselves, and to avoid interruption in what they were about, placed such things after others in their writing, which were done before them. The opinion likewise of others, who say that <hi>Phinehas</hi> lived yet longer, and was <hi>Eliah,</hi> he there confutes as very ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd. And in <note n="z" place="bottom">Ch. à Castro.</note> 
                  <hi>Aaron</hi> this may be said to be fulfilled, who lived an hundred and twenty and three years, <hi>Numb.</hi> XXXIII.39. But it will not concern our present purpose to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine such things; sufficient it will be to us from the present words, to be instructed that God did, to those comprehended under the name of <hi>Levi,</hi> as well as others, as <hi>Aaron, Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar,</hi> and <hi>Phinehas,</hi> make good on his part his Covenant to them of life and peace, and all conducible to their prosperity and happiness in the best manner, and still would to as many as should keep Covenant in fearing, reverencing, and obeying him, as those their Ancestors did.

by which they fondly expected to have him bound up to them, while they would wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly break it, and deal falsly in it towards him.</p>
               <p>A late very learned <note n="a" place="bottom">L. de Dieu.</note> man gives this exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the words, that whereas they literally are, <hi>My Covenant was with him of life and peace, and I gave them to him fear,</hi> &amp;c. the sense is to be made up, by supplying either, <hi>and,</hi> viz. <hi>And I gave them to him, and fear,</hi> or else <hi>with,</hi> viz. <hi>And I gave them to him with fear,</hi> that the sense may be, My Covenant was with him, or I made a Covenant with him of life and peace, And as I promised them by Covenant to him, so I gave them to him: nor gave I them alone to him, but also my fear, or them with my fear; and so follows, <hi>and he feared me</hi>: This he prefers before those rendrings above mentioned, either, <hi>and I gave them to him for a fear,</hi> or for <hi>the fear wherewith he feared me.</hi> Thus we having set down how the words simply run in the original, and most of what is said, and perhaps of what may well be said for exposition of them, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may judge what he thinks will best make for the meaning of them; he will find that which our Translators give, backed with the autority and consent of men of good judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and learning, and to give a plain and perspicuous meaning.</p>

In that they were all of one Religion, the People of one God, all acknowledging and professing to serve him alone, and to observe his Laws, <hi>hath not one God created us?</hi> and so in doing, as they did, contrary to his Law, profaned the Covenant of their Fathers, that Covenant by God, who made them his peculiar People, made with their Fathers; by vertue of which, <note n="s" place="bottom">Abarb. Deut. XXVI.17, 18.</note> as he was one God, so they were to be one People se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated to him, and not mingle themselves with the idolatrous Heathen, and particularly by making marriages with them, <hi>Deut.</hi> VII.3. That this meaning may be made plain, it will be convenient to observe somthing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning some of the words; as first, who is that one Father, which they all have. By him the <note n="t" place="bottom">Ab. Ezra. <hi>R</hi> Tanch. R. D. Kimchi. Abarb.</note> Jews understand to be particularly meant <hi>Jacob,</hi> the more immediate Father of the 12. Tribes, from whom they all sprung: and <note n="u" place="bottom">Cyrill, and most Christian Expositors.</note> others (many Christian Expositors) understand <hi>Abraham,</hi> from whom also they all came, with whom God first made that Covenant, by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of which, they, as his Seed, were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted his peculiar People, and heirs of the Promise. And of him that they were wont to boast as their Father, we learn in several pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages in the New Testament, as <hi>Joh.</hi> VIII.38, 39. and <note n="x" place="bottom">Mat. III.9. Luk. I.73.</note> else where. And <hi>Esa.</hi> LI.2. God bids them to look unto <hi>Abraham</hi> as their Father, whom he called [one, or] alone. So that in respect of either of these it may be said they had one Father. Nor will it make any difference as to what is thence urged or concluded here to them: it will be as to the purpose all one which of them be understood, as likewise if they should name also <hi>Isaac,</hi> who was between <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Jacob.</hi> 
                  <note n="y" place="bottom">Pisc. Diodate.</note> Others think by this one Father to be meant God, it following, <hi>hath not one God created us?</hi> and him may they truly so call; and we hear them say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the forecited <hi>Joh.</hi> VIII.41. <hi>We have one Father, even God.</hi> And thus taken, it would make for inferring the same conclusion of not dealing treacherously, nor violating the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant made with their Fathers; but as it is <note n="z" place="bottom">Calvin.</note> observed, would not bring it so close home, nor press it so far upon them, as if it be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of their one Father in the flesh, in whom they were by God received into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and made his peculiar People, distinct from other Nations; and ought therefore, by so preserving themselves without mixture with other profane People, to observe that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant without violation of it. If it should be understood of <hi>Adam,</hi> (as by <note n="a" place="bottom">Lyra vid. Ch. à Castro.</note> some it is) this way of arguing would be yet wider and looser, and not much to conclude against that which seems here in the first place more especially spoken against, <hi>viz.</hi> their taking Wives of other Nations, although against those things joyned with it, <hi>viz.</hi> their putting away the Israeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish Wives which they had, or taking more strange Wives with them; it so would firmly conclude according to our Saviors way of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing, <hi>Mat.</hi> XIX.4, 5, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet seems it most agreeable to the argument of this place, to understand either <hi>Abraham</hi> or <hi>Jacob.</hi>

                  <hi>Hath not one God created us?</hi>] It seems not ill observed by <note n="b" place="bottom">Ch. à Castro.

In which sense it is likewise used, <hi>Isa.</hi> XLIII.1. <hi>The Lord that created thee, O Jacob,</hi> and so v. 7. And in the new Testament in much like use, <hi>Eph.</hi> II.10. <hi>We are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works: for if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature,</hi> II <hi>Cor.</hi> V.17.

of us, and of all things, and profess to serve him alone, contrary to other Nations, who do not so acknowledge him, but serve false Gods? and how then should we all, agreeing in the true Religion, and by it distinguished from others, violate those respects and duties which that Religion binds us to observe one towards another, as brethren and partakers of the same Covenant, which by dealing treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously or falsely one with another, we do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane.</p>

                  <hi>Every one against his brother.</hi>] The matter according to the exposition we are speaking of, rather <note n="d" place="bottom">Ab. Ezra.

The word, <hi>brother,</hi> may therefore be taken, either so as to include the relation of kindred and family, (which was <note n="e" place="bottom">See Montan. Chr. à Castro, &amp; Hierom.</note> accounted brotherhood) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther males or females, sisters as well as bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: his wife is meant, (saith <hi>Abarbinel</hi>) as if it sounded, <hi>a man against his wife,</hi> 
                  <note n="f" place="bottom">Munst.</note> or else while they so wronged their Wives, they wronged those whose daughters or sisters they wronged, and dealt treacherously with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Why do we every man?</hi> This intimates, that the fault spoken of, was very common among them, many guilty of it; yet not so, that we may think every one was guilty in that kind, nor the Prophet himself among them: though to shew how he, and all the rest that were members of the same body and community, were concerned in those sins which were by many among them committed, he speaks in general, and seems to include all, even him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self too. <hi>We every man.</hi> There is nothing in the original that expresly denotes <hi>every,</hi> but inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitly a man against his brother, or one against another.

               <p>The sin wherein they dealt treacherously, and by it profaned the Covenant of their Fathers, though not particularly expressed in this verse, yet is in the next verse set down in express terms, so as to favor the last Exposition.</p>

But among all, none seems more genuin then that given in the Text of our English Bible, so understood as we have said, in that so it is opposed to what follows, vers. 16. where he saith, <hi>The Lord hateth putting away,</hi> and that any should take other illegal wives to his law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full wife, according to that Exposition which there some follow, those things are contrary to that holiness here spoke of; as those he hates, so this he loves and requires.</p>

Such who should watch for (or over) them in (or with) praiers and admonitions. 2. Such as should answer them, when they should ask concerning the Law. 3.

This would be no ill meaning: but the first mentioned is more approved and followed, as best agreeing with what follows. [Nor is that way followed which <hi>Cyril</hi> mentions, as if by <hi>the tears,</hi> &amp;c. were understood such as were drawn from the covetous offerers, <note n="d" place="bottom">Ch.

This seems a plain Exposition of the words, and in which will be included or ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily reduced to it what is by others said; as what <hi>Kimchi</hi> saith, that by, <hi>because the Lord hath been witness between thee,</hi> &amp;c. is meant, that whatever they pretend, God seeth, and is witness, that they did not love their wives; their heart was not towards them, but they dealt treacherously with them, and so gave them just cause of complaining to the Lord: as likewise what <hi>Abarbinel</hi> saith, who makes the import of the question, <hi>wherefore</hi>? which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently standing on their own justification they asked, to be, wherefore do those wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men weep and complain? as if they knew no cause they had: and then explains the answer much according to what was at first said, that it was because God was witness to those rites and instruments of matrimonial contract and covenants made between them, which the women having kept unviolated on their parts, and behaved themselves as faithfull compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and covenanted wives to them, when they saw them violated by their husbands taking other wives with them, did address themselves to the Lord their witness, and complained of the wrong done to them: By which moved, he shews himself justly displeased for such their treacherous dealing.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Gods being witness,</hi> 
                  <note n="i" place="bottom">See Ribera, Ch. à Castro, &amp;c.</note> some understand his precept or command for keeping Covenants inviolable betwixt man and wife, according to the first institution of marriage, <hi>Gen.</hi> II.24. By <hi>wife of youth,</hi>

[<hi>Kimchi</hi> observes that by these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions is denoted the dereliction of any Israelitish wife legally married, whether in youth or age, inasmuch as the notion of <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion</hi> and <hi>wife of Covenant</hi> agrees to either.]</p>

It appears so by the several dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Expositions that are given of it. We shall in the first place take notice of that which seems most agreeable to our Translation in the Text. <hi>And did not he,</hi> i. e. that one God who created all, <hi>vers.</hi> 10. <hi>make one? i. e.</hi> one man, and one woman, made out of the rib of that one man, one only pair; so that that one man had only one wife, though <hi>he had the residue of the spirit,</hi> 
                  <note n="n" place="bottom">Buxtorf. Vindic p. 568.</note> being the Father of spirits, and so could have at his pleasure created more spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits or souls, and infused them into more wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, so that that one man might have had more wives if God had so pleased. But now he gave him only one, and made only one couple, and that for this end, that they might in chast wedlock and sincere love, and undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided affection, propagate a godly seed or holy seed to God: whose example, therefore, ye ought to look on as a perpetual Law set to you: and therefore in imitation of that first man, <hi>take heed</hi> you also every one <hi>to your spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>; that spirit by God infused into you, that ye impart and communicate it only to one, and that with sincere affection, <hi>and let none</hi> of you <hi>deal treacherously against the wife of his youth,</hi> by despising or relinquishing her, or taking any other strange wife with her. This seems an easy and very probable Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the rendring is agreeable to the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:33128:21"/>
words, without force or violence to any of them, or to the construction. And it will be confirmed by our Savior's way of arguing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst divorce, (and consequently Polygamy,) <hi>Matt.</hi> XIX.4, 5, 6. <hi>Have ye not read that he which made them at the beginning, made them male and female,</hi> &amp;c. by which is well expounded this expression here, <hi>did not he make one</hi>? that is one couple, which by that relation, as he there adds, became one flesh, and are no more two but one flesh, one man, as (<hi>Gen.</hi> I.27.) they both together are called, and therefore should be of one mind and one spirit also, the unity of which they ought faithfully to preserve, without dealing treacherously one with the other, to the making a division betwixt them, or by taking in strangers to corrupt that holy Seed by God required, and introduce a spu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious unsanctified generation, like that by such means brought in, <hi>Gen.</hi> VI.2, &amp;c. But though this seem a plain and good Exposition, yet because far different ones are by others given, it will be convenient to take notice of some of them at least, lest we should be thought to take this because others were not considered.</p>
               <p>In the next place, therefore, we may take notice of that reading, which the ancient La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Translation gives, <hi>Nonne unus fecit, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siduam spiritûs ejus est,</hi> &amp;c. which, according to the <hi>Doway</hi> English Version of it, is, <hi>did not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

And what in that doth he look after? he seeks a Seed of God, a divine or godly Seed, of which he may be called the Author and Father. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take heed to your spirit that you offend not against him, (with whom is abundance of the spirit, and who by that abundance most wisely ordered Matrimony,) by dealing trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherously with or against your lawful wives.

Another sense he also mentions, <hi>viz.</hi> For he made not one alone, and abundance of the spirit is with him: and why, or to what purpose, should he have made one seeking a Seed of God? <hi>Take heed therefore,</hi> &amp;c. the sense is; God would that the woman should be a companion to the man, and his confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; for he made not only man, not a male alone, but a woman also, and that most wisely, inasmuch as he hath the remainder of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and to what purpose should he do it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:33128:21"/>

               <p>Having seen this variety of Expositions, (besides what we shall after see) among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Interpreters, if we shall look into the Jews, we shall find yet more, they almost all differing one from another. The Chalde Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrast, the ancientest among them, thus para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraseth the words:
<q>Was not <hi>Abraham</hi> one alone, from whom was created (or procreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) the World, or a World?</q>
(It may be supposed he respects the blessings promised to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that from him should be a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Nations, and in his Seed all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of the Earth should be blessed, <hi>Gen.</hi> XII.3. and XVII.4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and XXII.17. or, that by the <hi>World</hi> he understands the People of <hi>Israel,</hi> God's peculiar in the World, <hi>Gen.</hi> XXXII.8, 9.)
<q>and what did that one seek, but that there might remain to him an off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring from before God, or in the sight of God: Take heed therefore to your selves, and deal not falsely with the wife of thy youth.</q>
                  <hi>R Salomo Jarchi,</hi> though after him many ages, yet the eldest Commentator, gives an Exposition to this purpose, according to his own words, <note n="z" place="bottom">See Buxtorf. Vindic. p. 568.</note> and as by <hi>Abarbinel</hi> explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<q>Did not God make one, <hi>i. e.</hi> one pair, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> and not one man with two women? and the residue of the spirit was to him, or was his, <hi>i. e,</hi> to, or in, <hi>Adam</hi> the first man: the rest of the spirits of men were in him, from him they all proceeded. And if so, why doth one, who is in marriage, seek to find occasions against his wife, which is coupled to him, and which is the Seed of God? why doth he prosecute her so as to despise her?</q>
This is his chief, or only Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, according to what is in the printed Copies, and what is reported from him by <hi>Abarbinel.</hi> But in a Manuscript Copy there is before this put another Exposition different from it, <hi>viz.</hi> to this sense,
<q>Did not the holy God prepare a help for <hi>Adam</hi> (or man) and joyn to him his wife at the beginning? and the remainder of the spirit was to him; (or, his spirit remained unto him) but now an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other <note n="a" place="bottom">See Num. 5.14, and 30. and ch. 14.24.</note> spirit is come upon him to hate her, and he hath chosen to him the daughter of a strange God: and why one? he seeketh, (or what doth that one seek?) a daughter of <hi>Israel,</hi> which is the Seed of holiness.</q>
This I must desire the Reader to examine by some other manuscript Copy, if he meet with any; and for that end I have put the Hebrew words, as they are in that Copy which I had use of. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </p>
               <p>Another Exposition he likewise mentions out of the ancient Rabbins, in which the words are made, as it were, a Dialogue betwixt the People and the Prophet; as if those that had married strange wives, coming together to the Prophet, said, did not <hi>Abraham</hi> do so, who took to him <hi>Hagar</hi> with his wife? and he answered,
<q>But the residue of the spirit (or excellency of spirit) was with him; his meaning was not as yours; he set not his eies upon her; he had another meaning. They said to him, and what did that one seek, what was his meaning? he saith to them, That he might have a Seed of God.</q>
Another also in the manuscript Copy to this purpose, as if the People did object,
<q>Did not one make us? did not he that created <hi>Israel,</hi> create the Nations also? why doth he make it unlawful for us to joyn in marriage with them? are not also all the rest of the spirits his? the Prophet did answer, And what doth that one require? a Seed of God. Take heed, therefore, unto your spirit, and let not thy spirit deal falsely with the wife of thy youth.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The last but one of these is plainly the same with what <hi>David Kimchi</hi> gives, as his Fathers opinion, (without mentioning either <hi>R. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomo,</hi> or any other from whom he took it,) only a little more explained, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <q>That the first are the words of the People to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, Did not <hi>Abraham,</hi> our Father, who was one, do so as we do, who let alone his wife, and married <hi>Hagar</hi> his Maid, although there was in him excellency of spirit, and he was a Prophet?</q>
then the Prophet's answer in the next words,
<q>What did that one seek? a Seed of God: as if he should say, When he married <hi>Hagar,</hi> he did it not but to seek a Seed of God, because he had no Seed by <hi>Sarah</hi> his wife, <note n="b" place="bottom">See Kimchi on vers. 10.</note> and withall he did not deal falsely with his wife, because by her good will, and her command, he did it. But do you take heed to your spirit, and let not any of you deal treacherously with the wife of his youth, to leave her and marry the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a strange God.</q>
That which he gives as his own interpretation is,
<q>
                     <hi>Abraham,</hi> who was one, and the Father to all that come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, in his Faith, did not so as ye do: for he followed not his lust, neither married any <note n="c" place="bottom">So a MS.</note> that was lawful to him, (<note n="d" place="bottom">Buxt.

                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:33128:22"/>
no not of his <note n="e" place="bottom">As other Editions.</note> own flesh, or kindred;) but that he might leave a Seed of God, as he commanded to leave Seed, saying, <hi>Increase and multiply, Gen.</hi> I.28.</q>
And by the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Shear,</hi> he saies is understood <hi>excellency,</hi> not as in other Expositions, <hi>residue of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> [To this opinion, of making <hi>Abraham</hi> the <hi>One</hi> here spoken of, several <note n="f" place="bottom">See Calvin, Drus. Vatab. Paraeus, Stokes, &amp;c.</note> Christians also incline: and amongst them <hi>Grotius,</hi> who yet in the expounding the other words differs from them, by the words which they take to signify <hi>excellency of spirit,</hi> he taking to be signified, that they, the Israelites, were the residue of his spirit, <hi>i. e.</hi> all drew and derived their spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit from his: and then what is rendered, <hi>Take heed to your spirit,</hi> understands, restrain or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain your Anger.] The changings of persons and numbers here in the Hebrew, (as, <hi>Take ye heed to your spirits,</hi> in the plural number and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond person, then <hi>the wife of thy youth</hi> in the singular, then <hi>let him not deal treacherously</hi> in the third person, without expressing who is meant, whereas it might seem more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to what precedes to say, <hi>do not ye</hi> or <hi>thou,</hi> which some supply by putting in <hi>any,</hi> let not any, or let none deal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 
                  <note n="g" place="bottom">So R. Salomo, and Ab.

               <p>
                  <hi>Abarbinel</hi> having considered and recited <hi>Kimchi</hi>'s Exposition, as likewise shewed how the opinion of those, who understand that <hi>One</hi> of <hi>Adam,</hi> is, as he supposes, to be managed most agreeably to the scope of the words, (<hi>viz.</hi> that the first words be taken as an objection to the Prophet that reproved them for their taking strange wives;
<q>We are all the children of the first man <hi>Adam,</hi> children of one Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and then none can be accounted a strange woman; which is that which is said, <hi>did not one, i. e.</hi> the holy God at first create one man alone? and the residue of the spirit was with him, <hi>i. e.</hi> the rest of the spirits came forth of his loins, <hi>viz.</hi> of that first <hi>Adam,</hi> who was one: and then that the other words be the Prophets answer; to this purpose: Will you make your condition to be equal, or like that of the first man <hi>Adam,</hi> when he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in the World? for he did not seek ought but a Seed of God, children that should serve God; not following after his concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence as ye do, and therefore it is meet that ye <hi>Take heed to your spirits,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
which Exposition, how clear it is, I will not examine:) yet seeing that neither <hi>Adam</hi> nor <hi>Abraham</hi> are mentioned in the Text, thinks the words are capable of another more simple Exposition, which he thus gives, <hi>And not one hath done it,</hi> viz. <hi>not one only among you hath committed this evil.</hi> So that you may say, <hi>shall one man sin, and wilt thou be wrath with all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation</hi>? (as <hi>Num.</hi> XVI.22.) One man alone among you hath not done this; so as that to the rest, their spirit is with them, <hi>i. e.</hi> they keep en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire their soul and spirit, which shall return unto God who gave it. And if it were but one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone among you, I would ask him what he did seek by this marriage? whether he did seek that the children, which were born unto him should be a Seed of God? this is not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible as long as their mother is the daughter of a strange God. And seeing the matter is so, that ye have all transgressed, not one only of you, and seeing that he that so transgresseth in this, knows of a truth, that his Seed will not be the Seed of God, it concerns you, that ye take heed to your spirit, (for there is nothing more precious to a man then his soul) and that you keep your spirit, that it break not forth after its lusts, and then it will not, (or let it not, <hi>viz.</hi> that spirit) <hi>deal treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously with the wife of thy youth; Because,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This is a literal Interpretation of his words: and this his opinion a learned <note n="h" place="bottom">Arias Montanus.</note> Christian em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth; but a modern <note n="i" place="bottom">Aben Dana in Miclal Yophi, on the place.</note> Jew who cites it, having considered it, prefers another of his own, wherein he takes by the <hi>One</hi> to be meant <hi>Israel,</hi> whom God chose to be to himself <hi>One</hi> peculiar People among all Nations, a People that should dwell alone, and not be reckoned among the Nations, (as <hi>Balaam</hi> speaks of them, <hi>Num.</hi> XXIII.9.) and were therefore to preserve themselves a holy People, and to keep their Genealogy and offspring entire, not mingled with other Nations, nor making mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages with them, whereby the holy Seed, the Seed of God might be mingled with the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a strange God. So that the Prophets re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof here will run thus, Did not God make <hi>Israel</hi> one Nation in the Earth, and to him was excellency of spirit, <hi>i. e.</hi> did not God give to <hi>Israel,</hi> that <hi>one</hi> Nation, an excellent spirit above all Nations? and what is it that that <hi>one</hi> seeks, or should seek? It is a Seed of God, a Seed that God hath blessed to take (or in taking) a wife of the daughters of <hi>Israel,</hi> who are the Seed of God, children of the living God; and not the daughter of a strange God, <hi>Therefore take heed to your spirit,</hi> lest there be made a breach in that high degree and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency which God hath imparted to you, in making you <hi>one</hi> holy People, separate from all other People. And this Exposition he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, by looking back to the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verses, <hi>Have we not all one Father,</hi> &amp;c. which he will have to import, That God our God is one, and he is our Father, who created us
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:33128:22"/>
to be to him a peculiar People, <hi>one</hi> People of <hi>one</hi> God, and if we take strange wives of the Nations of the Earth, we shall deal trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherously every one against his brother, and profane the holy Covenant of our Fathers, our Seed, which is the holiness of the Lord, which he loveth.</p>
               <p>There are yet other Expositions ancienter then some of the forementioned, which yet because the <note n="k" place="bottom">R. Tanchum.</note> Author, from whom I take them, is not yet printed, as the others are, and in some consideration to the Expositions them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, I put in the last place. He tells us that the meaning of the words is said (by more perhaps, because he names no particular, though the words in which he gives it, are expresly <hi>Aben Ezra</hi>'s;) to be,
<q>That there is not any among you but hath done this, that the construction of the words, with a supply of what is to be understood, may run thus, There is not one of you that hath done, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Cedat,</hi> according to the Law, and his spirit (or whose spirit) remains to him, so as that it hath not been mingled with the daughter of a strange God.</q>
This Exposition, though he approve not of, yet it may be observable in regard that it agrees with the usual reading of the LXX, or Greek Version, which hath <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which being read without an Interrogation, though it is usually read with one, would sound, <hi>And he hath not done</hi> that which is <hi>good, and</hi> there is <hi>remainder of his spirit</hi>: where by <hi>he</hi> (seeing it is to be asked who is meant by it) it will be the readiest and plainest way to understand <hi>any one,</hi> that by <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>he hath not done,</hi> may be meant the same as by <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>good</hi>: and if so, all that I shall at present say is, That then this Interpretation is not novel, and withal, that perhaps there is no reason why <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>not good,</hi> should be changed into <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>This Exposition <hi>R. Tanchum</hi> having cited, rejects, for this reason, because that fault was not so general, as that all may be said to be guilty of it, but only some particular persons, who are reckoned up in <hi>Esdras,</hi> ch. X.18, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Nehem.</hi> XIII.28. except they may therefore be all accounted guilty, because they did not disapprove it. Another Exposition; therefore, he gives of his own, <hi>viz. And there is not one who hath done this, and hath his spirit remaining to him, i. e.</hi> but shall certainly perish in his sin. Then he asks, as by way of derision, and what is the end or purpose of any one in doing this? doth he thereby seek a holy Seed that shall set it self to obey God therefore it behoveth you to look to your selves, as you would save <note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>There being this variety of Expositions ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcilable between themselves, I knew not how better to make way for the Reader to examine them, and judge of them, and so to enquire after the truth, then by thus giving him the chief of them at large: and for more facilitating yet the matter, it may not be amiss to give the bare signification of the words, which are so diversly expounded, as they stand in the original Text, which are <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>And first as to the Jews, by <note n="y" place="bottom">R. D. Kimchi, R.

                     </gap>b.</note> others of them, is a manifest injury co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering his garment, openly conspicuous, for all his pretence of doing her right in retaining her. Their words in expressing their meaning, as a learned <note n="a" place="bottom">Pet. Fig.</note> man observes of some of them, are short and obscure: that which they aim at is manifestly this, That if they hated their wives, they ought to put them away by legal divorce; their not doing so, but retaining them, though in their hearts hated by them, and taking in with them other strange wives, whom they more loved, was a great injury, a violence done to them and to God's Law, whether it be interpreted a violence covered with their garment, <hi>i. e.</hi> with a pretence; or violence covering their garment and manifest to all. Then, according to that Interpretation, which as we have seen, the Chalde and others follow, <hi>viz. If he hate her, let him put her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> these will thus follow; For will he (or can he) cover his iniquity in taking an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other strange wife, by his retaining still his former Israelitish wife? <hi>i. e.</hi> let him not deal falsely with her, and think it enough thus to cover his inward hatred of her, by making a shew of respect by retaining her, whereas his taking a strange wife with her, argues that in his heart he hates her; or according to <note n="b" place="bottom">Aba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>b.</note> others, it is a violence or injury that will not be hid, but appear to all, as any thing that is above his garment. Is it at all meet, saith <hi>R.

               <p>In a Manuscript Copy of the same <hi>R. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomo</hi> we have another Exposition, which in the ordinary printed Copies we find not, <hi>viz. That he that putteth away his wife, draweth a cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of violence over his other garments to himself</hi>; agreeable to that expression, <hi>Hab.</hi> II.17. <hi>The violence of Lebanon shall cover thee</hi>: the end will be, that the violence done to her shall be revenged on him; his meaning seems to be, he makes himself guilty of violence, which God will revenge. But this is to be applied to that other rendring of the preceding words, <hi>viz. he hateth putting away,</hi> which (as we have seen) others of the Jews also follow, who yet as concerning these words, scarce give us e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, whereby to discern what they thought of the meaning of them, as particularly <hi>R. Aben Ezra,</hi> who hath no more then only these words, <hi>He hateth him that putteth away his wife that is clean, and he hateth him that covereth,</hi> or <hi>God seeth his violence,</hi> or injuriousness, <hi>which is in secret.</hi> By which words all that we can see of his meaning is, that by covering vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence with his garment, is meant harboring in secret hatred of his wife, which God seeth under what pretence soever covered, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it. <hi>R. Tanchum</hi> also having declared for the meaning of the words, what we have seen, as appliable to the other rendring of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer words, doth not add any other as parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly appliable to this rendring, except out of his explaining them thus,
<q>That he hateth
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:33128:24"/>
putting away, or divorce, in this kind, that a daughter of <hi>Israel</hi> should be put away for the daughter of a strangers sake, <hi>i. e.</hi> that he may take in her room a strange heathenish wife;</q> we may pick out this meaning, that the putting away an Israelitish wife for that reason is called <hi>a covering violence with his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> All therefore that I can say is that the Jewish Expositors in giving the meaning of these words, are (as we said) somwhat per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex and obscure. Let us see if the Christians speak more plainly.</p>
               <p>They that render as ours in the Text, or to that purpose, <hi>for the Lord saith he hateth put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting away; for one</hi> (or <hi>and,</hi> or <hi>but he) covereth violence with his garment,</hi> must make this the meaning, that what he doth is hateful, though he hath for a covering or pretence, that the <note n="c" place="bottom">Deut. XXIV.1. &amp;c.</note> Law permitted to put away his wife, whom he did not like. For though God, to prevent greater mischief of cruelty and Polygamy, did permit, or rather leave unpunished by the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick Magistrate the doing so, <note n="d" place="bottom">See Jun. Trem. Pisc. Bishop Hall.</note> yet for all that, it was still hateful in his eies, really vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and iniquity, however, he might cover it with that cloak of permission in the Law. And so if it be read (as in our Margin) <hi>if he hate her, put her away,</hi> to the same meaning follows, <note n="e" place="bottom">Dutch Notes, Diodate.</note> yet the use of this permission is only a covering of violence with a politick co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verture; and not a thing pleasing to God. Or <note n="f" place="bottom">Brennius.</note> as others, and <hi>let him cover violence with his garment, i. e.</hi> with a bill of divorce, which is likened to a garment, because as a garment defends the body from the injury of weather, and covers the shame; so that served to defend her, that was put away, from that cruelty, or hard usage which she should find, if retained; and from that contumely and disgrace, which she would otherwise be obnoxious too: and therefore <note n="g" place="bottom">Vatab.</note> some look on the putting their wives away, without that covering of a bill of divorce, as the violence or injury here meant.</p>
               <p>From what hath been said will easily result what <hi>Calvin</hi> takes to be the import of these words, <hi>That God doth not in them shew any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of divorce, yet that seeing he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nived at it in his Law,</hi> 
                  <note n="h" place="bottom">And see Drus. in marg.</note> 
                  <hi>it would be a less fault then the taking in strange illegal idolatrous wives with their lawful Israelitish wives.</hi> And the same meaning <note n="i" place="bottom">Oecolamp.</note> they seem to aim at, who by <hi>vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> understand the Israelitish wife retained for a cover, though hated and abused, and having another taken in above her, though <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> thinks that a very forced Interpretation. To these may be added, because they follow the same order in construction of the words, such who yet give a far different meaning of the phrase, by taking the Preposition <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Al</hi> in its most usual signification for <hi>upon</hi> or <hi>above,</hi> and so render the words as a <note n="k" place="bottom">Pet. à Fig.</note> proverbial Speech, and <hi>he hideth violence upon his garment, i. e.</hi> though he pretend the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But this will be much the same meaning which they give, who clean differently order the words in the construction, which, as we have seen, the vulgar Latin and others do, rendring, <hi>but violence shall cover his garment, i. e.</hi> 
                  <note n="l" place="bottom">Menoch. Chr. à Castro's Paraph.</note> for all his bill of divorce, it is still open violence and an injury, which will not, or cannot be concealed: or, taking with <note n="m" place="bottom">Riber.</note> others <hi>violence</hi> or <hi>iniquity</hi> for the punishment of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; for all that, the punishment of his vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence or injury done to his wife, shall be made conspicuous to all, <note n="n" place="bottom">Tirin.</note> both the fault and the punishment shall cover (or be overspread over) his garment, and his body too (as <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> by the garment understands the body, which is as the garment of the soul;) and make him infamous to all. <note n="o" place="bottom">See Chr. à Castro.</note> Others, the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of his wife (made known by his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorcing her) shall cover his garment, defend him from that infamy which his wife did as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perse him with.</p>
               <p>This Exposition seems not much to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; as neither that of <note n="p" place="bottom">Ibid.</note> theirs, who would have it, <hi>If he hate her, put her away, saith the Lord, who covereth violence as with his garment, by permitting to put her away with a bill of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce. Lud. de Dieu,</hi> having considered these words, and asserted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this construction of them, <hi>and violence</hi> (or wrong) <hi>covereth</hi> (or hath covered) <hi>his garment,</hi> giveth as his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion for the meaning of them,
<q>That God here reproveth them, for that, whereas they with their garment ought to have covered their wives; violence or wrong did cover their garment, whilst they did treacherously hate their wives, and put away those whom they hated, that they might marry strange wives: or else, that by these words, <hi>violence covereth his garment,</hi> is denoted the filthiness of adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, wherewith he was wholly covered, according as the garment spotted by the flesh is taken, <hi>Jude</hi> vers. 23.</q>
To which his meaning he maketh way, by observing, That in matters concerning wedlock, the name of <hi>garment</hi> is used for fidelity and conjugal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, as <hi>Ezek.</hi> XVI.8. <hi>I spread my skirt over thee,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Ruth</hi> III.9. <hi>Spread thy skirt over thy handmaid:</hi> and so concerning the use of the marriage bed, is used the expression, <hi>To discover the skirt of the garment, Deut.</hi> XXII.30.</p>
               <p>In all this variety presented to the Readers view, he may judge what meaning will best
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:33128:24"/>
satisfy him, and seem to give the fullest sense of the words. For my part I must profess my self not fully satisfied with any of them, and am of opinion, that by this figurative and perhaps proverbial expression, (which then when ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered was well understood, though not so at this distance of time) was somthing meant, which none of our Expositors give: concerning which though I have nothing confidently to affirm, yet I shall make bold to propose a conjecture, which I suppose will, as concerning the use of the words, be easily made probable. The conjecture is this, that by the words, taking that construction of them which we have seen, <hi>Abraham Aben Ezra,</hi> and <hi>Rabbi Tanchum</hi> to afford, and which seems to be among all that are given the plainest, <hi>viz, He hateth putting away, and</hi> he hateth <hi>to cover</hi> (or rather <hi>to put,</hi> or that one should put as a covering, or su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perinduce) <hi>violence over his garment</hi>; is meant the superinducing or marrying an illegitimate wife, over (or with, or above) his legitimate first wife. So that by <hi>violence</hi> may be signified a second wife, with wrong to the former taken in with her, and by <hi>his garment,</hi> his former wife lawfully taken. For making which use of the words probable, to begin first with the last word, we may observe, besides what hath been already mentioned of the use, if not of the very word, yet of another of like signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in matter of wedlock, that which (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the simplest exposition of the words) is by <hi>Abimelech</hi> said, <hi>Gen.</hi> XX.16. That <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was to <hi>Sarah</hi> his wife <hi>a covering of the eies, i. e.</hi> saith the Chalde, a covering of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor. And by like reason that the husband may be said to be to the wife <hi>a covering of the eies,</hi> to keep her from looking after others, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from looking after her, may the wife be said, to be to the husband <hi>a covering of the eies,</hi> to keep him from looking after any wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man but her. If this be not enough to prove such accommodation to man and wife of words signifying <hi>covering</hi> or <hi>garment,</hi> in the language of those times; yet if one Eastern language may serve for illustrating and giving testimony to the expressions of another of so nigh affinity to it, that they may be accounted almost one, and one but a dialect of the other, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabick is to the Hebrew, so esteemed by the Jewish Writers, and therefore usually had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to for finding out the use and significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Hebrew words, where any doubt or difficulty occurs; then here will the Arabick Tongue help us, and teach us to pronounce boldly of such words, as signify a <hi>garment</hi> or <hi>covering,</hi> that they are applied to signify <hi>man</hi> or <hi>wife</hi> respectively. So saith a learned <note n="q" place="bottom">Ebn Athir in his Dictionary.</note> Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marian, that <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>The same meaning will be easily applied to such other rendrings, as are given and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by the scope of the place, as coming fully home to it, which, from the 10t<hi rend="sup">h</hi> verse to these inclusively, is a reproof of the Jews of that time, for their injury done to their lawfull Israelitish wives, by either illegally putting them away, that they might take the daughters of a strange God; or else if they did retain them, yet secretly hating them, and taking in above them such strange idolatrous wives, whom, with manifest injury to their former, they did shew more affection to, and make, as it were, Mistresses over them.

                  <hi>Ye have wearied the Lord with your words,</hi> &amp;c.] A Jewish <note n="y" place="bottom">Ab.

Or as <hi>Abarbinel</hi> makes the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition from the former words to these, that, after he had reproved them for their evil deeds, both Priests and People, he here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to reprove them for their words and thoughts, which were even worse and more wicked then their deeds; in that the wicked ones of that generation did return in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the reproofs of the Prophet, <hi>There is neither judgement nor Judge, God hath left the Earth.</hi> His reproof of them, therefore, for this he gives, saying, <hi>Ye have wearied the Lord with your words.</hi> Here is by several of the <note n="b" place="bottom">Ab. Ezra, and R. D. Kimchi.</note> Jews noted (as well as by others) that this is spoken figuratively according to the language of men, or in such as is pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable among men, but cannot be properly, said of God, who cannot be <hi>wearied.</hi> It denotes that their words were such as would weary any man in autority, and provoke him to anger, and so did provoke God to deal so with them, as that by the effects they might judge him to be weary of hearing from them such words, and could no longer endure them: which is that which the Greek expresses by rendring it, <hi>who have provoked the Lord to wrath. Rabbi Tanchum</hi> thus expounds it, Ye have caused a restraint of his (care and) provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or caused him to withhold his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence from ordering your affairs, by doing such things as he cannot bear, according to what is said, <hi>I cannot away with it,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Isa.</hi> I.13. and again, <hi>I am weary to bear them, v.</hi> 14. <hi>Abarbinel</hi> thinks there is no necessity of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any <note n="c" place="bottom">Mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

was wearied by their words, but that they in saying what they did, did ascribe to him wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riness and impotency, and defect in his power and providence: for if he did not know what wicked men did, or did not regard it, or would not, or could not hinder or punish it, this would argue him weary, impotent, and deficient. Which of the two waies of expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this word we take, will not be much ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, nor make any difference in the sense or coherence with the following words. But there is no reason to depart from the first and more followed way.</p>
               <p>The Prophet thus reproving them as faulty in this kind, they are represented, as impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently denying themselves so to be, or to have spoken any words, that should be so offensive, <hi>Yet ye say, wherein have we wearied him</hi>? (or according to the other way, whereby have we attributed to him weariness or impotency?) Or if we interpret the words as others to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a supposition of what he knowing their evil thoughts, saw they would be apt to say, If ye shall say, <hi>Wherein,</hi> &amp;c. He gives them an answer in which he declares what it was they said, or thought to the affronting of God, and highly provoking him, <hi>when ye say, Every one that doth evil is good in the sight of the Lord, and he delighteth in them, or, where is the God of Judgement</hi>? It is easily supposed, though not exprest, that they, seeing the prosperous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of some openly wicked men, not only of the idolatrous Nations, as <note n="d" place="bottom">Hieron.</note> some would have it, but among themselves also, they being <note n="e" place="bottom">Grot.</note> preferred in dignity above others, and flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing more then themselves, who in their own conceits, were much better deserving; took thence occasion of uttering these blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous words, <note n="f" place="bottom">R. Tanchum.</note> contrary to what the Prophets affirmed concerning God's Justice and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on sinners, thus retorting, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting them,
<q>It is not certainly, as you say, but on the contrary, such as do evil are <hi>good in the sight of the Lord, and he delighteth in them,</hi> it so appears by their prospering; and where then is the judgement of that just Judge, that you tell us of? which yet <hi>R. Tanchum</hi> thinks not to imply that they ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly denied the being of such a Judge, (for then it would not have been added, <hi>And where is,</hi> &amp;c.) but spoke by way of contradiction to what they heard from the Prophets, as a proof of God's slow proceeding in his order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and disposing of things.

By others, he saith, the meaning is thus given, as if they did say, thus or thus; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>every one that doth evil is good in the sight of God, and he delighteth in them</hi>; at other times, <hi>where is the God of Judgement?</hi> and by others, <hi>If it be not so as we say, where then is the God of Judgment</hi>? In these waies of exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by him given, is comprehended most of what is said by other Expositors ancient and modern, they following the same way in construction of the words. But a late learned <note n="g" place="bottom">Lud. de Dieu.</note> man thinketh it more convenient and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the nice rules of Grammar, to render the former words, <hi>when ye say every one that</hi>

But this doth not make much difference, as to the scope or intent of what blasphemy they are charged with: <hi>viz.</hi> that they should make God a favorer of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked persons.

But though in his Notes on <hi>Isa.</hi> XXVII.4. he make it probable that this particle may sometimes so signify, yet whether it ought here so to be used (especially, making, as he doth, the following words, <hi>where is the God of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi> to be the Prophets words) may seem questionable, inasmuch as then the Prophet would seem guilty in the same kind that those whom he reproves were; <hi>viz.</hi> in questioning Gods justice, as shewing favor to wicked men, they did it because God seemed in their eies to favor others more wicked than themselves, more than he did them; he should do but much the same, because God so much favored, or bare with them. But if any will have it so rendred, I should rather think the following words should still be the words of those wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, as others take them to be; and then the sense will be but the same, as if it were rendred <hi>or,</hi> or <hi>and,</hi> only with a little more ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemency; and either a denying or complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the slowness of Gods Justice: They thus (probably, as we said, in defence of their own obstinacy in persevering in those evil waies, for which the Prophets reproved them,) <note n="k" place="bottom">Tarnov.</note> arguing,
<q>What need we fear, though we go on in such courses, as you reprove us for? do we not see those, that do that, which you call evil, prosper? so that we may well conclude, either that their doings are well liked of by God; or else, if it be not so,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:33128:26"/>
                     <hi>where is the God of Judgment</hi>? sure either there is no such, (as <hi>Abarbinel</hi> notes this way of speaking to denote the not-being of a thing;) or else he is very negligent and slow in his executing judgement: else why doth he suffer so long such things, and not punish them?</q>
(so those scoffers, II <hi>Pet.</hi> III.4. <hi>where is the Promise of his coming</hi>?) so intimat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that from the ill ordering of things in distributing of justice, <note n="*" place="bottom">Abarb.</note> they thought either that God saw the evil things that were done, and was not displeased with them: or else did not see them, nor regarded them, and so was not a God of judgement. Such impious say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of theirs he shews that God was highly offended at, for their undertaking to be judges of the Seasons and circumstances, which he hath reserved the <note n="l" place="bottom">Grot.</note> judgement of to his own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and power, and to subject the depths of his judgments to their own shallow reason; and with this reproof of them is this Chapter concluded. But out of his great condescension in the next Chapter, he returns such an answer to these their causeless objections, as may teach them to <hi>discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not</hi>; as he speaks is the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verse of that Chapter.</p>

                  <hi>Grotius</hi> interprets what is rendred, <hi>ye have wearied,</hi> &amp;c. by <hi>ye will weary,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>when ye say,</hi> by <hi>in that ye will say,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>viz.</hi> so as to be a foretelling of their behavior in that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, that they should now be without Prophets and Miracles for many years, between the time that this was spoken, and the coming of that Messenger and Lord, in the next Chap. vers. 1. spoken of. And it is but reason, and agreeable to the words, that we should take in, together with what the Jews had done, since their return into their Country, and with what at present they did, all that they should do in that time, God foresaw what they would say or do, as already said or done. But to pass by all that was in that time done, and to look on the words, as reporting by way of Prophecy what is now by them done in their present dispersion, after the real completion of these Prophecies, as some <note n="m" place="bottom">R. Tanch.</note> Jews do, (according to what <hi>R. Tanchum</hi> thinks convenient, both here and Chap. III.14.) is wholly to elude this Prophecy; as then spoken, and to make void all that we beleive, and all that the history of the times testifies of the completion of it, by the coming of Christ, and the destruction of the Jews in the following words threatned, and to perswade us to look after that, which they vainly do, as if Christ were not yet come, but we were to look for another, to shut our eies against what hath been, and to look for what shall never be, to take off the Prophets words from the times that they concerned, and apply them to such as began not till all that he spake was manifestly fulfilled, so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king by a perverse method the end to be the beginning. Though they be now guilty of the same sin that the men of that generation then were, yet are not they the men then particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly spoken of and designed.</p>

How this Prophecy was in its due time fulfilled, the History of the Gospel clearly and fully shews: so that there is nothing in the cavils of the Jews, or any other that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge not the truth thereof, that can raise to us any doubt, as to the scope and true meaning of the whole; though in the explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the particular words may be some dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; which as far as may seem convenient, we shall take notice of, in going them over as they lie in order.</p>

For what is that Messiah the Son of <hi>Joseph,</hi> but a mere figment of their own brain, whom they suppose to be of the Tribe of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> on whom they may fasten those Prophecies, which foretell of the sufferings of Christ, that so they may take them off from Messiah the Son of <hi>David,</hi> to whom they will have none but glorious and triumphant things to pertain? as if they could not belong to one person, who through <note n="d" place="bottom">Luk. XXIV.26.</note> sufferings should enter into his glory. And this they do without any ground or war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from Scripture, only that they may deny our Christ to be the true and only Messiah, by the Prophets spoken of: so that to us, who believe the Gospell, this signifies nothing, nor hath in it any thing that may make it probable, so far as in this place to be embraced by others of their own profession. <hi>R. D. Kimchi</hi> thinks that by this <hi>Messenger</hi> is meant an Angel from Heaven;
<q>If, saith he, ye ask concerning the judgement of the wicked in this World, there shall come a time that you shall see, and then he will draw near to you for judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to consume the wicked that are among you: and that shall be the day when <hi>I will send my Angel, and he shall prepare</hi> (or <hi>clear) the way before me,</hi> and he shall be an Angel from Heaven, as it is written, <hi>Behold, I send my Angell before thee to keep thee in the way,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Exod.</hi> XXIII.20. and he shall clear the way before me: this shall be in the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering (or restoring) the captivity, so as that they shall not find in their way any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary, or evil occurrent.</q>
This Exposition of his appears, not to have pleased <hi>Abarbinel,</hi> by his taking no notice of it, when yet of his Exposition of the other words he doth; and by that he himself gives another far different from that or the others that have been mentioned: w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is,
<q>That by this Messenger is meant the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet himself that here utters these words from God, whose name is the same word here used, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Malachi,</hi> and being interpreted signifies, <hi>my Angell,</hi> or <hi>my Messenger</hi>:</q>
which cannot but seem strange to any, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet speaking of things to come, should be thought to prophesy of himself. But, to put the best color he can upon his opinion, he would perswade men, that Interpreters are out in interpreting these words wholly of the time to come, but that they are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood partly of what was at present, partly of what was to come, partly of what was past: of what was present, <hi>Behold I send Malachi my Prophet</hi>; of what was to come, <hi>The Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come, viz.</hi> the <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinah</hi> or majestatick glorious presence; of what was past, <hi>And the Messenger of the Covenant, whom ye delight in (viz.</hi> the King of <hi>Persia) hath already come</hi>: as if, to stop their mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings by reason of the prosperity of the wicked, he had now sent the Prophet <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachi</hi> to tell them what punishment is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined for those wicked hereafter; (as in the following part of the Chapter he will shew) and so to clear the way before him by solving their question, <hi>Where is the God of Judgement</hi>? And seeing they murmured, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>Shecinah,</hi> or glorious presence did not appear in the Temple they had now built; (in which were wanting the <hi>Shecinah,</hi> and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and fire from Heaven, and answer by <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> which were in the former Temple;) and objected that Gods Providence was removed from them, and all things were ill ordered; therefore to assure them, that the <hi>Shecinah</hi> should assuredly come again into the Temple that should hereafter be built, he saith, <hi>And the Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come into his Temple,</hi> there shall his glory and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestatick presence dwell, even that Lord which they now sought in their murmurings. And for a proof of this, and that this promise should certainly be performed, he instanceth in what they had already seen in what concerned the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> who was the Lords Angell, or Messenger, and Messiah or Anointed, for destroying of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and bringing back the dispersed of the Jews to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> according to what <hi>Esay</hi> prophecied of him, and made with them a Covenant of peace: of whom therefore he saith, <hi>And the Messenger of the Covenant whom ye delight in, i. e.</hi> to honor and love him, do you not see, that he came accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as was promised to you? <hi>so shall the Lord, whom ye seek, come suddenly and unawares, in the time of redemtion and gathering of the capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This is his meaning, as far as I can make it out in his Commentary on this place; and I suppose I have faithfully given it, and the giving of it is a sufficient confutation of it: so doth he distract the construction of the words, so blend and intermingle them with strange notions; that as he rejects the opinions of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of his own profession, so I suppose none of them will embrace this of his. All that we can gather from this, or any yet named, is, that they, not willing to see or acknowledg the truth, which the Christians instructed by the Gospell embrace, do strive to go as far from it as they can; mean while taking such
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:33128:27"/>
different waies, and disagreeing among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as that it is manifest they had no one probable thing to insist on.</p>
               <p>There is yet another opinion among them, (which <hi>Abarbinel</hi> glanceth on for a reserve, as a possible one, if the other of his own be not thought sufficient, although he doth not so apply it as others do) and that perhaps much ancienter then any of these we have yet seen; and such as by a right interpretation of the words, though not according to their meaning, might be reconciled to the truth. And that is, <note n="e" place="bottom">See Note on Micah, II.13.</note>
                  <q>That by this Messenger is meant he who, Chap. IV.5. is called <hi>Eliah,</hi> whom some of them would have to be <hi>Eliah</hi> the Tishbite in person: others, not necessarily so, but some great Prophet like him in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and therefore called by his name.</q>
So the often cited <hi>R. Tanchum</hi> reports their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion on that place, Chap. IV. where will be occasion to speak again of it. That this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion among them was ancient we learn, not only out of their own records, but out of the Gospell also, <hi>Mat.</hi> XVII.10. where we hear the Disciples asking Christ, <hi>Why then say the Scribes that Eliah must first come</hi>? their opinion then was, that before Christ <hi>Elias</hi> ought to come, as a Messenger and Forerunner: and Christ doth not say they were out in expecting such a one, as was to be looked on as <hi>Elias</hi>; but in this that they did not acknowledge him that was under that name expected to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready come, saying, <hi>Elias was truly first to come: but that indeed he was already come, and they knew him not,</hi> &amp;c. By which answer his Disciples understood, that he spake unto them of <hi>John the Baptist,</hi> of whom also he had before told them, and the whole People, that he was <hi>he of whom it is written, Behold I send my Messenger before thy face,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> II.10. and <hi>the Elias which was for to come.</hi> To those Jews, therefore, who are of the last opinion mentioned, we have from those words of our Saviour a ready answer, and to any objection that they shall raise from it, against their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving this Prophecy to be fulfilled, and the Messiah to be come. Whereas <note n="f" place="bottom">Trypho in Justin. Martyr, p. 208. Edit. Comel. 1593.</note> some of them, making it an argument in that kind, say, that this Prophecy is not fulfilled, because <hi>Elias</hi> is not in person come, and therefore neither the Messias; we refer them for answer to those of their own Sect, who confess that neither these, nor those other words of <hi>Malachi,</hi> nor any other Prophecy, require that <hi>Elias</hi> should come in person, but only some great Prophet or prophetical man in degree like to <hi>Elias.</hi> And then to these, if they say that not any such hath yet appeared, we say, Yes, there hath, and that <hi>John the Baptist</hi> was he, for he <hi>came before the Lord in the spirit and power of Elias, to make ready a People prepared for the Lord, Luc.</hi> I.17. He was by all that then lived and beheld his works, counted and holden for a Prophet, <hi>Mat.</hi> XIV.5. and XXI.26. yea, he was more then a Prophet, then whom <hi>there was not a greater risen among them that were born of women, Mat.</hi> XI.9, 11. so great, that they doubted whether he were not the Messiah himself.</p>
               <p>What was required from this Messenger, and from him that was promised under the name of <hi>Elias,</hi> viz. <hi>that he should prepare the way for the Lord,</hi> he did fully make good by preaching repentance, <hi>Mat.</hi> III.2. by bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing unto repentance, <hi>vers.</hi> 11. by bearing witness to Christ, and pointing him out to the People, that they might beleive on him, <hi>Joh.</hi> I.29. &amp;c. if there be any thing in that ancient <note n="g" place="bottom">In the same place.</note> Tradition of theirs, that <hi>Eliah</hi> was to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the Messiah to his office; that may be said to have been fulfilled by <hi>John</hi>'s baptizing Christ before he began to preach, at which baptizing the Holy Ghost descended on him visibly from Heaven. But this is besides the expression of the Scripture, and so not to the present words. <hi>John</hi> then being such as to his person, and so having performed that office, for which it is said here that he should be sent, what can it be but mere obstinacy to deny him to be the Lords Messenger here prophesied of? and what can they expect in any, which was not in him found?</p>
               <p>From the time of this Prophecy till the time of its completion by the Lords sending him, was their opinion true; that such a one, who for his excellency and the spirit with which he was to be endowed, might be called <hi>Eliah,</hi> was to come as a Messenger and a forerunner of the Messiah, to prepare his way before him: but since these things have been all fulfilled, still by virtue of the same Prophecy, to expect another, denying him, is great perversness. According to their own rule, <note n="h" place="bottom">Maimon. in Yad, the last C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Pinnah,</hi> which ours and others (agreeably also to what is in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels) render <hi>prepare,</hi> is from a root <hi>Panah,</hi> that hath also the signification of <hi>looking on,</hi> and is therefore by the Greek in this place, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that, rendered <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>shall look on</hi>; and so by the printed Arabick, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in follows them. Which certainly cannot be so agreeable to the meaning, except we extend it so far as to understand by it, <hi>to look to it,</hi> so as that it be as it should be, which then will be the same with <hi>preparing.</hi> But the word in that form that it is here, is not used for to <hi>look</hi> and <hi>consider,</hi> or the like; but to <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>make clean,</hi> to <hi>prepare</hi> by removing what is amiss or offensive: so likewise used <hi>Esay,</hi> XL.3. <hi>Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight a high way</hi>: which words are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise applied to the same <hi>John Baptist</hi>'s office here spoken of, <hi>Mat.</hi> III.3. and <hi>Mar.</hi> I.3. and <hi>Luc.</hi> III.4. and he shewed to make good what is thereby required, by calling to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and by preaching the Baptism of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, for putting away those sins which might hinder them from receiving Christ, and so were obstacles in his way. And in that place it is rendered by the Greek also <hi>prepare,</hi> and so probably they might here do.</p>
               <p>Having observed these words to be cited by the Evangelists, we cannot but take notice that in them they are cited something diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently from what is read here: for whereas here he saith, <hi>my Messenger, and before me,</hi> or <hi>my face,</hi> in the first person, as speaking of himself; there it is still said <hi>before thy face,</hi> and <hi>thy way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee,</hi> as speaking to, and of another. Which hath caused some question to be made, which of the persons of the Trinity here speaks, whether God the Father, or Christ. But though it be true what <note n="k" place="bottom">Ribera.</note> some here observe, that such works of the Trinity, as are external and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all the persons, and not proper to one, may indifferently be attributed to either; yet the plainest way of expounding these words here seems to be, to look upon them, as spoken here (as well as in the Evangelists) by God the Father concerning Christ; here <hi>of him,</hi> there expresly <hi>to him.</hi> And then the saying here, <hi>my Messenger, before me</hi>; and there <hi>thy way, before thee,</hi> making the same way to be called Gods way here, and <note n="l" place="bottom">See D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Hammond on Mat. XI.</note> Christs there, affords us an evident proof, that Christ is one God with the Father, <note n="m" place="bottom">I Tim. III.16.</note> and that in Christ God came, and was manifest in the flesh.</p>
               <p>For the proving the same, <hi>viz. That Christ is one with God the Father,</hi> some <note n="n" place="bottom">Galatin. Jansen.</note> would take from what is here said, <hi>before my face,</hi> an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, thence proving that Christ is called <hi>The face of God</hi>: but <note n="o" place="bottom">See Chr. à Castro.</note> others observe, that according to the use of the Hebrew Tongue, <hi>before my face,</hi> is no more then, <hi>before me.</hi> And therefore our Translators so rendring it, shew, that they thought not in the word <hi>my face</hi> to be included any argument for proving the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of Christ, on which any great stress ought to be laid: and they that think it, ought to shew <note n="p" place="bottom">See Ribera. and Chr. à Castro.</note> how then the words, as here uttered by the Prophet, and as cited in the Gospels, may be reconciled. For if by <hi>my face</hi> be here meant that Christ is the face of God, who then shall be there understood by <hi>thy face</hi>? who shall be called the face of Christ? It follows,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to his Temple,</hi> &amp;c.] Who by this <hi>Lord</hi> is meant is agreed on, on all hands by Christian Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters: <hi>viz.</hi> that it is Christ, <hi>whom God hath made both Lord and Christ, Act.</hi> II.36. and <hi>who is Lord over all,</hi> ibid. X.36. <note n="q" place="bottom">Joh. I.3.</note> by whom all things were made, by whom all things are sustained and governed; who is (as the root of the word imports) the basis and foundation, not of any private family, Tribe or Kingdome, but of all; by whom are all things, and we by him, I <hi>Cor.</hi> VIII.6. and whose we are also by right of Redemption; and so he is Lord of Lords, and King of Kings, <hi>Rev.</hi> XVII.14. and XIX.16. deservedly entituled <hi>The Lord.</hi>

And it is evident that old <hi>Simeon,</hi> to whom it was revealed by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death till he had seen the Lord's Christ, <note n="*" place="bottom">Luk. II.26, &amp;c.</note> who came by the spirit into the Temple, when Christ was thither first brought, and taking him in his arms blessed God, and desired of him then to <hi>depart in peace, because he had seen his Salvation</hi>; did so understand it; and that the Lord was now, according to this Prophecy, come to his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: he desired to see no more for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion of it. And so holy <hi>Anna</hi> also, who coming in that instant into the Temple, gave thanks likewise unto the Lord, and spake of him to all that looked for Redemption in <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem.</hi> And what else is proclaimed by all those multitudes, who at his going to the Temple, and at his being in it, cried, <hi>Hosanna to the Son of David, Blessed is he that cometh in the Name of the Lord, Mat.</hi> XXI.9, and 15. but the same, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Lord was now come to his Temple? and so it is witnessed that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this Prophecy, and that of <hi>Haggai,</hi> he was by the Jews of that time expected to
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:33128:29"/>
come to that Temple then in being. And so to us do they together afford an unanswerable argument against the later Jews, all that have lived since that time, that that Temple was standing, and deny the Messiah to be yet come, thus; Messiah was to come while the Temple was standing, and therefore seeing the Temple hath so long since been destroyed, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest that he is long since come, and in vain is now by them expected. For what is it else but blasphemously to accuse God speaking by his Prophets of falsehood? So poor a shift is it, which is all they have to flee to, to say that there is yet a third Temple to be expected, under which these Prophecies are to be fulfill'd; as that it cannot any way shake our Faith, but ought more to confirm it, while we see that they have for so many hundreds of years a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a thousand, expected what they without any ground or warrant from Scripture look for. It cannot without wilfull blindness and obstinacy be denied, that the Temple here mentioned was that second Temple, and more plainly when <hi>Haggai</hi> looking on, and describ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Temple then built, saith expresly, <hi>this house</hi>; by <hi>this house,</hi> to understand a house after this (as <hi>Abarbinel</hi> doth) is such a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting of words and meaning, as we cannot without loss of our own reason admit of. Yet this is the only <hi>salvo</hi> that they have, or can have. And this their great Doctor <note n="c" place="bottom">In Yad lib. ult. cap. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Maimonides</hi> seems to make use of, when finding no Temple for their yet vainly expected Messias to come to, saith,
<q>That the King Messiah shall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after come, and restore the Kingdom of the House of <hi>David</hi> to its old former estate, and shall build a <note n="*" place="bottom">

And in that regard perhaps they will have it called <hi>his Temple</hi> (as here it is) and so shift off another argument against the Jews, who deny Christs divinity, which is by Christian <note n="d" place="bottom">Vat.

                  <hi>Heicul,</hi> inasmuch as it doth not only signify a Temple, or House, of worship, but also a Palace; and so he thinks the Jews may put it off by saying it signifies only, the <hi>Messiah</hi> shall come to his <hi>Palace.</hi> But I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose they would not fly to that, I do not find any of them that do.</p>

This proves not, that he is not one God with the Father, though as a Son he yielded obedience to him, and performed his work. Here is nothing in this that takes away either <note n="g" place="bottom">Polan. lib. 3. c. 10.</note> unity of essence, or equality of power.

It will come but to one pass, he is <hi>Prince of the Covenant,</hi> for the same reason that he is called <hi>Messenger,</hi> or <hi>Angell</hi> of it: which is because in him God founded the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, and by him as Mediator of it, administred it; he, not only declaring it, but ratifying it with his own Blood, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving into it as many as lay hold on him; even that new Covenant (of which he is Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, <hi>Heb.</hi> XII.24.) better then the old, and established on better promises, <hi>Heb.</hi> VIII.6, 8, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> spoken of, <hi>Jer.</hi> XXXI.31. no more comprehending Jews alone, but Gentiles also.

Against the former is hence an evident proof, that of God the Father it cannot be meant, because a Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger is necessarily a distinct person from him that sends him. The Lord therefore and Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger here spoken of, must, as we affirm of Christ, needs be so. As for those who interpret both, as we do, of the Messiah, though much differing from us, as concerning the nature of his person; yet there is no occasion to dispute with them concerning that here, in that they agree, that the person by both titles described is the Messiah. As for others, who take by <hi>the Lord</hi> to be meant one, by the <hi>Messenger of the Covenant,</hi> another; so vain and absurd are their fancies, that to name them will be sufficient confutation of them, as not only that uncouth as well as novel opinion of <hi>Abarbinel,</hi> making it to be the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> who had sent them home from their Babylonish Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity; but also that of some more ancient, who would have to be meant <hi>Eliah,</hi> whom they would have to be called by that title, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he alwaies presides at the Rite of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, the sign of Gods Covenant with them, which they thus make out,
<q>God seeing his zeal for Circumcision, when those of the ten Tribes were negligent of it, gave him this priviledge as a reward of his zeal, that that Sacrament should never be administred, but that he should oversee it, for which cause alwaies at every Circumcision they set a Chair of State for him, as being <hi>Angel, Messenger,</hi> or <hi>President</hi> of the Covenant, and so here called.</q>

               <p>And here before we proceed, it will be covenient to take notice what the same learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man suggests to us on the next verse, <hi>viz.</hi> That Christs coming, when spoken to, and of the Jews, denotes not only his first manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:33128:30"/>
in the flesh, or the Temple; but all the time from his first preaching to the destruction of the City of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and of the Temple. Otherwise, more distinctly the word is applied to a <note n="l" place="bottom">D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Hammond on Mat. 24. note <hi rend="sup">b</hi>.</note> threefold coming of Christ, 1. His coming in the flesh, to be born among men. 2. His coming in Judgement for vengeance to his enemies, and deliverance of his Servants in this World, as he did come at the destruction of the Jews. 3. At the end of the World, at the day of Judgement. And so understanding it as particularly respecting the Jews, we shall easily perceive here a full and satisfactory an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to those murmurers and scoffers of those times, who seeing the prosperity of some wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men (as it is in the last verse of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Chapter) said, <hi>every one that doth evil is good in the sight of the Lord, and he delighteth in them,</hi> or, <hi>where is the God of Judgement</hi>? Though such who impiously question Gods Justice, deserve no other answer then to feel it, yet in much condescension he here vouchsafes them such an answer as to let them know, that though he doth not presently proceed, as they would have him, but seem to neglect or wink at the doings of wicked men; yet he is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligent, but in his own appointed time will so order things, as shall make it manifest to all, that he took notice all the while of what was done. This time, as to them, he here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses to be that coming of Christ, which is in these and the following words described; in which time was his just judgement signally executed before the whole World, as to what concerned their Nation: And so the question, why God suffers the wicked, oft, most to flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish? as to them of that Nation, the People then by the Prophet spoken to and of, is fully decided by what was in that space of time by him brought to pass, so as to stop the mouth of any other, who shall in like blasphemous manner question his Justice; by warning them to leave to him his own time to execute his just Judgements, and rather to prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves for that time, which certainly shall come upon them, then in any way to doubt of it.</p>
               <p>The things here spoken do more particularly concern the Jews, but are to all, and to us, for <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. 10.6.</note> examples, and are written for our admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, God having several waies of executing his Judgements, but proceeding still according to the same rule of Justice. They likewise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern rather more general and national impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and judgements accordingly executed; yet so, as every particular man may thence take instruction, that none who taketh care of his waies, seeing such as are openly wicked to prosper and florish, should thence take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of murmuring and questioning Gods Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, nor any wicked man that prospers in this World, should, because God suffers him so to do, for that justify himself, or think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self good in the sight of the Lord, or that God delighted in him, but be assured that a time will come, when God will execute just Judgement on him, however for a time he forbear him, and so deal with him in particular, as he here threatneth to do with the wicked of those times. He hath other waies of coming, besides that here spoken of: to every man, at his death, and after judgement, which though <hi>R. Salomo,</hi> as we have seen, doth ill in making the prime and literal meaning of this place, as he doth, yet so far he is true, that certainly God will by it come to every man in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and then judge and distinguish them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the things that they have done, not the things that they have enjoied in this World. His deferring them till then is not a sign of his liking to them, but shall make (if they by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance prevent it not) for their greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation and misery, and so shall it appear that they are out, who for what they see them here to enjoy shall account them happy. See <hi>Luke</hi> XVI.25.</p>
               <p>This may seem a digression, as not pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the literal meaning of the words, yet may be not impertinent, in regard that both the present words and other passages after in this Chapter, cannot but suggest such conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Gods just Judgement both for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate persons, and whole Societies of men, to us. That some <note n="m" place="bottom">See Ribera, and Chr. à Castro, &amp;c.</note> Christians anciently should interpret the word, <hi>come,</hi> in the first place, of Christs first coming, and in this second, of his coming to Judgement, cannot but seem strange. Doubtless, here is but one and the same co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming spoken of, and the repetition of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of it, doth but confirm the certainty of it, and that was the first coming of his, then, when these words were spoken, to be expected by the Jews. The words will naturally bear no other sense.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>But who may abide the day of his coming,</hi> &amp;c.] By looking to what precedes in the last verse of the former Chapter, and the first of this, the connexion of these words with the former seems thus, The Jews of those times seeing (as they thought) all things out of order then amongst them, the godly oppressed and the wicked exalted, murmured against Gods Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, and having had promises from God of one who should set all things to right, as doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:33128:30"/>
of the truth of those promises, seeing them so long deferred, ask'd, <note n="n" place="bottom">2 Pet. III.4.</note> 
                  <hi>Where is the God of Justice? where is the promise of his coming</hi>? He answereth them therefore, that he is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligent of their affairs, nor slack concerning his promise, but what they counted slackness was long-suffering towards them, that they might be prepared for receiving that Lord whom they sought after, that Messenger of his Covenant, whose coming they longed to see, as expecting that then all things should go ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their desires, and they should have great cause of rejoicing, in seeing the wicked severely dealt withall, and themselves esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished in worldly prosperity and pleasure; mean while, not examining themselves how they were fit for such things as they expected. He therefore tells them, that certainly without any failing on his part, that Lord should come at his appointed time; but that before him also should come a Messenger to prepare his way before him, by calling them (that thought best of themselves) to prepare for his coming; For that it should not be so easy to them as they fancied to themselves, without more ado to give them what they expected of wordly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiments, and without farther trial to give them what they thought themselves worthy of; but that it should be with great severity, and so as in strict Justice to proceed after trial made of all, for good to those who should be found faithful and sincere, and for destruction to those that were otherwise; so that the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous should not without <note n="o" place="bottom">I Pet.

For in that day many shall be made white, <hi>i. e.</hi> tryed, saith <hi>Kimchi,</hi> in the words of <hi>Daniel,</hi> XII.10. <hi>even the righteous shall pass a hard trial that they may be purified and made white,</hi> though not consumed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed as the wicked: so that even to them the day of his coming should be terrible, though salutary. This that they might expect, and yet among those difficulties find comfort, Christ himself having taken our sins upon him, took on him the Cross, that he might enter by it into his Kingdom, and shew to his the way that they must also go, if they will enter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into, <hi>viz.</hi> by taking up their Cross and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing him.

               <p>Though the generality of the Jews did, I suppose, then expect nothing but present joy and prosperity at his coming, yet we may well think that those that better considered the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, had other notions like those, that we have expressed, of the day of his coming and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, by that Tradition which those since report to us, as from them, of the <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Cheble,</hi> as they denote <hi>bitter pangs,</hi> as of a woman in travel, and so used for any great pains or afflictions. So that, if that Tradition among them were ancienter then Christs coming, and the Gospel, it may not improbably be thought, that our Saviour did by such terms as were then in use among them, and in their mouths, set forth those dolorous times which they did talk of and expect; so to warn them to prepare for them, as now at hand; and a certain proof, that Messiah, of whose being come they were, by their own confession, to be a sign, was now come, and they ought to acknowledge it. And in expressions so full of dread doth he describe those <hi>pangs,</hi> sorrows, or afflictions, of that time and day of his coming to the Jews (which were accordingly made good in that space of time, which we said to be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under the day of his coming, and his appearing) as that nothing can surpass or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual them, but the day of his last coming, at the terrible day of Judgement, to all People at the end of the World; insomuch that it may even seem doubtfull, whether that day were not meant by divers of them, in those Chapters of <hi>Mat.</hi> XXIV. <hi>Mar.</hi> XIII. and <hi>Luc.</hi> XXI. which we have cited. At least, this is set forth as a type and figure of that: insomuch that as well in respect to this time of such tribulation, as had not been from the Creation, here spoken of, as of that, might be said, as well concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing even the Elect among the Jews, (for whose sakes our Saviour saith, those daies should be shortened, whereas else <hi>no flesh should be saved, Mat.</hi> XXIV.22.) to whom the issue should be <note n="v" place="bottom">Luk.

                  <hi>Luke</hi> is expressed by <hi>being accounted worthy to escape all those things, that should come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.</hi> What we, with most others, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>who may abide,</hi> &amp;c. is by the Vulgar Latin rendred, <hi>who shall be able to think of the day of his coming, and who shall stand to see him?</hi> To express emphatically, I suppose, the terror here intimated. For if none can think of it by reason of the power or dreadfulness of his Majesty, who shall be able to abide or bear it? saies S. <hi>Jerom,</hi> including both significations. Not that the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Mecalcel,</hi> or its root doth properly signify <hi>to think of</hi> (it is no where else so found) the properer signification being to <hi>bear,</hi> or <hi>sustain,</hi> which it hath, <hi>Jer.</hi> XX.9. And so farther describing the terror of those times, or giving a reason of the terror of them, he adds, <hi>For he is like a Refiners fire, and like Fullers Sope.</hi> In words taken from things of known and ordinary use, he describes the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of those Judgements, which should then come on all in that Country, for trial to all, and destruction to the wicked. <hi>He is</hi> (saies he) <hi>like a Refiners fire,</hi> or as the construction will also bear, as <note n="y" place="bottom">Vulg. Lat. <hi>R.</hi> Tanch.</note> 
                  <hi>refining fire,</hi> though the other seems more proper. The use of that fire is to melt metals and try them, that so what is pure may be by it self retained, the dross being either consumed, or so separated as to be taken away from it. And then the People being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to mixt metal, that hath in it what is pure and what is dross; and the Lord that should come in Judgement, being compared to fire, which shall throughly try that metal; the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will be plain (as <hi>R. Tanchum</hi> expresses it) that he will consume or take away the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressors and rebellious amongst them, as the Refiners fire consumes or separates the <note n="z" place="bottom">Psal. CXIX.119.</note> dross of melted metals, and cleanseth them from what is false and unsincere: and this so, as that the good and sincere shall at once be put to severe tryal, every one in their own persons, as the good metal also, the sincere gold or sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver endureth the hardship or trial of the fire, though preserved, and at last coming forth more pure, refined and purged: So as this may be applied to what concerns them in their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars also, which by those tryals and afflictions shall be made sensible of their sins, and what is amiss in them, that so purging themselves from them, they may become vessels of greater honor, sanctified and meet for the Lords use, and prepared unto every good work, as the Apostles words are, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> II.21. But the words seem here more to concern the whole mass or community of the People, all calling themselves by the same name of Gods People; but many of them being not so, whom now by the refining fire of his Judgements he would distinguish from the true Israelites, and by the same means prove the one, and bring to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction the other; as was actually done by those heavy calamities, which ended in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the Country, City of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and the Temple, by the Romans, about the 70<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year of Christ. The same is plainly likewise the meaning of the other similitude added, <hi>and like Fullers Soap,</hi> the use of which is to scour wooll or cloth, and purge out all spots and stains in it, and take them away, leaving the wooll or cloth, though by the same means fretted and rubbed, the more white or brighter colored. As that takes away all spots, so shall he take away all wicked ones, saith <hi>R. Salomo.</hi>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:33128:31"/>

               <p>Here we may not pass unobserved that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Christian <note n="b" place="bottom">Ribera, Menoch. Tirin. Quistorp.</note> Expositors interpret this, not of those visible judgements and afflictions which we have spoken of, but of the irresistible force of Christs word and preaching, which may be compared indeed to fire, as <hi>Jer.</hi> V.14, and XXIII.29. and is expressed by things of greatest force and power, which nothing can resist, as <hi>Heb.</hi> IV.12. by <hi>a two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit,</hi> &amp;c. and called a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the hearts, which spared no sin or sinner; and of the efficacy of his <note n="c" place="bottom">Diodat.</note> grace and spirit working on the obdurate hearts of men, and the like: which may be added to what hath been said, as the words seem to require it should. Otherwise, I suppose the way that we have taken to give a fuller and more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per meaning of the words, and such as will be of more use in dealing with the Jews to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them, that all here spoken hath been ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, all those calamities, those pangs of the Messiah, which they expected that the coming of Messiah should be accompanied with, did accordingly seize on them in that day of his coming; including the time (as we said) from his preaching to the destruction of the Temple, brought on them by their obstinacy in refusing to hearken and turn to him: and so what is here said, to intimate what is more fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by Christ in the Gospels concerning that time. The other <note n="d" place="bottom">In the above cited, Mat. XXIV. &amp;c.</note> Exposition alone perhaps will not gain much from them.</p>
               <p>As to the expression here used, it may be compared with several others in the Scripture: So (as <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> and <hi>Kimchi</hi> will) with what is said, <hi>Zach.</hi> XIII.9. where God saith, <hi>I will bring the third part through the fire, and I will refine them as silver is refined,</hi> &amp;c. as likewise, <hi>Isa.</hi> I.25. <hi>I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy dross, and take away all thy tin</hi>: and <hi>Ezech.</hi> XXII.18, 19, 20, 21, 22. <hi>as they gather silver, and dross, and iron, and lead, and tin into the midst of the furnace, and blow the fire upon it to melt it;</hi> 
                  <note n="e" place="bottom">See Jer. XXIX.</note> 
                  <hi>so will I gather you in my anger, and melt you,</hi> &amp;c. (<hi>v.</hi> 20.) <hi>as silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye be melted,</hi> &amp;c. (<hi>v.</hi> 22.) and <hi>Luk.</hi> XII.49. <hi>I am come to send fire on the Earth,</hi> &amp;c. and II <hi>Thess.</hi> I.8. <note n="f" place="bottom">See D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Hammond.</note> where he speaketh of a time, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from Heaven <hi>in flaming fire,</hi> &amp;c. with other like places. Which what judgements they concern will not be to our purpose at present to enquire; but only thus much, that it is usual to compare Gods severity in proceeding against sin, to such purging and refining fire, which melts and tries the whole mass, but purifies the good, and <note n="g" place="bottom">See I Pet.

So those judgements often fall promiscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously on all both good and bad; but the end is different, and when the wicked are destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the godly are only purged and made more precious in the sight of God, yet so as that in regard of that severe examination and trial, which they shall endure; even in respect of them also it may justly be asked, <hi>who may abide the day of his coming?</hi> &amp;c. According to the same notion he adds in respect of the present trial here spoken of,
<q>
                     <hi>3</hi> And he shall sit <hi>as</hi> a refiner and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness.</q>

               <p>
                  <hi>And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>R. D. Kimchi,</hi> as before, so here also, what ours and others attribute to the person of the Lord, takes as spoken of the time called <hi>the day of his coming,</hi> thus giving the meaning of the words,
<q>As a Judge that sitteth to judge the People, and to distinguish the offender from the innocent; so shall be that day, which shall refine and cleanse the silver, and take away from it the dross, or refuse; and they are the wicked.</q>

He shall set aside all other works, that he may be as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finer, saith <hi>R.

The Chalde renders it,
<q>He shall be revealed, or reveal himself, to melt and cleanse, as a man that melteth and cleanseth silver.</q>

               <p>But who are meant by the Sons of <hi>Levi</hi> is not well accorded by Expositors.

As to the last which understands it of the Sons of <hi>Levi</hi> properly so called, as of that race; of such as were won to the obedience of Christ by the word of his Gospell, and had their hearts purified by faith in him; of them may it be truly verified, that they were purified and purged as gold and silver by him <hi>sitting as a refiner and purifier of silver</hi>: and it cannot be doubted, but that they had their parts in that sharp trial of afflictions too in those daies. And as for them who were all dross, and would not be purified, but continued in their corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, what became of them, the sad story of the destruction of the City and Temple (which we take to be deciphered by this day of his coming, and the trying and purifying here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed) shews, when so many of them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Temple, perished by fire: as that if the expression here were properly meant of material fire, it might be said to have been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified in them; although we do not here take it as so meant, but only to express the strictness and exactness of the trial. It is said that he shall so purify and purge them, that they shall offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness. In the times when this was spoken, that they did not so, is shewed in the preceding Chapters. Because they were so perverse in their waies, so wicked in their doings, he tells them that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded not the offering, (by which they thought to satisfy his Law, and do to him acceptable service) nor received it with good will at their hands. As likewise, <hi>Isa.</hi> I.19. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he calls the Sacrifices they pretended to do to him, while their hands were full of wickedness, <hi>vain obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>; the incense they brought, <hi>abomination unto him</hi>; their feast, <hi>iniquity and trouble to him,</hi> and that, when they <hi>make many prayers,</hi> he <hi>will not hear.</hi> Before they can do any thing that shall be acceptable to him, they must <hi>wash them, and make them clean, put away the evil of their doing, cease to do evil, learn to do good,</hi> &amp;c.

That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore among these that are here called <hi>Sons of Levi,</hi> (whether be meant all Christians, or those that are peculiarly separated to the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string to God in holy things, or such of the Jewish Levites that were converted to Christ) there may be such as may offer to him an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering in righteousness, rightly, lawfully and acceptably, not to the farther displeasing of him (as those in this Prophet reprehended then did) he saith that he will first <hi>purify them as silver, and purge them as gold and silver,</hi> from all dross and corruptions that are in them, by such means as he sees convenient, whether by the powerfull efficacy of his Word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Grace, and Spirit, or farther (if he see necessary) by the fiery trial of sufferings, by the <note n="s" place="bottom">Isa. IV.4.</note> spirit of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and of burning, to separate the sincere of them from those that are not such: and then they being so purged, and with sincere hearts and pure hands, presenting their offerings in righteousness to him, shall be accepted, both they and their offerings: so saith he in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>4</hi> Then shall the offerings of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the Lord, as in the daies of old, and as in formeryears.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then shall the offerings of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the Lord.] Judah</hi> and <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> are named (saith <hi>Kimchi</hi>) because there was the Temple or Sanctuary. It will be easy to translate the names to the Church of Christ, of which that City was a type, and which thence was to have its <note n="t" place="bottom">Tirin. and see Notes on Micah IV.1, 2.</note> rise and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, though since spread abroad through the World; so that it will be all one to say the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of the Church. But what offerings are then to be understood? not certainly such legal Sacrifices or <hi>Mincha</hi>'s, as were then under the Law offered. For this is spoken of what was to be after the coming of the Messiah, by whose once offering of himself all such legal offerings had an end put to them, and were for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to cease. By the offerings (the <hi>Mincha</hi> or offering, as it is in the singular number) of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jerusalem</hi> therefore must be meant all the spiritual offerings and services of the Church, and the faithful Members thereof; their <note n="u" place="bottom">Psal. CXlI.2.</note> Prayers, <note n="x" place="bottom">Heb. XIII.15.16.</note> Alms, Praises, Eucharisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Sacrifices, their whole selves offered to God, as a living Sacrifice, holy acceptable to God, <hi>Rom.</hi> XII.1. all comprehended under that pure <hi>Mincha,</hi> or offering, <note n="y" place="bottom">See the Notes thereon.</note> Ch. I.11. they being all made a holy Priesthood to offer up spiritual Sacrifices acceptable to God, I <hi>Pet.</hi> II.5. Much of the service under the Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting in offering oblations, that name is trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to all Evangelical services.</p>
               <p>It is said they shall <hi>be pleasant as in the daies of old, and as in former years,</hi> in the daies of the pious Patriarks, say <note n="z" place="bottom">Cyril. Vatab. Grot. &amp;c.</note> some. <note n="a" place="bottom">Drus. Aben Ezra.</note> Others, in the time of the first Temple, and when the worship of God florished in <hi>Judea</hi>: or <note n="b" place="bottom">Abarb.</note> the time of the Tabernacle that <hi>Moses</hi> pitcht.</p>
               <p>But it will not concern particularly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign the time, the Text having not so designed it, it will be sufficient to understand it, that the services in the time here spoken of, by such and in such manner as he describes, done, shall be as acceptable and pleasing to God, as any ever heretofore by holy and pious men in due manner performed, were, and not loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some and displeasing to him, as those offerings of that present Age by wicked men, unduly and with neglect and breach of his law offered, were.</p>
               <p>But here is observable that from what he saith, that <hi>the Sons of Levi shall be purified,</hi> and then offer <hi>offerings in righteousness,</hi> and <hi>pleasant unto God,</hi> as those of holy men of old, on, and after the coming and appearance of the Lord the Messiah, there is an evident proof, that by that coming of his here spoken of, is not meant his last coming to judgement (inasmuch as after that will be no time for such services: they are to be performed in this life and this World, not in the life and World to come) but a coming in this World, after which it should yet last, in which is a time of purging; the other being a time only of remuneration, according to what men have in this done.

Yet if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider to whom, (<hi>viz.</hi> the Nation of murmuring Jews,) and on what occasion the words were then spoken, and how there is in them (as this) that which agrees to things in this life and World, not so properly to that; we shall see that they must have respect to such judgments
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:33128:33"/>
as God would exercise towards that Nation in this World, and taking the time denoted by <hi>the day of the Lord,</hi> the Messiah's coming, for that time, which (as we said) was from the first preaching of <hi>John Baptist,</hi> and Christ, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the destruction of the Country, City, and Temple of <hi>Jerusalem</hi>; and considering what was done in those times, we shall easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that all by the Lord in this Prophet spoken, was so far fulfilled, as that in regard thereof alone, not one word of his may be said to have fallen to the ground: though, as then the words might warn them, who were then in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets time living, and should die before the execution of such Gods publick judgments on the Community or Nation, of a certain account that they should after this life, if not before, be brought to, for their doings; so they ought still to warn all, whether particular persons, or whole Nations, to expect in Gods due time to be brought to judgement, at least after this life, if not in it too: what happened to them, being for example to all, and their concern so to make use thereof, that purifying themselves before hand, and doing to God acceptable ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, they be not consumed as dross.</p>

                  <hi>And I will come near to you in judgement,</hi> &amp;c.] An answer to their former groundless murmurings and questionings in the last verse of the preceding Chapter, he hath in the former verses given, and in this and the next verse continues it in terms coming close to the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion there by them made, <hi>where is the God of Judgement</hi>? he here answers, <hi>I will come near to you to Judgement.</hi> Before he spake as of a third person, <hi>The Lord shall come,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and he shall sit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and he shall purify,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>viz.</hi> The Lord Christ, the second person of the blessed Trinity; here in the first person, as of God the Father, <hi>I will come near,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>Or, I will come in Judgement, first <note n="*" place="bottom">Tirinus.</note> to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, and also as occasion shall serve, to punish; but will perfectly complete it at the day of the last Judgement.

               <p>Against whom he will so proceed, he shews by reckoning up divers notorious sins, which his specifying shews to have been then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon amongst them: and besides that, he will in like manner proceed against all others guilty in other like kinds of sins contrary to his Law; as these expresly are.

And how under the second, and in the later de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate times, they addicted themselves to the like vain diabolical arts, (one here named comprehends the rest, which in the Law are distinguished by several names) is proved by the learned D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

The connexion of the former part of them with the preceding, according to the way that we have gone, will be easy; <hi>viz.</hi> That although he have so long forborn to take ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of the wicked, yet they are not to think, that it is because he approves of their doings, or is grown neglectful of those that take care to serve him; but that he will in due time exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his judgements on the one, according to what he hath threatned against such as go on in evil waies, and shew his care of the other; inasmuch as he is still the same God of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, unchangeably the same, a hater and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain avenger of evil, and a lover of good: and therefore all his threats and promises, however seeming to be deferred, shall in their due time certainly come to pass, and have their due ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. But how then doth what he subjoins, <hi>therefore,</hi> (or <hi>and) ye sons of Jacob are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed?</hi> follow on these? Because (as we said) Expositors in giving the meaning of these words much differ, it will be convenient to take some of their Interpretations distinctly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>R. Salomo</hi>'s note on this place is, Although I do defer my anger, I have not changed my

Salomo</hi>'s, in that, what is spoken of a particular signal day and judgement in this World, he expounds of that which continually did befall, and still doth befall all men in their times; <hi>viz.</hi> the day of death, and of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of the Soul, which things being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all men, and before known to all the Jews, cannot be the utmost meaning or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of a new Prophecy directed to the Jews; and particularly concerning their Nation, to shew them some new thing that should betide them, and satisfy that question then in their mouths, <hi>Where is the God of Judgement</hi>? with some new answer. However, that which he saith be in it self true, it is not here, by it self, to the purpose, and it seems to proceed on his former wrong supposal, that <hi>ver.</hi> 1. by the Lords <hi>Messenger</hi> is meant the Angell of death, and by the <hi>Lord</hi> here spoken of, the God of Judgement, without respect to the Messiah; and not to come home at all to the taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the murmuring of the People, of which he complains, and shews it to be causeless, and through ignorance of what he now declares to them.</p>
               <p>This objection against him <hi>Abarbinel</hi> suggests to us, in what he saith on the first and second verses, but here, where he falls in with him, it stands firm against himself: for here we are not (as he doth) to look on these words, as spoken of a distinct time, or persons, or judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from those that are in those former words spoken of, but as concerning still the same day or time, (as <hi>Kimchi,</hi> as we have seen, well notes;) and all directing to some visible judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereby God in that appointed time should clear his Justice, which they now look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the prosperity of the wicked called in question, and make manifest his immutability in his hatred of the wicked, though he do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently execute sentence on them, and his love to the godly; whom though he suffer to endure for a while perhaps hard trial, yet he still takes care of their final preservation, and will in his due time make it apparent, by what shall be then visibly done by some distinguishing judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: which to the particular day of mens dying, and the judgment that they shall then be brought to, invisible and unknown to others, (so that
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:33128:34"/>
thereby Gods love and hatred to the one or the other are not easily discerned, <note n="*" place="bottom">Eccles. IX.1.</note> one thing, as far as man can discern befalling them, and one dying as the other dieth,) is not so kindly appliable.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>David Kimchi,</hi> neither can his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position here take place, it running (as to the latter part) on a false supposition, which may not be granted, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Lord and his Messenger, who were, as is evident (<hi>ver.</hi> 1.) to come to the Temple then standing, which is long since destroyed, and by whom the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment spoken was to be brought near unto them, (<hi>v.</hi> 5.) are not yet come, nor that judgment yet executed, but are yet (no man knows when) to be expected, and that the judgement, with which that Nation is here particularly threatned, was to be executed only on other Nations, there remaining for the Jews, only a triumphant return to their ancient dignity, and a flourishing estate in this World; which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly are no way intimated in the words, but on the contrary a destruction of all the sinners among them by a national Judgement, though the godly among them were not to be thereby consumed. All which hath been already so fully compleated in the destruction of that People, within few years after Christs coming, that to pass by what hath been done, and look after things to be done, not at all by God here, or else where promised, is to delude, and not to give a true Exposition of this Prophecy.</p>
               <p>From none of these Expositions therefore (as we said) have we certainly the right mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of these words, as to the scope of them; all that we may gain by them to our purpose is a justification of the signification of some of the words, as they are by our Translators ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and particularly of the two Verbs, the first in <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Lo celitem, ye are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed</hi>: in the giving of the meaning of which, <hi>R. Ab. Ezra,</hi> and <hi>R. Tanchum</hi> agree with those already named, only that the latter of them thinks that both of them, though in the form of the preterperfect tense, ought to be rendred in the signification of the future, <hi>I will not change,</hi> and <hi>ye shall not be consumed</hi>; making the former to include a reason of the returning of Gods Providence to them as it was of old, and giving for the meaning,
<q>These promises shall certainly come to pass, although they be deferred for a long while, for no change or failing shall happen to me: and likewise ye shall remain by the remaining of my Law among you, neither shall you be consumed or cease to be.</q>
Into which meaning we shall not further enquire, he not fully expressing of it. If he mean the same that <hi>Kimchi</hi> doth, the same answer will serve. That which we take notice of, is, that according to these the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the first word is given, by saying that God doth not, or will not alter his purpose and Decree, concerning his hatred of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and in his appointed time bringing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dign punishment obstinate sinners, or his love to the good and care of them; so that however he delay the time of his evidencing these things by open judgements, his Justice is not to be questioned, as if he now liked or approved of such things or persons, which he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly declared his dislike unto.</p>
               <p>This while with them we look on, as the import of the word here, we cannot but won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the impudence and folly of that railing Jew <note n="o" place="bottom">See Wagen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <hi>Lipman,</hi> who saith that Christians go con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the meaning of what is here said, in affirming, that God, who before had not flesh and blood, was changed to be flesh and blood, or, as another Copy hath it, who was before only the Father, and the Holy Spirit, was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward changed to be the Son. In which obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his is only much malice and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency; inasmuch as by nothing that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians say, nor by any consequence that can be drawn from what they say, can it be concluded that they affirm any change or alteration in God or the Godhead, with whom they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess to be no variableness, neither shadow of changing, either in his nature or any of his attributes, all things remaining in him, the eternal Trinity, one God in three Persons, as they were from eternity; nor by Christs taking the Manhood into God, was there any change of God into Man, nor confusion of substance, or alteration of person. Again, inasmuch as, that he might pick a cavil against Christians, he takes the word which here denotes Gods immutability in his Will, Word, Decree, and purpose, which with the Jews the Christians absolutely affirm, as if it imported here immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability of nature or substance, (though that be most true also:) so that it is a cavil sought, not offered to him, either by the word as here used, nor any thing by the Christians affirmed. He had no occasion to say this, but he having said it, it was convenient to take some notice of it, lest others of his Sect might applaud him in it, and think to be true what he feigneth.</p>
               <p>But of the concurrence of the other Jews, in rendring the latter Verb in the same notion that our Translators do, who render it <hi>are not consumed,</hi> we take more notice, because some learned Christians take it in another significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and would have it rendred, <hi>And ye sons of Jacob</hi>

as likewise the printed Arabick Version fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing that, and the Syriack also. And from the word in that notion rendred, would flow a very convenient sense, taking the whole verse as a confirmation of what is before said; and that they certainly must expect that judgement denounced to come in its appointed time, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as the Lord is unchangeable in his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of punishing incorrigible, unrepenting sinners, and they would not leave off their evil courses, nor repent them of their sins, nor desist from them.</p>
               <p>But others, and they the major part, <hi>viz.</hi> all that follow the vulgar Latin and diverse others also of modern Interpreters, prefer, with the forementioned Jewish Writers, the other notion of being <hi>consumed,</hi> as more usual to the Verb in the Conjugation or form here used; according to which our Translators render <hi>are not consumed</hi>: but then in giving the meaning and connexion of the whole verse, there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong those who embrace this signification of this word some difference. Some taking it as speaking of the time past or present, make the coherence with what goes before, and the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to this purpose, as may be collected out of them put together; that doubtless it shall be so as he said, he will come in judgement to those sinners. For he (the Lord) who hath determined and pronounced that he will not leave impenitent sinners unpunished, doth not change his will and purpose. But how then is it that the Sons of <hi>Jacob,</hi> whose Fathers and themselves have been great and obstinate sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, have not long since been, or are not yet consumed? It is from the same unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness in God, who as he is just, so is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise merciful and long suffering, not willing the death of sinners, but rather that they should come to repentance: and therefore determined as to execute justice, so not to be hasty in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting it, but to give space for repentance, that so the necessity and equity of his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments executed on such as would not lay hold on his mercy by repentance, while they had time allowed for it, may appear: and besides, that he might shew how just he was in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing promise, and his Covenant made with their Forefathers, <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> in so long sparing for their sakes their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious posterity, who would make no end of sinning: So that it was not through any change in him, that they have not yet been consumed, but shall now be severely punished; but from his mercy and their obstinacy opposing and reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting it. So that they cannot but say (if they will rightly consider the matter) <hi>it is of the Lords mercy that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not. Great is thy faithfulness, Lam.</hi> III.22, 23.</p>
               <p>This, however they differ in expressions, seems to be the scope that the most of <note n="q" place="bottom">Pelican. Ribera, Chr. à Castro's Paraph. Tirin. Tarnov. Stock. &amp;c.</note> Expositors will have these words to aim at. There are that read them by way of interrogation or admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <note n="r" place="bottom">Sanctius.</note> 
                  <hi>For I the Lord change not, and are not ye, O Sons of Jacob, consumed</hi>? how wonderful a thing is it that the Lord being immutable in his judgement against refractory sinners, they should not yet be consumed! how hath mercy prevailed against judgement! This falls in with what hath been already said, and requires the same answer.</p>
               <p>There may be proposed another way thus,
<q>Expect certainly the execution of the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment spoken of, and that I will in due time call to an account sinners, for I the Lord change not:</q>
                  <note n="s" place="bottom">See Vatab.</note> Of which that you may not doubt, you have from a contrary effect and evidence of my immutability a proof; for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ye Sons of <hi>Jacob</hi> are not consumed; though the wicked have hitherto domineer'd, and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness reigned, yet you true Sons of <hi>Jacob,</hi> that fear me, as <hi>Jacob</hi> did, have been preserv'd; by virtue of my promise and mercy they have not been able to root you out.</p>
               <p>But as we saw before, that by a learned Jew it is noted, that this Verb is to be rendred ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the signification of the future, and with respect to what was to come, not to what was past or present; so it is by <note n="t" place="bottom">Castal Grot.</note> some of good judgement and learning among Christians also taken, that the words may be rendred, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, or and, ye Sons of <hi>Jacob</hi> shall not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed, as part of the Prophecy of what should be to the godly, when the Lord should come to execute his Judgement spoken of on the wicked: and for making out the meaning to this purpose, they understand by the Sons of <hi>Jacob</hi> the godly amongst the Jews, (they who being of the Faith of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and following his steps, deserved peculiarly to be called his Children or Sons, according to what we learn in like kind, whom properly to call Children of <hi>Abraham, Galat.</hi> III.7. and <hi>Rom.</hi> IX.7.) and then the coherence will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear thus, I will certainly come near to you in judgment, against the sinners among you. For I am the Lord and change not, but am still, as ever, inexorable to obstinate impenitent sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, one that will in due time take vengeance on them however for a long time I have spared them; but ye true Sons of <hi>Jacob,</hi> ye whose heart is right with me, and who lay hold on my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to him made, and by walking in his steps approve your selves his genuine Children, heirs of his Faith; ye, as you are not partakers of their sins, so neither shall ye be of the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments brought upon them: I will make a way for your escape, that ye perish not with them. And that so he effected it, is made evident by the history. When the judgement here prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied of had its execution and completion in the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:33128:35"/>
destruction of the City and Temple of <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and the wicked obstinate sinners of the Jews in it; God provided for the escape and deliverance of such as had embraced the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Christ, and yielded obedience to him: so that they were not consumed, as, if God had not taken a special care for them, they must necessarily have been. And so taking by that <hi>day of the Lords coming</hi> to be meant the space (as we have said on the first and second verses) betwixt <hi>John Baptist</hi>'s and Christ's beginning to preach, and the destruction of the Temple; and by that <hi>swift judgement</hi> the destruction of the wicked among the Jews, together with their City and Temple; and by <hi>the Sons of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> those that believed in Christ, whom <hi>Jacob</hi> so long before waited for, and transmitted the expectation of to his posterity; and by what is said that <hi>they should not be consumed,</hi> their escape and wonderful preservation from that so uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal a destruction, by their being from God warned to go out of the City, while there was an opportunity offered, which accordingly they did to a place called <hi>Pella,</hi> so that there was not one Christian left in the City when it was destroyed, but all escaped, as <hi>Eusebius</hi> te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifies in the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> book of his History, <hi>Cap.</hi> 5. and <hi>Epiphanius de Ponderib.

Simson's Chron. par. 7. p. 46 A<hi rend="sup">o</hi> Christi 67.</note> we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but see all that is here spoken from the beginning of the Chapter to the end of the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verse, to have been so fully made good by evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of fact, that there is no ground by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of this Prophecy, to look for any thing yet to be expected, which hath not been made good, as the Jews, that they may keep up themselves in their willing error of denying Christ yet to be come, would have us do: and that there is in them a full and satisfactory an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to that blasphemous murmuring and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioning in the last verse of the preceding Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter, <hi>God delighteth in them that do evil,</hi> else why doth he suffer them to prosper? or, <hi>Where is the God of Judgment</hi>? So that, in respect to those who so spake, and to whom these things were then spoken, <hi>viz.</hi> the people of the Jews, there is no need of looking farther. Mean while, what happened then to them is to all others for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xample, to teach them that though God for a while in his forbearance and giving time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, suffer the wicked to prosper, yet he will doubtless in due time manifest his Justice in punishing them for their evil doings; and if he do not in this life, whether by personal judgements on particular persons, or national on wicked Nations, yet he certainly will after death, and at that general terrible Judgement at the last day; of which that severe judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then on the Jewish Nation, was so lively a figure and emblem; as that it cannot but put all that will consider things in mind of it, and warn them to expect it, though it be not that which is here primarily meant. And this seems the most plain and the litteral way of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding these words, hitherto.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Even from the daies of your Fathers ye are gone away from mine Ordinances.</hi>] The connexion of these words with the former is by Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors differently given, according to their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Expositions of those. According to those that render the foregoing Verb in the notion of <hi>desisting</hi> or <hi>ceasing</hi> [from evil] these words will be a farther declaration of what was by it said, <hi>viz.</hi> that they continued still to do, as all along from the daies of their Fathers they had done, and would not be brought to repent of their evil doings and forsake them, which now yet they are exhorted to do, and in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words some of those their sins particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly enumerated.</p>
               <p>According to those who render it in the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>being consumed,</hi> and take it in the sense of the time past or present, they will be an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plification of Gods mercy in that they have not been, nor are yet consumed, by aggravation of their sins from their long and obstinate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in them without repentance of, or turning from them, which by the same un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable mercy they are called on yet to do. But according to the latter way (which we prefer) of rendring it <hi>ye shall not be consumed,</hi> there is not any such connexion to be looked after, but the former part of this Chapter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining an answer to what was, whether by impatient murmurers or s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>offers objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Gods justice and immutability of his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods in proceeding against wicked doers, being in the sixth verse concluded, he passeth to a <note n="x" place="bottom">Stock.</note> new matter, a distinct part of the Chapter, a new contest against the People of that time for other sins, by which they had provoked him to send on them already some previous judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; for removing which, and preventing those more terrible ones mentioned in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going verses, and which he doth again before the end of this Prophecy put them in mind of, he shews them the only way to be, to return unto him by repentance, and therefore in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion to them calls on them so to do.</p>
               <p>So <hi>R. Tanchum</hi> saith that though these words are not distinguished [from the former] in the writing, yet in sense they are, being an

address to the People of that time alone. So <hi>Junius</hi> 
                  <note n="y" place="bottom">Jun. Trem. on c.

So <hi>Grotius</hi> looks on it likewise as a distinct speech, saying that here leaving off to speak to whom he spake in the last words, he returns again to speak to the wicked. And according to this supposition, that here is a transition to a new matter of expostulation, without min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling this verse with the preceding, in constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or continuation of sentence, will be the plainest way of proceeding to what follows.</p>

                  <hi>Shamar</hi> is usually applied to negative Precepts: but without this nicety of distinction <hi>R. D. Kimchi</hi> gives the meaning in plain and perspicuous words, thus.

That here, while he mentions their doings, are intimated such evils and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as they had already pulled down on themselves, and should farther pull down if they continued in those waies, is manifest by what follows; as in the subsequent verses, where such evils are named, so in the next words of these, wherein he exhorts them to repentance, as the only means to remove what they already suffered, or were further threatned with, and to reconcile him whom they had provoked, to themselves, and regain his favor. <hi>Return unto me and I will return unto you.</hi> Return unto me by repentance, and I will return unto you in mercy and favor, and care over you, by my good Providence.

To this he returns them answer by specifying what besides those things they were guilty in, <hi>viz.</hi> in their defrauding him in tithes and offerings: and he so doth it, as to give them notice of the hainousness of that fault, saying,
<q>
                     <hi>8</hi> ¶ I Will a man rob God? yet ye have robbed me: But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes, and offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</q>

               <p>
                  <hi>Will a man rob God?</hi> &amp;c.] Of these words we find far different Translations, as 1. That of the ancient Latine, <hi>Si affiget homo Deum, quia vos configitis me,</hi> which the Authors of the <hi>Doway</hi> Translation in English, render, <hi>shall a man fasten God? because you do fasten me,</hi> with which though a harsh sense, the <hi>Tigurin</hi> Version also agrees; though noting in the Margin, that otherwise it may be rendred, <hi>do violence to,</hi> and <hi>pierce,</hi> and otherwise, <hi>take away by force,</hi> and that instead of God, may be rendred, <hi>Judicem, the Judge.</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, That of the Greek, <hi>will a man supplant God? because ye have supplanted me.</hi> And 3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> of the Chalde, <hi>will a man provoke a Judge to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger? because ye provoke me to anger.</hi> And 4, the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:33128:36"/>
Interlineary Version, <hi>Will a man take away God by force,</hi> (which must be understood of the things pertaining to God.) 5. <hi>Ought a man to snatch</hi> (or <hi>take away by rapine) those things that are Gods? because ye snatch away those things that are mine,</hi> as <hi>Pagnine.</hi> 6. As <hi>Munster, Will a man do violence to the Judges? because ye do vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to me.</hi>

               <p>That we may judge between these, and if there be any other that differs in sense from some of these, and clear the sense, it will be expedient to enquire into the signification of the principal Verb in this expression, because on the acception of that depends the main of the matter, either for preferring any of these before the other, or reconciling them, if it be possible. That word (or verb) rendred by ours, <hi>Rob,</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Kaba,</hi> of which we may observe, that it is found but seldom in the Scriptures, <hi>viz.</hi> here in this and the following verse four times, and in <hi>Prov.</hi> XXII. twice in the same verse, <hi>viz.</hi> the 23. verse, and not elsewhere, I mean in the form of a Verb, for to look after some Nouns which have the same radicals, which are but two neither, in Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <hi>Kubaath, Dregs,</hi> will not be much to our purpose. And this seldom use of it makes the signification not to be so well known as that of words oftner used. Diverse of the <note n="e" place="bottom">Abu Walid. R. Tanchum. R. Salomo. <hi>R.</hi> D. Kimchi. Abarbinel.</note> Jewish Grammarians and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters tell us that it signifies, <hi>to take away by violence, to rob</hi> (as ours well here express it) or to <hi>spoile,</hi> as in the forecited place, <hi>Prov.</hi> XXII.23. they render it: for in both places, <hi>viz.</hi> here and there, it seems to have the same signification. <note n="f" place="bottom">
                     <hi>R.</hi> Salomo.</note> Others looking on it as a Chalde or Syriack word, at least of more use in that Language, thence would have us take or look for the signification of it: and in that the most usual notion of it is, <hi>to fix,</hi> or <hi>fasten,</hi> to <hi>stick in,</hi> and the like. If this, as the learned <hi>Nicholas</hi> 
                  <note n="g" place="bottom">Capit. Concord. MS.</note> 
                  <hi>Fuller</hi> observes, be looked on as the primary signification, then because this is done by a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent percussion, or striking, the other which the Jews give of oppressing, or taking away by force, or robbing, may be looked on as a Metaphorical use of it, as agreeing in the act of violence or force with it. But however they fall in together in this common notion, I know not why that given by the Jews may not be thought as proper a signification of the word, when that Tongue florished in its latitude an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently among them; except we shall think the notion of <hi>doing violence,</hi> to have been the more general and ancient notion of it. Surely the places which it is found in, in the Hebrew Text, which we have cited, do seem to require some other signification then that of <hi>fixing</hi> or <hi>fastning.</hi> And the <hi>Doway</hi> Translators who here render it, <hi>fasten,</hi> in the parallel forecited place of <hi>Prov.</hi> XXII.23. render it <hi>pearse.</hi> And <hi>R. Salomo</hi> on that place, notes that in the Syriack Tongue it signifies also, to <hi>rob,</hi> as he proves by an example out of the <hi>Talmud.</hi> However these two, of <hi>robbing,</hi> or <hi>taking by violence from,</hi> and <hi>fastning,</hi> are the two main significations attributed to the word, to which all others given to it ought to be reduced, and what is spoken in exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it to be examined by.</p>
               <p>Now of these significations, the Jewish Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positors more generally follow that which, as we said, they give us, of <hi>violent, spoiling, taking from,</hi> or <hi>robbing.</hi> And so doth one of them, who translating this with the other Prophets into Arabick, renders it by <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Gasaba,</hi> which is <hi>violently to take away.</hi> But the Latin, as we see, follows the second, of <hi>fixing,</hi> or <hi>fastning</hi>; which yet divers of those Expositors which follow that, will not have to be understood properly of <hi>fastning,</hi> but rather of <hi>piercing</hi> and <hi>striking</hi> or <hi>sticking in</hi>; that so the meaning may be, that by sinning against God, as they did, they did, as it were, pierce and wound him, <hi>i. e.</hi> grieve and afflict him. So <note n="h" place="bottom">See Ribera, Chr. à Castro, Menoch. &amp; Tirin.</note> divers learned men that follow the Vulgar Latin, giving to the word a figurative signification. But if we were to follow this Translation, I should ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther choose to take the word <hi>fasten</hi> in a more proper notion, as it will denote, <hi>to restrain,</hi> as what is fastned is restrained, bounded, or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited, that it cannot go farther, and so is as it were shortned, or kept short, stinted and stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped.</p>
               <p>This notion may be illustrated out of the use of the word in the Arabick Tongue, wherein the root <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Ebn Athir, Kamus, &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>Kabaa</hi> signifies to <hi>shrink in,</hi> or <hi>pull,</hi> or <hi>put in,</hi> as when a Tortoise shrinketh his neck into his shell, or a man his head into his shirt, or garment, to hide it; and to turn in, as when one turneth in, or doubleth inward or outward the mouth of a Sack, or Bag. According to this notion, <hi>to fasten God,</hi> in respect to the matter of tithes and dues here spoken of, will be, to shorten that proportion that was due to him, to restrain and stop his allowance, and detain part of it from him, not giving the full of that which he by his Law required, nor in its due time, but limiting and bounding it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what they thought fit. And to this meaning seems <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> to incline, while he expounds it, to <hi>retain,</hi> or <hi>detain</hi> that which is due, which will also be confirmed by what follows, verse 10. <hi>Bring ye in all the tithes</hi>; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating that part of them were detained and stopped by them. And this being granted, these two Translations, <hi>will a man rob God?</hi> and <hi>will a man fasten God?</hi> though at first hearing they seemed very wide from one another, do meet in a middle notion of <hi>straitning,</hi> or <hi>restraining</hi>; he that detains ought of a mans allowance, that
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:33128:37"/>
pincheth (as we say) or shortens him in it, and doth not give him with a cheerfull eie his full due and proportion, doth rob him, as well as he that by force takes away from him what he hath. And so to fasten, or fix God to their allowance and stint him, not giving him his whole due, is to rob him.</p>
               <p>And so these two Expositions, which seemed most different, being brought thus far to agree, it will not be hard to reduce the rest to one of the forementioned significations. As for the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin or Modern Versions, it will be plain. The ancienter Greek rendring the Verb by <hi>supplant,</hi> seems to have taken it to have the same signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication with <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Akab</hi> (which consists of the same letters though otherwise transposed) to <hi>supplant, defraud,</hi> or <hi>deceive</hi> (whence <hi>Jacob</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Esau's</hi> interpretation, had his name, <hi>Gen.</hi> XXVII.36.) but it falls in well with the first signification, according to which the other Greeks render it more plainly, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, will a man defraud his God. The Chalde rendring it, by, <hi>provoke to anger,</hi> useth his liberty of a Paraphrast, rather then a litteral Translator, the provoking of God to anger being an effect of what they did, he expresseth the sin by its effect and consequents; and so in rendring <hi>Judges</hi> (wherein he is as we saw by some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers followed) what we and most others ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>God,</hi> taketh the word in a signification in which it is also used elsewhere in Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> to signify <note n="i" place="bottom">Ex. XXI.6.</note> 
                  <hi>Judges,</hi> who supply the place of God, and not only God himself.</p>
               <p>By this enquiry into the signification of that word which we proposed, have we not only discovered the grounds of the different Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of this place, but in part also shewed how they are between themselves more recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable then at first sight or hearing might be judged. By what hath been said will also easily appear, that among all there is not a more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient or justifiable rendring then that of ours, who translate it <hi>to rob,</hi> which will express where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they sinned in defrauding God, either by taking away or abridging and detaining what was due to him: And so from this necessary digression in looking into the signification of the words, return we to consider the scope of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Will a man rob God?</hi>] This question thus put serves not only to convince them, that they were guilty of the breach of Gods Ordinances, which they denied themselves to be, but shews together the greatness of the sin wherein they offended, as a thing which even the common consent of men, and their reason shewed most unfit to be done. Do ye not know that it is not fit that a man should rob his God? saith <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barbinel,</hi> his God, or Gods, for the word <hi>Elohim</hi> is the plural number, in which though it be usually spoken of the one true God, yet it is also other where so used as to comprehend also Idols and false Gods, such as men made and took to themselves in the place of God, though they were indeed no Gods. And <note n="k" place="bottom">Calvin.</note> some conceive, it ought here so to be taken, and that so there is a greater <hi>Emphasis</hi> in the words and force, for convincing them of great impiety, by shewing that they who knew and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the only true God, and pretended to serve him, did yet that towards him which any idolatrous, ignorant heathen would not dare, or offer to do toward their false Gods. Would any of them rob, or sacrilegiously defraud those whom they took, though falsely, to be Gods, of such dues, as under that notion of God, were looked on as belonging or due to them, though they were such as could do them no good? none of them, but would abhor it as a wicked thing. Ye therefore are worse and more wicked then any of them, for ye have robbed me, your Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor, from whom ye have all that ye have. They also who take (as we before said) <hi>God</hi> here for <hi>Judges,</hi> or great men, look on it as an argument concluding from the less to the greater. If men dare not, or will not, or ought not to provoke such persons as are in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity among them on Earth, by defrauding them of what is due to them, as it is plain they will not, or ought not; how much more ought you to beware of offending against me by robbing and defrauding me?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yet ye have robbed me.</hi>] Ye have done it, yet ye deny it? <hi>They said,</hi> or were, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved themselves as if they said, <hi>wherein have we robbed thee</hi>? seeing they will not perceive or acknowledge wherein they had done it, he particularly expresseth it to them, saying, <hi>In tithes and offerings,</hi> in that they detained, and did not duly and willingly bring in those dues, which he that gave them all that they had, did require, that they in acknowledgement of his bounty, should offer and return to him, as a portion by him reserved to himself for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the Priests and Levites, and such as waited on his service, and for the relief of the poor, out of such encrease of their Fields, and fruits of the Earth, and the like which he gave them. In detaining these from the Priests and Levites, to whom by his command they were to be given, and so robbing and defrauding them, they, he saith, robbed him himself. If they thought by this means to have <note n="*" place="bottom">Abarb.</note> any ease or greater store to themselves, being, as it appears by what follows, then under a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of famine or scarcity, he gives them to know that they are in this deceived, and their penury, not their store, shall be encreased by the continuance of his curse upon them, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the next words.</p>

                  <hi>Ye</hi> are <hi>cursed with a curse, for ye have robbed me,</hi> &amp;c.] The words thus read, give us the effect, and ill consequence of that their sin of robbing God in tithes and offerings, and so the coherence is plain, and is that, which by many, if not most, Expositors is followed; and will be all one as to that, whether it be read as by ours, and others, in the present tense, <hi>ye are cursed,</hi> as speaking of a curse already on them, or (as <hi>Grotius</hi> takes it) in the future, of a curse to come, or at least to be continued on them, <hi>ye shall be cursed; viz.</hi> for this your sin, even because ye have robbed me, great evils (such as appear to be in the following verses, <note n="l" place="bottom">So the Vulgar Latin <hi>Ye are cursed with penury.</hi>
                  </note> pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nury and scarceness) shall come upon you; as if he should say, because you have scanted me, I will scant you, and repay you in your own measure. But a late learned <note n="m" place="bottom">Lud. de Dieu.</note> man thinks the meaning to be mistaken in this rendring, and that to be put for the effect, which was indeed the cause of their robbing God, <hi>viz.</hi> that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they robbed him, because they were cursed with that curse of s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>arcity. He doth not (saith he) make the robbing of God the cause why they were cursed, but his curse the impulsive cause why they robbed God: For they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that it was not to be thought much that they detained the tithes and offerings; seeing they were forced to it, by reason of the want of the fruits of the Earth caused by the curse of God. But God required that though they had scarcity, and his curse were on them, yet they should bring in his full tithes of what they had, which if they did he promiseth to return and bless them. This exposition he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers before any, though he name another also, <hi>viz.</hi> by way of Interrogation, ye are cursed with a curse, and do ye rob me? <hi>i. e.</hi> Is it not a wonder that ye are not deterred by the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments which I have sent on you, but do rob me even when ye are cursed? or without an interrogation, ye are cursed, and yet ye rob me, even this whole Nation: as if he should say, I cannot but accuse you of great pervers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and stubborness, who when ye be cursed by me, go on to rob me, and that your whole Nation. This he saith, excepting against the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Translations and Expositions. But if we consider the words in respect to what precedes, we shall find them to comprehend what is by either said.</p>
               <p>In the second Chapter, <hi>v.</hi> 2. we hear God threatning to send a curse upon them, yea, telling them that he had already cursed them. The sins for which he there threatens them are manifest out of the foregoing Chapter, to have been their misbehavior in bringing their offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings to God, in that they offered polluted bread upon his Altar, and in that they brought to him, to whom the best of their substance was due, that which was torn, lame, sick, and corrupt. There was in that plainly a robbing of him, while detaining to themselves the best things which were due to him, they gave him only the worst, and that which they cared not for. And for that, he threatneth, if they would not amend it, to send a curse upon them; yea, tells them that the curse was already gone forth: they that would rob him in that kind, would not stick to rob him in others also, though not fully expressed till now, <hi>viz.</hi> in defrauding him by detaining their tithes and offerings, which here mentioning, he mentions again that curse by their evil dealing brought upon them, and tells them that it should not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, till they brought in all the tithes into the storehouse; so that we may conceive, the cause of the curse to have been their robbing him, and then the curse being a curse of scarcity and penury, that to have caused them, that they might make themselves whole, as much as they could, to detain what they should have given him, which he shews to have been a wrong course, and a farther cause to him of continuing the curse on them, which should not be removed but upon their amendment of their doings; so that, if it be asked what was the cause of the curse on them, we may say with ours and other Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that it was, their robbing of God: if, what was the cause that they pretended for their robbing of God, we may say with that learned man, that it was the penury or scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city which by the curse of God was brought on them: they pretended that his tithes and offerings would be more then they could spare out of that small store which he gave them, or their wicked thought (as if they stood on even terms with him) was, that seeing he had stinted and abridged them of what he was wont to give them, they would abbridge him of what they were commanded and ought to give him: If then it be further asked what was the effect of this their proceeding to rob him; that it was a continuance of his curse to them. So that though we look on what he saith as true, in respect of the cause which they pretended for the robbing of God, yet we cannot but according to what others say look on that their fraudulent dealing, as a cause provoking God to send his curse on them, and so to joyn both Expositions together. And in this the Jewish Expositors shew us the way. <hi>R. Salomo Jarchi</hi> thus expounds them,
<q>
                     <hi>Ye are cursed with a curse</hi> for this iniquity, because I send a curse on the works of your hands,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:33128:38"/>
and yet notwithstanding ye do rob me.</q>
                  <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> thus,
<q>Because ye say, <hi>How shall we give with a good eye</hi> (or cheerfully) <hi>out of this little?</hi> but this is not good (or well) that ye rob me, because of the curse and scarci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with which ye are cursed, and are in want; but this do, <hi>Bring in all the tithe, and I will pour upon you a blessing,</hi> &amp;c. that they should not give with an evil eye. By the curse you ought to have been corrected, (or amended) and not provoked to rob me.</q>
                  <hi>R. David Kimchi,</hi> thus,
<q>
                     <hi>Ye are cursed with a curse</hi>: for those transgressions which were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, as he said, <hi>yea, I have cursed you.</hi> Yet farther, still you do add ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity to iniquity, and ye rob me out of that which you gather, in that you do not give me of it the offering, and the tithes, and ye say he robbeth us of rain, and sends a curse on the fruits, and shall we give him the offering and the tithes?</q>
and lastly <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barbinel,</hi>
                  <q>Do ye think to get ease by deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to give to me the tithe and offering, as ye ought? the matter is not so, for for this ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity ye are cursed with a curse by me. Yet notwithstanding ye rob me, and so the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is become hurtful to you, and hurtful to the Levites and Priests.</q>
               </p>
               <p>What is added, <hi>even this whole Nation, R. David Kimchi</hi> thinks to intimate, that the whole Nation was not equally guilty of the other forementioned sins, but of this they were. <note n="n" place="bottom">See Dutch Notes, and Stokes.</note> Some joyn these words with the former words, thus, <hi>ye are cursed with a curse, even this whole Nation, because ye have robbed me</hi>: but the plainer construction seems that which ours fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, <hi>ye are cursed with a curse, and</hi> (or <hi>for) ye have robbed me, even this whole Nation,</hi> all of you have done it; joyning them with the immediatly preceding words. The sense will be much the same, and one infer the other, a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral sin and a general curse; so that these words will necessarily be referred to both, and shew both the extent of the sin, and of the curse, all the whole Nation being concerned in both. And for the punishment they repined, but did not repent of the sin, but rather more obstinatly went on in it, and thought to have stood it out with God; but they took not a right course herein, they could not by this get the better of God. If they would be eased of the curse, it must be by pacifying him, not by thinking to make themselves whole out of his part; and therefore he shews in the next words, what is the only way for them to take, even to amend in themselves their errour.</p>

So that by this means there was not sufficient maintenance for those who were to wait on his Service, the Priests and Levites, and were by that his due to have been main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, that without distraction they might attend on their office; this their doing is called robbing of God.</p>
               <p>For illustrating the things here said, it will be convenient to look on what we have of the History of those times recorded in the Book of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> in which we read, c. 5.3. <hi>that there was a great dearth among them.</hi> And this curse, here spoken of, seems to have been a present dearth or scarcity, not only one threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for the future: then <hi>c.</hi> XIII. <hi>v.</hi> 10, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that
<q>
                     <hi>Nehemiah</hi> found that the portions of the Levites had not been given them, so that they forsook their work, and fled every man to his field to get a livelyhood.</q>
And the occasion of this appears to be, because all the tithes were not paid, for so upon <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> contending with the Rulers about it, it is said, <hi>v.</hi> 12. <hi>Then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn, and the new wine and the oyl into the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suries, or storehouses,</hi> as in the margin, and as here translated; the word being in both the same, denoting such a room as was at the Temple appointed for the laying up of those things brought in, as <note place="bottom">See cap. X.38.</note> 
                  <hi>v.</hi> 5. of that XIII. ch. is
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:33128:38"/>
described, <hi>viz.</hi> a great room, or rooms, where they laid the meat offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the corn, the new wine, and the oyl, which was command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be given to the Levites, and the Singers, and the Porters, and the offerings of the Priests. But those things were not duly given to them as it appears by reason of the Peoples defect in bringing them in. <hi>Grotius</hi> thinks that the sin, here found fault with, was, that whereas out of the <hi>Terumah</hi> or offering mentioned, <hi>Deut.</hi> XVIII.4. and such other gifts as were due to the Priests, they ought to have main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the daily Sacrifices; they either did it not at all, or in such illegal fraudulent manner as is reproved in the first Chapter, and that the Priests took the whole tithes to themselves, and did not give to the Levites what ought to have been distributed to them, <hi>viz.</hi> nine parts of them, and that the whole Nation became guilty in robbing God, because that when they saw the Levites were not maintained out of the tithes, they abstained from bringing them, and so God was robbed; both because such things were not performed to him, for which the offerings were given, and because the Levites were not maintained, as they ought to be, but forsook his Service for want of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stenance, and so he was deprived of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry.</p>
               <p>But neither here, nor in <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> is any thing specified in these kinds, but only the People accused for not bringing in all their tithes, by which failure in them, there was not meat in his house, <hi>i. e.</hi> maintainance, for his Altar and those that ministred at it, and did Service in his House, whether Priests or Levites. For which sin he is angry with them, and commands it here to be redressed by the whole Nation, which were all guilty, by their bringing in all the tithes into the storehouse; and so in <hi>Nehemiah</hi> it is said that that zealous Governour caused all <hi>Judah</hi> to do, and that he then set treasurers over the treasuries, to see them distributed as they ought. How long before that was done, this was spoken by the Prophet, the History of the Scripture doth not make clear. But herein do these two Books well agree, in that both here and there a dearth is spoken of: and as here the People are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved for robbing God in tithes and offerings, so there it is testified that they did detain them; and whereas, here they are exhorted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress that sin, by bringing them all duly in, for removing the curse that was on them; so there we <note n="p" place="bottom">In the forecited place, and in ch. X.35, 36, &amp;c.</note> read that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> prevailed on them so to do, as perceiving that there was no other way for averting Gods wrath from them. What was the issue on their doing so, the History doth not proceed so far as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, but here in the Prophet we have assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that if with a willing and pious mind they should do so, it should be good; God would remove the curse, and abundantly bless them. If they would be so just to God, and kind to themselves as to put it to the trial, by but doing what they ought to do, they should find that God would not fail in any measure of his Promise, but would on their obedience do more for them then by vertue thereof they might ordinarily expect. This he gives assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of in the next words, <hi>And prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of Hosts, if I will not open you the windows of Heaven,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The connexion of these words with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer verse, and the meaning of them, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise with the following, <hi>Abarbinel</hi> thus gives, [And if ye shall say that this curse on the fruits of the Earth, is not because of this, but that it is an accident to you, come now let us make a trial, <hi>Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse,</hi> as much as if he should say, give the tithes and offerings in full measure, and with a good eye, and bring them into the Lords storehouse, <hi>that there may be meat, i. e.</hi> sustenance, and maintainance for the Ministers of my House, the Priests and Levites, and prove me now by this.

But however this rule may be elsewhere appliable, here seems to be no need of it. According to those here is a stop made after, <hi>prove me now here with,</hi> and a distinct member of the sentence to begin. But read all, as in our Translation and others in a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued sense, and the meaning is plain without any such supply, or any abruptness, in the speech, as if he should say, you, in doing what you do, take a wrong course; neither your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining my dues, nor murmuring against my justice, shall any thing prevail for good or help to you in this curse of penury, under which ye suffer; but if you will find relief, do what I prescribe to you, <hi>Bring in all your tithes,</hi> &amp;c. and thereby <hi>prove me</hi> whether I will not quickly remove the curse, by giving all necessary causes and means of a contrary blessing. And so it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a Promise, that he will do it, they shall certainly find it; <note n="s" place="bottom">Compare Hag. II.15. and forwards.</note> and that the parting with that which they detained, as fearing the parting therewith, should diminish their store, shall be a way, the only way for great encrease of it.</p>
               <p>To this purpose <hi>R. D. Kimchi</hi> explains the words,
<q>
                     <hi>Bring in all your tithes,</hi> &amp;c. that there may be meat for those that serve me, and withall repent you of the faults mentioned; if ye do not, I will punish you with other punishments; but if you do bring in all the tithes and offerings as ye ought, I will give you rain, and pour out on you a blessing.</q>

               <p>
                  <hi>Pelicanus</hi> a learned and serious man in this Exposition follows him, who also from what is here said, with great reason urgeth on Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians under the Gospel, a diligent care of due and willing paying such tithes and oblations, as are for the maintainance of the Ministry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As likewise <note n="t" place="bottom">On ver. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Oecolampadius,</hi> saying, that Christian liberty exempteth none from tithes that were wont to be paid.

It was a manifest testimony al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to all Nations of his divine power, and so acknowledged; so that it will not be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to look into those many places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, wherein he speaks of it as so, either by promising to give it for a blessing, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain it for a curse and punishment.</p>
               <p>When he restrains it, he is in a figurative speech said <hi>to shut up Heaven,</hi> as <hi>Deut.</hi> XI.17. and <hi>Luc.</hi> IV.25. and to <hi>stop the windows of Heaven, Gen.</hi> VIII.2. equivalent to which is another expression of <hi>making the Heaven brass, Deut.</hi> XXVIII.23. and <hi>staying it, Hag.</hi> I.10.

Which way soever it be intended, there is no doubt but that the expression is (as <hi>Aben Ez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> notes) a proverbial phrase for signifying <note n="y" place="bottom">Compare 2 Kings 7.19.</note> great abundance: and because abundance thereof may be (as we said) as well for a curse

at sometimes, as a blessing at others; and it is in the disposal of God to order for which it shall be, to shew that his Promise here is for good, he adds, <hi>and pour you out a blessing, viz.</hi> of plenty, contrary to their present condition of penury. Both the rain, and the making it a blessing, is from him and his ordering. And he saith of that blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it. So according to our Translation; and so (as we already noted from <hi>Abarbinel) R. D. Kimchi</hi> (reporting it as from his Father) saith that the meaning is, <hi>in such plenty that you shall not have vessels,</hi> or storehouses sufficient <hi>to receive it.</hi> The words in the original are concise <gap reason="foreign">

But for the completing to them a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing contrary to the curse under which they suffered, it would not be sufficient that they should have rain and fruitfull Seasons; these might make the Earth yeild her encrease, and bring forth in plenty all manner of grain and fruits, and yet they by other means be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of them, as by Locusts, Canker-worms, Catter-pillars, and the like devouring creatures, which God calls his <hi>great Army, Joel</hi> II.25. which in a short time oft have destroyed the hope of the whole year, and occasioned great famines, when there hath been expectation of greatest plenty; and probably these were part of that curse now upon them. For perfecting therefore the blessing here promised on their amendment of their waies, he promiseth also to secure them from these, and all hurt by them, saying, <hi>I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes,</hi> (or to, or for you) <hi>i. e.</hi> that all things may prosper to you. <hi>The devourer</hi>; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there were many sorts of such creatures, as may devour and corrupt the corn and fruits, he puts a general name that comprehends all; all of them will he <hi>rebuke, i. e.</hi> hinder from doing hurt. They are wont to do hurt, not only to the fruits of the ground, the corn and herbage, but to the fruit-trees also, by causing them also not to be able to bring any fruit to perfection, as appears by <hi>Joel</hi> I.7. according to what some there expound the words. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that place be understood, the thing is known and manifest, and therefore both <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> and the <hi>Tigurin</hi> Latin Version, instead of what ours render, <hi>neither shall your Vine cast her fruit before the time in the Field,</hi> &amp;c. trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late it, neither shall he (<hi>i. e.</hi> the devourer) make your Vine barren (or unfruitful to you in the Field,) and to that doth that Exposition of <hi>Abarbinel</hi> (which we have seen) seem to encline.

This way also <hi>Montanus</hi> commends, though not mentioning whom he follows in it.

He therefore to shew that he knew, both what was in their mouths and hearts, and to convince them of their guiltiness in that which he accuseth them of, answers them by a particular declaration of what they said.

These are the words, or thoughts of those unsound ones in their Religion, and unsincere in their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise, who, looking on what they saw at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and not on what should certainly in due time be made manifest for clearing Gods Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, and his perpetual love to good, and hatred of evil, did hence take occasion of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioning whether there were any just Judge or judgement: and of repining and murmuring against Gods ordering of the affairs of men, and so of contemning and setting at nought what was by the Prophets, reprooving them for their sins, and calling them to repentance for removing such judgements as were on them, or preventing of others, said unto them. Who they were that said these words, and when they said them, and concerning whom, is not particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly expressed. <hi>R. Tanchum</hi> therefore, as he did also, c. 2.17. looks upon them as representing words which should in time to come be spoken by <hi>Israel</hi> in captivity, such at least, as if they did not speak or profess, yet might seem to have occasion to do it. And that they are here recited for reproof to them that should be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient under the length of their captivity, and forsake their Religion, and speak thus in respect to what they should perceive of the prosperity of heathenish Nations notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing their impiety: to which is added in the following words a declaration, that those that endure patiently and stick to the truth, shall in the end be rewarded in the best man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as in the two following verses, <hi>Then they that feared the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. and then is added a mention likewise of the punishment of those that are not so affected, and the punishment of the wicked injurious Nations also, (as he saith <hi>v.</hi> 18. and <hi>c.</hi> 4.1. <hi>then shall ye return and discern between the righteous and the wicked,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven,</hi> &amp;c.) But as to the former part of his words, it cannot be made out of what is here spoken, as neither out of the last verse of the second Chapter, but is destructive to the right meaning of them.</p>
               <p>The words being directed to them that were returned from the Babylonish captivity, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly concern the behaviour of them now again settled in their Country, which was not such as it ought to have been, and therefore they are reproved for it; that which is here obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to them, appears to have been a sin of impatience and blasphemy against God, and his Providence and Justice, of which too many or most of them were guilty; yet not all, for while the discontented ones among them spake thus impiously of God and his Justice, there were others that feared the Lord, and spake among themselves otherwise, as is manifest by the next words. But he seems to mean it of the time of the captivity, that they are now under, and a future Judgement yet to come, wherein he is manifestly wide of the matter, and passing over the times of the Prophet, and the present People of which he spake, trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers the words to such times as they do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly concern, times now present and yet to come: and taking no notice of that day of the Lord, which was here prophesied of, as then indeed to come, but which is long since come, would have another yet on earth to be expected, if the Lord, the Messiah, whose coming was that day, were not yet come, which is the common error of the Jews, which hath been already discovered, and will in considering the following words be farther discovered if God permit.</p>
               <p>As for what, therefore, is spoken by way of reproof and comfort, it must be applyed to the right persons concerned therein, which doubtless were in the first place those of that
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:33128:41"/>
present time, and then such as should succeed them betwixt that and the destruction of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi> by the Romans; the completion of that day of the Lords coming, both before, ver. 2. and after c. IV.1. spoken of. Those at that present for the most part of them murmured against Gods Justice, in the manner here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, yet, then mean while (as it follows in the next verse,) they that feared the Lord <note n="v" place="bottom">See Calv.</note> hearing what the Prophet said, <hi>spake often one to another.</hi> The word, <hi>often,</hi> is not expressed in the Hebrew, and therefore the words are by others rendred, only <hi>spake one to another.</hi> But our Translators thought good to supply it, as being included in the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Nidbaru,</hi> according to what we have seen to be observed by some of the force of the Verb in this form on ver. 13. What they spake is not here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, except we render it otherwise, as <note n="x" place="bottom">Jun.

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Vayaksheb, and the Lord hearkned,</hi> is wrested to another signification. It is more easy to understand it thus to be meant, that as the wicked spake much among themselves, so these also did, but contrary things; they against Gods Justice, <note n="z" place="bottom">See R.

               </p>
               <p>But before we proceed to those words, we may here take notice that as <hi>Abarbinel</hi> (as we shewed) differs in the understanding of this word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Nidbar,</hi> in the 13. verse, so here he goes much more wide from them, taking it in clean another signification from that which he himself gave it there, and others both here and there give it. For here he would have the words rendred, as continued with the former, and part of what those blasphemers, before mentioned, said, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>then they that feared the Lord were destroyed,</hi> from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other signification that the same root hath, and is used in, as in other places according to him and some others. So in II <hi>Chron.</hi> XXII.10. <gap reason="foreign">

Thus far he would have the words of those that spake against Gods Justice to reach, and then the following words, <hi>the Lord hearkned,</hi> &amp;c. to be an answer from the Prophet to them; as if he should say to them, Know and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that to all this that you say, God hearkneth and heareth it, and that both the righteousness of the righteous, and the wickedness of the wicked are as manifest before him, as if all were written in a book of remembrance, that it might remain many daies, till the time of due recompence and reward, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the same way of Exposition with him doth <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> follow, and gives it as his own conjecture or opinion, probably having seen <hi>Abarbinel,</hi> else he would scarce have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len in so fully with him here, as he doth in many other places, without mentioning him in Expositions singular to them: and this he commends as most agreeable to the words, but I see no reason to be of his opinion, but choose rather to follow that interpretation which our Translation, with the most both of Jews and Christians, gives, not making these first words a part of those stout words which the wicked spake against God, but a declaration of the behaviour of those that feared God; and the following, of the good consequence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So <hi>R. D. Kimchi</hi> perspicuously expounds them and the following.
<q>The former words were the saying of those who did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the waies of the Lord and his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and when those that feared the Lord heard those words from those men, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed the Providence of God over these things below, they spake one with another and multiplyed, or often repeated those words, and argued the matter, till they found by their understanding, that all his <note n="a" place="bottom">Deut. XXXII.4.</note> waies are judgement, that he is a <hi>God of truth and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out iniquity. And the Lord hearkned, i. e.</hi> God blessed for ever attended to their words, and gave them their reward for this. <hi>And a book of remembrance was written before him,</hi> a proverbial expression according to the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of men, among whom Kings write a book of memorials; (for there is no forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness with God,) according to what is said, <hi>blot me out of thy Book, Exod.</hi> XXXII.32. and <hi>every one that shall be found written in the book, Dan.</hi> XII.2.</q>

to follow. And it is that wherein most both Jewish and Christian Expositors do well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; as likewise in what is meant by what he saith, <hi>and the Lord hearkned and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written, viz.</hi> that the Lord took due notice of what was said, (both by bad and good, say <note n="b" place="bottom">See Chr. à Castro, Menoch. Tirin.</note> some; which though it be true that he doth so, yet here more particularly it seems to be referred to the good,) and kept it in perpetual remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, in the register of his memory, if we may so speak, as certainly as if it were written in a book, according to the custome of men <note n="c" place="bottom">See Ester, VI.1, &amp;c.</note>, who note down in writing, or cause to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistred, such things as they would not forget, but be sure to call to mind, and shew that they took due notice of, as meet occasion and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity should serve; to reward those that had done them any service or deserved well, or whom they had a mind to do good to. Of Gods book, and things being written in it, there is we know often mention in the Scriptures, besides those places which <hi>Kimchi</hi> recites, both in the Old and New Testament; and every where is much alike to be understood, <hi>viz.</hi> that the things spoken of are as surely known, and had in remembrance with him, as if they were written down before him. And so where the books are said to be opened, it is the making manifest his knowledge of those things, by his passing sentence on men accordingly for good or bad: see <hi>Dan.</hi> VII.10. and <hi>Revel.</hi> XX.12. and <hi>Isa.</hi> LXV.6.</p>
               <p>The book of remembrance, is here said to be <hi>written for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon his name, viz.</hi> to give them assurance that their faithfulness to him, <note n="d" place="bottom">R. Solomo.</note> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he did not presently reward them openly for it, yet was duly taken notice of by him, and in due time he would make it known by his distinguishing them from the wicked, and his great care of them to preserve them from those heavy judgements, and that destruction which should seize on the others, as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the following words.</p>
               <p>But before we pass to them, we may take notice of what is by some observed concerning the signification or force of that word which is rendred, <hi>and that thought upon his Name, viz.</hi> that it imports not a bare thinking of, but a due esteem and awful regard of, so as with all care to avoid all things that may tend to the dishonor of it; constantly to endeavor so to walk as beseems such who profess to know God and to serve him, as alwaies in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and with respect to him, and fear of him. Those, saith <hi>Kimchi,</hi> are meant who alwaies think of, or meditate in the waies of the Lord, and the knowledge of his God-head, for his Name is himself, and he (himself) is his Name. <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> understands it of the wise in heart, who know the secret (or the mystery) of the glorious awfull Name. He seems to allude to what is said, <hi>Psal.</hi> XXV.14. <hi>the secret of the Lord is with them that fear him. R. Tanchum</hi> saith that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Choshebe</hi> rendred <hi>that thought on,</hi> imports or includes honoring and magnifying; according to the use of the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Chashub,</hi> for one in dignity and high esteem: so that it may be expounded, such as knowing the secret of that glorious awful Name, do accordingly magnify it. The Greek, <hi>that reverence his Name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It will not be any great digression to look a little back, and see how the Greek renders the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Nidbaru,</hi> of which we have already spoken, because they seem to differ from the Latin and other Translations, rendring it, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which usually signifies to <hi>mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure</hi> or <hi>speak against,</hi> or <hi>to speak of with dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. These things</hi> (saith that Translation) <hi>murmured they, that feared the Lord.</hi> So that S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> to give their sense, saith that they took the words <hi>they that feared the Lord</hi> Ironi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, <hi>viz.</hi> for such as made shew of so doing, but did not truly and really fear him; and so to belong still to those who spake those stout words before mentioned: except we should think that they took it, as if even the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous were, by what they saw of the prosperity of the wicked, moved to speak otherwise, then they ought, of Gods Justice and Providence, as the Psalmist by the same consideration was, as he confesseth, almost moved sometimes to do, <hi>Psal.</hi> LXXIII.2, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But besides this signification it hath another given it, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <note n="e" place="bottom">Steph. Lex.</note> 
                  <hi>to speak much,</hi> to <hi>overwhelm with speaking,</hi> to speak one down, as we may say, which if it be here taken, and may be used in a good sense, only for much and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest speaking, then will it be but the same which our Translation gives, and some as we have seen observe to be the import of the word, <hi>viz.</hi> that those that feared God, hearing what others impiously spake, derogatory to Gods Justice, did in zeal to his Glory speak much and often, and earnestly one to another in vindication of it, and to cry down the folly of those blasphemous ones, and <note n="f" place="bottom">R.

But whatever may be thought of this the plainest meaning will be that which we have given, agreeably to our own Translation, and that way which most Expositors (as we have said) take; and according to that way have we a clear passage to the next verse, wherein the Lord having assured them that their words are had in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, and their reward with him in due time to be manifested; he proceeds farther to declare it, and to assign a certain time of it.</p>

Vulgar Latin, (not as the <hi>Doway</hi> Version ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, <hi>in the day that I do to my peculiar.</hi>) The same way others take; and that so those words should be rendred by themselves inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely, <hi>viz. in the day which I make</hi> (or shall make,) or wherein I do, (<hi>i. e.</hi> will certainly do.) And the word <hi>peculiar</hi> not governed of that just in place before it, <hi>viz. do or make</hi>; but be referred to the foregoing, <hi>viz. they shall be to me,</hi> may be confirmed by their coming again in the same manner, <hi>c.</hi> IV.3. <hi>in the day that I shall do or make,</hi> without any thing added after it. Yet doth the ancient Syriack Version make the last word to be governed of that imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly preceding it, as ours do, though ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring that otherwise then ours, <hi>viz. a congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, they shall be mine in the day when I shall make a congregation.</hi> So the Latin Translator points it, although possibly by otherwise di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing the words, it might be rendred, <hi>they shall be to me in the day, which I make, a congregation. R. Salomo Jarchi</hi> seems to give an Exposition different from all these, to this purpose,
<q>In the day which I make a reserved treasure, <hi>i. e.</hi> which I have treasured and laid up with me, therein to perform (or pay) my recompence.</q>
And if it were so understood, the expression would agree with that, <hi>Act.</hi> I.7. wherein speaking of those times, in which they expected that Christ should restore the Kingdom to <hi>Israel,</hi> he calleth them <hi>times and seasons which God had put in his own power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But whatever differences may be betwixt Expositors, as to the rendring the words, the day in them spoken of is still the same, <hi>viz. the day of the Lords coming,</hi> mentioned before in this Chapter, in the second, third, and fifth verses, and again in the following Chapter, in the first, second, and third verses; namely, the day wherein God should execute his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the Nation of the Jews, for work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing revenge upon his enemies, and redemption to those that fear him, and revere his Name. Though such discrimination shall be fully made between all the godly and the wicked at Christs second coming, the general day of Judgement, (to which, therefore, what is here spoken is by <note n="m" place="bottom">See Chr. à Castro.</note> divers referred,) yet certainly here what is said, respects more particularly the Nation of the Jews, and the time of that nationall judgement denounced against them. What hath been before said, and what is here said, and what shall be after said in this Prophecy, will not be so properly applied, and clearly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood by applying it to any other: mean while may the words well be accommodated, to any other People with whom it shall be so, at any time, as it was then with the Jews, and whom God shall in like kind visit with a national judgement or excision; <note n="n" place="bottom">See D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Hammond on Mat. XIII.49.</note> what to them happened being to others for example, and likewise to that great day of discrimination, the day of the general judgement; yea, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to the day of death, as for what concerns particular men; but still those whom the words seem properly to concern as here spoken to, and of, are the Nation of the Jews, then in being in their own Country, a Nation sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from others, and bearing then the name of the <hi>Lords People.</hi> In that day when the Lord shall do such things, he will shew by making a manifest difference, who are his, and who are not his: his shall be separated from the rest as his own <note n="o" place="bottom">R. D. Kimchi.</note> peculiar, from such as he will not own nor regard; and when he exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteth judgement in fury on others, <hi>he will spare them,</hi> and keep them that those evils which destroy the wicked shall not touch them, <hi>as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These words are a farther declaration of Gods exceeding great favor, and compassion to those whom he would own, and look on as his peculiar, in terms of greatest elegance and height of expression. The compassionate affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a Father is great to any child, though he be unprofitable to him, yea hurtful to him; how much more when he is profitable to him, and honoreth him? so notes <hi>R. Tanchum,</hi> and to the same purpose <hi>Kimchi,</hi> and other Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitors <note n="p" place="bottom">Rib. Drus. Tarn. &amp;c.</note> also. There is another thing also here, by <note n="q" place="bottom">Pelic. &amp; Calv.</note> some taken notice of in the expression, which may well be added, as making for the amplification of Gods goodness, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation of those that fear and honor him, <hi>viz.</hi> that he saith <hi>he will spare them,</hi> which imports that though there be found in them defects, and they have done and spoken things that they ought not, and which in rigor of Justice might deserve punishment, yet as long as their hearts are right with him, and they sincerely honour and obey him, and have reverent thoughts of him, he will forgive their trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions, and in great mercy save them, when he will shew no mercy to the wicked, but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their deserts in severity deal with them.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>18</hi> Then shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God, and him that serveth him not.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then shall ye return and discern between,</hi> &amp;c.] Then, when that day shall come, such an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of things shall there be, that though you now think all things go alike to all, or rather for the worse to those that most serve God, yet then you shall change your minds, and discern that God did alwaies observe the actions of men, and put a difference between
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:33128:43"/>
the righteous and the wicked, those that served him, and those that served him not; though till now he did not make it so apparent to men of corrupt judgements.</p>
               <p>Some difference here is betwixt Interpreters in rendring, and expounding these words, <note n="r" place="bottom">Grotius.</note> some following a reading that is in some Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of the Vulgar Latin, (<hi>viz. &amp; convertimini, and be converted,</hi> or <hi>return</hi>) give us to take it as an exhortation to these wicked ones who spake blasphemously of Gods Justice to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn and repent: and then they should discern that distinction between the righteous and the wicked, which they would not now perceive. And with this reading the <hi>Tigurin</hi> 
                  <note n="s" place="bottom">And Munster.</note> Version also agrees; so it will sound, <hi>now therefore return, &amp;c.</hi> to which will be reduced also that Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of <hi>Pelican, If ye shall repent, ye shall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern.</hi> Others following another reading, which <note n="t" place="bottom">Ribera.</note> some observe to be more correct, and indeed comes closer to the Letter in the Original, though that admit of both; <hi>viz. &amp; convertemini; and ye shall return,</hi> or be converted, understand it of the late and bootless repentance of those blasphemers, <note n="u" place="bottom">See Lyra.</note> or a conversion which they shall be forced to, by what they shall then, nill they, will they, necessarily discern and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of the <note n="x" place="bottom">See Wisd. 5.1. &amp;c.</note> different condition of those that serve God, and those that serve him not.

Now all these look on the words as directed to the wicked, who thought it vain to serve God, as if he took no notice of what was done by men, spoken to <hi>vers.</hi> 13, 14, 15. <note n="a" place="bottom">Pet. à Fig.</note> There are who think, they may be taken as directed to those that feared the Lord, next before spoken of, as if the meaning were, that such a change of things should be, that though now they could not perceive any difference betwixt themselves and the wicked, yet then looking on what was come to pass, they should evidently discern it, and perceive Gods especial care over them, and that so here is a change of the person, which is not unfrequent in the Scriptures: for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as before they were spoken of, in the third person, they are here spoken to in the second. But without nicer enquiry into the persons spoken to, and the nature of the conversion or returning here mentioned, of whom, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther true or false, it may suffice as to the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to take the scope of the <note n="b" place="bottom">See Calvin. and Sanctius.</note> words, to be as at first we intimated, That such a conversion turning, or change, shall then in that day be in the face of things, that all, both the godly and the ungodly looking thereon, shall neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily see that there is no place for doubting of Gods Justice, in his ordering of things for the punishment of the wicked, and preservation of the righteous, and that he alwaies doth put a distinction between them, though to men judging by the present outward appearance of things, it is not alwaies so apparent. It shall be made beyond all doubt apparent in that day. By this, saith <note n="c" place="bottom">Edit. Steph. in folio.</note> 
                  <hi>Vatablus,</hi> he points out the future Resurrection; and so think <note n="d" place="bottom">Oecolamp.</note> others, as well Christians as Jews, as expresly <note n="e" place="bottom">The last page but one of his Comment. on the Prophets.</note> 
                  <hi>Abarbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,</hi> who therefore interprets this returning of the souls of men, returning to their bodies at that day; which the thing in it self is true, as to a general distinction between all the righteous, and all the wicked that ever were, or shall be in this World. At the resurrection of the dead, and the general Judgement, there shall be an apparent difference made between them, and the one separated from the other, though be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this World mingled one with another, as when <hi>a Shepheard divideth his Sheep from the Goats, Mat.</hi> XXV.32. and we willingly grant that the words point at that day, so as to put us in mind of it, and warn us to think there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But we do not look on that as the primary and proper scope of this Prophecy, but that it describes to us in the first place, and as its main intent, that national judgement which God threatned to the Jews, and accordingly executed on them in this World, shortly after the first coming of Christ, or at his coming; that word including all that time from his first preaching to the destruction of <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> That was the day in which the distinction here spoken of was to be made, and accordingly was si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnally made, as hath been already said, and will be in looking into the next Chapter, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is both the certainty of the coming of that day, and the nature or manner of it more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared, and described in Prophetical ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions: in finding the true meaning of which, as well as of the present words, as to the words and signification of them, we may still make use of the Jewish Expositors, but not as to the sense and intent. For that day to be meant, which we say, agreeably to the words and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of the times also, is meant, they must by no means grant. That those things belong to the time yet to come, and are to be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, either at a restauration of <hi>Israel,</hi> and subduing their enemies, at the coming of their

fancied Messias, which with much earnestness they long for, or at the day of Judgement, or to particulars at the day of death, they will tell us; but that they were fulfilled (as mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly they were) at that long since past de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of their Nation, and holy City, and Temple, they must obstinatly deny, or else they must grant and acknowledge as we do, that Christ is already come; in opposing and denying which the whole of their Religion now consists. This therefore in their expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Prophecy are they silent of, as if no such thing had been. This here spoken (saith <hi>Aben Ezra</hi>) was spoken to the men of that generation, because this is the end of all the Prophecies. So say we too: for after <hi>Malachi</hi> was no other Prophet sent to the Jews, till <hi>John Baptist,</hi> Christs forerunner, and what is said therefore concerned them, the People of the Jews then being, and all their posterity, till that time that this Prophecy was fulfilled (as by succession still one People) to warn them by repentance to prevent the judgement threatned and declared for that end to them, <note n="f" place="bottom">2 Pet. 3, 9. and see Mat. XXIII.34, &amp;c. and Luke XIII.34.</note> by the great mercy, and <hi>long suffering</hi> of God, <hi>not willing that any should perish, but all should come to repentance.</hi> But seeing the generality of them would not be brought to repentance, nor know the things belonging to their peace, in that their day, as Christ complains of them, <hi>Luc.</hi> XIX.42, 44. the judgment was, so as here descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, then in Gods appointed time executed, and such a distinction and discrimination, as is here spoken of, visibly to all the World made, in the preservation of such among that People who feared God, and beleived in Christ, and the destruction of his enemies.</p>

                  <hi>FOR behold the day cometh,</hi> &amp;c.] The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion and necessary coherence of these words with the former, as being, as we said, a declaration of the certainty of the coming of that day in them spoken of, and a description of it, is so apparent as that it may seem no reason why they should be severed from them, and made the beginning of a new Chapter, and therefore by some are continued with them. But we need not much insist on this, the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Chapters not interrupting the sense. As to the scope of them it is well given by a learned <note n="a" place="bottom">Grot. and see Tarn. and Stokes.</note> man, <hi>viz.</hi> that they are a description of the final Judgement on the Jews (in their destruction) and an image of representation of the last general Judgement on all Mankind. That was certainly then to come on the Jews (if not prevented by their repentance, as it was not,) when the Prophet then spake this, but is long since come; this is yet still to come, but shall in Gods appointed time, as certainly come, as if it were already present. Of both, therefore, it might then be said; <hi>Behold the day cometh, i. e.</hi> shall certainly come, and the description is so full of terror, as that it may well be applied both to the one and to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet certainly was it that former, which the primary intention of the Prophet was here to describe, and to the latter are the words appliable only by way of accommodation. For to the Nation of the Jews did he then speak, as a Messenger peculiarly sent to them, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them for their sins, and declare to them, such things as concerned them, and not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly such things as were common to the whole World, though what things happened to them were ensamples to all other People: and like judgements on like behavior they may justly expect in this World also, besides that last general Judgement which shall involve all, both Jews and other Nations, which (<hi>viz.</hi> to what People the Prophet was peculiarly sent, and spake, and when) they did not seem to consider who passing over what befell the Jews, according to this Prophecy, expound these words, as primarily and properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to that last general Judgement (and taking in too the particular judgement of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:33128:44"/>
men at their death, as some will,) as many do.</p>
               <p>'Tis the consent (saith <note n="b" place="bottom">Ribera.</note> one) of Jews and Christians, that it should be so expounded of the day of Judgement. Why the Jews must in their own defence and maintainance of their other opinions so expound it, or else of some other time yet to come, hath been already shewed; but why Christians should therein consent with them, there is no reason, yea much to the contrary, that they may not thereby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm them in their error, as if Christ were not yet come. Yet what might move some Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians so to do, we shall perhaps have occasion to see, when we come to the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verse. Mean while we take that which we have given, <hi>viz.</hi> that this concerns primarily that national judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the Jews, not many years after Christs coming, (about 40. after his death) executed by the Romans, the instruments of Gods wrath on them, in that terrible destruction of their City and People, to be the truest and most proper way of expounding the words; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that shall proceed: However by way of accommodation allowing them to be applied, either to the particular or general Judgement, to be expected by all other men. And though we cannot consent with the Jews in their opinion, yet may we take notice of some things that they say for illustrating our own; or for shewing the incongruity of their opinion, or for enquiry into the signification and literal meaning of some of the words. And by the way we say, that what is said that the Jews all consent in this, that the peculiar day here designed is the day of the last general Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is spoken but at large. For indeed they do not agree in it, as <hi>Abarbinel,</hi> who doth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self say that it is meant of the time of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection and the day of Judgement, plainly sheweth in his Commentary on this place, and seeketh to prove that some do agree with him in it, but confesseth that others of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors do not, who refer it to the punishment that seizeth on the soules of the wicked im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly after death, and that others speak so obscurely that it cannot be positively said of what time they understood it, whether of the restauration of <hi>Israel</hi> which they look for, or of the resurrection of the Dead. So that all that can be said, that they consent in, is, that they do not expound it of that day which we do, as their interest leads them, as we have said, to do, though among themselves not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing in one opinion, and all erring from the right.</p>
               <p>Nor do all Christians neither agree among themselves in the matter. <note n="c" place="bottom">Tarn. Grot. and Stokes.</note> Some of good note and learning going the way that we take; with whom we may rank <note n="d" place="bottom">Arias Mont. &amp; Calv.</note> others also, who inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret the place, not of Christs second coming at the end of the World, but of his first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, though they perhaps extend not that name of his coming so far as we do, but in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications of it, expound it rather of his preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, while he was on Earth, by which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced those hypocrites of their impiety, not sparing their sins, while they do not expresly mention his terrible Judgements executed on the Jews in the destruction of <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> 
                  <note n="e" place="bottom">See Assembly's Annotat. and Tarnov.</note> Those also dissent from that opinion, which take this day to include all the time from that wherein this was spoken to the first coming of Christ, and <note n="f" place="bottom">See Dutch Notes.</note> they also, who understand it, that this day began with the first day of Christs Incarnation, and is to last untill he shall again appear in the Clouds, to the last Judgement, which certainly allow too large a time to that day, which is so described by the Prophet, as to shew it to belong to a <note n="g" place="bottom">

               </p>
               <p>To proceed therefore to the explication of the words and expressions, which to the way that, according to what hath been said, we take, are plainly agreeable, and according to it and no other, run in an equal tenor, he saith, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven,</hi> &amp;c. We had before an expression to the same purpose, c. III. <hi>v.</hi> 2. especially according to their explication, who there read, <hi>it, i. e.</hi> the day of the Lords coming, the day here again spoken of shall be <hi>as a refiners fire,</hi> as we said <hi>Kimchi</hi> doth. The words as here set down, with <hi>behold</hi> for ushering in the strangeness of the thing, prefixed, sound out the greatest horror that can possibly be expressed, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond which nothing but the inexpressible terror of the conflagration of the whole World at the last day (of which therefore it is, as we have said, usually interpreted) can be imagined; and nearer to which no terrible judgement in the World ever on any People executed, came (or can well come) then this here spoken of. While he saith that the day shall <hi>burn as an oven,</hi> what doth it less then represent the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of those whom the judgement spoken of shall then seize, to be as if they were surroun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with fire, without possibility of avoiding the fury and dire effects thereof, then which nothing, we know, is to men more terrible; as if the heavens were on fire over their heads, and made an hideous noise, and the Elements mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with fervent heat about them, and the Earth and all the works therein were burning; that we may take in, and so compare with these, those not unlike expressions in II <hi>Pet.</hi> III.10, 12. by which usually the terror of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:33128:45"/>
the day of the last general Judgement, is thought to be described: but in the opinion of the learned Doctor <hi>Hammond,</hi> this that is here spoken of, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the judgement threatn'd to the obstinate Jewish Nation.</p>
               <p>The words (as there, so here also) are such as no figurative or hyperbolical expressions that can be possibly used for setting forth a most dreadful judgement can surpass, yet so great was the judgement according to this predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction executed on them, as that we may look on them not as a figurative but real description of what should be. What could be said less to express the face of things, when their stately City, and magnificent Temple were all at once on fire, and none could quench it? may it not well be said, that the day there then burnt like an oven, and in words appositely here appliable, though spoken to another sense, <hi>Isa.</hi> XXXI.9. <hi>that Gods fire was then in Zion, and his furnace in Jerusalem?</hi> To shew how in that day (that <note n="i" place="bottom">

                  <hi>day of punishment,</hi> as an ancient Arabick Translator, not unfitly for expressing the sense, renders it) that which he before said concerning a certain discrimination to be made between the righteous and the wicked, should be made evident, he describes in the following words the effects of it, and first as concerning the wicked saying, <hi>and all the proud, yea and all that do wickedly,</hi> all those that obstinately went on in wicked courses, and contemned God and his Laws, <hi>shall be stubble, and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of Hosts, &amp;c.</hi> Where is now then any occasion to say, as they did, <hi>c.</hi> III.15. <hi>we call the proud happy, yea they that work wickedness are set up, yea they that tempt God are delivered,</hi> what shall now become of their happiness, and of their glory, when they shall be, but as stubble be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fire, which shall without delay or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance be certainly consumed? where is now that deliverance that they talked of? how shall they deliver themselves? who shall deliver them? no escape shall there be found for them, such utter destruction shall that day that cometh in that dreadful manner bring on them, as if they were clear burnt up, so that <hi>it shall leave them neither root, nor branch,</hi> which is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently contrary to that being set up, or built, <hi>c.</hi> III.15.</p>
               <p>This also is a <note n="k" place="bottom">Drus. Compare Job, c. XVIII.16, 19.</note> proverbial speech to express utter destruction by a similitude taken from a tree, destroyed not only by having its boughs and branches cut off, but its roots also plucked up. The Chalde Paraphrast renders it, <hi>shall not leave them son nor nephew</hi>: because, saith <hi>Kimchi</hi> explaining it, the first son is as the root, and his son is as the branch (but we may rather say, it shall leave neither them nor their posterity: the Father being the root, the sons and posterity branches from him. That interpretation of the Chalde being by most of the Jewish Expositors followed, <hi>Abarbinel</hi> not seeing how that may be so conveniently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the punishment of the wicked at the Resurrection, finds out another explication which he thinks more convenient, <hi>viz.</hi> That what is said, is concerning the good works of wicked men, for which because in this World they receive their reward, God will not there leave to them any root, or branch of any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment by them performed, or any good work, for which they may receive reward in the day of Judgement, according to a saying of their Rabbins,
<q>That he the most of whose works are evil, and the least part good, he is rewarded for his small righteousness in this World, that he may be wholy punished in the World to come.</q>
This he gives as his own opinion, though a very far fetched one, not knowing how to adapt otherwise the words of the Text to that punishment of the day of Judgement, which he here thinks to be the day spoken of. Other opinions he mentions also, as of some, that by <hi>branch</hi> is understood the infants of wicked men, as if they should not be admitted into the World to come; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise that by <hi>root</hi> is understood the soul, and by <hi>branch</hi> the body, with the like, <note n="l" place="bottom">Talmud. Aboda Zara, c. 1. fol. 4. col. 1.</note> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther root in this World, nor branch in the World to come.</p>
               <p>Among Christian Expositors also they who expound the Text concerning the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are at some <note n="m" place="bottom">See Ch. à Castro.</note> difference in applying the expression to the matter or thing signified, but to them who go the way that we have chosen, of expounding the Text concerning the day of the destruction of the Jews and their City by the Romans, there is no difficulty; but the proverbial speech may be interpreted as nigh to the letter as may be, to denote, Fathers and Children, the wicked and their posterity. Well may that day be said to have burnt them up, and consumed them, so as to leave them neither root nor branch; when at that time Histories testify, that in the Siege and taking of the City, there perished of them by fire, famine, and sword, no less then eleven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand; to which if we add those vast multitudes, and many thousands of others which were immediatly and within the space of few years after by the same enemies destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (which all we may account as consumed by the time, which is called that day, having the authority of a Jew,<hi>Kimchi</hi> himself, so far to extend the notion of that day, and reckon all for one continued day of destruction, while he saith, although it be said, that the day shall
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:33128:45"/>
burn them up, yet their destruction shall not be all in one day, but they shall go on in pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing, and in a short time be consumed): add, I say, those great multitudes to the former, (if there be need,) and what less can be said to express the greatness of the desolation and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, then that they were cut off root and branch, so far that it is no small wonder that there should be any remainder of them.</p>
               <p>These things are manifest out of the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of those times, especially out of <hi>Josephus</hi>'s History of the Jewish War, in the sixth Book, according to the Greek division, the seventh according to the Latin; and <hi>Eusebius lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 5. as to the main and first part concerning the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the City, and those multitudes that were then there gathered together, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished; and as to the gleanings of that day, as we may call the following destructions of the Jews, out of such other Historians as relate the great variety of miseries and calamities which one on the back of another befell them, by their pride, as it is here called, and obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate behaviour towards the Lord pulled on them. If any have not opportunity of consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting those Histories, he may without farther trouble find enough collected out of them by D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <note n="n" place="bottom">See him in his Notes on Matthew XXIV. and on Mar. XIII. note <hi rend="sup">a</hi>, and on the second of Pet. 3. note <hi rend="sup">g</hi>, and on Revel. c. VI. note <hi rend="sup">d</hi>, and note <hi rend="sup">i</hi>, with other places.</note> 
                  <hi>Hammond,</hi> in his Annotations on the New Testament, (in which he applies several things, which by reason of the dreadfull expressions in which they are set down or denounced, are usually by Interpreters applied to the last ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Judgement, and destruction of the whole World, particularly to this day of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> which we look on as here meant, to shew, that if what is here said, in the highest language that a scene of horror may be represented by, be applied to what was then really done, there will be found no great hyperbole, or figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive exceeding in it, but rather a plain draught, or description before hand, according to which things were afterward acted.</p>
               <p>By what hath been said, appears what little reason there was to account <hi>the proud happy, and those that work wickedness set up, and that God delighted in them,</hi> because at that time they were suffered to prosper, but whether there were any profit in serving God, and keeping his Ordinances, and what should be done for them by which any might discern betwixt the righteous and the wicked; that part of the question remains yet unanswered, for if they perish with the wicked, be involved in one common judgement with them; what is their case yet better then theirs? To this therefore a full answer follows in the next words.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>2</hi> ¶ But unto you that fear my Name, shall the sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings, and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>But unto you that fear my Name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings,</hi> &amp;c.] In these words is safety and happiness assured to the righteous, in the day that the wicked shall be miserably destroyed, so that there shall be a manifest discrimination between them. What S. <hi>Peter</hi> saith, <hi>The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptation, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of Judgement to be punished,</hi> II <hi>Pet.</hi> II.9. which he infers from two examples before given, <hi>viz.</hi> his saving <hi>Noah,</hi> when he brought in the Floud upon the World of the ungodly; And his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering just <hi>Lot,</hi> when he turned the Cities of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha</hi> into ashes, and brought them to utter destruction by fire from Heaven, <hi>ver.</hi> 5, 6, 7. is here manifestly asserted, in that the same day which shall come as a burning oven to the proud wicked ones, to burn them up and destroy them, shall be to those that fear the Name of the Lord, as a glorious day wherein the benigne Sun shall arise with his best influences of comfort to them, to cherish and refresh their drooping spirits.</p>
               <p>It is well known that the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Tse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dakah</hi> here rendred <hi>righteousness,</hi> is used to si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnify both <hi>justice</hi> or <hi>righteousness,</hi> and also <hi>benignity</hi> or <hi>mercy</hi>; and both significations will to this place well agree: for that Salvation and comfort, then to be reached forth to the righteous, is a demonstration both of justice and mercy; by it shall be declared the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eousness of God, whose justice those wicked ones questioned, saying, <hi>where is the God of Judgement, c.</hi> II.17. in that he now rewardeth them for their obedience, when he punisheth those that would not obey, and by it also his mercy in sparing them, though perhaps having many defects in them, in that day of Judgment, <hi>as a man spareth his own son that serveth him,</hi> as he promiseth, <hi>c.</hi> III.17. And this would be a clear sense if we should no farther press the letter of the words then so by way of similitude, to denote that the same time which should be to the wicked, a day of utter destruction, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming them as fire, should be by the justice and mercy of God to the godly, as a fair day wherein the Sun doth kindly arise, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignly and largely impart his light (as <hi>Drusius</hi> explains the expression) for the comfort of men and other creatures; a gracious and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable

day, a day of saving health to them: so <hi>Kimchi,</hi> not unaptly, notes that the words import, that they should be delivered from all evil, and rejoyce with a good (or glad) heart. But Interpreters think it not enough to stop here, but farther enquire who is meant by this Sun, and Christians generally agree that Christ who is, <note n="o" place="bottom">See D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Hammond on Luk. I.78.</note> 
                  <hi>Luke</hi> I.78. called the <hi>day-spring</hi> or rising Sun, is by this title meant; and this day, here spoken of, being the day of his coming (as it is, <hi>c.</hi> III.2. called) he being entitled a Sun, his coming in it may be well called his rising. Why Christ may be so called, many reasons may be, and are, brought by Interpreters. But among them to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose in this place, and according to our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of the time here spoken of, the most agreeable will be; because as by the Suns rising those things, which before were covered in darkness, are discovered and made appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, so by his coming in this manner both <note n="p" place="bottom">See Calvin.</note> Gods justice, and his mercy to them that fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Name, which before was not so discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nible while he suffered them to be mixed with the wicked, yea insulted over by them, as if he did not own them more then others, nor take any peculiar care of them, so that they sate as it were in the shadow of death, should now be made conspicuous to all, in his freeing them from their oppressions, delivering them from those judgements by which the wicked were destroyed, and signally rewarding them for their obedience, so that they that sate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in darkness now should see a great light, and joyfully walk in it. Such a difference should be in their condition from what it was before, as that it might well be said, The Sun of right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eousness, of justice and mercy, was risen to them, and that with healing in his wings, <hi>i. e.</hi> his comfortable raies or beams, as all agree by wings here to be meant. The ordinary Sun kindly arising in the morning, may at any time be said, to bring healing in his wings, to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse and communicate health by his raies, both to men and other creatures, which after his setting, and in his absence, all the night seem to droop, languish, to be sick and out of order, and those that are so otherwise, in that while to be more so. Whence the Jews have a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbial speech, which may serve something to illustrate this expression. <note n="q" place="bottom">Baba bathura cap. 1. fol. 16. col. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>The Sun ariseth, the infirmity decreaseth,</hi> that is, As the Sun riseth, so infirmities decrease. Much more of this Sun might it be said, that he did at his arising to those that feared the Lord, bring healing with him in his wings to them in that day of distress, worse then the darkest night, the shadow of death it self, which without his arising to them would necessarily have swallowed up them too in destruction, and could not but by the apprehension of it, make them as even sick at heart according to what he said, <hi>c.</hi> III.2. <hi>who may abide the day of his coming?</hi> So terrible should it be that all mens hearts should <note n="r" place="bottom">Luk. XXI.26.</note> fail for fear, in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of those things that should come on them, yet even then, in regard of his soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary effects that his coming should have to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them that feared his Name, he bid them <note n="s" place="bottom">ib. 28.</note>, when these things, these terrible things should begin to come to pass, to look up and lift up their heads, for that their redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption then drew nigh, their deliverance from the persecutions by the unbeleiving Jews, which they had endured, and from the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers which threatned them, as, except by his extraordinary Providence inevitable, and his making that which was for the destruction of his enemies, occasion of comfort and prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to them, may well be termed healing. But we may not confine it only to the rescue of their persons, and preservation of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, nor the outward joy that they should find from that, but look on the inward spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual comfort, and the healing of their <note n="t" place="bottom">See Psal. CXlVII.3.</note> broken hearts, and fainting spirits, in preserving them from failing by fear and despair, as a greater part of it, and therefore not unfitly doth <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> interpret this arising of the Sun of right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eousness with healing in his wings, of the Collation of the holy Spirit, which Christ should send to his to shine in their hearts, and bring perfect health to their minds; that spirit of comfort, the only true comforter. In regard of both these, <hi>viz.</hi> both his rescuing and delivering those that feared his Name, and protecting and delivering them from their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward fears and dangers, and persecutions, and his inward illumination and comforting of them by his good Spirit, shewing himself in all waies a Sun and shield to them; was this Prophecy that he should arise to them with healing in his wings, evidently and abundantly made good to them in that day. And certainly in all respects doth that title of the Sun of righteousness agree to Christ the fountain of true heavenly light, who <hi>enlightneth every man coming into the World,</hi> 
                  <note n="u" place="bottom">See D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Hammond on that place, and see Joh. VIII.12. and XII.46.</note>

               <p>In respect to that, the explication of a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note n="f" place="bottom">Grot.</note> man comes closer, which is, God shall as with his hand bring you out of the City ready to be destroyed; according to that way of taking care for the preservation of his faithfull servants, when destruction is sent on the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked among whom they are, of which we have many examples. Our Saviour gives us two, <hi>Luk.</hi> XVII.27. the one of <hi>Noah,</hi> at the general De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge, whom he taught first to make an Ark for his preservation, and brought not the Flood on the ungodly till he was first by that secured, but <hi>as soon as Noah entred into the Ark, the Flood came and destroyed them all.</hi> The other of <hi>Lot v.</hi> 29. to whom God purposing to destroy <hi>Sodom,</hi> sent Angels to lead him by the hand out of the City, by them telling him that he could not do any thing till he was escaped, <hi>Gen.</hi> XIX.22. <hi>But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from Heaven, and destroyed them all.</hi> And a Vision there is presented to the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> c.

Tanchum,</hi> who intimates that the word having different significations, that is to be taken which the sense of the place requires, or best agrees to.

And however the words be here rendred, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to any of those Interpretations that we have mentioned, the scope will still be the same whether we follow those that render <hi>ye shall leap,</hi> or those that render <hi>ye shall grow up, be lusty</hi> or <hi>fat and strong, like fatted Calves.</hi> The scope will, I say, be still the same, <hi>viz.</hi> to be a promise of great happiness and prosperity, and security and occasion of joy and exulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to those spoken to, that they shall not only find healing by the arising of the Sun of righteousness, but also find occasion of delight and joy, as <note n="d" place="bottom">Tract. of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, c. 1. fol. 4. col. 1.</note> a Talmudical Doctor expresses it. And this prosperity and exultation so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively described do they that by <hi>the day</hi> here spoken of, understand <hi>the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and to concern all, apply to the joy and happy condition which then the Saints shall be made partakers of: but certainly that is <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor.

               <p>This comparison may seem more to agree to something that shall in this life be enjoyed, and so therefore do we apply it to denote the secure and happy condition, which in that dreadful day of <hi>Jerusalem</hi>'s destruction (which by this day here we understand) God would of his mercy place those that feared his Name, and sincerely embraced Christs Doctrine, in. There is no doubt a promise to them of safety and deliverance in that dreadful day: and that were great kindness from God to them, and an evident sign of his love to them and providencial care over them, if it were only so, and they needed not any thing more for proof of it then their deliverance from so great and unavoidable destruction, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what he saith to <hi>Baruch, Jerem.</hi> XLV.4, 5. <hi>That which I have built will I break down, and that which I have planted will I pluck up, even this whole Land. And seekest thou great things for thy self? seek them not, for behold I will bring evil upon all flesh, saith the Lord: but thy life will I give unto thee for a prey in all places whither thou goest,</hi> (as likewise to <hi>Ebed-melech</hi> he saith, <hi>c.</hi> XXXIX.16, 17, 18.) And had his promise now to those that feared his Name, been only so far, as that he would secure them and save their lives, when so many perished, this had been, we say, evidence enough of his peculiar love and fatherly compassion to them, by which they might sufficiently discern between the righteous and the wicked, between whom there appeared hitherto no difference, in the common opinion: but here is withall an evident promise of greater things, of joy and prosperity, and well being as well as being, set out in this comparative expression. But though righteousness hath the promise of the good things which respect this life, as well as those which respect that which is to come, of outward as well as inward good things, yet considering the nature of Christs Kingdom and his promises, we cannot but think respect to be had here also to that joy and comfort of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and <note n="e" place="bottom">Grot.</note> peace of conscience, which in the inward man they should find through the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and assistance of the holy spirit, <hi>the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter,</hi> by which they should have occasion, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Saviors <note n="f" place="bottom">Luk. VI.23.</note> Precept, to rejoyce and leap for joy, whatever outward trouble they should find; this inward joy should be so great as to express it self in vigor and alacrity, of the outward man also, as it seems here by this comparative expression intimated, and what they now felt, could not but be to them a pledge and certain token of finding the like deliverance in that last general Judgement also, when they shall not be <hi>as Calves of the stall,</hi> but <hi>as Angels,</hi> their bodies being made like Christs glorious body, and they by seeing God as he is, be made like unto him, and instated in all fulness of joy for ever, without any mixture of sorrow: though we do not with many look on that as the thing primarily here meant (though put in mind of, and given to look up to it,) but that liberty or happy condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which in and by that fearfull doom of the Jews w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> hitherto persecuted them, they should be brought to. And this is not only described by telling them in what happy plight and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition they shall be in themselves, but ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by declaring how it shall be with them in respect to the wicked who before Lorded it over them, so as that now there shall be an evident discrimination between them compared one with the other. That follows in the next verse.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>3</hi> And ye shall tread down the wicked: for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet, in the day that I shall do this, saith the Lord of hosts.</q>
               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:33128:48"/>
                  <hi>And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be as ashes under the soles of your feet,</hi> &amp;c.] In the foregoing Chapter, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. the wicked are looked on by men judging according to the present face of things, as happy men, men set up, and <note n="g" place="bottom">Jer. VII.10.</note> delivered to do all those abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations whereby they tempted God, so that they thought it in vain to serve God, no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to keep his Ordinances, or to walk mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully before him: but see, in that day appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God for a discrimination between them, what a strange alteration shall be. They which before were kept under shall now tread down those that were so high, and the proud ones being by that burning day brought to destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction be as ashes (or dust) under the soles of their feet whom they thought to trample on. By this expression is manifestly set forth the difference which should then be made by God betwixt the wicked and the godly, so as that the one should appear to be owned by him, and by that means not only in a safe but in an happy and honorable condition, the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by him, and given up to destruction, and so in the vilest and lowest condition that any can be brought to, which is expressed by comparing them to dust and ashes under the feet of others.</p>
               <p>And it were sufficient thus much to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand by the phrase, as a figurative expression concerning the difference of their conditions, by which should be made good what is said, <hi>c.</hi> III. <hi>v.</hi> 18. <hi>Then shall ye return and discern between the righteous and the wicked,</hi> &amp;c. This is all that they who look on these words as descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the day of the last Judgement, and what shall then be done, <note n="h" place="bottom">Dan. XII.2.</note> 
                  <hi>when the just shall awake to everlasting life, and the wicked to shame and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting contempt,</hi> can require for the making good of the expression, and as much also as under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing it of the day of his proceeding in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against the Jews at the destruction of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> we need require, or <note n="i" place="bottom">Dutch Notes on ver. 1.</note> they also who take this day to include all the time between Christs coming in the flesh, till his last coming at the day of Judgement. Yet the learned <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> thinks that the words literally, and as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any thing of figure in them understood, may be looked on as made good at that time, inasmuch as after the destruction of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> wherein so many were consumed by fire, such of the Christians as did after come thither, did really tread on their ashes.

A pretty invention for such as will believe it on their authority. But I do not see that the soberer among them do; otherwise they would probably have made more use of it in their Expositions of this place. <hi>Abarbinel</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed makes mention of it, but tells us that the simple meaning in these words is to shew;
<q>That if we see the way of the wicked to prosper, and the righteous to go mournfully<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> behold that is it which happeneth in this dark World, but when the Lord of Hosts shall arise a Sun and shield in his divine day, and shall judge all living, he shall give to every one according to his waies, and according to the fruit of his doings.</q>
Neither <hi>R. Salomo</hi>; nor <hi>Aben Ezra,</hi> nor <hi>David Kimchi</hi> mention it at all; the last of these thus expounding the words,
<q>He saith, that now the wicked bear rule over you, but in that time ye shall trample them under the soles of your feet. What he saith <hi>ashes,</hi> is a proverbial or compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative expression, because he had before said that the day that should come, should burn them up.</q>
It appears then that he did not think that ashes here ought literally to be meant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but to denote the vileness and contemptible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their condition. Neither find we any mention of it in <hi>R. Tanchum,</hi> who though he differ from what we follow, in that he looks on the things spoken as not yet fulfilled, but to come, yet affords us words which we may well make use of in our way, which though he put at the end of the Chapter, yet may here conveniently be put, as having respect to what hath been said already, more then to what follows; and they thus sound, [Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der (saith he) the great wisdome in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of the Prophetical revelation, however it be to be understood, that whereas there is for the righteous a reward in this World, and in the World to come, and for the wicked on the contrary punishment in this World, and in the World to come, these passages of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture are fitted to both intentions at once, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to an outward (or literal) sense and an inward meaning. As to the outward meaning it expresseth what shall be in the daies of Messiah, to wit, that punishment shall then encompass the wicked, and they shall be consumed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and be burnt up, as he saith, <hi>Behold the day cometh burning as an oven</hi>; but as for the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous of <hi>Israel,</hi> the light of divine Providence shall arise upon them, and they shall be healed by the manifestation of truths, from that grief which they sustained by reason of their being hidden from them; and that is it which he saith, <hi>And there shall arise to you that fear my Name, the Sun of righteousness, and healing in his wings,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:33128:49"/>
&amp;c.</hi> But as to the inward meaning, it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, as to those that feared the Lord, and thought on his Name, <hi>viz.</hi> which sincerely did so after their knowledge of him and walking in his waies, that there should be to them an everlasting duration in his presence, which is that writing down of their righteousness in a book of remembrance before him, and they should be a peculiar to him among mankind, which is what he saith, <hi>And they shall be to me, saith the Lord of Hosts, in the day which I shall make</hi> (or, when I shall do this) <hi>a peculiar, &amp;c.</hi> But as for the wicked, to them shall the day come burning as an oven, which is the punishment of the World to come, accordingly as our wise men have declared, as likewise what is said, <hi>and the day that cometh shall burn them up.</hi> And by <note n="l" place="bottom">Aben Ezra and others note by Sun ver 2. to be signified, day, the rising of the Sun causing the day.</note> 
                  <hi>day</hi> he expresseth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> both happiness and misery, for two different meanings (or reasons) 1. <hi>happiness,</hi> in regard of the light which is found in the day after the darkness of the night, like that clearness of apprehension that shall accrue to the perfected soul after its separation from grose matter, <hi>i. e.</hi> the matter of the body; then <hi>misery,</hi> by reason of extreme heat, that is found in the day proportionable to the grievousness of that condition, and the extremity of the pain thereof, as he likewise compares it to <hi>fire,</hi> saying, <hi>burning like an oven.</hi> And because the wicked shall be burnt with that fire, whereas the degree of the righteous shall be exalted, he compareth them also to <hi>ashes</hi> under their feet, saying, <hi>and ye shall tread down the wicked, for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet.</hi> and he explains his comparing <hi>happiness</hi> to <hi>light,</hi> in what he saith, <hi>And there shall arise to you that fear my Name the Sun of righteousness, &amp;c.</hi> And that is an intellectual light which shall accrue by the right disposition of the Soul, and the rectification of the deeds, by the clearness of the shining of which the Soul shall find rest, and be healed from the pains of the distraction of the senses, and their disturbance (or stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling, or contrary motions;) that is it which he saith, <hi>with healing in his wings.</hi> And to like purpose, saith <hi>Isaiah,</hi> c. LVIII.8. <hi>Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thy health shall spring forth speedily; and thy righteousness shall go before thee, the glory of the Lord shall be thy rereward.</hi> We beg of the Lord therefore that he will assist us for attaining to those inward (or hidden) promises, by hastning the outward (or visible) ones, that our knowledge and worship of him may be sincere, and that may occasion to us an encrease of appropinquation to his Majesty, or, bring us nearer to him, and that may be made good to us, which he saith, <hi>Isaiah</hi> XXXV.3, 4. <hi>strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees, say to them that are of a fearfull heart, Be strong, fear not: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold your God will come with vengeance, &amp;c.</hi>]</p>
               <p>These are his words (which if opportunity serve we shall at the end of these Notes set down in his own language.) I thought conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to give them at length, (though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not all to our present purpose) because though he be out in the main matter of timing things, yet what he saith applied to the right time, will illustrate and confirm what we look on as the truest way of expounding them, <hi>viz.</hi> that literally and primarily they describe to us a day wherein God would proceed in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against the Nation of the Jews, for making a discrimination betwixt the righteous and the wicked, which because it was at that present, when this, Prophet lived and spake to them, not so discernible, they took thence occasion to question his Justice, and spake <hi>stout words a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him,</hi> saying, <hi>It is vain to serve God,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>where is the God of Judgement</hi>? That day it appears <hi>c.</hi> III.1, 2. should be at, or, by the coming of Christ, and by his coming is meant (as we have shewed) his coming in Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to them at the destruction of <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> In that our forecited Author is out, that he thinks Christ not yet come, and so that day not yet come: whereas we (as the truth is) look on both as already come; and that being granted, then we say that in that he is right, that here is described a day of discrimination to be made in this World, as there was then made by the terrible destruction of the wicked among the unbelieving Jews, and gracious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scue and deliverance of those that believed in Christ; but withal, that by the wonderfull wisdom of God, that coming of Christ, to judge them then, is so described, as to set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eies another coming of his to judge all the World at the last day, wherein shall be made a perfect separation between the righteous and the unrighteous, those being received into joy and glory, and perfect hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness in the presence of God and the Sun of righteousness, <note n="m" place="bottom">Rev.

And such may well be called the daies of Christs Incarnation, his preaching the Gospell, his Resurrection, his coming to Judgement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Jews of that generation, which all may be (according to what we have before said) looked as on one day, the day here spoken of, especially the last act mentioned, and here peculiarly pointed out, wherein was brought a terrible destruction on his enemies, and wonderfull deliverance to his friends; and for the same reason may the day of the last Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be so likewise called, which (as we said) may well be looked on as here pointed out, though not primarily meant as some seem to take it with omission of the other. In this day that they might know what he had said should certainly come to pass, he adds his solemn confirmation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saith the Lord of Hosts,</hi>] He who hath all power in his hand, at whose beck are all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in Heaven and Earth, as ready Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters to execute his pleasure, and therefore can make good whatsoever he saith, and who is true in his sayings, and will not alter the thing that is gone out of his mouth, he hath said it? the mighty, the faithfull God hath spoken, and who shall disannul it? he hath said it, and it is therefore as certain as if it were already done. According therefore to what he said, did that day come on the Jews, the People here spoken to, in the time appointed, and all those things here foretold, come to pass. And as certainly shall that other day, here (as we said) typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied or intimated, come on all the World in the time appointed for it, because the Lord of Hosts hath though not expresly here said it, yet not obscurely intimated, and elsewhere more plainly said it; so that all must expect that as certainly to come on them all, as they have seen the former already to have come on the Jews. They deny it indeed to have been yet come on them, and would have it to si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnify some thing to come not on themselves, but on their enemies, but it is because they wilfully shut their eies against that which all the World besides hath seen, and with amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment acknowledge it. A strange thing that that terrible destruction of their Country and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, such as was never yet parallel'd by any thing that happened to any Nation besides, nor can be out-done by any thing imaginable, but the day of general Judgement and confla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration of all the World, which it not obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely represented, should work no more on them. Our prayer for them therefore must not be in their own words, that God would hasten the coming of that first day, that so they might with better preparations expect the second, but that he would open their eies to see, and incline their wills to acknowledge, that to have come upon them, which God here threatned, and so be turned and brought near to Christ; for rejecting whom was all that came on their Ancestors, and themselves ever since, that so, what shall come to pass of that last coming of his, may not be so terrible to them, but he then may appear to them <hi>as the Sun of right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eousness with healing in his wings</hi> to their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who before came in flaming fire, as a burning oven to destroy them, who would not receive and obey <note n="p" place="bottom">II Thessal. I.8.</note> his Gospel. So shall they prevent by their repentance the evil of that day, though their Ancestors would not, though by God warned, seek to prevent the evil of the other: would not, I say; for though God here shews the certainty of the coming of that day, by saying, <hi>saith the Lord of Hosts,</hi> and he knew what they would do, yet that it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied a condition of their persisting to do as they did, and that by their repentance and change of their waies it might have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, appears by what he adds (not certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to no purpose) to move them to it, by bidding them to <hi>remember the Law of Moses,</hi> &amp;c. and promising to send <hi>Eliah</hi> to seek to convert them, <hi>lest he should come,</hi> &amp;c. to whom if they would not hearken they should inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably pull on themselves destruction.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Remember ye the Law of Moses my servant,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>Aben Ezra</hi>'s Gloss on these words is not amiss, <hi>Remember the Law of Moses,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>i. e.</hi> (saith he) keep (or observe) it; for it will teach you the way of the fear of the Lord, and so when the mentioned day shall come, <hi>ye shall be delivered.</hi> But the other Jews go wider, as by considering their words, we shall perceive. <hi>Abarbinel</hi> thus gives the coherence of these words with the former,
<q>Forasmuch as the worship (or service of God) which should bring them to that last true reward at the Resurrection, was the worship accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Law and Commandments, and that great rebellion which should bring to that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, which he mentions, is the omis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion (or rejection) of the Law, therefore he subjoyns to this which he hath said, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:33128:50"/>
the Law of Moses my servant,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to them that by means of that they should attain to the reward, and true prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</q>
That in which he errs in this Exposition is, in that he refers what is here spoken to the day of the Resurrection, which belongs to that day of <hi>Jerusalems</hi> Visitation, the evil of which that they might prevent, or in it find deliverance, he commends to them the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance and observance, in the mean while, of the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> as a faithful rule, seeing they should after this have no more Prophets to direct them, till his sending to them <hi>Elias</hi> at the approach of that day. Much in like kind errs <hi>R. Tanchum, viz.</hi> in mis-timing the things spoken of, saying,
<q>That this was given as a Precept to those of the Captivity, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding it to <hi>Israel</hi> by the hand of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, because after him Prophecy should cease from among them, by reason of the obscurity of the Captivity; and the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (saith he) is that he that would attain to the happiness spoken of, and deliverance from punishment, ought necessarily to obey the commands of the Law, continued (or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered down) among them.</q>
In which Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position he passeth over the time to which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belonged what is spoken, <hi>viz.</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this Prophecy, and the coming of the <hi>Eliah</hi> here meant, wherein Prophecy (as he observes) should (and did) cease among them, and so the coming of that day of Judgement and discrimination; to fasten it on times, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> did not begin till after the completion of this Prophecy, according to its proper and primary meaning, <hi>viz.</hi> since the destruction of <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem. David Kimchi</hi> is not content to run on in the like error, but strives to justify it by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusing Christians of error in misinterpreting the words; his Exposition runs thus, He saith, untill the day of Judgement come, remember ye in every generation the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> my Servant to do all, or according to all, that is written in it. <hi>Which I commanded unto him in Horeb,</hi> i. e. <hi>as I commanded him in Horeb,</hi> not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <note n="q" place="bottom">S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

His meaning seems this, That here is a command that till the last day of Judgement they should precisely keep the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> according to all that was written in it, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the letter of what was written, just as it was given to him and from him to them, and that therefore the words refute the Christians who say, that the Law was to endure but for a time, according to the literal meaning of it, but that the literall meaning was to yeild to a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual meaning according to which Christ inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted it. But we say that this man frames an argument on false grounds, and that the text makes not against us, as he would have it, and hath in it an answer to, and refutation of them, not of us, who embrace them, both according to the letter, from which he departs, and the true meaning of them, which he perverts. First, in that he saith that here is a command that they should remember the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> in every generation untill the day of the last Judgement. If he mean (as manifestly he doth) the day of the last Judgement, it is manifest that what is spoken hath not primarily respect to that, but to that day of Gods National Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be executed on the Jews, continuing in obstinate rebellion against him? that was the day of the Lord in this Chapter of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, and the foregoing, properly spoken of, as we have shewed, though so described as to represent to us, and necessarily to put us in mind of the last general Judgement too. Besides, the words are indefinitly spoken without referring to any set time: if we will enquire till what time they may seem to bind; that will most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently be answered to, from the next fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words, <hi>viz.</hi> till he send <hi>Eliah</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet before the coming of the day of the Lord; warning, that till his coming they should look to the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> as their Director. So that hence is no evident ground from which to conclude the perpetuity of the Law, against such as should deny it. That it should last in force till that day, is as much as can from these words be concluded, and that which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour saith, <hi>The Law and the Prophets were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till John, since that time the Kingdome of God is preached, Luke</hi> XVI.16. Farther, in that he saith, according to all that is written in it, and as I commanded him in <hi>Horeb</hi>; meaning that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing in the Law was just as it is written in it, and every thing punctually in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and according to the letter as it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, is his gloss; whereas in the Text it is only <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>which I commanded,</hi> and not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>as</hi>; which though in it self it may seem to make no great difference, yet according to his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it manifestly doth, according to what he adds, not according to what the Christians say, that it (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Law) was given for a time only to be observed, according to the letter (as it sounds) but that <hi>Jesus</hi> came and interpreted it spiritually, and so hereafter it were to be observed or understood according to that spiritual, and not its literal meaning. For answer to all this we might bid him only to clear himself, by answering to what is said, <hi>Jer.</hi> XXXI.31, 32. <hi>Behold the daies come, saith the Lord, that I will make a new Covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah, not according to the Covenant which I made with
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:33128:50"/>
their Fathers,</hi> &amp;c. whence we may conclude with the Apostle, <hi>Heb.</hi> VIII.8. that in that he saith a new Covenant, it is manifest that the first was to be made old, that the new might take place. But to deal more distinctly with him; in that he finds fault with the words of the Christians, let him take from Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self what they say, <hi>think not that I am come to destroy the Law, and the Prophets, I am not come to destroy but to fulfill. For verily I say unto you, till Heaven and Earth pass, one jot, or one title shall in no wise pass from the Law till all be fulfilled. Mat.</hi> V.17, 18. What is here spoken any way derogatoty to the Law of <hi>Moses</hi>? is not here the perpetuity of the Law as plainly asserted, as the Rabbin himself could assert it, but then his gloss <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> all just as it is written, is not to be admitted as if every thing were still so to be observed as at first it was, and just as it was given to <hi>Moses</hi>; as if all things in it were of like moment and equally essential: for in it were diverse things which were to be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, and being fulfilled, could require no farther observance; such were those ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious parts of it, which were types and sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, and could not but by the coming of the substance, which was Christ, have an end put to them, and necessarily be done away, not by being mean while violated but comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The other more substantial parts, <hi>viz.</hi> the moral precepts are so far from being abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by him, as that being purged from all those corrupt glosses, and Traditions of the Jews, by which they were almost made void and of none effect, they have not only their true meaning and extent given them, but are backt and confirmed anew by his authority, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to the perpetual observance of all his followers. And for what he looks on as a fault to be objected; that we affirm that Christ inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted the Law spiritually, as if it were no more literally to be understood, I know not what he would make to be the force of his objection, but to conclude against themselves that they are carnal, and so would not have any thing of the Law so understood as to cross their carnal minds, or to require any more then the carnal performances of the outward man, which to think, appears to have been from of old their error, and such as they are willing still to continue in. For <hi>the Law is spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, Rom.</hi> VII.14. and alwaies so was; that which made it not to be so understood, and not to have answerable effects, was the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality of men, not the fault of the Law. If Christ vindicated it from the wrong by them done to it by their gross and false understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and require the obedience of the inward as well as outward man, shall that be accounted an injury to it, or a destroying of it? if he mean that we say that the former types and shadows directed to more then was by them outwardly performed, and that what was by them really meant, was by and in him completed, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in a more excellent manner, when he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to put away sin by the <note n="r" place="bottom">Heb. IX.26.</note> Sacrifice of Himself, and so to make all other Sacrifices use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, and by the sprinkling of his Blood to put an end to such other carnal ordinances as were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed on them till the <note n="s" place="bottom">Ejusd. V.10.</note> time of reformation only; if I say by what he calls interpreting the law spiritually, he means any of these things; he speaks of that which was a restoring the Law to its true meaning, and a perfecting, not a violating of it: so that in these words is no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer (as he tells us it is) against any thing that Christians say, but they shew of him, and those of his Religion, that they themselves do not duly remember the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> which God commanded by him, nor consider or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand aright what that commanded them. If they would duly look into it, and apply the Prophecies thereof to what they concerned and the types thereof to what was signified by them, they could not but perceive that by them they were directed to Christ, and belief in him against whom they now urge them. This were sufficient for answer to him; even the bare setting down the words of Christ, and his Apostles, which shew that they taught nothing derogatory to the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> or by which they might be thought to violate any command, given either here or elsewhere for due observance of it; if there were here any occasion given to him of cavilling in that kind against them: but we look on this, which by occasion of his objection we have hitherto said as a mere digression, there being (however he hath sought occasion) no occasion, as we have already intimated by the words rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, given to him, as will appear by the scope of them duly considered, which we may in brief thus summe up. The Lord having by this Prophet reprooved the Jews for many sins, both by the Priests and People committed wherein they shewed great contempt or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of the Law by <hi>Moses</hi> given unto them, for which he delayed yet to punish them, or did but lightly punish them, giving them time to repent, and for that they for the generality, or most of them took thence occasion rather to applaud themselves in their wicked courses, then to repent of them, and to speak stout words against him, as if he delighted in sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and their waies, and were not a God of Judgement, nor had respect to them that served him, and therefore it were in vain to serve him, and having told them that he would in due time make it manifest, that he took all the while due notice of what they wickedly
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:33128:51"/>
did and said, and would for that end send both his Messenger to prepare the way before him, and the Lord the Messenger of the Covenant, who should bring all their doings to an exact trial, and so he would come near to them in Judgement, and bring on them such a day of discrimination betwixt the righteous and the wicked, wherein the wicked among them should be utterly destroyed, and the godly (who hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to seemed to be neglected) find Salvation and deliverance; and to move them therefore to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, having described the terror of that day; doth here, as it were, warn them, that if this would not move them they should not, as they had hitherto had, have any more Prophets to call on them, but be left only to that Law, which they had hitherto so much neglected, for their Director; which was indeed a sufficient Director to them, and had they duly hearkned to it, as they ought, they had not hitherto had such need of other Prophets to call upon them, and mind them of their duty. But now seeing he hath resolved to send them no more in that kind, till he send his Messenger, whom he calls <hi>Eliah,</hi> to prepare the way before him at the approach of that great day of discrimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which he hath threatned, he urgeth on them a due remembrance of that Law, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious heed, and observance of all commanded in it, as the only way whereby to prepare them for the receiving of his <hi>Eliah,</hi> that they might be converted by him, and so prevent the evil of that day, wherein he would smite with a curse those that did not prepare then to meet him.</p>
               <p>This being plainly the intent of the words, to raise from them a question concerning the perpetuity of the Law, or hence to think to prove it in all parts unalterable, is quite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the purpose. As they were given they are manifestly a command to them of that time to an observation of all the parts thereof, and the meaning of them is evident; thus: Look not henceforth for an ordinary or continued suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of Prophets, as you hitherto have had; but that you may prepare your selves for meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord in that day by <hi>Malachi</hi> told you of, remember duly the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> with the Statutes and Judgments thereof; take that for your rule and direction, whereby to square your lives and actions. Necessary was it that they should remember and duly attend to that, all of them; for though it was delivered to them by the hand of <hi>Moses</hi> the Servant of God, and therefore called his Law, yet was it by God himself commanded unto him for all <hi>Israel,</hi> all of it with all the Statutes and Judgements therein contained, all the parts thereof. <hi>By the Law</hi> 
                  <note n="t" place="bottom">Drus. Vatab. 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi> &amp; 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. Riber. &amp;c.</note> some will have meant the moral pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the Law, by <hi>Statutes</hi> the ceremonial, by <hi>Judgements</hi> the Judicial. <hi>Abarbinel</hi> (as the Jews commonly) by <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Chukkim, Statutes,</hi> will have to be understood such things for which no other reason is to be given, but Gods command, by <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Mishpatim, Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> such the reason of which was manifest. But without farther enquiry into the notion of the words we take to be in the words as here put, all the parts of the Law whatsoever, and of what nature soever, even every jot and title thereof (as our Savior speaks) to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, inasmuch as every one of them was then (when this was spoken) in force, not any of them completed by having had its due end. And therefore by being bid to <hi>remember</hi> them, they are told what was a duty necessarily incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on them. For all of them were commanded to all <hi>Israel,</hi> and they ought to observe all, and not forget or neglect any of them, and as this was a duty necessary to them, so was it a thing that would be greatly beneficial to them. So that it was the great kindness of God to call upon them to remember that which he had made formerly their duty, and might in justice without farther delay, or warning have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in Judgement against them for their many neglects and breaches of it, which by this Prophet he hath convinced them guilty of. The benefits of remembring of it, would have been the rectifying of them in their waies, which they had greatly perverted, the restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them from, and warning them to repent of, those many sins, which he hath convinced them to be guilty of, whereby they had greatly provoked him as he hath shewed, and to set them in such waies, wherein walking both they and their services should be accepted by him: and farther, to instruct them, concerning the Lord, the Messiah, whose coming he hath here warned them of, and how to receive him, and his Messenger that he would send to prepare the way before him. And this especially <note n="u" place="bottom">Munster, and see Chr. à Castro.</note> some will have to be understood as that for which he would have them remember the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi> That indeed did both point him out before hand in many types and figures, and expresly command obedience to him, when he should come, as <hi>Deut.</hi> XVIII.15. as that place is cited by S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and shewed to be meant of him, <hi>Act.</hi> II.22. and our Savior himself tells us that <hi>Moses</hi> wrote so plainly of him, that if they had believed <hi>Moses,</hi> they would have believed him. And that the cause that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved not his words, was because they belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not the writings of <hi>Moses, Joh.</hi> V.46, 47. The Law, (with which it may not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss, with <note n="x" place="bottom">Calv.</note> some, to take in the Prophets as appendages for exposition thereof, as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour joyns them, <hi>They have Moses and the Prophets, let them hear them, Luk.</hi> XVI.29.)
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:33128:51"/>
in these and other regards was plainly a <hi>School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master</hi> (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls it) which attended to, would have brought them to Christ. And so the remembring of it would have been eminently beneficial to them. But we look not on this only (though of chief regard and including the rest) as that wherein it would have been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to them to have remembred the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> but with this on all the other men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. By so doing they should have been so prepared for the coming of the day of the Lord so often before, and immediatly again spoken of, that it should not have for destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction come upon them: and their not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring it would (as in the event manifestly it did) bring it with all its dreadfull effects on them. It was then Gods great kindness to call on them to remember it for their own good. Yet is not that the utmost of his loving kindness. That they may see his mercies never cease, where men do not obstinately reject them, and forsake them, though they may not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect any more Prophets of an ordinary rank to warn them when they forget the Law, by observing which they should prevent the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of his day; yet that they may not have any excuse, or pretence at all to say that it came on them unawares, he promiseth hard before the coming thereof, an extraordinary one, whom he calls <hi>Eliah,</hi> to endeavor even then to convert them if they would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted. So follows it in the next verse.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>5</hi> ¶ Behold I will send you Elijah the Prophet, before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Behold I will send you Eliah the Prophet,</hi> &amp;c.] As to the connexion of these words with the former in such manner as we have said, <hi>Kim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi</hi> thus notes.
<q>Although I warn you to have recourse to the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> in every ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, yet notwithstanding for your good I will send to you <hi>Eliah</hi> the Prophet.</q>
But concerning the person, who is here meant by <hi>Eliah,</hi> is no small controversy and difference betwixt Expositors. The Jews agree not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselves; the forementioned <hi>Kimchi</hi> with several others of them, think it meant of that <hi>Eliah</hi> himself in person who lived and prophecyed in the time of <hi>Ahab</hi> King of <hi>Israel,</hi> I <hi>Kings</hi> XVII. &amp;c. The meaning, saith he, is,
<q>That he will put again his soul which ascended into Heaven, into a body w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> shall be created like his first body, because his first body turned to earth at his Ascension, every Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to its like element; and after that he shall cause him to live in his body, he shall send him to <hi>Israel</hi> before the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which is the great and dreadfull day of the Lord, and he shall warn both Fathers and children together, to turn with all their heart unto the Lord, and they that turn shall be delivered from the day of Judgement, as he saith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> seems to be of the same opinion, but to think that <hi>Eliah</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued still in the same body, and to believe that he appeared sometimes in the daies of their holy wisemen, and praies God to hasten the time of his coming. So <note n="y" place="bottom">See Not. in Porta Mosis, c. 6. p. 218. &amp;c.</note> others of them. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barbinel</hi> here thinks the same as to his person, though not determining whether he shall come in a new raised body, or in his old body, which he never put off,
<q>God, saith he, shews them that the first which shall arise at the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection shall be <hi>Eliah</hi> the Prophet, whether he shall rise as others do, if his body were consumed, when he was taken up, as some of the modern Doctors affirm, or whether he miraculously remain in his body and soul in the earthly Paradise, as our wise men thought, and that God will send him, before the great and dreadfull day of the Lord come, which is the day of judgement for all liveing.</q>
All these thinke that here is a promise of sending <hi>Eliah</hi> (the old <hi>Elijah</hi>) in person. Others of them of no less authority, think it not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily to be so meant, but of sending some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great Prophet, who because he should be like to <hi>Eliah</hi> in dignity, and knowledge, is called by his name, as appears by what <hi>R. Tanchum</hi> notes on this place, whose words are in their own language, partly set down in the Miscellaneous Notes in the book called <hi>Porta Mosis, c.</hi> VI. p. 219. and translated into En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish, sound thus,
<q>This without doubt, is a promise, that there should appear a Prophet in <hi>Israel</hi> a little before the time of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the Messiah, and some of the learned men do think that he is <hi>Elijah</hi> the Tishbite himself, and that is the opinion that is found in most of the allegorical Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; others think it meant that he should be some great Prophet like unto him in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and occupying his place as for what concerns the knowledge of God, and the making manifest of his name, and therefore called by the name of <hi>Eliah.</hi> So expresly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares that eminent great Doctor <hi>Rabbi Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> the son of <hi>Maimon</hi> 
                     <note n="z" place="bottom">viz. Tract. Melakim cap. ult.</note> at the end of his great juridical work called <hi>Mishneh Torah</hi> (or the repetition of the Law) and perhaps according to this opinion may he be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood to be <hi>Messias</hi> the son of <hi>Joseph,</hi> as he saith also.</q>
These words seem to intimate that that should be said by <hi>Maimonides</hi> in that place. But I do not find any such thing in him there at all, either in any printed Copies or Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripts, which I have seen. He mentions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:33128:52"/>
in the preceeding Chapter there, two Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siahs, but the first he saith was <hi>David</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered <hi>Israel</hi> from their enemies, and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond should be of the posterity of <hi>David</hi> who should save <hi>Israel</hi> from the hands of the children of <hi>Esau</hi> (the Romans he means) according to that obstinate error of theirs, expecting that Christ should come to restore a temporal King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to them, and destroy their enemies: but of a Messiah the son of <hi>Joseph</hi> (by whom what they mean hath been elsewhere shewn, <hi>viz.</hi> such a one as should be of the posterity of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph,</hi> and coming before the Messiah, the Son of <hi>David,</hi> undergo all the suffering part of such things as are in Scripture spoken of Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah, and leave only the glorious, and trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant part alone for the Son of <hi>David,</hi>) I find not in him any mention.] <hi>R. Tanchum</hi> goes on and saith,
<q>That here is said the same that was above said, <hi>c.</hi> III.1. <hi>Behold I send my Messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me,</hi> and that what he there saith, <hi>And the Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to his Temple, even the Messenger of the Covenant, &amp;c.</hi> is meant no doubt of the King Messiah: may he quickly be revealed. But the truth of the matter as to these promises will be distinctly known by their manifestation (or fulfilling.) For there is none that hath any certain Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition concerning them, but every one speaks according to what appears to him, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderates with him among the Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Texts of Scripture, as <note n="*" place="bottom">Melacim c. 2. § 2.</note> there also the same <hi>Moses</hi> the Son of <hi>Maimon</hi> declares.</q>
Out of these words of his appears that among them is this difference, that some understand <hi>Eliah</hi> in person to be here spoken of, others not so, but some great Prophet in degree and dignity like him. The same difference and doubt seems anciently to have been among their Ancestors, as appears by their question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>John Baptist,</hi> whether he were the <hi>Messiah,</hi> or <hi>Elias,</hi> or <hi>that Prophet, Joh.</hi> I.19, 20, 21. for what can those words more probably seem to mean, then whether he were <hi>Eliah</hi> in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, or that Prophet which was prophesied of, called by the name of <hi>Eliah.</hi> And we may think that the Scribes mostly thought that it should be <hi>Eliah</hi> in person, <hi>Matt.</hi> XVII.10. This difference and doubt he thinks cannot be determined but by the event and fulfilling of the things themselves: no man (saith <note n="a" place="bottom">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monides</hi>) can know how they should be, till they be fulfilled. This therefore that we except a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them for, is, why since they have been fulfilled, the things concerning the Messenger, and <note n="b" place="bottom">See Notes on ch. III.1.</note> 
                  <hi>Eliah,</hi> in <hi>John Baptist,</hi> the things concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord, spoken of, in Christ, they will not yet for all such demonstrations by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of their offices, acknowledge them; but rejecting them, and shutting their eies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst what hath been already fulfilled, look on them as things not fulfilled, and expect both <hi>Eliah</hi> and the Messiah; as here promised, yet to come. But perhaps they will here be ready to retort, and ask why then do Christians yet dissent among themselves, concerning the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of this Prophecy, some of them affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that here is meant <hi>Eliah</hi> in person, and that he is yet to come, as well as any Jews do? It is to be confessed that here is a wider difference betwixt Christians then might be wished there were, though on other grounds then the Jews go. The Jews whether they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it of <hi>Eliah</hi> in person, or any other great Prophet set forth by his name, all drive at this end to prove that the Messiah is not yet come, because no such Prophet hath yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared: against whom we need not add to what hath been said on c. III. v. 1. Their not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging them is no proof that they are not both long since come. The Christians all in this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing that the Messiah or Christ is already come a first time, and shall at the end of the World come a second time, and in this also that <hi>John Baptist</hi> was the promised Messenger sent before him at his first coming, and that he was deservedly called <hi>Elias,</hi> yet in this differ, that some of them do not think that the <hi>Elias</hi> here mentioned is the same with the Messenger before promised, c. III.1. nor the same com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Christ spoken of, that there: but that there, is to be understood his first coming, and <hi>John Baptist</hi> his forerunner at that, but here his second coming to Judgement, and, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Mede</hi> thinks, either <hi>Eliah</hi> in person, or some other called by that name, who shall come before him at that: Whereas others rightly take the <hi>Eliah</hi> here mentioned to be the same with the Messenger there promised to be sent, <hi>viz. John Baptist,</hi> and in both places the same coming of Christ to be meant, <hi>viz.</hi> that usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called his first coming. And this we say is manifestly the truth. It appears by what is spoken by Christ himself in the Gospel, <hi>Mat.</hi> XVII.9. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Marc.</hi> IX.11. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the story of his Transfiguration, where the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>James,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> which he took up into the Mountain with him, after they had heard what <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> talked with him (probably concerning the fulfilling of the Prophecies in this Chapter of <hi>Malachi</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, concerning the approach of the great and dreadfull day of the Lord, wherein he should destroy his wicked obstinate enemies, the unbelieving Jews, and deliver his faithfull Servants that believed in him, out of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, before which it is here said that he would send <hi>Elias</hi> to forewarn them of it, and to preach repentance for the averting of it,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:33128:52"/>
whom they did not discern to be yet <note n="c" place="bottom">As D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Hammond proves on Mat. XVII. note <hi rend="sup">a</hi>, and Luk. IX. note <hi rend="sup">b</hi>, and 2 Pet. I. note <hi rend="sup">c</hi>.</note> come;) asked him, <hi>why then say the Scribes that Elias must first come, and Jesus answered and said un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, Elias truly shall first come,</hi> (or cometh first) <hi>and shall restore all things: But I say unto you, that Elias is come already, and they knew him not</hi> (or acknowledged him not) <hi>but have done unto him whatsoever they listed, &amp;c.</hi> These words, I say, make it so plain that the <hi>Elias</hi> here meant was then already come, and that no other for fulfilling this Prophecy, on which that saying of the Scribes (or Doctors of the Law among the Jews) was grounded, was to be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted before the coming of the great and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full day of the Lord, that there seems to be no place for questioning it. Yet do they, who would have <hi>Elias</hi> that ancient Prophet to be here meant, take hence their chief argument to prove that he here spoken of is not yet come, and therefore that the day here mentioned is likewise to be understood of the day of the last Judgement, before which they expect he shall come, because, say they, it is said in the future, <hi>Elias truly shall first come, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store all things,</hi> as if it were a thing yet to come, but surely the following words, <hi>But I say unto you that Elias is already come,</hi> make it evident that that Interpretation cannot be put on the former, so as to infer from them, that <hi>Elias</hi> is not yet come, but that they must be expounded thus, <hi>It was truly said, Elias shall come,</hi> &amp;c. or, <hi>It is true that Elias should first come</hi> (or was first to come:) and so it appears the Disciples understood it, of whom it is said, vers. 13. <hi>Then the Disciples understood that he spake to them of John the Baptist,</hi> which is a plain proof that they, that understand it of any other, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it not aright. They, though the opinion be ancient, and have many both of note and learning which follow it, (for what end it will not be to our purpose to examine,) may seem (as a great learned <note n="d" place="bottom">Grot. on Mat. XVII.10.</note> man observes) to have taken it rather from some Tradition, that they had heard from the Jews, then to have warrant from the Scripture, or any other good ground for it. Sure the words of our Savior in the place cited, make not for them, but evidently against them, while he concludes all, with af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming that that <hi>Elias,</hi> which they spake of, was already come, not saying that another was to be expected, though one were already come. To the same purpose, as clearly makes what he elsewhere saith, concerning <hi>John Baptist, Matthew</hi> XI.10. <hi>this is he of whom it is written, behold I send my Messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy way before thee,</hi> and vers. 14. <hi>And if ye will receive it</hi> (if ye will receive and believe the truth) this is <hi>Elias</hi> which was to come, (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) spoken there as of the future as well as in the forementioned words, <hi>which shall come,</hi> to shew that he was when the Prophet <hi>Malachi</hi> spake, to come afterward, not that when our Saviour spake he was yet to come: he plainly sheweth, by saying thus, that he was already come. By all this our Saviour makes it manifest, that all that could in <hi>Malachi</hi> be interpreted of <hi>Elias</hi> was made good in <hi>John Baptist,</hi> 
                  <note n="e" place="bottom">Luk. I.17.</note> who came <hi>in the spirit and power of Elias,</hi> and was to be understood of him alone, as much as if he had in express words said, that he only was the <hi>Elias,</hi> that was to come, and they were not by vertue of <hi>Malachi</hi>'s Prophecy, or any other, to look for another. And of him because he is here stiled a Prophet, doth he say, that he was more then a Prophet, <hi>Matt.</hi> XI.9. yea much more, <hi>Luke</hi> VII.26. for (saith he) vers. 28. <hi>I say unto you among those that are born of women there is not a greater Prophet then John the Baptist.</hi> And in <hi>Luke</hi> I.76. <hi>Zacharias</hi> saith of him that he should <hi>be called the Prophet of the Highest,</hi> and all the People were perswaded that he was so, <hi>Luke</hi> XX.6. his denying himself to be that Prophet, who the People asked him if he were he, <hi>John</hi> I.21. shews only that they were mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in their conceit, concerning that Prophet which they asked after, as likewise they were in their question concerning <hi>Elias,</hi> which like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he denyed himself to be, <hi>viz. Elias</hi> in person as they expected, but not that he was he that is here called <hi>Elijah</hi> the Prophet.</p>
               <p>Here the Greek Version instead of Prophet puts the Epithet of <hi>Tishbite,</hi> which was the appellation of the Prophet <hi>Elijah</hi> of old, and by that <note n="f" place="bottom">Rib. Tirin.</note> they who would here have it to be understood of him in person, strengthen their opinion: but sure that adds no strength to it, besides that this is a manifest change of the word in the Originall, which ought to be of greatest authority, there is no doubt but that by the same reason, and <note n="g" place="bottom">Rainoldus de lib. Apocr. praelect. 97. p. 1199</note> figurative way of speaking, he may as well be called <hi>Elijah</hi> the <hi>Tishbite,</hi> as <hi>Elijah</hi> the Prophet, that only shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Countrey of that Prophet, as the other word his office; if he deserved to be called <hi>Eliah</hi> the Prophet, he deserved to be called <hi>Eliah</hi> the <hi>Tishbite.</hi> For that <hi>Eliah</hi> the Prophet whose name because he came in his spirit and power he was called by, was a <hi>Tishbite</hi>: in this there is nothing of force to prove that here, and in the third Chapter, vers. 1. are meant two different <hi>Eliahs.</hi> We conclude therefore from the express words of our Saviour, that he that is meant here by <hi>Eliah</hi> is <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist</hi> and no other, and remit the Reader for what is of him affirmed, and concerns us to know more of what is said of his person, to what hath been spoken on Chap. III.1. That which is added in this verse concerns the time of his coming, <hi>viz.</hi> that he should be sent <hi>before the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:33128:53"/>
coming of the great and dreadfull day of the Lord.</hi> That day is the same which is spoken of, chap. III.2. called there the day of his coming and his appearing, and vers. 17. the day which the Lord shall make (or according to our Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) the day wherein he shall make up his jewels, and in this Chapter ver. I. the day which shall come burning as an oven, and shall burn up the wicked as stubble, but wherein to those that fear the name of the Lord, <hi>the Sun of righteousness shall arise with healing in his wings,</hi> and again ver.

                  </note> the day of the Lord, as shewing more of his power and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, then ordinary daies, though all his. And that day we look upon (as we have before shewed) to be that day or time which should end in the dreadful destruction of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> so comprehending under it (as we have said on ch. III.2.) all the time from Christs first beginning to preach to the Jews to that destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of them and their City. And all this may be called the day of his first coming, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish it from that which is usually called his second coming, <hi>viz.</hi> his coming at the last day to judge all the World. Otherwise if we will more nicely distinguish and confine the day of his first coming to his birth, and the second to his coming at the day of doom to judge the World, this will be to be accounted a middle day or coming between those two (as the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Hammond</hi> calls it on <hi>Mat.</hi> XXIV. ver. 3. and <hi>Luke</hi> IX.31.) for vengeance on his enemies, and deliverance of his Servants.</p>
               <p>But it may seem convenient to comprehend, as we said, all that time from his first manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station till his executing that fearfull National Judgement on the Jews, under one notion of his first coming. For though that which makes these titles of <hi>great</hi> and <hi>dreadfull</hi> is most signally appliable to that day of vengeance; yet all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long in his preaching and foretelling, and threatning them with that doom as certain to come, if they continued obstinate and would not repent, as if it were already present, is that which may deservedly denominate this whole time, a great and dreadful day to them. <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptists</hi> words, wherein he describes it, and forewarns of it, found no less, as <hi>Mat.</hi> III.2. where he begins his preaching with <hi>Repent ye, for the Kingdom of God is at hand,</hi> and ver. 7. <hi>O generation of Vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come,</hi> and ver. 10. <hi>Now the axe is laid to the root of the trees, therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewen down and cast into the fire,</hi> and ver. 12. where he tells them of Christs coming with his <hi>fan in hand.</hi> The day or time thus described is a day of terror, and that so described is the day of Christs first coming then already begun. Our Saviours own preaching and behaviour while he was on Earth was likewise very troublesome to the unbelieving Priests, Scribes, and Pharisees; their quiet by both he disturbes by continual minding them of, and sharply reproving them for, their sins and hypocrisy, and denouncing to them many sad woes for them with severest threats, <hi>ye Serpents, ye generation of Vipers, how can ye es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape the damnation of Hell, Matt.</hi> XXIII.33. and telling them <hi>Behold your house is left unto you desolate,</hi> ver. 38. <hi>i. e.</hi> the <note n="i" place="bottom">D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Hammonds Paraph.</note> desolation of your Temple, City, and Nation is irreversibly at hand, as certainly shall it be as if it were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done.

                  </gap> one stone upon another, because she knew not the day of her visitation, <hi>i. e.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she would not repent upon all his calls, <hi>Luke</hi> XIX.43, 44. and that <hi>generation</hi> he saith <hi>should not pass till all these things were fulfilled, Mat.</hi> XXIV.34. and <hi>Luke</hi> XXI.32. within the the life time of some that there were then alive all that he said should be certainly fulfilled. That time in which these and like dreadfull things were spoken by him who spake as one having authority, as the People acknowledged, <hi>Mat.</hi> VII.29. the Lord himself then on Earth, whose words were as things done, may well be called a great and dreadfull day of the Lord, at least an awfull day, or day to be feared (as <note n="k" place="bottom">Drus.</note> some would have it rather rendred,) how much more when we shall look on it as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded before that generation was passed away, within a matter of 40. years, <note n="l" place="bottom">D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Hammond on Mar. XIII.30. and Luke XXI.32.</note> with the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and total destruction of <hi>Jerusalem</hi>? so that comprehending all that time, both of Christs being on Earth, come in the flesh, wherein he threatned such destruction to the Jews, and of his coming in that short space after his leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Earth, to execute what he had threatned under the name of his first coming, we say that by the day here called <hi>the great and dreadfull day of the Lord,</hi> that is meant. If any shall so distinguish the parts of this time as to call the time of his being on Earth, the day of his first coming, and the destruction of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> a distinct coming from it; that which we say is, that by <hi>the great and dreadfull day</hi> here meant,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:33128:53"/>
seems chiefly to be understood that of <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lems</hi> destruction, though we think it better to joyn both these together under the notion of one day, as we have said, and that which we would evince is, that it is not literally and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily meant of the day of the last Judgement, as divers would have it, especially they who will have by <hi>Elias</hi> to be meant <hi>Elias</hi> in person; the one opinion depends much on the other. A chief argument of such of them as are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, seems that taken from the Epithet it self, given to this day, because it is called a dreadfull day, <note n="m" place="bottom">Bellarm. de Romano Pontifice, l. 3. c. 6. And see Chr. à Castro, and Ribera.</note> which they say is proper to the day of the last Judgement, whereas the day of his first coming is not so called, but an acceptable time and day of Salvation. But sure, by what hath been already said, it appears that the day of his first coming taken as reaching to the destruction of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> (as we do take it) may well so be called, and was indeed so.</p>
               <p>To the same purpose may be added to what hath been said, that which <hi>Simeon</hi> said unto <hi>Mary</hi> when she presented <hi>Jesus</hi> in the Temple, concerning him, <hi>Behold this Child is set for the fall and rising againe of many in Israel, Luke</hi> II.34. that is, as it is well and appositly to our purpose paraphrased by the learned D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Hammond,</hi>
                  <q>is appointed by God to be a means of bringing punishment and ruine upon all obdurate impenitents, and on the other side to redeem, restore, and recover those that will be wrought upon by him.</q>
He that was a <hi>chief corner stone, elect and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,</hi> precious indeed to those that believed, was at once unto the disobedient <hi>a stone of stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, and a rock of offence,</hi> I <hi>Pet.</hi> II.6, 7, 8. such a stone as <hi>whosoever should fall on should be broken, but on whomsoever it should fall, it should grind him to powder, Mat.</hi> XXI.44. and whereas <note n="n" place="bottom">Bell. ibid. See Joh. III.17. and XII.47.</note> they urge in confirmation of their opinion, that Christ at his first coming <hi>came not to judge but to be judged, not to destroy but to save,</hi> we may oppose what he saith, <hi>Joh.</hi> IX.39. <hi>for judgement am I come into this World,</hi> so as to shew that that cannot be so understood, as to contradict this. And that place of <hi>Joh.</hi> XII.47. where he saith he <hi>came not to judge the World,</hi> may, as D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Hammond</hi> observes, be well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, that he came not to accuse; but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is that <hi>the Father committed all Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Son, and gave him authority to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute Judgement, Joh.</hi> V.22, 27. and that as he came for Judgement into the World, so he did execute it being come, both by his preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing while he was among men, <hi>laying the axe to the root of the tree,</hi> and severely putting home the blow at the signal destruction of the unbelieving obstinate Jews, in few years after his departure out of the World, when they who before refused to be judged by him, and to be convinced by his preaching, of their evil waies, and to repent of them, that so judging themselves they might have prevented the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther judgement of the Lord, and thought to prevent that, by judging him, and crucifying him, did by their obstinacy pull it on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and felt the sad effects in so dreadful a manner in that particular Judgement on that Nation, that nothing but that fearful perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole World expected at the last day, can be imagined more terrible: so that that destruction of theirs being comprehended under the day of his first coming (in the way that we have said,) makes it deservedly called, the great and dreadfull day of the Lord, as well as the last day of his coming to the generall Judgement may be so called. And whereas, as they say, that the day of his first coming is called an acceptable day, a day of Salvation, it is to be considered to whom it was so, <hi>viz.</hi> to such as received him with good will as a Savior, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in him, and obeyed him, but to others it was far otherwise, a day burning as an oven to destroy them. In like manner also may that day of the future Judgement be termed, and shall be to the righteous, a day of Salvation, a welcome day, a day longed for by them, and in respect to the certain expectation of which they hold up their heads against all the pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and persecutions, which from ungodly men they suffer before hand, and are by the Apostle bid to comfort one another with those words, I <hi>Thessal.</hi> IV.18. so that in these E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pithetes here put to the day here spoken of, there is nothing which maketh why it may not be attributed as well to the one as to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to that of Christs first coming, as that of his second: and the other circumstances make it evident that it ought to be understood prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily here of the first, however appliable to the second.</p>
               <p>In the Prophet <hi>Joel, c.</hi> II.31. we read of a day of the Lord described in the very same terms, and concerning the day designed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is much the like difference of opinions, as here. <note n="o" place="bottom">Rainold. de lib. Apocryphis prael. 95. and Cameron on Matt. XVII.11.</note> But S. <hi>Peter</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> II.20. manifestly interprets that also of the day of Christs first coming, and so from all which hath been said we conclude that by the great and dreadfull day, before the coming of which the Lord bids them here take notice that he will send <hi>Elijah</hi> the Prophet, is to be understood the day of Christs first coming, which includes his coming in Judgement particularly, against the Nation of the Jews, and ended in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the unbelievers amongst them and of their City, before which <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> designed here by the name and title of <hi>Elijah</hi> the Prophet, was according to this Prophecy sent; and not of his coming to execute the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:33128:54"/>
Judgement on the whole World, at the day of doom, which shall end in the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the whole, farther then as this was a <note n="p" place="bottom">Ibid.</note> type of that, before which that he will send an harbinger, as he did before this, is but the conjecture of <note n="q" place="bottom">Meads discourse on Mar. I.14. &amp;c.</note> those that affirm it, and that for which there is not from these words any evident proof.</p>
               <p>That which hath made me so long to insist on the clearing of this Exposition, even to tediousness, is because the expounding the words otherwise, and as of a thing yet to come, would be to give up to the Jews an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, which ought not to be given up to them. For if it be granted to them that <hi>Elijah</hi> in person be to be expected before the coming of Christ, here spoken of, and that the day here spoken of be not yet come, they will think they have reason to say (as they obstinately do) that the true Messiah is not yet come, and yet to expect another Christ as well as another Messenger; whereas if it be made evident (as we suppose it is) that that <hi>Elijah</hi> here fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told of, is already come, and the day here meant, also come, they can have nothing more but mere obstinacy to pretend why they should not believe in Christ, and forsake that error received from their Fathers.</p>
               <p>Farther arguments for confirming what we have said, the following words also afford, as we shall see in taking them in their order; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we pass to which we may take notice of the Greek rendring the word <gap reason="foreign">

thereof to be discerned and distinguished. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, concerning the appellations and titles of fathers and children, that they are not only at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to those that are so by nature, but to others also, who for other respects or relation one to another, have those names given them; as older people that of <hi>fathers,</hi> younger that of <hi>children</hi>; and so learned men, or teachers, are looked on as <hi>common fathers,</hi> in respect to their <hi>disciples,</hi> or such as learn of them, or are instructed by them, and the like.</p>
               <p>This concerning the nature of those words being observed, will help us to judge of such Expositions as are given of the whole sentence. The signification of the forementioned preposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which our Translators choose to give it in this place, is <hi>to,</hi> or <hi>unto,</hi> which it often ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly hath elsewhere, as <hi>Joshua</hi> II.8. <hi>she came up,</hi>

And it is likewise embraced by most of Interpreters: but then accordingly as they apply it to <hi>fathers</hi> and <hi>children,</hi> and their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent understanding of what is meant by them, do they differ in giving the meaning. They that understand them of such as should be them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in present being, whether natural fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and children, or others who might be called by that title (as ours seem to do) take his office, so as here described, to consist in taking away such discords and differences as should be betwixt them, and settling peace, and love, and charity among them, so as that their hearts should be propense and kindly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectioned one to another, and they should be of <hi>one heart</hi> and one soul among themselves, as it is said of the believers, <hi>Act.</hi> IV.32. and with one consent hearken to God and receive the truth preached to them. So that this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position and behaviour, which it is here said, it should be the work of the promised <hi>Elijah</hi> to work in their hearts, may seem (as a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note n="x" place="bottom">Aben Ezra.</note> Jew observes) contrary to that which in the Prophet <hi>Micah</hi> is described, as being found among them in his time, Chap. VII.6. <hi>the son dishonoureth the Father,</hi> or that which on their not hearkning to him our Saviour saith, should be in after times, <hi>the father shall be divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the son, and the son against the father, Luke</hi> XII.53. Such dissensions among them in those times here spoken of, are <note n="y" place="bottom">See Grot. on the place, and on Luk.

John Baptist</hi> coming in the spirit and power of <hi>Eliah</hi>) should be sent to reduce (if possible) to better order, to mutual agreement among themselves, and joynt obedience to God.

and thus seem the Greek Interpreters to have understood them, who instead of the second member of the sentence, <hi>and the heart of the children to their fathers,</hi> put for the meaning of it, <hi>and the heart of a man</hi> (or every one) <hi>to his neighbour.</hi> Against this Exposition I know not what may be excepted; yet do others, taking the forementioned preposition in the same sense, of <hi>to,</hi> give others: <note n="b" place="bottom">See Ribera, and Lightfoot.</note> some, <hi>he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children,</hi> &amp;c. i. e. <hi>of the Jews to the Gentiles, and of the Gentiles to the Jews</hi>; which though it may be true, and that <hi>John</hi> did so, and it was as well an effect of his preaching and baptizing, as of the Gospell, yet I suppose is not the literall meaning of these words, which were spoken to the Jews, and more particularly concern them between themselves. <note n="c" place="bottom">See R. Tanchum.</note> Others, <hi>he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children,</hi> &amp;c. i. e. <hi>of God to Israel, and Israel to God; who is called their father, and calleth them sons.</hi> That this is comprehended within the latitude of these words we doubt not, inasmuch as we hear the Angel, where he refers to these words, putting as part of <hi>Johns</hi> office, <hi>many of the children of Israel shall be turn to the Lord their God</hi>; and indeed for that end was he to turn their hearts one to another, that they might all with joynt hearts, or one heart, turn to the Lord. Yet can we not think that to be the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral meaning of the present words: God is called their Father elsewhere, but I suppose <hi>fathers</hi> here put in the plural number, cannot be properly used of him.</p>
               <p>Another <note n="d" place="bottom">See L. de Dieu.</note> Exposition of <hi>Camerarius,</hi> who makes the meaning to be, that he should <hi>reduce the hearts of the fathers to the children, and of the children to the fathers, i. e.</hi>
                  <q>Should turn or bring back the hearts of the fathers, so as that they should take care of the pious education of their children, whereas they had been negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in the right instructing and disciplining of them, and the hearts of the children who had been disobedient to their fathers; so as <hi>to yeild due reverence and obedience to them,</hi> may be well reduced to the first.</q>
But as to that
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:33128:55"/>
which <note n="e" place="bottom">Rib. Menoch.

To say that the hearts of the children should be turned by their conversion to the same faith that was in those ancient holy men is intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible; but how the hearts of those so long since dead should be said to be turned to those of that generation, is not so easily conceived: these hitherto mentioned all take <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Al</hi> here in the signification of <hi>to.</hi> There are of the Jews who would have it here to signify <hi>by,</hi> or <hi>by the hand,</hi> or means of; So <hi>R Salomon</hi> out of an ancienter Doctor, <hi>shall turn the hearts of the fathers by the hand of the children, i. e.</hi>
                  <q>Shall speak to the children to perswade their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to embrace the way of the Lord, and on the other hand to the fathers to perswade their children.</q>
The same signification of it takes <hi>Abarbinel</hi> also, and gives this strange in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, making the time spoken of to be according to his fancy after the Resurrection, which he will have to be before the end of the World,
<q>If any be then at that time living who hath children dead, he shall by them, being raised from the dead at the coming of <hi>Eliah</hi> be converted to the truth, and on the contrary such children as are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, by their fathers being raised; that so before the end of the World all may be turned to the truth, that all be not destroyed.</q>
But this is so uncouth an Exposition and so little agreeing to the words, as that it will be much from the purpose to speak more of it, nor doth that by <hi>R Salomo</hi> mentioned agree with them, there being shewed in them what God would do by the hands of his <hi>Elias,</hi> not what <hi>Elias</hi> should do by the hands of others.</p>
               <p>But there is yet another acception of the word, which is by others, both Jews and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, preferred, as giving the plainest mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and that is by taking it here to signify not, <hi>to,</hi> but <note n="f" place="bottom">So an Arabick Transl.

he here spake by his Prophet was spoken of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> and not of <hi>Eliah</hi> in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. And with what <hi>Elias</hi>-like zeal <hi>John</hi> did set himself to perform the office here designed for him, appears by what we read in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of his Mission, and his preaching, and the time thereof, and the contents and effects of it, as <hi>Matt.</hi> III. <hi>Mar.</hi> I. <hi>Luke</hi> III. and <hi>Joh.</hi> I. He that shall duly consider what is in those places said of <hi>John,</hi> and what he did, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them with what is said here of the <hi>Eliah</hi> promised, that he should do; will easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all that is here prophecied to have been already made good; that there will be no ground left to him for expecting a farther completion of it, by <hi>Eliah</hi> in person, or any other under that name to be expected before the coming of the great and dreadfull day of the Lord here spoken of. Here God saith, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I will send Elijah the Prophet</hi>; in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell it is said, <hi>there was a man sent from God whose name was John, Joh.</hi> I.6. and that that <hi>John</hi> was <hi>Elias which was for to come, Matt.</hi> XI.14. Here, that he was to be sent <hi>before the coming of the great and dreadfull day of the Lord.</hi> There the time of <hi>Johns</hi> coming is described that it was when <hi>the Kingdome of God was at hand, Matt.</hi> III.2. when <hi>the day of wrath</hi> was coming, v. 7. when <hi>the axe was laid to the root of the trees, and every tree that brought not forth good fruit should be hewen down and cast into the fire, vers.</hi> 10. when He was now coming whose <hi>fan was in his hand,</hi> and he <hi>would throughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into his barn, but would burn up the chaff with unquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chable fire,</hi> ver. 12. which expressions (as we have before shewed) are an evident description of the <hi>great and dreadfull day of the Lord</hi> here spoken of: Here, that this <hi>Eliah should turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to the fathers,</hi> preach to all sorts young and old conversion and repentance; there in the Gospel, that John <hi>should turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God, and the hearts of the fathers to the children,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> I.16, 17. and that he did preach to all the <hi>Baptism of repentance, Marc.</hi> I.4. <hi>Luke</hi> III.3. and that with such power and good effect <hi>that Jerusalem and all Judea, and all the Region round about Jordan, went out to him, and were baptized of him, confessing their sins, Matt.</hi> III.5, 6. and <hi>Marc.</hi> I.5. <hi>i. e.</hi> multitudes of all sorts and conditions of People out of those places, <hi>Luke</hi> III.7. of the common sort of People; <hi>ver.</hi> 10. of those that might seem to have least of the fear of God before their eies, least regard of, or charity for other men, Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blicans, <hi>ver.</hi> 12.

What can more punctually agree then the Prophecy here, and the matter of fact set down in the Gospels thus paralleled, do, to shew that the person who is here so characte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized in respect to what was to be, and there to what was made good in him, is one and the same, and that no other ought to be expected by vertue of this Prophecy? Certainly when we consider how exactly all things do concurre of what is foretold of in the Prophet, and repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as done in the Gospell, in the one person of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> and how all things here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to be done by this person named <hi>Eliah,</hi> were by him in a signal manner performed; we shall perceive that there is little grounds for that argument which is by <note n="n" place="bottom">Bellarm. de Rom. Pontif. lib. 3. c. 6.</note> some here taken to prove that <hi>Eliah</hi> in person is to be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted before the day of the last Judgement, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause (as they say) <hi>John</hi> did not fulfill all that is here required, in the conversion of the hearts of the fathers and children one to another, or as it is summed up by our Saviour in <hi>resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all things, Matt.</hi> XVII. Not to enquire what other answers may be, or are, given to that objection, abundantly sufficient for confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Exposition which we have follow'd, as to the scope and meaning of them, and to shew that they do not afford any good grounds for any such argument, will be the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of two things which would by those who draw that argument here from them, be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise (I suppose) easily granted. 1. <note n="o" place="bottom">Grot. on Matt. XVII.10. Non tam fructus operae, quam opera ipsa respicitur.</note> That words which are put to import that such or such a thing should be effected by any, do often signify rather his endeavour, and the doing of what would or might be sufficient for the effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of them, then a full accomplishment as to the effect, or consequents on his endeavour. So that what is said that the person here spoken of <hi>should turn the hearts of the fathers to the children</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Matt.</hi> XVII.10. that he <hi>should restore all things,</hi> may well be said to be fulfilled, if he did diligently that which tended to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing, and was sufficient to have produced, such effects, though through default in the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects on which he was to work, the hearts of all were not turned, nor all things, or men (as <note n="p" place="bottom">Hammond on Luke I. note <hi rend="sup">c</hi>.</note> some think it may, though put in the neuter gender, be particularly applied to them) fully rectified and reduced into right order. 2. <note n="q" place="bottom">See him on 1 Cor. note,</note> That the word, <hi>all,</hi> is not alwaies to be taken in that extent as to comprehend every particular (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be applied to persons, things, times, or places) but only a great number, and to shew

                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:33128:56"/>
the diffusive nature, of that which is said should have respect to all, to be such as might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to more, even to all that should come in its way, or be offered to it, or were rightly qualified to receive its operation, or required to make good the truth of what is spoken of.</p>
               <p>To omitt other examples, which are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, one already mentioned, and which is to our present purpose will make it evident. It is said, <hi>Matt.</hi> III.5. that <hi>Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the region round about Jordan went out to John, and were baptized of him.</hi> It will not by any be thought that every person in those places did thus, but a great multitude or store of them, and if more had come, or his preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had prevailed on more, <hi>John</hi> was ready to perform his office to them. This is thought e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to justify the expression, that <hi>all</hi> the Countrey came unto him, and were baptized of him. Here is not in our Prophet the word <hi>all</hi> expressed, but indefinitely, without any number mentioned, said, <hi>shall turn the heart of the fathers and the heart of the children</hi>; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause where Christ summs up what is here said, or gives the meaning of it, he adds it, <hi>viz. and shall restore all things,</hi> it is by them looked on as here understood, and the <note n="r" place="bottom">Bellarm. ut supra.</note> exceptions therefore taken, that by <hi>Elias</hi> is not here meant <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> because to restore all things is to convert to the true Faith all Jews and Hereticks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which <hi>John</hi> did not effect, and therefore <hi>Elias</hi> in person is yet to come, and do it. But if we suppose that <hi>all</hi> is to be here understood, surely that by <hi>all</hi> were to be meant no more then we have said, <hi>i. e.</hi> many of all sorts, all that should hearken to his prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and receive his Doctrine, we may learn from the Angels describing of the same office of his that is here described by this, that <hi>many of the children of Israel he should turn unto the Lord their God, going before him in the spirit and power of Elias to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children.</hi> The <hi>all</hi> and the <hi>many</hi> do then signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the same thing in this matter. And these things being observed, surely by what we read of <hi>John</hi>'s performance, it is evident that the words here spoken of this <hi>Eliah</hi> to be sent, were in, and by him, so far (even to wonder) made good, that to expect another to fulfill them in greater measure, is not warranted by vertue of this Prophecy. He was zealous in the highest degree in performing what he was sent to do, and on very many did his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours take effect. That they did not on more, on all among them without exceptions, prevail, was not through any defect or default in him, but because, as the Scripture expressly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, concerning many of the Pharisees and Lawyers (many of which yet came in unto him) they rejected the counsel of God against themselves, <hi>Luke</hi> VII.30. the like effects w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> our Saviour, who came to convert them all and to save all, complains his own preaching to have had, among that same People through their obstinacy, saying, <hi>O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that killest the Prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as an Hen gathereth her Chickens under her wings, und ye would not, Matt.</hi> XXIII.37. <note n="t" place="bottom">Ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nov. Cameron on Matt. 17.</note> Some are so far from think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that on these words can be grounded any argument to prove that the <hi>Elias</hi> here meant was not <hi>John Baptist,</hi> and that it is one yet to come at the end of the World, before Christs last coming, as that they look on them as an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prove the clean contrary; because this <hi>Elias</hi> is to come before the great day of the Lord, and to call to conversion and repentance; for which was a fit season at Christs first coming: but at the last day of his coming, the day of Judgement, is no farther time for repentance, but for reward or execution of Judgement and punishment; therefore that day, not this, must here be meant, and this <hi>Elias</hi> one already come, not one then to be expected. What we have said will farther be confirmed by consideration of the next words, in which is declared why he should be sent to convert them, <hi>viz. lest</hi> (saith the Lord) <hi>I come and smite the Earth with a curse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As the former words concerning the Mission, the time and the office, of the person here named <hi>Elijah</hi> the Prophet do (as we have seen) exactly agree to <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> and so as that they cannot so be applied to any other, so do these also which declare the end for which he should be sent at that time, to perform that office, no less agree with those in which in the Gospell we are shewed for what end <hi>John</hi> did perform his, by preaching conversion and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, <hi>viz.</hi> That being converted they might <hi>flee from the wrath to come, Matt.</hi> III.7. and the axe being now laid to the root of the trees, they bringing forth good fruit, might escape from being cut down and cast into the fire, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. that they might be as Wheat, and gathered into the Lords Garner, and not as Chaffe which he should burn with unquenchable fire, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. Add how the Angell explains it, <hi>Luke</hi> I.17. that he should, (and as appears, <hi>c.</hi> III. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly did endeavour to do) <hi>turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just.</hi> For what end? <hi>to make ready a People prepared for the Lord,</hi> a People fit to receive him, and to find mercy and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation from him at his coming. Who will not at first hearing or reading perceive, that those things said concerning the end of his preaching,
<note n="s" place="bottom">Matt. III.7</note>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:33128:56"/>
are the very same with what is said here of this person's performing the office he is sent for, <hi>viz.</hi> that he should do it, to prevent, <hi>lest the Lord should come and smite the Earth with a curse,</hi> or utter destruction. The same words which are given, even by some of the Jews, for explication of this expression of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, will as appositely be used for summing up the meaning of those in the Gospell. Such is that Exposition of <hi>R. Tanch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>m</hi> `The meaning, saith he, is,
<q>He shall fairly perswade them, that he may reduce any of them who may possibly be reduced; to wit, such who have not evil habits so firmly rooted in their minds, that they cannot return from them till the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment which shall seize on all the rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious transgressors, overtake them.</q>
Surely this which he gives for the meaning of what is here said of this person here denoted by the title of <hi>Eliah,</hi> for shewing for what end he should perform his office, is manifestly the meaning of what is in the Gospell said, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the end for which <hi>John</hi> was sent to preach repentance, and did preach it, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptize unto it. Not much different as to the purpose, is that meaning which <note place="bottom">Kimchi.</note> another a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them gives of these words, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <q>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he shall warn them, that they may be brought to repentance against that day come, that he may not smite the whole Land, (or the Land with a consumption) and it be a curse.</q>
Thus far, well; and so as to shew the end which this <hi>Eliah</hi> was to aim at, to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together the same that <hi>John</hi> did aim at, and labour to effect, so far as that we cannot but look on him as the person here designed, and have not reason to expect any other for making good, as we have before said, this here spoken. What this last Rabbin adds, They that will not be warned by his admonition, shall be consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and perish in the wilderness of the People, or at the day of Judgement in the Land of <hi>Israel,</hi> doth only shew that he knew not well what to say as to the curse, or destruction here spoken of, when, or how it should be, not willing to understand it of that destruction of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> by the <hi>Romans,</hi> on their rejecting both <hi>John</hi>'s and Christs admonitions, which it is (as we have before shewed) evidently meant of. He knows not on what to fix, and so speaks at random that which signifies nothing, and leaves the Reader in a maze. But if it be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to that, all will run clear, not so if to any other. For against that which (as we have seen) many concurre in, that it should be meant of the day of doome at Christs last coming to judge the World, the form of the expression (as is by <note n="x" place="bottom">Rainolds ut supra, p. 1201.</note> some observed) affords an evident argument, <hi>lest I come, saith the Lord, and smite, &amp;c.</hi> that shews that this judgement might by their repentance and conversion be prevented, which is confirmed by what our Saviour saith, <hi>Matt.</hi> XXIII.37, 38. and <hi>Luke</hi> XIII.34, 35. that therefore their house was left unto them desolate, because they would not be gathered when he would have gathered them, nor be brought to repentance by his call: and that all those evils, and a terrible destruction came up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, because they would not know the things that belonged to their peace, nor the day of their visitation, when they were told of them both by <hi>John</hi> and himself, <hi>Luke</hi> XIX.42, and 44. But that general Judgement is a day that cannot by any means be prevented, but shall in Gods appointed time certainly come, so that <hi>lest I come</hi> cannot be applied to that. For certainly he will come, without any peradventure. As for the explication of the word, <hi>earth, viz.</hi> that by it is here meant the Land of <hi>Judea,</hi> the People spoken to, and of, and not the whole Earth in general is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. <note n="y" place="bottom">See Cameron on Matt. XVII.11. and Hammond on Matt. V.6. and on Rev. VII. <hi rend="sup">a</hi>, and XII. <hi rend="sup">f</hi>.</note> That it is in that restrained significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the Land of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Judea,</hi> pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly often used both in the Old and New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, is a thing so confessed as that there is no need farther to insist on it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abarbinel</hi> seeming to take it more generally thence infers,
<q>That the destruction that is here spoken of should be of things generable and corruptible, such as are on the Earth, not of the Heavens and the Hosts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, (or things therein,) so as it was at the universal Deluge, when God destroyed <note n="z" place="bottom">Gen. VII.4, 23.</note> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very living substance: In summe, all only that was in this lower World.</q>
What he aims at in this inference he doth not farther explain: if he would have it that at the end of the World, only the Earth and the things that are therein should be destroyed, we have to oppose against him that constantly professed truth, <hi>that as well the Heavens as the Earth are reserved unto fire against the day of Judgement,</hi> as S. <hi>Peter</hi> speaks, II <hi>Pet.</hi> III.7. and shall be dissolved therewith; but otherwise, if there be weight in his way of argument, it will make for our purpose, <hi>viz.</hi> that the day here spoken of is not that day of the last Judgement, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is a day of such destruction as was to be executed on Earth only, and therefore in this World, <hi>viz.</hi> (as we have all along said) the destruction of <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the <hi>earth,</hi> or <hi>land,</hi> will easily be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by a most usual notion, <hi>Ahlol ardi, the People of the Earth, or inhabitants of the Land,</hi> (as an Arabick Translation done by a Jew hath it) together with the Land it self. <note place="bottom">See Jerom.

In this place it is manifest that they that render it <hi>curse,</hi> mean the same with those that render it <hi>destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>; not such a lighter curse for correction as is spoken of, ch. III.9. but a curse ending in a final excision and utter destruction. For what is here meant by what is threatned, the event and manner in which it was fulfilled on them to whom it was spoken, makes evident; The generality of the Jews having rejected the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions of <hi>John Baptist</hi> who was sent to warn them <hi>to flee from the wrath to come,</hi> by embracing Christ and his doctrine, whom they not only refused, but procured to be crucified, and pulled on themselves a curse by saying <hi>his blood be on us and on our childhen,</hi> God seconded it with his curse and sent on them that curse which ended in that fearfull destruction of them, and their Land, from which they could never recover, and which makes undeniably manifest to all the World that this Prophecy had its full accomplishment in them, and in vain do they seek to elude it.</p>
               <p>Thus here ends this Prophecy, in the Hebrew Bibles and all that follow them; but in many Copies of the Greek, the verses are so trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed as that the fourth verse being taken out of its place is put after this, <hi>viz.

Behold I will send you Eliah the Prophet before the coming of the great and dreadfull day of the Lord, and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to the fathers</hi>; or at least some of them, so as still to leave out the last harsh words, which conclude with a <hi>curse.</hi> The like do they do in some other Books for the same reason, as at the end of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> and of <hi>Ecclesiastes,</hi> and the <hi>Lamentations,</hi> in which after the last verse, they repeat again the verse going before it.

How ancient this custom was among them I know not: it savors of the humor of those of ancient times among them, who said to Gods Prophets, <hi>prophecy not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things, Isaiah</hi> XXX.10. They seem to think that the putting away from them the mention of <note n="g" place="bottom">Amos VI.3.</note> 
                  <hi>the evil day,</hi> that they might go on in their sins in security, should secure them from it, so inverting and frustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to themselves Gods gracious method, who, that they might not perish in their security, caused those words in the last place to be incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to them, that so they might sink deep into them, and work in them repentance, whereby alone the evil mentioned might be prevented, whereas their refusing to give that attention to them would pull it on them to their unavoidable destruction, as in the example of these here spoken to, it manifestly came to pass so as to be for caution to all in like kind.</p>
               <p>As for the present place, <note n="h" place="bottom">Rainold de lib.

out of what respect soever they do it, we have from the Messiah himself, what to oppose to them, and adde to what they would conclude with, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <note n="i" place="bottom">Matt. XVII.12.</note> 
                  <hi>But I say unto you Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but did unto him whatsoever they listed.</hi> The Messiah also is already come, and they would not know him neither, but rejected him, and despitefully used him: for which their obstinacy, that great and terrible day of the Lord is also come upon them, and he hath <hi>smitten the Earth, i. e.</hi> them and their Land with such a curse, so terrible a destruction as makes good all that is here spoken, and shews that not one word of this Prophecy is fallen to the ground, but hath had its full accomplishment on them; so that now they remain an ensample to all others that shall despise or neglect the means of grace offered to them, as they did, and putting far away the evil day, will not, whiles God gives them space, <note n="k" place="bottom">Luk. XIX.42, 44.</note> know the things which belong unto their peace, nor think of the time of their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitation. For how shall any that reject the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of God against themselves, as they did, (any People or Nation) but expect to be smit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with the like curse as they were, even in this World; how shall the just God, which spared not that his chosen Nation, his once pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar People, the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> his friend, spare others guilty in the like kind? So that though these words were fulfilled in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and the Jewish Nation, the People then peculiarly spoken to and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, yet may all others see in them, what may concern them also, even in this World. But if it should so please God, that any obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately wicked, and impenitent People should escape the like judgement in this World, yet besides that prime and literal meaning of the words, already (as we said) fulfilled, on them, we cannot but by them be put in mind of that more great and terrible day of the Lord, and look on it as by this typified; the judgement of which, none either whole Nations, or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular persons that ever lived shall escape, and which shall unawares seize not on any one Land only, but on the whole Earth and all therein, yea and the Heavens too, with greater terror then that by which this concerning the Jews, is here, <hi>v.</hi> 1. or elsewhere, described, or can by any words be expressed. Wherefore seeing what God hath done, and being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by warned, and by his word certainly assured what he will do, <hi>what manner of persons ought we to be in all holy conversation and godliness</hi>? (as <note n="m" place="bottom">2 Pet. 3.11 12.</note> S. <hi>Peter</hi> will teach us to infer) looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God.</p>
               <p>All those admonitions to the Jews, and all Gods methods toward them for preparing them for that day of his coming here mentioned, equally concern us in respect of that other day of his coming by it typified, and it will be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for us to apply them to our own concerns, and to make use of them to our selves, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out expecting of another <hi>Elias,</hi> to be sent to forewarn and convert us. We have not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of any, and it would be to no purpose to have any. We have <note n="l" place="bottom">Luk. XVI.31.</note> 
                  <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, we have the admonitions of <hi>John Baptist</hi> and Christ himself, and the example of the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage of the Jews for not hearkning to them; and if we will not hear, and be warned by these, neither will we be perswaded if <hi>Elias</hi> or <hi>John Baptist</hi> should rise from the dead, or Christ should come again in the flesh among us to convert us. Sufficient to us to make us to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare our selves for what we are certainly to expect, or leave us without excuse, are those admonitions of his, extending to all Generations, <hi>Watch therefore, for you know not what hour your Lord doth come, Matt.</hi> XXIV.42. and again <hi>v.</hi> 44. <hi>Therefore be ye also ready, for in such an hour as you think not the Son of Man cometh.</hi> There is no generation which can assure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves but that in it may be made good, as to that other day, what our Saviour saith to the Jews concerning the day of their Visitation, <hi>Verily I say unto you this Generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled, Matt.</hi> XXIV.34. <hi>The Lord is not slack concerning his Promise, as some men count slacness, but is long suffering to usward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance,</hi> II <hi>Pet.</hi> III.9.</p>
