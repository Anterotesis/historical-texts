            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. AFter the death of <hi>Mary,</hi> eldest daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Henry the eighth,</hi> had deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Nation (for that time) from an imminent danger of becoming Tributary to the <hi>spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish King</hi> (who ownes none for a naturall Subject, indued with lesse Pride and Austerity then may serve
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60430:13"/>
to face a Tyranny equall to the <hi>Grand Signior's).</hi> And left the Crowne to her Sister <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> not only swept and washed from all Competition or Claimes by the bloud of <hi>Queene Ieane,</hi> but garnished with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause and consent of the people; no less amazed at the huge fires she had daily kindled to devoure the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> then jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of the partiality shewne to the <hi>Priests,</hi> whose exactions were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come no lesse odious in things tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porail, then their latine <hi>Mumsimus</hi> had made them appeare in what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to the worship of God; <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the sixt's</hi> reigne being too short to give them a satiety, or make all the inconveniences appeare, likely to follow so totall a defection from a <hi>Church</hi> reverenced by all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Princes besides. It might be no weak motive to the new <hi>Queene,</hi> so fairely to demeane her selfe at first,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60430:13"/>
that though she entertained the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants</hi> in hope, no perswasions could tempt her to cast the <hi>Papists</hi> into dispaire, till the <hi>Pope</hi> (better seen in the Dignity belonging to his greatnesse, then the Arts his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors had used in their conduct to it) did, by denying her <hi>Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors</hi> a favorable <hi>Reception,</hi> reduce her to a present necessity, of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the <hi>Roman Miter,</hi> or her pretence to that Crowne she had without any considerable oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on so happily possest: There being no way so probable to continue her in power, after the <hi>Popes</hi> so publike manifestation of a blemish in her Birth, as by adhering to a Party which during the Reigne of her Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, did justify in the flames of a hot persecution, That the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his Holinesse was spurious it selfe, and the owners of it no better then <hi>Anti-Christs,</hi> which attempt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60430:14"/>
of hers might possibly have worse succeeded, but for the protection <hi>Philip the second</hi> afforded during the infancy of her power, flattered to it in hope of <hi>Marriage,</hi> no lesse then compelled out of a feare to see <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> possessed by the <hi>Scots,</hi> a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ever in conjunction with <hi>France,</hi> and therefore likely to prove ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant to his affaires. And as these considerations had made him solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous of her safety during his Match with her Sister, they continued still so prevalent as he did not only for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare him selfe, but restrayned o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from making use of that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, so totall a defection could not but afford. Nor was the aspect of a <hi>Councill</hi> then sitting in <hi>Trent,</hi> (to which she omitted not to send her Ministers) of small consequence to her designe; Because not only this nation, but all <hi>Europe</hi> were in the strongest of their labour to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60430:14"/>
a <hi>Reformation;</hi> Though farre short of the pretences of <hi>Luther,</hi> to whose memory the <hi>Queene</hi> had an unappeasable feud, ever since he upbrayded her Father with the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudiation</hi> of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifts Sister: whose birth by this became so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy as to be not only disapprov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Catholickes,</hi> but the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of that profession she meant to establish. Nor were the <hi>Religious bouses</hi> and <hi>lands,</hi> possessed promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuously by those of both tenents, a weak shelter to this new Princesse, looked upon by all as the likeliest and most obliged person to keepe them from reverting to their anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent use; And therefore in hope to be vigorously asserted by the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,</hi> and at worst but weakly opposed by such as had not yet quite relinquished the Roman yoake.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And that the penners of this Story may be as free from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60430:15"/>
of malice as Ignorance, though they acknowledge her ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thrown, then of her selfe fallen from the obedience of <hi>Rome,</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible from the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> used at her <hi>Inauguration,</hi> all purely <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,</hi> and the retention of the <hi>Ring, Crosse</hi> and <hi>Surplice,</hi> contrary to the grayne of her strongest assertors: From whence her ayme may be ghest as not poynting at a greater dissent from the doctrine of <hi>Rome</hi> then her Fathers proceedings had chalked her out; Commanding the <hi>Common prayer book</hi> (which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines most of the <hi>Masse</hi> in english) to be publikely read, And its op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers the <hi>Brownists, Anabaptists, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily</hi> of <hi>Love</hi> with a number of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther crawling errors, the unnaturall heate of <hi>Luthers</hi> difputes had produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced like Insects over all <hi>Germany,</hi> to be restrained under no slighter pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty then Death or Imprisonment.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60430:15"/>
Nor was she tempted to this out of a vainer hope then to draw her neighbour Princes to the same reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lut on, already in dispaire of procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring good from any milder inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours then those of power (The <hi>Roman Courtiers</hi> participating so much of the nature of the Mules they ride on, as they will rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure through a sullen obstinacy, the last extremity, then remoove ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so little out of their track of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and profit; no lesse manifest through all Ages, then in their carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age towards this Princesse and their later proceedings with the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique of <hi>Venice</hi>) From whence more connivance then love, fell to the share of the <hi>Puritans,</hi> that abhor'd the lenity of the Queene, in not coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancing such as bent their force a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> (betwixt which and the <hi>Court</hi> there may be a wider difference then our grosser dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60430:16"/>
will suffer us to discerne) from whose practice, though some desired a <hi>Reformation,</hi> a farre greater part thought it damnable to reject it quite: few yet acknowledging any <hi>Descent</hi> or <hi>Ordination</hi> but what was derived from the <hi>Catholike Church,</hi> a terme of too great a Latitude to be concealed for a day, much lesse for whole ages as many indeavour to prove. But leaving these dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes to Dr <hi>Iuell</hi> and the rest of her Divines (at that time better able to play the Scholars prize, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny amongst the Fryers, were found in their Answers) Her Iuncto, in which she had a choyce number con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of both Factions, did think it prudence not to stray farther then the inexorable necessity of the time compeld, from that union of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which had a <hi>Councill</hi> to vouch, That <hi>no faith was to be held with any but themselves;</hi> which must have
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60430:16"/>
rendered all her Leagues voyd or uselesse to the very Oaths she took of her Subjects: yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding these Shackles she spunne out a long and as happy a Raigne as ever this Nation did injoy.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 The precedent Reasons joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forces with the deplorable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition she lived in during the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of her Sister, and meeting with so Fortunate a Catastrophe, caused a no lesse consternation in the hearts of the <hi>Papists</hi> (already much broken and unsetled in their passage through so many suddaine and unexpected changes) then it produced joy in those of the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> who apprehending her <hi>suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse</hi> as issuing out of the immediate care God had of their affaires, became so farre incouragad and sedulous, that whilest the other party stood amazed in an expectation which way this new Princesse would incline,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60430:17"/>
the ensuing <hi>Parliament</hi> was wholy made up of such persons, as had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready voted in their words and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons every thing the Queene could desire to have confirmed in the House: so as no side but were mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in their account, the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi> gaining more, and the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks</hi> lesse then could be expected, to the taking the title of <hi>head of the Church,</hi> and conferring it on her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, which was thought unsutable to her Father and Brother, and therefore farre more unbecoming the person of a Woman; the cause a <hi>Declaration</hi> was not long after is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued out, to shew in what senses it was to be understood. And to prove they more intended the limitation of the <hi>Roman power:</hi> then to secure themselves from Tyranny at home, an <hi>Act</hi> was passed inabling the <hi>Queene and Commissioners</hi> for the time being, to alter or bring what

                     <hi>Ceremontes</hi> or <hi>Worship</hi> they thought decent into the service of God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out excepting that formerly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded: whereby a returne, (like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyest to be made use of) or a farther remoove was left arbitrary at the will of the Queene: whose succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors not being mentioned in the Act, left roome to question, It ought to be no longer in force then her life. For whose gratification a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone her Privy Counsell (that did then and indeed almost all her time governe Parliaments) had intended it.

to assume the <hi>Title and Armes of England</hi> very unseasonably du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her husbands sicknesse, and before her owne Kingdome was setled, or any considerable force manifested, in her favour: It not pleasing <hi>France</hi> it selfe (of whose King she was after the Relict) to see all <hi>Britanny</hi> united under one Crowne: and from whence dropped so much of the venome of Iealousy into the hearts of <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and her Counsell, as no meanes was left unsought likely to distresse her, especially by the <hi>Puritan party,</hi> whose safety lay in her destruction, and who shunned no undecency car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying any probability of being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentall in her remove; forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that the persons of Princes have been thought by all wise men too sacred to have any hand or Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice appeare in their death but Gods.

waies to destroy her, so there was as considerable a Faction in the <hi>English Court</hi> that desired her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, the cause not only that held her long captive (many wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her restraint that abhorred her execution) but deterred all who had either estate or honour to loose, from attempting in their owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, or conniving at any other like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be so wicked as to make her away: though our Queene may be found in many of her Letters inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating so much to such as kept her, who were so wise as not to understand what was meant, else they might have fallen into the fortune of <hi>Davison,</hi> who unadvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly ventering between the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and safety of his Prince, was ground to nothing betwixt the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of one party and shame of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Thus because no body either would or durst do it alone, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60430:22"/>
was intayled upon the whole Nation, by the apparition of a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall and counter feit Iustice: Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of State in such nice points as these, being so contrary to that in the Schooles, as it is most safe and honourable when it hath the least Authority to vouch it. And if the Actors of this Tragedy had not found more security from the long reigne of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> then the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause they had from <hi>Scotland</hi> was able to have afforded them upon the next change, I believe so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their race had not sate in the house of Lords.

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60430:29"/>
most likely to be tug'd a ground; Not wise enough to apprehend Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things he found inserted in his Patent, as <hi>liberty to Pardon or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the Irish Rebells sutable to his owne will, and power to reward with lands or honours all he esteemed wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi> were such flowers of the Crown as his enemies (to the disadvantage of whose friends he might imploy them) could not in reason but have found cause to oppose, had they been pick'd out for any milder de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe, then to deck a <hi>Garland</hi> for that head they meant to sacrifice to their malice and revenge. But this being acted (though long before studied) amongst the last Scenes of her Tragedy, I shall deferre the conclusion till some other time, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring here (according to my weak fancy; prompted only by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port) to draw a <hi>prospect of her Court:</hi> where, all her raigne, <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty</hi>

And because this was Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry at the will of the <hi>Greene cloth</hi> (a Court only intending <hi>Provision</hi> and <hi>Carriages)</hi> The <hi>Purveyors,</hi> upon whom lay the execution, And so by consequence the envy, were, if guilty, at the mercy of every accuser, being not seldome hang'd or put in the Pillory upon the discovery some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of small abuses: Her Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment appearing so full of policy, as
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60430:30"/>
she was rarely found to interpose the power of the Crowne in her owne cause: Who by turning her face to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the sinnes, and countenancing the punishment of such Harpies, did besides stop the future current of their Corruption; Through which she became not only better serv'd, but gained an opinion of Iustice, and Mercy towards her people: it being the male-administration, more then badnesse of any Office, I ever knew during her raigne or her Successours, legally erected, that raised murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the people, the il-boding voice of Sedition; which if heard, is not to be neglected, but like the Sea stopped by the bankes of Iustice; for if once it growes epidemicall, all indeavours do rather inflame then moderate it, as thought to proceed more from necessity then love.</p>

Princes the Sun ever looked upon without blushing in relation to Oppression or Blood: This may be allowed upon the score of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, That <hi>his</hi> Lordship would hardly have been so <hi>rampant</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civill</hi> without some extraordinary invitation, as to draw a <hi>blow</hi> in her presence from an other <hi>Privy-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellor,</hi> more zealous possibly than discreet, to whom when the Queen sayd, <hi>He had forfieted his hand;</hi> his reply was, <hi>he hoped she would suspend that iudgment, till the Traylor had lost his head, who did better deserve it:</hi> But this accident bordering so neere the confines of her Honor did admit no farther debate; it being no other than she in a lesse spright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full humor might have given him her selfe, none being more flexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to all kind of Iollities than the mindes of Princes when unbent from publique affaires.

by denying the <hi>Parliament</hi> all farther debate of <hi>Ecclesiasticall cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,</hi> And shewing them their no lesse injustice than levity to question what they had so firmly estated in her Person, who was yet resolved to introduce no more than what was lately confirmed by themsesves, or their Fathers; so notorious to all, as the Doctrine professed most ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally in <hi>England</hi> bore in forraigne nations the name of <hi>Parliament-Faith.</hi> Nor was this her prudent restraint looked upon with any great reluctancy by any but <hi>Cartwright</hi> and some such adle heads, whose Iudgments were trimmed according to the Mode of <hi>Amsterdam;</hi> of whose distempered passions the <hi>Queen</hi> made so much advantage, as to keep the <hi>Church</hi> humble and quiet whilest she gelt their <hi>Sees</hi> by exchanges, and other mortifications of their power and estates, which

during her life were not suffered to blaze out in their <hi>Ecclesiasticall offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> as since they did: which is the only visible cause can be given, why so much worth as resided in this Princess is so little celebrated.

I have not seldome my selfe heard them wish a returne to the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> under the title of <hi>the old Learning:</hi> Not so well pleased with the <hi>saving doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Protestant</hi> profession, as they formerly were under the more liberall distributions of the <hi>Monasteries.</hi> Nor was it the guise of thse prudent times to <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve Parliaments</hi> in discontent (by which a quarrell seemed to be pitck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the whole nation) But to <hi>adjourne</hi> them in Love.

their Prince only in hope to be bought off. And for such as desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a farther recoyle from the <hi>Pope</hi> than was thought fit to be made, they were not so numerous or well agreed yet, as to actuat any distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance, being for the most part poore, and, as all <hi>Schismatiks</hi> doe at first, glorying more in Suffering, than in any other opposition but what they are able to raise with their pennes or tongues, in which they were no lesse lavish than bold and indiscreet: yet meeting from the most in power only blame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, they sought out new ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations for themselves and vents for their opinions in <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> where the <hi>Dutch</hi> alowed a generall <hi>Mart</hi> for all <hi>Religions</hi> (the <hi>Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> excepted) without any nicer li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation than obedience to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate in things purely Civill. And by this they did not only draw much

of our <hi>coyne</hi> thither, but our <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifactures</hi> of <hi>Weaving, Dying, Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, Spinning</hi> and <hi>Dressing of Cloth, Stuffe &amp;c:</hi> Easy to have been prevented, by affording them an <hi>Amsterdam</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> some small <hi>City of Refuge,</hi> over which her Majesty might have set a discreet <hi>Governour</hi> with a <hi>Garison,</hi> whose charge they would willingly have borne, besides the payment of a large excise for their folly.
