            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have not forborne either out of forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, or guiltineſſe, to ſend forth theſe <hi>Expreſsions</hi> thus publiquelie, though I confeſſe, <hi>they</hi> are of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in the which I have ſo litle dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as, I may rather give advantage, to ſuch as would be ready to ſeeke it; then ſatisfaction, to thoſe, that would be pleaſed to take it.</p>
            <p>I was willing to take this Nationall <hi>Covenant,</hi> that bindes up theſe Kingdomes in ſuch an unity, and in ſo happy an agreement. And likewiſe to paſſe through any <hi>tryall,</hi> that ſo may Actions might be laid open, <hi>before</hi> this diſcourſe, That thereby it might find the more credit. And I do paſsionatly wiſh,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:111055:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 88 -->that the <hi>thoughts</hi> and <hi>intentions</hi> I caryed to <hi>Oxford</hi> could likwiſe be <hi>ſoe;</hi> Which ſince they cannot, nor paſſe by any other Conveyance, to the knowledge of ſuch, as I deſire to ſatisfie, I ſhall here freely, and faithfully <hi>expreſſe</hi> them.</p>
            <p>Though I have ever, both in my pious duties, and my naturall reaſon, wiſhed, and endeavoured, to ſee this Kingdome reſtored to the comforts, and reſt of <hi>Peace,</hi> yet, was I never ſuch a ſeeker of it, as to deſire to find it, without thoſe bleſsings, we have endeavoured to procure with it, of <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>true liberty,</hi> agreeable to the Condition of free, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dejected Subjects; Yet, ſuch were my <hi>hopes,</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, (made ſo, by many publique relations, and diſcourſes from <hi>Oxford,</hi> as they were even, formed into an <hi>opinion</hi>) That upon a free, and faithfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation to his Majeſty, of the ſad, and deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable condition of his Kingdomes of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> he might have beene perſwaded, to have <hi>Offered,</hi> even thoſe things, from his owne <hi>reaſon,</hi> or <hi>Wiſdome,</hi> that we for our <hi>neceſsity,</hi> and <hi>Conſervation</hi> have often, and humbly <hi>petitioned</hi> him for. And when this was made, not onely <hi>poſsible,</hi> but <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,</hi> unto mee; I did conceive my ſelfe not to bee the <hi>unpropereſt perſon</hi> to repreſent theſe things

            <p>But I ſhall ſay no more in this way, ſince, as it leades towards <hi>my ſelfe,</hi> even <hi>Truthes,</hi> thus looking <hi>homeward,</hi> may, abroad, be looked upon as <hi>vanities;</hi> Otherwiſe, there are many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, that would ſhow my <hi>Counſells</hi> to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, and my <hi>imployments from</hi> him, to have been ever expreſſed, and governed, with great Fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to this Kingdome.</p>
            <p>Theſe faithfull, and free <hi>Councells,</hi> made me hope, His Maieſty, with ſome reaſon, and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, might have reflected, and looked backe upon my uſuall adviſes unto him, and from
