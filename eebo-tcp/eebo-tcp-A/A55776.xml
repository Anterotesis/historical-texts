            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Madam,</hi> as I did always, and ever shall sincerely Honour Your Grace, so I beseech God to Bless You with all Spiritual Blessings; and that to those for this Life, he would add the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings of Children to inherit them. <hi>Madam,</hi> I ask leave to be</p>

                  <bibl>1 Corinth. 10.10.</bibl>
                  <p>Neither murmur ye, as some of them also mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur'd, and were destroyed of the Destroyer.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>BEcause His Majesties Declaration represents to us the Methods contrived by Malevolent men to destroy his Sacred Person, and his Royal Brother, and subvert his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which of all Governments that are nigh or known unto us, is the most easie to the Subject, not excepting the Democratical, so admired of late, but falsely as factiously called Common-wealths, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusive of Kingdoms, where the Soveraigns are not the sole Proprietors. And of all Soveraign Princes known to us, his present Majesty hath been most kind and indulgent to his People, as many of them have owned by their publick Addresses, which were seasonable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrances of their Loyalty. Withal, the Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on notifies to us, what must have been the ill conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of the Conspiracy, had it taken effect.</p>
            <p>I have therefore chosen to discourse to you from this Text, wherein the Apostle bids the murmuring <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> look back upon the murmuring <hi>Israelites</hi> in the wilderness against their Leaders, who had soon forgot their long oppression, and cruel bondage in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and their miraculous deliverance from it by the hands of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> as soon as we have forgot the Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of a long Civil War, and the heavy oppressions that we felt and complained of, from usurping Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101676:4"/>
and our deliverance from them by the most happy Restauration of our King, where the hand of God was most eminently seen, as eminently as any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane record can produce, would I allow my self time to survey it in all it's circumstances, or were it for me proper now to do it.</p>
            <p>But scarce was our Soveraign restored, and with him our Laws and Religion, and Peace at home, but we were discontented at our own happiness.</p>
            <p>Neither the sense of a Natural Allegiance, nor the Sacred Tyes of Oaths, nor Preferments, nor Honours, nor Riches, could keep some men in the dutiful station of Subjects; who from a false esteem they had gained for their wisdom and integrity to their Countrey, as Patriots of it, had inveigled great Parties to tread in the same footsteps of Disloyalty, and to use the same measures to disturb the Throne, and so our Peace, as before had been done in the late Kings days: all the same, with the additional contrivance of the <hi>Black Box, &amp;c.</hi> which were so publickly taken notice of, that the late Lord Chancellour spake to this purpose to both Houses of Parliament, <hi>That he hoped they would not see Three Kingdoms twice destroyed in one Age, by the same Methods.</hi> Examples are cogent Arguments; if men are in their wits, they will not fall into the same pit, into which they have seen others fall before them; even beasts will not do it, be the bait what it will. So St. <hi>Paul</hi> would have the <hi>Corinthians</hi> take warning from the <hi>Israelites,</hi> whose Murmurings and Discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents are recorded in Scripture, and recorded there not only to upbraid their ingratitude, but as the Apostle speaks, <hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>These things happened to them for ensamples</hi>; and they are <hi>written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come. Neither murmure ye as some of them,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:101676:4"/>
               <hi>Solomon</hi> gives a Caveat, <hi>Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were better than these?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccles. 7.</note> 
               <hi>for thou dost not inquire wisely concerning this matter.</hi> The mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring Questionists of his age had the like before them; and they have been since, and ever will be: so long as time is, men will complain of the times; and the little portion of happiness that God gives us in this life, is disturbed by our own restless and repining nature, by comparing the present with the former; and because the former is past, it is therefore better. Any little petty accident at present, doth more disturb us, than a load that is past and gone off our Shoulders. <hi>Israel</hi> was under the miraculous protection and deliverance of Heaven, but wants some little convenience; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently we read of a loud and clamorous murmuring; <hi>Would to God we had died in Egypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The hard bondage they had felt in <hi>Egypt,</hi> was gone off now; and the want but of a meals meat in the wilderness, put them to murmur against God and their Governours.</p>
            <p>As if it were not enough that <hi>man was born to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as the sparks fly upward,</hi> but we adde sparks to the fire.</p>
            <p>When we are Children, and under the Discipline of the Rod, we complain, that we were not born sooner, and past the correction of our Master; and when we are old, we think, we were never so happy as when we were Children: indeed we are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. The phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies that pleased us, we are soon weary of, and seek for new; something it is that would please us better, but what it is we know not.</p>

            </p>
            <p>This is not only a froward distemper, whereby we create miseries to our selves; but 'tis a sin too, though but little taken notice of; yea, a heavy provocation, by
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101676:5"/>
which we draw Gods Judgments upon our heads. This was the sin of <hi>Israel</hi> in the Text, and ranked among the great sins of <hi>Idolatry, Fornication,</hi> and <hi>tempting of God</hi>; and derives punishments as great as these do. The Text hath these parts.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The sin set down, that is <hi>Murmuring.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. The sin exemplified in <hi>Israel; As some of them murmured.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. The severe punishment of this sin, in the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digm or Example, <hi>Were destroyed of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyer.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>4. The like judgment threatned to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> if they did continue in <hi>Israels</hi> example; implyed in the Prohibition, <hi>Neither murmur ye.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">I. To consider something of the nature of this sin <hi>murmuring:</hi> The word in Greek seems to be framed by the voice of Nature, and to be significant of every thing that creates discontent; a peevish, quarrelsome, nay too, an irrational distemper. A word, say some, taken from the grunting of a Swine, whose eyes are bigger than their bellies; that though there be Wash enough in the Trough, yet hunch each other with their heads, as if enough would not come to their share.</p>
            <p>'Tis a sin of a secret and specifick malignancy; I know not to which of the Commandments I may refer it, unless it be to the tenth, <hi>Thou shalt not covet. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness is the root of all evil:</hi> the Apostle instanceth in <hi>the love of Money</hi>; but the object of Covetousness is, as it self, infinite, it hath no bounds nor period. <hi>The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear with hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>; and the mind of man is not so soon satisfied as his sense: Take it regularly in the pursuit of knowledge,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101676:5"/>
which is as the exaltation of his nature, there is still an <hi>ultra progredi</hi>; the most knowing may know more, and desires to do it: but when the mind is debauched, as <hi>Israel</hi>'s once was, given up to its own lusts, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the object is infinite as well as the desire, but its me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diums are folly, and its end is ruine. The wicked man is well compared to the <hi>troubled Sea, that casts up mire and sand:</hi> and the stronger the tempest, the thicker are the waters. The wickedness of murmuring hath a specifick influence on this Sea, to cast up dirt and filth.</p>
            <p>To give then this Discourse a body, and to represent unto you the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or Murmurer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He is a Heretique. St. <hi>Iude</hi> speaks of false tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers in general, that <hi>they are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; their mouth speaketh great swelling words, having mens persons in admiration because of advantage.</hi> A jugling sort of Hereticks murmur and complain, and yet flatter too; cunningly sift out, who they can make for their Party, so as to disturb the Church.</p>
            <p>Such men softly instil the venom of their Principles, and so bring about their ends, not by strength of their Arguments, (for that cannot be done) but by a sleighty insinuating themselves into mens affections, complying with their humours, and admiring their persons; and so take advantage to convey their odd and false conceits.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Inquietae Haereticorum curiositates,</hi> said <hi>Tertullian</hi>; they are always restless, and always prying; creep in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to houses, and then into affections, till their murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring discontents at last break out into open Factions. So</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Murmurer is certainly the State-sinner: the little grudgings that begin in Princes Courts, are soon
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101676:6"/>
spread into the Countrey; and they are like the Poets <hi>Fama malum,</hi> the farther the same goes, the greater it grows. The murmuring discontents in the State, at last break out into open Rebellions. The <hi>Israelites</hi> said, <hi>As for this Moses, we wot not what is become of him</hi>; the next thing we hear of them is, they <hi>make a molten calf,</hi> that is, set up a Religion and Government of their own. <hi>The Tongue is a little Member,</hi> saith St. <hi>Iames,</hi> but 'tis <hi>a great evil</hi>; and the murmuring tongue, sets the State 'tis in on fire; and Hell-fire shall be the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of such tongues.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Murmurer is ever an envious person, and so an ill Member of a Society; disquiets the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood he lives in, and, as <hi>Theophrastus</hi> observes of him, quarrels at good Offices done him by his Friends, and saith they could do no less, and that they were more kind to others: and if he chance to find Money in the way, he soon forgets it; and says, when another after chances to find Money, that he could never have any so good luck. 'Tis a distemper called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a complaining without a cause; and the envious man al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways doth this. 'Tis a nature that makes a near ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to the Devils; the prosperity of <hi>Iob</hi> is an eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sore.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He is the malicious man, delights to do mischief where he lives; is a trouble to himself, and will be a trouble to his Neighbour; and therefore no wonder if punishment doth attend him: for he is ranked by <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> among the <hi>seven abominable things that God hates,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 6.19.</note> 
               <hi>him that soweth discord among brethren</hi>; so that if his hands be too short, his tongue shall be long enough.</p>
            <p>In short, a Murmurer is he that is every thing that is mischievous. Blasphemes God, the King, the Church, and his Neighbour; and he is a burthen to the earth, and to himself. Neither good nor bad weather pleases
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101676:6"/>
him: complains in War, and yet is discontented in Peace; pines away in scarcity, and yet repines at plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: when 'tis summer, he longs for winter; and when 'tis winter, wisheth for summer. Neither times nor manners please him; and could he call for them at his pleasure, yet would murmur still: of which we have a full instance in the Text.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The Example, <hi>As some of them murmured.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> being to disswade the <hi>Corinthians</hi> from this sin of Murmuring, as from others there mentioned, prefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the dehortation with a compendious account of Gods mercies to <hi>Israel: I would not have you ignorant, Brethren, that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea, and were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud, and in the sea; and did all eat the same spiritual meat, and did all drink the same spiritual drink; (for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them, and that rock was Christ.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Holy Ghost intending by the Apostle to upbraid the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and that for their ingratitude for so many mercies multiplied upon them, in stating a parallel between them and <hi>Israel:</hi> and indeed their mercies were greater than <hi>Israels,</hi> for as much as the substance is better than the shadow. They tempted Christ in a Type, but these more plainly wantoned it with the mercies of the Gospel: The <hi>Israelites</hi> were prophane, when they did <hi>eat of that spiritual meat,</hi> and <hi>drank of that spiritual drink</hi>; but the <hi>Corinthians were much more,</hi> when they <hi>did not discern the Lords bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> and so did desecrate and unhallow that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>But to consider distinctly and briefly this sin of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael. The people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 15.24.</note> The waters of the place were bitter,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101676:7"/>
either naturally, or by Divine appointment, to try them; and because they were so, a clamour was rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and their Governours must hear of it: <hi>What shall we drink?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next Chapter they murmur for Meat, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they did for drink; <hi>the whole Congregation murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness:</hi> a Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal sin, <hi>the whole Congregation</hi>; and that both against their Prince, and against their Priest. But because this Murmuring was more loud than the former, more combined and National; 'tis called, <hi>Gnal Adonai telun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothechem,</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Your murmurings are against the Lord,</hi> and God looked upon it as done against himself. <hi>The glory of the Lord appearing in a cloud</hi> whilst they were in this contest with their Leaders,<note place="margin">v. 10.</note> determined the case; <hi>The Lord spake unto Moses, I have heard the murmurings of the Children of Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And are they better yet? No: in the next Chapter, they are at the same trade again; they want Water to their Manna, they had in the last. <hi>The People did chide with Moses: Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us out of the Land of Egypt, to kill us and our Children?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their murmuring now had broke out into down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right and impudent revilings; they chide, and that to the purpose; and therefore <hi>Moses called the name of the place Massah and Meribah, because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the Lord, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Is the Lord among us, or not?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will leave you to judge whether we have not thus tempted God. We are querulous and complaining up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every exigencie, and our Governours must hear of it with both ears. Ill men, who have private designs of their own to carry on, will always be complaining of publick Affairs: and their complaints may sometimes seem so plausible, that they may gain Proselytes to their
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101676:7"/>
Faction, some of whom may not mean so ill, as they do. For, with what plausible pretenses did the Serpent of Discord and Rebellion beguile many thousands? What more plausible, indeed more honourable, than to engage in a War for the defence of King and Parliament? 'Tis the constitution of our Government, and a happy one it is, if we did well understand it: our Laws propounded by our selves in Parliament, and ratified by our Kings, are our proper freedom as English Men; and the due execution of them, is our safety: and they are State-Malignants indeed, that will not contend for this. But the cunning and ambitious men, that framed the plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form of our following Miserys, fixed that odious name of <hi>Malignants</hi> upon all those, who adhered to the King, and the known Laws, and would not run to the same excess of Riot and Madness with themselves. After the same manner now, they are stigmatiz'd with the more odious name of <hi>Tory's,</hi> who have signified their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution to stand by the established Government, and will not be seduced by Popish and Fanatick contrivances: for their eyes are open, by woful experience, to know and discern the aims of Seducers. But he, or they, who gave them the name of Torys, did design their ruine by it, as if they were not fit to have so much as protection from the Government. For Torys are in <hi>Ireland</hi> the <hi>Out-laws,</hi> as the <hi>Banditi</hi> in <hi>Italy.</hi> I remember the time when Parliament-Souldiers, as they would be called such, did Plunder the Houses, and take away the Horses of honest Country-men, who lived peaceably at home, because they were Malignants. The name of Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant did warrant the Plunder. But the Tory deserves the Gallow's: so we see what quarter we must expect from some men, if they could compass their ends to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinge the Government. Government is from God, and so sacred, whether it be in Church or State; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101676:8"/>
Kings and Priests, who are the Ministers of it, are sacred persons, and were always esteemed so, till the Serpent in Paradise, who presented the bait of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality to <hi>Eve,</hi> ensnared us with the like, viz. <hi>freedom</hi> and <hi>liberty of Conscience</hi>; both which we do measure with our own Rules.</p>
            <p>I need not tell you the effects of those murmurings and complaints that brought the late Civil-Wars a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, about forty years since; the decoy to engage many thousands was to fight for King and Parliament; but it ended in the ruine of both. Our Zeal now is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Popery; I beseech Almighty God, with all the sincere Devotions that I can send up to Heaven, that an indiscreet Zeal among some, too many, be not the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to bring it in: but to keep it out from re-entring, as a National Church, none can ever be more concern'd in interest than a King of <hi>England</hi>; this is our great secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, so long as we can enjoy a lawful King, and him in peace at home, for Popery cannot enter but by strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Factions.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Part of the Text, The severe punishment of this Sin of murmuring, in the Paradigme or Example: <hi>Were destroyed of the destroyer.</hi> The first punishment was a fire, that brake out from the Lord, and consumed some of them.<note place="margin">Numb. 11.</note> 
               <hi>When the people complained, it displeased the Lord, and the Lord heard it, and his anger was kindled, and the fire of the Lord burnt among them, and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the Camp:</hi> Bemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonnim, in the very fact, when they complained. The occasion is concealed in the Text: but it was, say the Jews, from the mysterious reversion of the letter Nun, when they would conspire to go back to Egypt. The fire fell on <hi>the uttermost parts of the Camp</hi>; that is, that which should have led the Van for their retreat to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101676:8"/>
               <hi>The fire of the Lord,</hi> (to speak in the Hebrew Idiom) a very great fire, fell not many years since up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Metropolis, if I may not say a fire from the Lord; for all disastrous casualtys depend upon his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, without which a Sparrow falls not to the ground.</p>
            <p>The next punishment for Israels murmuring is for their desire after flesh:<note place="margin">Numb. 11.4.</note> 
               <hi>The mixt multitude that was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them fell a lusting, and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>mixt multitude</hi> were those Nations gathered up in their march, as we may probably conjecture with <hi>Grotius:</hi> God was oft jealous over Israel, for the evils he foresaw would accrew to them from other Nations, and therefore by many repeated Laws did forbid their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with them. This <hi>mixt multitude,</hi> call them A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabians, for that the word imports, soon drew in the whole body of <hi>Israel</hi> into the same sin:<note place="margin">v. 33.</note> 
               <hi>the people weep throughout their Familys,</hi> and call for flesh; they had it, but they had it with a vengeance;<note place="margin">v. 10.</note> for, <hi>while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of the Lord was kindled against the people, and the Lord smote the people with a very great Plague.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Truly we have not asked meat for our lusts, as Israel did, but we have had it without asking, and plenty hath oft been our complaint.</p>
            <p>The next murmuring was occasioned by <hi>the Spys bringing up an evil report upon the Land of</hi> Canaan. They <hi>dyed of the Plague before the Lord, and the Carcases of those Murmurers fell, and never entred the Land of promise,</hi> Numb. 14. But <hi>Chap.</hi> the 16. <hi>Corah</hi> and his Complices enter into an open Conspiracy against <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi>; they <hi>perish in an Earthquake; and two hundred and fifty by fire from Heaven,</hi> who <hi>offered up strange fire: The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple cryed, and fled, lest they also should perish.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:101676:9"/>You would think that their mouths were shut up from murmuring any more, as the earth had shut up those Rebels in her Womb. No: they had but slept upon the judgment, and they had forgot it as a Dream: <hi>On the morrow all the Congregation murmur against Moses and Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the Lords people.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> were none, the Prince and the Priest, because they were not of their Faction. God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, and bids <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> withdraw, <hi>that he might consume the Congregation in a moment.</hi> It was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded so before, in the case of <hi>Corah:</hi> but there, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and Aaron fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the Spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be angry with the whole Congregation?</hi> they had then something to plead; they had nothing now, but fell upon their faces, and by a silent prostration deprecated the justice of the vengeance: it was a more universal Mutiny of the people against their Leaders; and <hi>there dyed of them,</hi> as in the twinkling of an eye, <hi>fourteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand and seven hundred of the Plague</hi>; and had it not been for the hasty charity of <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Censer <hi>interposing between the living and the dead,</hi> they had all perished.</p>
            <p>If they, who did but whet their tongues against their Governours, fell thus; what do they deserve, who bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed their Swords in the bloud of our late King? a Murder, by the mockery of Justice, never to be forgot, yet never to be mentioned without horrour and detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But what do they deserve, who would have justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that fatal murder by the assassinating of our present Soveraign, and his Royal Brother? as if the murthering of Kings by these Casuists was excepted from the sixth Commandment. When froward men do take a liberty to speak, Write, and Print what they please, and all with designes against the Government they live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, 'tis plain that they would be Governours them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:101676:9"/>
and when they have whet their tongues, and sharpned their pens, they are not far off from drawing their Swords; then the mischief is compleated, the <hi>Sin is fulfilled,</hi> and it <hi>brings forth death,</hi> and none knows how long it will reign.</p>
            <p>I shall stop here, either to any farther instances of Israels sin or punishment. But before I proceed to the 4th. part of the Text, let me try to inform my self and you, why this sin hath this punishment. The Murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is said to be <hi>destroyed of the Destroyer</hi>; that is, by some more remarkable and immediate hand of venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: and why so?</p>
            <p n="1">1. Because by what appears, this Sin of murmuring doth more immediately strike at Gods Government of the World; that peevish and froward men, as Israel in the example, will not allow God to do as he pleaseth, no not to do them good: for if all will take upon them to be Governours, they must always be exercised in a state of War and Confusion. St. <hi>Peter</hi> speaks of wicked men,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.9.</note> who made pretenses to Godliness, that they were <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>could not see a far off, forgot they were purged from their old sins by Baptism</hi>; which also did engage them to <hi>give all diligence to make their calling and election sure</hi>; and that by <hi>addding to their Faith Virtue,</hi> &amp;c. an holy Life, to an holy Profession.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Israel</hi> was brought out of Bondage from <hi>Egypt</hi> by mighty signs and miracles; they had forgot that; and that God had engaged himself by solemn promises to bring them to <hi>a Land flowing with Milk and Honey</hi>; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were in the Wilderness, and in a marching condition, which sometimes, as all marches, have their straights, they presently forgot what God had done for them, and what more he had promised. Such were those ill Christians in Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> who were weary of their profession, because it did enjoyn too strict a Life,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101676:10"/>
or was attended with some pressures and affliction: and such are all ill Subjects, who forget the benefits they receive from the Government under which they live, and will be always making attempts to mend it, though they do not foresee the mischiefs that their own designs would ensnare them into.</p>
            <p>Froward men disturb Gods method of mercy, and make it miscarry in the Womb. He intended quietly and safely to lead <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Egypt</hi> into <hi>Canaan</hi>; and the march of so many years might have been accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished in so many days: but they stood in their own light, and stopped the way against themselves. They tempted God very oft, and so oft, that a patient and longsuffering God at last <hi>Sware in his wrath that they should not enter into his rest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The murmuring discontents of Israel were not recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by <hi>Moses</hi> onely for their sakes; St. <hi>Paul</hi> apply's it in the Text to the froward <hi>Corinthians:</hi> and it ought to be a warning to all Male-contents, especially to those, who are always complaining of their Governours.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This Sin of murmuring is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, an ill habit of the stomach, that corrupts the best meat; we murmur at mercys, as Israel did at Manna. Certainly to all wise and unprejudiced men, the Restauration of the King, and so of the Church, <hi>Anno</hi> 1660. was a mighty mercy, and I may say, almost, or altogether equal with any that Israel had: for it secured to us all our Libertys as Subjects, which before were but precarious; for the Governments we lived under were Arbitrary, and themselves were uncertain, still upon the wheel of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as Factions could supplant each other: and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stauration of the Church, that is, of our National as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished by Law, hath best secured to us the Protestant Religion. I speak to them, who are the lovers of it: for though the Factions, that have been rampant, were
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101676:10"/>
very zealous against Popery, yet they might in time have been betrayed into it; for the Basis on which those usurped, and still changeable Governments were founded, was <hi>Liberty of Conscience</hi>; and so soon as they could see themselves secure against the claims of the Royal Family, Popery also might have had it's share in the <hi>Toleration:</hi> for it was the interest of the Usurpers to do it; and in doing of it, to strengthen themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Common enemy,</hi> the King and his Party, as they were then called. For they are much mistaken, who think that the Pope loves Kings, more than De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magogues, the Directors of popular Governments. For this, let an enquiry be made, what Monarchys have been abased by the Papal power: And if Popery could have once come to have as free toleration, as the then Factions had, in some few years it would have swallowed them up, as <hi>Moses</hi>'s Rod did the Magicians. For men at last, when their civil Rights were secured, would be weary of so many new invented forms of Religion; and would be now, but that they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually hurried on by underhand contrivances.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This Sin of murmuring is a most comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive and diffusive malady; few of us, that are not guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it. There are some sins, that great Sinners are not guilty of; and though this be a sin that is ranked by the Apostle with Fornication and Idolatry, and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly a sin too, that we are apt to condemn in others, yet we will not discern it as such in our selves: we say in their Language in the Psalmist, <hi>Our tongues are our own, who is Lord over us?</hi> we are apt to think that we can speak without offence. Who puts into the Diary of his Confession, his reviling of Government, his speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evil of Dignitys, his repining at every accident or event of Divine Providence? These things pass <hi>incogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> we rarely reflect upon the guilt. Are the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101676:11"/>
we give our selves and our friends, but things with us of no peccancy, or sins that seldom descend so far as to the Conscience, though whole Familys, Villages, and Corporations are poysoned with it?</p>
            <p>Some Casuists tell us, that Habitual sins have a guilt distinct from those sins of which they are habits; and that they are more dangerous, because the Sinner is the farther off from Repentance. The guilt that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted from those habits doth make a <hi>Callus,</hi> and fear the Conscience, that the Sinner little thinks on it, that he is <hi>going down to the Chambers of death,</hi> and he is ensnared into <hi>Damnation, drowned in Perdition,</hi> before he says, <hi>Domine miserere,</hi> or <hi>asks, What he hath done.</hi> The habit of murmuring is so universal, hand joyned to hand, tongue to tongue, that the sense of the guilt is lost; and because 'tis so, 'tis a distinct guilt: for the greatest Sinners have repented, as suppose Murderers, Adulter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, yea and Idolaters too, who are in a peculiar manner guilty <hi>laesae Majestatis divinae,</hi> and Traytors to the God of Heaven.</p>
            <p>The Repentance of all habitual Sinners is difficult, but the repentance of an habitual Murmurer is beset with more than ordinary difficultys: for the arguments that should reach the guilt, are not well reducible to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny single Commandment, and do scarce affect the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of any: Though murmuring is a sin of a complica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted guilt, affects both Tables, and most of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of both.</p>
            <p>Besides, the Murmurer is not so soon as other Sinners convinced of his guilt, because he hath framed a rule of rectitude to himself; and his conscience opens and shuts by that rule, and so he <hi>strains at Gnats, and swallows Camels.</hi> Nothing so much troubled the Conscience of a <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Shepherd, when he came to Confession at <hi>Easter,</hi> as that he had tasted a little Cream the <hi>Lent</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101676:11"/>
But he had often Robbed and Murthered Passen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers on the Mountains; and that troubled not his Conscience, because his Father and Grandfather had done so before.</p>
            <p>I believe we are all of us very ready to pass a true and just censure here: but reflect. There are, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not digest a Set-form of Prayers in our Assemblies, are offended at a Surplice, startle at the Cross in Baptism, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet can whisper against their King, and whisp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to be heard too; talk loudly against Bishops and Priests, censure all men; complain of every thing, and be satisfied with nothing.</p>
            <p>Remember that God passed by some of the discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of <hi>Israel</hi>; but when they grew clamorous, and more combined, his wrath fell in among them. And Remember, that God hath other eyes to see sin with than we have; and hath other Scales to weigh them in. But, we our selves do not take kindly ill Language from our Neighbour; and can we think that God will from us, when by our discontents we daily revile his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence? The method of which is to us, as once to <hi>Israel,</hi> to <hi>try us, to do us good at the latter end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IIII. Part of the Text: <hi>Neither murmur ye.</hi> The like judgment threatned to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> as once executed on <hi>Israel. Theod.</hi> saith thus; that they were the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murers among the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>

               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:101676:12"/>All Societies whatsoever, must yeild obedience to the Government they are under; for 'tis their safetie to do it: for we must not think to be all Kings, and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates; for if all are to be Governours, there must be none to be governed. The case is the same in all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Assemblies, be they greater or lesser.

For this, Kings set uneasy in their Thrones, and Bishops and Priests are meanly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed, and the people are Tumultuous, and Religion is disgraced; and all this, because ambitious men cannot have their aims: They struggle with the Divine dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, which hath alotted to all men their proper places. Let the Governours and Governed look to their dutie. So I leave this, and propound next the sense of <hi>Theoph.</hi> upon the Text: who says that the Apostle chides them, who did not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>generously bear up</hi> against the reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and persecutors of their Religion: and this seems to be congruous to the argument of consolation; <hi>There hath no temptation taken you, but such as is common to men; but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it</hi>; and therefore falls upon those Murmurers, who say, When shall we have any good days? and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; how long shall we lie under these pressures?</p>
            <p>The <hi>Carnal</hi> among them, as there were many no doubt, did oft reflect upon their quiet state when they were Heathens, as the <hi>Israelites</hi> did, when they were in <hi>Egypt:</hi> but the conditions of both became trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some; of the one, by changing their Religion; of the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:101676:12"/>
other, by changing their Country; though both were for the better: but both did repine and murmur, because of their present distresses; they did not or would not see a Divine Intendment of love in them.</p>
            <p>Truly God hath exercised us with a various face of afflictions in one Age; but such have been in our, and in other Nations before: but on whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, or whensoever he sends them, they are as so many Summons to Repentance: and if we make that use of them, he hath gained his end in send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them; for <hi>he doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the Children of men:</hi> but if we repine, and are impatient under correction, there is for us a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> as St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> told his Auditors, God may deal with us <hi>more severely,</hi> than with <hi>Israel</hi>; for we live in a fuller light, and a greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, <hi>on whom the ends of the World are fallen.</hi> The aim of <hi>Israel</hi> was an Earthly <hi>Canaan</hi>; our's is a Heavenly: but we must pass through a Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness to the one, as they did to the other: but if God hear of our murmurings in it, take care, that he doth not <hi>Swear in his wrath</hi> to us, as once to them, <hi>If they shall,</hi> that is, <hi>we shall not enter into his rest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The punishments that God afflicts on us, we must patiently abide; which if we do, 'tis to us a Signature of our adoption, that we are <hi>Sons</hi> and not <hi>Bastards,</hi> who will own him to be <hi>our Father which is in Heaven</hi>; and so pray to him when he <hi>Corrects</hi> us with his <hi>Rod,</hi> as well as when he <hi>Comforts</hi> us with his <hi>Staff.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But we have no reason to complain at any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Calamities at this time, but we have much
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:101676:13"/>
to thank God for the peace and plentie we do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy. There are scarce any parts of Christendom so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molested as we are; of whom some are now <hi>contending unto bloud</hi> for their Lives, Liberties and Religion, against the <hi>Mahometans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Brethren, I will close with that of the Apostle, <hi>Do all things without murmurings and disputings</hi>;<note place="margin">Phil. 2.14.</note> yea, <hi>and suffer all things,</hi> which God hath not put in our power by regular means to redress: However, make no <hi>complaining in our Streets,</hi> until there be actual <hi>leading into Captivity</hi>; for that is to exceed the example of <hi>Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fears and Jealousies in our Nation, hath even an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipated our miseries; and we brought real mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs upon our selves, by hastning to prevent the phansied. In a word, the murmuring of <hi>Israel</hi> was against <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> that is, the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Priest</hi>; which God took as done against him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
            <p>Be wise before it be too late, lest we fall into the hands of the <hi>Destroyer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the <hi>Declaration</hi> saith thus: <hi>In case it had plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God to permit these wicked designes to have taken effect, there could have been nothing in prospect but confusion. For instead of a Reformation they preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, their Success would have produced Divisions and Wars among themselves, until the predominant party could have enslaved the whole Kingdom.</hi> So far the Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>Such intestine broyls might have brought in an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion</hi> indeed.</p>
            <p>There were, some years since, Libellous Pamphlets,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:101676:13"/>
under the Allegory of a <hi>Ship</hi> and its <hi>Officers,</hi> in which the <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Duke,</hi> &amp;c. were covertly tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. Allow me to speak under the like. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose a Ship out at Sea many Leagues from Land, in which a Conspiracy was made by some Male-contended Saylors and under - Officers against the Captain and others; but the Captain had so many true to him, that with them and his Authority, he still so kept them in awe, that they durst not attempt an open Mutiny: Wherefore these Male-contents secretly joyn in a Conspiracy to sink the Ship, and for their escape, to hoyse out the Long-Boat under some colour, as the Mariners did, <hi>Acts</hi> 27. Suppose now the Ship with the Captain and his friends were sinking, and the Conspirators had cleared their Boat of the Ship, and were safe in it, rejoycing to see that their Plot and Revenge had taken effect. The next thing they contrive for themselves, is to agree what Land to make: some are for directing their Course East, some West, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In this difference, they could not agree what Land to make; but the case was such, that the determination must be speedy: but neither yeilding to each others conceit what Shore was nearest or best, from words they fall to Blows. So here I leave them, and the Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory to be applyed by every common capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>Wherefore let us bless God for the Deliverance we this day are required to celebrate, and let us beseech him still to protect our Soveraign Lord the King, and His; and his Government as now it is in Church and State; to convert those, who
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:101676:14"/>
have taken up any prejudices against either, and to disappoint all the machinations, open or secret, of the Enemies of our peace, which God continue among us.</p>
