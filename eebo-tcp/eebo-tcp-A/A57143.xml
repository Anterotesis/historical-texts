         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE HONOURABLE House of COMMONS assembled in PARLIAMENT.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N obedience to your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, I here humble pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to your view what you were pleased with patience and readiness of affection lately to attend unto. I considered, that though the Choiceness of the Auditory might require the exactest preparation; yet both the condition of the <hi>Times,</hi> and the nature of the <hi>Duty</hi> did call upon us to <hi>lay aside our Ornaments.</hi> And therefore I speake with such plainness, as might commend the matter delivered ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the <hi>Conscience</hi> of a Penitent, then to the <hi>fancy</hi> of a delicate hearer. The King of <hi>Nineveh</hi> was a King as well in his Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth,
<pb facs="tcp:102469:4"/>
as in his Robes: And the truth of God is indeed fuller of Majesty when it is naked, then when adorned with the dresse of any humane contribution, which many times takes from it, but never addes any value unto it.</p>
            <p>I looked upon you in your double Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, both <hi>Common</hi> as Christians, and <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall,</hi> as men intrusted with the managing of those arduous and most pressing difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties under which this distempered Kingdom is now groaning.</p>
            <p>And for the quickning of those endevours which belong to you in both those Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I presented you both with the <hi>bottome</hi> of a Nations <hi>unhappiness,</hi> which is <hi>sin</hi>; and with the <hi>top</hi> of their <hi>felicity,</hi> which is Gods <hi>free grace and favour:</hi> That by your serious cares to purge out the one, and to procure the other, you might, by Gods blessing on your Consultations, dispell that black tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest which hangs over this Kingdom, and reduce the face of things unto calmness and serenity again.</p>
            <p>When the Children strugled together in the womb of <hi>Rebekah,</hi> she was thereupon
<pb facs="tcp:102469:4"/>
inquisitive, <hi>If it be, Why am I thus?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen: 35, 22.</note> and she addressed her self to God for a resolution. Surely this Nation is become like the <hi>womb of Rebekah,</hi> the children thereof strugling in their mothers belly together, and when God hath mercifully freed us from forain Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, <hi>Brethren are become enemies to brethren,</hi> and by their enmities likely to tear and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the bowels of their mother, and to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine themselves.</p>
            <p>And what have we now to do, but to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the <hi>Cause</hi> of these sad co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>motions, <hi>Why are we thus?</hi> And surely the <hi>Cause</hi> is chiefly where the <hi>Disease</hi> is, within <hi>our selves.</hi> We have been like the womb of <hi>Rebekah,</hi> a <hi>barren Nation,</hi> not bringing forth fruits of so many mercies as God hath filled us withall. So that now it is no wonder, if God cause us to be in pain within our own Bowels, and to feel the throwes and struglings of a <hi>Travelling woman,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hos. 13.13.</note> ready to bring forth her own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, a <hi>Benoni,</hi> or an <hi>Ichabod,</hi> a son of <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,</hi> and of <hi>Shame,</hi> to this hitherto so peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and flourishing a Kingdom.</p>
            <p>All that we can comfort our selves with in these pangs and qualms of distemper is, that
<pb facs="tcp:102469:5"/>
there are some <hi>Iacobs</hi> amongst us.<note place="margin">Gen. 32.24. Hos. 12.3, 4.</note> who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steed of supplanting their brethren, will <hi>wrestle, and have power with God.</hi> The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have often <hi>Petitioned,</hi> sometimes his <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Majesty,</hi> sometimes this <hi>Honourable House,</hi> which are his great <hi>Councel,</hi> many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertures, &amp; endeavor of <hi>Accommodation</hi> have been tendred,<note place="margin">Isa. 26.17, 18.</note> &amp; yet we <hi>cry out in our pangs,</hi> &amp; <hi>have, as it were, brought forth wind, neither have we wrought any deliverance in the earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have here therefore presented a <hi>new Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition,</hi> dictated &amp; drawn up to our hands by Gods own Spirit, unto which both <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament, Peers</hi> and <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> must al subscribe, and offer it with prostrate &amp; penitent hearts unto him <hi>who stands in the congregation of the mighty,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 82.1.</note> 
               <hi>&amp; judgeth amongst the gods,</hi> that he would <hi>take away all our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi> and <hi>receive us into favour</hi> again, and accept of a <hi>Covenant</hi> of new obedience.</p>
            <p>And this <hi>Petition</hi> God is pleased to anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate with an answer of grace in the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent parts of the chapter whence the Text is taken, and that particularly to every branch of the Petition. <hi>He will take away ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi> His <hi>Anger</hi> shall not punish, His <hi>Love</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:102469:5"/>
shal heal our backslidings, the greatness of our sins shall not hinder the freeness of his Grace. He will do us good, and give us life, by the dew of his grace reviving us: and Glory clothing us like the Lilly of the field, with the beauty of holiness: and stability, fixing us by his grace, as the Cedars of Lebanon are fastned upon their Roots: and growth or enlargement as the branches spread forth themselves, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual vigor &amp; plenty, as the Olive tree, which is always green and fruitful, and glorious comforts by the sweet savor of the knowledg of God,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 2.14.</note> which like the spice trees of Lebanon shall diffuse a spiritual perfume upon the names, and into the consciences of penitent converts.</p>
            <p>He will prevent us with the blessings of Safety, as well as of Sanctity and Comfort, we shall under his shadow finde shelter and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection from all our fears. Though like Corn, we be harrowed under the Clods, though like a lopped vine we seem naked, and reduced to lowness, though like crushed grapes we lie under heavy pressures: yet he will receive, and enlarge, and comfort us again, and when we are in our own eyes as fatherless children, He
<pb facs="tcp:102469:6"/>
will set his eyes upon us as a Tutor and Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, He will hear and observe, and answer, and pity us, enabling us to make good our Covenant by his grace, and causing the fruits of his loving kindness to be found upon us. Thus God is pleased to borrow the various perfection of other things to adumbrate the united and calumniated mercies which he promiseth unto a converting and petitioning people.</p>
            <p>You have the Petition sent you from God, and his Answer preventing you in all the members of it with the blessings of goodness. I have nothing else to do, but to beg of you, and of all this great people whom you repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, the Subscription of your hearts and lives unto this Petition: and to beg of God that he would graciously incline the hearts of this whole Kingdom, rather to wrastle with him for a blessing, then to struggle and conflict a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselves for a Curse. With which prayer I humbly conclude. Commending your persons and your weighty affairs to his grace; and rest,</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian Reader, Understanding that my Sermon, which was preached three years since before the Honorable House of Commons, on the day of their solemn <hi>Humiliation,</hi> was to be reprinted: I thought fit to peruse, transcribe, and enlarge six other Sermons, in which I had, at mine own charge in the Country, on the ensuing Fast days, briefly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained and applyed that whole Chapter, (a portion only where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was in the first handled,) and to send them forth together with it unto the publique: Which I was the rather induced to do for these two Reasons: 1. Because it hath pleased God in his righteous and holy providence to make me, by a long infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, unserviceable to his Church in the principal work of the Ministry, the preaching of the Gospel (which is no small grief unto me.) So that there remained no other means whereby my life might, in regard of my function, be useful to the Church, and comfortable to my self, then by inverting the words of the Psalmist,<note place="margin">Psalm 45.1.</note> and as he made <hi>His Tongue as the Pen of a ready Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> so to make my Pen the Tongue of an unready Speaker. 2. I considered the seasonableness and sutableness of these Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions unto the condition of the sad and disconsolate times where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we live, very like those which our Prophet threatned the ten Tribes withal throughout this whole Prophecy, unto which this last Chapter is a kind of <hi>Vse,</hi> and a <hi>most solemn Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> pressing upon all wise and prudent men such duties of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> as might turn threats into promises, and recover again the mercies which by their sins they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited and forsaken: Which being restored unto them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Petition, they are here likewise further instructed in what manner to return unto God the <hi>praises</hi> due to his great
<pb facs="tcp:102469:7"/>
Name. And these two duties of <hi>Humiliation</hi> and <hi>Thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> are the most solemn duties which in these times of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Mercies so variously interwoven together, the Lord doth so frequently call us unto.</p>
            <p>Places of Scripture I have for brevity sake, for the most part, only quoted and referred thee unto, without transcribing all the words, and have usually put many paralel places together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because by that means they do not only strengthen the doctrine whereunto they belong, but mutually give light unto one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
            <p>The Lord make us all in this our day so <hi>wise and prudent,</hi> as to understand the <hi>righteous ways</hi> of our God towards us: That we may not <hi>stumble</hi> at them,<note place="margin">Isai. 26.8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>9.</note> but <hi>walk</hi> in them, and be taught by them <hi>to wait upon him in the way of his judgments,</hi> and to fix the <hi>desires of our soul</hi> upon his <hi>Name</hi> as our great <hi>Refuge,</hi> and upon his <hi>Righteousness</hi> as our great <hi>Business,</hi> till he shall be pleased, by the <hi>dew</hi> of his Grace, to <hi>Revive us as the Corn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to make us grow as the Vine,</hi> and to let the scent of all his Ordinances be over all our Land, as the <hi>smell,</hi> and as the <hi>wine of Lebanon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It will be an abundant return unto my poor and weak endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors, if I may have that room in thy prayers which the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> desired to have in the prayers of the Ephesians,<note place="margin">Ephes. 6.19.</note>

                     <hi>Sect. 1. EPhraims</hi> blessings and judgments answerable to his name. <hi>2.</hi> When judgment purposed against obstinate sinners, mercy proclaimed to peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. <hi>3.</hi> How good and bad are alike involved in outward judgments. Iudgments make no difference but of penitent and impenitent. Penitent sinners, in all kinds of trouble, have a refuge to some promise or other. <hi>4.</hi> Conversion must be not meerly Philosophical, or Political, but Spiritual, and that full and constant. <hi>5.</hi> Motives unto conversion, mercy and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, especially interwoven. <hi>6.</hi> Great preparation due in our addresses unto God. The rule, matter, principle, and power of Prayer. How sin is taken away. <hi>7.</hi> When God threatneth judgments, we must pray against sins. <hi>8.</hi> Iudgments may be removed in anger. Repentance makes afflictions precious, as sin doth corrupt blessings. <hi>9.</hi> No affliction comes in anger, but with respect to sin. <hi>10.</hi> One sin generally unrepented of, may undo a Kingdom; we must pray against all, and dye unto all. <hi>11.</hi> Sense of sin. The wrath of God beyond the fears of man. <hi>12.</hi> Confession of sin full and free. Our weakness can commit sin, none but Gods power can remove it. <hi>13.</hi> What God worketh in us, he also requireth of us. Sin most dangerous in great men, to themselves and the publick. <hi>14.</hi> How iniquity is to be taken out of the Land. <hi>15.</hi> God the author of good, the orderer of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. <hi>16.</hi> From conversion to salvation free-grace worketh. <hi>17.</hi> No work truly good, but as derived from God. <hi>18.</hi> Patience in suffering evil, in doing duty. Humility the companion of Grace, pride of emptiness. Continual dependance on God. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity in services. The misery of divisions. <hi>19.</hi> In temporal judgments pray for spiritual mercies. No helps can avail us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb facs="tcp:102469:8"/>
Gods anger, but his grace. <hi>20.</hi> Carnal prayers provoke God, when men make Religion serve turns. Piety the foundation of Prosperity. <hi>21.</hi> Iudgments are then truly sanctified, when they make us more in love with grace. Prayer the more heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the more prevalent.</p>

Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles converted are called Iews: Iews unconverted, Gentiles. Baptism how the answer of a good conscience. The Covenant perpetual. <hi>4.</hi> God bindeth himself to us by promise, by oath: We are his by his Soveraign Interest, and our own voluntary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. <hi>5.</hi> Fickleness of the heart in duty, and sluggishness to it. <hi>6.</hi> Duties in combination strongest. <hi>7.</hi> Enemies combine.

                     <hi>Sect. 1.</hi> REpentance removes carnal confidence. Naturally we affect an absoluteness within our selves. <hi>2.</hi> This failing, we trust in other creatures. <hi>3.</hi> When all fail, we go to God in ways of our own inventing. Repentance the cure of all this. <hi>4.</hi> Confederacies with Gods enemies dangerous.

not to be trusted in, they are lyes. Grounds of confidence, all wanting in Idols. <hi>7.</hi> God onely to be trusted absolutely in the way of his commands and providence. <hi>8.</hi> The way to mercy is to be fatherless: weakness in our selves makes us seek help above our selves. <hi>9.</hi> Sin healed by pardon, purging, deliverance, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.

Gods anger will consist with his love. <hi>11.</hi> Conversion and heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing go together. Sin a sickness and a wound. <hi>12.</hi> The proper passions of sickness agree to sin, <hi>viz.</hi> pain, weakness, consumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, deformity. <hi>13.</hi> Sin a wound: the impotent, wilful, and desperate case of this patient. <hi>14.</hi> The mercy of the Physitian. <hi>15.</hi> Guilt cannot look on Majesty. Apprehensions of mercy the grounds of prayer. <hi>16.</hi> Sense of misery works estimation of mercy. <hi>17.</hi> Back-sliding formally opposite to faith and repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Apostacy two-fold. What it is to speak against the Son of man, and against the Spirit. How a sin is said not to be forgiven in this world, nor in the world to come. Free love respects not persons, nor free pardon, sins. <hi>18.</hi> From beginning to end of salvation, all is free grace. <hi>19.</hi> In judgments Gods anger more to be noted then our sufferings.</p>

of the <hi>womb,</hi> abundance of <hi>people.</hi> But our misery is, that the abundance of our sins hath mightily outvied the abundance both of our plenty and of our people: sins too too paralel to those of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim,</hi> if you will but read this Prophet, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the behaviours of this Nation with him.

                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 2.</note> That in the midst of <hi>Iudgments</hi> proposed against sinners that are <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate,</hi> God doth reserve and proclaim <hi>Mercy</hi> unto sinners that are <hi>penitent.</hi> When a <hi>Consumption</hi> is decreed, yet a <hi>Remnant</hi> i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>reserved</hi> to return, <hi>Isa.</hi> 10.22, 23. The Lord will keep his <hi>Vineyard,</hi> when he will burn up the <hi>thorns</hi> and the bryars together.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102469:13"/>

When the Lord is coming out of his place to punish the Inhabitants of the Earth for their iniquity, he calls upon his people to <hi>hide</hi> themselves in their <hi>chambers,</hi> until the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation be overpast, <hi>Isai.</hi> 26.20, 21. The Angel which was sent to destroy <hi>Sodom,</hi> had withall a Commission to deliver <hi>Lot, Genes.</hi> 19.15. God made full provision for those who mourned for publick abominations before he gave order to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the rest, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9.4, 6. Men in their wrath will many times rather strike a friend then spare a foe: But Gods proceedings are without disorder, he will rather spare his foes then strike his servants, as he shewed himself willing to have done in the case of <hi>Sodom, Gen.</hi> 18.26. <hi>Moses stood in the gap,</hi> and diverted Judgments from <hi>Israel, Psa.</hi> 106.23. Yea God seeks for such, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.30. and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains when they cannot be found, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13, 5. And if he deliver others for them, certainly he will not destroy them for others. How ever it go with the world and with wicked men, it <hi>shall go well with the righteous,</hi> there shall be a <hi>Sanctuary</hi> for them when others <hi>stumble,</hi> and they shall pass through the fire, when others are consumed by it, <hi>Isa.</hi> 3.10, 11. <hi>Isai.</hi> 8.14, 15, 16. <hi>Zech.</hi> 13.8, 9.</p>
            <p>Reasons hereof are, <hi>Gods Iustice,</hi> he will not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the righteous with the wicked; he will have it appear that there is <hi>a difference between him that serveth God, and him that serveth him not, Gen.</hi> 18.23 <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Gods love</hi> unto his people.

Here is a climax &amp; gradation of arguments drawn from Love. In a great fire, and devouring trouble (such as is threatened there, Chap. 4.1.) <hi>property</hi> alone is a ground of <hi>care,</hi> a man would willingly save and secure that which is his own, and of any use unto him; but if you add unto this <hi>preciousness,</hi> that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth the care. A man will make hard shift to deliver a rich Cabinet of Jewels, though all his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary goods and utensils should perish. But of all Jewels, those which come out of the body are much more precious then those which onely adorn it. Who would not snatch rather his <hi>childe</hi> then his <hi>casket</hi> or <hi>purse</hi> out of a flame? <hi>Relation</hi> works not onely upon the affection, but upon the <hi>bowels, Ier.</hi> 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.20. And lastly, the same excellency that the word <hi>jewel</hi> doth add unto the word <hi>mine</hi>; the same excellency doth <hi>service</hi> add unto the word <hi>sonne.</hi> A man hath much conflict in himself to take off his heart from an undutiful sonne. Never a worse son then <hi>Absalom,</hi> and yet how doth <hi>David</hi> give a charge to the Commanders to have him spared? How inquisitive after his safety? How passionately and unseasonably mournful upon the news of his death? But if any child be more a jewel then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, certainly it is a <hi>dutiful childe,</hi> who hath not onely an interest in our love by <hi>Nature,</hi> but by <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</hi> All these grounds of care and protection
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102469:14"/>
for Gods people in trouble are here expressed, <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,</hi> they are <hi>mine; preciousness,</hi> they are <hi>jewels,</hi> trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, ornaments unto me. <hi>Relation,</hi> they are <hi>sons; usefulness,</hi> they are sons that <hi>serve,</hi> none could look on a thing so many ways lovely with the same eye as upon a professed and provoking Enemy.</p>
            <p>Lastly, <hi>Gods name and glory.</hi> He hath spared his people even in the midst of their <hi>provocations</hi> for his Names sake, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.26, 27. <hi>Iosh.</hi> 7.9. How much more when they <hi>repent</hi> and seek his face? He will never let it be said, that any <hi>seek the Lord in vain,</hi> Isa. 45.19.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 3.</note>But it may be objected, Doth not <hi>Solomon</hi> say, that <hi>all things happen alike unto all?</hi> and that <hi>no man can know love or hatred by that which is before him?</hi> Eccles. 9.1, 2. And is it not certain and common, that in publick desolations good as well as bad do perish? Doth not the Sword devour as well one as another?</p>
            <p>It is true, God doth not always difference his servants from wicked men by temporal deliveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: Troubles commonly and promiscuously in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve all sorts. But there are these two things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable in it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That many times the good suffer with the bad, because they are together corrupted with them, and when they joyn in the common <hi>provocations,</hi> no wonder if they suffer in the <hi>common judgments,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel. 18.4. Nay the sins of Gods people do (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in this case) more provoke him unto out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward judgments, then the sins of his professed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Because they expose his <hi>name</hi> to the more
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102469:14"/>
contempt, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.14. and are committed against the greater <hi>love, Amos</hi> 3.2. and he hath <hi>future judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> for the wicked, and therefore usually <hi>beginneth</hi> here at his own <hi>sanctuary,</hi> Ezek. 9.6. 1 Pet. 4.17.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When good men, who have preserved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from publick sins, do yet fall by publick judgments, yet there is a <hi>great difference</hi> in this seeming <hi>equality,</hi> the same affliction having like the Pillar that went before <hi>Israel,</hi> a <hi>light side</hi> towards Gods people, and a <hi>dark side</hi> toward the Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, God usually recompencing the outward evils of his people with more plentiful evidences of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and spiritual joy. A good man may be in great darkness as well as a wicked man, but in that case he hath the name of God to stay himself upon, which no wicked man in the world hath, <hi>Isa.</hi> 50, 10. The <hi>metal</hi> and the <hi>dross</hi> go both into the fire toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but the drosse is consumed, the metal refined. So is it with godly and wicked in their sufferings. <hi>Zach.</hi> 13, 9, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 8.12, 13.</p>
            <p>This reproveth the folly of those who in time of trouble rely upon vain things which cannot help them, and continue their sins still. For Iudgments make no difference of any but <hi>penitent and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,</hi> Sickness doth not complement with an hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable person, but useth him as coursely as the base. Death knocks as well at a Princes palace as a poor mans cottage: wise men dye as well as fools. Yea poyson usually works more violently when tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered with wine, then with some duller and baser material. In times of trouble usually the greater the persons the closer the judgments. When <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:102469:15"/>
was taken the Nobles were slain, but the poor of the Land had vineyards and fields given them, <hi>Ier.</hi> 39.6, 10.</p>
            <p>Therefore in troubles we should be more hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for our sins then our sufferings, because sin is the sting of suffering. That mercies should not win us, that judgment should not awaken us: that the <hi>rod</hi> should <hi>speak,</hi> and we <hi>not hear,</hi> Mic. 6.9. That the <hi>fire</hi> should <hi>burn,</hi> and we not <hi>feel,</hi> Isa. 42.25. That desolation should be threatned, and we not <hi>instructed,</hi> Jer. 6.8. That the hand of God should be <hi>lifted up,</hi> and we not <hi>see it,</hi> Isa. 26.11. That <hi>dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> should be upon us, &amp; we not give <hi>glory</hi> to God, Jer. 13.6. This is that should most deject us, that in mercies we have been <hi>wanton,</hi> and in judgments <hi>sensless.</hi> Get Repentance by an affliction, and then you may look on it as <hi>trafick,</hi> and not as a <hi>trouble,</hi> like a Merchants voyage, which hath pain in the way, but treasure in the end. No afflictions can hurt him that is penitent. If thou escape, they will make thee the more thankful; if not, they will bring thee the neerer and the sooner unto God.</p>
            <p>The way to be safe in times of trouble, is to get the blood of the Lamb upon our doors. All troubles have their Commission and Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from God, what to do, whither to go, whom to touch; whom to pass over. Be gold, and though the fire come upon you, you shal keep your nature and purity still. Godliness, saith the Apostle, hath the promises of this life; &amp; amongst those one spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial one is, that we shall not be tempted above what we are able, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. neither are there

indeed any distresses against which there is not a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge and escape for penitent sinners unto some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise or other. Against <hi>Captivity.</hi> When they be in the land of their Enemies <hi>I will not cast them away, nor abhorre them.</hi> Levit. 26.44. Against <hi>famine and pestilence. If I shut up heaven</hi> that there be no rain, <hi>or if I command the locust</hi> to devoure the Land, or <hi>if I send pestilence</hi> among my people: If my people which are called by my Name shall humble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked wayes: then <hi>will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and wil heal their Land.</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7.13.14.

then indeed of late they are. It is true, here, and in other Cities, and populous places, there is haply lesse cause to complain. But who can without sorrow and shame behold in our Countrey towns, men so unapprehensive either of their brethrens suf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ferings, or of their own sins and dangers, as to give God quite over, to let him rest, that they themselvs may work; to come in truth to <hi>Iehorams</hi> resolution, Why should we wait upon God any longer? to grudge their brethrens and their own souls and safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties one day in thirty, and to tell all the world that indeed their daies work is of more value with them then their dayes worship, multitudes drudging and moyling in the earth, while their brethren are mourning and besieging of heaven.

               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:102469:19"/>The word signifies, 1. To expiate, and make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement by a sacrifice. So the scape Goate (which was a signe of Christ our Sacrifice as ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen and living againe) is said to carry the sinnes of the People into the wildernesse, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16.22. Thereby signifying Christs taking our sinnes from us, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.29. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9.28. 2. To forgive, which in the Court of mercy is the taking of sinne away, <hi>Psal.</hi> 32.1.5. 3. To remove or take away by destroying. So it is used, <hi>Hosea.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Iob</hi> 32.22. and is sometimes used to expresse Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.21. <hi>Nahum</hi> 1.5. so sinne is said to be destroyed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.6. to be subdued, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.19. to be purged away with the spirit of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and burning, <hi>Isa.</hi> 4.4. The meaning then is, Take away all our sinnes from us, lay them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Christ our Sacrifice, for his Merit pardon them, by his Grace destroy and subdue them, that so the root of Judgements being removed, they likewise may therewithall be removed too. From hence the Observation which I shall insist upon is this:</p>

            <p n="3">III. Sin being removed, though the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on should not be removed, yet it is <hi>sanctified</hi> and turned into good. Repentance like the <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers stone,</hi> can turn Iron into Gold, can make <hi>Golden afflictions.</hi> So the triall of our faith, that is, our affliction, is said to be <hi>more precious then Gold,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.7. Whereas sinne remaining is like <hi>Copres</hi> which will turne wine or milk into inke. It converts the blessings of God into the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of lusts. Cankers learning with pride, and wit with prophanenesse, and wealth with luxury; like Leaven which turnes a very Passeover into pollutions. As the <note n="b" place="margin">

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:102469:21"/>
can make leather an ornament, when the <hi>Sanies</hi> of a plague-sore will render a robe infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious. As it was said of <hi>Naaman,</hi> He was a great man, an honourable man, a mighty man of war; <note n="a" place="margin">2 King 5.1.</note> 
               <hi>But he was a Leaper</hi>: so what ever other orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments a man hath, sinne staines them with the fou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest <hi>But,</hi> that can be brought to deprave the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest endowments. A learned man, a wealthy man, a wise man, an honourable man, <hi>But a wicked man.</hi> This makes all those other good things tributa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unto Satan.</p>
            <p>And therefore as the <note n="b" place="margin">Num. 31.22.</note> gold and silver of the <hi>Canaanites</hi> was to passe through the fire before it could be used by <hi>Israel</hi>: so all other blessings bestowed on men must passe through the <hi>spirit of Iudgement and burning,</hi> through the purifying waters of Repentance, before they can bring ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the Author, or comfort to the enjoyer of them.

            <p>And as sinne doth thus corrupt blessings, so on the other side Repentance doth sweeten Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and can turne afflictions into matter of comfort. As skarlet puls out the teeth of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:102469:22"/>
so this takes away the sting of a Judgement. As wine draweth a nourishing vertue from the flesh of Vipers: as hot birds can feed upon Iron, and purge their bodies with swallowing of stones; so <hi>repentance,</hi> though it should not remove a Judgement, yet it can feed upon it, and fetch meat out of the Eater, and out of the strong sweetnesse.</p>
            <p>There are two Evils in Afflictions. Their <hi>thorne in the flesh,</hi> as they are matter of <hi>paine,</hi> and their <note n="a" place="margin">Isa. 8.21. 2 Chro. 28.22. Rev. 16.10.</note>

Now as a prisoner, though he cannot make his chain lighter then it is, yet by lining it with wooll or other soft things, he can prevent the galling: so Repentance though it take not away the <hi>paine</hi> of Affliction from the <hi>flesh,</hi> yet by meekning and humbling the soule, with silence and quietnesse to <note n="b" place="margin">Mic. 7.9.

               <hi>Plutarch</hi> said of the <hi>Scythians,</hi> that though they had no musick nor Vines amongst them,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:102469:22"/>
yet they had Gods: so what ever other things may be wanting to a people, yet if God be their God, they are not destitute of any happinesse. <note n="a" place="margin">Plut. de Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitate tuend.</note> Yea as those Roses are usually sweetest which grow nearest unto stinking weeds: so the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of Gods Spirit are strongest when a man is otherwise perplexed with the greater difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. It was promised unto <hi>Iosiah,</hi> that he should die in peace, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34.28. and yet we find that he was slaine in warre, <hi>Chap.</hi> 35.24.

            <p>Now for the Use and Application of this point; This serveth, first,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 9.</note> to instruct us how to deprecate Calamities when God shaketh his Rod over us. There <note n="b" place="margin">

Sinne is that against which Gods arrowes are directed; and as the arrow sticks in the Butt unto which the marke is fastned: so the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which are shot at sinne, must needs light upon us unto whom sinne cleaveth. The way then to divert the arrow is to remove the marke. It is true, God doth sometimes bring afflictions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out respect to the provocations of sin, upon his best servants. As if a man should shape out of a masse of gold some excellent vessell, though the gold be never so pure, yet it must passe through the fire and the hammer again. But it is certain too, that no affliction comes in <hi>Anger</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:102469:23"/>
but with respect to sinne. And the <hi>Anger</hi> of God is the bitterest thing in any Calamitie.</p>
            <p>Now for diversion of this, there is no way but to get sinne removed. Take the bark from a tree, and the sap can never find way to the boughs. Sinne is the <hi>Vehiculum</hi> which carries shame and sorrow to the soule. Take away that and a Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath no <hi>Commission.</hi> You may find an <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror</hi> in it, if you be not the same men that you were when it issued forth, for God shootes no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows to hurt the body of his Sonne.

Let a man take what course he can to keep off Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and hide himselfe in the closest protection that humane power or policy can contrive, so long as he keepes his sinne with him, Gods ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows will get through at one <note place="margin">1 King. 22.34.</note> joynt or other.

So long as our lives are as bad as before, how can wee expect that our condition should bee better? in that case mercies themselves become no mercies: as in the case of Repentance, judgements would bee no judgements.

Then the weight of a <hi>Mountain,</hi> Luk. 23.30. O what apprehension had S. <hi>Peters</hi> converts of sin, when they felt the nails wherewith they had cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified Christ, sticking fast in their own hearts, and piercing their spirits with torment and horror? <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37.

            <p>Consider it in its <hi>Nature</hi>: an universall bruise and sicknesse, like those diseases which Physicians say are <hi>Corruptio totius substantiae,</hi> from <hi>head</hi> to <hi>foot,</hi> Isa. 1.5, 6.

            <p>Look into the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and see the curse there described: an <hi>everlasting banishment</hi> from the glory of Gods presence: an <hi>everlasting destruction</hi> by the glory of his power, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1.9.

               <note n="b" place="margin">Psal. 90.11</note>. It is impossible for the most trembling consciences, or the most jealous fears of a guilty heart, to looke beyond the wrath of God, or to conceive more of it then indeed it is. As in peace of conscience, the mercy of God is revealed unto beleevers <hi>from faith to faith:</hi> so in anguish of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science the <hi>wrath of God</hi> is revealed <hi>from fear to fear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A timorous man can fancy vast and terrible <hi>fears,</hi> fire, sword, tempests, wracks, furnaces, scald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lead, boyling pitch, running bell, metall; and being kept alive in all these to feele their torment: But these come farre short of the wrath of God, for first, there are <hi>bounds</hi> set to the hurting power of a <hi>creature,</hi> the fire can burn, but it cannot drown; the Serpent can sting, but he cannot teare in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. 2. The <hi>fears</hi> of the heart are bounded within
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:102469:27"/>
those narrow <hi>apprehensions</hi> which it self can frame of the hurts which may be done. But the wrath of God proceeds from an <hi>Infinite</hi> Justice, and is exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by an omnipotent and <hi>unbounded</hi> power, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prising all the terror of all other Creatures, (as the Sun doth all other light) <hi>eminently</hi> and excessively in it. It burns, and drowns, and tears, and stings, and bruises, and consumes, and can make <hi>nature feel</hi> much more then <hi>reason</hi> is able to <hi>comprehend.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O if we could lay these things seriously to heart (and yet these are but lowe expressions, of that which cannot be expressed, and cometh as short of the truth it self as the picture of the Sun in a table, doth of the greatnesse and brightnesse of it in its own Orbe) should we not finde it necessary to cry out, <hi>Take away all iniquitie</hi>? this sicknesse out of my soul, this sword, this nayle, this poysoned arrow out of my heart, this <hi>Dagger</hi> of <hi>Ehud</hi> out of my belly, this milstone, this mountain from off my back, these stings and terrors, these flames and Furies out of my Conscience? Lord, my wounds stinke, my lips quiver, my knees tremble, my belly rots, I am feeble, and broken, and roar, and languish; thy wrath lyes hard upon me, and thy waves go over my head.</p>
            <p>O if we had but a view of sin as it is in its <hi>native foulnesse,</hi> and did feel but a touch of that <hi>fury</hi> that God is readie to powre out upon it, this would stain all the pride of man, and soure all the pleasures of sin, and make a man as fearfull to meddle with it, as a guilty woman with the <hi>bitter water</hi> which caused the Curse. Most true was that which <hi>Luther</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:102469:28"/>
spake in this point. If a man could perfectly see his own evils, the sight thereof would be a perfect hell unto him: and this God will bring wicked men unto. <hi>Reprove them, and set their sins in order before them.</hi> Psal. 50.21. Make them take a view of their own hearts and lives, fuller of sins then the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of stars, or a furnace of sparks. O <hi>Consider this you that forget me,</hi> saith the Lord: <hi>lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second dutie is <hi>Confession,</hi> for he that cries to have sin taken away,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 12.</note> acknowledgeth that it lyes upon him. A <hi>full Confession</hi> not of many, but of All sins, either <hi>actually</hi> committed, or <hi>habitually</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised in our body of sin. <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Athenaeus. lib.</hi> 1.</note> As he in the Comoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian said, that he had invited two guests to dinner <hi>Philocrates,</hi> and <hi>Philocrates,</hi> a single Man, but a double Eater: So in examination of our selves we shall every one finde sins enough in himself to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominate him a double and a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>eble sinner. A <hi>free Confession,</hi> not as <hi>Pharaohs,</hi> extorted upon the wrack; nor as that of <hi>Iudas,</hi> squeezed out with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish and horror, but ingenuous and penitent, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing from the purpose of a pious heart, that cometh like water out of a <hi>Spring,</hi> with a voluntary free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; not like water out of a <hi>Still,</hi> which is forced with fire.</p>
            <p>The third dutie is <hi>Wearinesse</hi> and <hi>detestation</hi> of all sin, for we call not to have a thing removed till we be <hi>weary</hi> of it. Thus we are taught in the <note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 38.2. Ezek. 16.63. Ezek. 6.9.20 43. 1 Cor. 11.31.

               </gap>, against the whole kinde of that which we hate.</p>
            <p>The fourth dutie is an acknowledgement of our own <hi>Impotencie</hi> to remove sin from our selves.<note place="margin">Eph. 2 1.5. Psal. 40.12. Rom. 5.6, 7.6.24. 2 Cor. 3.5. Ier. 6.10. Rom. 8.7.</note> We have no more power then a slave in chains hath to get out of his bondage till another ransome him; then a dead body in a grave, till Christ raise it. Our Iniquitie <hi>takes hold</hi> on us, and <hi>keeps us down,</hi> that we cannot hearken or be subject to the will of God. If sin were not removed by a greater strength then our own, it would most certainly sink us into Hell.</p>
            <p>The last dutie is an <hi>Imploring</hi> of Gods mercie and grace, that what we cannot do our selves, he would be pleased to do for us. <note n="b" place="margin">

            <p>But there is a <hi>further tie</hi> upon you, with relation unto the successe of that Honourable imployment whereunto you are called. <hi>Ita nati estis,</hi>

            <p>The meaning then is.

            <p>From the former consideration, we observe, That <hi>all the good we have is from God</hi>; he only must be sought unto for it; we have none in <hi>our selves,</hi> I know that in me, that is, <hi>in my flesh dwelleth no good,</hi> Rom. 7.18. we can neither <note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 6.5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2 Cor. 3.5.

But Jerusalem inhabited <hi>after</hi> the Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitie, is just like Jerusalem inhabited <hi>before</hi> the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivitie; so that from hence it appears, that all their weeping and separating was not for pious, but po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litique reasons, <hi>Zach.</hi> 7.5, 6.

            <p>O then when we weep and seperate our selves, let us not think to <hi>mock God</hi> with empty <hi>ceremonies</hi> of Repentance, let us not assemble our selves, only to flatter away the rod from our back, and to get peace and security to our owne persons, and then let the favour of God, the power of his Grace, the comforts of his Spirit be as unregarded as before: (as if we fasted and prayed onely for our <hi>backs</hi> and bellies, not for our <hi>Consciences</hi> or conversations) for be we well assured, he who doth not aske the things which he ought, shall not obtain the things which he asks: such a prayer begs nothing but a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall.</p>
            <p>We have now many fasts together, prayed for making up our breaches, for reparing our ruines, for composing our distractions, for reducing this Kingdom unto an happy constitution, for a right understanding between the King and his great Councell. These prayers we have not found yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn like <hi>Noahs</hi> Dove, with an Olive branch, a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious answer unto us again. What's the reason? Where's the obstruction? Is not he a God that heareth prayers? Is it not his Title? Doth he not glory in it? Certainly mercies stop not at God, but at us. <hi>We are not straitned in him, but in our own bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els:</hi> If there come but a little light into a room, the defect is not in the Sun, but in the narrowness of the window; if a vessell fill but slowly, the fault is not any emptiness in the Fountain, but the small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the pipe. If mercies ripen slowly, or stop at
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:102469:39"/>
any time in the way, it is not because they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to come to us, but because we are unfit to enjoy them. Our prayers doubtless, in many of us, have not been words taken from him, but from our own carnal dictates.</p>
            <p>We would fain have things well in our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, but have we hitherto looked after our consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences? The destractions without us, have they dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us to consider the distempers within, or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire the things above? The unsetledness of peace in the Kingdom, hath it awakened us to secure our peace with God? We would fain have better times, but have we yet laboured for better hearts?<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Semper dies mali in seculo, boni in Deo, Aug. in</hi> Psalm 33.</note> we would fain have a right understanding between the King and his great Councel, but have we yet sadly set about it, to have a more clear and sweet Communion between us and our God? we long to see more good laws, but are we yet come to the care of good lives?

Gods presence drawing forth his praises, as the returne of the Sun in a spring and summer, causeth the earth to thrust forth her fruits and flowers, that they may as it were meet, &amp; do homage to the fountain of their beauty. If <hi>Hezekiah</hi> may be delivered from <hi>death, Isa.</hi> 38.20. If <hi>David</hi> from <hi>guilt,</hi> Psal. 51.14. they promise to sing aloud of so great mercy, and to take others into the consort, <hi>I will teach transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours thy way, and we will sing upon the stringed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments.</hi> Guilt stops the mouth, and makes it <hi>speechlesse,</hi> Matth. 22.12. that it cannot answer for one of a thousand sins, nor acknowledge one of a thousand mercies. When <hi>Iacob</hi> begged Gods bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing on him in his journy, he vowed a vow of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and thankfulnesse to the Lord, seconding Gods promises of <hi>mercy,</hi> with his promises of <hi>praise,</hi> and answering all the parts thereof, <hi>If God will be with me, and keep me, I will be his, and he shall be mine.</hi> If he single out me and my seed, to set us up as marks for his Angels to descend unto with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and mercy, and will indeed <hi>give this Land to us,</hi> and returne <hi>me unto my fathers house</hi>; then this stone which I have set up for a pillar &amp; monument,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102469:61"/>
shall be <hi>Gods house,</hi> for me and my seed to praise him in; and accordingly we finde <hi>he built an Altar there,</hi> and changed the name of that place, calling it the <hi>House of God,</hi> and God, the <hi>God of Bethel.</hi> And lastly, if God indeed will not leave nor forsake me, but will give so rich a land as this unto me, I will surely return a homage back, and of his own, <hi>I will give the tenth unto him againe.</hi> So punctuall is this holy man to restipulate for each <hi>distinct promise</hi> a <hi>distinct praise,</hi> and to take the quality of his <hi>vows</hi> from the quality of Gods <hi>mercies,</hi> Gen. 28. v. 20.22. compared with v. 13.15. <hi>Gen.</hi> 35.6.7.14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 15.

            <p>Our Saviour bids his disciples cast their net in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sea, and when they had drawn their net, he bids them bring of the fish which they had then caught, and yet we finde that there was a fire of coales, and fish laid thereon, and bread provided on the land before. <hi>Iohn</hi> 21.6, 9, 10. Thereby teaching us that he did not use their industrie for any neede that he had of it, but because he would honour them so far as to let them honour him with their obedience.

            <p>This then is a strong argument to be used in prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for pardon, for grace, for any spirituall mercie. Lord, if I perish, I shall not praise thee, I shall not be meete for my Masters uses. Thy glory will one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be forced out of me with blowes, like fire out of a flint, or water out of a rock.

Now we are not meete Subjects for God to reap honor from, till sinne be pardoned, till grace be confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:102469:76"/>
hath often been forced to befoole it selfe, and to beshrew its own ignorance, and with <hi>Ephraim</hi> to smite upon the thigh.

            <p n="4">4. By a <hi>love to Christ,</hi> and a sweet recounting of the mercies of God in him. The lesse a man loves sinne, the more he shall love Christ. Now repentance works an hatred of sinne, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon a love of Christ, which love is ever opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and putting forth it self towards holinesse of life. As the <hi>Love of God</hi> in Christ towards us worketh <hi>forgivenesse</hi> of sinne: so <hi>our</hi> reciprocall <hi>love,</hi> wrought by the feeling and comfort of that forgivenesse, worketh in us an <hi>hatred</hi> of sinne. A <hi>direct</hi> love begets a <hi>Reflect</hi> love, as the heat wrought in the earth strikes back a heat up into the aire againe. The woman in the Gospel <hi>having much forgiven her, loved much,</hi> Luke 7.47. <hi>Wee love him because he loved us first</hi>; and love will not suffer a man to wrong the thing which hee loves. What man ever threw away Jewels or money when he might have kept them? except when the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:102469:76"/>
predominant love of something better made these things comparatively hatefull, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.26. What woman could bee perswaded to throw away her sucking child from her breast unto Swine or Dogs to devoure it? Our love to Christ, and his Law, will not suffer us to cast him off, or to throw his Law behind our backs. <hi>New obedience</hi> is over joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto <hi>pardon</hi> of sinne and repentance for it, by the method of Gods <hi>Decrees,</hi> by the order and chaine of Salvation, and ariseth out of the <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall character</hi> and disposition of a childe of God. We are not Sonnes only by <hi>Adoption,</hi> appointed to a <hi>new inheritance</hi>; but we are Sons by <hi>Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> also, partakers of a <hi>new nature,</hi> designed unto a <hi>new life,</hi> joyned unto a <hi>new head,</hi> descended from a <hi>new Adam,</hi> unto whom therefore we are in the power of his Resurrection, and in the fellowship of his suffrings to be made conformable, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.10. And the Apostle hath many excellent and weighty arguments to inforce this upon us, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>If then ye be risen with Christ, seek those things that are above, where Christ is sitting on the right hand of God. Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth. For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God; when Christ who is our life shall appeare, then shall ye also appeare with him in glory.</hi> 1. Our fellowship with Christ; wee are <hi>risen with him</hi>; what he did <hi>corporally for us,</hi> hee doth the same <hi>spiritually in us.</hi> As a Saviour and <hi>Mediatour,</hi> he died and rose <hi>alone</hi>; But as a <hi>Head and second Adam,</hi> he never did anything but his mysticall Body and seed were so taken into the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:102469:77"/>
of it, as to be made conformable unto it. Therefore if he rose as a <hi>Saviour</hi> to <hi>justifie us,</hi> we must as <hi>members</hi> be therein fashioned unto him, and rise spiritually by heavenly-mindednesse, and a new life to <hi>glorifie him.</hi> 2. We must have our affections in Heaven, because <hi>Christ is there.</hi> The heart ever turns towards its treasure; where the body is, thither will the Eagles resort. 3. He is there in <hi>glory at Gods right hand</hi>; and <hi>grace</hi> should move to <hi>glory</hi> as a piece of earth to the whole. And he is there in <hi>our businesse,</hi> making intercession in our behalfe, providing a place for us, sending down gifts unto us. And the <hi>Client</hi> cannot but have his heart on his own businesse, when the <hi>Advocate</hi> is actually stirring about it. 4. We are <hi>dead with Christ,</hi> as to the life of sinne. And a dead man takes no thought or care for the things of that life from whence he is departed. A man <hi>naturally dead</hi> looks not after food, or rayment, or land, or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, or labour, &amp;c. And a man <hi>dead to sinne,</hi> takes no more care how to provide for it. 5. In Christ we have a <hi>new life,</hi> therefore we should have new inclinations sutable unto it, and new provisions laid in for it. A child in the <hi>womb</hi> is nourished by the <hi>navill</hi>; being born, it is nourished by the <hi>mouth.</hi> A naturall man feeds on worldly things by <hi>sense,</hi> a spirituall man on heavenly things by <hi>faith</hi> and conscience. We can have nothing from the first <hi>Adam</hi> which is not <hi>mortall</hi> and <hi>mortiferous.</hi> Nothing from the second which is not <hi>vitall and eternall.</hi> Whatever the one gives us, shrinks, and withers into death; whatever the other, springs
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:102469:77"/>
and proceeds unto immortall life. Our life there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being new, the affections which serve it, and wait upon it, must be new likewise. 6. This life is <hi>our own,</hi> not so any thing in the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides. I can purchase in the world onely <hi>to me and mine Heires</hi> for ever; but spirituall purchases are <hi>to my selfe</hi> for ever. And every mans affections are naturally most fixed upon that which is most his <hi>own.</hi> 7. It is an <hi>hidden life,</hi> the best of it is yet unseen, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.2. and though the <hi>Cabinet</hi> which is seen be rich, yet the <hi>Iewell</hi> which is hidden in it is much richer. And as there is a <hi>sinfull curiosity</hi> in <hi>lust,</hi> to look after the <hi>hidden things of iniquity,</hi> and to hanker after forbidden pleasures: so there is a <hi>spirituall curiosity</hi> or ambition in <hi>grace,</hi> to aspire towards hidden treasures, to presse forward to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards things that are before us, <hi>to be cloathed upon with our house that is from heaven.</hi> As <hi>Absolom</hi> being brought from banishment, longed to see the face of his father, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.32: <note n="a" place="margin">Non quiesco nisi osculetur me osculo oris sui.

            <p>Now next let us consider this Care of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance against a mans own more particular and <hi>spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall sins.

Israel</hi> had been guilty of very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny provocations, but when they come to covenant with God, and to renew their repentance, their thoughts and cares are most set against their <hi>carnall confidence,</hi> and <hi>spirituall Adultery.</hi> Their most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained detestations, their most serious Resolutions were against these their most <hi>proper sinnes.</hi> True Repentance worketh indeed a <hi>generall hatred of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very false way, Psal.</hi> 119.128. and suffereth not a man to allow himselfe in the smallest sinne.

the old man be mortified, and every grace of the new man shaped and fashioned in us: yet the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest exercise of that <hi>Hatred</hi> is against the sinnes whereunto the conscience hath been more ensla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and by which the name of God hath been more dishonered. A man that hath many wounds, if there be any of them more deep, dangerous, or nearer any vitall part then the other, though he will tend the cure of them all, yet his chiefest care shall be towards that. As the King of <hi>Syria</hi> gave com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to his Army to single out the <hi>King of Israel</hi> in the battle, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22.31: so doth Repentance lay its batteries most against the highest and strongest and most <hi>raigning sinne</hi> of the heart; and by how much the more a man prized it before, by so much the more doth he detest it now. They counted no silver nor gold too good to frame their Idols of before; their eare-rings shall goe to make them a Calfe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.3. but when they repent, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be too base to compare them, or to cast them unto, <hi>Isay</hi> 2: 20.30: 22.</p>
            <p>The Humane <hi>nature</hi> is the same in all men, yet some faculties are more vigorous in some, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in other; some witty, others strong, some beautifull, others proper, some a quick eye, others a ready tongue; some for learned, others for me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicall professions; as some grounds take better to some kind of grain then to others: so in the <hi>new man,</hi> though all the graces of Christ are in some degree and proportion shaped in every Regenerate person, yet one excels in one grace, another in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. <hi>Abraham</hi> in faith, <hi>Iob</hi> in patience, <hi>Moses</hi> in

            <p>And therefore repentance sets it selfe particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against that sinne as a speciall argument of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity. <hi>I was upright,</hi> saith <hi>David, before him, and kept my selfe from mine iniquity.</hi> Psal. 18.23.

            <p>First, a <hi>Knowledge</hi> of him and his wants; therefore we are bid to trust in Gods providence over us for all outward good things, because he <hi>knoweth</hi> that we have need of them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.32.</p>
            <p>Secondly, a loving and <hi>mercifull</hi> disposition to helpe him.

            <p>Thirdly, a manifestation of that love in some <hi>promise</hi> or other, ingageing unto assistance. For how can I with assurance, and without hesitancy expect helpe there where I never received any promise of it? here was the ground of <hi>Davids,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:102469:88"/>
Iehoshaphats, Daniels</hi> trust in God, the word and promise which he had passed unto them, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17.25, 27. <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.42. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.7, 8. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.2, 3.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Truth and <hi>fidelity</hi> in the care to make these promises good; this is that which makes us so confidently trust in Gods promises, because we know they are all <hi>Yea and Amen,</hi> that it is <hi>impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for God to lie,</hi> or deceive, or for any to seeke his face in vaine, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Iosh.</hi> 21.45. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6.18. <hi>Isai.</hi> 45.19.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>Power</hi> to give Being, and put into act whatsoever is thus promised. That which a man leanes upon, must have strength to bear the weight which is laid upon it. This is the great ground of our trusting in God at all times, even then when all other helpes faile, because he is <hi>I Am,</hi> that can create and give a being to every thing which he hath promised, because <hi>power belongeth unto him,</hi> and in <hi>the Lord Iehovah is everlasting strength,</hi> and nothing is too hard, no help too great for him who made heaven and earth, and can command all the Creatures which he made to serve those whom he is pleased to helpe. <hi>Psal.</hi> 62.8, 11. <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.14. <hi>Isay.</hi> 26.4. <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.14. <hi>Ier.</hi> 32.17. <hi>Psal.</hi> 121.2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.19, 21. <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.2. Now whosoever seeks for any of these grounds of trust in <hi>Idols,</hi> shall be sure to faile of them. <hi>Knowledge</hi> they have none. <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say.</hi> 44.9. and therefore <hi>love</hi> they have none; for how can that love any thing which knowes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? <hi>Truth</hi> they have none, neither of <hi>being</hi> in themselves, nor of <hi>promise</hi> to those that trust in
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:102469:88"/>
them; the very <hi>formality</hi> of an <hi>Idol</hi> is to be a <hi>lye,</hi> to stand for that which it is not, and to present that which it is most unlike, <hi>Isay</hi> 44.20.40.18. <hi>Ier.</hi> 10.14, 15, 16. and <hi>power</hi> they have none ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to heare, or save, <hi>Isay.</hi> 45.20.46.7.41.23.24.28, 29. And therefore that <hi>repentance</hi> which shaketh off confidence in <hi>Idols,</hi> doth not onely convert a man unto <hi>God,</hi> but unto <hi>himselfe</hi>; is it not onely an <hi>impious,</hi> but a <hi>sottish</hi> thing, and below the reason of a man, first to make a thing, and then to worship it, to expect safety from that which did receive being from himselfe, <hi>Isay.</hi> 46.7, 8. These are the three great props of carnall confidence, <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne interests, domesticall treasures, superstitious devotions</hi>; when men please themselves in the <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of strangers,</hi> and have their <hi>land full of silver and gold, and treasures,</hi> full of <hi>horses</hi> and Charets, and full of <hi>Idols</hi>: hoard up provisions and <hi>prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of their <hi>owne,</hi> comply with the <hi>enemies</hi> of God <hi>abroad,</hi> and <hi>corrupt</hi> the <hi>worship</hi> of God at home. <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say</hi> 2.6, 7, 8. These are the things for which God threatneth terribly to shake the earth, and to bring downe, and to make low the loftines of man, if he doe not, (as <hi>Ephraim</hi> here by long and sad expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, doth) penitently renounce and abjure them all.</p>
            <p>And now this is matter for which all of us may be humbled.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 7.</note> There is no sinne more usuall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst men then <hi>carnall confidence,</hi> to lean on our owne wisedome, or wealth, or power, or supplies from others, to deifie Counsels, and Armies, or Horses, and treasures, and to let our hearts rise or

fall, sinke or beare up within us, according as the creature is helpefull or uselesse, nearer or farther from us; As if God were not a <hi>God afarre off,</hi> as well as neare at hand.

The greater sense we have of our owne vilenes, the fitter disposition are we in to

relie on God. <hi>I will leave in the midst of thee an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted and poore people, and they shall trust in the name of the Lord. Zeph.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Isay</hi> 14.32. When a man is proud within, and hath any thing of his owne to leane upon, he will hardly tell how to trust in God. <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.5.28.25. <hi>Israel</hi> never thought of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her first husband, till her way was hedged up with thornes, and no meanes left to enjoy her former Lovers. <hi>Hose.</hi> 2.6, 7. When the enemy should have shut up and intercepted all her passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> to <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Assyria,</hi> that she hath neither friends, nor Idols to flie to, then she would think of returning to her first Husband, namely, to God againe.</p>
            <p>Now from hence we learne, First, the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church in this world, which is to be as an <hi>Orphan,</hi> destitute of all succour and favour, as an out-cast whom no man looketh after. <hi>Ier.</hi> 30.17. <hi>Paul</hi> thought low thoughts of the world, and the world thought as basely of him. <hi>The world</hi> saith he, <hi>is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.</hi> Gal. 6.14. Before conversion, the world is an <hi>Egypt</hi> unto us, a place of <hi>Bondage.</hi> After Conversion, It is a <hi>Wildernesse</hi> unto us, a place of Emptinesse and Temptations.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Backwardnesse of man towards grace; we goe not to God till we are brought to <hi>extremities,</hi> and all other Helpes faile us. The poore Prodigall never thought of looking after a Father, till he found himselfe in a fatherlesse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and utterly destitute of all reliefe, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.17, 18.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:102469:91"/>Thirdly, the right disposition and preparation unto <hi>mercie,</hi> which is to be an <hi>Orphan,</hi> destitute of all selfe-confidence, and broken off from all other comforts. <hi>When the poore and needy, seeketh water, and there is none, I the Lord will helpe him,</hi> Isai. 41.17. God will <hi>repent for his people when he seeth that their power is gone,</hi> Deut. 32.36. when there is <hi>dignus vindice nodus,</hi> an extremity fitt for divine power to interpose. Christ is set forth as a <hi>Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,</hi> which supposeth <hi>sicknesse</hi>; as a <hi>fountaine,</hi> which supposeth <hi>uncleanesse</hi>; as <hi>meate,</hi> which sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth <hi>emptinesse</hi>; as <hi>cloathing,</hi> which supposeth <hi>nakednesse.</hi> He never finds us till we are <hi>lost sheep</hi>; when we have lost all, then we are fit to follow him, and not before.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Roots of true Repentance. <hi>Nos pupilli, Tu misericors.</hi> The sence of <hi>want</hi> and empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in our selves, the apprehension of favour and <hi>mercy</hi> in God. Conviction of sinne in us, and of righteousnesse in him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.9, 10. Of crooked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in us, and of glory in him. <hi>Isay.</hi> 40.4, 5.</p>
            <p>Hereby roome is made for the entertainment of mercy; <hi>where sinne abouds, grace will more abound,</hi> and the more the soule findes it selfe exceeding mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable, the more will the mercy of God appeare exceeding mercifull, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.20. and hereby God sheweth his <hi>wisedome</hi> in the <hi>seasonable</hi> dispencing of mercy then when we are in greatest extremity: As fire is hottest in the coldest weather. God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights to be seene in the <hi>mount,</hi> at the <hi>grave,</hi> to have his way in the <hi>sea,</hi> and his paths in the deepe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Mercies are never so <hi>sweet</hi> as when they are
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:102469:91"/>
               <hi>seasonable,</hi> and never so seasonable as in the very turning and criticall point, when miserie weighs down, and nothing but mercie turns the scale.</p>
            <p>This teacheth us how to fit our selves for the mercy of God,<note place="margin">Mendici cum <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>I will heale their back sliding.</hi>] This is one of the names by which God is pleased to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sele knowne unto his people, <hi>I am the Lord that
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:102469:93"/>
healeth thee,</hi> Exod. 15.26. and, returne O Back-sliding children, and <hi>I will heale your back-slidings,</hi> Jer. 3.22.</p>
            <p>Now God <hi>Healeth</hi> sin four manner of waies.</p>
            <p>First, By a gratious <hi>Pardon,</hi> burying, covering, not imputing them unto us. So it seems to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, <hi>Psal.</hi> 103.3. and that which is called Healing in one place, is called forgivenesse in ano<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther, if we compare <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.15. with <hi>Mark</hi> 4.12.</p>
            <p>Secondly, by a spirituall and effectuall <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> purging the conscience from dead workes, making it strong and able to serve God in new obedience; for that which <hi>Health</hi> is to the body, <hi>Holinesse</hi> is to the soul. Therefore the Sun of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse is said to a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ise with <hi>Healing in his wings,</hi> Mal. 4.2. whereby we are to understand the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious influence of the Holy Spirit conveying the vertue of the blood of Christ unto the conscience, even as the beames of the Sunne doe the heat and influence thereof unto the earth, thereby calling out the herbs and flowers, and healing those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formities which winter had brought upon it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, by removing and <hi>withdrawing</hi> of <hi>judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> which the sinnes of a people had brought like wounds or sicknesses upon them. So <hi>Healing</hi> is opposed to smiting and wounding, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.39. <hi>Iob</hi> 5.18. <hi>Hos.</hi> 6.1, 2. <hi>Ier.</hi> 33.5, 6.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, by <hi>comforting</hi> against the anguish and distresse which sinne is apt to bring upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. For as in Physick there are <hi>Purgatives</hi> to cleanse away corrupt humours, so there are <hi>Cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als</hi> likewise to strengthen &amp; refresh weak and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:102469:93"/>
Patients; and this is one of Christs principal workes <hi>to binde and heale the broken in heart, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store comforts unto mourners, to set at liberty them that are bruised,</hi> and to have mercy upon those whose bones are vexed, <hi>Psal.</hi> 147, 3. <hi>Isai.</hi> 57.18, 19. <hi>Luke</hi> 4.18. <hi>Psal.</hi> 6.2, 3. I am not willing to shut any of these out of the meaning of the Text.</p>
            <p>First, because it is an answer to that rayer, Take away <hi>All iniquity.</hi> The All that is in it, The <hi>Guilt,</hi> the <hi>staine,</hi> the <hi>power,</hi> the <hi>punishment,</hi> the <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish,</hi> whatever evil it is apt to bring upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, Let it not doe us any hurt at all.</p>
            <p>Secondly, because <hi>Gods works are perfect</hi>; where he forgives sinne, he removes it, where he convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth of righteousnesse, unto pardon of sinne, he convinceth also of judgement, unto the casting out of the prince of this world, and bringeth forth that judgement unto victory, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.20.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Their Back-sliding</hi>] Their praier was against <hi>All iniquity,</hi> and God in his answer thereunto singleth out one kinde of iniquity, but one of the greatest, by name. And that first, to teach them and us, when we pray against sinne, not to content our selves with <hi>generalities,</hi> but to bewaile our great and <hi>speciall sinnes</hi> by name, those specially that have been most comprehensive, and the Semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of many others.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to comfort them; for if God pardon by name the <hi>greatest sinne,</hi> then surely none of the rest will stand in the way of his mercy; if he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the <hi>Talents,</hi> we need not doubt but he will
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:102469:94"/>
pardon the <hi>pence</hi> too. <hi>Paul</hi> was guilty of many other sinnes, but when he will magnifie the grace of Christ, he makes mention of his <hi>great sinnes,</hi> A blasphemer, a persecutor, injurious; and comforts himselfe in the mercy which he had obtained against them, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13.</p>

               </note> that they should not ascribe any thing to themselves, their Repentance, their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, their covenants and promises, as if these had been the means to procure mercie for them, or as if there were any <hi>objective</hi> grounds of <hi>lovelines</hi> in them to stirre up the love of God towards them. It is not for their sake that he doth it, but for his own, <hi>The Lord sets his love upon them because he loved them.</hi> Deut. 7.7, 8. <hi>not for your sakes doe I this,</hi> saith the Lord God, <hi>be it known unto you.</hi> Ezek. 36.22.32. <hi>He will have mercy because he will have mercy.</hi> Rom. 9.15.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>To support them,</hi> above the guilt of their greatest sinnes. Men think nothing more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie while they live in sinne, and are not affected with the weight and hainousnesse of it, then to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve mercie and pardon. But when the soule in conversion unto God, feeles the heavie burden of some great sinnes, when it considers its rebellion, and Apostacie, and backesliding from God, It will then be very apt to think God will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give nor heale so great wickednesse as this; There is a <hi>naturall Novatianisme</hi> in the timerous consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of convinced sinners, to doubt and question pardon for sinnes of Apostacie and falling after repentance. Therefore in this case God takes a penitent off from the consideration of himself by his <hi>own thoughts,</hi> unto the <hi>height</hi> and excellencie of <hi>his Thoughts</hi> who knowes how to pardon abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, <hi>Isay.</hi> 55.7, 8, 9. <hi>Ier.</hi> 29.11. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.3. <hi>Nothing is too hard for love</hi> especially free-love,

Now up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Repentance and Conversion, God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth not onely to love them freely, but to clear up his Countenance towards them, to make them by the Removall of Judgements to see and know the ftuits of his free love and bounty unto them. When <hi>David</hi> called <hi>Absolom</hi> home from banishment, this was an effect of <hi>love</hi>; but when he said, <hi>let him not see my face,</hi> this was the continuation of <hi>Anger</hi>; but at last when he admitted him into his presence and kissed him, here that Anger was turned away from him too. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.21.24.33.</p>

            <p>Fourthly, when the <hi>true Physician</hi> comes, he shuts the door against him, refuseth his counsell, reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his receipts, quarrels with his medicines; they are too bitter, or too strong and purging; or too sharp and searching; he will not be healed at all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it may be his own way, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.24, 25. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.16. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24.13. <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.37. <hi>Ier.</hi> 13.11. Thus we have taken a view of the Patient, <hi>Sick,</hi> weake, pained, consumed, deformed, <hi>wounded,</hi> and sore bruised: <hi>without power</hi> or help at <hi>home, without friends</hi> abroad: <hi>no sense</hi> of danger, <hi>no desire</hi> of change: patient of his disease, impatient of his cure: but one meanes in the world to helpe him, and he unable to procure it; and being offered to him, unwilling to entertaine it; who can expect after all this, but to hear the knell ring, and to see the grave opened for such a sick person as this?</p>
            <p>Now let us take a view of the <hi>Physician.</hi> Surely an ordinary one would be so farre from visiting such a Patient,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 14.</note> that in so desperate a condition as this, he would quite forsake him: As their use is to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:102469:100"/>
leave their Patients when they lie a dying. Here then observe the singular goodnesse of this phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician.</p>
            <p>First, though other <hi>Physicians</hi> judge of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease when it is brought unto them, yet the <hi>Patient</hi> first feels it and complaines of it himselfe; but this Physician giveth the Patient the very feeling of his disease, and is faine to take notice of that as well as to minister the cure. <hi>He went on frowardly in the way of his heart,</hi> saith the Lord, and pleased himself in his owne ill condition, <hi>I have seene his way, and will heale him,</hi> Isay. 57, 17.18.</p>
            <p>Secondly, other Patients send for the Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and use many intreaties to be visited and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken by him. Here the Physician comes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent for, and intreates the sick person to be healed. The world is undone by falling off from God, and yet God is the first that begins the reconciliation; and the stick of it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n the world, and not in him: and therefore there is a great Emphasis in the Apostles expression, God was in Christ <hi>reconciling the world to himself,</hi> not himself unto the world; <hi>He intreats us to be reconciled,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.19.20. He is <hi>found of them that sought him not,</hi> Isai. 65.1. and his office is not onely <hi>to save,</hi> but to <hi>seeke</hi> that which was lost.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, other <hi>Physicians</hi> are well used, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained with respect and honour: but our Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent here neglects and misuseth his Physician, falls from him, betakes himself unto Mountebanks and Physicians of no value; yet he insists on his mercy, and comes when he is forsaken, when he is repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.

               <hi>I have spread out my hands all the day unto a Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious people,</hi> Isai. 65.2.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, other Physicians have usually ample and honourable rewards for the attendance they give; but this Physician comes onely out of love,<note place="margin">

               <hi>heales freely,</hi> nay is bountifull to his Patient, doth not onely heale him, but bestows gifts upon him gives the visit, gives the physick, sends the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and servants who watch &amp; keep the Patient.</p>
            <p>Lastly, other Physicians prescribe a bitter poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the sick person to take; this Physician drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of the bitterest himself; others prescribe the sore to be launced, this Physician is wounded and smitten himself: others order the Patient to bleed, here the physician bleeds himselfe: yea he is not onely the <hi>Physician</hi> but the <hi>Physick,</hi> and gives him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, his own flesh, his own blood, for a purgative, a cordiall, a plaister to the soul of his Patient; Dies himselfe, that his Patient may live, and <hi>by his stripes we are healed,</hi> Isai. 53.5.</p>
            <p>We should from all this learne, First, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the unsearchable Riches of the mercy of our God,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 15.</note> who is pleased in our misery to <hi>prevent us</hi> with goodnesse, and when we neither felt our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, nor desired a remedy, is pleased to <hi>convince us</hi> of our sinnes, <hi>Thou hast fallen by thine iniquity; To invite us</hi> to repentance, <hi>O Israel returne unto the Lord thy God:</hi> To <hi>put words into our mouth,</hi> and to draw our petition for us, <hi>Take with you words, and say unto him, take away all iniquity,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>If being convinced, he did not <hi>invite</hi> us to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, we should run away from him as <hi>Adam</hi> did.

It is not, I think, insolent in the Scripture, for the words <hi>Age,</hi> or <hi>World,</hi> to be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>restrained</hi> to the <hi>Church.</hi> Now, as <hi>Israel</hi> was God's <hi>First-born,</hi> and the <hi>first fruits</hi> of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.22. <hi>Ierem.</hi> 31.9. <hi>Ier.</hi> 2.3. So the Church of <hi>Israel</hi> is called the <hi>Church of the First-born,</hi> Hebr. 12.23. and the <hi>first Tabernacle,</hi> and a <hi>worldly Sanctuary.</hi> Hebr. 9.1.8. and <hi>Ierusalem that now is,</hi> Gal. 4.25. And then by the <hi>World to come,</hi> we are to understand the <hi>Christian Church</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to be planted; for so frequently in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is the <hi>Evangelical Church</hi> called the <hi>World to come,</hi> and the <hi>last dayes,</hi> and the <hi>ends of the world,</hi> and the things thereunto belonging, <hi>Things to come,</hi> which had been <hi>hidden from former ages,</hi> and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, and were by the ministery of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles made known unto the <hi>Church</hi> in their time, which the <hi>Prophets and righte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And, Unto Angels he did not put in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection <hi>the world to come, Heb.</hi> 2.5. and, Christ was made an high Priest of <hi>good things to come, Heb.</hi> 9.11. and, The Law had a shadow of <hi>good things to come, Heb.</hi> 10.1. and the times of the Gospel are called <hi>Ages to come,</hi> Ephes. 2.7. and the <hi>ends of the world,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.11. Thus legal and Evangelical dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations are usually distinguished by the names of <hi>Times past,</hi> and the <hi>last dayes or times to come,</hi> Hebr. 1.1. Ephes. 3.9, 10. Colos. 1.25, 26.

            <p>The meaning then of the place seems to be this: That sinnes of high and <hi>desperate presumption,</hi> committed <hi>maliciously</hi> against <hi>known light,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>evidence of Gods Spirit,</hi> as they had <hi>no Sacrifice</hi> or <hi>expiation</hi> allowed for them in the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer world,</hi> or state of the <hi>Iewish Church,</hi> but they who in that manner despised <hi>Moses</hi> and his Law, though delivered but by Angels, <hi>died without mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Numb<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:102469:105"/>
neither the <hi>open enemies</hi> of Christ in the <hi>one,</hi> nor the <hi>false professors</hi> of Christ in the <hi>other,</hi> committing this sin, should be capable of pardon.</p>
            <p>This doctrine of <hi>Apostacy</hi> or Back-sliding, is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of a more large explication: but having hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it formerly on <hi>Hebr.</hi> 3.12. I shall add but two words more.</p>
            <p>First, that we should beware above all other sins, of this, of <hi>falling</hi> in soul as old <hi>Eli</hi> did in body, <hi>backward,</hi> and so hazarding our salvation; if once we have shaken hands with sin, never take ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with it any more, but say as <hi>Israel</hi> here, <hi>What have I to do any more with Idols?</hi> The Church should be <hi>like Mount Sion, that cannot be moved.</hi> It is a sad and sick temper of a Church to tosse from one side to another, and then especially when she should be healed, to be <hi>carried about with every winde.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, We should not be so terrified by any sin, which our soul mourns and labours under, and our heart turneth from, as thereby to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held from going to the Physician for pardon and healing. Had he not great power and mercy, did he not <hi>love freely,</hi> without respect of <hi>persons,</hi> and <hi>pardon freely</hi> without respect of <hi>sins,</hi> wee might then be affraid of going to him: but when he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth forgivenesse to <hi>all kindes, iniquity, trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, sin,</hi> Exod. 34.6. and hath actually par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned the <hi>greatest sinners, Manasses, Mary Madalen, Paul,</hi> Publicans, harlots, backsliders; we should though not presume hereupon to turn Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy into poyson, and his grace into wantonness (for
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:102469:106"/>
mercy it self will not save those sinners that hold fast sin, and will not forsake it) yet take heed of despairing, or entertaining low thoughts of the love and mercy of God; for such examples as these are set forth for the incouragement of all <hi>that shall ever beleeve unto eternall life,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.16. And the <hi>thoughts and wayes</hi> which God hath to pardon sin are <hi>above our thoughts and wayes,</hi> whereby we look on them in their guilt and greatnesse, many times, as <hi>unpardonable:</hi> and therefore are fit matter for our faith, even against sense, to beleeve, and rely upon, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55.57, 58.</p>

            <p>This is the solid bottome and foundation of all Christian comforts, that <hi>God loves freely</hi> Were his love to us to be measured by our fruitfulness or carriages towards him, each hour and moment might stagger our hope; but he is therefore plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to have it all of <hi>Grace, that the promise might be sure,</hi> Rom. 4.16. This comforts us against the <hi>guilt</hi> of the greatest sins; for <hi>love</hi> and <hi>free grace</hi> can <hi>pardon</hi> what it will. This comforts us against the accusations of Satan drawn from our <hi>own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthiness.</hi> 'Tis true, I am unworthy, and Satan cannot shew me unto my self more vile, then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his accusations I will acknowledg my self to be: but that <hi>love</hi> that <hi>gave Christ freely,</hi> doth give
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:102469:107"/>
in him more worthiness then there is or can be unworthiness in me. This comforts us in the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured <hi>hope of Glory,</hi> because when he loves he <hi>loves to the end,</hi> and <hi>nothing can seperate from his love.</hi> This comforts us in all <hi>afflictions,</hi> that the free love of God, who hath predestinated us thereunto, wil wisely order it all unto the good of his servants, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12.6.</p>
            <p>Our duty therefore it is, First, to labour for as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance of this free love. It wil <hi>assist us</hi> in all <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>; it wil <hi>arme us</hi> against all <hi>Temptations:</hi> It wil <hi>Answer</hi> all <hi>Objections</hi> that can be made against the souls peace: It wil <hi>sustaine us</hi> in all <hi>conditions,</hi> which the saddest of times can bring us unto. <hi>If God be for us who can be against us?</hi> Though thousands be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us <hi>to hate</hi> us, yet none shall be against us to <hi>hurt</hi> us.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if God <hi>love us freely,</hi> we should <hi>love him thankfully,</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.19. and let love be the <hi>salt</hi> to season all our sacrifices. For as no benefit is <hi>saving</hi> unto us which doth not proceed from <hi>love in him,</hi> so no duty is <hi>pleasing</hi> unto him which doth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from <hi>love in us,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.3.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, plead this <hi>free love</hi> and grace in <hi>prayer</hi>; when we begge <hi>pardon,</hi> nothing is <hi>too great</hi> for love to forgive: When we begge <hi>grace</hi> and holiness, nothing is <hi>too good</hi> for love to grant. There is not any one thing which faith can manage unto more spiritual advantages, then the free grace and love of God in Christ.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, yet we must so magnifie the love of God, as that we <hi>turne not free grace into wantonnesse.</hi>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:102469:107"/>
There is a corrupt generation of men, who under pretence of exalting <hi>grace,</hi> do put disgrace upon the <hi>Law</hi> of God, by taking away the <hi>mandatory power</hi> thereof from those that are under grace, a doctrine most extremely contrary to the nature of this love. For <hi>Gods love</hi> to us workes <hi>love in us</hi> to him; and our love to him is this, that we <hi>keep his Commandements</hi>; and to keepe a Commandement is to confirme and to subject my conscience with willingnesse and delight unto the rule and <hi>precep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive power</hi> of that commandement. Take away the <hi>obligation of the Law</hi> upon conscience as a <hi>rule of life,</hi> and you take away from our love to God the very matter about which the obedience thereof should be conversant. It is no diminution to love that a man is bound to obedience (nay it cannot be called obedience if I be not bound unto it) but herein the excellency of our love to God is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended that whereas other men are so bound by the Law that they fret at it, and swell against it, and would be glad to be exempted from it, they <note n="a" place="margin">Sub lege est qui timore supplicii quod lex minatur, non amore ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitiae se sentit abstinere ab o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pere peccati; nondum liber nec alienus à voluntate peccandi.

               <note place="margin">§. 19.</note>Now lastly, when we returne with sound repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance unto God, then God is pleased to give more then ordinary tastes of the sweetnesse of his love, by <hi>removing judgements,</hi> which are the fruits of his <hi>Anger,</hi> from us. This point falls in with what was handled before on the second vers. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I shall conclude with these two notes:</p>
            <p>First, that in all <hi>judgements</hi> God will have us looke on them as <hi>fruits of his anger,</hi> and take more notice in them of <hi>his displeasure</hi> than our <hi>owne suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</hi> When wrath is gone out, the sword drawne, thousands and ten thousands slaine in our Coasts; <hi>Israel</hi> given to the spoile, and <hi>Iacob</hi> unto robbers; a land set on fire with civill flames, and none able to quench them; A Kingdome divided within it selfe; A Church which was sometimes the <hi>Asylum</hi> for other exild and afflicted Christians to fly for shelter unto, miserably torne by the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish and unnaturall divisions of brethren, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerously threatned by the policy and power of the common enemy who studies how to improve these divisions, to the ruine of those that foment them; our worke is to make this conclusion, Our <hi>God is angry</hi>; a God that loves freely, that is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite in mercy and pitty, who doth not afflict wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, nor grieve the children of men; This should be our greatest Affliction; and the removall of this anger by an universall Reformation and conversion unto him our greatest businesse. And I doe verily believe that <hi>England</hi> must never thinke of outliving or breaking thorow this <hi>anger of God,</hi> this <hi>criticall judgement</hi> that is upon it, so as to
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:102469:108"/>
returne to that cold and <hi>formall complexion,</hi> that <hi>Laodicean</hi> temper that she was in before, till she have so publickly and generally repented of all those <hi>civill disorders</hi> which removed the bounds, and brought dissipation upon <hi>publick justice</hi>: and of all those <hi>Ecclesiasticall disorders</hi> whch let in corruptions in doctrine, superstions in worship, abuses in Government, discountenancing of the power of godlinesse in the most zealous Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors of it, as that our <hi>Reformation</hi> may be as conspicuous as our <hi>disorders</hi> have beene, and it may appeare to all the world that God hath wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away the filth and purged the blood of <hi>England</hi> from the midst thereof <hi>by the Spirit of Iudgement, and by the Spirit of burning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, That Gods love is the true ground of removing Judgements in mercie from a people. Let all Humane counsells be never so deep, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies never so active, and cares never so vigilant, and Instruments never so unanimous, if <hi>Gods love</hi> come not in, nothing of all these can doe a Nation any good at all. Those that are most interested in <hi>Gods love,</hi> shall certainly be most secured against his Judgements. Hither our eyes, our prayers, our thoughts must be directed. Lord, love us, delight in us; choose us for thy selfe, and then though Counsells, and treasures, and armies, and men, and horses, and all second causes faile us; though Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than rage, and hell threaten, and the foundations of the earth be shaken; though neither the <hi>Vine,</hi> nor the <hi>Olive,</hi> nor the <hi>figg-tree,</hi> nor the <hi>field,</hi> nor the <hi>pastures,</hi> nor the <hi>heards,</hi> nor the <hi>stay</hi> yeeld any
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:102469:109"/>
supplies, yet we <hi>will rejoyce in the Lord, and glory in the God of our Salvation; sinne</hi> shall be healed, <hi>anger</hi> shall be removed, <hi>nothing shall be able to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate us from the love of God which is in Christ Iesus our Lord.</hi>

They prayed <hi>at large</hi> only for <hi>good,</hi> leaving it (as it becommeth us who know not alwayes what is good for our selves) to his holy will and wisedome in what <hi>manner</hi> and <hi>measure</hi> to doe good unto them: And he answers them <hi>in particular</hi> with all kinde of good things. As in the former petition they prayed in generall for the forgivenesse of sinne, and God in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar promiseth the healing of their Rebellions, which was the greatest of their sinnes. God many times answers the <hi>prayers</hi> of his people, as he did the <hi>seed</hi> of <hi>Isaac, Gen.</hi> 26.12. with an hundred fold encrease. As Gods word never returns empty un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, so the prayers of his servants never return empty unto them; and usually the c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>op of prayer is greater then the seed out of which it grew, as the putting in of a little water into a Pumpe makes way to the drawing out of a great deale more. <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Rebecca</hi> had lived twentie yeares together without any children, and he grew now
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102469:111"/>
in yeares, for he was forty yeares old before hee married; hereupon he solemnly prayes to God in behalfe of his Wife, because shee was barren, and God gave him more then it is probable hee expected, for hee gave him two <hi>Sonnes</hi> at a birth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.21, 22. As the cloud which riseth out of the earth many times in thinne and insensible va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, falleth downe in great and abundant showres: so our prayers which ascend weak and narrow, returne with a full and enlarged answer. God deales in this point with his children, as <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi> did with his brethren in Egypt; he did not only put corne into their Sacks, but returned the money which they brought to purchase it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42.25. So he dealt with <hi>Solomon,</hi> he did not onely give him <hi>wisdome</hi> and gifts of government, which he asked, but further gave him both <hi>riches and honour,</hi> which he asked not, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 3.13. The people of <hi>Israel</hi> when they were distressed by the <hi>Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,</hi> besought the Lord for help; he turnes backe their prayers, and sends them to their Idols to help them; they humble themselves, and put away their Idols, and pray againe, and the highest pitch that their petitions mounted unto was <hi>Lord, Wee have sinned, doe unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto thee, onely deliver us we pray thee this day, Iudg.</hi> 10.15. and God did answer this prayer beyond the c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

desires, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 11.22. God deales with his servants ar the Prophet did with the woman of <hi>Shunem,</hi> when he bid her ask what she needed, and tell him what she would have him doe for the kindnesse she had done to him, and she found not any thing to request at his hands, he sends for her again, and makes her a free promise of that which shee most wanted and desired, and tells her that God would give her a sonne, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4.16. So many times God is pleased to give his servants such things as they forget to ask, or gives them the things which they aske, in a fuller measure then their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires durst to propose them. <hi>David</hi> in his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles <hi>asked life of God,</hi> and would have esteemed it a great mercy onely to have beene delivered from the feare of his Enemies: and God doth not onely answer him according to the desire of his heart in that particular, and above it too, for he gave him <hi>length of dayes for ever and ever</hi>; but further setled the Crowne upon his head, and added <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>majesty</hi> unto his life, <hi>Psal.</hi> 21.2, 3, 4, 5.</p>
            <p>And the Reasons hereof are principally two.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <note place="margin">§. 3.</note>1 We beg of God according to the sense and <hi>knowledge</hi> which we have of our <hi>owne</hi> wants, and according to the measure of that <hi>Love</hi> which we beare unto our selves. The greater our love is to our selves, the more active and importunate will our petitions be for such good things as we need: But God answers prayers according to <hi>his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> of us, and according to the <hi>Love</hi> which hee beareth unto us. Now God knowes what things
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102469:112"/>
we want much better then we doe our selves, and he loves our souls much better then we love them our selves, and therefore he gives us more and better things then our own prayers know how to ask of him. A little childe will beg none but trifles and meane things of his father, because he hath not understanding to looke higher, or to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue things that are more excellent; but his father knowing better what is good for him, bestowes on him education, traines him unto learning and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, that he may be fit to manage and enjoy that inheritance which he provides for him: so, <hi>wee know not what to aske as we ought, Rem.</hi> 8.26. and when we do know, our spirits are much straitned, we have but a <hi>finite</hi> &amp; narrow <hi>love</hi> unto our selves. But <hi>Gods knowledge</hi> is <hi>infinite,</hi> and his <hi>love</hi> is <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite,</hi> and according unto these are the distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his mercy. Even the Apostle himselfe when he was in affliction, and buffetted by the messenger of Satan, and vexed with a thorn in his flesh, besought the Lord for nothing but <hi>that it might depart from him</hi>; but God had a farre better answer in store to the Apostles prayer, and purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to do more for him then he desired, namely to give him <hi>a sufficiency of grace</hi> to support him, and to <hi>magnify his strength in the infirmitie of his servant,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.9. When the Prophet had encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged men to <hi>seek the Lord,</hi> and to turne unto him, and that upon this assurance, that he will not only heare petitions for mercy and forgivenesse, but will <hi>multiply to pardon,</hi> that is, will pardon more sinnes then we can confesse (for with him there is
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102469:113"/>

               <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.17. (though that may likewise referre unto the <hi>pot of Manna</hi> which was kept in the <hi>Tabernacle, Exod.</hi> 16 32, 33. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.4. As our life is said to be <hi>hid with Christ,</hi> now hee is in <hi>Heaven, Col.</hi> 3.3.) By this dew com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing along with Manna<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is intimated, That the mercies of God in Christ, his <hi>daily mercies,</hi> (which are said with allusion, I suppose, unto this Manna, to be renewed <hi>every morning, Lam.</hi> 3.23.) and his <hi>hidden mercies,</hi> to wit, the inward comforts of his grace and spirit, are all <hi>Innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi> and past finding out. We may say of his <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> as the Psalmist of his <hi>Commandements,</hi> I have found an end of all perfection, but these are <hi>exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing broad,</hi> more then eye hath seen, or ear heard, or the heart it self is able to comprehend, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2 9</p>
            <p>Fourthly, It is silent, slow, <hi>insensible,</hi> while it is falling you cannot say, here it is: it deceives the

eye, and is too subtle for that to see it: it deceives the eare, and is too silent for that to heare it: it deceives the face, and is too thin and spirituall for that to feel it. You see it when it is come, but you cannot observe how it comes. In this manner was God pleased to fill the world with the knowledge of his Gospell, and with the grace of his Spirit, by quiet, small, contemptible, and as it were, by insensible meanes: <hi>The kingdome of God came not with Observation, Luk.</hi> 17 20.21. that is, with any visible notable splendor, or <hi>externall pompe</hi> (as the Iewes expected the <hi>Messiah</hi> to come) but it came with <hi>spirituall efficacy,</hi> and with internall power upon the consciences of men, and spread it self over the world by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry of a very few despised instruments; with respect unto which manner of working the spirit is compared unto <hi>winde,</hi> which we heare and feel, but <hi>know not whence it comes, nor whither it goes Iohn</hi> 3.8. The operations of grace are secret, and silent upon the conscience; you shall finde mighty changes wrought, and shall not tell how they were wrought. The same man coming into the Church, one houre, a swine, a dogge, a lion, and going out the next houre in all visible respects the same, but invisibly changed into a Lamb.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, It is of a <hi>soft</hi> and <hi>benigne</hi> nature, which gently insinuateth and worketh it selfe into the ground, and by degrees moisteneth and mollifieth it, that it may be fitted unto the seed which is cast into it. In like manner the spirit, the grace, the word of God is of a <hi>searching,</hi> insinuating,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:102469:120"/>
               <hi>softning</hi> qualitie; it sinks into the heart, and works it selfe into the <hi>conscience</hi> and from thence makes way for it selfe into the <hi>whole man,</hi> minde, thoughts, affections, words, actions, fitting them all unto the holy seed that is put into them: as the earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing softned and mingled with the dew, is the more easily drawn up into those varieties of herbs and fruites that are fed by it.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, It is of a vegerating and quickning na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it causeth things to grow and revive againe; therefore the Prophet cals it the <hi>dew of herbs, Esay.</hi> 26.19. which are thereby refreshed, and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver life and beauty; even so the word and spirit of grace distilling upon the soule, <hi>as small raine upon tender herbs, and as showres on the grasse,</hi> cause it to live the life of God, and to bring forth the fruits of holinesse and obedience, <hi>Esay</hi> 55.10, 11. Those parts of the world which are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der either perpetuall frosts, or perpetuall scortch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, are barren and fruitlesse, the earth being clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed up, and the sap thereof dried away by such distempers. Such is the condition of a soule un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der wrath, that hath no apprehensions of God but in <hi>frost or fire</hi>; for who can stand <hi>before his cold? Psal.</hi> 147.17. Who can dwell with <hi>everlasting bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings? Esay</hi> 33.14. <hi>Feare</hi> contracteth and bindeth up the powers of the soule; it is the greatest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposer of all other unto regular action. But when the soule can apprehend God as <hi>love,</hi> finde healing in his wings, and reviving in his ordnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, this <hi>love</hi> is of an opening and expansive qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, calling forth the heart unto duty, <hi>love within</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:102469:120"/>
as it were hastening to meet and close with <hi>love without</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the love of <hi>obedience</hi> in us, with the love of favour and <hi>grace</hi> in God. I shut and barre my doore against an Enemy whom I feare, and look upon as armed to hurt me; but I open wide my doores, my bosome, unto a friend whom I love, and look upon as furnished with counsell, and comfort, &amp; benefits to revive me. There is a kind of <hi>mutuall love</hi> between <hi>dew and the earth</hi>; dew loves the earth with a love of <hi>benefice<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ce,</hi> doing it good, and earth loves dew with a love of <hi>concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence,</hi> earnestly desiring it, and opening unto it. Such is the love between Christ and the soule when hee appeares as dew unto it. He visites the soule with a <hi>love of mercy,</hi> reviving it, and the soule puts forth it selfe towards him in a <hi>love of duty</hi> earnestly coveting as well to <hi>serve</hi> as to <hi>enjoy</hi> him.</p>
            <p>Lastly, it is of a <hi>refreshing</hi> and comforting na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>tempering</hi> the heat of those hotter Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and so causing the face of things to flourish with beauty and delight. So God promiseth to be unto his people in their troubles <hi>as a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest, Esay</hi> 18.4. The spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all joy and heavenly comfort which the peace and grace of God ministreth to the consciences of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.13, 5.1. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.4. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. is said to make <hi>the bones flourrish like an herb, Esay</hi> 66.14.

               <note place="margin">§. 10.</note>By all which we should learne, first, as to bee sensible of our <hi>owne</hi> personall and spirituall drinesse, barrennesse, emptinesse of fruit and peace, hard hearts, withered consciences, guilty spirits, under our own particular sinnes: So in regard of the <hi>whole land</hi> to take notice of that tempest of wrath, which like an <hi>East winde</hi> out of the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse <hi>dryeth up our springs, and spoileth our trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,</hi> as the Prophet complaines, <hi>Hos.</hi> 13.15.16. and to be humbled into penitent resolutions, as the Church here is. If God who was wont to be as <hi>dew</hi> to our Nation, who made it heretofore like a <hi>Paradise,</hi> and a <hi>watered garden,</hi> be now as a <hi>Tempest,</hi> as a <hi>consuming fire</hi> unto it, turning things upside down, burning up the Inhabitants of the Earth, causing <hi>our land to mourn, and our joy to wither,</hi> (as the Prophet speaks, <hi>Ioel</hi> 1.12.) this is an evident sign, that the <hi>Earth is defiled under the inhabitants thereof, Isa.</hi> 24.4, 5. Therefore as our sinnes have turned our <hi>dew</hi> into blood, so our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance must turn our <hi>blood</hi> into dew againe. If ever we look to have a <hi>happy peace,</hi> we must make it with <hi>God</hi>: Men can give peace onely to our <hi>bodies,</hi> our fields, our houses, our purses, (nor that neither without his over-ruling power and providence, who alone mannageth all the counsels and resolutions of men) but hee alone can give peace to our <hi>consciences</hi> by the assurance of his love, <hi>which is better then life.</hi> And if there should be peace in a Nation, made up onely by humane prudence and correspondencies, without publike repentance, and through Reformation in Church,

in State, in Families, in Persons, in judgement, in manners; it would be but like those short <hi>interims</hi> between the <hi>Egyptian</hi> plagues, <hi>Exod.</hi> 8.15.9.34.

Wee all cry and call for <hi>Peace,</hi> and while any thing is left would gladly pay dear, very dear to recover it againe. But there is no sure and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting purchase of it, but by unfained <hi>Repentance</hi> and turning unto God; this is able to give peace in the midst of warre. In the midst of storme and tempest Christ is sufficient security to the tossed ship, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.24, 27. <hi>This man is the peace even when the Assyrian is in the Land, Mic.</hi> 5.5. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as impenitency, even when we have recovered an outward peace, leaves us still in the midst of most potent Enemies, God, Christ, Angels, Scripture, Creatures, Conscience, Sinnes, Curses, all our Enemies. The Apostle tels us that <hi>Lusts warre against the soule,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 8.11. There is a strong emphasis in the word, <hi>soule,</hi> which is more worth then all the world, nothing to bee taken <hi>in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change</hi> for it. <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.26. So long as we have our lusts unconquered, we are under the woful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest warre in the world, which doth not spoyle us of our blood, our money, our corne, our cattell, our houses, our children, but of the salvation of Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall soules.

            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:102469:122"/>Therefore if you would have <hi>peace</hi> as a <hi>mercy,</hi> get it from <hi>God,</hi> let it be a <hi>dew from Heaven</hi> upon your conversion unto him. A <hi>Kings favour</hi> is said to be as <hi>dew on the grasse, Prov.</hi> 9.12. and as a <hi>cloud of the latter raine, Prov.</hi> 16.15.

How much more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable would it be to have it as a <hi>gift from God</hi> unto a repenting Nation? For God can give <hi>peace in anger,</hi> as well as he doth warre.

What were these evill tidings, To have an Angel to protect and lead them? to have their enemies vanquished? to have possession of a land flowing with milk and honey? was there any thing lamentable in all this? yes. To have all this and much more, and not to have God and his presence, was heavy tidings unto Gods people. And therefore <hi>Moses</hi> never gave God over till he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them his own presence again, with which he chose rather to stay in a wildernesse, then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without it to goe into the land of <hi>Canaan.

unto others. There is an excellent place to this purpose in the Apostle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.15, 16. <hi>But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things which is the Head, even Christ.

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Conversion of <hi>Israel</hi> unto God in their trouble, was accompanied with a <hi>Petition</hi> and a <hi>Covenant.</hi> A Petition imploring mercy and grace from God, and a Covenant promising thanksgivings and obedience unto him. And God is pleased in his <hi>Answer</hi> to have a <hi>distinct respect</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to both these; for whereas they <hi>petition</hi> first for <hi>pardon,</hi> that God would <hi>take away all iniquity,</hi> he <hi>promiseth to heale their backslidings</hi> and <hi>to love them freely</hi>; and whereas they <hi>pray</hi> for <hi>blessings,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us into favour, doe us good, God likewise maketh <hi>promises</hi> of that in great variety, expressed by the severall metaphors of fertility, answering
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:102469:140"/>
to the name and blessings promised formerly unto <hi>Ephraim.</hi> And all this we have handled out of the four preceding verses.</p>
            <p>Now in this 8th verse, God is pleased not only graciously to accept, but further to put to his seale, and to confirme the <hi>Covenant</hi> which they make, promising that by the assistance of his spirit they should bee enabled to doe what they had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken. This is the greatest ground of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that wee can have to binde our selves in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Covenants unto God, even the promise of his strength and assistance enabling us to keep Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with him. Therefore when <hi>David</hi> had said, <hi>I have sworne and will performe it, that I will keepe thy righteous Iudgements,</hi> it followes a little after, <hi>Accept I beseech thee the free-will offerings of my mouth O Lord, and teach me thy judgements, Psal.</hi> 119.106, 108. <hi>David</hi> was confident that God would not onely accept his Covenant, but teach him how to keep it, and that made him the more confident to binde himselfe by it.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Originall,</hi> the words are onely thus, <hi>Ephraim, What have I to doe any more with Idols</hi>? which therefore some would have to be the words of God spoken unto <hi>Ephraim.</hi> But there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more usuall in Scripture then an <hi>ellipsis</hi> of the verb; and we finde this very verb omitted, and yet necessary to be supplyed, <hi>Esay</hi> 5.9. and in this place the <hi>Chaldee</hi> paraphrast, and from him the best in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters,<note place="margin">Solom.

            <p>
               <hi>With Idols.</hi>] The Originall word signifieth likewise <hi>sorrows</hi> and griefe of minde, a fit word to expresse their sinne and repentance. What have we to doe with these Idols and sorrows any more? They can produce no good, they can heare no prayers, they can work no deliverance, they can bring nothing but evill and anguish to us, and therefore we will not follow or seek unto them any more. Here then is a solemne detestation as of all their other sinnes, so of that especially which had most dishonoured God, most wounded their own consciences, and procured most sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row unto themselves, with Gods confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it.</p>
            <p>Then next, follow severall <hi>promises</hi> of speciall mercies: 1. Of <hi>hearing and answering</hi> their prayers; <hi>I have heard</hi> or answered him, or as others render it, <hi>I will beare him.</hi> 2. Of <hi>fatherly care and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> over them. I have <hi>observed him,</hi> or fixed mine eyes upon him. I have strictly considered his condition, that I might proportion my mercies
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:102469:141"/>
thereunto. It is a symbole, first, of <hi>vigilant care</hi> and most intent and sollicitous inspection and providence. <hi>The eye of the Lord is upon them that feare him, upon them that hope in his mercy, to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their soule from death, and to keep them alive in famine, Psal.</hi> 13.18, 19. Secondly, of <hi>direction</hi> and counsell, <hi>I will instruct thee, and teach thee in the way that thou shalt goe. I will guide or counsell thee with mine eye, Psal.</hi> 32.8. Thirdly, of <hi>honour</hi> and exaltation: He <hi>withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous, but with Kings are they on the throne</hi>; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they <hi>are exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, Iob</hi> 36.7. Lastly, it is an expression of <hi>hearing prayers</hi>; God is said to have his <hi>eye open unto the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of his servants</hi> to hearken unto them in all that they call upon him for, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.52. and the <hi>eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his eare open unto their cry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Psal.</hi> 34.15. The Church had before professed her selfe to bee an <hi>Orphan,</hi> that stood in need of tuition and protection: and here God promiseth to cast his eye, and to place his affection upon her, to look to her, to be her <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and guardian,</hi> to govern her with his speciall providence and wisedome, to take notice of her <hi>wants,</hi> and supply them; to take notice of her <hi>desires</hi> and fulfill them; to take notice of her <hi>condition,</hi> and accordingly in all respects to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for her. 3. Of <hi>refreshment</hi> from the heat and violence of temptations or any kinde of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by the Metaphor of a <hi>firre tree</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ever green, and casting forth a large shade, doth afford much comfort and reviving to the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:102469:141"/>
weary travellour, 4. Because the firre-tree though comfortable in regard of the shade, is yet unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; therefore he further promiseth to be a <hi>roote of blessings,</hi> and all kinde of spirituall graces unto them, <hi>From me is thy fruit found</hi>; that is, from me is, or shall be thy fruit, as <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.22. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.13. though the word <hi>found</hi> may here seem to imply and direct unto, an inquiry after the foundation and originall of the fruit here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. Though all thy fruit of good works and new obedience may seeme to proceed from thy selfe and to bee thine owne, yet if thou be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to inquire after the <hi>root</hi> of them,<note place="margin">Certum est nos velle cum volumus; sed ille facit ut ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limus.

            <p>These words then are the summe of <hi>Gods answer,</hi> which he makes <hi>unto the Covenant</hi> of his people.<note place="margin">

               <hi>God heares</hi> and accepts them: They <hi>renounce carnall confidenec,</hi> in men, in horses, in Idols; and when they look off, and turne away from these, then <hi>God looketh upon them</hi> with a fatherly eye of care, providence, councell, and protection, <hi>I have observed him.</hi> They will not say any more to the work of their hands, <hi>yee are our God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>,</hi> nor any longer make lies their refuge; and God <hi>enables</hi> them to do as they have said and affordeth comfort and refreshment unto them as the shade of a firre-tree unto a weary tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellor.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:102469:142"/>
Lastly they believe and acknowledge that when they are <hi>fatherlesse</hi> and destitute of all help, there is <hi>mercy in</hi> God to comfort and provide for them; and this God makes good too. <hi>Mercy</hi> of <hi>protection; I am as a green firre-tree</hi>; and <hi>mercy</hi> of <hi>bounty</hi> and benediction; <hi>from me is thy fruit found</hi>; by the one defending them against their <hi>feares,</hi> by the other enabling them unto their <hi>duties.</hi> Thus God doth enlarge and <hi>proportion</hi> his <hi>mercy</hi> to the uttermost extent of <hi>Israels prayer</hi> or <hi>promise,</hi> and when they have no help or comfort out of him, he himselfe becomes <hi>All in All</hi> unto them, making a thorough compensation for every thing which they part with for his sake, and causing them to finde in him alone all that comfort, and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to their desires, which in vaine they sought for in other things.</p>
            <p>The parts are these two generals: First, Gods <hi>promise</hi> enabling <hi>Israel</hi> to perform theirs: <hi>Ephraim shall say, What have I to doe any more with Idols?</hi> Secondly, Gods <hi>speciall regard</hi> to their <hi>prayers,</hi> I <hi>have heard him</hi>; To their <hi>persons,</hi> and <hi>observed him</hi>: illustrated by <hi>two Metaphors,</hi> the one importing <hi>protection</hi> and defence. <hi>I am as a green firee-tree</hi>; the other, grace &amp; <hi>benediction; from me is thy fruit found.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ephraim shall say</hi>] This is Gods speech and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,<note place="margin">§ 3</note> setting to his seale and gracious ratification to the <hi>Covenant</hi> that <hi>Israel</hi> made, ver. 2.3. without the which it would have been null and evanid: for as man by <hi>believing,</hi> setteth to his seal to the <hi>truth</hi> of God, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.33. so God by <hi>assisting</hi> setteth to his seal to the <hi>purpose</hi> of man: but with this great
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:102469:142"/>
difference; <hi>mans seal</hi> is but a <hi>subscription</hi> and confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of that which was firm before; for all Gods promises are <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Amen,</hi> and faith doth not put <hi>certainty</hi> into the <hi>promise</hi> of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.3.4. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.13. but into the <hi>heart</hi> of man concerning the promises, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. But <hi>Gods seale</hi> is a <hi>confirmation</hi> and making efficacious the promise of man, which otherwise would vanish into a lie; all our sufficiency is from him, we can neither will, nor doe any thing further then we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from him both to will and to doe. <hi>Pharoah</hi> made promise after promise, and brake them as fast, <hi>Exod.</hi> 8.8.28.9.28. <hi>Israel</hi> makes ptomises one while, and quickly starts aside like a deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full bow, as Ice which melts in the day, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens againe in the night, <hi>Psal.</hi> 78.34, 38. <hi>Ier.</hi> 34.15.16. to day they will, and to morrow they will not againe; they repent to day, and to morrow they repent of their repenting; like the sluggard in his bed, that puts out his arme to rise, and then puls it in again. So unstable and impotent is man in all his resolutions, till God say Amen to what he purposeth and <hi>establisheth the heart by his own grace, Heb.</hi> 13.9. When the waters stood as a wall on the right hand and on the left of <hi>Israel</hi> as they passed through the red Sea, this was a work of Gods own power; for water is unstable and cannot keep together by its own strength, nor be contained within any bounds of its own. So great a work is it to see the mutable wills and resolutions of men kept close to any pious and holy purposes.</p>
            <p>The point wee learn from hen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> is this,<note place="margin">§ 4</note> That
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:102469:143"/>
our conversion and amendment of life is not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently provided for by any band, obligation, or <hi>Covenant</hi> of our own, whereby we solemnly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise and undertake it, except God bee pleased by his free grace to establish and enable the heart un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the performance of it: or thus, <hi>A penitent mans</hi> conversion and <hi>Covenant</hi> of new obedience hath its <hi>firmnesse</hi> in the promise and <hi>free grace of God. Israel</hi> here in the confidence of Gods <hi>mercy</hi> prayes for pardon and blessings; and in the confidence of his <hi>grace,</hi> maketh promise of Reformation and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of life; but all this is but like a written instrument or indenture, which is invalid and of no effect, till the parties concerned have mutually sealed and set to their hands. Till God be pleased to promise us that wee shall doe that, which wee have promised unto him, and doe as it were make our own Covenants for us, all will prove too weak and vanishing to continue. The <hi>grace</hi> of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the purposes of men is like <hi>graine</hi> to colours died, or like <hi>oyle</hi> to colours in a Table or Picture, which makes them hold fresh and not fade away.</p>
            <p>There is a necessary and indissolvable <hi>dependence</hi> of all <hi>second</hi> causes upon the <hi>first,</hi> without whose influence and concurrence they neither live, nor move, nor have, or continue in their Being, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.28. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3.

And this the naturall and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:102469:143"/>
necessary concatenation of things doth require that that which is the <hi>absolutest,</hi> supremest, first, and most independent will, wisdome, and power of all others, should govern, order and direct all other wills, powers, and wisedomes, that are <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate</hi> to, and inferiour under it, unto whatsoever uses and purposes he who hath the absolute Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and Soveraignty over all, is pleased to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point.

Impenitencie clogs the wing of devotion, and stops its passage unto Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. The <hi>person</hi> must be accepted before the <hi>peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Christ Iesus</hi> is the <hi>Priest</hi> that offereth, and the <hi>Altar</hi> which sanctifieth all our services, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Esay</hi> 56.7. And Christ will not be their <hi>Advocate</hi> in <hi>Heaven,</hi> who refuse to have him their <hi>King on earth.</hi> The Scripture is in no point more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse then in this. <hi>If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not heare me, Psal.</hi> 66.18. Prayer is a powring out of the heart; if iniquity be harboured there, prayer is obstructed, and if it doe break

out, it will have the sent and savour of that iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon it. <hi>The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to the Lord, Prov.</hi> 15.8. both because it is <hi>impure</hi> in it selfe, and hath <hi>no Altar</hi> to sanctifie it. <hi>He that turneth away his eare from hearing the Law, even his prayer shall be an abomination, Prov.</hi> 28.9. Great reason that God should refuse to heare him who refuseth to heare God; that hee who will not let God beseech him (as hee doth in his word, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20.) should not be allowed to beseech God, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.24.28. <hi>Esay</hi> 1.15. <hi>His eare is not heavie</hi> that it cannot heare, <hi>but iniquitie separates</hi> between us and him, and hides his face that he will not heare, <hi>Esay.</hi> 59.1, 2. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 8.18. <hi>God heareth not sinners, Ioh.</hi> 9.31. the prevalency of prayer is this that it is the <hi>prayer of a righteous man, Iam.</hi> 5.16. And indeed <hi>no wicked man can pray</hi> in the true and proper notion of prayer. It is true, there is a kinde of <hi>prayer of nature,</hi> when men cry in their distresses unto the God and Author of nature, for such good things as nature feeleth the want of, which God in the way of his generall providence and Common mercies is sometimes pleased to answer sutably to the naturall desires of those that aske them. But the <hi>prayer of faith</hi> (which is the true notion of prayer, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.15.) goes not to God as the Author of <hi>nature,</hi> but as the God of <hi>grace,</hi> and the Father of Christ, and doth not put up meer <hi>naturall,</hi> but <hi>spiritual</hi> requests unto him as to an <hi>heavenly Father,</hi> which requests proceed from the spirit of grace and supplication, teaching us to pray as we ought,

If God offer it, and he desire it, how comes it not to be received? Certainly there is not any thing in the corrupt
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:102469:163"/>
heart of man by nature which can willingly close with any sanctifying grace of the Spirit of Christ. <hi>Selfe-deniall</hi> is a concomitant in all Acts of <hi>grace,</hi> and <hi>selfe-seeking</hi> in all acts of <hi>lust</hi>; and therefore where there is nothing but lust, there can be no reall volition of grace which is so contrary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.</p>
            <p>This teacheth us to have <hi>penitent</hi> resolutions, and <hi>spiriturll aimes</hi> in all our <hi>prayers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 17.</note> if we would have them prevaile at the throne of grace. We are now under the heavy calamity of a Civill warre: And very desirous we are it should be removed; we suffer and languish, and fret, and pine away, and we complaine every where of want, and violence. But who set themselves to cry mightily to God, and call upon their soule as the Marriners upon <hi>Ionah, O thou sleeper, what meanest thou, arise, call upon God?</hi> Haply we goe so farre, we pray too, and yet receive no answer, because we <hi>ask amisse, Iam.</hi> 4.1, 2, 3. wee are troubled that our <hi>lusts</hi> are abridged of their fuell, or that our <hi>nature</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of her necessaries, and for these things wee pray. But till our troubles bring us to seek God more then our selves; make more sensible of his <hi>wrath</hi> then of our owne <hi>wants</hi>; more displeased at what <hi>offends him,</hi> then at what pincheth and <hi>oppresseth our selves</hi>; we cannot promise our selves an answer of peace. The <hi>Marriners</hi> cryed, and the Tempest continued still, <hi>Ionah</hi> was to be cast over; so long as there was a fugitive from God in the Ship, the storme would not cease. Never can wee promise our selves any comfortable fruit of our
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:102469:163"/>
prayers, till the aime of them is <hi>spirituall,</hi> that <hi>God</hi> may be honored, that his <hi>Church</hi> may be cleansed &amp; reformed, that our <hi>lives</hi> may be amended, that whatsoever forsakes God in us may be cast away. Till <hi>Gods whole work be performed upon Mount Sion &amp; upon Ierusalem,</hi> we cannot promise our selves that he will call in his Commission and Charge to take the spoile and the prey, <hi>Esay</hi> 10.12. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our greatest wisedome is to consider what God calls for, to make it our prayer, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, that his will and counsell may be fulfilled; the more wee make God our end, the sooner we shall recover our peace again.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We learne,<note place="margin">§. 18.</note> that our <hi>performance of duty,</hi> doth depend much upon <hi>Gods hearing</hi> and answering <hi>of Prayer. Ephraim</hi> will have no more to doe with Idols, because God hath heard him. <hi>Prayer</hi> is the <hi>key of Obedience,</hi> and the introduction unto duty. The principles of duties are, <hi>wisdome</hi> to know and order them; <hi>will</hi> to desire and intend them; <hi>strength</hi> to performe and persevere in the doing of them: And all these are the product of <hi>Prayer. If any want wisedome, let him ask it of God, Iam.</hi> 1.5. so <hi>Solomon</hi> did, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 3.9. and who am I, and what is my people saith <hi>David,</hi> that wee should bee able <hi>to offer so willingly?</hi> for all things come of thee. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.14. and the Apostle prayes for the <hi>Ephesians</hi> that God would grant them to be <hi>strengthened with might</hi> by his Spirit in the inward man, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 3.16. the <hi>Principles of duty</hi> are the <hi>fruits of Prayer,</hi> and therefore the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of duty doth much depend on the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:102469:164"/>
hearing, and answering of prayer.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">§. 19.</note>Thirdly, we learne from <hi>Gods observing,</hi> or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a carefull and vigilant eye upon <hi>Ephraim,</hi> that when we renounce all carnall and sinfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, and cast our selves wholly upon God, engaging his eye of favour and providence unto us, this will be a most sufficient protection against all the cruelties of men. One would think when we heare a <hi>sword</hi> threatned, dashing of Infants, ripping of women, the Prophet should have cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led on them to <hi>take</hi> unto them <hi>weapons</hi> to make resistance (and certainely the use of meanes in such cases is necessary; the sword of the <hi>Lord</hi> doth not exclude the sword of <hi>Gedeon.</hi>) One would thinke, <hi>Take to you words,</hi> were but a poore preparation against a destroying enemy: yet this is all that the Prophet insists on; when the <hi>Assyrian</hi> comes against you, do you Take with you words; your <hi>lips</hi> shall be able to defend more then his <hi>Armies</hi> can annoy. Words uttered from a penitent heart in time of trouble unto God, are stronger then all the preparations of flesh and bloud, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that way as <hi>prayer</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> goe, that way <hi>God</hi> goeth too. <hi>Amalek</hi> fights, and <hi>Moses</hi> speakes unto God in the behalfe of <hi>Israel,</hi> and the lifting up of his hands prevailes more then all the strength of <hi>Israel</hi> besides, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17.11, 12. <hi>One man of God</hi> that knowes how to manage the cause of <hi>Israel</hi> with him, is <hi>the Chariots and horsemen of Israel,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.12. What huge Armies did <hi>Asa</hi> and <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi> vanquish by the power of Prayer? 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14.11.20.23, 25. Till God forbid prayer,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:102469:164"/>
as he did to <hi>Ieremy.</hi> 7.16.11.14. and take of the hearts of his servants from crying unto him in behalfe of a people, we have reason to hope that he will at last think thoughts of mercy towards them. <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.10, 14. and in the meane time, when they are reduced to the condition of <hi>father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse children,</hi> he will be a <hi>Guardian</hi> unto them; his eye of providence and tuition will observe them, and take care of them; <hi>He is the Father of the father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, and Iudge of the widow, even God in his holy habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, Psal.</hi> 68.3.</p>
            <p>Now in that he saith, <hi>I am a green firre-tree,</hi> It is a promise made in opposition to all the vaine succors which they relyed on before,<note place="margin">§. 20.</note> intimating that instead of them he would be their defence and shelter, that they should not need to hide themselves under such narrow refuges. Whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever humane wisdome, wealth, power, or other outward meanes men have to defend themselves withall, yet they shall never finde any true and solid protection but in and from God after sound conversion unto him. The <hi>firre-tree Pliny</hi> saith, cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not its leaves, and so yeelds a perpetuall shade both in winter and in summer. To note that sound conversion yeeldeth comfort in all conditions of life. <hi>Though the earth be removed and the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines carried into the midst of the Sea, &amp;c. Psal.</hi> 46.2, 3. <hi>Habac.</hi> 3.16, 17, 18. <hi>However it be, God is good to</hi> Israel, <hi>and it shall goe well with the righteous; he will be for a sanctuary to his people that they need not bee afraid, Esay</hi> 8.12, 13, 14. If you would have your hearts above all the troubles of the world, get un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:102469:165"/>
this <hi>firre-tree,</hi> cast you selves under this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, get into the <hi>Chamber</hi> of Gods providence and promises, and then though the troubles of the world may strip you of all outward comforts, yet God will be all unto you.</p>
            <p>Lastly, in that hee saith, <hi>From me is thy fruit found:</hi> We learne, that though good works be <hi>Ours</hi> when they are done by us, yet they come <hi>from God</hi> who enableth us to doe them; <hi>we beare</hi> them, but <hi>God worketh</hi> and produceth them in us: The <hi>duty</hi> is <hi>ours,</hi> but the <hi>efficacy</hi> and blessing is <hi>his.</hi> This falleth in with what hath been handled in the first Doctrine; and therefore I shall say no more of it.</p>

            <p>Thirdly, the <hi>searching,</hi> convincing, and pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating quality which is in the Word, is a great matter of offence unto wicked men,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 20.</note> when it <hi>cuts them to the heart,</hi> as <hi>Stephens</hi> Sermon did his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.54. <hi>Light</hi> is of a discovering and <hi>manifesting</hi> property, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.13. and for that reason, is <hi>hated by every one that doth evill,</hi> John 3.20. for though the pleasure of sinne unto a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man be sweet, yet there is bitternesse in the root and bottome of it; hee who loves to enjoy the <hi>pleasure,</hi> cannot endure to heare of the <hi>guilt.</hi> Now the worke of the Word is to take men in their owne heart, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.5. to make manifest to a man the secrets of his owne heart, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.25. to pierce like arrowes the hearts of Gods ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, <hi>Psal.</hi> 45.5. to divide asunder the soule and spirits, the joynts and marrow, and to be a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart, <hi>Hebrewes</hi> 4.12. <hi>Esay</hi> 49.2. This Act of discovery cannot but exceedingly gaul the spirits of wicked
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:102469:187"/>
men; it is like the voice of God unto <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradise, <hi>Adam,</hi> where art thou? or like the voice of <hi>Ahijah</hi> to the wife of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 14.6. <hi>I am sent unto thee with heavy tidings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, the plainnesse and <hi>simplicity</hi> of the Gospel is likewise matter of offence to these men, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.10. and that partly upon the preceding reason; for the more <hi>plaine</hi> the Word is, the more immediate accesse it hath unto the <hi>conscience,</hi> and operation upon it. So much as is meerly hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane elegancy, finenesse of wit, and delicacy of expression, doth oftentimes stop at fancy, and take that up, as the body of <hi>Asahel</hi> caused the passers by to stand still and gaze, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.23. And wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men can bee contented to admit the Word any whither, so they can keep it out of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, which is the only proper subject of it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.2. When I heare men magnifie quaint and polite discourses in the ministry of the word, and speak against Sermons that are plaine and wholesome, I look upon it not so much as an Act of <hi>pride</hi> (though the wisedome of the flesh is very apt to scorne the simplicity of the Gospel) but indeed as an act of <hi>feare</hi> and cowardize; because where all other externall trimmings and dresses are wanting to tickle the fancy, there the Word hath the more downright and sad operation upon the conscience, and must consequently the more startle and terrifie.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, the great <hi>difficulty</hi> and indeed impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of obeying it in the strictnesse and rigor of it, is another ground of scandall, that God in his
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:102469:187"/>
Word should command men to doe that which indeed cannot be done; this was matter of asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment to the Disciples themselves, when our Saviour told them that it was <hi>easier for a Camell to goe through the eye of a needle, then for a Rich man to enter into the Kingdome of God, Mark.</hi> 10.25. <note n="a" place="margin">

Every principle of truth which is by the Word begotten in the hearts of disobedient sinners, and is held down, and suppressed by unrighteousnesse, lies there like fire raked up under ashes, which at that great day will kindle into an unquenchable flame.

which wee have refused, and every threatning of wrath which we have despised, shall accompany us unto the tribunall of Christ, to testifie against us; and into the fire of Hell, to upbraid us with our owne perdition! O the dolefull condition of impenitent sinners! If they have not the Word, they perish for the <hi>want</hi>: and if they have it, they perish <hi>doubly</hi> for the <hi>contempt</hi> of it.
