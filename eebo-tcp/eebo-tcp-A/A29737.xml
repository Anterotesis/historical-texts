            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Booke, I suppose will no sooner come abroad; but the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion will be asked, why any man would take so superfluous a Labour, to write that which hath been written by so many; by some so copiously, by some so elegantly, that nothing can be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: To which Objection, I confesse my selfe unable to make a better Answer then by President: For when many excellent men had written the Story of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours, both accurately and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently; yet <hi>Suetonius Tranquillus</hi> comming after them, wanted not his part of Commendation. For though he added nothing in the matter or substance, yet be altered much in the forme and disposition, distinguishing that into Classes and Chapters, which the former had delivered in one continued Narration: as being both lesse tedious to the Reader, like a way marked out by Miles; and more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Informing, where Distinction tooke away confusion. Besides, many have Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the Reignes of our <hi>English</hi> Kings, copiously indeed, but so superfluously, that much may justly be pared away; Some againe Elegantly indeed, but so succinctly, that much as justly may be added: And this, if I have endevoured to doe, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be blamed; If done it, I deserve acceptance. Againe, where many have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the Reignes of some of our Kings, excellently as in the way of History, yet I may say they have not done it so well in the way of Chronicle; For whilst they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist wholly upon matters of State, they wholly omit meaner Accidents, which yet are Materials as proper for a Chronicle, as the other. For my selfe, if in some places I be found to set downe whole passages, as they are already set downe by others, and may seeme rather to transcribe then to write; yet this I suppose may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused, as being all of one common stocke; and no matter from whence the water comes, so it come cleane to the Readers use. Lastly, for the Worke it selfe; I dare be bold to say, that it hath beene Collected out of Authours both Ancient and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne, with so great care and diligence, that if all other Chronicles should be lost, yet this onely would be sufficient to informe Posterity of all passages memorable or worthy to be knowne; which of any other generall Chronicle, cannot perhaps be said.</p>

But seeing after ages can know nothing of former times but what is Recorded by writing: It hath followed that as the first Writers were Poets: So the first writings have been Fictions; and nothing is delivered to Posterity of the most ancient times, but very Fables: Such as is the story of <hi>Albina</hi> (of whom they say, this Island was called <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bion</hi>: though others say, <hi>ab albis rupibus,</hi> of the white cliffes) that shee should be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, so to try their adventure, and by chance arrived in this Island, of whom Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants were begotten. And if you like not of this; then have you the story of <hi>Albion</hi> the sonne of <hi>Neptune,</hi> of whom the Island tooke its name. But when these are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded; there followes another with great Attestation, and yet as very a Fable as these; namely the story of the <hi>Trojan Brute,</hi> (of whom the Island they say, was called <hi>Britaine</hi>: though many other causes are given of the name:) as likewise the story of <hi>Brutes</hi> cosin <hi>Corinaeus,</hi> (of whom they say, the Country of <hi>Cornwall</hi> had its name, to whom it was given, for overcomming the Giant <hi>Gogmagog</hi>:) and that <hi>Brute</hi> having three sonnes, <hi>Lectrine, Albanact,</hi> and <hi>Camber</hi>; he gave at his death to his eldest sonne <hi>Locrine,</hi> all the land on this side <hi>Humber,</hi> and called it <hi>Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of <hi>Monmouth</hi>: for which all the Writers of his time cryed shame upon him; and yet can scarce keepe many at this day, from giving credit to his Fictions.</p>
               <p>And when we are once gotten out of Fables, and come to some truth; yet that truth is delivered in such slender draughts, and such broken pieces, that very small benefit can be gotten by the knowing it, and was not till the time of <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> a thousand yeares after the Fable of <hi>Brute</hi>: at which time, the Island was yet but in manner of a Village, being without Walls, as having no shipping, (which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the true Wals of an Island) but onely certaine small vessels, made of boards and wicker. And as they had no ships, for defence without: So neither had they any Forts, for defence within: scarce any houses but such as were made of stakes and boughes of trees fastned together; Neither was it yet come to be a Kingdome, but was Governed by a number of petty Rulers: So as <hi>Kent</hi> onely had in it (as <hi>Caesar</hi> calleth them) foure Kings; <hi>Cingetorix, Carvilius, Taximagulus,</hi> and <hi>Segonax</hi>: which division, as it made the <hi>Britaines</hi> the more easie to be conquered, so it made the <hi>Romans</hi> the longer in conquering. For if they had beene one united body, one or two battailes might have made a conquest of the whole, where being thus divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, there was need to be as many battailes as there were divisions; So as it was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares, before the <hi>Romanes</hi> could conquer the whole Island; even from the time of <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> to the time of the Emperour <hi>Domitian</hi>; not much lesse then two hundred yeares. It is true, after <hi>Caesars</hi> first comming, the Island grew sensible of this defect of their division, and thereupon by consent of a great part, made choyce of <hi>Cassibelan,</hi> King of the <hi>Trinovants,</hi> who had his seate at <hi>Verulam,</hi> to be Generall of their warres; which made indeed some little stoppe to the <hi>Romanes</hi> proceedings, but after the losse of a battaile or two, they fell againe into a relapse of their former defect, and thought it better to secure every one his owne, by his owne meanes, then by a generall power, to hazard all at once; whereby it came afterward to be true: <hi>Dum singuli pugnant, universi vincuntur.</hi> Yet before the Cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>try could bee wholly Conquered; at first by reason of the Nations valour, seeking to keepe themselves free, and afterward by reason of the insolency of the garrison souldiers, that sought to make them slaves, many great oppositions were made, amongst which the most memorable was that of <hi>Voadicia,</hi> a certaine Queene of the Country, who having beene by the <hi>Romane</hi> souldiers herselfe abused, and her daughters ravished, used meanes to levy an Army of six score thousand men, whom she led herselfe into the field, and set upon the <hi>Romanes</hi> in their chiefe townes, which were <hi>London, Verulam,</hi> and <hi>Camalodunum</hi> (now <hi>Malden</hi> in <hi>Essex</hi>;) of whom she flew above seventy thousand: but then in a second battaile, had fourescore thousand of her owne Army slaine, after which defeate, for avoyding of slavery, she poysoned herselfe.</p>
               <p>This Island for a long time, was so much esteemed of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> that their Emperors sometimes came hither in person; as first the Emperor <hi>Adrian,</hi> in the yeare 124. who made a great wall of earth betweene <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving set the Country in order, returned.

Afterward in the yeare 305. <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> the Emperor came into <hi>Britaine,</hi> and ended his life at <hi>Yorke,</hi> making that City fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for the death and buriall of two great Emperors; and yet more famous for the honor done to <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, sonne of <hi>Constantius,</hi> who in that City was first saluted Emperor. But notwithstanding the great estimation the <hi>Romanes</hi> a long time made of this Island, yet at last, after five hundred yeares they had kept it in subjection, they voluntarily left it: the charge of keeping it, being greater, then the benefit; for to keepe it in subjection, they maintained no fewer than fourescore thousand souldiers in pay, and when warres grew amongst themselves at home, they could no longer spare so many abroad, but recalled them home: but then, though they left <hi>Britaine,</hi> yet they left not the <hi>Britaines,</hi> but carried them, at least, a great part of them away with them; of whom the most were slaine in their service, and the rest planted in that part of <hi>France,</hi> which of them was afterward, and is to this

day called <hi>Britaine.</hi> And now one would thinke, the Island should be in good case, being freed from them that kept them in subjection, but it proved to bee in worse case being at liberty, then it was before in servitude, for being deprived of their ablest men, and at the same time, their King <hi>Lucius</hi> happening to dye without issue, they were left as a few loose sticks without the bond of a Governour: which the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> observing, thought now was the time to make the Country their owne, and thereupon made invasions upon it with all their Forces. Whereupon the <hi>Britaines</hi> having none left of their Native Kings to succeed; and knowing they could ill manage the Body of an Army without a Head: they make choyce of <hi>Vor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigerne</hi> Earle of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> one extracted from the <hi>British</hi> Line; and he, whether so advised by his Cabinet Counsellor, the Propheticall <hi>Merlin,</hi> or as finding his owne strength too weake to make resistance; implores first ayde of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> and they making answer, they had businesse enough to do of their owne, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them to themselves, he then fled to the <hi>Saxons</hi> for ayde; a warlike people of <hi>Germany,</hi> and who had greater swarmes then their hives would well hold.</p>
               <p>And here we may plainly see how dangerous a thing it is for a Nation, to call in strangers to their ayd, and especially in any great number; for though they come at first but mercenaries, yet once admitted, and finding their owne strength, they soone grow Masters, as here it proved with the <hi>Saxons.</hi>

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea</hi> (who buried the body of Christ) came into this Island, and laid the foundation of the Christian Faith in the Westerne parts, at a place called then <hi>Hvalon</hi>; now <hi>Glastenbury</hi>; and that there came with him, <hi>Mary Magdalen, Lazarus,</hi> and <hi>Martha:</hi> and more then this, that <hi>Simon Zelotes</hi> one of the Apostles suffered martyrdome here in <hi>Britaine</hi>: and more then this, that both St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> came into this Island and Preached the Gospell; all which and more to this purpose, is Recorded by Authors of good Account: though it be hard believing, <hi>That persons, and specially women of so great age, as these must needes be at this time, should take so long a journey.</hi> But howsoever it was, certaine it is, that the doctrine of Christianity was about this time planted in this Island, though it made afterwards but small progresse, and that with some persecution; as in which time, St. <hi>Alban</hi> suffered martyrdome at <hi>Verulam,</hi> and at <hi>Liechfield</hi> shortly after, no fewer then a thousand. After this, in the yeare 180 what time <hi>Lucius</hi> was King of this Island, <hi>Eleutherius</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> sent <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganus</hi> and <hi>Damianus</hi> to him: upon whose preaching, the Temples of the Heathenish <hi>Flamins</hi> and <hi>Arch-flamins</hi> (one and thirty in number) were converted to so many Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops Sees; whereof <hi>London, Yorke,</hi> and <hi>Caerleyn</hi> (now St. <hi>Davids</hi>) were made the Metropolitans of the Province. And there is a Table remaining at this day, in the Parish Church of St. <hi>Peter</hi> on Cornhill <hi>London,</hi> which recordeth; that the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof was laid by this King <hi>Lucius,</hi> and that this Church was the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral to that Archbishops See. In the yeare 359. a Councel was holden at <hi>Ariminum</hi> in <hi>Italie</hi>; where foure hundred Westerne Bishops were Assembled, whereof three went out of <hi>Britaine,</hi> and gave their voyces against the <hi>Arian</hi> Heresie. After this, about the yeare 420. rose up in this Island, one <hi>Pelagius</hi> a Monke, brought up in the Monastery of <hi>Bangor</hi> in <hi>Wales,</hi> who spread the poyson of his Heresie, first in this his Native Countrey, and afterward all the world over. And these had beene the chiefe passages in matters Ecclesiasticall within this Island, when the <hi>Saxons</hi> were called in, about the yeare 450.</p>

But though upon this agreement they departed for the present into <hi>France,</hi> yet the yeare follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they returned with greater Forces, forraging all parts of the Countrey in most cruell manner, though still encountred by this Valorous Prince, till hee ended his life in the yeare 901. after he had Raigned nine and twenty yeares. The vertues of this King, if they were not incredible, they were at least admirable, whereof these may be instances. The day and night containing foure and twenty houres, he designed equally to three speciall uses, observing them by the burning of a Taper set in his Chappell; (there being at that time, no other way of distinguishing them) Eight houres he spent in Contemplation, Reading and Prayers: Eight in provision for himselfe, his Health and Recreation: and the other eight in the Affaires of the Common-wealth and State. His Kingdome likewise he divided into Shires, Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds and Tythings; ordaining that no man might remove out of his Hundred without security: by which course he so suppressed Theeves and Robbers, which had formerly encreased by the long warres, that it is said a boy or girle might open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carry a bag of gold or silver, and carry it safely all the Country over.

This Prince was so devout and humble, that he submitted his body to be chastised at the will of <hi>Dunstan</hi> Abbot of <hi>Glastenbury,</hi> and committed all his Treasure and Jewels to his custody. The stately Abbey of <hi>Mich</hi> at <hi>Abington</hi> neare <hi>Oxford,</hi> built by King <hi>Inas,</hi> but destroyed by the <hi>Danes,</hi> he newly re-edified; endowing it with revenues and Lands, the Charters whereof he confirmed with seales of Gold.

This Prince, though scarce fourteene yeares old, and in age but a childe, yet was able to commit sinne as a man; For upon the very day of his Coronation, and in sight of his Lords, as they sate in Counsell, he shamefully abused a Lady of great Estate, and his neare kinswoman, and to mend the matter, shortly after slew her Husband, the more freely to injoy his incestuous pleasure. And whether for this infamous fact, or for thrusting the Monkes out of the Monasteries of <hi>Mamesbury,</hi> and <hi>Glastenbury,</hi> and placing marryed Priests in their roomes, as also for banishing <hi>Dunstan</hi> the holy Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot of <hi>Glastenbury</hi> out of the Realme, a great part of his Subjects hearts was so tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned against him, that the <hi>Mercians</hi> and <hi>Northumbrians</hi> revolted, and swore Fealty to his younger brother <hi>Edgar,</hi> with griefe whereof, after foure yeares Raigne, he ended his life, and was buryed in the Church of the New Abbey of <hi>Hyde,</hi> at <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester.</hi>

It was a Politicke device which he used for the destruction of Wolves, that in his dayes did great annoyance to the Land. For, the tribute imposed on the Princes of <hi>Wales,</hi> by King <hi>Athelstan,</hi> he wholly remitted, appointing in lieu thereof a certaine number of Wolves yearely to be paid; whereof the Prince of <hi>North-wales,</hi> for his part was to pay three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred; which continued for three yeares space: and in the fourth yeare, there was not a Wolfe to be found; and so the tribute ceased. He had in his Navy Royall, three thousand and sixe hundred ships, which he divided into three parts, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting every one of them to a severall Quarter, to scowre the Seas, and to secure the Coasts from Pirats: and left his Officers might be carelesse, or corrupted; he would himselfe in person saile about all the Coasts of his Kingdome every Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. It was a notable Act of Justice, that in his Circuits, and Progresses through the Country, he would take speciall account of the demeanour of his Lords; and specially for his Judges; whom he severely punished, if he fonnd them Delinquents. Warres he had none in all his Raigne, onely towards his end, the <hi>Welshmen</hi> moved some rebellion; against whom he went with a mighty Army, and chastised the Authours; but when his Souldiers had gotten great spoyles, and made prey upon the innocent Countrey people; he commanded them to restore it all backe againe; which, if it made some few <hi>English</hi> angry, it made the whole Country of the <hi>Welsh</hi> well pleased, and sound forth his praises. His Pious Acts were, that he built and prepared seven and forty Monasteries, and meant to have made them up fifty, but was prevented by death. But now his mixture of Vice marred all; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially being a Vice opposite to all those Vertues, which was Lasciviousnesse. For first, he deflowred a sacred Nunne, called <hi>Wolfchild</hi>; on whom yet he begot a Saint, the chast <hi>Edyth.</hi> After her, another Virgin, called <hi>Ethelflede,</hi> for her excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent beauty surnamed the White, on whom he begot his eldest Sonne <hi>Edward</hi>; for which Fact he did seven yeares penance, enjoyned him by the Arch-bishop <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stan.</hi> After this he chanced to heare of a Virgin, Daughter to a Westerne Duke, exceedingly praysed for her beauty, and comming to <hi>Andover,</hi> commanded her to his Bed. But the Mother, tender of her Daughters honour, brought in the darke her mayd to him; who in the morning, making hast to rise, and the King not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering her to depart, she told him what great worke she had to doe; and how she should incurre her Ladies displeasure, if it were not done; by which words, the King perceiving the deceit, turned it to a jest, but so well liked her company, that he kept himselfe true to her ever after, till he marryed.

The young Earle, upon sight of the lady, was so surprized with her love, that he began to wooe her for himselfe, and got her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers good will, so as the King would give his consent. Hereupon the Earle post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the King, relating to him, that the Mayd was faire indeed, but nothing an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to the Fame that went of her: yet desired the King that he might marry

Soone after, the fame of her beauty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to spread more then before, so as the King much doubting that he had beene abused, meant to try the truth himselfe, and thereupon taking occasion of hunting in the Dukes Parke, came to his house: whose comming <hi>Ethelwold</hi> suspecting, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted his wife with the wrong he had done both her, and the King, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to prevent the Kings displeasure, intreated her by all the perswasions he could use, to cloathe her selfe in such attire, as might be least fit to set her forth; but she considering that now was the time, to make the most of her beauty, and longing to be a Queene; would not be accessary to her owne wrong, but decked her selfe in her richest Ornaments; which so improved her beauty, that the King at her first sight was strucke with admiration, and meant to be revenged of his persidious Favourite; yet dissembling his passion, till he could take him at advantage, he then with a Javelin ran him through; and having thereby made the faire <hi>Elfrid</hi> a Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, tooke her to be his Wife.

This <hi>Edgyth</hi> built the Monastery and Church of Saint <hi>Dennis</hi> at <hi>Wilton,</hi> and was there buryed.</p>
               <p>After the death of King <hi>Edgar,</hi> succeeded his sonne <hi>Edward,</hi> but not without some opposition, for Queene <hi>Elfrid</hi> combined with divers of the Lords, to make her Sonne <hi>Ethelred</hi> King, saying that Prince <hi>Edward</hi> was illegitimate; on the other side, the Arch-bishop <hi>Dunstan,</hi> and the Monkes stood for <hi>Edward,</hi> abetting his Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle as being lawfully borne; but while the Counsell was assembled to argue their Rights, the Arch-bishop came in with his Banner and Crosse, and not staying for debating <hi>De Iure, De Facto</hi> presented Prince <hi>Edward</hi> for their lawfull King, and the Assembly consisting most of Clergy men, drew the approbation of the rest; and thereupon Prince <hi>Edward</hi> was admitted, being but twelve yeares of age, and was Crowned King at <hi>Kingstone</hi> upon <hi>Thames,</hi> by Arch-bishop <hi>Dunstan,</hi> in the yeare 975. In the beginning of his Raigne, it fell into debate whether marryed Priests were to be allowed to live in Monasteries upon the revenues of the Church. The <hi>Mercian</hi> Duke <hi>Alferus,</hi> favouring the cause of the marryed Priests, destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Monasteries in his Province, cast out the Monkes, and restored againe the ancient revenues to the Priests and their wives. On the other side, <hi>Edelwyn</hi> Duke of the East <hi>Angles,</hi> and <hi>Brithnoth</hi> Earle of <hi>Essex,</hi> who stood for the Monkes, cast marryed Priests out of their Provinces. The matter being debated in a Councell at <hi>Westminster,</hi> the Monkes cause was like to have the foyle, till it was referred to the Rood, placed on the Refectory wall, where the Counsell sate. For to this gréat Oracle, Saint <hi>Dunstan</hi> desired them devoutly to pray, and to give diligent eare for an Answer; when suddenly a voyce was heard to say, <hi>God forbid it should be so, God forbid it should be so.</hi> This was thought authority sufficient, to suppresse the Priests, till they perswading the people, that this was but a cunning practise of the Monkes, in placing behind the wall, a man of their owne, who through a Trunke uttered these words in the mouth of the Rood, whereupon another Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly was appointed at <hi>Cleve</hi> in <hi>Wiltshire,</hi> whither repaired the Prelates, with most of all the Lords and Gentlemen of the Kingdome. The Synod being set, and the matter at the heighth of discussing, it happened that the Joysts of the roome, where the Synod was held, suddenly brake, and the floore with all the people thereon, fell downe, whereof many were hurt, and some slaine. Onely the Arch-bishop <hi>Dunstan</hi> then President, and mouth for the Monkes, remained unhurt; which whether it were done by practise, or were miraculous, it served the Monkes turne
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52616:15"/>
for justifying their cause; and marryed Priests were thereupon discarded. It were infinite and indeed ridiculous, to speake of all the Miracles reported to be done by this Saint <hi>Dunstan,</hi> which may be fit for a Legend, but not for a Chronicle.</p>
               <p>But now a most lamentable dysaster, comes to be remembred: For King <hi>Edward,</hi> hunting one time in the Island of <hi>Purbacke</hi>: not farre from <hi>Corfe Castle</hi>; where his mother in Law Queene <hi>Elfrid,</hi> with his brother Prince <hi>Ethelred,</hi> were then resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, he out of his love to both, would needs himselfe alone goe visit them; where the cruell woman, out of ambition to bring her owne Sonne to the Crowne, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed one to runne him into the backe with a knife, as he was drinking a cup of Wine on horse backe at his departing, who feeling himselfe hurt, set spurres to his horse, thinking thereby to get to his company, but the wound being mortall, and he fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thorow losse of much blood, fell from his Horse; but one foote being intangled in the stirrup, he was thereby rufully dragged up and downe, through Woods, and Lands: And lastly left dead at <hi>Corfes</hi> gate; for which untimely death, he was ever after called by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Two Acts are related of this King, that seeme nothing correspondent to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall opinion had of his Vertue, one concerning his Mother, the other touching his Wife.

So as, what the vertues were, for which after his death, he should be reputed a Saint, doth not easily appeare. It seemes he was chaste, but not without injury to his wife; Pious, but not without ungratefulnesse to his Mother; Just in his present Government, but not without neglect of Posterity; for through his want of providence in that point, he left the Crowne to so doubtfull succession, that soone after his decease it was translated out of <hi>English</hi> into <hi>French,</hi> and the Kingdome made servile to a fourth forraine Nation.

And because the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are no lesse to be feared for their number, then the Nobility for their greatnesse, he first tooke from them all their Armour, to the end, that leaving them without stings, they might afterward be but Droanes. And because there is seldome any danger from singular numbers, but all the danger riseth from plurality: therefore to prevent conspiracies and combinations, which are commonly contrived in the night, he commanded that in all Townes and Villages, a Bell should be rung at eight a clocke in the Evening, and that in every house they should then put out their Fire and Lights (which was called <hi>Couure Feu</hi>) and goe to Bed. And for more security he erected Castles in the most doubtfull places of the Kingdome. One at <hi>Yorke,</hi> another at <hi>Lincolne,</hi> a third at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> (at that time called <hi>Snottingham</hi>) and a fourth at <hi>Hastings,</hi> where he first Landed.

               <p>Many other insurrections there were in his Raigne; as at <hi>Exceter,</hi> at <hi>Oxford,</hi> in the Isle of <hi>Ely,</hi> and many times by the <hi>Scots</hi> in the Northerne parts; but all these were easily supprest, for they were but scattered Forces; <hi>Et dum singuli pugnant, universi vincuntur</hi>; whereas if they had united themselves into an Army, they might perhaps have made it a Warre, which now were little more then Routs and Riots.

               <p>The greatest and last was an Insurrection raised in <hi>Normandie,</hi> by his sonne <hi>Robert,</hi> the more dangerous because unnatural, for by the instigation and assistance of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> (emulous now of K. <hi>Williams</hi> greatnesse) he entred <hi>Normandie,</hi> &amp; claimed it as in his owne right. His father indeede had made him a promise of it long before, but <hi>Robert</hi> impatient of delay, as counting so long staying to bee little better then disinheriting, endeavoured by strong hand to wrest it from his father. But his father King <hi>William</hi> hearing hereof, with a strong Army passeth over into <hi>Normandie,</hi> where in a battaile meeting hand to hand with his sonne, was by him unhorsed, and hurt in the arme: but his sonne perceiving him by his voyce to bee his father, suddenly leapes off his horse, takes up his father, casts himselfe downe at his feete, and humbly intreats his pardon; which as a father he easily grants, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth his sonne, and ever after, the sonne from the father had fatherly love, and the father from the sonne a filiall obedience. But though his father did thus par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don him, yet it seemes there is a <hi>Nemesis,</hi> or to say better, a Divine Providence, that did not pardon him; for after this, it is observed he never prospered in any thing hee undertooke.

In the end a few Monkes retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and accompanyed the Herse to the Abbey Church; but when the Divine Office was ended, and the body ready to be laid in the Grave, one <hi>Anselme Fits Arthur,</hi> stood up, and claimed that Ground to have beene the Floore of his Fathers house, which King <hi>William</hi> had violently wrested from him; and thereupon charged them, as they would answer it before the dreadfull face of God, not to cover his Body with the Earth of his Inheritance. Whereupon after some pause, agreement was made with him, and three pound was payed in hand for the Ground broken up, and a hundred pounds more afterward for the Ground it selfe, payed him by <hi>Henry</hi> the Kings youngest Sonne, who onely of all his Sonnes was present at the Funerall.

And yet neither was this the last of his miseries: For in the yeare, 1562. when <hi>Castillion</hi> tooke the City of <hi>Caen,</hi> certaine dissolute Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers opened his Tombe, and not finding the Treasure they expected, threw forth his bones with great derision: whereof some were afterward brought into <hi>England.</hi>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">K</seg>ING <hi>William</hi> the Second called <hi>Rufus,</hi> second Son to <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour, appointed Successor by his Fathers Will; was upon the fifth of <hi>October,</hi> in the yeare 1087. by <hi>Lanfranke</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> Crowned at <hi>Westminster</hi> King of <hi>England.</hi> Wherein his Father seemes to have followed the Example of <hi>Iacob,</hi> who gave to his younger sonne <hi>Ioseph,</hi> the Land which he had taken with his Sword and his Bow: for with his sword and his Bow, had King <hi>William</hi> gotten the Land of <hi>England</hi>; and therefore might justly bestow it on which of his Sonnes he pleased. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, there was cause enough, why he should shew this Sonne of his some extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary favour, seeing in the Rebellion of his brother <hi>Robert,</hi> yet he stood firme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for his Father; and in his quarrell incurred no small hazard of his life, as where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he received divers wounds: and perhaps also, his Father thought the rough dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of this sonne, fitter to bridle the insurrections of the <hi>English,</hi> then the soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly disposition of his sonne <hi>Robert.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But though he have thus quietly gotten the Crowne, he must not looke to hold it so; and indeed at his very beginning is assaulted with two troubles in one: for both his Brother <hi>Robert</hi> prepares to recover it from him, and the Lords of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome combine with <hi>Robert</hi> to assist him in it. The first mover of this trouble was <hi>Odo</hi> Bishop of <hi>Bayeux,</hi> his Unckle, who finding himselfe not to beare the sway he expected, and specially for an old grudge he bore to <hi>Lanfranke,</hi> Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> as by whose means, in the former Kings time he had bin imprisoned (the Arch-bishop telling him, that though he might not imprison a Bishop, yet he might imprison an Earle of <hi>Kent,</hi> as this <hi>Odo</hi> was made not long before) he drawes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Bishops and Temporall Lords to joyne with him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But there was difficulty in repressing his Rebell Lords, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their spreading themselves abroad in many quarters. For <hi>Odo</hi> fortifyed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in <hi>Kent; Roger Montgomery,</hi> Earle of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> in <hi>Norfolke, Suffolke,</hi> and <hi>Cambridgeshire; Hugh de Grandmenill,</hi> in <hi>Leycestershire,</hi> and <hi>Northamptonshire; Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert

Mowbray</hi> Earle of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> possest himselfe of <hi>Bristow; William</hi> Bishop of <hi>Durham,</hi> of the North parts of the Realme; and divers other of the Clergy, and Nobility, fortify themselves in <hi>Herefordshire, Shropshire, Worcestershire,</hi> and all the Countries adjoyning to <hi>Wales,</hi> thinking by this meanes to distract the King that he should not know where to beginne, nor whither to turne him. But this course, as it made it hard to represse them suddenly, so it made it easie to represse them at leisure; for being thus divided, they were but as single stickes, that are easily broken; where if they had united themselves, as into a Faggot, they might have made a strength of farre greater resistance. But the King having <hi>Lanfranke</hi> Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and <hi>Woolstan</hi> Bishop of <hi>Worcester,</hi> firme of his side: partly by their Authority and love amongst the people; but chiefely by his owne promises, to restore their ancient Lawes, and to allow them liberty of hunting in his Forests, he so firmely wonne the hearts of all unto him; that some of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell Lords he reconciled with faire words, as <hi>Robert Montgomery</hi>; (a principall sinew of the Faction) some againe he mastered by strong hand, and <hi>Odo</hi> the chiefe Engineere of all the worke, he besieged in the Castle of <hi>Rochester,</hi> tooke him Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner, and forced him to abjure the Realme. And thus this great Rebellion was suppressed: In which it is observable, that though so many hot bloods were up, yet there was but little blood spilt.

            <p>After this storme was over in the South, there ariseth another in the North; For now <hi>Malcolme</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> thinking it a fit time to doe some feates when King <hi>William</hi> was troubled at home; invades <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and having burnt and spoyled the Country, returnes home laden with booties. Which King <hi>William</hi> hearing, he takes his brother <hi>Robert</hi> along with him, and with a mighty Army en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <hi>Scotland,</hi> brings <hi>Malcolme</hi> to acknowledge his ancient homage: and upon Faith given, returnes to <hi>London.</hi> After this, Duke <hi>Robert</hi> finding his brother King <hi>William,</hi> not to keep his promise, in paying his Pension, complaines to the King of <hi>France,</hi> and with his ayde, assaults and takes some Townes, which he before had delivered in pawne for money to his brother King <hi>William</hi>; who hearing of it, hastens into <hi>Normandy</hi> with an Army, and by the mediation of money takes off the King of <hi>France,</hi> and makes his brother, being left destitute of assistance, to aske him pardon: a wise and mercifull course in King <hi>William</hi>; for to buy his peace with the King of <hi>France,</hi> did cost him but money, where to have purchased it by Warre, must besides money, have cost the lives of many. After this <hi>Malcolme,</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> came in kindnesse to visit King <hi>William</hi> at <hi>Glocester</hi>: but the King not vouchsafing so much as to see him, put him into so great an indignation, that returning home, he makes ready an Army, invades <hi>Northumberland,</hi> making great spoyle and getting great spoyles, but by <hi>Robert Mowbray,</hi> the Kings Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant there, was taken in ambush, and together with his eldest sonne <hi>Edward,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated and slaine. This King <hi>Malcolme</hi> was a most valiant Prince, as may appeare by an Act of his of an extraordinary straine; for hearing of a conspiracy plotted to murther him, whereof one was Authour, whose name is not recorded, he dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the knowing it, till being abroad one day a hunting, he tooke the fellow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the company, and being alone, said unto him: Here now is a fit time and place, to doe that manfully, which you have intended to doe treacherously; draw your weapon, and if you kill me, none being present, you can incurre no danger: with which speech of the King, the fellow was so daunted, that present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he fell downe at his feet, confessed his fault, humbly asked forgivenesse, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing granted him, was ever after serviceable and faithfull to him. The death of King <hi>Malcolme</hi> and his Sonne, was so grievous, and so grievously taken of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet</hi> his Queene, the sister of <hi>Edgar Atheling,</hi> that she made it her Prayer, and had it granted, not to over-live them, and so, within three dayes after dyed: a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man as full of vertues all her life, as at this time of sorrowes; whom yet I should

not breake order to mention, but for one pious Act of hers, in causing a most bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous custome of <hi>Scotland</hi> to be abrogated, that when a man marryed, his Lord should lye the first night with his Bride. Which custome by her indevour was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered to a payment in money.</p>
            <p>After these troubles were ended in the North, a new trouble ariseth in the West; for now the <hi>Welsh</hi> men hearing of King <hi>Williams</hi> distractions, enter upon the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> borders, making spoyle and havocke of men and Townes: whom King <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> went with an Army to encounter, but could doe no good upon them, till he was faine to returne to <hi>London,</hi> and provide him a stronger Army. About this time also <hi>Robert Mowbray</hi> Earle of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> by whom <hi>Malcolme</hi> King of <hi>Scots</hi> was in King <hi>Williams</hi> service formerly slaine, finding his service not reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as he expected, enters into Conspiracy against the King; but the King being informed of the practise, seiseth suddenly upon many of his Compl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For after this, though they often rebelled, yet they were in a true subjection. And these for the most part, were all the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of his Raigne: where we may observe, that none of them did ever overtake him, but still he met them, and from none of them he ever fled, but was still the pursuer, and yet so many as might well have taken away all the comfort of a Crowne, and have made him willing to change his Diadem for a paire of Beades, but that Ambition, though sometimes weary, yet never ty<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <head>His Exactions and Courses for raising of money.</head>
               <p>IN the second yeare of his Raigne, <hi>Lanfranke</hi> Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> dyed, who had kept the kingdome and King in some good Order, but assoone as he was dead, the King, as though he were then got loose, ranged without reines, in all licentiousnesse: preying especially upon the Clergy, as amongst whom he found the richest Booties. When Bishoprickes or Abbeyes were vacant, it was familiar with him to seise them into his owne hands, as this of <hi>Lanfranke,</hi> he kept to his owne use foure yeares together, and longer would have kept it, if a sicknesse of his Body had not healed this disease of his minde: For finding himselfe in some hazard of death, he then conferred the Arch-bishopricke of <hi>Canterbury</hi> upon <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selme,</hi> and the Bishopricke of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> upon <hi>Robert Bloet,</hi> two eminent men of that time; but assoone as hee was well againe, it repented him of that he had done, and was not quiet, till hee had drawne from the said <hi>Bloet,</hi> five thousand pounds, and from <hi>Anselme</hi> also good summes of money. For he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented not more in time of sicknesse for the evill he had done in health, then being in health, he repented him of the good he had done in sicknesse; that it may in a manner be said, there was nothing made him sicke but health, and nothing made him be in health but sicknesse. But this preying upon the Clergy was growne into such a custome with him, that he kept in his hands at one time, three Bishoprickes, <hi>Canterbury, Winchester,</hi> and <hi>Salisbury</hi>; and twelve Abbeys; all which he let out to Farme, and received the profits: and from this King, the use is said to have risen first in <hi>England,</hi> that the Kings succeeding had the Temporalties of Bishops Sees, as long as they remained voyd. Having agreed to pay the King of <hi>France</hi> a great
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:52616:29"/>
summe of money, he raised it in this manner; He caused twenty thousand men to be levied, under pretence for his warres in <hi>Normandy</hi>; but when they were ready to be shipped, it was signified to them from the King, that whosoever would pay tenne shillings towards the levying of Souldiers in <hi>Normandy,</hi> should be excused from going, and stay at home; which was so plausible an offer to the Army, that scarce a man was found that accepted not the condition. When Duke <hi>Robert</hi> went into the Holy Land he pawned his D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He sold the Abbey of <hi>Glastenbury</hi> to <hi>Thurstan</hi> for five hundred pounds; and when he built <hi>Westminster</hi> Hall, he made that an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to lay a heavie taxe upon the people, who grudged at it, as done of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. He usually sold all Spirituall preferments, to them would give most; and tooke Fines of Priests for Fornication: as also he tooke money of Jewes, to cause such of them as were converted, to renounce Christianity, and returne to Judaisme, as making more benefit by their Unbeliefe then by their Conversion. He caused divers of the Nobility to pay grievous Fines for transgressing his Laws, though the fault were never so small. He set forth a Proclamation that none should goe out of the Realme without his Licence, by which he drew much money from many; for either they must tarry at home and live discontented, or else content him for giving them leave to goe abroad. And from thence the Custome or Law of <hi>Ne exeas Reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> seemes to have taken its beginning: for Precedents of servitude are sure to live, where Precedents of Liberty are commonly still-borne. These were his wayes for raising of money, wherein Promoters and Informers were his darling servants; and the most officious of all was <hi>Ralph</hi> Bishop of <hi>Durham,</hi> of whom he would often say, there was not such another man in the world to serve a Kings turne. And yet he was not so greedy of lucre but that he did some Acts that may serve for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples: as one time, an Abbey being vacant, two Monkes of the Covent came suiters to him for the place, offering great summes, and each of them out-bidding the other; whereupon the King looking about, and espying another Monk stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding not farre off, asked him what he would give for the place? Who answering, he neither had any thing to give, nor would give any thing if he had it: Well (said the King) thou hast spoken honestly, thou art fitter to be Abbot then either of these; and so bestowed the place upon him gratis.</p>

Being reconciled to his Brother <hi>Robert,</hi> he assisted him to recover the Fort of Mount Saint <hi>Michael,</hi> which their Brother <hi>Henry</hi> did forcibly hold in <hi>Normandy</hi>: during which siege, straggling one time alone upon the shoare, he was set upon by three horsmen, who assaulted him so fiercely, that they

               <p>MUch is spoken of his lascivious life in generall, but nothing in particular: for neither is mentioned any violence he ever offered to any; nor is any woman named to have beene his Concubine, and Princes Concubines are seldome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed.

But why should we more look for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of his Incontinency, then of his Prodigality? for he was taxed no lesse for being Prodigall, then for being Incontinent; and yet of his Prodigality there is not so much as one instance recorded, unlesse we take this for an instance; that when his Chamberlaine brought him a paire of hose, which because they were new, he asked what they cost? And being told they cost three shillings, in a great chafe he threw them away; asking him, If he thought a paire of hose of three shillings, to be fit for a King to weare?

With such like instigations, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all assuring him, there were many in <hi>England</hi> would take his part; he easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded the Duke to that, from which he could hardly have disswaded him; who thereupon with a convenient Army, puts to Sea, and lands at <hi>Portsmouth,</hi> while <hi>Henry</hi> waited for his comming about <hi>Hastings</hi>; and being landed there, much peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple resorted to him, that it was like to have beene a bloody businesse; but by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of Friends, working upon the flexible nature of Duke <hi>Robert,</hi> it was brought at last to this agreement, that King <hi>Henry</hi> should pay to Duke <hi>Robert,</hi> three thousand markes yearely, and Duke <hi>Robert</hi> should succeed him in the kingdome, if he sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived.

After this, another little cloud arose, but was soone disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: For <hi>Robert de Belesme</hi> Earle of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> a rash young man of disposition, but more through discontentment, though discontented for nothing, but that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a great Estate, he was not a King as well as some others, fortifyed the Towne of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> and the Castle of <hi>Bridgenorth,</hi> and got many <hi>Welshmen</hi> to assist him, but the King comming with a mighty Army, so terrifyed the <hi>Welsh,</hi> that they aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned the Earle, and left him a prey to the King in his person, and more in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, for the King seised his Estate into his hands, but for his Person he onely ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht it the Realme. For as yet, the shedding of blood and putting to death, though for great Treasonable practises, was not much in use; Policy of State was not yet growne to that heighth of severity. The like attempt, and upon the like occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was made by <hi>William</hi> Earle of <hi>Mortaigne</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> and of <hi>Cornwall</hi> in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> Unckle to the King, onely for denying him the Earledome of <hi>Kent,</hi> which because he could not obtaine, he entred into Treasonable practises, by which he

lost the Earledomes he had before. But these troubles were but as the labour of a Woman that is safely delivered; painefull for a time, but ending in joy: and indeed for the most part this King had the fortune to be a gainer by his losses.</p>

Thus resolved, he presents himselfe to the King, referring both his Dukedome and himselfe, and all differences and debates to his will and pleasure. But whether incensed with the scandalous words, Duke <hi>Robert</hi> had given out of him, or whether aspiring to joyne <hi>Normandy</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> as his Father had done before; King <hi>Henry</hi> scarce vouchsafed to heare him speake, at least vouchsafed not to make him any answer, but in a sullen man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner turned away, and so left him: which scornefull usage put the Duke into such indignation, that he resolved to set his whole state at stake, and either to redeeme his disgrace, or to forfeit his life. So returning into <hi>Normandy,</hi> he useth all his force in raising of Forces, but King <hi>Henry</hi> suspecting his intentions, and not using to give Insurrections time to ripen, came upon him so suddenly with a mighty Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, that he drew him to a battell before he was halfe ready to fight. Yet desire of revenge so animated the Duke, and the Duke his Souldiers, that never battell was more fiercely fought, and the <hi>Normans</hi> seemed at first to have the better, till King <hi>Henry</hi> shewing himselfe in the Army, put such courage into his Souldiers, that they quickly made good the advantage they had in number, and King <hi>Henry</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a compleate victory, both in slaughter of men, (of whom there wer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>IN this Kings dayes all the foure Elements were guilty of doing much mischiefe, but chiefely the water: For King <hi>Henry</hi> returning into <hi>England</hi> after his conquest of <hi>Normandy,</hi> left his sonne <hi>William</hi> with his sister <hi>Mary</hi> Countesse of <hi>Perche; Richard</hi> his sonne by a Concubine; the Earle of <hi>Chester</hi> with his wife <hi>Lucie,</hi> the Kings Neece by his sister <hi>Adela,</hi> and other Lords and Ladies, and passengers to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of 180. to follow after him: who taking Shipping (and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Prince indeed was got into the Ship-boate, and out of danger; but hearing the lamentable cries of his sister, compassion wrought so in him, that he turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his boate to take her in, which over-charged with the multitude, over-turned, and they all perished: none escaped but onely one Saylour, who had been a Butcher, who by swimming all night upon the Mast, came safe to Land. An accident not more grievous then exemplary; for amongst other conclusions, from hence we may gather, that no state is so uncertaine as prosperity; no fall so sudden as into ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity; and that the rule [He that stands, let him take heed he fall not] cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be observed, because a man happens sometimes to fall before it is possible for him to take heed. Another great mischiefe was in this Kings dayes wrought by the water; for by the breaking in of the Sea, a great part of <hi>Flanders</hi> was drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: whereupon a great number of Flemmings being Suiters to King <hi>Henry</hi> for some place to inhabit; he assigned them a part in <hi>Wal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But the water had another way to doe mischiefe as much by defect, as this was by excesse; for upon the tenth of <hi>October,</hi> the River of <hi>Medway</hi> many miles together did so faile of water, that in the midst of the Channell, the smallest vessels could not passe: and the same day also in the <hi>Thames,</hi> betweene the Tower of <hi>London</hi> and the Bridge, men waded over on foote for the space of two dayes: also at another time the River of <hi>Trent</hi> at <hi>Notingham</hi> was dryed up a whole day. Now for the Earth, though naturally it be without motion, yet it moves some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times when it is to do mischiefe, specially being assisted by the Aire; as in this Kings dayes, it moved with so great a violence that many buildings were shaken downe, and <hi>Malmesbery</hi> saith, that the house wherein he sate, was lifted up with a double remove, and at the third time setled againe in the proper place. Also in divers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces it yeelded forth a hideous noyse, and cast forth flames at certaine rifts many dayes together, which neither by water, nor by any other meanes could be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed. But yet the active Element of Fire was busiest of all, for first <hi>Chichester</hi> with the principall Monastery was burnt downe to the ground: From <hi>West-cheape</hi>

Thus the kingdome from the one end to the other was in Combustion, that if the King had had as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hands as <hi>Briareus,</hi> there would have beene worke enough for them all. Yet all this dismayed not the King, but as having learned this Lesson, <hi>Tu ne cede malis, sed contra audentior ito,</hi> growes the more in confidence, the lesse he was in assurance; and as if danger were the fuell of Courage, the more erected in himselfe, the lesse he was upheld by others; and so, venturing what his Rebels at home would doe in his absence, he passeth himselfe in person against <hi>David</hi> King of <hi>Scots</hi>; as being the most dangerous, and therefore the first to be repressed: but finding it hard to draw him to a Battell, and impossible without a battell to doe any good upon him; he leaves the care of that quarrell to <hi>Thurstine</hi> Arch-bishop of <hi>Yorke,</hi> and returnes himselfe home, if it may be called home, where he scarce had a safe place to put his head in. But though many Lords were Rebellious against him, yet some there were stucke firmely to him, by whose Assistance and his owne industry, partly by inticements, partly by inforcements, he reduced most of them to Obedience, and all of them to Submission; when in the meane time <hi>Thurstine</hi> Arch-bishop of <hi>Yorke</hi>; and in his sicknesse, <hi>Ralph</hi> Bishop of <hi>Durham,</hi> assisted with <hi>William</hi> Earle of <hi>Aumerle, William Piperell</hi> of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> and <hi>Hubert de Lacy,</hi> fought a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Battell against <hi>David</hi> King of <hi>Scots</hi>; wherein though King <hi>David</hi> himselfe, and his Sonne <hi>Henry</hi> performed wonderfull Acts of Prowesse, yet the <hi>English</hi> got the Victory, with the slaughter of eleven thousand <hi>Scots</hi> in the Fight, besides ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other slaine in the flight; where of the <hi>English</hi> none of account were slaine, but onely a Brother of <hi>Hubert Lacyes,</hi> and some small number of Common Souldiers. This Victory infinitely pleased and comforted King <hi>Stephen,</hi> who not long after to make an absolute suppression of the <hi>Scots,</hi> passeth againe with an Army, and inforceth King <hi>David</hi> to demand a Peace, delivering his Sonne <hi>Henry</hi> into King <hi>Stephens</hi> hands for a pledge; and comming homeward, by the way he besieged <hi>Ludlow,</hi> one of Rebels nests, where Prince <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> had beene taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner, if King <hi>Stephen</hi> in his owne person had not rescued him.</p>
               <p>After this, once againe the King got a little breathing time, but it was but to prepare him for greater Encounters: For now <hi>Maud</hi> the Empresse her selfe in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son comes into play; in whom the Oath before taken was to have its tryall; for till now, though never so really intended, yet it could not actually be performed; for how could they receive her for Queene, who came not in place to be received? but now that she came in person, now was the time of tryall, how the Oath would worke; and worke it did indeed with many, and that strongly; For <hi>Maude</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into <hi>England,</hi> with <hi>Robert</hi> Earle of <hi>Glocester</hi> her Brother; was most joyfully received at <hi>Arundell</hi> Castle, by <hi>William de Aubigny,</hi> who had marryed <hi>Adeliza</hi> the Queene Dowager of the late King <hi>Henry,</hi> and had the said Castle and County assigned her for her Dower.

But after long debate, whether by agreement betweene them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or by connivence of the keepers, both King <hi>Stephen</hi> and Earle <hi>Robert</hi> got to be at liberty. When the first thing King <hi>Stephen</hi> did, was to looke out the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse, to requite the kindnesse she had shewed him in prison; and hearing her to be at <hi>Oxford,</hi> he layes siege to the Towne, and brings the Empresse to such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse, that she had no way to free her selfe but by flight; and no way to flee but with manifest danger, yet she effected it by this devise: It was in the Winter sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, when frost and snow covered all the ground over; she therefore clad her selfe, and her foure servants that were with her in white cloathes, which being of the colour of Snow, made her passe the Watches without being discerned, and by this meanes came safe to her friends at <hi>Wallingford.</hi> Yet <hi>Mamesbury</hi> who lived at that time, confesseth he could never learne certainely by what meanes she made her e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape. But howsoever she escaped this present danger; yet it left such an impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of feare upon her, that she never after had any mind to appeare upon this stage of Warre, but left the prosecution of it to her Sonne <hi>Henry,</hi> who was now about sixteene yeares of age, and being forward of his age, and able to beare Armes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It was now the ninth yeare of King <hi>Stephens</hi> Raigne, when <hi>Ralph</hi> Earle of <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> keeping possession of the City of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> was in the night time assaulted by the King; but the Earle perceiving the Kings Forces to be but small, suddenly is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued

forth, and repelled the King with the slaughter of fourescore of his men. Yet two yeares after this, the Earle was reconciled to the King, and came of his owne accord to waite upon him, when perfidiously he was detained by the King; and not set at liberty, till he had surrendred into the Kings hands all the Castles that were in his possession; which though it brought the King some present benefit, yet it wrought him a greater future losse; for it lost him his credite with all men, and no man afterward would trust his word.</p>
               <p>Now was Duke <hi>Henry</hi> come to the age of nineteene yeares, and was in possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Dukedome of <hi>Anjou,</hi> by the death of his Father <hi>Geoffrey Plantagenet</hi>; and not long after this, he marryed <hi>Eleanor</hi> the Daughter and Heire of <hi>William</hi> Duke of <hi>Guyen,</hi> by whom he had that Dutchy, and also the Earledome of <hi>Poicton: Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy</hi> he had by his Mother; but more by the peoples inclination. So as being possest now of foure great Principalities, this greatnesse of Estate added to the greatnesse of his spirit, made him aspiring to recover his Right in <hi>England</hi>; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he comes, bringing with him but small Forces, but promising himselfe great, from the people of this kingdome: and many indeed resorted to him; with whom he fell presently, and besieged <hi>Marleborough</hi>; but by the Kings greater Forces was repelled.</p>
               <p>After this, their Armies continued in the field still; rather watching advantages to be doing, then doing any thing; sometimes advancing when no Enemy was neare, and then retiring when the Enemy came; till at last it was like to come to a set Battell, when suddenly <hi>Eustace</hi> King <hi>Stephens</hi> onely Sonne unfortunately dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Unfortunately for himselfe, but fortunately for the kingdome; For now King <hi>Stephen</hi> being left destitute of issue to succeed, was the more easily drawne to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of Peace, as likewise the Empresse <hi>Maude,</hi> having lately lost her Brother <hi>Robert</hi> Earle of <hi>Glocester,</hi> and <hi>Miles</hi> Earle of <hi>Hereford,</hi> (her two best Champions) was no lesse willing of Peace then he; which being furthered by the Lords of both sides, was at last concluded upon these conditions, that <hi>Stephen</hi> should hold the kingdome of <hi>England</hi> during his life, and adopt Duke <hi>Henry</hi> as his Heire to succeed him. And this agreement thus made, and in a Parliament at <hi>Winchester</hi> confirmed, Duke <hi>Henry</hi> ever after accounted King <hi>Stephen</hi> no lesse then a Father, and King <hi>Stephen,</hi> Duke <hi>Henry</hi> no lesse then a Sonne: and well he might, if it be true which some write, that the Empresse, when a Battell was to be fought betweene King <hi>Stephen</hi> and her Sonne, went privily to him, asking him how he could find in his heart to fight against him that was his owne Sonne? could he forget the familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity he had with her in her firt Widow-hood? But this was no matter for the Writers of that time to deliver: It touched too neare the interest of Princes then in being: and Princes must not be touched while they live, nor when they are dead neither with uncertainties, as this could be no other: But howsoever it was, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it is, that after this Agreement betweene King <hi>Stephen</hi> and Duke <hi>Henry,</hi> they continued in mutuall love and concord, as long after as they lived.</p>
               <p>But what became of <hi>Maude</hi> the Empresse at this time? For, that she was alive, and lived many yeares after this agreement betweene King <hi>Stephen</hi> and her Sonne <hi>Henry,</hi> all Writers agree; and to say that she consented to the Agreement, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny provision made for her selfe, is to make her too much a Woman; a very weake vessell: and to say there might be provision made, though it be not Recorded, is to make all Writers defective in a great excesse. And besides, being so stirring a woman as she was, that upon a suddaine she should be so quiet, as not to deserve to have one word spoken of her, in all the long time she lived after, (being no lesse then twelve or thirteene yeares) is as strange as the rest. And if she placed her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment so wholly in her Sonne, that in regard of him, she regarded not her selfe at all; It deserves at least the <hi>Encomium</hi> of such a motherly love as is very unusuall, and not alwayes safe. Whatsoever it was, I must be faine to leave it as a Gordian knot, which no Writer helpes me to unty.</p>

               <p>OF Taxations in his time, there is no mention made; for Taxations indeed, are properly drawne from a body of State when it is entire, where the State all this Kings time was altogether in Fractions. But what he wanted in Taxations, he supplyed with Confiscations, which by reason of the many revoltings of men of all sorts, could not chuse but fill his Coffers; every Rebellion being in nature of a Purchase to him, for whatsoever became of the Persons, their Lands and Goods were sure to be his. And if it happened at any time, that Confiscations came in but slowly, he had then devises to hasten their pace, for upon light sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions (not so much oftentimes as just suspitions) he would call men into que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, and seise upon their good, as in the case particularly of <hi>Ralph</hi> Bishop of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisbury</hi>; and it may not be unpleasing to heare from what beginning this Bishop grew to such a height of greatnesse; which was thus; In the time of King <hi>William Rufus,</hi> he was a poore Priest, serving a Cure in a village neare to <hi>Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>VPon the Kings seising into his hands, the Bishop of <hi>Salisburies</hi> Castles, and Goods, complaint was made, and a Synod called by the Bishop of <hi>Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>

the Popes Legate, to right the Bishop, where the King was cited to appeare; who sending to know the cause, Answer was made, that it was to answer for his imprisoning of Bishops, and depriving them of their Goods, which being a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian King he ought not to doe. The King replies by his Lawyer, <hi>Alveric de Ver,</hi> that he had not arrested the Bishop of <hi>Salisbury</hi> as a Bishop, but as his Servant, that was to make him accompt of his imployment. To this the Bishop answereth, that he was never Servant or Accomptant to the King: and many Allegations and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bations were urged to and fro, but in conclusion the Synod brake up, and nothing was done. The Bishops durst not Excommunicate the King without the Popes pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity; so in the end they fell from Authority to Submission; and in the Kings Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber fell downe at his Feet, beseeching him he would pity the Church; and not suffer dissention to be betweene the Kingdome and the Priest-hood. And this was no small magnanimity in the King, that he was able to pull downe the high sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs of the Prelates in that time. In the eighth yeare of his Raigne a Synod was held in <hi>London</hi> by <hi>Henry</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> where it was decreed, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever should lay violent hands upon any Clergy man, should not be absolved but by the Pope himselfe: and from this time forward, Clergy men were exempt from the secular power.

By this Queene, he had onely one Sonne named <hi>Eustace,</hi> a Prince more then of hope, for he lived to the blossoming of much Valour, though it came not to maturity, as being cut off at eighteene yeares of age, some say, by drowning, and some by a stranger accident. But strange Relations must not alwayes be rejected, for though many of them be forged, yet some no doubt are true; and who knowes but it may be of this kind, which some Writers relate of the death of this Prince: that being at the Abbey of <hi>Bury</hi> in <hi>Norfolke,</hi> and denyed some money he required to have had; he present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a rage went forth, and set fire on the Cornefields belonging to the Abbey, but afterwards sitting downe to dinner, at the first morsell of bread he put into his mouth, he fell into a fit of madnesse, and in that fit dyed? Certainely, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of Princes are for more observation then ordinary people; and as they make Examples, so they are sometimes made Examples. This Prince <hi>Eustace</hi> was so

            <p>He was borne at <hi>Ments</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> in the yeare 1132. a great joy to his Father <hi>Geoffry,</hi> Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi>; a greater to his Mother <hi>Mawde</hi> the Empresse; but so great to his Grandfather King <hi>Henry</hi> the first, that it seemed to make amends for his sonne <hi>William,</hi> whom unfortunately he had lost before by Shipwrack. The yeares of his childhood were spent at home under the care of his Parents: at nine yeares old or there abouts, he was brought by his Unkle <hi>Robert</hi> Earle of <hi>Glocester</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> and placed at <hi>Bristow,</hi> where under the tuition of one <hi>Matthew</hi> his Schoolemaster, to instruct him in learning, he remained foure yeares, after which time he was sent into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to his great Unkle <hi>David</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> with whom he remained about two yeares, initiated by him in the Principles of State, but chiefely of his owne estate: and being now about fifteene yeares of age, was by him Knighted, and though scarce yet ripe for Armes, yet as a fruit gathered before its time, was mellowed under the discipline of his Unkle <hi>Robert,</hi> one of the best Souldiers of that time. And now the Duke his Father not able any longer to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure his absence, sent with great instance to have him sent over to him; for satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of whose longing, Earle <hi>Robert</hi> provided him of passage, and conducted him himselfe to the Sea side, where he tooke his last farewell of him. Being come into <hi>Anjou,</hi> his Father, perhaps over-joyed with his presence, not long after died, leaving him in present possession of that Dukedome, being now about nineteene yeares of age: when shortly after he married <hi>Eleanor,</hi> late the wife of <hi>Lewis</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> but now divorced. A yeare or two after he came againe into <hi>England,</hi> where after some velitations with King <hi>Stephen,</hi> they were at last reconciled, and

his succession to the Crowne of <hi>England,</hi> ratified by Act of Parliament.

It is true, <hi>Henry</hi> Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> that bore the Kings Standard, was so assaulted by the <hi>Welsh,</hi> that he let the Standard fall to the ground, which encouraged the <hi>Welsh,</hi> and put the <hi>English</hi> in some feare, as supposing the King had beene slaine; but this was soone frustrated to the <hi>Welsh,</hi> and punished afterward in the Ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For his Father <hi>Geoffrey,</hi> Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> had three sonnes, <hi>Henry, Geoffrey,</hi> and <hi>William</hi>; and dying he left his Dukedome of <hi>Anjou</hi> to his eldest son <hi>Henry,</hi> but to hold no longer then till he should come to be King of <hi>England,</hi> and then to deliver it up to his second sonne <hi>Geoffrey</hi>: and he made his Lords to sweare, not to suffer his body to be buried, untill his sonne <hi>Henry</hi> had taken his Oath to doe it; which Oath <hi>Henry</hi> afterward, in reverence to his Fathers body, did take: but as he tooke it unwillingly, so he willingly brake it, and sent presently to <hi>Adrian</hi> the then Pope, for a Dispensation of his Oath: which granted, he enters <hi>Anjou</hi> with an Army, and takes from his brother <hi>Geoffrey,</hi> being little able to make resistance, not onely the Dukedome of <hi>Anjou,</hi> but some other Cities also, which his Father had absolutely given him for his maintenance: yet out of brotherly kindnesse was content to allow him a Pension of a thousand pounds a yeare: which brotherly kindnesse was so unkindly taken by his brother <hi>Geoffrey,</hi> that it brake his heart; and within a short time after died.</p>
               <p>And thus these troubles begun by <hi>Henry</hi> himselfe, were soone ended; but now a trouble is comming on, begun by <hi>Lewis</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> and this is like to stick long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by him. For King <hi>Lewis</hi> not having yet digested King <hi>Henries</hi> marriage with his divorced wife <hi>Eleanor,</hi> seekes all opportunities to expresse his spleene, by doing him displeasure; and a fit opportunity was now offered: for there fell out a difference betweene <hi>Raymond</hi> Earle of Saint <hi>Giles,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> about the Earledome of <hi>Tholouse,</hi> which <hi>Raymond</hi> possest, and <hi>Henry</hi> claimed: in this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, King <hi>Lewis</hi> takes part with <hi>Raymond,</hi> as pretending it to be the juster side. Hereupon are great forces provided on both sides, and it was like to have come to a dangerous battell; but that by mediation of friends, a Peace was made; and to make the Peace the firmer, a marriage was concluded betweene <hi>Henry,</hi> King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> eldest sonne, scarce yet seven yeares of age; and <hi>Margaret,</hi> daughter of King <hi>Lewis,</hi> not past three: who was delivered to King <hi>Henry</hi> to bring up till fit yeares for consummation. This was then thought a strong linke to hold them in friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, but it proved afterward a cause to make the greater breach: and indeed when a sonne is once matched into a Family, the Father must never looke from thence afterward to have a good wish; seeing the daughter thus matched can have no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement, but by the advancement of her husband; and he none, at least, none so w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Why (saith he) what great matter is it for him that was but the sonne of a Duke, to doe service to me, that am the sonne of a King and Queene? Which the old King hearing, beganne to repent him, now it was too late of that he had done. For indeed the honour which by Gods commandement, children are to doe to their Parents; is by such making them their equals, in a manner abolished; at least it gives them stomachs to take more upon them then is fit.

crowned by <hi>Walter</hi> Arch-bishop of <hi>Roan:</hi> and shortly after, the young King <hi>Henry</hi> and his wife goe backe to King <hi>Lewis</hi> her Father, and by him with great joy, and variety of sports were entertained. In the time of their being there, King <hi>Lewis</hi> partly out of his old spleene to King <hi>Henry,</hi> and partly to make his sonne in law more absolure; fals oftentimes into conference with him, and finding his hot spirit to be fit tinder for such fire, tels him, it was a shame he should suffer himselfe to be made a stale; have the title of a King, and not the authority: and that as long as he stood in such termes, that which seemed an honour, was indeed a disgrace. With which words of King <hi>Lewis,</hi> the young King <hi>Henry</hi> was set afloate, and from that time forward, stucke not openly to oppose his Father: whereof his Father ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving intelligence, sent messengers to King <hi>Lewis,</hi> desiring him from the King their Master, to be a meanes to bring his sonne to more moderation. But King <hi>Lewis</hi> hearing the Embassadours name their Master King, with an angry countenance said unto them; What mean you by this to call him King, who hath passed his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome over to his son? and with this answer sent them away. To this evill, another worse was added: that Queene <hi>Eleanor</hi> his wife enraged with jealousie of her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands Concubines, both incenseth her sonne <hi>Henry,</hi> and perswadeth also two other of her sonnes, <hi>Richard</hi> and <hi>Geoffrey,</hi> to joyne against their Father; telling them, it would be better for them that their brother should prevaile, who could not chuse but allow them better maintenance, then their Father did. With these per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions they passe over into <hi>Normandy,</hi> and joyne with their brother <hi>Henry</hi>; who emboldned by their assistance, growes now more insolent then he was before; that when messengers were sent to him from his Father, requiring him to lay downe his Armes, and to come lovingly to him: he proudly made answer, that his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther must not looke he would lay downe his Armes, unlesse himselfe first would lay downe his authority, and resigne the Kingdome. And now <hi>Lewis</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> calling together the great Lords of his Kingdome, and with them <hi>William</hi> King of <hi>Scots, Hugh</hi> Earle of <hi>Chester, Roger Mowbray, Hugh Pigot,</hi> and other of his sonnes party; they all take their Oaths to assist the young King <hi>Henry</hi> with all their power; and thereupon all in one day, the <hi>French</hi> invade <hi>Normandy, Aquitaine</hi> and <hi>Britaine</hi>; the King of <hi>Scots Northumberland</hi>; and King <hi>Lewis</hi> the City of <hi>Vernoill,</hi> which he brought to that distresse, that it was agreed by the Inhabitants, if it were not succoured within three dayes, then to surrender it. King <hi>Henry</hi> hearing of this agreement, promiseth to succour them by that day. But here King <hi>Lewis</hi> useth a trick, gets that by fraud, which he could not doe by force; for he sends to King <hi>Henry,</hi> that if he were willing to have peace with his sonnes, he should meet him at a place appointed, at such a time, and he doubted not to effect it. King <hi>Henry</hi> glad of such an offer, and with that gladnesse perhaps blinded, and not suspecting any deceit, promiseth to meete; and comming to the place at the day, which was the day he should have succoured <hi>Vernoill,</hi> he stayed there all day looking for King <hi>Lewis</hi> comming; who instead of comming, sent word to <hi>Vernoill,</hi> that King <hi>Henry</hi> was defeated; and therefore their hope of succour was in vaine: whereupon the Citizens thinking it to be so indeed, because he came not according to his promise, surrendred the Towne: which King <hi>Lewis</hi> finding himselfe unable to hold, set it on fire, and so departed. But King <hi>Henry</hi> when he perceived the fraud, followed him with his Army, and tooke a bloody revenge of his fraud, with the slaughter of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his men.

These things done, the King with his sonnes returnes into <hi>England,</hi> where with all joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse they were received.

suffer to be performed; fals into his old fit of discontentment: wherein though he cannot perhaps be justified, yet he may justly be excused, for to be kept from a wife at that time of his age, for which a wife was most proper; and especially having beene affianced so long before, which could not chuse but make his appetite the sharper: must needs be, if not a just cause, at least a strong provocation to make him doe as he did: Howsoever, from this fit of discontentment, he fals into a relaps of Rebellion, and infecting with it his brother <hi>Iohn,</hi> and a great part of his Fathers Adherents; they all take part with <hi>Philip</hi> (now after the decease of <hi>Lewis</hi>) King of <hi>France,</hi> who willing to make use of their assistance, before the streame of filiall awfulnesse should returne into the naturall Channell, takes them along with him, and besiegeth the City of <hi>Ments,</hi> in which King <hi>Henry</hi> at that time was himselfe in person; who apprehending the danger, and then resenting the mischiefe of falling into his enemies hands, gets him secretly out of the City, leaving it to defend it selfe, till he should returne with greater forces: but hearing afterward that the Towne was taken, he fell into so great a distraction of minde, that it made him break out into these blasphemous words; I shall never hereafter love God any more, that hath suffered a City so deare unto me, to be taken from me: but he quickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected himselfe, and repented him that he had spoken the words. Indeed <hi>Ments</hi> was the City in which he was borne, that to have this City taken from him, was as much as to have his Birth-right taken from him; and to say the truth, after he had lost this City, he scarce seemed to be alive; not onely because he shortly after died, but because the state of Majesty which had all his life accompanied him, after this forsooke him: for now he was faine to begge peace of his enemies, who often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had begged it of him: now he was glad to yeeld to conditions, which no force before could have wrested from him. It is memorable and worth observing, that when these two Kings had meeting betweene <hi>Turwyn</hi> and <hi>Arras,</hi> for recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilement of differences; there suddenly happened a Thunderbolt to light just be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, with so terrible a cracke, that it forced them for that time to breake off their conference: and afterward at another meeting, the like accident of Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der happened againe, which so amazed King <hi>Henry,</hi> that he had fallen off his horse, if he had not beene supported by those about him; which could be nothing but drops let fall of the Divine anger, and manifest presages of his future dysasters. And thus this great Princes troubles, which beganne in little ones, and were conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in great ones, ended at last in so great a trouble, that it ended his life, and left him an example of desolation, notwithstanding all his greatnesse; forsaken of his friends, forsaken of his wife, forsaken of his children; and (if he were not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe when he blasphemed for the losse of <hi>Ments</hi>) forsaken of himselfe; which might be exemplar in this King, if it were not the common Epilogue of all great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>

               <p>THis Kings Raigne is famous for the contention of a Subject with the Prince, and though it may be thought no equall match, yet in this Example we shall find it hard to judge which of them had the victory. But before we come to speak
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:52616:45"/>
of the Contention, it is fit to say something of the Man, and of the Quarrell. The man was <hi>Thomas Becket,</hi> borne in <hi>London,</hi> his Father, one <hi>Gilbert Becket,</hi> his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an outlandish Woman, of the Country of <hi>Syria.</hi> His first rising was under <hi>Theobald</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who taking a liking to him, (as one saith, no man knew for what) made him first Arch-deacon of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and then used meanes to have him be the Princes Tutor, after that to be Chancellour of <hi>England,</hi> and after the decease of the said <hi>Theobald,</hi> was himselfe made Arch-bishop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi> in his place. One memorable thing he did at his comming to be Arch-bishop, he surrendred his place of being Chancellour, as not thinking it fit to sit at the Helme of the Common-wealth, and of the Church, both at once. But now began the Contention betweene the King and him: the difference was, the King would have it ordained that Clergy men who were malefactors, should be tryed before the Secular Magistrate as Lay men were: This <hi>Becket</hi> opposed, saying, it was against the liberty of the Church, and therefore against the honour of God. Many Bishops stood with the King, some few with <hi>Becket</hi> the Contention grew long, and with the length still hotter, till at last <hi>Becket</hi> was content to assent to the Ordinance with this clause, <hi>Salvo Ordine suo</hi>: the King liked not the Clause, as being a deluding of the Ordinance: He required an absolute assent, without any clause of Reservation. At last, after many debatings and demurres, the Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop yeelds to this also, and subscribes the Ordinance, and sets his hand unto it. But going homewards, it is said, his Crosse-bearer and some other about him, bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him for that he had done, but whether moved with their words, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise upon second thoughts, the next day when they met againe, he openly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented his former deed, retracts his subscription, and sends to the Pope for ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of his fault: which the Pope not onely granted, but encouraged him to persist in the course he had begunne. It may be thought a Fable, yet is related by divers good Authours, that one time during this Contention, certaine fellows cut off the Arch-bishops horses taile; after which fact, all their Children were borne with tailes like horses; and that this continued long in their Posterity, though now long since ceased, and perhaps their Families too. But King <hi>Henry</hi> finding there was no prevailing with <hi>Becket</hi> by faire meanes, beginnes to deale more roughly with him, and first makes use of Authority upon his Temporalties; and withall a censure was spoken of to be intended against his person; which <hi>Becket</hi> understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, thought it his best course to flee the Realme, and thereupon passing under the name of <hi>Dereman,</hi> he passeth over Sea, and there, two yeares by the Pope, and five by the King of <hi>France,</hi> was maintained as it were of Almes: in which misery, nothing vexed him so much, as that King <hi>Henry</hi> sent all his kindred, Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, old and young into Banishment after him. And now King <hi>Henry</hi> finding that <hi>Becket</hi> stood much upon his Legatine Power, sent messengers to the Pope, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring him to take that power from him, and to conferre it upon his Arch-bishop of <hi>Yorke,</hi> but the Pope answered, he would not doe so, but was content the King himselfe should be his Legate, and sent him Letters to that purpose, which King <hi>Henry</hi> tooke in such scorne, that he threw away the Letters, and sent them present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly backe to him againe.</p>
               <p>In this meane time, the King of <hi>France</hi> prevailed with King <hi>Henry</hi> to afford <hi>Becket</hi> a conference, hoping to bring them to some Agreement, where being to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, King <hi>Henry</hi> alledged before the King of <hi>France,</hi> that he required nothing of <hi>Becket,</hi> but his assent to an Ordinance, to which in his Grandfather King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> the first time, all the Bishops of the Realme, and the Arch-bishop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> that then was did give their Assent; yet this moved not <hi>Becket</hi> at all, but he continued his former Tenet, it was against the honour of God, and therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to be excused. See now (saith King <hi>Henry</hi>) the perversenesse of this man, all that agrees not with his owne humour, is presently against the honour of God. While these things were thus a working, <hi>Becket</hi> had gotten him more friends at <hi>Rome,</hi> and by their meanes prevailed with the Pope, to give him power to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict some Bishops in <hi>England</hi> that had done him wrong, and the Pope spared no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

to threaten Excommunication to King <hi>Henry</hi> himselfe, if he restored not <hi>Becket</hi> to his Dignity. But whether awed with his threatning, or wonne by the King of <hi>Frances</hi> importunity, or else perhaps relenting in himselfe, he was contented at last that <hi>Becket</hi> should returne home, and enjoy his Bishopricke; who being come to <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Bishops whom he had indicted, for Crowning the young King <hi>Henry,</hi> (which he said, was his right to have done) made humble suite unto him, to be released of the censure. Which, when the Arch-bishop would not grant, but with certaine cautions and exceptions, the Bishops discontented went over to the King, complaining of the hard measure that was offered them by the Arch-bishop: whereat the King being much moved, Shall I never (saith he) be at quiet for this Priest? If I had any about me that loved me, they would find some way or other to ridde me of this trouble. Whereupon foure knights standing by that heard the King make this complaint, namely <hi>Reynold Fits-urse,</hi> or <hi>Bereson, Hugh Morvyll, William Tracy,</hi> and <hi>Richard Britton,</hi> thinking they should doe an accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble service to the King, went shortly after into <hi>England,</hi> and going to <hi>Canterbury,</hi> found the Arch-bishop then at Church, when upon the steps there, they strucke him upon the head with their swords and slew him the thirtieth day of <hi>December,</hi> in the yeare 1172. Afterward, with much adoe, by King <hi>Henries</hi> meanes they were pardoned by the Pope, onely enjoyned Penance, to goe on P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

You have heard his persecution, and (as some would have it called) his Martyrdome: now heare the honours that have beene done him, and the visitations to his Tombe. And first King <hi>Henry</hi> himselfe comming to <hi>Canterbury,</hi> as soone as he came within sight of <hi>Beckets</hi> Church, lighting off his horse, and putting off his hose and shooes he went barefoot to his Tombe, and for a further penance suffered himselfe to be beaten with rods, by every Monke of the Cloyster. A few yeares after, King <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>France</hi> comes into <hi>England</hi> of purpose to visite the Shrine of Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> where having paid his Vowes, he makes Oblations with many rich Presents. The like many Princes since that time have done; and many Miracles are reported to have beene done at his Tombe, which yet may be unbeleeved without unbeliefe, and with Faith enough. Another difference in this Kings dayes, was betweene the two Arch-bishops of <hi>England,</hi> about the jurisdiction of <hi>Canterbury</hi> over <hi>Yorke,</hi> which being referred to the Pope, he gave judgement on <hi>Canterburies</hi> side. Also in this Kings dayes there was a Schisme in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> two Popes up at once, of whom <hi>Alexander</hi> the third was one; which Schisme continued the space of almost twenty yeares. Also in this Kings dayes, one <hi>Nicholas Breakespeare,</hi> borne at Saint <hi>Albans,</hi> or as others write, at <hi>Langley</hi> in <hi>Hartfordshire,</hi> being a bondman of that Abbey, and therefore not allowed to be a Monke there, went beyond Sea, where he so profited in Learning, that the Pope made him first Bishop of <hi>Alba,</hi> and afterward Cardinall, and sent Legate to the <hi>Norwayes,</hi> where he reduced that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Paganisme to Christianity, and returning backe to <hi>Rome,</hi> was chosen Pope, by the Name of <hi>Adrian</hi> the fourth, and dyed being choaked with a Fly in his drinke.

But (saith the King) if I should be absent out of my kingdome, my own Sonnes would be ready to rise up against me in my absence; to which the Patriarch replyed, No marvaile, for from the Devill they came, and to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill they shall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

his breaking presently into bitter teares upon the seeing it, was a good signe of Repentance.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">K</seg>ING <hi>Richard,</hi> the first of that name, after his Fathers Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, went to <hi>Roan,</hi> where he setled the state of that Province; and from thence came into <hi>England,</hi> where he was Crowned King at <hi>Westminster,</hi> by the hands of <hi>Baldwin</hi> Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the third day of <hi>September,</hi> in the yeare 1189. And herein this Prince is more beholding to Writers then any of his Predecessors: for in speaking of their Crowning, they content themselves with telling where, and by whom they were Crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: but of this Prince, they deliver the manner of his Crowning, in the full am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plitude of all circumstances; which perhaps is not unfit to doe, for satisfaction of such as are never like to see a Coronation; and it was in this manner. First, the Arch-bishops of <hi>Canterbury, Roan, Tryer,</hi> and <hi>Dublin,</hi> with all the other Bishops, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots, and Cleargy, apparelled in rich Copes, and having the Crosse, holy Water, and Censers carried before them; came to fetch him at the doore of his Privie-Chamber; and there receiving him, they led him to the Church of <hi>Westminster,</hi> till they came before the high Altar, with a solemne Procession. In the middle of the Bishops and Clergy, went foure Barons, bearing Candlesticks with Tapers; after whom came <hi>Geoffrey de Lucie,</hi> bearing the Cap of Maintenance, and <hi>Iohn Marshall</hi> next to him, bearing a massive paire of Spurres of Gold; then followed <hi>William Marshall</hi> Earle of <hi>Striguill, alias Pembroke,</hi> who bare the Royall Scepter, in the toppe whereof was set a Crosse of Gold; and <hi>William de Patricke</hi> Earle of <hi>Salisbury</hi> going next him, bare the Warder or Rodde, having on the toppe thereof a Dove. Then came three other Earles, <hi>David,</hi> brother to the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Huntington, Iohn</hi> the Kings brother, Earle of <hi>Mortaigne,</hi> and <hi>Robert</hi> Earle of <hi>Leycester,</hi> each of them bearing a Sword upright in his hand, with the scabberds righly adorned with Gold. The Earle of <hi>Mortaigne</hi> went in the midst betwixt the other two; after them followed sixe Earles and Barons, bearing a Checker Table, upon the which were set the Kings Scotchens of Armes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:52616:49"/>
of the Clergy and the people, laying his hand upon the holy Evangelists, and the reliques of certaine Saints, he took a solemne Oath that he should observe peace, honour and reverence to Almighty God, to his Church, and to his Ministers, all the dayes of his life: also that he should exercise upright justice to the people com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his charge, and that he should abrogate and disanull all evill Lawes and wrongfull customes, if any were to be found in the precinct of his Realme; and maintaine those that were good and laudable. This done, he put off all his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from his middle upwards, but onely his shirt, which was open on the shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rs, that he might be annoynted. Then the Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> annoynted him in three places; on the head, on the shoulders, and on the right arme; with Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in such case accustomed. After this, he covered his head with a linnen cloath hallowed, and set his Cap thereon; and then after he had put on his Royall Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and his uppermost Robe, the Arch-bishop delivered him the Sword, with which he should beate downe the enemies of the Church: which done, two Earles put his Shooes upon his feete, and having his Mantle put on him, the Arch-bishop forbad him on the behalfe of Almighty God, not to presume to take upon him this Dignity, except he faithfully meant to performe those things which he had there sworne to performe; whereunto the King made answer, that by Gods grace he would p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rforme them. Then the King tooke the Crowne beside the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, and delivered it to the Arch-bishop, which he set upon the Kings head, delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to him the Scepter to hold in his right hand, and the Rod Royall in his left hand: and thus being Crowned, he was brought backe by the Bishops and Barons, with the Crosse and Candlesticks, and three Swords, passing forth before him unto his Seate. When the Bishop that sang the Masse, came to the Offertory, the two Bishops that brought him to the Church, led him to the Altar, and brought him backe againe. The Masse ended, he was brought with solemne Procession into his Chamber: and this was the manner of this Kings Coronation. But at this solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity there fell out a very dysastrous accident: For this Prince not favouring the <hi>Iewes,</hi> as his Father had done; had given a strict charge, that no <hi>Iew</hi> should be admitted to be a spectator of the solemnity: yet certaine <hi>Iewes,</hi> as though it had beene the Crowning of their King <hi>Herod,</hi> would needs be pressing in; and being put backe by Officers set of purpose, it grew to a brabble, and from words to blowes, so as many <hi>Ie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>es</hi> were hurt, and some slaine: and thereupon a rumour was suddenly spread abroad, that the King had commanded to have all the <hi>Iewes</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed. Whereupon it is incredible what rifling there was of <hi>Iewes</hi> houses, and what cutting of their throats: and though the King signified by publike Declaration, that he was highly displeased with that which was done, yet there was no staying the fury of the multitude till the next day; so often it fals out, that great solemnities are waited on with great dysasters; or rather indeed, as being connaturall, they can hardly be asunder.</p>

               <head>Of his first Acts after he was Crowned.</head>
               <p>HE beganne with his Mother Queene <hi>Eleanor,</hi> whom upon her Husbands dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure, having been kept in Prison sixteen yeares; he not onely set at liberty, but set in as great authority, as if she had beene left the Regent of the kingdom. The next he gratifies, was his brother <hi>Iohn</hi>; to whom he made appeare, how much the bounty of a Brother was better then the handnesse of a Father. For he confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon him, in <hi>England,</hi> the Earledomes of <hi>Cornwall, Dorset, Somerset, Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Darby,</hi> and <hi>Leycester</hi>; and by the marriage of <hi>Isabel,</hi> daughter and heire to the Earle of <hi>Glocester,</hi> he had that Earledome also; as likewise the Castles of <hi>Marle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,</hi> and <hi>Lutgarsall,</hi> the Honours of <hi>Wallingford, Tichill,</hi> and <hi>Eye,</hi> to the value of 4000. Markes a yeare: an estate so great, as were able to put a very moderate mind into the humour of aspiring, of which Princes should have care. Concerning his affianced Lady <hi>Adela,</hi> it may be thought strange, that having desired her so infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely when he could not have her, now that he might have her, he cared not for
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:52616:49"/>
her: but the cause was knowne, and in every mans mouth; that she was now but his Fathers leavings: yet he would not send her home but very rich in Jewels, to make amends, if it might be, for the losse of her Virginity: though this was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hard on his part, when the Father had taken all the pleasure, that the sonne should afterward pay all the charges. But by this at least he made a quiet way for his marriage now concluded; and shortly after to be consummated in <hi>Sicilie</hi> with <hi>Berengaria</hi> the daughter of <hi>Garsyas</hi> King of <hi>Navarre.</hi> And now his minde is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly set upon his long intended voyage to the Holy Land, for which he thinkes not the treasure left by his Father, to be sufficient, which yet amounted to nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand pounds: but forecasting with himselfe the great charge it must needs be, to carry an Army so long a journey, he seekes to enlarge his provision of money by all the means he can devise. Not long before, <hi>Hugh Pudsey</hi> had been advanced to the Bishopricke of <hi>Durham</hi>; and now for a great summe of money he sold him the Earledome: and then said merrily amongst his Lords, Doe yee not thinke me a cunning man, that of an old Bishop can make a young Earle? From the <hi>Londoners</hi> also he drained great summes of money, and made them recompence in Franchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and Liberties, which they had not before. He made also greatsales: to the the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> he sold the Castles of <hi>Berwick</hi> and <hi>Roxborough,</hi> for ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pounds: to <hi>Godfryde Lucie,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> the Manors of <hi>Weregrave</hi> and <hi>Ments</hi>: to the Abbot of Saint <hi>Edmundsbery,</hi> the Manor of <hi>Mildhall,</hi> for one thousand Markes of silver: to the Bishop of <hi>Durham,</hi> the Manor of <hi>Sadborough</hi>; and when it was marvelled that he would part with such things, he answered, that in this case he would sell his City of <hi>London,</hi> if he could finde a Chapman. But the worst way of all was, that pretending to have lost his Signet, he made a new; and made Proclamation, that whosoever would safely enjoy what under the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Signet was granted, should come to have it confirmed by the new; whereby he raised great summes of money to himselfe, but greater of discontentment in his subjects. By these, and such like meanes he quickly furnished himselfe with money: and now it remained onely to consider, to whose care he should commit the government of the Kingdome in his absence; and after deliberation, he made choyce for the North parts, of <hi>Hugh</hi> Bishop of <hi>Durham</hi>; joyning in Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him, <hi>Hugh Baldulph,</hi> and <hi>William Brunell:</hi> and for the South parts, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points <hi>William Longshampe</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ely,</hi> and Chancellour of <hi>England,</hi> and for his greater strength, causeth the Pope to make a Legat of all <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland:</hi> and for <hi>Normandy,</hi> and <hi>Aquitaine, Robert</hi> Earle of <hi>Leycester</hi>; all men eminent for prudence and uprightnesse, and which is most of all, for loyalty: and indeed to make a man fit for such imployment, all these vertues must concurre. As for his brother <hi>Iohn,</hi> he knew very well his aspiring minde, and therefore would have tied him to live in <hi>Normandy,</hi> and not to come into <hi>England</hi> till his returne; but that their Mother Queene <hi>Eleanor</hi> interceded, and passed her word for him: and that nothing might be left unprovided for, he appointed his Nephew <hi>Arthur,</hi> the sonne of his brother <hi>Geoffrey</hi> Duke of <hi>Britaine</hi> to be his Successor, if himselfe should faile. And now, <hi>Undique convenere, vocat jam carbasus auras:</hi> every man is ready to take Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and no stay now but for a Wind; onely some say that King <hi>Richard</hi> before his departing, calling his Lords and Knights unto him, and swearing them to be true; gave to overy of them a blew riband to be knowne by; from whence the first occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Order of the Garter is thought to beginne.</p>

to <hi>Messana</hi> in <hi>Sicilie,</hi> where arrived also the King of <hi>France</hi>; and not long after, his owne Navy. In this Iland the King <hi>William</hi> now lately dead, had married <hi>Iane,</hi> King <hi>Richards</hi> sister; from whom <hi>Tancred</hi> the present King with-held her Dower: and therefore though he shewed King <hi>Richard</hi> faire coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, yet he dealt secretly with the <hi>Messanians</hi> to use all meanes to get him gone; whereupon the <hi>Messanians</hi> taking a small occasion, set suddenly upon the <hi>English,</hi> and thrust them out of their Towne: with which King <hi>Richard</hi> justly offended, who had his Campe without the Towne, prepares himselfe to revenge the affront; when <hi>Tancred</hi> sending to him, to signifie that the affront was offered without his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and much against his liking, so pacified him, that for the present he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained satisfied; but understanding afterward, that the <hi>Messanians</hi> did but waite their opportunity till the Spring, when King <hi>Richard</hi> should be going: he resenting their intention, staies <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But King <hi>Philip</hi> was not well pleased with these conditions, yet he breakes not out into open dissention, till more fuell was afterward cast upon the fire of his anger.

                  </gap>trey being taken prisoner, and intreating King <hi>Richard</hi> not to put him in bonds of Iron, King <hi>Richard</hi> gives him his word, and keeps it, but puts him in bonds of Silver. In this Iland he solemnizeth his marriage with <hi>Berengaria,</hi> and then leaving <hi>Richard de Canvile,</hi> and <hi>Robert de Turnham,</hi> his Lieutenants in <hi>Cyprus</hi>; he passeth on to <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> which City was defended by <hi>Saladine,</hi> and had beene besieged now two yeares: when the enemy seeing and fearing the encrease of the Christian forces, propounds conditions, upon which accepted, they deliver it up in <hi>August,</hi> the yeare 1192.</p>
               <p>At the taking of this Towne there fell out an accident, seeming an honour to King <hi>Richard</hi> for the present, but proving a disgrace, at least a great trouble and charge to him afterward. For <hi>Leopold</hi> Duke of <hi>Austria</hi> had first set up his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours upon the wall, which King <hi>Richard</hi> caused to be throwne downe, and his owne to be set up; but this was no place to stand a quarrelling, it came not to the reckoning till some time after. When <hi>Ptolemais</hi> was taken, <hi>Saladine</hi> fearing the Christians further proceeding, dismantles all the best Townes that were neare it: as <hi>Porphyria, Caesarea, Ascalon, Gaza</hi>; but of <hi>Ioppa</hi> King <hi>Richard</hi> takes a care, and placeth in it a Colony of Christians. For <hi>Ioppa</hi> is a City of <hi>Palestine,</hi> that was built before the Floud; and hath belonging to it a Haven of great convenience. And now the King of <hi>France,</hi> though valiant enough himselfe, yet thinking his owne great acts to be obscured by greater of King <hi>Richards</hi>; he beganne, besides his old hating him, now to envie him. For indeed emulation when it is in Vertue, makes the stronger knot of love and affection: but when it is in Glory, it makes a separation, and turnes into the passion of envie and malice; and so did it with King <hi>Philip,</hi> who pretending the aire of the Countrey did not agree with his body; but was indeed because the aire of King <hi>Richards</hi> Glory did not agree with his minde; obtained King <hi>Richards</hi> consent to returne home, swearing first solemnly, not to molest his Territories in his absence.

In this time there was a trouble at home, though not to the King, yet to the kingdome: for <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin Hood</hi> accompanied with one little <hi>Iohn,</hi> and a hundred stout fellowes more, molested all passengers upon the High-way; of whom it is said, that he was of Noble bloud, at least made Noble, no lesse then an Earle, for some deserving ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices: but having wasted his estate in riotous courses, very penury forced him to take this course; in which yet it may be said he was honestly dishonest, for he sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome hurt any man, never any woman, spared the poore, and onely made prey of the rich: till the King setting forth a Proclamation to have him apprehended, it hapned he fell sicke at a certaine Nunnery in <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> called <hi>Birckleys</hi>; and desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring there to be let bloud, was betraid, and made bleed to death.

It cannot be denyed, but that in morall circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Earle <hi>Iohn</hi> had the advantage of his Nephew <hi>Arthur</hi>; for he was a Man of yeares fit to Governe, <hi>Arthur</hi> but a Childe, not above thirteene yeares old; he a Native, at least alwayes bred up in the Kingdome, <hi>Arthur</hi> a Forrainer, and had never beene here; He well knowne both to the Nobility and the People, <hi>Arthur</hi> a stranger to both, as one they had never <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eene; and besides to these morall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, he had now added one from the Politickes, that he had gotten Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; (of more force in the practicall part then all the former) and withall a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then all these, if it be true which some write, that his Brother King <hi>Richard</hi> had assigned him his Successour after his decease. But yet knowing the Title at last would come to be tryed in a Court, where the Sword must be Judge; he imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all his endevours to get this Judge to be his friend, and by all meanes possible to strengthen himselfe with Armes; and thereupon going to <hi>Chinon</hi> and <hi>Roan,</hi> he seiseth upon the Treasure which his Brother had left in those parts, and with it, gets Friends and Souldiers, the Armour of Armes. And indeed all he could have done himselfe would have done him no good, if he had not had the helpe of able Assistants, who yet assisted him no lesse for their owne ends then for his; and these were chiefly his Mother Queene <hi>Eleanor,</hi> who knew if her Grand-sonne <hi>Arthur</hi> should be King, that then his Mother <hi>Constantia</hi> would rule all; at least during his Minority, and thereby her selfe put from the Stage of all Authority; and the Arch-bishop

               <hi>Hubert,</hi> who also knew that if <hi>Arthur</hi> should come to Raigne, that then the <hi>Anjouyn</hi> and <hi>French</hi> should have all the best Offices, and the <hi>English</hi> wholly be neglected, as it was in the time of King <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour. And yet a greater Friend then both these, for comming to <hi>Roan,</hi> he used meanes that <hi>Walter</hi> the Arch-bishop in the Cathedrall Church with great pompe girt him with the Ducall sword of <hi>Normandy,</hi> and Crowned him with a Coronet of Golden Roses, he taking his Oath for Faithfull Administration in that Dukedome, and they their Oath for being his Loyall Subjects.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Of his troubles in contestation with his Nephew Arthur.</head>
               <p>THough King <hi>Iohn</hi> had entred upon <hi>Normandy,</hi> and made that Province sure unto him, yet the Province of <hi>Anjou</hi> stood firme for <hi>Arthur,</hi> in observance of their love to his Father their former Prince: which also King <hi>Iohn</hi> soone after in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading, reduceth by Force of Armes to his Obedience. And now <hi>Constantia</hi> the Mother of Prince <hi>Arthur,</hi> finding King <hi>Iohn</hi> too powerfull an adversary, and no likelihood for her party, to be able long to stand out against him without further assistance, conceives it her best way to have recourse to the King of <hi>France,</hi> and thereupon commits her Sonne <hi>Arthur</hi> to his Tuition: who seemed to receive him with the tendernesse of a Father, and promiseth to assist him with his uttermost Forces, in the recovery of his Right both in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England.</hi> Here we may observe upon what hinge the affection of the Kings of <hi>France</hi> was used to turne. For in King <hi>Henry</hi> the seconds time, King <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>France</hi> was so great a Friend to his Sonne <hi>Richard,</hi> that by all meanes he would helpe him to get the kingdome from his Father; Afterward when <hi>Richard</hi> was King, then <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> was so great a Friend to <hi>Iohn,</hi> that by all meanes he would helpe him to get the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from his Brother; and now that <hi>Iohn</hi> is come to be King, he is presently growne so great a Friend of <hi>Arthur,</hi> that by all meanes he will helpe him to get the kingdome from his Unkle; and no doubt, if <hi>Arthur</hi> should ever have come to be King, he would have beene as ready to helpe any other to get the kingdome from him: by which it appeares, that it was not the Persons of the Men they either hated or loved, but that they were alwaies jealous of their growing too great; and indeed this ballancing of States keepes Princes affections alwayes in suspense, and never suffers the Glasse of their Love or Hate, to make a true Reflection. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this time <hi>William</hi> King of <hi>Scots</hi> came to <hi>London</hi> to visit King <hi>Iohn,</hi> and there did homage to him for his kingdome of <hi>Scotland,</hi> though some say, but onely for the Counties of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Cumberland,</hi> but being required ayde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>French,</hi> he excused himselfe, saying, he could not doe it without consent of his kingdome, and so returned home.</p>
               <p>And now <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> having undertaken the protection of the young Prince <hi>Arthur,</hi> with a mighty Army enters <hi>Normandy,</hi> takes many of the best Townes, and pursuing his Victories, enters the Province of <hi>Anjou</hi> also, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers it from King <hi>Iohn,</hi> which he the yeare before had gotten from Prince <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur.</hi> Upon this King <hi>Iohn</hi> makes a Journey into <hi>Normandy,</hi> accusing King <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> for breaking the Truce, which formerly he had made with King <hi>Richard</hi> for five yeares; but when he should come to make his Accusation good by Armes, he falleth to Treaties, and obtaineth a new Truce for fifty dayes: with which new Truce, <hi>Baldwyn</hi> Earle of <hi>Flanders,</hi> who had professed himselfe of that side, was not well pleased; and thereupon commeth to King <hi>Iohn</hi> to <hi>Roan,</hi> and entring a new League with him, they there consult how to proceed, when the fifty dayes should be expired. This consultation the King of <hi>France</hi> understood; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon both sides prepare for warre, but at the end of the Truce, both sides seemed to relent, and divers meetings were had for Treaties of Peace, and in conclusion, King <hi>Iohn</hi> more desirous of Peace then was for his Honour, agreed to these Conditions; that his Ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

her in Dower, besides thirty thousand Markes in money, all those Cities, except onely <hi>Angiers,</hi> which the <hi>French</hi> before that time had taken, which were many and very great: and his Peace thus made, he returnes into <hi>England</hi> with great joy, but was not with like joy received of the <hi>English</hi> Lords, who counted themselves dishonoured, in the dishonourable Conditions he had made; and <hi>Baldwyn</hi> Earle of <hi>Flanders</hi> also, when he saw the poore spi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But King <hi>Iohn</hi> having now gotten a Vacation, and a time of ease, which agreed much better with his nature then Warre, sets his minde wholly upon pleasures; and for maintaining his pleasures, upon seeking after profit, which he pursues by all manner of injustice, under the name of Prerogative; and with such violence, that when his Brother <hi>Geoffrey</hi> Arch-bishop of <hi>Yorke,</hi> in the dutifulnesse of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellour, advised him not to take such unlawfull courses, he most unworthily tooke from him all he had, and it was a yeares worke for all the Arch-bishops friends to pacify his anger. In the necke of this injustice, he commits another, he procures a divorce from his Wife <hi>Avis,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Robert</hi> Earle of <hi>Glocester,</hi> onely for being of kinne to him in the third degree, and by advice of the King of <hi>France,</hi> marries <hi>Isabell</hi> Daughter and Heire of the Earle of <hi>Angoulesme,</hi> Affianced before to <hi>Hugh le Brun</hi> Earle of <hi>March</hi>; and shortly after brings her with him into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> where he and she together, are both Crowned at <hi>Canterbury.</hi> And here the Earles and Barons of the Realme, being all summoned to attend the King into <hi>France</hi> at <hi>Whitsontide</hi> following; they all by a generall consent send him word, that unlesse he would restore them their Rights and Liberties, they would doe him no service out of the kingdome. But what it was that made the Lords more violent in pressing their Demands at this time then before, no Writers of these times doe sufficiently deliver: Onely some of them speake scatteringly of certaine oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (besides the generall Grievance for Exactions) lately offered to some of the Lords, one to the Earle of <hi>Chester,</hi> whom he would have banished, onely for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vising him to leave his cruelty and incontinency: Another, a pursuite in Love to a Daughter of <hi>Robert Fits-Water,</hi> called <hi>Maude</hi> the Faire, who not consenting to the Kings lust, a messenger was sent to give her poyson in a potched Egge, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of she dyed: And a third, offered to <hi>William de Brawse</hi> and his Lady, for a rash word spoken; for when the King sent to have <hi>de Brawses</hi> Sonne delivered him for a pledge, the Lady answered, We shall doe well indeed to commit our Sonne to his keeping, who kept so well his owne Nephew Prince <hi>Arthur.</hi> This rash word cost <hi>de Brawse</hi> his Country, and his Lady and their Son their lives, both of them being famished to death in Prison. For, though these directly were but particular Grievances, yet reflectingly they were generall, what one suffered all might; but whether any of these, or all of these together, were Ingredients to make a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound of violence in the Lords at this time, or whatsoever was the true cause, this was plainely the effect, that unlesse the King would restore their liberties, they would not follow him out of the kingdome. But notwithstanding this refusall of his Lords, he passeth over with his Queene into <hi>Normandy,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> where the King of <hi>France</hi> receives them with all complements of Love and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. But now <hi>Hugh</hi> Earle of <hi>March,</hi> resenting the injury done him by King <hi>Iohn</hi>; in taking away his affianced Wife, joynes with Prince <hi>Arthur,</hi> and the King of <hi>France</hi> also, for all his faire shew of amity lately made, joynes with them, as having sometime before marryed his youngest Daughter to Prince <hi>Arthur,</hi> and these with their Forces joyned, invade first the <hi>Turones,</hi> and then the <hi>Anjovins:</hi> of which Province Queene <hi>Eleanor</hi> the Kings Mother was left Regent, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon betakes her selfe to <hi>Mirabell</hi> the strongest Towne of those parts, and sends to her Sonne King <hi>Iohn,</hi> acquainting him with the danger she was in, aud requiring his speedy succour.

But <hi>Philip,</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to leave the <hi>English</hi> nothing on that side the Sea, invadeth <hi>Chinon,</hi> and takes it; and in it the valiant Captaine <hi>Roger Lacie,</hi> which had given a period to King <hi>Philips</hi> victories, had not <hi>Guido</hi> the husband of <hi>Constantia</hi> Prince <hi>Arthurs</hi> Mother revolted to King <hi>Iohn</hi>; who with his assistance once againe leavies an Army, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siegeth Mount <hi>Auban,</hi> a Castle thought impregnable, and within fifteene dayes takes it, which <hi>Charles</hi> the Great could not get with his seven yeares siege: where so great a number of <hi>French</hi> Lords were taken prisoners, that King <hi>Iohn</hi> sent a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of their names into <hi>England,</hi> for a memoriall of so great a victory. After this, he taketh the strong Towne of <hi>Angiers,</hi> and utterly defaceth it; for which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward he was sorry, as being the Towne where he was borne.

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:52616:56"/>
whereof a Charter was produced, that had beene formerly granted in King <hi>Henry</hi> the firsts time: whereupon comming to the King after <hi>Christmas,</hi> lying then in the New Temple, and acquainting him with their Demands; he gives them this faire Answer, that within a few dayes he would give them satisfaction; and causeth the Bishops of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>Ely,</hi> with <hi>William Marshall,</hi> Earle of <hi>Glocester,</hi> to passe their words for him, that it should be performed. But the King meaning nothing lesse then to doe as he said, fals presently a leavying of Souldiers; which the Lords understanding, they also doe the like; and going to the Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver him a Copy of their Demands, and require the Kings Answer. But the Bishop shewing it to the King, and humbly intreating him to give the Lords a satisfactory Answer: he swore a great Oath, they might as well demand the Kingdome, and that he would die before he would yeeld to any such demands. Whereupon the Lords (knowing now what they were to trust to) fall to besiege <hi>Northampton,</hi> and after that, <hi>Redford,</hi> which is yeelded to them; and withall they are sent to by the <hi>Londoners,</hi> to signifie their readinesse to joyne with them. At this time the King was at <hi>Windsor</hi> providing an Army, but hearing the <hi>Londoners</hi> were joyned with the Lords, he thought it no good way to proceed by force, but rather by fraud; and thereupon sends to the Lords, that if they would come to him to <hi>Windsor,</hi> he would grant their demands. The Lords comming thither, but in a Military manner, (for they durst not trust his word) the King saluted them all kindly, and promised to give them satisfaction in all they demanded; and so in a Meadow betweene <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor</hi> and <hi>Stanes,</hi> called <hi>Running-meade,</hi> he freely consented to confirme their former Liberties; and was content some grave Personages should be chosen to see it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. But the next day, when it should be done, he gets him gone to <hi>South-ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pton,</hi> and from thence to the Ile of <hi>Wight</hi>; where advising with his Councell, what in this case was fittest to be done: It was concluded he should send to the Pope, to acquaint him with this mutiny of the Lords, and to require his help: while the King in the meane time lived skulking up and downe in corners, that no man might know where to find him; or which is worse (as some write) roving about and practising Piracy. And now the Lords beginne to suspect fraud, when shortly after the Kings Messengers, who were <hi>Walter</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> Bishops of <hi>Worcester</hi> and <hi>Norwich,</hi> returne with the Popes Decree; which was, that the Kings Grant to the Lords should be void: with this Decree, the King after three moneths that he had staied in the Ile of <hi>Wight,</hi> comming backe to <hi>Windsor,</hi> acquaints the Lords; but they accusing the Messengers for false informing the Pope, and the Pope also for making a Decree without hearing both sides, betake them to Armes, and sweare by the holy Altar to be revenged for this Iudification and injurious dealing. The King finding the Lords nothing moved with the Popes Decree, sends againe unto him, to acquaint him with it: who mightily incensed to have his Decree so sleighted, adjudgeth them all to be held as enemies of Religion; and gives power to <hi>Peter</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> and to the Abbot of <hi>Reading</hi> to Excommunicate them. In the meane time the King had sent the Bishop of <hi>Worcester,</hi> Chancellour of <hi>England,</hi> and others with his Seale, to hire Souldiers from the parts beyond the Seas; who returned shortly after, bringing along with him out of <hi>Poicto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>IT was now the tenth yeare of King <hi>Henries</hi> Raigne, and being about nineteene yeares of age, he claimed to take the government of the kingdome into his own hands, and no longer to be under a Protectour; and now will presently appeare the difference betweene a Prince that is ruled by good Counsell, and a Prince that will doe all of himselfe, and take no advise. For the ten yeares hee was ruled by a Protectour, were all passed, as it were in a calme, without noyse or clamour; but as soone as he tooke upon him the government himselfe, there grew presently stormes and tumults; no quietnesse either to the subject or himselfe: nothing but grievances all the long time of his Raigne. For at the Parliament now holden at <hi>Oxford,</hi> as soone as he was Crowned againe, he presently cancels and annuls the Charter of the Forests, as granted in his Nonage; and therefore he not bound to observe it: and then not using any longer the Seale which the Protectour had used, he makes a new; and causeth a Proclamation to be made, that whosoever would enjoy any benefit of Grants under his Seale, should come and have them signed by his new Seale; by which course he drew much mony from many: and this was

At last a Frier is imployed to perswade the Earle Marshall to submit himselfe to the King, but all in vaine; till at length a traine is laid to draw him over into <hi>Ireland,</hi> to defend his state there, being seised upon by the King; where by treachery circumvented he lost his life. Yet the King disavowes the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of any such Commission into <hi>Ireland,</hi> protesting he never knew thereof; and laies the fault upon his Officers: an easie way for Princes, never to be found in any fault.</p>
               <p>After two yeares affliction, a Parliament is assembled at <hi>VVestminster,</hi> wherein the Bishops admonish the King by his Fathers example, to be at unity with his people, and to remove from him strangers, and to governe the kingdome by Natives of the Realme; and by the Lawes: otherwise they would proceed by Ecclesiasticall censure, both against his Counsellours and himselfe.

               <p>And now is the Kings turne to play his part, in using his authority, which he failes not to doe to the uttermost: for upon a small-occasion he causeth the gates of <hi>Gilbert</hi> now Earle of <hi>Pembroke</hi> (the third sonne of <hi>VVilliam</hi> the great Marshall) to be shut against him at <hi>VVinchester,</hi> whereupon the Earle retires into the North.

of the Popes warre against the Emperour: which though the Clergy opposed, and shewed many good reasons of their opposition both to the King and the Legat, yet by promises or threatnings, they were won or forced to yeeld unto it. And now comes the Earle of <hi>March,</hi> and once againe solicits the King to make another jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney into <hi>France,</hi> which being yeelded to by the King, and assented to in Parliament, an aide presently was demanded towards it: but this demand was not onely oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, but all the Kings Taxations and aides before granted, were now repeated; and thereupon an absolute deniall to grant any more. Upon this, the King comes to the Parliament himselfe in person; earnestly, and indeed, humbly craving their aide for this once: but all prevailed not, they had made a vow to the contrary: and the King is driven to get what he could of particular men, of whom partly by gift, and partly by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This expedition had no better successe then the former, for after a whole yeares stay, the King was driven to make a dishonourable Truce with the King of <hi>France,</hi> and returne home. At his returne he puts the <hi>Iewes</hi> to another redemption, and the <hi>Londoners</hi> to another exaction; and to helpe on his charge, his wives mother, the Countesse of <hi>Provence</hi> comes now to visit him; who bringing her daughter <hi>Zanchia</hi> with her, a marriage is solemnised betweene her and <hi>Richard</hi> Earle of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> whose wife was lately dead, and he returned from the Holy warres.

to inquire of all such Lands as had beene inforested, and either to fine the occupy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers thereof at their pleasure, or else to take it from them and sell the same to others; wherein such rigour was used, that multitudes of people were undone. But now to shew the King the estate of his kingdome, and the oppressions of Popes, inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was made of the Revenues which the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Italians</hi> had in <hi>England:</hi> which were found to be annually sixty thousand Markes; being more then the yearely Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues of the Crowne: which so moved the King that he caused the same to be notifyed, with all other Exactions, to the Generall Councell now Assembled at <hi>Lyons</hi>; and this (with the ill usage of his Agent <hi>Martin</hi>) so vexed the Pope, that he is said to have uttered these words: It is time to make an end with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, that we may crush these petty Kings, for the Dragon once appeased or destroyed, these lesser Snakes will soone be trodden downe.

But the Parliament not supplying him, he is advised to furnish his wants with sale of his Plate, and Jewels of the Crowne, being told, that though they were sold, yet they would revert againe unto him; and having with great losse received money for them, he askes who had bought them: Answer is made, the City of <hi>London.</hi> That City (said he) is an inexhaustible Gulph: If <hi>Octavius</hi> Treasure were to be sold, they surely would buy it.</p>
               <p>And now to vexe them, he appoints a Faire to be kept at <hi>Westminster,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding under great penalty, all exercise of Merchandise within <hi>London,</hi> for fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene dayes, and all other Fayres in <hi>England,</hi> and namely that of <hi>Ely:</hi> but this Novelty came to nothing; the Inconvenience of the place, as it was then, and the foulenesse of the weather, brought more affliction then benefit to the Traders. That <hi>Christmas</hi> also he requires Newyeares gifts of the <hi>Londoners,</hi> and shortly after writes unto them his Letters imperiously deprecatory to ayde him with money, and thereby gets of them twenty thousand pounds, for which the next yeare after he craves pardon of them. And notwithstanding his continuall taking up all Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions for his House, yet he lessens his House-keeping in no honourable manner. And then seeing he could get nothing of the States together, he calls unto him, or writes to every Nobleman apart, declaring his poverty; and how he was bound by Charter in a debt of thirty thousand pound to those of <hi>Burdeaux</hi> and his <hi>Gas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coynes,</hi>

The Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot of Saint <hi>Albons</hi> yet was more kind, and gave him threescore Markes. To such lownesse did the necessity of this indigent King (through his profusion) bring him.

               <p>But now the Lords assemble againe at <hi>London,</hi> and presse him with his promise made unto them, that the Chiefe Justiciar, Chancellour and Treasurer, should be appointed by the Generall Councell of the kingdome, but by the absence of <hi>Richard</hi> Earle of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> (which was thought to be done of purpose) they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne frustrate of their desire. And now the Bishopricke of <hi>Winchester</hi> falling void, the King sends presently to the Monkes of the Cathedrall Church; to Elect his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Athelmar</hi>; and because he would not be denyed, he goes thither himselfe in person, and there enters the Chapter house as a Bishop or Prior, gets up into the Presidents Chaire, beginnes a Sermon, and takes his Text, <hi>Iustice and Peace have kissed each other</hi>; and thereupon useth these words: To me and other Kings who are to governe the people, belongs the rigour of Judgement and Justice; to you who are men of quiet and Religion, Peace and Tranquillity; and this day I heare you have (for your owne good) beene favourable to my request; with many such like words: whereby the Monkes finding the earnestnesse of his desire, held it in vaine to deny him, and <hi>Athelmar</hi> is Elected; but with this reservation, if the Pope allow it.

But afterward by intercession of the Earle of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> and the Bishop of <hi>London;</hi> the King becomes pacifyed, and Sir <hi>Henry</hi> is released, paying two thousand Markes; and after is restored to his former place and favour.

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:52616:64"/>
Bishops of <hi>Worcester</hi> and <hi>Chichester</hi> to declare his Intentions, and to exhort the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to undertake the Crosse and attend him: but few are moved by their perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, onely three knights of small note, whom thereupon the King in open view, imbraceth, kisseth, and cals his Brethren; checking the <hi>Londoners</hi> as ignoble Mercenaries: and there himselfe takes his Oath for performing it, and to set forth upon <hi>Midsummer</hi> day next. In taking his Oath, he layes his right hand on his Breast, according to the manner of a Priest; and after on the Booke, and kist it as a Layman. About this Tenth (granted by the Pope, but not by the People) a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament is called at <hi>London,</hi> where the Bishops are first dealt withall, (as being a worke of Piety) and they absolutely refuse it; then the Temporall Lords are set upon, and they answer as the Bishops: which put the King into so great a rage, that he drove out all that were in his Chamber, as he had beene madde. Then he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop replies, Disswading him from the Journey by the Example of the King of <hi>France</hi>; and to that purpose useth many good reasons; which the King hearing, in great passion commanded his servants to thrust him out of doore, perceiving by this what was to be expected of the rest; and thereupon fals upon his former vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent courses; and first the City of <hi>London</hi> is compelled to the Contribution of a thousand Markes: and the <hi>Gascoyners</hi> being upon revolt, unlesse speedy succour be sent them; generall Musters are made, and commandement given, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever could dispend thirteene pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> should furnish out a Horseman. This occasions another Parliament, wherein it seemes, the State beganne wisely to consider that all their oppositions did no good, the Kings turne must be served one way or other; therefore they agreed to relieve him rather by the usuall way, then force him to those extravagant courses which he tooke; but yet so, as the Reformation of the Government, and the ratification of their Lawes and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, might once againe be solemnely confirmed. And after fifteene dayes consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, to satisfie the Kings desire for his holy Expedition, a Tenth is granted by the Clergy, and Scutage, three Markes of every knights Fee by the Laity; and thereupon those often confirmed Charters are againe ratifyed, and that in the most solemne and Ceremoniall manner, that State and Religion could possibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise. The King with all the Great Nobility of <hi>England,</hi> all the Bishops in their reverent Ornaments with burning Candles in their hands, assemble to heare the terrible sentence of Excommunication against the infringers of the same. And at the lighting of those Candles the King having received one in his hand, gives it to a Prelate that stood by, saying: It becomes not me, being no Priest, to hold this Candle, my heart shall be a greater Testimony; and withall laid his hand spread upon his Breast all the time the sentence was read; which was thus Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, <hi>Authoritate Dei Omnipotentis, &amp;c.</hi> Which done, he caused the Charter of King <hi>Iohn</hi> his Father, granted by his free consent, to be openly read. In the end, having throwne away their Candles, which lay smoaking on the ground, they cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, So let them who incurre this sentence be extinct, and have no better sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour then these snuffes: and the King with a loud voyce said, As God helpe me, I will, as I am a Man, a Christian, a Knight, a King Crowned and annoynted, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violably observe all these things: and therewithall the Bels rung out, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple shouted for Joy.</p>

many away from the party of the Barons, amongst whom was <hi>Henry</hi> sonne to the Earle of <hi>Cornwall, Roger Clifford, Roger de Leisbourne, Haimo Lestrange,</hi> and many others. But the Earle of <hi>Leycester,</hi> notwithstanding this revolt, recovers the Town and Castle of <hi>Glocester</hi>; constraines the Citizens to pay a thousand pounds for their redemption; goes with an Army to <hi>Worcester,</hi> possesseth him of the Castle, thence to <hi>Shrewsbery,</hi> and so comes about to the Ile of <hi>Ely,</hi> subdues the same, and growes exceeding powerfull. The King doubting his approach to <hi>London,</hi> fals to treat of a Peace, and a Peace is concluded upon these conditions; that all the Castles of the King should be delivered to the keeping of the Barons; the Provisions of <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> should inviolably be kept; all strangers by a certaine time should avoid the kingdome, except onely such as were licensed to stay. The Prince had fortified <hi>Windsor</hi> Castle; but <hi>Leycester</hi> comming to besiege it, he treats with him for Peace, which is refused, and the Castle is rendred to him.</p>
               <p>The King at this time, to win time, convokes another Parliament at <hi>London,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he won many Lords to take his part; as namely the Prince <hi>Richard</hi> his brother, <hi>Henry</hi> his son, <hi>William Valence,</hi> with the rest of his brothers lately returned, and with them the King marcheth to <hi>Oxford,</hi> whither divers Lords of <hi>Scotland</hi> repaire to him; as <hi>Iohn Commin, Iohn Baylioll,</hi> Lords of <hi>Galloway, Robert Bruce,</hi> and others: also many Barons of the North; <hi>Glifford, Percey, Basset,</hi> and others. From <hi>Oxford</hi> he goes to <hi>Northampton,</hi> where he tooke prisoners, <hi>Simon Montford</hi> the younger, with foureteene other principall men; thence to <hi>Nottingham,</hi> making spoyles of such possessions as pertained to the Barons in those parts. And now the Kings side growes strong, which the Earles of <hi>Leycester</hi> and <hi>Glocester</hi> seeing, they write to the King, protesting their loyalty, and how they opposed onely such as were enemies to him and the kingdome, and had belied them. The King returnes answer, that themselves were the perturbers of him and his State, and sought his and the kingdomes destruction; and therefore defies them. The Prince likewise and the Earle of <hi>Cornwall</hi> send letters of defiance to them. Yet the Barons continue to mediate a Peace, and send the Bishops of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Worcester,</hi> with offer of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thousand Markes to the King, for the dammages done in these warres, so as the Statutes of <hi>Oxford</hi> may be observed; but this offer is not accepted. The Earle seeing no remedy, but it must be put to a day; takes his time to be earlier ready then was expected, and supplies his want of strength with policie, placing on the one side of a hill neare <hi>Lewis,</hi> where the battell was fought, certaine Ensignes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out men, in such sort, as they might seeme a farre off, to be Squadrons of succours to second those he brought to the encounter, whom he caused all to weare white Crosses, both for their owne notice, and the signification of his cause, which he would have to be thought for justice. Here the fortune of the day was his, the King, the Prince, the Earle of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> and his sonne <hi>Henry,</hi> the Earles of <hi>Arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell</hi> and <hi>Hereford,</hi> with all the Scottish Lords, are taken prisoners; the Eale <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, William de Valence, Guy de Lusignan,</hi> the Kings brothers, with <hi>Hugh Bigod</hi> Earle Marshall, save themselves by flight: five thousand (some say twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand) others are slaine in the battell. A yeare and a halfe is <hi>Simon Montford</hi> in pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of his prisoners, carrying the King about with him to countenance his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, till he had gotten all the strongest Castles in the kingdome.</p>

And thus ended <hi>Montford</hi> the great Earle of <hi>Leycester,</hi> highly honoured in his life, and more highly should have beene after his death, if the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might have had their will, who talkt of Miracles enough to have made him a Saint.</p>
               <p>And now is King <hi>Henry</hi> by this victory of his sonne, at liberty; who together repaire to <hi>Winchester,</hi> where a Parliament is convoked, and all who adhered to the Earle <hi>Montford</hi> are disinherited, and their estates conferred on others, at the Kings pleasure; the <hi>Londoners</hi> also have their Liberties taken from them. But though the death of <hi>Montford</hi> gave a great wound to the party of the Barons, yet it was not mortall, at least not mortal presently, for there remained reliques that kept it alive a good while after. <hi>Simon</hi> and <hi>Guy de Montford,</hi> sons of the Earle of <hi>Leycester,</hi> and other of the Barons, take and defend the Ile of <hi>Ely:</hi> the Castle of <hi>Killingworth</hi> held out halfe a yeare, till their victuals failed; and then yeelded upon conditions to have their lives and goods saved: and many others there were, resolute and desperate persons, strongly knit and fastned together, though now shortly upon dissolving. For after the Parliament at <hi>Westminster,</hi> the King with an Army going against them, and being at <hi>Northampton, Simon</hi> and <hi>Guy de Montford</hi> submit themselves to him: but when the Earle of <hi>Glocester</hi> opposed the restoring them to their estates, they were faine to flie the kingdome, and make their fortunes in other Countries, as indeed they did; the younger in <hi>Italy,</hi> the elder in <hi>France,</hi> where they were Propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours of two great Families. Their mother was banisht shortly after the battell of <hi>Evesham,</hi> a Lady of eminent note, as being the daughter and sister of a King; and yet of more note for her patient bearing of adversity, or rather for her making a benefit of adversity; for by this meanes she betooke her selfe to the veile of piety, and died a Nunne at <hi>Montarges</hi> in <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Three yeares after this, the disinherited Barons held out, till at length, condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of render are propounded; but here the Councell are divided in opinion: <hi>Mortimer</hi> and others stated in the possessions of the disinherited, are against re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storation; alleadging, it were injustice to take from them the rewards of their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. <hi>Glocester,</hi> and the twelve ordained to deale for the peace of the State, are ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest for restoration; alleadging, it were hard measure to grant them their lives, &amp; not their livelihoods: but not prevailing, in great discontentment <hi>Glocester</hi> retires from Court, sends messengers to warne the King to remove strangers from his counsell; and observe the Provisions at <hi>Oxford,</hi> as he promised at <hi>Evesham</hi>: otherwise that he should not marvell if himselfe did what he thought fit. Hereupon <hi>Iohn de War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren,</hi> Earle of <hi>Surrey,</hi> and <hi>William de Valentia</hi> are sent to the Earle of <hi>Glocester</hi>: who though they could not perswade him to submit to the King; yet thus much they got of him under his hand and seale, that he would never beare Armes against the King or his sonne <hi>Edward,</hi> but onely defend himselfe, and pursue <hi>Roger Mortimer</hi> and his other enemies. And now a Parliament is convoked at <hi>Bury,</hi> wherein many demands are made by the King and the Legat, and all for money from the Clergy; but all denied, that nothing but denials are done in this Parliament. After this, the Legat imployes Solicitours to perswade the disinherited Lords which held the Ile of <hi>Ely,</hi> to returne to the faith and unity of the Church, and to the peace of the King, according to the forme propounded at <hi>Coventry:</hi> to which the Lords make answer, that they never opposed the unity of the Church<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hereupon the yeare after, the King prepares a mighty Army, and Prince <hi>Edward</hi> with bridges

Now remaines <hi>Lewilin</hi> and the <hi>Welsh,</hi> to be chastened for aiding of <hi>Simon Montford</hi>; but the King going against them with an Army, they give him two and thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pounds Sterling, and so make their peace. And here was an end of the first warres betweene the Kings of <hi>England</hi> and their Barons. The next yeare after the Popes Legat <hi>Ottobon</hi> signes with the Croysado both the Kings sonnes, <hi>Edward</hi> and <hi>Edmund,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Glocester,</hi> and divers Noble men induced to undertake the Holy warre, by the sollicitation of him and the King of <hi>France:</hi> who nothwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing his former calamities endured in that action, would once again adventure it: and because Prince <hi>Edward</hi> wanted meanes to furnish himselfe out, the King of <hi>France</hi> lends him thirty thousand Markes upon a morgage of <hi>Gascoyne.</hi> And now whilst this preparation is in hand, King <hi>Henry</hi> labours to establish the peace of the kingdome, and to reforme the excesses which the warre had bred; and the same yeare assembles his last Parliament at <hi>Marleborough,</hi> where the Statutes of that title were enacted.

Particularly in this Kings Raigne was made that Statute, by which the Ward and marriage of the heires of Barons within age, is given to the King. Also in this Kings Raigne the Pleas of the Crowne were pleaded in the Tower of <hi>London.</hi> All Weares in the <hi>Thames</hi> are in this Kings time ordained to be pluck'd up and destroyed. Also the Citizens of <hi>London</hi> are allowed by Charter, to passe Toll-free through all <hi>England,</hi> and to have free Warren about <hi>London,</hi> also to have and use a common Seale.

               <p>AFfaires of the Church for matter of Doctrine, were never more quiet then in this Kings Raigne; for now all Heresies accounted of the time, especially the <hi>Albigenses</hi> were in a manner suppressed by the Armes of the King of <hi>France,</hi> not without the Vote of the King of <hi>England,</hi> who forbore to make warre upon him in tendernesse to this service; but for matter of manners, they were never more turbulent: for now Abbeys were fleeced, Sanctuaries violated, Clergy-men outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, Bishops themselves not spared; and all for greedinesse of money, or for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge. <hi>Ottobone</hi> the Popes Legat here in <hi>England,</hi> lying at the Abbey of <hi>Oseney,</hi> there happened a difference betweene his servants and the Schollers of <hi>Oxford</hi>; in which contention, a brother of his was slaine, and the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Also in this Kings time the new worke of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Church in <hi>London</hi> was begunne. If it were piety in the <hi>Iew,</hi> who falling into a Privie upon a Saterday, would not be taken out that day, because it was the <hi>Iewes</hi> Sabbath: It was as much piety in the Earle of <hi>Glocester,</hi> that would not suffer him to be taken out the next day, because it was the Christian Sabbath; and when the third day he was taken out dead, whose piety was the greater? A strange acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent upon an act of piety, is related in this Kings time; which if true, is a Miracle, if not true, is yet a Legend, and not unworthy to be read: that in a time of dearth, one man in a certaine Parish, who allowed poore people to relieve themselves with taking Corne upon his ground, had at Harvest a plentifull crop; where others that denied them, had their Corne all blasted, and nothing worth. In this Kings time also, <hi>Hugh Balsamus,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ely,</hi> founded Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Colledge in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge.

For which, and other crimes laid to his charge in the Kings Bench, where the King himselfe was present; he was adjudged to have his Lands confiscate, and to be deprived of his title of Earle; yet after all this, was restored to his estate againe, and suffered to live in quiet.

               <head>Of Men of note in his time.</head>
               <p>OF Martial men famous in his time there were many, but three specially who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scured the rest: The first was <hi>William Marshall</hi> Earle of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> memorable for the great care he had of King <hi>Henry</hi> in his minority, and more memorable for the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle care, that Destiny had of his Posterity; for leaving five Sonnes behind him, they all lived to be Earles successively, yet all dyed without issue: So as the great name and numerous Family of the <hi>Marshals</hi> came wholly to be extinct in that Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The second was <hi>Richard de Clare</hi> Earle of <hi>Glocester,</hi> who in a Battaile against <hi>Baldwyn de Gisnes,</hi> a valiant <hi>Fleming,</hi> imployed by King <hi>Henry,</hi> himselfe alone en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred twelve of his Enemies, and having his Horse slaine under him, he pitcht one of them by the legge out of the saddle, and leapt into it himselfe, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued the fight without giving ground, till his Army came to rescue him. An Act that may seeme fitter to be placed amongst the Fictions of knights Errant, then in a true Narration. The third was <hi>Simon Montford,</hi> a man of so audacious a spirit, that he gave King <hi>Henry</hi> the lye to his face, and that in presence of all his Lords; and of whom it seemes, the King stood in no small feare: for passing one time up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Thames,</hi> and suddenly taken with a terrible storme of Thunder and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, he commanded to be set ashore at the next Staires, which happened to be at <hi>Durham</hi> House, where <hi>Montford</hi> then lay, who comming downe to meet the King, and perceiving him somewhat frighted with the Thunder, said unto him, Your Maj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Of men famous for Sanctity of life, there were likewise many in his time, but three more eminent then the rest, <hi>Edmund</hi> Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury, Richard</hi> Bishop of <hi>Chichester,</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi> Arch-deacon of <hi>Hereford</hi>; All three either Canonized, or at least

                  </gap> And indeed the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence had shewed a speciall care over him from his Child-hood! whereof one or two Examples will not be unfit to be related. One was this, that being yet but young, and playing one time at Chesse with a Friend, in the midst of his game, without any apparent occasion, he removed himselfe from the place where he sate, when suddenly there fell from the roofe of the house a great stone, which if he had stayed in the place but never so little had beaten out his braines. Another Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Divine Providence over him, (though it happened afterwards) was this: Having prepared a great Fleete of Ships for a journey into <hi>Flanders,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Winchelsey,</hi> where the Ships were to meete; it happened that riding about the Harbour, his Horse frighted with the noyse of a Windmill, which the wind drove violently about, skrambled up and leapt over the Mud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And under the wing of this Divine Providence, he had now passed all the dangers of his tedious Journey; and being safely come to <hi>London,</hi> was on the fifteenth day of <hi>August</hi> in the yeare 1274. Crowned at <hi>Westminster,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his Wife Queene <hi>Eleanor,</hi> by <hi>Robert Kilwarby</hi> Arch-bishop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>: where five hundred great Horses were let loose, for any that could take them; and yet the outward solemnity was not more great, then the inward joy was univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall, every man rejoycing, not onely at a change, which of it selfe is pleasing, but at a change so much for the better, as this was like to be.</p>

               <head>Of his Acts done after he was Crowned.</head>
               <p>THe Acts of this King after he was Crowned, may not unfitly be divided into five parts: His Acts with his Temporall Lords; His Acts with his Clergy; Then with <hi>Wales</hi>; Then his Acts with <hi>Scotland</hi>; And lastly with <hi>France.</hi> And first, concerning his Lords, he gave them good contentment in the beginning of his Raigne, by enlarging their liberties, and granting them easier Lawes, for which purpose he called a Parliament, wherein were made the Statutes called of <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> the first, so as he had no difference with them, till toward the end of his Raigne, as shall be shewed hereafter. In the next place, concerning his Acts with his Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, he began with them betimes; for having lived to be of good age, three or foure and thirty yeares old, in his Fathers Raigne, he observed in that time, that their power was too predominant, and therefore thought fit to clip their wings; at least to keepe them from farther growing: which he did by these meanes: First, in the sixth yeare of his Raigne, he deprived many chiefe Monasteries of their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, and tooke from the Abbot and Covent of <hi>Westminster,</hi> the Returne of
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:52616:71"/>
Writs granted them by the Charter of his Father, King <hi>Henry</hi> the third. The next yeare after he got to be enacted the Statute of Mortmaine, to hinder the encrease of their Temporall Possessions. In the second Statute of <hi>Westminster,</hi> he defalked the Jurisdiction of Ecclesiasticall Judges; and growing more upon them, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the moity of all their Goods, as well Temporall as Spirituall, for one yeare. Then cals he a Parliament of his Nobles at <hi>Salisbury,</hi> without admission of any Church-men in it: And it is worth the noting, that <hi>Marchian</hi> his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer, acquainting him that in Churches and Religious houses, there was much treasure to be had, if it might be taken; he made no scruple of it, but caused it to be taken and brought into his Exchequer. But finding his Prelates not well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with it, to please them againe, he bids them aske something of him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they should see how much he favoured them. And they asking of him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale the Statute of Mortmaine, that had beene made so much to their hinderance; He answered, that this was a Statute made by the whole body of the Realme, and therefore was not in his power, who was but one Member of that Body, to undoe that which all the Members together had done; and perhaps whatsoever they should have asked else, he would have had an answer to redeeme his Offer. And thus much concerning his Clergy.</p>
               <p>In the next place are the <hi>Welsh,</hi> who had themselves begun with the King: For their Prince <hi>Leolyn</hi> being summoned to attend at his Coronation, refused to come; and afterward at more leisure, being required to come and doe his Homage, he stood upon termes of safe conduct, pretending doubt to be used, as his Father <hi>Gryf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin</hi> had beene; who upon hard usage in the Tower, seeking to make escape, fell from the Walls and brake his necke. But indeed it was alwayes a Custome with this Nation, at every change of Princes in <hi>England,</hi> to try conclusions, hoping at one time or other to have a day of it, and to change their yoke of bondage into li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; for which they were never better Provided then now; especially (which is the greatest matter in Warre) having a Valiant Prince to be their Leader. But there happened an accident which tooke off their edge at this time: For the Lady <hi>Eleanor,</hi> a Daughter of the late Earle <hi>Simon Montford,</hi> whom Prince <hi>Leolyn</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely loved, being passing out of <hi>France</hi> into <hi>Wales,</hi> was by the way upon the Sea taken by <hi>English</hi> ships, and brought to King <hi>Edward,</hi> and for the love of her, Prince <hi>Leolyn</hi> was content to submit himselfe to any conditions: which besides subjection of his State, was to pay fifty thousand pounds Sterling, and a thousand pounds <hi>per annum</hi> during his life; and upon these conditions the marriage with his beloved Lady was granted him, and was solemnized here in <hi>England,</hi> whereat the King and Queene were themselves present. Three yeares <hi>Leolyn</hi> continued loyall, and within bounds of obedience, in which time <hi>David,</hi> one of his Brothers, stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here in <hi>England,</hi> and found by the King to be of a stirring Spirit, was much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by him; Knighted, and matched to a rich Widow, Daughter of the Earle of <hi>Darby,</hi> and had given him by the King besides, the Castle of <hi>Denbigh,</hi> with a thousand pounds <hi>per annum</hi>: though (as it was afterwards found) he lived here but in the nature of a spy: For when Prince <hi>Leolyns</hi> Lady was afterward dead, and that he (contrary to his Conditions formerly made) brake out into rebellion, then goes his Brother <hi>David</hi> to him, notwithstanding all these Favours of the King: and they together enter the <hi>English</hi> Borders: Surprise the Castles of <hi>Flynt</hi> and <hi>Rut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> with the person of the Lord <hi>Clifford,</hi> sent Justiciar into those parts: and in a great Battaile overthrew the Earles of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Surrey,</hi> with the slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Sir <hi>William Lyndsey,</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Tanny,</hi> and many others.

In this meane time the Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> had gone of himselfe to Prince <hi>Leolin,</hi> and had labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to bring him and his brother <hi>David</hi> to a re-submission, but could effect nothing; for besides other reasons that swayed Prince <hi>Leolin,</hi> the conceit of a Prophesie of <hi>Merlin,</hi> that he should shortly be Crowned with the Diadem of <hi>Brute,</hi> so over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weighed him, that he had no care for peace, and shortly after no head: for after the Earle of <hi>Pembroke</hi> had taken <hi>Bere</hi> Castle, which was the seat of Prince <hi>Leolin,</hi> he was himself slain in battell; and his head cut off by a common Souldier, was sent to King <hi>Edw.</hi> who caused the same to be Crowned with Ivie, and to be set upon the Tower of <hi>London</hi>; And this was the end of <hi>Leolin,</hi> the last of the <hi>Welsh</hi> Princes, betraied (as some write) by the men of <hi>Buelth.</hi> Not long after his brother <hi>David</hi> also is taken in <hi>Wales,</hi> and judged in <hi>England</hi> to an ignominious death: First, drawn at a horse taile about the City of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> then beheaded, the trunke of his body divided, his heart and bowels burnt, his head sent to accompany his brothers on the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> his foure quarters to foure Cities, <hi>Bristow, North<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The Prince (whom the King then likewise knighted, and gave him the Dutchy of <hi>Aquitaine,</hi> kept his Vigile with his Traine at <hi>Westminster,</hi> and the next day girds these three hundred knights, with the Military Belt, in such manner as he himselfe had received it. Which done, the King before them all makes a Vow, that alive or dead, he would revenge the death of <hi>Cummyn</hi> upon <hi>Bruce,</hi> and the perjured <hi>Scots</hi>: Adjuring his Sonne and all the Nobles about him, upon their Fealty, that if he dyed in this Journey, they should carry his Corps with them about <hi>Scotland,</hi> and not suffer it to be interred, till they had vanquished the Usurper, and absolutely brought the Country to Subjection. The Prince and all the Nobles promise upon their Faith, to imploy their uttermost power to performe his Vow: and herewithall he sets forth with a potent Army, presently after <hi>Whitsontide,</hi> and makes his last Expedition into <hi>Scotland,</hi> in the foure and thirtieth yeare of his Raigne.</p>
               <p>The Earle of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> with that power sent before, and aid of the <hi>Scottish</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, had before the King arrived in <hi>Scotland,</hi> defeated in a battaile neare Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> Towne, the whole Army of the new King, and narrowly missed the taking of his Person, but he escaping in disguise, and sheltring himselfe in obscure places, was reserved for greater Battailes, his Brothers <hi>Nigell, Bruce,</hi> and shortly after, <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> a Priest, were taken and Executed after the manner of Traytors at <hi>Berwicke.</hi> And now King <hi>Edward</hi> had done for Fighting, all was now for Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, and indeed his desire of Revenge made him inexorable, and vow to spare none of what degree soever. The Earle of <hi>Atholl,</hi> (though of Royall blood, and allyed unto him) was sent to <hi>London,</hi> where all his preferment was, to have a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er paire of Gallowes then the rest. The Wife of <hi>Robert Bruce,</hi> taken by the Lord <hi>Rosse,</hi> is sent Prisoner to <hi>London,</hi> and his Daughter to a Monastery in <hi>Lindsey.</hi> The Countesse of <hi>Boughan,</hi> who had beene ayding at <hi>Bruces</hi> Coronation, is put into a woodden Cage, and hung out upon the walls of <hi>Berwicke</hi> for people to gaze on. But though <hi>Bruces</hi> party was thus dejected, and himselfe at this time appeared not, but shifted privily from place to place, in a distressed manner, (attended onely with two Noble Gentlemen, who neeer forsooke him in his misfortunes, the Earle of <hi>Lenox</hi> and <hi>Gilbert Hay</hi>) yet gives he not over, but gathers new Forces, with which he suddenly assailes the Earle of <hi>Pembroke</hi> at unawares, gives him a great defeate, and within three dayes after chaseth the Earle of <hi>Glocester</hi> into the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle of <hi>Aire,</hi> where he besieged him, till by the Kings Forces he was driven againe to his former retire. Whereupon King <hi>Edward,</hi> who had spent his Winter at <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lile,</hi> in <hi>Iuly</hi> following with a fresh Army enters <hi>Scotland</hi> himselfe, but falling into a Dysentery or Bloody-flix, at <hi>Borough</hi> upon the Sands he ended his life: and thus ended King <hi>Edwards</hi> troubles with <hi>Scotland,</hi> but not <hi>Englands</hi> troubles, which are more to come, then yet are past.</p>
               <p>But though this businesse of <hi>Scotland</hi> never left King <hi>Edward</hi> till his dying day, yet it had been upon him but as an Ague, sometimes putting him into violent heats, and sometimes leaving him in a quiet temper, with such a vicissitude, that when he had quietnesse with <hi>Scotland,</hi> he had troubles with <hi>France,</hi> whereof the time is now to speake. It is well knowne, that <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> Father of the present King, and <hi>Edward</hi> King of <hi>England</hi> were neare Cousins, the Sonnes of two Sisters; and it hath beene shewed before at King <hi>Edwards</hi> returning from the Holy Land, and passing through <hi>France,</hi> what extraordinary kindnesse and mutuall courtesie passed betweene them, that one would have thought neither they no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For private men may easily continue Friends, as having none to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider but themselves; but Princes hardly, as having besides themselves, their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to consider.

there can never be but jealousies, and where jealousies are, every trifle makes a quarrell. And this was the case of these two Kings, certaine of the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> Subjects, had upon the Coast of <hi>Normandy</hi> done spoyle to some Subjects of the King of <hi>France</hi>: and this difference of the Subjects made a difference betweene the Kings, while each of them standing in defence of his owne, fall out themselves; and for a beginning the King of <hi>France</hi> summons King <hi>Edward,</hi> as owing homage to that Crowne, to appeare and answer it in his Court. And King <hi>Edward,</hi> though voluntarily before he had done it in a way of Courtesie, yet being now impetiously commanded, he refuseth it: upon which refusall, all his Territories in <hi>France</hi> are condemned to be forfaited, and an Army is presently sent to seise upon the same, led by <hi>Charles de Valois,</hi> and <hi>Arnold de Neele,</hi> Constable of <hi>France.

As likewise did another Commission at the same time, sent forth to examine the behaviour of Officers, and Ministers of Justice; wherein many were found Delinquents, and paid dearly for it. At this time also he called his Lords to account for their stubbornnesse some yeares before, in denying to attend him into <hi>Flanders</hi>; which brought him in profit answerable to their greatnesse that were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.

Concerning his conditions, as he was in warre peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; so in Peace he was warlike, delighting specially in that kinde of hunting, which is to kill Stagges or other wilde beasts with Speares. In continencie of life, he was equall to his Father; in acts of valour, farre beyond him.

And now in the very Act of his Coronation, there was given another provocation to the Lords against <hi>Gaveston</hi>: for the King had appointed him to carry the Crowne of Saint <hi>Edward</hi> before him, (the greatest honour could be done to a Subject) which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the other honours the King had done him, (for he had made him Earle of <hi>Cornewall,</hi> Lord of <hi>Man,</hi> and Lord Chamberlaine) so incensed the Lords, that they entred into consultation, how to suppresse this violence of the Kings affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which shortly after they put in execution.

Hereupon <hi>Gaveston</hi> is sent away into <hi>Ireland,</hi> where he lived awhile, not as a banisht man, but as Lieutenant rather of the Country, and indeed not unworthily; for in the time of his being there, he is said to have made a Journey into the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and to have broken and subdued the Rebels there; built <hi>New Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle</hi> in the <hi>Kerns</hi> Country, repaired the Castle of <hi>Kevyn,</hi> and passed up to <hi>Munster,</hi> and <hi>Thoumond:</hi> performing every where much service with great valour and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse, that if he had stayed there but a while longer, he might perhaps by his desorts in <hi>Ireland,</hi> have redeemed his defects in <hi>England</hi>: but the King impatient of his absence, and asking advice what meanes might be used to recall him; It was told him, that if he could but match him with the Earle of <hi>Glocesters</hi> sister, a man of such greatnesse, and so greatly beloved of the people, for his sake certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no man would grudge at his comming home. Hereupon the King sends for <hi>Gaveston,</hi> and makes up the match betweene them, and marryed they were at <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kamstead</hi>; but this did no good. For <hi>Gaveston</hi> still working upon the King in such manner, that he scarce left him meanes to sustaine himselfe, and as little to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the Queene; nothing being done but as <hi>Gaveston</hi> would have it; put the Lords into a new discontentment; who thereupon went againe to the King, and told him plainly, that unlesse he would put <hi>Gaveston</hi> out of the Court and kingdome, they would rise up in Armes against him as a perjured King. This put the King into a great strait: Loath he was to leave <hi>Gaveston,</hi> and fearefull he was to provoke the Lords; in the end, his feare prevailing over his love, he was content he should be Banished, and in such sort Banished, that if ever he returned, or were found in the kingdome, he should be held, and proceeded against as an Enemy of the State. So once againe is <hi>Gaveston</hi> sent packing out of the kingdome, and goes into <hi>France,</hi> but found no safe Harbouring there: For the King of <hi>France</hi> hearing of it, gave strait charge, if he were found in his Dominions to apprehend him: Then he pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth into <hi>Flanders,</hi> but is there no sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The King receives him as an Angell sent from Heaven, and to be out of the Lords Eye, goes a Journey to <hi>Yorke,</hi> taking <hi>Gaveston</hi> along with him, and there thinkes to be in quiet; but the Lords hearing of it follow him thither, chusing for their Generall, <hi>Thomas</hi> Earle of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> a man possest of five Earledomes, <hi>Lancaster, Leycester, Ferrers, Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colne,</hi> and <hi>Salisbury,</hi> besides the Liberty of <hi>Pickering,</hi> and the Honour of <hi>Coker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi> and other Lands in <hi>Wales</hi>; and there was not a man of the whole Nobility that was not of the Party, but onely <hi>Gilbert</hi> Earle of <hi>Glocester,</hi> the Kings Sisters Sonne; These Lords sent to the King, either to deliver <hi>Gaveston</hi> into their hands, or at least to send him peremptorily out of the kingdome. But the King led by ill Counsell, and little regarding the Lords Message, takes <hi>Gaveston</hi> with him to <hi>New-Castle</hi> upon <hi>Tine,</hi> thence to <hi>Tynmouth,</hi> where the Queene then lay, who (though great with Childe, and entreating the King with teares to stay with her) yet such was his desire to see <hi>Gaveston</hi> put into some place of security, that hearing of the Lords approaching, he tooke a Ship, and passed with <hi>Gaveston</hi> to <hi>Scarborough,</hi> and

leaving him there in a strong Castle, not easie to be wonne, he went himselfe into <hi>Warwickshire</hi>; perhaps that the Lords might see he had not <hi>Gaveston</hi> with him.

His Corps was carryed to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and kept there two yeares, till the King caused it to be brought to <hi>Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> and there builded a Monastery of purpose, where his Soule should be prayed for.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Gaveston</hi> was the Sonne of a Gentleman of <hi>France,</hi> who had done good ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for King <hi>Edward</hi> the first, in <hi>France</hi>; and for his sake this Sonne of his was taken and brought up with the Prince: a man of excellent parts of body, and of no lesse Endowments of minde; Valiant and Witty; to which if we might adde Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, he had beene compleate; Though the Lords (whether they had heard so, or whether they said it to weane the King from him) told the King that his Father was a Traitor to the King of <hi>France,</hi> and for the same was executed; and that his Mother was burnt for a Witch; and that this <hi>Gaveston</hi> was banished out of <hi>France</hi> for consenting to his Mothers Witch-craft; and that he had now bewitched the King himselfe. But why should the Lords be so violent against <hi>Gaveston</hi>? might not the King place his Affection where he pleased? Might he not make his owne choyce of what companion he liked? No doubt he might; and fit he should: but yet in this case, the Lords had great cause to doe as they did; both in regard of the King, of themselves, and of the Common-wealth. It is true, if the Valour of <hi>Gaveston</hi> could as well have made the King Valiant, as his riot made him riotous; there might some good have come of their extraordinary conjunction: but seeing Vertues are but personall, Vices onely are communicative; it now made the King not onely more Vicious then otherwise he would have beene, but Vicious, where otherwise he would not have beene; and therefore great cause in regard of the King, to remove <hi>Gaveston</hi> from his company; and no lesse in regard of the Lords themselves; For <hi>Gavestons</hi> advancing was their debasing; his greatnesse with the King made them but Cyphers: but in regard of the Common-wealth, most cause of all; For while the King was altogether ruled by <hi>Gaveston,</hi> and <hi>Gaveston</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe was altogether irregular; the Common-wealth could have but little hope of Justice, but was sure to suffer as long as <hi>Gaveston</hi> was suffered. And this may be sufficient to justifie the Lords, that it be not interpreted to be Rebellion, which was indeed but Providence.</p>

But indeed the <hi>Scots,</hi> besides Valour, used Policy: For having in their owne Army none but Foot, no Horse at all, they had made Trenches in the Ground three foot deepe, covering them with Twigges and Hurdles, where the <hi>English</hi> Horsemen were to passe, who Floundring in those Trenches, were killed no lesse by their owne Fellowes then by the Enemy.

               <p>HE was faire of body, and of great strength, but given much to drinke, which made him oftentimes bewray his owne Secrets; For his other conditions, his greatest fault was, that he loved but one, for if his love had beene divided, it could not have beene so violent. He was extreame in nothing but in loving; and though love moderated, be the best of affections, yet the extremity of it is the worst of pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions. He was rather unfortunate then unhappy; seeing unfortunatenesse is in the Event, unhappinesse in the Cause; and if his fortune had beene to love good men, his owne goodnesse would have made him happy. Two Vertues were eminent in him above all his Predecessours, Continence, and Abstinence: So continent that he left no base issue behind him; So abstinent, that he tooke no base courses for rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of money.

                  <hi>Northampton,</hi> where the King made three Earles: <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Eltham</hi> his brother, Earle of <hi>Cornwall; Roger Mortimer,</hi> Earle of <hi>March,</hi> and <hi>Iames Butler</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> Earle of <hi>Ormond:</hi> and in this Parliament a dishonourable peace is concluded with the <hi>Scots,</hi> and confirmed by a match betweene <hi>David Bruce</hi> Prince of <hi>Scotland,</hi> being but se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven yeares old, and <hi>Ioane</hi> sister to King <hi>Edward,</hi> not so old; at which time, by the secret working of Queene <hi>Isabell, Roger Mortimer</hi> and Sir <hi>Iames Dowglasse</hi>; the King surrenders by his Charter, all his title of Soveraignty to the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland,</hi> restores divers Deeds and Instruments of their former Homages and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alties, with the famous Evidence called <hi>Ragmans Roll,</hi> and many ancient Jewels and Monuments, amongst which was the blacke Crosse of <hi>Scotland</hi>; and besides, any <hi>English</hi> man is prohibited to hold lands in <hi>Scotland,</hi> unlesse he were a dweller there. In consideration whereof King <hi>Bruce</hi> was to pay thirty thousand Markes, and to renounce his claime to the Counties of <hi>Cumberland</hi> and <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and any other place possessed by him in <hi>England.</hi> This was no good beginning, and yet worse followed after. For another Parliament being holden at <hi>Winchester, Edmund</hi> Earle of <hi>Kent,</hi> the Kings Unkle, is there accused, and condemned upon his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, for intending to restore his brother, the late King <hi>Edward</hi>; an intention onely without any fact; yet condemned he was, and brought to the Scaffold, but generally, so beloved of the people, that he stood on the Scaffold from one a clocke till five, before any executioner could be found that would doe the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, till at last a silly wretch of the Marshalsey was gotten to cut off his head. But the Authors of his death escaped not long themselves, for in the third yeare of the Kings Raigne, another Parliament is holden at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> wherein the Queen hath all her great Joynture taken from her, and is put to her Pension of a thousand pounds a yeare, and her selfe confined to a Castle, where she remained the rest of her dayes, no fewer then thirty yeares, a time long enough to finde that her being the daughter of a King, the sister of a King, the wife of a King, and the mother of a King, were glorious titles, but all not worth the liberty of a meane estate; and as for <hi>Mortimer,</hi> (lying then in the Castle of <hi>Nottingham</hi>) and lately created Earle of the <hi>Marches</hi> of <hi>Wales</hi>) he was seised on in this manner; the King taking with him <hi>William Montacute, Robert Holland,</hi> and others, goe secretly one night by Torch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, through a privie way under ground, till they came to the Queenes Chamber, where leaving the King without, they entred, and found the Queene with <hi>Mortimer,</hi> ready to goe to bed: then laying hands on him, they led him forth, after whom the Queene followed, crying, <hi>Bel fits, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But thus seised on, he is committed presently to the Tower, accused of divers great crimes, whereof these were chiefe; that he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured the late Kings death; that he had beene the author of the <hi>Scots</hi> safe escaping at <hi>Stanhope</hi> Parke, corrupted with the gift of thirty thousand pounds; that he had procured the late marriage and Peace with <hi>Scotland,</hi> so dishonourable to the King and kingdome; that he had beene too familiar with the Queene, as by whom she was thought to be with child: of which Articles he is found guilty, and condemned; and thereupon is drawne and hanged on the common Gallowes at the Elmes, now called <hi>Tiburne,</hi> where his body remained two dayes as an opprobrious spectacle for all beholders.</p>

               <p>HE was of stature indifferent tall, of sparkling eyes, of a comely and manly countenance, in his later time something bald; and concerning his conditions, no man was more gentle, where there was submission; where opposition, no man more sterne. He was a Prince no lesse of his passions, then of his people; for he was never so loving, as to be fond; nor ever so angry, as to be inexorable: but this must be understood of the time while he was a man, for in his old age, when he came to be a childe againe, he was Prince of neither. He was no lesse fortunate then valiant; and his fortunatenes was the greater by a kind of <hi>Antiperistatis,</hi> as comming betweene two unfortunate Princes; Successour to one, and Predecessour to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. He was of so warlike a disposition, that his very sports were warlike; for no delights were so frequent with him as Justs and Tournaments. To shew his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, one example may be sufficient, for when neither Cardinals nor Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours could move him to make peace with <hi>France,</hi> a tempest from Heaven did it; to which may be added, that he never wanne great battell, of which he wanne many, but he presently gave the glory of it to God by publike Thanksgiving. He out-lived the best wife, and the best sonne that ever King had; and to say the truth, he out-lived the best of himselfe, for his later years were not answerable to his former.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Neither is it impertinent to declare the Confession of <hi>Iack Straw</hi> at his execution: <q>When we were assembled (said he) upon <hi>Blackheath,</hi> and had sent to the K. to c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And now all parts being quiet, the King by Proclamation revoked and made void his former Charters of Infranchising the Bondmen of the Realme; and that they should stand in the same condition they were before. In the time of this sedition, the Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> had been sent into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to keep the <hi>Scots</hi> quiet; who so carried the matter, that before the <hi>Scots</hi> heard of the Sedition, a Truce was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for two or three yeeres. But the Duke comming back to <hi>Berwick,</hi> was denied by the Captaine Sir <hi>Matthew Redman,</hi> to enter the Towne, because of a Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement given him by the Earle of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> L. Warden of the Marches, not to suffer any person to enter the same; which the King indeed had appointed to be done, forgetting the Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> that was then in <hi>Scotland:</hi> but howsoever, this bred such a spleen in the Duke against the Earle, that at his comming home, he laid many things to the Earles charge, and the Earle as stoutly answered his objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and so farre it proceeded, that both of them came to the Parliament which was then beginning, with great numbers of Armed men, and themselves in Armour, to the great terrour of the people: but the King, wisely taking the matter into his owne hands, made them friends.

After the Mariage, the Parliament began againe; in which <hi>William Vfford</hi> Earle of <hi>Suffolke</hi> being chosen by the Knights of the Shires to deliver in behalfe of the Commonwealth certaine matters concerning the same, the very day and houre in which he should have done the businesse, as he went up the

staires towards the upper House, he suddenly fell down and dyed, having been merry and well before, to all mens judgements. About this time the Lord <hi>Scroope</hi> was deposed from the Chancellourship, for refusing to seale some Grants which the King had made: and the King receiving the great Seale at his hands, kept it a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine time, and sealed with it such Grants and Writings as he pleased; till at length it was delivered to <hi>Robert Braybrooke</hi> Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> who was made Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour.</p>

But when the Lords were ready to come at the day appointed, they heard of an Ambush laid to intrap them at the <hi>Mewes,</hi> and thereupon stayed, so as they came not at the time appointed: Whereupon, the king asking why they came not according to their promise?

Richard</hi> stayed all that winter, and after Christmas called a Parliament; at which time also, the Duke of <hi>Yorke</hi> Lord Warden of <hi>England,</hi> in the Kings name called a Parliament at <hi>Westminster:</hi> to the which was sent forth of <hi>Ireland</hi> the Duke of <hi>Glocester,</hi> that he might declare to the Commons the Kings great occasions for supply of money: whose words so farre prevailed, that a whole Tenth was granted by the Clergie, and a Fifteenth by the Laytie.</p>
               <p>In his Twentieth yeere was the famous Enterview between the two Kings of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France:</hi> There was set up for <hi>K. Richard</hi> a rich Pavilion, a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond <hi>Guysnes,</hi> within the <hi>English</hi> pale; and another the like for the <hi>French</hi> King, on this side <hi>Arde:</hi> The distance betwixt the two Tents was beset on either side with Knights armed with thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> swords in their hands, foure hundred <hi>French</hi> on one side, and foure hundred <hi>English</hi> on the other: The two Kings before their meeting, took a solemne Oath, for assurance of their faithfull and true meaning, to observe the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Lawes of Amity one toward another, in this Enterview. After the two Kings were come together, it was accorded, that in the same place where they met, there should be builded at both their costs, a Chappell, for a perpetuall memory, which should be called, The Chappell of our Lady of Peace. On <hi>Simon</hi> and <hi>Iudes</hi> day, the kings talked together of Articles concerning the Peace; and having conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them, they received either of them an Oath, upon the holy Evangelists, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve and keepe them. This done, the <hi>French</hi> king brought his daughter <hi>Isabel,</hi> and delivered her to <hi>K. Richard,</hi> who shortly after at <hi>Callis</hi> maried her, and upon the 17. of January following, she was Crowned Queen at <hi>Westminster.</hi> A Match of great honour, but of little conveniency, and lesse profit; for the Lady being but eight yeeres of age, there could be no hope of issue a long time, which was <hi>K. Richards</hi> greatest want; and as little supply of his wants otherwise, her Portion perhaps scarce paying the charges of his journey to fetch her, which cost him three hundred thousand markes.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> in the thirteenth yeere of <hi>K. Richards</hi> Reigne, had been created Duke of <hi>Aquitaine:</hi> but when the <hi>Gascoigners</hi> would not receive him, shewing reasons why that Dukedome ought not to be separated from the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> his Grant was revoked, and so it remained still in Demesne of the Crown.</p>
               <p>At this time, in a Parliament, the Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> caused to be legitimated, the issue he had by <hi>Katherine Swinford,</hi> before he maried her; of whom, <hi>Thomas Beaufort</hi> was created Earle of <hi>Sommerset.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This yeere also, the king receiviug the money back, which had been lent to the Duke of <hi>Britaine,</hi> upon <hi>Brest,</hi> delivered up the Towne unto him; and thereupon, the English souldiers that were there in Garrison, were all discharged and sent home; who, at a Feast which the king kept at <hi>Westminster,</hi> comming in companies together into the Hall; as soone as the king had dined, and was entring into his Chamber, the Duke of <hi>Glocester</hi> asked him, if he did marke those men that stood in such troops in the Hall: Yes marry (said the king) who were they? They were (said the Duke) those souldiers, who by your rendring up of <hi>Brest</hi> have been sent home, and now must either starve or steale; and therewithall, very unadvisedly in words, taxed the king with unadvisednes of his deed: To whom the king in great anger reply'd, Why Unkle, doe you thinke me either a Merchant, or a Foole, to sell my land? By S. <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> no: But could I refuse to render the Town, when tender was made of the money lent upon it? Indeed nothing could more discover the Duke of <hi>Glocesters,</hi> either weaknesse, if he knew not that <hi>Brest</hi> was but onely a Morgage; or injustice, if knowing it, he would have had the king, though the money were ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, to have kept it still: but such is the course of many, to take part with the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks against the Ethicks; work their ends by doing unjustly, when doing justly ought to be their chiefest end. How-ever it was, the multiplying of words about
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52616:107"/>
this matter, kindled in the King such a displeasure against the Duke, that it could never afterward be quenched, but by his blood. And first he complained to his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two Unkles, the Dukes of <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It happened, that the Duke of <hi>Glocester</hi> had with him one day at his house, the Abbot of S. <hi>Albans,</hi> that was his Godfather, and the Prior of <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster:</hi> and after dinner falling in talke with them, amongst other communications the Duke required the Prior to tell truth, whether he had any Vision the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? To which the Prior was loath, at first, to make a direct Answer; but at last, being earnestly requested, as well by the Abbot as the Duke, he confessed that he had a Vision indeed, which was, that the Realme of <hi>England</hi> should be destroyed through the Misgovernance of <hi>K. Richard.</hi> By the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> (said the Abbot) I had the very same Vision.

The King courteously requested him to goe and make him ready, for that he must needs ride with him a little way, to conferre of some busines. The Duke presently made him ready and came downe; and as soone as the King and his Company was gone a little way from the house, and the Duke with him, the Earle Marshall arrested the Duke, as he had been appointed to doe by the King; who immediately was sent to <hi>Callis,</hi> where, after some time, he was dispatched of his life, either strangled, or else smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered with pillowes, as some write. At the very same time was the Earle of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rundell</hi> apprehended, by the Earles of <hi>Rutland</hi> and <hi>Kent:</hi> the Earle of <hi>Warwick</hi> also, when the King had invited him to dinner, and shewed him very good countenance, was taken and arrested in the place: As likewise at the same time were apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and committed to the Tower, the Lord <hi>Iohn Cobham,</hi> and Sir <hi>Iohn Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then Sir <hi>Iohn Bushie,</hi> Speaker of the Parliament, made request on behalfe of the Commonalty, that they might be punished according to their deservings; and specially the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When the Archbishop began to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, Sir <hi>Iohn Bushie</hi> besought the king that he might not be admitted to answer, lest by his great wit and cunning he might lead men away to believe him. And here Sir <hi>Iohn Bushie</hi> in all his talke did not attribute to the king Titles of honour due and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ccustomed, but such as were fitter for the Majestie of God then for any Earthly Prince. And when the Archbishop was constrained to keepe silence, Sir <hi>Iohn Bushie</hi> proceeded; requiring on the behalfe of the Commons, that the Charters of Pardon, granted to the Duke of <hi>Glocester,</hi> and the Earles of <hi>Arundell</hi> and <hi>Warwick,</hi> should be revoked. The king for his part protested that they were drawne from him by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion, and therefore besought them to deliver their opinions, what they thought thereof: whereupon, the Bishops first gave their sentence, that the said Pardons were revocable, and might be called in; but pretending a scrupulosity, as if they might not with safe consciences be present where Judgement of Blood should passe, they appointed a Lay-man to be their Prolocutor for that turne. The Temporall Lords likewise gave their sentence, that the Pardons were revocable: onely the Judges and Lawyers were not of this opinion. But howsoever, the Archbishop of <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There went to see the execution, divers Lords; amongst whom was the Earle of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> that had maried his daughter, and the Earle of <hi>Kent,</hi> that was his daughters sonne: to whom, at the place of his execution he said, Truly it would have beseemed you rather to bee absent, then here at this businesse; but the time will come ere long, that as many shall marvell at your mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, as they doe now at mine. After his death, a Fame went, that his head was grown to his body againe: whereupon, the tenth day after his buriall, his body, by the kings appointment was taken up, and then found to be a Fable. After this, the Lord <hi>Thomas Beauchamp</hi> Earle of <hi>Warwick</hi> was brought forth, and charged with the like Treasons; but by the intercession of the Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> and other Lords, after confession of his fault, was only confin'd into the Isle of <hi>Man.</hi> Likewise the lord <hi>Cobha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>Aquitaines</hi> also, and specially the Citizens of <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> as being the place where <hi>K.

In this meane time king <hi>Henry,</hi> not acquainted with this Conspiracy, caused a Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to bee made, intimating that the Earle of <hi>March</hi> had voluntarily caused himself to bee taken prisoner, to the end, the Rebels having him in their custody, might pretend some colour for their Conspiracy; and therefore hee had small reason to take care for his deliverance.

Once, it is said, he lay in wait for the Receivers of his fathers Rents, and in the person of a Thiefe set upon them and robbed them. Another time, when one of his companions was arraigned for felony before the Lord Chiefe Justice, he went to the Kings Bench barre, and offered to take the Prisoner away by force; but being withstood by the Lord Chiefe Justice, he stepped to him, and struck him over the face: whereat the Judge nothing abashed, rose up and told him, that he did not this affront to him, but to the King his father, in whose place he sate; and therefore to make him know his fault, he commanded him to be committed to the Fleete. You would have wondred to see how calme the Prince was in his own cause, who in the cause of his companion had been so violent: for he quietly obeyed the Judges sentence, and suffered himselfe to be led to Prison.

            <p>About this time, in <hi>France,</hi> a strange Impostor ariseth; a maid called <hi>la Pucelle,</hi> taking upon her to be sent from God, for the good of <hi>France,</hi> and to expell the English: and some good indeed she did; for by her subtle working, the King was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into <hi>Champaigne,</hi> and many Townes were rendred to him; whil'st the Lord <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>In this time of the Regents absence from <hi>Paris,</hi> the King of <hi>France</hi> drew all his forces thither, using all meanes possible, by Escalado, Battery, and burning the gates, to enter the City; but was so withstood by the vigilancy of the Citizens, that he was glad to sound Retreat, leaving his slaine and maimed souldiers behind him, all but the <hi>Pucelle,</hi> who being hurt in the legge, and almost stifled with myre in the ditch, was by a servant of the Duke of <hi>Alanson</hi> drawne up, and conveyed after the King to <hi>Berry,</hi> who by the way received the submission of the Inhabitants of <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Some other services were performed on both sides, by the Duke of <hi>Suffolk</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Kyriell,</hi> for the English; by the Bastard of <hi>Orleance</hi> and Sir <hi>Stephe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>And now, the Regent finding how much the Crowning of the French king had furthered his designes, he made account the like effect would follow the Crowning of King <hi>Henry</hi> in <hi>France:</hi> whereupon he is sent for to come over; and comming to <hi>Paris,</hi> was, by his Uncle the Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi> and Cardinall of <hi>Eusebius,</hi> not yet above nine yeares old, with all usuall ceremonies Crowned King of <hi>France,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the oaths of Homage and Fealty of all the French Nobility that were present, and of all the Inhabitants of <hi>Paris,</hi> and of the places adjacent.

Upon this, the Regent (whose wife, the Sister of the Duke of <hi>Burgoig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The king was easily induced to credit the relation; but divers of the kings Councell, especially the Duke of <hi>Glocester,</hi> opposed it; partly for the meannesse of the match, her father being onely a Titular Prince, and withall but poore, unable to give any portion at all; and partly, for the wrong which should hereby be offered to the Duke of <hi>Arminiacks</hi> daughter, to whom the king had been in solemne manner publickly affianced.

            <p>The Queen in the mean time encouraged by the death of the Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi> with a power of Northern men marcheth towards <hi>London</hi>: but when her souldiers were once South of Trent, as if that river were the utmost limit of their good behaviour, they fell to forrage the Country in most babarous manner: Approaching S. <hi>Albans,</hi> they were advertised that the Duke of <hi>Norfolke</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Warwick</hi> were ready to give them battell; whereupon the Queens Vaward hasteth to passe through St. <hi>Alb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

was, that he had in him too much of the Logge, and too little of the Storke; for he would not move, but as he was moved, and had rather be devoured, than he would devoure.

He had one immunity peculiar to himself, that no man could ever be revenged of him, seeing he never offered any man injury.

was shut up in strong prison, and narrowly looked too. As for the Earles of <hi>Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brooke</hi> and <hi>Richmond,</hi> who were fled out of the Realme, to the Duke of <hi>Britaine,</hi> king <hi>Edward</hi> sent to the Duke, requiring to have them delivered up unto him, upon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of great rewards; to which the Duke made answer, that he could no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> with his honour deliver them up, whom he had taken into his Protection; but that for king <hi>Edwards</hi> sake, he would take such care of them, that he should need to take no care for them; and to that end, he sequestred their own servants from them, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed <hi>Britaines</hi> to attend upon them.</p>
            <p>It was now the thirteenth year of king <hi>Edwards</hi> reigne; in which a Parliament was called at <hi>Westminster:</hi> wherein all acts formerly made by him, are confirmed or revived; and all their Lands and Goods confiscated, that had taken part against him and were fled and all their lands and goods restored to such as had taken part with him.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Edward</hi> being destin'd to be alwayes in troubles; now that he had quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse at home, was drawn into new broyles abroad; for the Duke of <hi>Burgoigne</hi> at this time having warres with <hi>France,</hi> thought he could no way make a better har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest to himselfe, then by sowing seeds of dissention between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi>; and to this end, he sends Ambassadours to king <hi>Edward,</hi> to sollicite him to set on foot his Title to the Crown of <hi>France</hi>; making great offers, with Protestation to assist him in it, both with Purse and Person. This proposition being seriously deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Kings Privy Counsell, is at last approved of, as being both lawfull and behovefull, for the honour of the King, and good of the kingdome. Onely means to beare the charges of the warre, were wanting; to supply which by a Parliamentary course, would ask too much time: a new course therefore is devised, to procure mony from the Subject by way of Benevolence; and this course was taken.</p>
            <p>About this time, <hi>Henry Holland</hi> Duke of <hi>Exceter</hi> and Earle of <hi>Huntington,</hi> dis-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herited by Act of Parliament, in the fourth yeer of this King, (though he had marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed King <hi>Edwards</hi> Sister; yet grew to so great misery, that passing over into <hi>Flanders,</hi> he was there forced all ragged and bare-foot to beg his bread:) was found dead, and stript naked, between <hi>Dover</hi> and <hi>Callice</hi>: but how he came to his death, no enquiry could bring to light.</p>
            <p>Provision for this French expedition being throughly made; and order taken for the quiet government of the kingdome in his absence, and the stop of incursions, if any by the <hi>Scots</hi> should be made: King <hi>Edward</hi> with an Army of fifteen hundred men at arms, all of the Nobility and Gentry, fifteen thousand Archers on horseback, eight thousand Common souldiers, and three thousand Pioners, came down to <hi>Dover</hi>; whither the Duke of <hi>Burgoigne</hi> had sent five hundred flat bottom'd boates, to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sport the Horse to <hi>Callice</hi>; yet for all that helpe, it was two and twenty dayes before the kings forces were all past over. Before the kings departure from <hi>Dover,</hi> (to the end he might not seem to surprize him) he sent an Herauld named <hi>Garter,</hi> a Norman by birth, with a letter of Defiance to the French king, (so well written, saith <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>The Queen in the mean time having intelligence of these dolefull accidents, and fearing there were worse to follow, with her second Son and five D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>At this time a messenger came from the Lord Chamberlaine, to the Archbishop of <hi>Yorke</hi> Lord Chancellour of <hi>England,</hi> to signifie to him, that there was no feare of any thing, for that he assured him all should be well. Well (quoth the Archbishop) be it as well as it will; I assure him, It will never be so well as we have seen it. And thereupon, presently after the messengers departure, he calleth up his servants (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then in the night) and taking the great Seale with him, came before day to the Queen, whom he found sitting alone aloe on the Rushes, all desolate and dismaied; whom he comforted the best he could, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

This warning sank so deep into the Queens minde, that after a little pausing, taking her Sonne by the hand, she said, My Lord Archbishop, here he is, for my own part I will never deliver him; but if you will needs have him, Take him, and at your hands I will require him; and therewith weeping bitterly, Deer childe (saith she) let me kisse thee before we part, God knows whether ever we shall meet againe; and so the childe weeping as fast as she, went along with the Archbishop to the <hi>Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber,</hi> where the Lord Protectour and other Lords had staid all the while look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for his comming back: and as soone as he was entred the roome, the Protectour spying the childe, riseth up and embraceth him saying, Deere Nephew, Now wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with all my heart: next to my Soveraigne Lord your brother, nothing gives me so much contentment as your Presence: and we may believe him, he spake as he thought; for now he had the prey which he so much desired. A few dayes after, pretending to have them lodged in a place of more security, untill the distempers of the Commonwealth might better be quieted; he caused them in great pompe and state to be conveyed through <hi>London</hi> to the <hi>Tower,</hi> there at pleasure to remaine, till the time of Coronation; whereof there was great shew of preparation made.</p>
            <p>But now the great work is to be done; the Princes are to be made away: and how to have it done, <hi>Hoc opus, hic labor est:</hi> there must be potent Instruments; and none so potent as the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi>; and he, by a match to be concluded betwixt their children, and an equall partition of the Treasure of the Realme betwixt them two; not onely is drawne to condiscend, but is most forward to contrive and plot stratagems to effect it.

I tell thee, They, and none but they have done it; and thou thy selfe art partaker of the villany. Who I my Lord, quoth he? yea Thou traytor, quoth the Protectour; and therewith, upon a watch-word given, those prepared before for that purpose, in the outer Chamber, cryed, Treason, Treason! when presently a great number of men in arm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> came rushing in as it were to guard the Protectour; one of which with a Pollax strook a maine blow at the Lord <hi>St<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Forthwith the Protectour arrested the Lord <hi>Hastings</hi> of high Treason; and wisht him to make haste to be Confessed, for he swore by S. <hi>Paul</hi> (his usuall Oath) that he would not touch bread nor drinke till his head were off.

               </gap> to ask, why? for he knew the Protectours actions were not to be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. So he was led forth unto the Greene before the Chappell within the <hi>Tower,</hi> where his head was laid downe upon a long logge of Tymber, and there strucken off. His body afterward with his head were interred at <hi>VVindsor,</hi> beside the body of King <hi>Edward.</hi> In this mans death we may see how inevitable the blowes of Destiny are: for the very night before his death, the Lord <hi>Stanley</hi> sent a secret messenger to him at midnight, in all the haste, to acquaint him with a Dreame hee had, in which hee thought that a Bore with his tusks so goared them both by the heads, that the blood ran about their shoulders: and for-as-much as the Protectour gave the Bore for his Cognisance, this Dreame made so fearefull an impression in his heart, that he was throughly resolved to stay no longer; and had made his horse ready, requiring the Lord <hi>Hastings</hi> to goe with him, and that presently, to be out of danger, before it should be day. But the Lord <hi>Hastings</hi> answered the messenger: Good Lord! lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth your Master so much to such trifles, to put such faith in dreames, which either his owne feare fanta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:52616:158"/>

               </gap>hat he thought nothing could be plotted against him, which he would not presently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale unto him. But this man deceived him; and was growne so inward with the Protectour, that being set by the Protectour to draw him to be a party in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes, and finding he could not doe it, was himselfe the first mover to rid him out of the way. Another warning the Lord <hi>Hastings</hi> had: the same morning in which he was beheaded, his horse twice or thrice stumbled with him, almost to falling; which though it often happen to such to whom no mischance is toward, yet hath it of old beene observed as a token foregoing some great misfortune. Also at the Tower-wharfe, neere to the place where his head soone after was strucken off, he met with one <hi>Hastings</hi> a Pursuivant of his own name; to whom he said: Ah <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stings,</hi> dost thou remember I met thee here once with a heavy heart! Yea my Lord, saith he, I remember it well; and God be thanked, that time is past. In faith, man, said the Lord <hi>Hastings,</hi> I never stood in so great dread of my life, as I did when thou and I met here: and loe how the world is changed! now stand my Enemies in the danger, as thou mayest hap to heare hereafter; (for the Enemies he meant were the Lord <hi>Rivers,</hi> and other of the Queens kindred, who that very day were beheaded at <hi>Pomfret</hi>) and I never so merry, nor in so good surety as now I am. That we may know, there is not a greater Omen or signe of ill fortune, than to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume of good. And indeed, such is the uncertainty of our estate in this life, that we seldome know when we are in a Tempest at Sea, nor when we are in a Calm on shore; thinking ourselves oftentimes most safe, when we are most in danger; and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to be in danger, when we are most safe: He onely is in the true Haven, that can say as Christ teacheth us, <hi>Thy will be done in Earth as it is in Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this Lord being thus put to death; the Lord Protectour, to colour the matter, immediately after dinner, in all haste sent for many substantiall Citizens; at whose comming, himselfe with the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> stood harnessed in old rusty Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gandines, to make a shew they were forced by the sudden danger to take such as they could first come by: and withall, a Herald of Armes is sent with a Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Kings name, signifying, that the Lord <hi>Hastings</hi> with some others had conspired the same day to have slaine the Lord Protector and the Duke of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> as they sate in Counsell; and after to have taken upon them to rule the King a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now was this Proclamation made within two houres after the Lord <hi>Hastings</hi> was beheaded; and was so curiously indited, and so so faire written in Parchment, and withall so long, that every childe might perceive it was prepared before: which made one that was Schoolemaster of <hi>Pauls,</hi> standing by when the Proclamation was read, to say, <hi>Here is a gay goodly Cast, foule cast away for haste:</hi> To whom a Merchant answered, <hi>It was written by Prophesie.</hi> And now by and by, as it were in revenge of her offence, the Protectour sent the Sheriffs of <hi>Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> into the house of <hi>Shores</hi> wife, and spoyled her of all her goods, above the value of three thousand markes; and then conveying her through <hi>London</hi> to the Tower, there left her Prisoner: where he laid to her charge, that she went about to bewitch him, and was of counsell with the Lord <hi>Hastings</hi> to destroy him. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, she was laid into <hi>Ludgate,</hi> and by the Bishop of <hi>London</hi> put to open Penance for incontinency; going before the Crosse in Procession, upon a Sunday, with a Taper in her hand: in which, although she were out of all array, save her ki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ny who hated her course of life, yet pittied her course usage, and were not a little grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to see her misery. And indeed, this may be said in her behalfe: that being in extraordinary favour with King <hi>Edward,</hi> yet she never used it to the hurt of any, but to the reliefe of many: and was ever a Mediatour, an Oppressour never.</p>
            <p>Now it was so contrived by the Protectour, that the very day in which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he Lord <hi>Hastings</hi> was beheaded at <hi>London,</hi> and about the very same houre, there were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed at <hi>Pomfret,</hi> the Lord <hi>Rivers</hi> and the other Lords and Knights that were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the King at <hi>Northampton</hi> and <hi>Stonistratford</hi>; which was done in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and by the order of Sir <hi>Richard Ratcliffe</hi> knight, whose service the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour

specially used in that businesse; who bringing them to the Scaffold, and not suffering them to declare their innocency, lest their words might have inclined men to hate the Protectour, caused them hastily without Judgement or Order of Processe to be beheaded.</p>
            <p>When these were thus rid out of the way, then thought the Protectour that now was the time to put himselfe in possession of the Crown: but all the study was, by what means this matter being so hein<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> knight the then Major of <hi>London</hi>; who upon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of advancement, should frame the peoples inclination to it. And because Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall men are best hearkened to for matters of Conscience, some of them were used also; amongst whom, choice was made of <hi>Iohn Shaw</hi> Clerk, brother to the Major; Fryer <hi>Penker,</hi> Provinciall of the Order of the <hi>Augustine</hi> Fryers: both great P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, both of more learning then vertue, of more fame then learning. These two were appointed to preach, the one at <hi>Pauls</hi> Crosse, the other at the <hi>Spittle,</hi> in praise of the Protectour: <hi>Penker</hi> in his Sermon so lost his voice, that he was saine to leave off and come downe in the midst: <hi>Shaw</hi> by his Sermon lost his reputation, and soon after his life, for he never after durst come abroad, for very shame of the world.</p>
            <p>But now was all the labour and study, to finde out some convenient pretext, for which the people should be content to have the Prince deposed, and the Protectour be received for King; to which purpose many things were devised; the cheife was to alleadge bastardy either in King <hi>Edward</hi> himselfe, or in his children, or in both<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ay bastardy to King <hi>Edward,</hi> sounded openly to the reproach of the Protectours own Mother, who was Mother to them both; he would therefore that point should more favourably be handled: but the other point concerning the bastardy of his children, he would have enforced to the uttermost: The ground whereof was, that King <hi>Edward</hi> had been formerly contracted to the Lady <hi>Elizabeth Lucie,</hi> by whom he had a childe; though the said Lady, having been examined about it, confessed plainly, they were never assured. Yet upon this pretext, Doctor <hi>Shaw</hi> taking for his Text, <hi>Bastard Plants shall take no deep roote</hi>; in his Sermon declared, that King <hi>Edward</hi> was never lawfully married to the Queen, but was before God, husband to the Lady <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth Lucie,</hi> and so his children bastards. And besides that, neither King <hi>Edward</hi> himselfe, nor the Duke of <hi>Clarence</hi> were reckoned very sure for the children of the noble Duke <hi>Richard,</hi> as those that by their favours more resembled other known men; but the Lord Protectour (saith he) is the fathers own figure<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aine to leave the matter, he had in hand, and out of all order and frame begin to repeate those words againe: This is the very noble Prince, the Fathers own figure, his own countenance, the very print of his visage, the plaine expresse likenes of that noble Duke.

            <p>The Tuesday following this Sermon, the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> with divers Lords and Knights came to the <hi>Guildhall</hi> in <hi>London</hi>; and there before the Major and whole assembly of Citizens, made a very solemne and long Oration, wherein he recited many grievances of the late King <hi>Edwards</hi> Government, his many unnecessary Taxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

Which Oration ended, all men stood wondring at the motion, but no man offered to speak a word. At which the Duke marvelling, as supposing the Major had prepared them before; he asked the Major privately, what this silence meant? who answered, that perhaps they had not heard or understood what it was he said. Whereupon the Duke with a more a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>dible voice repeated the same matter againe, in a more earnest and plain expression; yet neither did that move them to shew any inclination to the motion. Then the Duke whispering with the Major, It was thought, that the Citizens being used to have such motions made them by their Recorder, they would better it from him; and thereupon the Recorder is commanded to move them in it: but the Recorder (cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Fitzwilliams</hi>) being an honest man and newly come to his place; repeated one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as neer as he could the words of the Duke, but added nothing of his own; so as neither did this move the people to breake their silence. At last, the Duke seeing their resolved <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ullennesse, told them plainly, that all the Nobility and Commons of the Realme were agreed to choose the Protectour for their King, as the true and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted heire; so as he needed not to have moved them to it, but onely for the great respect they all bare to this honourable City; and therefore required them plainly to speak their mindes, whether they would joyn with them in this choice or no. At this, certaine servants of the Dukes, and other of their procuring, standing at the lower end of the Hall, cast up their Caps, and cryed aloud, King <hi>Richard,</hi> King <hi>Richard</hi>; whereat, though the whole multitude of Citizens marvelled what they meant; yet the Duke taking advantage of it, as of an unanimous conset: A good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cry (saith he) and thanked them all for their universall approbation; promising he would acquaint the Protectour with the great love they shewed toward him: and then requiring the Major and chiefe Citizens to meet him the next morning at <hi>Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nards</hi> Castle, where the Protectour then lay; there to joyn with him, in Petitioning the Protectour to accept of this their freely profered subjection; he tooke his leave and so departed.</p>

not so certaine: whether it were that the Duke thought not himselfe so well rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as his great services had deserved; or whether it were, that King <hi>Richard</hi> thought not himselfe absolute King, as long as the Duke, by whose means he came to be King, was in such a height of greatnesse; or whether it were (as was rather thought) that the Duke being a man ambitious and of an aspiring spirit; though he had himselfe been the means to bring King <hi>Richard</hi> to the Crown; yet when the Crown was put upon his head, so envied at it, that he turned his head another way, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Whatsoever it was, certaine it is, that presently after the Coronation, there grew great jealousies between them; and the Duke retired himselfe to his Castle at <hi>Breck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nock,</hi> where he had the Bishop of <hi>Ely</hi> in custody. And here we may observe the unsearchable depth of the divine Providence; the bottome whereof, the soundest judgement of Man can never sound, as working effects by contrary causes: for where King <hi>Richard</hi> had committed the Bishop to the Duke, as to one that would have a most watchfull eye over him; This which the King did for the Bishops grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter punishment, proved a means afterward of the Bishops greater advancement, and a means at the present of King <hi>Richards</hi> ruine. For the Duke being retyred home, and having his head so full of thoughts, that of necessity it required <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> he grew to delight in nothing more then to be conferring with him. One time it happened, that the Duke had opened his minde something freely to him; and the Bishop following him in his own way, and cunningly working upon that humour of the Duke, which he found most working in the Duke; which he conceived to grow out of envy to king <hi>Richard</hi>: he said to this purpose; My Lord, you know I followed first the part of king <hi>Henry</hi> the sixth, and if I could have had my wish, his Sonne should have had the Crown, and not king <hi>Edward</hi>: But after that God had ordained king <hi>Edward</hi> to Reigne; I was never so mad, that I would with a dead man strive against the quick.

               </gap>; and even there he left: saying, he had already meddled too much with the world; and would from that day meddle with his Books and his Beads, and no further. Then longed the Duke exceedingly to heare what he would have said; because he ended with the king, and there suddenly stopped: and thereupon intreated him to be bold to say whatsoever he thought; whereof he faithfully promised there should never come hurt, and peradventure more good then he would thinke; and withall, that himselfe intended to use his secret Counsell; which (he said) was the only cause for the which he had procured of the king to have him in his custody. The Bishop humbly thanked him, and said: In good faith my Lord, I love not to talke much of Princes, as a thing not all out of perill, though the word be without fault, for so much as it shall not be taken as the party meant it, but as it pleaseth the Prince to construe it. And ever I thinke on <hi>Aesops</hi> Tale, that when the Lyon had proclaimed on paine of death, that no horned beast should abide in a certaine Wood; one that had in his forehead a bunch of flesh, fled away a geart pace: the Fox that saw him run so fast, asked him whither he made all that haste? who answered, in faith I neither wot nor reck, so I were once hence, because of the Proclaimation made of horned beasts: why foole, (quoth the Fox) thou mayest abide well enough, the Lyon meant it not by thee, for it is no horn that is in thy head: No mary (quoth he) that wote I well enough; but what if he call it a horne, where am I then? The Duke laughed at the Tale, and said; My Lord, I warrant you, neither the Lyon not the Bore shall picke any matter at any thing here spoken; for it shall never come neere
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:52616:162"/>
their eare. Then said the Bishop, In good faith Sir, if it did, the thing I was about to say, taken as well as a fore God I meant it, could deserve but thank; and yet taken as I ween it would, might happen to turne me to little good, and you to les<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e. Then longed the Duke much more, to heare what it was: whereupon the Bishop said, My Lord, as for the late Protectour, sith he is now king in Possession, I purpose not to dispute his title; but for the weale of the Realme, I could wish he had in him those excellent virtues which God hath planted in the person of your Grace: and there left again. The Duke somewhat marvelling at his sudden pause, said, My L. I cannot but note your sudden stopping in your speech, so as your words come not to any direct sentence, whereby I may have knowledge, eith<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r what your inward intent is now toward the king, or what your affection is toward me: I therefore intreate you to use no more such obscurity, but plainly to disclose your minde unto me, who upon mine honor will be as secret in the case, as the deafe and dumb person is to the singer, or the Tree to the Hunter. The Bp. then upon confidence of the D. promise, said<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> my Lord, I plainly perceive, the kingdome being in the case as it is, under such a King as now we have, must needs decay and be brought to confusion; but one hope I have, that when I consider and daily behold your noble Personage, your Justice, your ardent love towards your Country, and in like manner the great love of your Country to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you; I must needs thinke this Realme fortunate, that hath such a Prince in store, meet and apt to be a Governour; in whose person consisteth the very undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Image of true honour. And then taxing the present king with many cruelties and oppressions, he concluded, saying: And now my Lord, if either you love God, your Linage, or your native Country, you must your self take upon you the Crown and Imperiall Diadem of this Realme; but if your selfe will refuse to take it upon you, I then adjure you, by the faith you owe to God, and by the love you beare to your native Country, to devise some way, how the Realme may by your Princely po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy be reduced to some convenient Regiment, under some good governour by you to be appointed: And if you could devise to set up againe the Linage of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When the Bishop had ended his saying, the Duke sighed, and spake not of a good while; which sore abashed the Bishop, and made him change colour: which the Duke per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, he said; Be not afrayd my Lord, all promises shall be kept: so for that time they parted. The next day, the Duke sent for the Bishop, and having rehearsed unto him the Communication had between them the day before, he went on and said: My Lord of <hi>Ely,</hi> since I perceive your true heart and sincere affection toward me; I will now discover unto you, all that hath passed my own imaginations. After I had found the dissimulation and falsenesse of king <hi>Richard,</hi> and speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally after I was informed of the murther of the two young Princes, to which (God be my Judge) I never condiscended; I so much abhorred the sight, and much more the company of him, that I could no longer abide in his Court; but feigning a cause to depart, I tooke my leave of him (he thinking nothing lesse, then that I was displeased) and so returned to <hi>Brecknok</hi> to you; but in that returning, whether it were by inspiration, or els<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And to make good their seditious fact, they assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled a great number, and made one Sir <hi>Iohn Egremond</hi> their Captaine: Declaring, that in defence of their liberties, they would bid the King battell.

            <p>At this time, <hi>Iames</hi> the third, king of <hi>Scotland,</hi> having by some errors of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment incurred the hatred of his Nobility and people; laboured with king <hi>Henry,</hi> as also with the Pope, and the king of <hi>France,</hi> to make an Accord between him and his people, who had compelled Prince <hi>Iames</hi> his Sonne, to be the Titular head of those Armes which they assumed against him. The kings accordingly interposed their mediations by Ambassadours; but could receive no other but this outragious answer, That there was no talking of Peace, unlesse he would resigne his Crowne. Which answer the kings protested against, declaring by their Ambassadors, that they thought it a common injury done to themselves, and that the Example was not suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, for Subjects to lift their hands against their Soveraigne.

Who thereupon sent <hi>Richard Fox</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Exceter,</hi> and <hi>Giles</hi> Lord <hi>Dawbeney</hi> to conclude them; which amongst other Articles were, That king <hi>Henry</hi> without quitting his claime to <hi>France,</hi> should for a Peace to continue during the two kings lives, receive in present of <hi>Charles</hi> king of <hi>France,</hi> for his charges in that warre, seven hundred forty and five thousand Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, which in English money amounts to one hundred eighty six thousand two hundred and fifty pounds; and five and twenty thousand crowns yeerly, towards the expenses he had been at before in aiding the <hi>Britaines</hi>; which (by the English, called Tribute) was duly paid, during all the Kings Reigne, and also to king <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> his Sonne afterward, longer then it could continue upon any computation of charges.

Which whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the king did permit, to save his own purse from Rewards, or to communicate the envy of a businesse that was displeasing to his people, was diversly interpreted: for certainly, the King had no great fancy to own this Peace; and therefore a little before it was concluded, he had underhand procured some of his best Captaines and Men of Warre, to advise him to a Peace under their hands, in an earnest manner, in the nature of a Supplication, that he might have it shew for justifying himselfe, and to give some allay to the discontentments of many, who had sold and engaged their Estates, upon the hopes of the warre.

            <p>There had been disturbance in the Realme before, by a Counterfeit Sonne of the Duke of <hi>Clarence</hi>; but that device had two maine imperfections: One, that the true Sonne of the Duke was for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h-comming, and to be shewed openly for convincing the false; the other, that though the counterfeit had been the true, yet he could have laid no claim to the Crown, as long as any Daughters of King <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth were living: Now therefore a device is found, by which those imperfections were both of them amended: for now a Counterfeit was set on foot, who pretended to be <hi>Richard</hi> the younger Sonne of king <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth; so that neither any other could be produced to convince him of being false, nor any Daughters of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> could hinder his Right for claiming the Crown. This device was first forged by <hi>Margaret</hi> Dutchesse of <hi>Burgundie</hi>; a woman that could never be quiet in her minde, as long as king <hi>Henry</hi> was quiet in his kingdome; and by this device she ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, if not to put him cleane out of his seat, yet foulely at least to disturbe him in it; and this was the purpose of the Pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hy all to be related. The Dutchesse having formerly given out, that <hi>Richard</hi> the younger Sonne of king <hi>Edward,</hi> was not murthred, but in compassion spared, and sent secretly a way to seek his fortune; and having after long search gotten at last a fit Boy to personate a Prince; keeps him seretly a good time with her; in which time she so throughly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed him in all Circumstances, and he afterward put them so gracefully in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, that even those who had seen and known the young Prince while he lived, could hardly perceive but that this was he. It is true, though he were not King <hi>Edwards</hi> Sonne, yet he was his Godsonne; and might perhaps have in him some base blood of the house of <hi>Yorke.</hi> This <hi>Perkin Warbeck,</hi> (for so was the youths name, called <hi>Perkin,</hi> as a diminutive of <hi>Peter</hi>) when he so perfectly had learned his lesson, that he was fit to come upon the Stage; she sent him into <hi>Portingall,</hi> that comming from a strange Country, it might be thought, he had been driven to wander from one Country to another, for safeguard of his life, at least that she of all other might not be suspected. From <hi>Portingal</hi> she caused him to passe into <hi>Ireland,</hi> where the house of <hi>Yorke</hi> was specially respected, in regard of the great love which <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi> Father of King <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, had wonne amongst them: by reason whereof, this <hi>Perkin</hi> as esteemed his Grand-childe, was well entertained by them, and held in great estimation. He had not been long in <hi>Ireland,</hi> when the French king sent for him; for being at that time at variance with King <hi>Henry,</hi> hee thought he might make good use of <hi>Perkin,</hi> as a pretender against King <hi>Henry</hi> for the Crown. <hi>Perkin</hi> being come to <hi>Paris,</hi> was entertained in a Princely fashion; and for his more honour, had a guard assigned him, over which the Lord <hi>Congreshall</hi> was Captaine. He had not been long at <hi>Paris,</hi> when there resorted to him Sir <hi>George Nevill</hi> bastard, Sir <hi>Iohn Taylour, Richard Robinson,</hi> and about a hundred other English: Amongst the rest, one <hi>Stephen Fryon,</hi> that had been King <hi>Henries</hi> Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary for the French Tongue; but discontented, fled, and became a chiefe Instrument in all <hi>Perkins</hi> proceedings. But this float of <hi>Perkins</hi> lasted not long; for as soon as Peace was concluded between the two Kings; the King of <hi>France</hi> dismissed <hi>Perkin</hi> and would keep him no longer. Then passed he secretly to his first foundresse, the Lady <hi>Margaret</hi>; who at his first comming, made a shew of suspecting him to be a Counterfeit. But causing him in great assemblies to be brought before her, as though she had never seen him before; and finding him to answer directly to all questions she put unto him: she openly professed, that she was now satisfied, and thought him verily to be her true Nephew; and thereupon assigned a gu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

These words being considered of, by the Judges, seemed to expresse a tickle hold of Loyalty; for who could tell how soon he might be perswaded that he knew it? and upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, was to be Loyall to king <hi>Henry,</hi> but for want of better; and withall it strook up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a string which had alwaies sounded harsh in king <hi>Henries</hi> ears, as preferring the Title of <hi>Yorke</hi> before that of <hi>Lancaster.</hi> Sir <hi>William</hi> being hereupon ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned; whether trusting to the greatnesse of his favours, or the smalnes of his fault, denied little of that wherewith he was charged, and upon confession was adjudged to dye; and accordingly on the sixteenth day of <hi>February</hi> was brought to the Tower-hill, and there beheaded: after whose death, <hi>Giles</hi> Lord <hi>Dawbeny</hi> was made L. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This was that Sir <hi>William Stanley,</hi> who came in to rescue the Earle of <hi>Richmond,</hi> when he was in danger of his life; who set the Crowne upon his head, and was the cause of his being saluted King: And could it enter into his breast, to put him to death, that had saved his life, and done him so many great ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices besides?

And yet it seemes, there was some conflict in the minde of King <hi>Henry,</hi> what he should doe in this case; for he stayed six weekes after his Accusation, before before he brought him to his Arraignment.

            <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> having gotten as much honour as the Estimation of neighbouring Princes could give him, began now to be intentive to getting of wealth; wherein he quickly found Instruments fit for his purpose, but specially two, <hi>Empson</hi> &amp; <hi>Dudley</hi> both Lawyers; <hi>Dudley</hi> of a good family, but <hi>Empson</hi> the son of a Sieve-maker. These two persons being put in Authority, turned Law and Justice into Rapine. For first, their manner was, to cause divers Subects to be indicted of Crimes, and then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently to commit them; and not produce them to their answer, but suffer them to languish long in Prison; and by sundry artificiall devices and terrors, extort from them great Fines, which they termed Compositions and Mitigations. Neither did they (towards the end) observe so much as the halfe face of Justice, in proceeding by Indictment; but sent forth their Precepts to attach men, and convent them before themselves and some others at their private houses, and there used to shuffle up a Summary proceeding by examination, without tryall of Jury; as<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>uming to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, to deale both in Pleas of the Crowne, and controversies Civill. Then did they also use to enthrall and charge the Subjects lands with Tenures in <hi>Capite,</hi> by finding false Offices; refusing upon divers pretexts and delayes, to admit men to traverse those false Offices, as by Law they might. Nay the Kings Wards, after they had accomplished their full age, could not be suffered to have livery of their lands, without paying excessive Fines, farre exceeding all reasonable rates. When men were outlawed in personall actions, they would not permit them to purchase their Charters of Pardon, except they paid great and intolerable summes; standing upon the strict point of Law, which upon Outlawries gives forfeiture of goods. Nay, contrary to all Law and colour, they maintained, the King ought to have the halfe of mens lands and rents during the space of full two yeeres, for a Paine in case of Outlawry. They would also ruffle with Jurors, and enforce them to finde as they would direct; and if they did not, then convent, imprison, and fine them.

Whereat the King started a little, and said: By my faith (my Lord) I thanke you for my good cheere; but I may not endure to have my Lawes broken in my sight: my Attourney must speake with you about it. And it is part of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, that it cost the Earle for a composition, fifteen thousand marks.

            <p>In his three and twentieth yeere, there was a sharpe prosecution against Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Gapell</hi> now the second time, for misgovernment in his Majoralty: The great matter was, that in some payments he had taken notice of false monies, and did not his diligence to examine who were the Offenders: for which and some other things <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But though by this course he got great store of Treasure, yet by it he lost the best treasure (the peoples hearts) but that he something qualified it by his last Testament, commanding that Restitution should be made of all such moneys as had unjustly been levied by his Officers.</p>
            <p>It seemes king <hi>Henry,</hi> after the death of his Queene the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> had an inclination to marry againe; and hearing of the great beauty &amp; virtue of the young Queene of <hi>Naples,</hi> the widow of <hi>Ferdinando</hi> the younger; he sent three confident persons, <hi>Francis Marsyn, Iames Braybrooke,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Stile,</hi> to make two inquiries; one of her person and conditions, the other of her Estate: Who returning him an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that they found her Beauty and Virtues to be great, but her Estate to be onely a certaine Pension or Exhibition, and not the kingdome of <hi>Naples</hi> as he expected, he then gave over any further medling in that matter.

               <p>IN the two and twentieth yeer of his Reigne, he began to be troubled with the Goute; but a Defluction also taking into his Breast, wasted his Lungs, so that thrice in a yeer, and specially in the Spring, he had great fits and labours of the Tissick, which brought him to his end, at his Palace of <hi>Richmond,</hi> on the two and twentieth day of <hi>April</hi> in the yeer of 1508. when he had lived two and fifty yeers, Reigned three and twenty and eight moneths: Being dead, and all things necessary for his Funerall prepared; his Corps was brought out of his Privy Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, into the great Chamber, where it rested three dayes; and every day, had there a Dirge and Masse sung by a Plelate, Mitred: and from thence it was conveyed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Hall, wherein it remained also three dayes, and had a like service there; and so three daies in the Chappell: Upon Wednesday the nineth of <hi>May,</hi> the Corps was put into a Chariot, and over the Corpes was a Picture of the late King, laid on Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shions of Gold; and the Picture was apparelled in the Kings rich Robes, with a Crown on the head, and a Ball and Scepter in the hands: when the Chariot was thus ordered, the Kings Chappell and a great number of Prelates set forward, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; then followed all the kings Servants in Black; then followed the Chariot, and after the Chariot nine Mourners, and on every side were carried Torches, to the number of six hundred, and in this order they came from <hi>Richmond</hi> to St. <hi>Georges</hi> field; where there met with it all the Priests and Religious men within the City and without; the Major and Aldermen, with many Commoners, all cloathed in Blacke, met with the Corpes at London-bridge; and so the Chariot was brought throught the City to the Cathedrall of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> where the Body was taken out and carried into the Quire, and set under a goodly Hearse of Wax; where after a solemne Masse, was made a Sermon by the Bishop of <hi>Rochester</hi>: The next day, the Corps in like manner was removed to <hi>Westminster</hi>; Sir <hi>Edward Haword</hi> bearing the kings Banner.

How he came to alter, and to alter to such a degree of change as he did, we shall then have a fit place to shew, when we come to the time of his alteration. King <hi>Henry</hi> having lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Bookes, that the weight of a Kingdome is too heavy to lie upon one mans shoulders, if it be not supported by able Councellours; made it his first care, to make choice of an able Councell; to which he called <hi>VVilliam VVar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and Chancellour of <hi>England, Richard Fox</hi> Bishop of <hi>VVinchester, Thomas Howard</hi> Earle of <hi>Surry,</hi> and Treasurer of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, George Talbot</hi> Earle of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> and Lord Steward of his Houshold, <hi>Charles Summerset</hi> Lord Chamberlaine, Sir <hi>Thomas Lovell</hi>

               </gap> Sir <hi>Henry VVyat,</hi> Doctor <hi>Thomas Ruthall,</hi> and Sir <hi>Edward Poynings</hi>; by advise of these Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, his first Act after the care of his Fathers Funerall; was the care to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme his Fathers Will, in marrying the Lady <hi>Katherine</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lict of his Brother Prince <hi>Arthur</hi>; to which perhaps but in respect of filiall pierie, he had not the greatest devotion; and for relinquishing whereof, he might (no doubt) more easily have obtained a Despensation from the <hi>Pope,</hi> then his Father had done, for getting it to be allowed: but obsequiousnesse to his Fathers desire, and respect to his Councels advice, so far prevailed with him, that he would not be Crowned, till that were performed, that one Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation might serve them both: and so on the third day of <hi>Iune</hi> following, he married the said Lady, at the Bishop of <hi>Salisburies</hi> house in <hi>Fleetstreet</hi>; where of many great solemnities, I will remember but this one; that though the Bride were a Widdow, yet to shew she was a Virgin Widdow, she was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired all in white, and had the haire of her head hanging-downe behinde at the full length: and then (having made in the Tower four and twenty Knights of the <hi>Bath</hi>) two dayes after being <hi>Midsomer</hi> day, he was Crowned at <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>

together with his Queene, by the hands of <hi>VVilliam VVarham</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi>; with all Circumstances of State, in such cases usuall; and then all the Nobility Spirituall and Temporall, did him Homage; and the people being asked whether they would receive him for their King, they all with one voice, cryed, yea, yea.</p>
            <p>This done, his next Act was another part of performing his fathers Will, which was to proclaime Pardons for all offences, (Treason, Murder, and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonie only excepted) and to have restitution made of all goods unjustly taken from any; and because the Instruments of such injustice, are alwayes most odious, and nothing gives the people so much contentment, as to see their Persecutours punished; he therefore caused <hi>Empson</hi> and <hi>Dudley</hi> the two chiefe Actours of the late unjust proceedings, to be committed to the Tower, and divers of their inferiour Agents, called Promoters, as <hi>Canby, Page, Smith, Derby, Wright, Simpson,</hi> and <hi>Stockton,</hi> to be set on the Pillory in <hi>Cornhill,</hi> with papers on their heads, and then to ride through the City, with their faces to the horse tailes; with the shame whereof within seven dayes after, they all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Newgate. Shortly after a Parliament was called; whereof Sir <hi>Thomas Ingleby</hi> was chosen Speaker; and therein <hi>Empson</hi> and <hi>Dudley</hi> were attainted of High Treason, and after arraigned; <hi>Edmund Dudley</hi> in the <hi>Guildhall,</hi> on the seventeenth of <hi>Iuly,</hi> and Sir <hi>Richard Empson</hi> at <hi>Northampton</hi> in <hi>October</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, and on the seventeenth of <hi>August</hi> the yeere following, they were both of them beheaded on the Tower Hill; and their Bodies and Heads buried, the one at the White <hi>Fryers,</hi> the other at the Black.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Midsomer</hi> Eave at night, King <hi>Henry</hi> came privily into <hi>VVestchester,</hi> cloathed in one of the Coats of his Guard, to behold the same: and this first yeer King <hi>Henry</hi> spent in Justs and Maskes, which were almost perpetuall, performed with great Magnificence alwayes; and sometimes with great Acts of Valour, on the Kings part specially.</p>
            <p>In <hi>February</hi> the same yeer, Embassadours came from the Kings Father in law, the King of <hi>Aragon</hi>; requiring Ayde against the <hi>Moores</hi>; in which service, the Lord <hi>Thomas Darcy,</hi> a Knight of the Garter, making suite to be imployd; he was sent thither, and with him the Lord <hi>Anthony Gray,</hi> brother to the Marquesse <hi>Dorset, Henry Guilford, Wolstan Browne,</hi> and <hi>William Sidney</hi> Esquires of the Kings House, Sir <hi>Robert Constable</hi>

            <p>In the third yeer of King <hi>Henryes</hi> Reigne, one <hi>Andrew Barton</hi> a <hi>scottish</hi> Pirate, was grown so bold, that he robbed <hi>English</hi>-men no lesse then other Nations<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In the third yeer also of King <hi>Henryes</hi> Reigne, the <hi>French</hi> King made sharpe Warre against Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> the second; whereupon King <hi>Henry</hi> wrote to the <hi>French</hi> King, requiring him to desist from his Warre against the Pope being his friend and confederate; but when the King of <hi>France</hi> little regarded his request, he then sent him word, to deliver him his Inheritance of the Dutchy of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandie</hi> and <hi>Guyen,</hi> and the Countryes of <hi>Angiou</hi> and <hi>Mayne</hi>; as also his Crown of <hi>France,</hi> or else he would recover it by the sword.

            <p>This yeer the King kept his Christmas at <hi>Greenwich</hi> in a most Magnificent manner. On New-yeers day was presented one of his Joviall Devises, which one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for a Patterne what his showes at other times were, I thinke fit to set downe at large.

These six assaulted the Castle, whom the Ladies seeing so lusty and couragious, they were contented to solace with them; and upon further communication, to yeeld the Castle; and so they came downe, and daunced a long space: after that the Ladyes led the Knights into the Castle, and then the Castle suddenly vanished out of their sights. On Twelfth day at night, the King with eleven more were disguised, after the maner of Italie, called a Maske; a thing not seen before in <hi>England.</hi> They were apparelled in garments long and broad, wrought all with gold, with Vysors and Caps of gold. And after the banket done, these Maskers came in, with six Gentlemen disguised in silke, bearing staffe Torches; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired the Ladyes to dance, and after they had danced and communed together; tooke their leave and departed.</p>
            <p>The five and twentieth of <hi>Ianuary</hi> began the Parliament, of which was spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker Sir <hi>Robert Sheffield</hi> knight, where the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> shewed the wrong which the King of <hi>France</hi> did to the King of <hi>England,</hi> in with-holding his Inheritance from him; and thereupon the Parliament concluded that Warre should be made on the <hi>French</hi> King and his Dominions.</p>

            <p>On <hi>May</hi> even this yeer, <hi>Edmund de la Poole,</hi> Earle of <hi>Suffolke,</hi> was beheaded on the Tower Hill: This was that Earle of <hi>Suffolke</hi> whom King <hi>Phillip</hi> Duke of <hi>Austria,</hi> had delivered up into the hands of King <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh, upon his promise that he would not put him to death; which indeed he performed, but

               </gap>e extreame foule weather which happened that day: the morrow after, the Emperour <hi>Maximilian</hi> came from <hi>Ayre</hi> to the Kings Campe, wearing a Crosse of Saint <hi>George,</hi> as the Kings Souldier, and receiving wages of him for service; an honour never done to any King of <hi>England</hi> before; and yet was no disparagement to the Emperour, for he was royally received, and lodged in a Tent of cloath of gold; that as no Emperour before, had ever been souldier to a King; so no souldier before was ever lodged in such a Tent. At this time the City of <hi>Terwyn,</hi> being in some distresse for want of victualls; the <hi>French</hi> King appointed all his horsemen to the number of eight thousand, to see victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls by any means convoyed into it; the charge of which Convoy was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Monsieur <hi>De Priennes:</hi> but King <hi>Henry</hi> by advise of the Emperour <hi>Maximilian,</hi> had made Bridges to passe his men over the river, to the other side of the Towne, where was easiest accesse; in such sort, that when the <hi>French</hi> Convoy came with their victualls, and thought to have entred the Towne, they found the <hi>English</hi> Army there ready to resist them; whereupon a fierce battell was fought between them: but in conclusion the <hi>French</hi> were put to flight, and fled so fast, that from thence it was called the battell of Spurres, for that they used more their spurres in running away, then theit Launces in fighting. In this battell, the Duke of <hi>Longuevyle,</hi> the Lord of <hi>Clermont,</hi> Captaine <hi>Bayard,</hi> and others to the number of twelve score were taken prisoners, and all brought to the Kings presence; with six Standards that were likewise taken. After the battell, the King made Sir <hi>Iohn Pechye</hi> Banneret, and <hi>Iohn Carre</hi> Knight, who had both of them done great service in this encounter. King <hi>Henry</hi> having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained this victory against the <hi>French</hi> horsemen, and hindred the Towne of <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyn</hi> from reliefe of victualls, and withall plying his battery more fiercely then before; made the Townsmen soone fall to desire composition, and upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that the souldiers might depart with Horse and Armour, they yeelded up the Towne into the Kings hands. This was done on the eighteenth of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust,</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> entred the Towne the same night; and set up the Banner of Saint <hi>George</hi> in the highest place of it, in signe of victory, and swore all the Townsmen to be true subjects to the King of <hi>England.</hi> The four and twen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>After this it was concluded, that the King should lay siege to the City of <hi>Tourney</hi>; whereupon he set forward in three battells, the Eeale of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi>

In this order the Kings Army marched forwards towards <hi>Tourney</hi>; by the way, he went and visited the yong Prince of <hi>Castile,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Margaret,</hi> Governesse of the Prince, in the Towne of <hi>Lisle,</hi> where with all Mag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

By which we may see, to what distresse a great Prince may be brought by a little over-sight.</p>
            <p>On the one and twentieth day of <hi>September,</hi> the King removed his Campe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Tourney</hi>; and being come within three miles of the towne, he sent <hi>Garter</hi> king of Armes to summon the towne; but they, though they had but few men of warre amongst them, yet stood upon their guard; whereupon the King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin it on all sides, and made such firce batteries upon it, that though it were written on the gates of the towne, graven in stone, <hi>Iamais tu ne as perdu ton Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellege</hi>; thou hast never lost thy Maidenhead; yet now they were glad to loose it: and in conclusion, they sent a trumpet to require a Parley, and then sued for mercy, and yeelded it up, and paid ten thousand pounds sterling besides, for redemption of their liberties: and then Master <hi>Thomas VVoolsey</hi> the Kings Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moner, calling before him all the Citizens yong and old, swore them to the King of <hi>England</hi>; the number of whom was fourescore thousand.

This was King <hi>Henries</hi> dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, that he could not forbear Revelling in the midst of his Armes; and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies must be entertained as well as souldiers. After this, finding the <hi>French</hi> not willing to come to a Battaile, and the winter drawing on, he left Sir <hi>Edward Poynings</hi> Governour of <hi>Tourney,</hi> and then returned to <hi>Callice,</hi> and from thence passed into <hi>England,</hi> and rode in post to <hi>Richmond</hi> to the Queene.</p>
            <p>Whilst King <hi>Herry</hi> was thus busied in his warre with <hi>France,</hi> the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> though his Brother in law, yet instigated by the <hi>French</hi> King, and taking advantage of King <hi>Henries</hi> absence, assembled his people to Invade <hi>England</hi>; but before his whole power could come together, the Lord <hi>Humes</hi> his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlin, with seven or eight thousand men entred the borders; but as he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning with a great booty of Cattle, in a field overgrowne with Broome, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Milfield,</hi> he was encountred by Sir <hi>Edward Bulmer,</hi> having with him not above a thousand men; who lying in that field in ambush, broke out upon him, and put him to flight, with the slaughter of five or six hundred of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and foure hundred taken prisoners, the Lord <hi>Humes</hi> himselfe escaped by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But the King was too resolute to be frighted with Phantosmes, and no warning could divert his Destinie, which had not been Destiny if it could have been diverted. The day after the Battaile, his Body, though disfigured with wounds, was knowne by the Lord <hi>Dacres</hi> and others, to be his; and thereupon bowelled, embalmed and wrapped in lead, was brought to the Monastery of <hi>Sheene</hi> in <hi>Surrey,</hi> and there interred; but at the dissolution of that House, was taken up and thrown into a waste roome amongst timber and stone; which <hi>Iohn Stow</hi> saith, he so saw; and further relateth, that the servants of <hi>Launcelot Young,</hi> Glasier to Queene <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> being at <hi>Sheene,</hi> in new Glazing the windowes, either upon a foolish pleasure, or desire of the lead, cut the head from the rest; but smelling the sweet perfums of the Balms, gave it to their Master; who opening the lead, found therin the head of a man, retaining favour, though the moisture were cleane dried up, whose haire both of head and beard was red: which afterward, he caused to be buried, at Saint <hi>Michaels</hi> Church in <hi>Woodstreet,</hi> where he dwelled.

            <p>And now the great love that had been long between King <hi>Henry</hi> and the <hi>Flemings,</hi> began to abate; upon this occasion, King <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded a match between his daughter <hi>Mary,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> Prince of <hi>Spaine</hi>: but by reason of her young yeers, and for want of assurance of Joynture, the match was deferred during his time; but now King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight seeing his sister of convenient yeers, began to call upon it, and signified so much to the Councell of <hi>Flanders</hi>; but they, whether having other ends, or out of <hi>Spanish</hi> delayes, put him off with excuses, and at last sent him word plainly, they could doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it that yeer. The King of <hi>France</hi> had soone Intelligence how much King <hi>Henry</hi> distasted these <hi>Spanish</hi> dealings, and meant to make some good use of it, for the ends he began to propose to himselfe, which were, to get the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> for himselfe, and thereby procure peace with <hi>England,</hi> being now old, and weary of the War. And for this purpose he got the new Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth to be his mediatour, and both of them send Embassadours to King <hi>Henry,</hi> the Pope to perswade him to have peace with <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King to treat about a Marriage with the Lady <hi>Mary:</hi> upon whose Embassages, King <hi>Henry</hi> partly to satisfie the Pope, and partly to advance his sister; did not unwillingly hearken to the motions: but whilst this was in working, <hi>Pryor Iohn</hi> (who knew nothing of these intentions) began again to play his Pra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This yeer the King at his Mannour of <hi>Oking; Woolsey</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Yorke</hi> came and shewed him letters, that he was elected Cardinall; for which dignity he disabled himselfe, till the King willed him to take it upon him, and from thenceforth called him Lord Cardinall, but his Hat and Bull were not yet come: after which Doctor <hi>Warham</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and Lord Chancelour of <hi>England</hi>; finding <hi>Woolsey</hi> being now Cardinall, to meddle more in his office of Chancelourship, then he could well suffer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

By occasion of this Government of the Cardinall, who under co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Justice, did what he pleased: many great men withdrew themselves from the Court; as first the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> who went and lived in their Diocesses; then the Duke of <hi>Norfolke,</hi> and at length the Duke of <hi>Suffolke,</hi> who being run deep into the Kings debt, by reason of his many Imployments into <hi>France,</hi> and his great House-keeping since his marriage with the Kings Sister, hoped the King would have forgiven it, and would no doubt have done it, but that the Cardinall opposed it, to the end the Duke should be the more at his command.</p>
            <p>In <hi>October</hi> this yeer, <hi>Matthew</hi> Bishop of <hi>Sion</hi> commonly called the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of the <hi>Swizzers</hi> came into <hi>England</hi> from the Emperour <hi>Maximilian</hi>; by whose soliciting, and Cardinall <hi>Woolseys</hi> perswasion, the King lent the Emperor a great some of money, for <hi>Woolsey</hi> being angry with the King of <hi>France,</hi> for detaining the revenewes of his Bishoprick of <hi>Tourney,</hi> perswaded King <hi>Henry</hi> that the best way to abate the <hi>French</hi> Kings power, was to furnish the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour money, the better to maintaine warre against him: and what <hi>Woolsey</hi> said, was in those dayes to King <hi>Henry</hi> an Oracle.</p>
            <p>This yeer the King kept his Christmas at his manner of <hi>Greenwich</hi>; where on Twelfth night according to his custome, rare devices with great magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence were presented; after which time the King exercised himselfe much in Hawking, which was like to have proved no good sport to him; for one time following his Hawke, and leaping over a Ditch with a Pole, the Pole brake, so that if one <hi>Edmund Mody</hi> a foot-man had not leapt into the water and lift up his head which was fast in the clay, he had been drowned.</p>
            <p>In this yeer also there happened in the City of <hi>London,</hi> an Insurrection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst strangers, specially of Artificers, complayning that strangers were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to resort hither with their Wares, and to exercise Handy-crafts, to the great hindrance and impoverishing the Kings own Subjects; and not onely so, but that they were borne out in many great Insolencies, and wrongs they offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the <hi>English,</hi> as one time it happened, a Carpenter in <hi>London</hi> called <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amson,</hi> had bought two Pigeons in <hi>Cheap-side</hi> and was about to pay for them, when a <hi>French-man</hi> tooke them out of his hand, saying, they were no meat for a Carpenter: well (said <hi>Williamson</hi>) I have bought them, and I will have them; nay (said the <hi>French-man</hi>) I will have them for my Lord Embassadour; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they grew to words, and complaint was made to the <hi>French</hi> Embassadour, who so aggravated the matter to the Major, that the Carpenter was sent to prison, and when Sir <hi>Iohn Baker</hi> sued to the Embassadour for him, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, by the body of God, the <hi>English</hi> knave was worthy to loose his life for denying any thing to a <hi>French-man,</hi> and other answer he could have none.

The eighth of <hi>October,</hi> the King feasted them at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> and at night presented a stately Maske of Knights and Ladies, with reare devises and great magnificence: The next day, Sir <hi>Thomas Exmew</hi> Major of <hi>London,</hi> feast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them at Goldsmiths-Hall, and then delivering their foure Hostages, they tooke their leave.

            <p>At this time, diverse young Gentlemen that had been in <hi>France,</hi> after the manner of that Country, carried themselves so familiarly with the King; that the Lords of his counsell thought it a disparagement to him: and thereupon, with his leave first obtained, they banished them the Court: and in their places, brought in more staied aud graver men: namely, Sir <hi>Richard Winkefield,</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Ierningham,</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Weston</hi> and Sir <hi>VVilliam Kingston.</hi>

            <p>The Cardinal had long born a grudg against the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> for spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king certain words in his disgrace, and now hath made his way for reveng: for the Earl of <hi>Surrey,</hi> Lord Admirall, who had maried the Dukes daughter, the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall had caused to be sent Deputy into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> the Dukes speciall friend he had caused upon certain suggested crimes to be Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned; so as the Duke having his friends sequestred from him, he lay now open to accusations, and accusations shall not long be wanting; for the Duke having some time before put from him in displeasure, one <hi>Charles Knevet,</hi> that had been his Surveyar, and inward with him; him the Cardinall gets to him, to see what he could get out of him against the Duke. And whether it was out of desire of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, or out of hope of reward, or that the matter was so indeed, this <hi>Knevet</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed to the Cardinall, that the Duke had once fully determined to make away the King; being brought into a hope to be King himselfe by a vaine Prophesie, which one <hi>Nicholas Hopkins</hi> (a Monke of an house of the <hi>Chartnar</hi> Order, besides <hi>Bristow,</hi> called <hi>Henton</hi>) somtimes his Confessor, had opened to him; and as for the Cardinall, that he had often heard the Duke sweare, he would punish him soundly for his manifold misdoings. And now had the Cardinall matter enough for Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, which he so aggravated to the King, that the King bid him do with him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law. Hereupon the Duke is apprehended and brought to the Tower by Sir <hi>Henry Marney,</hi> Captain of the Guard, the fifteenth of <hi>April,</hi> and shortly after in <hi>Guild-hal</hi> before Sir <hi>Iohn Brugge,</hi> then Lord Major, was indited of divers points of High-treason; the substance whereof was, that in the second yeer of the Kings reign, and at divers times before and after, he had imagined and compassed the Kings death at <hi>London</hi> and at <hi>Thornbery</hi> in <hi>Glocestershi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Letters were presently sent to <hi>Rome</hi> about it, and in the time till answer might be had, the Cardinall went to <hi>Bruges,</hi> to speak with the Emperour, with whom having stayed thirteene dayes, after most Royall entertainment, he returned back to <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Before he returned he made a new League with the Emperour, and intimated to the <hi>French</hi> King, that he doubted the King of <hi>England</hi> would not hereafter be so much his friend, as heretofore he had been; whereat, though the King of <hi>France</hi> were much offended, yet he signifyed by his Letters (perhaps dissemblingly) that he would continue the King of <hi>Englands</hi> friend asmuch as ever: onely he enveighed against the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall, as a man of no truth, &amp; withdrew many Pensions which he had before gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to some <hi>English.</hi> Presently upon this, was <hi>Tourney</hi> besieged, by the Lord <hi>Hugh de Moncada</hi> a <hi>Spaniard</hi>; and though the <hi>French</hi> King sent great Forces to succour it; yet it was rendred up to the Emperour the last of <hi>November,</hi> in the thirteenth yeer of King <hi>Henries</hi> Reigne.</p>
            <p>This yeer Pope <hi>Leo</hi> died the first of <hi>December,</hi> suspected to be poysoned by <hi>Barnabie Malespina</hi> his Chamberlaine, whose office was alwayes to give him drinke.

            <p>In this meane time, many displeasures grew between the two Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> specially two: one that <hi>French-men</hi> seized upon <hi>English</hi> ships

               </gap>, he might then with the Kings pleasure resort again to the Commons to know their meaning. The other, for the House of Commons, that if in communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and reasoning, any man should speake more largely then of duty he ought to do, yet all such offences should be pardoned, and that to be entred of Record. Which Petitions were granted, and then the Parliament began; where at first a Subsidie was demanded, but as there was much adoe in the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons about it, so there was no lesse amongst the Clergey in the Convocation House; for <hi>Richard</hi> Bishop of <hi>VVinchester,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rochester</hi> were much against it, but most of all, one <hi>Rowland Philips,</hi> Vicar of <hi>Croyden,</hi> and a Canon of <hi>Pauls,</hi> but the Cardinall taking him aside, dealt so with him, that he took him off, so as he came no more to the House<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> and then the Bel-weather (as one saith) giving over his hold, the rest soon yelded; and so was granted the half of all their spiritual yeerly Revenues, to be paid in five yeers following. The Clergey being thus brought on, on the nine &amp; twentieth of <hi>April,</hi> the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall came into the House of Commons, to work them also; and there shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great charges the King was necessarily to be at in his present Wars: de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the sum of eight hundred thousand pounds, to be raised of the fifth part of every mans Goods and Lands, which was four shillings of every pound. This demand was enforced the day after by the Speaker Sir <hi>Thomas Moore</hi>; but the Burgesses were all against it, shewing that it was not possible to have it ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered in money; for that men of Lands had not the fifth part thereof in Coyne. And further alleadged, that there be not many parishes in <hi>England</hi> one with another, able to spare a hundred Marks, except Cities and Townes; and seeing there were not above thirteen thousand Parishes in the Kingdome, (at this day there are but 9285.) how could such a summe be raised?

               </gap>e of the House were sent to move the Cardinall, to be a meanes to the King to accept of a lesser summe, but the Cardinall answered, he would rather have his tongue plucked out of his mouth with a paire of Pinsors, then make to the King any such motion. Whereupon the Cardinall came again in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o the House, and desired that he might reason with them that were against the demand; to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52616:192"/>
which it was answered, that the order of that house was to heare, and not to reason, except amongst themselves. When the Cardinall was gone, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons after long debating the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tter; at last, agreed of two shillings in the pound, from twenty pounds upward, and from forty shillings, to twenty pounds; of every twenty shillings, twelve pence, and under forty shillings, of every head of sixteene yeeres and upwards, foure pence, to be paid in two yeeres: when this was told to the Cardinall, he was much offended; so that to please him, the Gentlemen of fifty pound Land and upward, by the motion of Sir <hi>Iohn Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey,</hi> a Knight of <hi>Lincolneshire,</hi> were charged with twelve pence more in the pound, to be paid in three yeeres. The Cardinall to move them to it, bore them in hand, that the Lords had agreed to foure shillings of the pound; which was untrue, for the Lords had granted nothing, but stayed to see what the Commons would doe; whereof when the King heard, he reproved the Cardinall for it; saying withall, that ere it were long he would looke to things himselfe, without any Substitute. Which speech of the Kings, though it da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

After this, the Parliament was prorogued till the tenth of <hi>Iune</hi>; during with prorogation, the Common people said to the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesses, we heare say, you will grant foure shillings of the pound, we advise you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At this time, the Cardinall by his power Legant me, dissolved the Convocation at <hi>Pauls,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked by the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> calling him and all the Clergy, to his Convocation at <hi>Westminster</hi>: which was never seene before in <hi>England</hi> (saith <hi>Hall.</hi>) The one and thirtieth of <hi>Iuly,</hi> the Parliament was adjourned to <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi> and there continuing till the thirteenth of <hi>August,</hi> was that day at nine of the clock at night dissolved.</p>
            <p>About this time, the Bishop of <hi>Durham</hi> died, and the King gave that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprick to the Cardinall; who resigned the Bishoprick of <hi>Bath</hi> to Doctor <hi>Iohn Clerke,</hi> Master of the Rolles, and Sir <hi>Henry Marney,</hi> that was Vice-chamberlain, was made Lord Privy Seale, and shortly after, was created Lord <hi>Marney</hi>: also during this Parliament, Sir <hi>Arthur Plantagenet,</hi> bastard sonne to King <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth at <hi>Bridewell,</hi> was created Vicount <hi>Lisle</hi>; in right of his wife who was wise before to <hi>Edmund Dudley,</hi> Beheaded.</p>

            <p>About this time, the Earle of <hi>Kildare</hi> having recovered againe the favour of the Cardinall, was sent Deputy into <hi>Ireland,</hi> as he had bin before, where he reduced the wilde <hi>Irish</hi> to indifferent conformity.

And upon those Hinges did the friend-ship of these Princes turne, as at this time; the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, though not long before, he had parted with the King of <hi>England,</hi> in the greatest kindnesse that could be; yet gave not the <hi>English</hi> Embassadours so kinde entertainment now, as he had formerly done; but for what cause was not apparent, unlesse upon some sinister report made to him, by Monsieur <hi>de Prate</hi>; who having been his Ligier with the King of <hi>England,</hi> was without taking leave of the King departed, and come to the Emperour before the <hi>English</hi> Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadours came.</p>
            <p>But howsoever, King <hi>Henry</hi> being determined to make Warre in <hi>France</hi> himselfe in person, his Councell fell into consideration how the charge of the Warre should be maintained: which care the Cardinall takes upon him; and thereupon appoints Commissioners in all Shiers, to sit and draw the people to pay the sixth part of every mans substance, in plate or money: but the people opposed it, alleadging that it was against the Law of the Realme, for any man to be charged with such payments, unlesse by Parliament: and as the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall continued to presse it, so the people continued to denye it; and when some for denying it were committed to prison, the Commons in many Countryes, made great assemblies for their defence: the report whereof at last came to the King, who thereupon came to <hi>VVestminster</hi> and protested openly, that it was done without his knowledge, and that it was never his meaning, to ask any thing of his Subjects but according to Law: and therefore desired to know by whose Authority it was done. Here the Cardinall excused himselfe and said, that it was the opinion of all the Judges, and of all his Councell, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> he might Lawfully demand any summe, so it were done by Commission, and thereupon it was done. But the King liked not to take advantage of a distinction to draw money from his Subjects; and thereupon gave warning for doing any such thing hereafter: and signified so much by his Letters into all the Shiers of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:52616:195"/>
giving also a generall pardon to all that had offered to rise upon it; which though he did of his owne free grace, yet the Cardinall to win a good opinion in the Commons, gave out, that it was by his meanes the King granted the pardon.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Henries</hi> seventeenth yeer, was honoured with the advancing of many in honour, for on the eighteenth of <hi>Iune,</hi> at his Pallace of <hi>Bridewell,</hi> the Kings sonne (which he had by <hi>Elizibeth Blunt</hi> daughter to Sir <hi>Iohn Blunt</hi> Knight) called <hi>Henry Fitz-Roy,</hi> was created first Earl of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> and after on the same day Duke of <hi>Richmond</hi> and <hi>Somerset, Henry Courtney</hi> Earle of <hi>Devonshire</hi> was created Marquis of <hi>Excetur,</hi> the Lord <hi>Brandon,</hi> sonne to the Duke of <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> Queene (a child of two yeers old) was created Earle of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Manners</hi> Lord <hi>Rosse,</hi> was created Earle of <hi>Rutland,</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Clifford,</hi> was created Earle of <hi>Cunberland,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Ratcliffe</hi> Lord <hi>Fitz-Water,</hi> was created Viscount <hi>Fitz-VVater,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Bullen</hi> Treasurer of the Kings Houshold, was created Viscount <hi>Roch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>At this time the <hi>French</hi> Kings mother, as then Regent of <hi>France,</hi> procured by her Embassadours, at first a Truce, and afterward a peace with <hi>England,</hi> which was proclaimed in <hi>London,</hi> the eighth of <hi>September.</hi> By the covenants of which peace, the King of <hi>England</hi> should receive at certaine dayes, twenty hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand Crowns, which in sterling money amounted to the summe of foure hundred thousand pound; whereof fifty thousand was to be paid in hand. Sir <hi>VVilliam Fitz-Williams</hi> and Doctor <hi>Talour,</hi> was sent to the Lady <hi>Regent,</hi> to take her corporall oath, and likewise King <hi>Henry</hi> the foure and twentieth of <hi>Aprill,</hi> at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> in presence of the Embassadours of <hi>France, Rome</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> tooke his corporall oath, to observe the peace betweene him, and his loving brother the <hi>French</hi> King, during his life, and one yeer after.</p>
            <p>In this winter was great mortality in <hi>London,</hi> so as the Terme was adjourned, and the King kept his Christmas at <hi>Eltham,</hi> with a small number, and was therfore called the still Christmas. At which time, the Cardinall comming to the Court, took order for altering the state of the Kings House: many officers and other servants were discharged, and put to their pensions, in which number were foure score and foure Yeomen of the Guard: who before having had twelve pence the day with check, were now allowed but six pence the day without check, and commanded to goe into their Countries.</p>
            <p>On Shrovetuesday this yeere, a solemne Justs was held at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> the King and eleven other on the one part, the Marques of <hi>Excetur</hi> and eleven other of the other part.</p>
            <p>In his nineteenth yeer, King <hi>Henry</hi> kept a solemne Christmas at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> with Revels, Maskes, disguisings, and Banquets, and the thirtieth of <hi>December</hi> and third of <hi>Ianuary</hi> were solemne <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This Christmas was a play at <hi>Grayes-Inne,</hi> made by one Master <hi>Roe</hi> a Sergiant at Law, the effect whereof was, that Lord <hi>Gouvernance</hi> was ruled by dissipation and negligence, by whose evill order Lady <hi>Publick-Weale</hi> was put from governance.

            <p>The fourteenth of <hi>Ianuary</hi> came to the Court <hi>Don Hugo de Mendoza,</hi> a <hi>Grande</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> as Embassadours from the Emperour to the King, with a large commission, to make King <hi>Henry</hi> Judge; how just the conditions were, which the Emperour required of the King of <hi>France,</hi> and about this negotiation <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But this Banquet was one of the last of the Queenes preparing; for hitherto there had been no exception taken to the lawfulnesse of her marriage, but now came over Embassadours from the King of <hi>France,</hi> requiring to have the Kings Daughter the Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> to be given in marriage to the Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Sonne to their Master the <hi>French</hi> King, wherein they that were the suitors for it, were the hinderers of it; for amongst them was the President of <hi>Paris,</hi> who made a doubt, whither the marriage betweene King <hi>Henry</hi> and the Lady <hi>Katherin</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> having been his Borthers wife, were lawfull or no: But howsoever, the <hi>French</hi> Embassadours at <hi>Greenwich</hi> on Sunday the fifth of <hi>May,</hi> in the name of their Master the <hi>French</hi> King, took their O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But enough of small Occurrances, and indeed there will be Occurrances now more worthy to be related, but more lamentable to be heard; for now the Duke of <hi>Bourbon</hi> Generall of the Emperours Army in <hi>Italie,</hi> was slaine by a shot from the Walls of <hi>Rome,</hi> as he was passing by; upon whose death, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my entred and sacked the City, made the Pope flye to the Castle of Saint <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This said, the King rose, and the Court was adjourned to another day; for notwithstanding the Queens Appeal (from which she would by no meanes be drawn) the Cardinals continued their Session weekly, &amp; heard all of both sides: the Point that was chiefly stood on, was, whether Prince <hi>Arthur</hi> had ever had carnall knowledg of her, or no; the Kings Councell alleadged, he had, and proved it; first, by Prince <hi>Arthurs</hi> speech, the nex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But whilest Arguments were thus urged on both sides, and no certainty could appeare; the King sent the two Cardinals to the Queene, lying then in <hi>Bridewell,</hi> to

This packing of <hi>Woolsey</hi> was not so closely carried, but that it soone came to the Kings knowledge; and the King finding him a rubbe in his way, whom he expected to have expedited his proceeding, began to thinke it necessary to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move him, and to take him off from that greatnesse which had made him so presuming; and indeed he made short worke with him; for soone after he sent the Dukes of <hi>Norfolke</hi> and <hi>Suffolke</hi> to him for the Seale, which yet he would not deliver to them, till they brought him a Warrant under the Kings owne hand. When the Seale was brought to the King, he delivered it to Sir <hi>Thomas Moore,</hi> Speaker then of the Parliament (the first Lay-man that bore that Office in any memory;) and in his roome was chosen Speaker <hi>Thomas Audley,</hi> Attourney of the Dutchie. <hi>Woolsey</hi> now removed from his Chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellourship; was in the Parliament then holden, charged with points of treason; but that charge was so cleerely taken off by his servant <hi>Thomas Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi> who was then of the House, that the Cardinall was acquitted, to the great commendation of <hi>Cromwell,</hi> both for abilities in himselfe, and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to his Master.</p>
            <p>After this, the King being informed, that all those things which the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall had done by his power Legantine, were within the case of Praeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nire; he caused his Attourney <hi>Christopher Hales</hi> to sue out a Praemunire against him; and thereupon the two Dukes of <hi>Norfolke</hi> and <hi>Suffolke</hi> were sent unto him, to let him know, the Kings pleasure was, he should goe to <hi>Asher,</hi> a House neere to <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> belonging to his Bishopricke of <hi>Winchester,</hi> and there to reside: whereupon, the Cardinall having first delivered up all his Moveables to the Kings use; (the greatest store and richest that was ever knowne of any Subject) went presently to <hi>Putney</hi> by

The bill of Mortuaries, passed first the House of Commons, and was sent up to the Lords: within two dayes after, was sent up the Bill of probate of Testaments, at which the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>l the Bishops much frowned, but specially <hi>Iohn Fisher</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rochester</hi> who rose up and said; my Lords, you see what Bills come dayly from the Common House, and all is to the destruction of the Church, for Gods sake, consider what a realme <hi>Bohemia</hi> was, and when the Church went downe, then fell the glory of that Kingdome.

Now with our Commons is nothing but downe with the Church; and all this mee seemeth, is for lacke of faith onely. When these words were reported to the House of Commons, they tooke the matter very hainously, and thereupon sent their sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aker <hi>Thomas Audeley,</hi> with thirty of the House, to the King, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playning what a dishonour to the King and to the whole Realme it was to say, that they which were elected for the wisest men of all Shires, should be charged to lack faith, which was all one as to say, they were Infidels and no Chrystians, so as what Acts or Laws soever they made should be taken as Laws made by <hi>Paynims</hi> and <hi>Heathen,</hi> and not worthy to be kept by Christian men. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore humbly besought his Majesty, to call the said Bishop of <hi>Rochester</hi> before him, to give accompt of the words he had spoken. Wherupon within few daies after, the King sent for the Bishop, and acquainted him with the Commons complaint against him; who excused himselfe, by saying he meant the doings of the <hi>Bohemians</hi> was for lack of faith, and not the doings of the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; of which excuse, the King sent word to the House by Sir <hi>William Fitz-Williams</hi> Treasurer of his houshold, but it pleased the Commons nothing at all. After divers meetings between the Lords and the Commons, about the Bils of probate of Testaments and Mortuaries, the temporalty laid to the spiritualty their owne lawes and constitutions, and the spiritualty defended them, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription and usage; to whom a Gentleman of <hi>Grays-Inne</hi> made this answer, the usage hath ever been of theeves, to robbe on shooters hill; is it therefore lawfull? whilst these Bils were in debate, an Act was passed, which released to the King all such summes of money as he had borrowed at the Loane, in the fifteenth yeere of his Reigne; which Bill at first was much opposed, but the most part of the House being the Kings servants, it was at last assented to, which once knowne in the Country abroad, made much murmering, and the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be ill spoken of; for every man counted it as a sure debt, so as some made their Wils of the money, and some turned it over in satisfaction to their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditours. To qualifie which grievance, the King granted a generall pardon for all offences (certaine excepted) and was a meanes also to have the three Bils passed; one for probate of Testaments, another for Mortuaries; and the third, against plurality of Benefices; Non-residence, buying and taking of farmes by spiritual persons, though this last with some qualifying.</p>
            <p>During this Parliament, the King created Viscount <hi>Rochford,</hi> Earl of <hi>VVilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi> the Vicount <hi>Fitz-VVater</hi> Earle of <hi>Sussex,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Hastings</hi> Earl of <hi>Huntington.</hi>

            <p>This Parliament being ended, the King removed to <hi>Greenwich,</hi> and there kept his Christmas with his Queene <hi>Katherine</hi> in great state; for though this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of making void the marriage between them, was hotly pursued by the King; yet abstaining onely from her bed, he conversed with her still, and they kept Court together, in as loving manner as they had done before. And now King <hi>Henry</hi> understanding that the Pope and the Emperour was to meet at <hi>Bologna,</hi> he sent Embassadours thither, the Earle of <hi>Wiltshire,</hi> Doctor <hi>Stokesley</hi> Elect of <hi>London,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Lee,</hi> to declare both to the Pope and to the Emperour, the opinions of divers learned men in the matter of his Marriage; who all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed that it was against the Law of God; and thereupon requiring the Pope to doe him Justice; and shewing to the Emperour, that the King moved this matter for discharge of his Conscience onely, and to no other end. To which the Pope answered, that when he came to <hi>Rome,</hi> he would heare the matter dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, and doe the King right. The Emperour answered, that he would in no case be against the Law of God, and if this marriage were Judged such by the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> he would rest contented: with these Answers the Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours returned.</p>
            <p>It was now the two and twentieth yeere of King <hi>Henries</hi> reigne, when the Emperour gave to the Master of Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> of <hi>Hierusalem</hi> the Island of <hi>Maltas,</hi> in supplying of the Island of <hi>Rodes,</hi> which the <hi>Turke</hi> sometime before had won from that Order.</p>
            <p>In this yeere, the New Testament having beene Translated into <hi>English,</hi> by <hi>Tindall, Ioy,</hi> and others, was forbidden to be read; and many for reading it, were sharply punished by command of the Bishops and Sir <hi>Thomas Moore</hi> then Lord Chancellour; but none was more violent in the matter then the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> who caused all the Bookes to be brought into <hi>Pauls</hi> Church-yard, and there burned.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> having heard by good information, that when <hi>Campeius</hi> was sent Legat into <hi>England,</hi> he had brought with him a Bull of Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Another Act was then also made, that no person, should appeale for any cause, out of this Realme to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> but from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missary to the Bishop, and from the Bishop to the Archbishop, and from the Archbishop to the King: and all Causes of the King, to be tried in the upper House of the Convocation.</p>

in Lent he made great preparation for his journey, and having in his train to the number of an hundred and threescore persons: by easie journeyes came to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terborrow,</hi> and there kept his Easter; the weeke after he went to <hi>Stamford</hi> then to <hi>Newark,</hi> and so to <hi>Southwell,</hi> where he continued most part of all that sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: and then rode to <hi>Seroby,</hi> where he staid till Michaelmas and then came to <hi>Cawood</hi> Castle, within seaven miles of <hi>Yorke</hi> where he kept a plentifull house for al commers: and repaired the Castle, being greatly in decay, having above three hundred Artificers in daily wages. At last, he determined to be installed at <hi>Yorke,</hi> the next Munday after Alhallan-day; against which time great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration was made, and the Cardinall sent to the King, to lend him the Miter and Pall, which he used to wear at any great solemnity.

With that, he went and brought the Earle up, welcomming him in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plementall manner, as if he had come but onely to visit him: but being come into the Chamber, the Earle with a soft voyce, laying his hand upon the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals arme, said; My Lord, I arrest you of high treason: the Cardinall some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what astonied, asked to see his Commission, which the Earle denying to shew; then (saith the Cardinall) I will not obey your arrest; at that instant Master <hi>Walsh</hi> came in, and kneeled downe to the Cardinall; who asked him if he were joyned in Commission with the Earle; who answered, he was<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> well then, said the Cardinall, I trow you are one of the Kings Privie Chamber, your name is <hi>Walsh</hi>; I am content to yeeld to you, but not to my Lord of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> unlesse I see his Commission: the meanest of the Kings Privie-chamber is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to arrest the greatest Peere of the Realme, by the Kings commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without any Commission. Then the Earle took the Cardinals keyes from him, and put him in custody of his Gentlemen: some few dayes after, he was conveyed from <hi>Cawood</hi> to <hi>Pomfret,</hi> and after to <hi>Sheffield</hi> Parke, where he had kinde entertainment, and staid with the Earle of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> and his Lady eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene dayes; till at last sitting one day at dinner, his colour was observed to change, and being asked how he did; not well (saith he) I have something sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly at my stomacke, as cold as a whetstone, which I know is winde; I desire to have something from the Apothecary, to breake winde; which was brought, and the Earle seeing the say taken, he tooke it, and thereupon broke winde in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; but whether it were he tooke it in too great a quantity, or that there was some foule play used, he fell soone after into such a loosenesse, that the night following he had above fifty stooles; yet the next day he rode to <hi>Nottingham,</hi> and the day after to <hi>Leicester</hi> Abbey; being so sicke by the way, that he was ready to fall off his Mule; comming to the Abby gates, the Abbot with all the Covent met him; to whom he said, Father Abbot, I am come hither to lay my bones among you; and then was led up into his chamber, and went to bed; where growing sicker and sicker; the next morning Master <hi>Kingston</hi> Lie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

for I assure you, the King commanded me to say unto you, that you should be of good cheere, for that he beareth you as much good will as ever he did; No, no (Master <hi>Kingston</hi>) said the Cardinall, I see how it is framed; but if I had served God as diligently as I have done the King, he would not have given me over in my gray hayres; but it is a just reward for my study to doe him service, not regarding the service of God, to doe him pleasure; and having so said, his speech failed, and incontinent the clock struk eight, and then he gave up the Ghost; which made some about him to remember, how he had said the day before: that at eight of the clock they should loose their master.

            <p>At this time the whole Clergie of <hi>England</hi> was charged by the Kings lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Councell, to be in a Praemunire, for supporting and maintaining the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals Legatine power; and were thereupon called by Processe into the Kings Bench to answer; but before their day of Appearance came, they in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation concluded an humble submission in writing, and offered the King an hundred thousand pound to have their pardon by Parliament; which offer, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter some labour, was accepted, and their pardon promised. In which submission the Clergie called the King supreame Head of the Church. This Pardon was signed with the Kings hand, and sent to the Lords, who assented to it; and then sent it to the Lower House: but here, divers of the House excepted against the Pardon, unlesse themselves also might be included in it; who (they said) having had something to doe with the Cardinall, might be brought into the same case as the Clergie were. Hereupon their Speaker <hi>Thomas Audeley,</hi> with a convenient number of the House, was sent to the King about it; to whom the King made answer, that he was their Soveraigne Lord, and would not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to shew his mercy; and seeing they went about to restraine him of his liberty, he would grant a Pardon to the Clergie, which he might doe by his great Seale without them; and for their Pardon, he would be advised before he granted it: with this Answer the Speaker and Commons returned, much grieved and discontented; and some said that <hi>Thomas Cromwell,</hi> who was new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come into the Kings favour, had disclosed the secrets of the House, which made the King give this unpleasing Answer.

The King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, when he heard of these determinations, was so farre from rejoycing at it, that he rather mourned, as for the losse of so good a wife; yet he conversed with her as he had done before, in nothing altered but in abstaining from her bed.

            <p>In <hi>May</hi> this yeer Pope <hi>Clement</hi> sent a messenger to King <hi>Henry,</hi> requiring him personally to appeare at the generall Councell, which he had appointed to be kept the yeer following; but when his Commission was shewed, there was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time nor place specified for keeping of the said Councell; and so with an uncertain Answer to an uncertain Demand, the Messenger departed.</p>
            <p>It was now the five and twentieth yeere of the Kings reigne, when on Midso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer day, <hi>Mary</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Queene, and then wife to <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Suff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52616:201"/>
               <hi>Norfolke,</hi> and the old Marchionesse <hi>Dorset</hi> widow; and at the Confirmation, the Lady Marchionesse of <hi>Excester</hi>: the Christning was performed with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great state, and great gifts were given by the Gossips.</p>
            <p>This yeere, one <hi>Pavier</hi> the Town-clerke of <hi>London</hi> hanged himselfe, (whom <hi>Hollinshead</hi> saith) he heard once sweare a great oath; that if he thought the thought the King would set forth the Scripture in <hi>English,</hi> rather then he would live to see that day, he would cut his owne throat: which I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore relate, that the judgement of God may be seene upon such unhallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed oathes.</p>
            <p>A little before this time one <hi>Elizabeth Barton,</hi> named the Holy Maid of <hi>Kent,</hi> came to be discovered; whose abettours were <hi>Richard Master</hi> a Priest, Parson of <hi>Aldington</hi> in <hi>Kent, Edward Bocking</hi> Doctor of Divinity, a Monke of <hi>Canterbury, Richard Deering</hi> a Monke, <hi>Edward Thwayts</hi> Gentleman, <hi>Henry Gold</hi> Parson of <hi>Aldermary, Hugh Rich</hi> a Fryar observant, <hi>Richard Risby</hi> and <hi>Thomas Gold,</hi> Centlemen. This Maid had learned to counterfeit falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Trances; in which she would deliver many strange things, and amongst others, said, that by Revelation from God and his Saints she was informed; that if King <hi>Henry</hi> proceeded to the Divorce, and married another, he should not be King of <hi>England</hi> one moneth after. And here we may see how credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous oftentimes great Schollars are in beleeving Impostures, when <hi>VVarham</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and <hi>Fisher</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rochester</hi> were thought to give credit to this Counterfeit, that we need not wonder at Saint <hi>Austin</hi>; who though he gave credit to many lying Miracles, yet they were such as had more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability in them then this; which consisted in nothing but making of faces, as upon Examination of the Maide and her Abettours was confessed; and thereupon she and most of them were condemned, drawne to <hi>Tyburne</hi> and there hanged.</p>
            <p>In this meane time the <hi>Scots</hi> had beene troublesome, and made Intodes upon the Borders; till at last, Commissioners being sent to treat of agreement; a Peace was concluded, to continue both the Kings lives; which on the twentieth of <hi>May</hi> this yeer, was openly Proclaimed.</p>
            <p>About this time, at the suit of the Lady <hi>Katherine</hi> Dowage, a Bull was sent from the Pope, which cursed both the King and the Realme; which Bull was set up in the Towne of <hi>Dunkerke</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> the Messenger not daring to come neerer: and because it was knowne that the Lady Dowager had procured this Curse to be sent, the Duke of <hi>Suffolke</hi> was sent to her, lying then at <hi>Bugden</hi> besides <hi>Huntington,</hi> to discharge a great part of her houshold servants; yet leaving her a convenient number, like a Princesse.</p>
            <p>It was now the six and twentieth yeer of King <hi>Henries</hi> reigne, when in a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament holden, an Act was made for establishing the succession in the Crown, upon the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi>; to which, first all the Lords, Knights and Burgesses were sworne; and after Commissioners were sent into all parts of the Realm, to take the oath of all men and women to the said Act. Another Act was also made, which authorized the King to be Supreame Head of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the Popes authority to be utterly abolished. But Doctor <hi>Iohn Fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rochester,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Moore</hi> Knight, and Doctor <hi>Wilson</hi> Parson of Saint <hi>Thomas Apostles</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> expresly denied at <hi>Lam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Of these two Bishop <hi>Fisher</hi> was much lamented, as reputed a man both of great learning and good life. The Pope had elected him Cardinall, and his Hat was come as farr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> as <hi>Callice,</hi> but before it could come into <hi>England</hi> his head was off. Sir <hi>Thomas Moore</hi> was both learned and very wise, but so given to a vaine of jest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and merry scoffing, that he could not refrain it at the very time of his death: as when he was carried to the Tower, being demanded his upper garment (mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his Gowne) you shall have it, said he, and gave them his cap; saying, it
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:52616:202"/>
was the uppermost garment he had: also, when being upon the Scaffold, the Hangman kneeled downe and asked him forgivenesse; I forgive thee (said he) but I promise thee, thou wilt never have credit by cutting off my Head, my necke is so short: and when he was to lay his head downe upon the blocke, having a great gray beard, he stroked it out, and said to the Hangman, I pray you let me lay my beard over the blocke, lest you should cut it; for though you have Warrant to cut off my head, you have none to cut my beard. But his Devotion was no jesting matter, for he used to weare a shirt of haire next his skin, for a perpetuall pen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ance; and oftentimes in the Church he would put on a Surplesse, and helpe the Priest to say Masse; which he forbore not to doe even when he was Lord Chancellour of <hi>England</hi>; as one time the Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke</hi> comming to the Church found him doing it. Two memorable things are recorded of him; one, which shewes his great integritie, and the small recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning he made of riches; that having passed through so many great imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and borne so many great Offices; yet in all his time, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e never Purchased above one hundred pounds land a yeere, nor left any great stocke of money be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde him, when he died.

            <p>The ninth of <hi>Iuly,</hi> this yeere, the Lord <hi>Dacres</hi> of the North was arraigned at <hi>Westminster</hi> of high treason, before the Duke of <hi>Norfolke,</hi> as high Steward of <hi>England</hi>; his Inditement being read, he so answered every part and matter therein contained, that by his Peeres he was found Not guilty; a rare thing to stop a currant that ran with such violence. The one and twentieth of <hi>September</hi> Doctor <hi>Taylour</hi> Master of the Roles, was discharged of that Office; and the nin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>October</hi> following, <hi>Thomas Cromwell</hi> was sworne in his place.</p>
            <p>This yeere the King of <hi>Scots</hi> was installed Knight of Garter, by his Deputy the Lord <hi>Erskin</hi> and <hi>Stephen Gardiner,</hi> who after the Cardinals death, was made Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> was sent Embassadour Legier, into <hi>France,</hi> where he remained three yeeres.

               </gap>, fell into her last sicknesse; to whom the King sent the Emperours Embassadour Legier, desiring her to be of good comfort; but she finding her death to approach, caused onely one of her Gentlewoman to write a Letter to the King; commending to him her Daughter and his, and beseeching him to be a good Father to her; and then desiring him further, to have some conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of her Servants. On the eighth of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> at <hi>Kimbolton,</hi> she departed this life, and was buried at <hi>Peterborough.</hi> A woman of so vertuous a life, and of so great obsequiousnesse to her husband, that from her onely merit, is grown a reputation to all <hi>Spanish</hi> wives. Also the nine and twentieth of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> this yeere, Queene <hi>Anne</hi> was delivered of a childe before her time, which was borne dead.</p>

In which Office the first thing he did, was to make the young King Knight, who presently thereupon, made <hi>Henry Hobblethorne</hi> Major of <hi>London</hi> Knight, and then King <hi>Henries</hi> Obsequies being solemnly performed; on the seaventeenth of <hi>February,</hi> were raised in Honour the Earl of <hi>Hartford</hi> Protectour, to be Duke of <hi>Somerset, William Par</hi> Earle of <hi>Essex,</hi> to be Marquis of <hi>Northampton, Dudly</hi> Viscount <hi>Lisle,</hi> to be Earle of <hi>Warwick; Wriothsley</hi> Lord Chancelour, to be Earle of <hi>Southampton,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Seymour</hi> the Protectours brother, was made Lord of <hi>Sudeley,</hi> and Admirall of <hi>England,</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Rich</hi> was made Lord <hi>Rich,</hi> Sir <hi>VVilliam Willoughby</hi> was made Lord <hi>Willoughby,</hi> and Sir <hi>Edmund Sheffield</hi> was made Lord <hi>Sheffield</hi> of <hi>Butterwick</hi>: on the nineteenth of <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi> the King in great state rode from the Tower to the Pallace of <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> where the day following, he was Crowned by the Archbishop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> with all rites accustomed, in great solemnity.

In this fight the chiefest force of the <hi>Scottish</hi> Hors-men was defeated, the Lord <hi>Hume,</hi> by a fall from his Horse lost his life, his sonne and Heire with two Priests and six Gentlemen were taken prisoners, and about fifteene hundred slaine: the next day, the Protectour and the Earle of <hi>Warwick,</hi> rode towards the place where the <hi>Scottish</hi> Army lay, to view the manner of their incamping. As they returned, an Herauld and a Trumpeter from the <hi>Scots</hi> overtook them; who having obtained Audience, the Trumpeter said, that the Lord <hi>Huntley</hi> his Master, to spare effusion of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian blood, would fight upon the whole quarel, either with twenty against twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or with ten against ten, or else try it between the Lord Generall and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: the Protectour answered, that for number of Combatants, it was not in his power to conclude any bargaine; and as for himselfe, that being in publick charge, it was not fit he should hazard himselfe against a man of private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, which otherwise he would most willingly accept: here the Earle of <hi>Warwick</hi> intreated the Lord Generall, that he might accept the Challenge, and Trumpeter (saith he) bring me word, that thy Master will performe the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat with me, and thou shalt have an hundred Crownes for thy paines; nay ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (saith the Lord Generall) bring me word that thy Master will abide and give us battaile, and thou shalt have a thousand Crownes for thy paines: and thereupon, when no other agreement could be made, a generall battaile was resolved on: in the Army of the <hi>Scots,</hi> were five or six and thirty thousand men; in the Avant-guard, commanded by the Earle of <hi>Angus,</hi> about fifteen thousand; in the Battaile, over whom was the Lord Governour, about te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

was a prisoner, how he stood affected to the marriage; made this answer, that he liked the mariage wel enough, but he liked not this kinde of woing. This victory of <hi>Muskelborough</hi> against the <hi>Scots,</hi> was on the tenth of <hi>December,</hi> the very same day on which thirty yeers before a victory had bin had against them at <hi>Flodden</hi> field; so as it seems this day was fatall to the <hi>Scots,</hi> and confirms the opinion of Astologers, that there are dayes to some men fortunate &amp; unfortunate to others if they could be known. This victory strook such a terror into many of the <hi>Scots,</hi> that the Earl <hi>Bothwel</hi> and divers chiefe Gentlemen of <hi>Tividale</hi> and <hi>Meers</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted themselves to the King of <hi>England,</hi> and were received by the Prorectour into his protection: after this, the <hi>English</hi> army took many towns and Castles, and then for want of Provision, returned into <hi>England,</hi> having not stayed above five and twenty dayes in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and not lost above threescore men. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this great overthrow at <hi>Muskelborough,</hi> the Governour of <hi>Scotland</hi> would not yet be quiet; but assembling the people, made unto them a long Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, exhorting them to defend the liberty of their Countrie, and not to be daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with any event of warre. In this mean time many distractions and troubles hapned in <hi>England</hi>; partly in matters of Religion, and partly about Inclosures: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd first for inclosures, the Lord Protector caused Proclamation to be set forth, commanding they who had Inclosed any Lands, accustomed to lye open, should upon a certain pain, before a day assigned, lay them open again: and then in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Religion, certain Injunctions were set forth, for removing of Images out of Churches; and divers Preachers were sent with Instructions to disswade the people from praying to Saints or for the dead; from use of Beads, Ashes &amp; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions; from Masses, Durges, praying in any unknown tongue; and for defect of Preachers, Homilies were appointed publickly to be red in Churches: &amp; many for offering to maintaine these Ceremonies, were either punished or forced to recant. <hi>Edmund Bonner</hi> Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> was committed to the Fleet, for refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to receive these Injuctions; <hi>Stephen Gardiner</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise committed first to the Fleet and after to the Tower, for that he had preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; It were well, these changes in Religion should be stayed untill the King were of yeers to govern by himselfe: for the like causes <hi>Tunstall</hi> Bishop of <hi>Durham, Heath</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rochester,</hi> and <hi>Day</hi> Bishop of <hi>Chichester,</hi> were in like manner committed to prison, and all of them dispossessed of their Bishopricks; and that which was worse, the Bishopricks themselves were dispossessed of their Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, in such sort, that a very smal pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t remained to the Bishops that came after. And now a Parliament was held, in the first yeer of the King, and by Prorogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the second; wherein divers Chantries, Colledges, free Chappels, Fraterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Guildes, with all their Lands and goods were given to the King; which being sold at a low rate, enriched many and ennobled some, and thereby made them firme in maintaining the change: also it was then ordered, that no man should speak against receiving the Eucharist in both kindes, and that Bishops should be placed by Collation of the King under his Letters Patents, without any election preceding, or confirmation insuing; and that all Processes Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall should be made in the Kings name, as in Writs at the Common-Law; and that al Persons exercising Ecclesiasticall jurisdiction, should have the Kings Armes in the Seales of their Office: and further, the Statute of the six Articles and other Statutes concerning punishment of Lollards were repealed, and the Kings Supremacy over the Church of <hi>England</hi> was confirmed.</p>
            <p>All this while the warres in <hi>Scotland</hi> continued, and were managed by the Lord <hi>Gray</hi> of <hi>Wilton</hi> with variable successe; and now about this time was sent to him in aide, the Earle of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> with fifteen thousand men; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, in aid of the <hi>Scots</hi> was sent the <hi>Rhinegrave</hi> with ten thousand <hi>French</hi>; who entring into consul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>You heard before the alterations, now heare the troubles; for when the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions were sent abroad into the Countrey, and Commissioners appointed to see them executed; one Master <hi>Bodye</hi> a Commissioner, as he was pulling down Images in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> was suddenly by a Priest stabbed into the body with a knife. Hereupon the people flocked together in divers parts of the sheere, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Armes, and beginning to commit outrages; and although the chiefe Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendour was hanged and quartered in <hi>Smithfield,</hi> and many of his complices executed in divers parts of the Realme; and withall a Pardon proclaimed to all that would lay downe Armes, yet neither could that severity, nor this le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity restraine them from their insolencies; but in divers Countries, as <hi>Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sex, Hampshire, Kent, Glostershire, Warwickshire, Wostershire,</hi> but specially in <hi>Semersetshire</hi> and <hi>Devonshire,</hi> great assemblies of people gathered to a head; whose chiefe Leaders were <hi>Humfrey Arundel,</hi> and about six others of inferiour note, but many Priests.

            <p>Upon these demands, the King, although he knew that Reasons would little prevaile with unreasonable men; yet to discharge the place he held, he sent them in writing Answers to them all, and withall a generall pardon, if they would desist and lay downe armes. But the sedicious growing the more outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, the fairer they were intreated; and finding themselves unable to subsist with their owne estates, began to thinke upon the spoyle of Cities; and first they came to <hi>Excetour,</hi> and demanded entrance, which the Citizens refusing, they fell to set fire on the ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

After this they mined the wals, laid powder, and rammed the mouth; but the Citizens prevented this also, by making a countermine, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into they poured such plenty of water, that the wet powder could not be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. All this while, the Lord <hi>Russell</hi> Lord Privie Seale, who had beene sent downe to suppresse the Commotion, lay at <hi>Huntington,</hi> expecting more For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; whilst these Citizens of <hi>Excetour,</hi> for twelve dayes together endured so great famine, that they were faine to eat horses, and make bread of course bran moulded in cloathes, for that otherwise it would not cleave together. At last the Lord <hi>Gray</hi> came to the Lord <hi>Russell</hi> with supply of Forces; who after many conflicts with the Rebels, forced them to raise their siedge at <hi>Excetour</hi>; and thereby freed the City from many miseries: to whom the King afterward, gave the Mannour of <hi>Evyland,</hi> in reward for their loyalty.

part of them slaine, the rest fled; many were taken and executed by Martiall Law; the chiefe Leaders were sent to <hi>London</hi> and there executed. The sedition being thus suppressed; it is memorable what sport Sir <hi>William Kingston</hi> the Provost Marshall made, by vertue of his Office, upon men in misery. One <hi>Boyer</hi> Major of <hi>Godmin</hi> in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> had bin amongst the Rebels, not willingly but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced; to him the Provost sent word he would come and dine with him, for whom the Major made great provision; a little before dinner, the Provost took the Major aside, and whispered him in the eare, that an execution must that day be done in the town, and therefore required to have a paire of Gallows set up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst dinner should be done; the Major failed not of his charge, presently after dinner the Provost taking the Major by the hand, intreated him to lead him to the place where the Gallowes was, which when he beheld he asked the Major if he thought them to be strong enough; yes (said the Major) doubtlesse they are; well then (said the Provost) get you up speedily, for they are provided for you. I hope (answered the Major) you mean not as you speak: in faith (said the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vost) there is no remedy, for you have bin a busie Rebell; and so without respit or defence he was hanged to death:) a most uncurreous part, for a guest to offer his host. Neere the said place dwelled a Millar, who had bin a busie actor in that Rebellion; who fearing the approach of the Marshall, told a sturdy fellow his servant, that he had occasion to go from home, and therefore bid him, that if any man came to enquire after the Millar, he should not speak of him, but say that himselfe was the Millar, and had bin so for three yeers before. So the Provost came and called for the Millar, when out comes the servant, and saith, he was the man: the Provost demanded how long he had kept the Mill; these three yeeres answered the servant: then the Provost commanded his men to lay hold on him, and hang him on the next tree. At this the fellow cryed out, that he was not the Millar but the Millars man: nay Sir (said the Provost) I will take you at your word, and if thou beest the Millar thou art a busie knave; if thou beest nor, thou art a false lying knave, and howsoever thou canst never do thy Master better service then to hang for him; and so without more adoe he was dispatched.</p>
            <p>When this sedition in <hi>Devonshire</hi> was appeased, there rose another in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke,</hi> and that specially upon a grievance for enclosures; the Rebels had got one <hi>Robert Ket</hi> a Tanner of <hi>Wimondham</hi> to be their Leader, and were growne to a body of twenty thousand, seating themselves at <hi>Monshold,</hi> neer <hi>Mount-Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey,</hi> where they carried a face as it were of Justice and Religion; for they had one <hi>Conyers</hi> an idle fellow to be their Chapleyne, who morning and evening read solemn Prayers, also Sermons they had often, and as for Justice they had a bench under a tree where <hi>Ket</hi> usually sate, and with him two of every hund<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But in <hi>England</hi> in the meane time, an unfortunate accident happened, which beginning upon a very light occasion, produced afterward very heavy effects; whereof, though there were many concurrant circumstances, yet the originall cause was the pride of a woman, upon a point indeed, wherein the natures of women are commonly most tender, Precedency of place: the Protectour had maried <hi>Anne Stanhope,</hi> a woman of a haughty stomack, and the Lord Admirall his Brother the Queene <hi>Dowager,</hi> a Lady of great mildnesse: the neerenesse of the Husbands, gave occasion to the Ladies often meeting, where the Dutchesse would inwardly murmur, why shee being the wife of the elder brother and the better man, should give place to her, who was the wife of the younger brother, and the meaner man; this envy of hers toward the Queen, bred a malice in her towards the Admirall, as thinking the mischiefe she did to the husband, to be a part of revenge upon the wife, and though the Queene shortly after died in Child-bed, yet the mallice of the Dutchesse towards the Admirall lived still; (so hard a thing it is, for malice once setled in a womans heart, to be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) out of this malice, she put divers surmises into her husband the Protectours head against his brother the Admirall, as though he went about to procure his death, to the end he might aspire to the place he held; but certainly as misliking his government being a Protestant, who was himselfe a Papist; in this case causes of jealousie against the Admirall was obvious enough, for it was knowne that in King <hi>Henries</hi> time, he had aimed at the mariage of the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> King <hi>Henries</hi> second daughter; and now his wife the Queen <hi>Dowager</hi> being dead (and not without suspition of poyson) he fell upon that mariage a fresh, which could not be thought to tend, but to some very high aspiring end: the Protectour a plain man, and one that had not the cleerest insight into practises; whether too importunately provoked by his wife, or whither out of an honest mind, not willing to patronize faults though in a brother, gave way to accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:52616:219"/>
which is now called <hi>Somerset-house</hi>) he pulled downe a Church, and two Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops houses by the <hi>Strand Bridge</hi>; in digging the foundation wherof, the bones of many who had been there buried, were cast out and carried into the fields; and because the stones of those houses and the Church suffised not for his work, the steeple a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This Act of the Protectours, did something alienate the Peoples minds from him; which the Earle of <hi>Warwick</hi> perceiving thought it now a fit time to be falling upon him; and therupon drew eighteene of the Privy Counsaile to joyne with him, who withdrawing themselves from the Court, held secret consultations together, and walked in the Citty with many Servants weaponed, and in new Liveries; whereof when the Lord Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectour heard, he sent secretary <hi>Peter</hi> to them, to know the causes of their As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, requiring them to resort unto him peaceably, that they might comune together as friends; but in the meane time, hee Armed five hundred men, and removed the King by night from <hi>Hampton-court</hi> to <hi>Windsor</hi>: on the other side, the Lords at <hi>London</hi> having first taken possession of the Tower, sent for the Majo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Recorder set forth the complaint of the Lords against the Protectour, in such sort, that he made many inclinable to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour that side, but one named <hi>George Stadlow</hi> better advised, stept up, and in a long Speech shewed, what mischiefes had come to the City by opposing the King; and therefore gave his opinion to suspend giving aide to the Lords, at lest for a time. His advice was harkened to, and thereupon the Court resolved onely to arme a hundred Horsemen and foure hundred foot, in defence of the City; and to the letters, returned submissive but dilatory answers. After some other passages betweene the Protectour and the Lords, Sir <hi>Edward Winkfield</hi> Captaine of the Guard, was sent from the Lords to <hi>Windsor</hi>; who so well perswaded the King of the Lords loyall affection towards him, and of their moderate intention towards the Protectour, that the King was contented to have him presently remvoed from him, and suffered him within two dayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

to be carried to the Tower. In whose absence, seven Lords of the Councell and foure Knights were appointed by turnes to attend the Kings person; and for affaires of State, the government of them was referred to the whole body of the Councell: soone after were sent to the Protectour in the Tower, certain Lords of the Councell, with Articles against him, requiring his present Answer, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would acknowledge them to be true, or else stand upon his justifica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>About this time the Queene Dowager of <hi>Scotland,</hi> going from <hi>France</hi> to her Countrey, passed thorow <hi>England,</hi> having first obtained a safe Conduct, she arrived at <hi>Portesmouth,</hi> and was there met by divers of the <hi>English</hi> Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; conducted to <hi>London,</hi> she was lodged in the <hi>Bishops-Pallace</hi>: after four dayes staying, having beene feasted by the King at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> she departed; being waited on by the Sheriffes of Counries to the borders of <hi>Scotland.</hi> And now was one <hi>Steward</hi> a <hi>Scot</hi> apprehended in <hi>England,</hi> and imprisoned in the Tower, for intending to poyson the yong Queene of <hi>Scots,</hi> whom the King delivered to the <hi>French</hi> King upon the frontiers of <hi>Callice,</hi> to be by him justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced at his pleasure.</p>

To which she answered, that her soule was Gods; and touching her faith, as she could not change, so she would not dissemble it. Reply was made, that the King intended not to constraine her faith, but to restrain the outward profession of it, in regard of the danger the example might draw. After some like enterchange of speeches, the Lady was appointed to remain with the King, when there arived an Embassadour from the Emperor, with a threatning message of warre, in case his cousin the Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> should be denied the free exercise of the Masse: hereupon the King presently advised with the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and with the Bishop of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Rochester,</hi> who gave their opinion, that to give licence to sin was sin, but to connive at sinne might be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And now the King being uncertaine of the faith, both of his Subjects and of his Confederates, intended by alliance to strengthen himselfe; and thereupon sent one <hi>Bartwicke,</hi> to the King of <hi>Denmarke</hi> with private instructions, to treat of a mariage, betweene the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> the Kings youngest sister, and the King of <hi>Denmarks</hi> eldest son; but when it came to the point, this Lady could not be induced to entertaine mariage with any.</p>
            <p>After this, the Marquesse of <hi>Northampton</hi> was sent Embassadour to the <hi>French</hi> King, as well to present him with the Order of the Garter, as to treat with him of other secret affaires: with him were joyned in Commission the Bishop of <hi>Elye,</hi> Sir <hi>Philip Hobbie,</hi> Sir <hi>William Pickering,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Mason,</hi> and Master <hi>Smith</hi> Secritary of State; also the Earle of <hi>Worcester, Rutland,</hi> and <hi>Ormond</hi> were appointed to accompany them; as likewise the Lords <hi>Lisle, Fitzwater, Bray, Aburgavenie</hi> and <hi>Evers,</hi> with other Knights and Gentlemen of note, to the number of six and twenty; and for avoiding of immoderate traine, order was given that every Earle should have but foure attendants, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Baron but three, every Knight and Gentlem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And now to worke the King to this perswasion, (being in a languishing sicknesse, not farre from death) he inculcates to him, how much it concerned him to have a care of Religion, that it might be preserved in purity, not onely in his owne life, but as well after his death; which would not be, if his sister the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> should succeed, and she could not be put by unlesse her other sister the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> were put by also, seeing their rights depended one upon another; but if he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to appoint the Lady <hi>Iane,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Suffolkes</hi> eldest daughter, and his owne next kinswoman to his Sisters, to be his successour, he might then be sure that the true Religion should be maintained, to Gods great glory, and be a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Act of his owne religious Providence. This was to strike upon the right string of the yong Kings affection, with whom nothing was so deere as preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Religion; and thereupon his last Will was appointed to be drawne (contrived chiefly by the Lord chiefe Justice <hi>Montague,</hi> and Secretary <hi>Cecill:</hi>) by which Will, as farre as in him lay, he excluded his two sisters from the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, and all other, but the Duke of <hi>Suffolkes</hi> daughters; and then causing it to be read before his Councell, he required them all to assent unto it, and to subscribe their hands; which they all, both Nobility, and Bishops and Judges did; onely the Archbishop <hi>Cranmer</hi> refused at first, Sir <hi>Iames Hales</hi> a Judge of the Common-Pleas to the last, and with him also Sir <hi>Iohn Baker</hi> Chancellour of the Exchequer. And now remained nothing for the Duke of <hi>Northumberlands</hi> purpose, but that the King should dye; which soone after he did at <hi>Greenwich</hi> the sixth of <hi>Iuly,</hi> in the yeere 1553. One point of the Dukes policie must not be forgotten, that fearing what troubles the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> might raise after the Kings decease, if she should be at liberty; he therefore, seeing the King drawing on, used all meanes possible to get her within his power; to which end Letters are directed to her in the Kings name from the Councell, willing her forthwith to repaire to the King, as well to be a comfort to him in his sicknesse, as to see all matters well ordered about his person: whereupon, the Lady suspecting nothing, addressed her selfe with all speed to the journey; till being upon the way, she was advertised of the Dukes designe; and then she returned to her House at <hi>Hoveden,</hi> and so escaped the snare; by whose escape, the whole designe of the Duke of <hi>Northumberland</hi> was disappointed; as soone after will be seene.</p>

               <p>IN no Kings reigne was ever more Parliaments for the time, nor fewer Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidies; the greatest was in his last yeere, when yet there was but one Subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, with two fifteenes and tenths granted by the Temporalty, and a Subside by the Clergie. And indeed to shew how loath this King was to lay Impositions upon his people, this may be a sufficient argument; that though he were much in debt, yet he chose rather to deale with the Foulker in the Low-Countries for money upon loane, at the interest of fourteene pounds for a hundred, for a yeere. But his wayes for raising of money, was by selling of Chantrie Lands and Houses, given him by Parliament; and by inquiring after all Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goods, either remaining in Cathedrall and Parish-Churches, or embezeled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, as Jewels, gold and silver, Chalices, ready money, Copes, and other Vest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; reserving to every Church one Challice, and one covering for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion-Table, the rest to be applied to his benefit. He also raised money by enquiring after offences of Officers in great places; in which inquirie, one <hi>Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi>

Master of the Rolles, being convinced of many crimes, surrendred all his Offices, Lands and Goods into the Kings hands: also one <hi>Whalley</hi> Receiver of <hi>Yorkeshire,</hi> being found a delinquent, surrendred his Office, and payed a great fine besides: also the Lord <hi>Paget,</hi> Chancellour of the Dutchie, convinced, that he had sold the Kings Lands and Timber-woods without Commission, and had applied the Kings Fines to his owne use; for these and other offences, sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred his Office, and was fined at foure thousand pounds, which he payed in hand.

Yet this miraculous accident was not so much for the murther, as for the curses of a widow-woman, out of whose hands the said Master <hi>Arden</hi> had uncharitably bought the said close, to her undoing.

For proofe of his mercifull disposition this one example may be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient; when one <hi>Ioan Butcher</hi> was to be burned for blasphemy and heresie, all the Counsell could not get him to signe the Warrant, till the Archbishop <hi>Cranmer</hi> with much importunity perswaded him, and then he did it, but not without weeping. For his pregnancy of wit, and knowledge in all kindes of learning; we shall need but to hear what <hi>Cardan</hi> (who coming into <hi>England,</hi> had often conference with him) reporteth of him: that he was extraordinarily skilfull in Languages, and in the Politicks; well seen in Philosophy and in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, and generally indeed a very miracle of Art and Nature. He would an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer Embassadours somerimes upon the suddaine, either in <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Latine</hi>; he knew the state of forraigne Princes perfectly, and his own more. He could call all Gentlemen of account through his Kingdome by their names; and all this when he had scarce yet attained to the age of fifteene yeers; and died before sixteene; that from hence we may gather, it is a signe of no long life, when the faculties of the minde are ripe so early.</p>

               <p>IN the sixth yeer of his reigne, which was the yeer before he died, he fel sick of the Measels, and being well recovered of them, he fell after soon into the smal Pox, &amp; of them also was so well recovered, that the summer following he rode a progresse, with a greater magnificence then ever he had done before; having in his traine no fewer then four thousand horse. In <hi>Ianuary</hi> following, (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther procured by sinister practise, or growing upon him by naturall infirmity) he fell into an indisposition of body, which soon after grew to a cough of the Lungs. Whereupon a rumour was spread abroad by some, that a Nosegay had been given him at Newyeerstide, which brought him into this slow but deadly consumption; by others that it was done by a Glister: how ever it was, he was brought at last to so great extremity, that his Physicians despared of his life; and when Physicians could do him no good, a Gentlewoman (thought to be prepared for the purpose) tooke him in hand, and did him hurt; for with her applications his legges swelled, his pulse failed, his skinne changed colour, and many other symptomes of approaching death appeared. The hour before his death, he was overheard to pray thus by himselfe, O Lord God, deliver me out of this miserable and wretched life; O Lord, thou knowest how happy it were for me to be with thee; yet for thy chosens sake, if it be thy will send me life and health that I ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Of what religion this Duke was may well be doubted, seeing at his death he professed himself a Papist, when lately before he had importuned King <hi>Edward</hi> to make the Lady <hi>Iane</hi> his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour, lest the Papall religion should be restored; it seems he was not greatly of either but for other ends; a Protestant then when it was to make his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in law Queen; now a Papist, when it was to save his life (for it was thought he had Pardon promised, if he would recant. At the same time and place were beheaded Sir <hi>Iohn Gates</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Palmer,</hi> who were no such temporizers but persisted and dyed in the Protestant Religion, which they had alwayes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed.</p>

In this order they came through <hi>London</hi> to <hi>VVestminster</hi>; where in many places by the way, were Pagents and stately shewes, and many rich presents given to the Queene. The next day she went by water to the old Palace, and remained there till ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of the clock, and then went on foot upon blew cloth, being railed on either side to Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Church, where she was Crowned and Anointed by the Bishop of <hi>VVinchester,</hi> (the two Archbishops being then in the Tower) with all Rites and Ceremonies of old accustomed.</p>
            <p>After her Coronation, a generall pardon was published in her name, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlaced with so many exceptions of matters and persons, that very few tooke benefit by it; for after the pardon published, there were Commissioners as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed, to compound with such persons as were excepted: from some of whom they tooke away their Fees and Offices, some they fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>About this time Sir <hi>Iames Hales</hi> one of the Justices of the Common Pleas, who in the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> had refused to signe a writing for disinheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi>; (a fact worthy at least of a kinde remembrance from the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> now Queene) yet now, for that at a quarter Sessions in Kent, he gave charge upon the statutes of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, and King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth, in derogation of the Primacy of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; he was first committed to the Kings <hi>Bench,</hi> then to the <hi>Counter,</hi> and lastly to the <hi>Fleet</hi>; where he grew so troubled in minde, that he attempted with a Pen-knife to kill himselfe; and being afterward recovered of that hurt, and brought to the Queenes presence, who gave him very comfortable words, yet could never come to be quiet in his minde; but in the end, drowned himselfe in a River not halfe a mile from his house, the River being so shallow, that he was faine to lye groveling before he could dispatch him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And now another sprinkling of mercy came from the Queene; for the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quesse of <hi>Northampton,</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Gates,</hi> lately before condemned to dye, were now pardoned and set at liberty. The Lady <hi>Iane</hi> also was allowed the liberty of the Tower, not without hope of life and liberty altogether; if her father the Duke of <hi>Suffolke</hi> had not the second time been cause of her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</p>
            <p>About this time also a Synod was assembled, for consulting about matters of Religion; and the point specially of the reall presence in the Sacrament.

            <p>In the moneth of <hi>March,</hi> the Queene was taken with a fit of Devotion, and thereupon called unto her foure of her Privie Councell, namely, <hi>William</hi> Marquesse of <hi>Winchester</hi> Lord Treasurour, Sir <hi>Robert Rochester</hi> Comptrolour, Sir <hi>William Peter</hi> Secretary, and Sir <hi>Francis Englefield</hi> Master of the Wards, and signified unto them, that it went against her conscience, to hold the Lands and Possessions as well of Monasteries aud Abbeys as of other Churches, and therefore did freely relinquish them, and leave them to be disposed, as the Pope and the Lord Cardinall should thinke fit; and thereupon charged them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the Cardinall with this her purpose.

established, though, as some say, but with the difference of six voyces. In <hi>Iuly</hi> the Oath of Supremacy was propounded to the Bishops and others: And in <hi>August,</hi> Images were removed out of Churches, and broken or burnt. By these degrees the Religion was changed; and yet the change, to the wonder of the world, bred no disturbance: which if it had been done at once, and on the sudden, would hardly; at least not without dangerous opposition, have been admitted.</p>
            <p>During this time, a Parliament had been summoned to begin at <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> upon the fifteenth of <hi>Ianuary</hi>; and now the Queen, for satisfaction of the people, appointed a Conference to be held, between the Prelates of the Realm; and Protestant Divines now newly returned, who had fled the Realm, in the time of Queen <hi>Mary:</hi> for the Prelates were chosen <hi>Iohn White,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winchester; Ralph Bayne,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Coventry</hi> and <hi>Lichfield; Thomas Watson,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Lincolne</hi>; Doctor <hi>Cole,</hi> Dean of <hi>Pauls</hi>; Doctor <hi>Langdell,</hi> Arch-deacon of <hi>Lewis</hi>; Doctor <hi>Harpsefield,</hi> Arch-deacon f <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi>; and Doctor <hi>Chadsey,</hi> Arch-deacon of <hi>Middlesex:</hi> For the Protestant side were appointed, Doctor <hi>Scory,</hi> Doctor <hi>Cox,</hi> Doctor <hi>Sands,</hi> Doctor <hi>Whitehead,</hi> Doctor <hi>Grindall,</hi> Master <hi>Horne,</hi> Master <hi>Guest,</hi> Master <hi>Elmer,</hi> and Master <hi>Iuell.</hi> The place was prepared in <hi>Westminster</hi> Church; where, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the Disputants, were present the Lords of the Queens Councell, with other of the Nobility; as also many of the Lower House of Parliament. The Articles propounded against the Prelates, and their adherents, were these: First, That it is against the Word of God, and the Custome of the ancient Church, to use a Tongue unknown to the people, in common Prayer, and in the Administration of the Sacraments. Secondly, That every Church hath authority to appoint and change Ceremonies, and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall Rites, so they be to edification: Thirdly, That it cannot be proved by the Word of God, that there is in the Masse a Sacrifice Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatory for the living and the dead. For the manner of their Conference, it was agreed it should be performed in writing; and that the Bishops should deliver their Reasons in writing first. The last of <hi>March</hi> was the first day of their meeting; where, contrary to the Order, the Bishops brought no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in writing; but said, They would deliver their mindes onely by Speech: This breaking of Order much displeased the Lords, yet they had it granted. Then rose up Doctor <hi>Cole,</hi> and made a large Declaration con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the first Poynt: when he had ended, the Lords demanded if any of them had more to say; who answered, No: Then the Protestant Party exhibited a written Book; which was distinctly read by Master <hi>Horne.</hi> This done, some of the Bishops began to affirm, they had much more to say in the first Article: This again much displeased the Lords; yet this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so was granted them, to do at their next meeting on <hi>Munday</hi> next: but when <hi>Munday</hi> came, so many other differences arose between them, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference broke off, and nothing was determined. But in the Parliament there was better Agreement; for there it was enacted, That Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was the lawfull and undoubted Queen of <hi>England</hi>; notwithstanding a Law made by her Father King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, that excluded both her and her sister <hi>Mary</hi> from the Crown, seeing, though the Law be not repealed, yet it is a Principle in Law, That the Crown once gained, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away all defects. Also in this Parliament, First fruits and Tenths were restored to the Crown; and the Title of Supreme Head of the Church of <hi>England</hi> was confirmed to the Queen, with so universall consent, that in the Upper House none opposed these Laws, but onely the Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> and Sir <hi>Anthony Brown,</hi> Viscount <hi>Mountague:</hi> and in the Lower House, only some few of Papall inclination, murmured, saying, That the Parliament was packt; and that the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> and Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Cecill,</hi> for their own ends, had cunningly begged voyces, to make up their Party.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:52616:236"/>The Supremacie thus confirmed to the Queen, the Oath was soon after tendred to the Bishops and others; of whom, as many as refused to take it, were presently deprived of their livings. And that we may see, how incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Kingdom at this time was to receive the Protestant Religion; It is said, that in the whole Realm (wherein are reckoned above Nine thousand Spirituall Promotions) there were no more that refused to take the Oath, but onely fourscore Parsons, fifty Prebendaries, fifteen Masters of Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, twelve Archdeacons, twelve Deans, six Abbots, and fourteen Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, (indeed all that were at that time, except <hi>Anthony</hi> Bishop of Landaff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Three onely, namely, <hi>Cutbert Scot</hi> Bishop of Chester, <hi>Richard Pate</hi> Bishop of Worcester, and <hi>Thomas Goldwel</hi> Bishop of Saint Assaph, changed their Religion of their own accord; as also did certain Noble Personages, namely, <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Morley,</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Englefield,</hi> and Sir <hi>Robert Peckham,</hi> (who had been Privie-Councellours to Q. <hi>Mary</hi>) Sir <hi>Thomas Shelley,</hi> and Sir <hi>Iohn Gage.</hi>

            <p>In the seas of the Prelates removed, were placed Protestant Bishops, as <hi>Matthew Parker</hi> was made Archbishop of Canterbury, (who was consecrated by the Imposition of the hands of three that formerly had been Bishops; namely, <hi>William Barlow</hi> of Bath and Wells, <hi>Iohn Scory</hi> of Chichester, and <hi>Miles Coverdale</hi> of Exeter) and being consecrated himself, he afterward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated <hi>Edmund Grindall</hi> Bishop of London, <hi>Richard Cox</hi> Bishop of Ely, <hi>Edwyn Sands</hi> Bishop of Worcester, <hi>Rowland Merick</hi> Bishop of Bangor, <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Young</hi> Bishop of Saint Davyes, <hi>Nicholas Bullingham</hi> Bishop of Lincoln, <hi>Iohn Iewell</hi> Bishop of Salisbury, <hi>Richard Davis</hi> Bishop of Saint Assaph, <hi>Edward Guest</hi> Bishop of Rochester, <hi>Gilbert Barkeley</hi> Bishop of Bath and Wells, <hi>Thomas Bentham</hi> Bishop of Coventry and Litchfield, <hi>William Alley</hi> Bishop of Exceter, <hi>Iohn Parkhurst</hi> Bishop of Norwich, <hi>Robert Horn</hi> Bishop of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester, <hi>Richard Cheyney</hi> Bishop of Gloucester, <hi>Edmund Scambler</hi> Bishop of Peterbo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Whilest these things were done in England, the Treaty of peace at Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray continued still; Wherein King <hi>Phillip</hi> stood for the restitution of Calice to the English, as firmly as if it had been his own interest; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it would agree to no peace with France: But when by Messages he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, that his suit for marriage with Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was rejected; and that the Protestant Religion was established in the Kingdom, he then left Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> seeing she would not be his, to her self; and though he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came not presently a Foe, yet he became presently lesse then a Friend, and forbore to do any more good offices in that businesse. Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> thus left to her self, agreed with the French King, to conclude her own peace apart; and thereupon, Delegates on both sides were appointed to meet at Cambray: For the Queen of England were, <hi>Thursby</hi> Bishop of Ely, the Lord <hi>Williams,</hi> the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> of Effingham, Chamberlain to the Queen, and Doctor <hi>Wootton</hi> Dean of Canterbury and York: For the King of France were, <hi>Charls</hi> Cardinall of Lorrain, the first Peer of France, <hi>Annas</hi>

            <p>About this time, <hi>Henry</hi> King of France married his daughter <hi>Isabell</hi> to <hi>Phillip</hi> King of Spain, and his sister <hi>Margaret</hi> to <hi>Emmanuel Phylibert</hi> Duke of Savoy; at the solemnity of which Marriages, he would needs be a Tiltor himself; and thereupon commended the Earl of Montgomery to run against him, who unfortunately breaking his Launce upon the Kings Cuyrasse, a splinter thereof (his Beaver being somewhat open) struck him so deep in the eye, that within few dayes he ended his life: After whose death, <hi>Francis</hi> his son at the age of sixteen yeers, succeeded him in the Crown, having by the marriage of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> the Title of Scotland, and upon ground thereof laying claim to the Crown of England also, and giving the Arms of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, as properly belonging to him.</p>
            <p>And now begins the game of Faction to be play'd, wherein the whole estate of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> lyes at stake, a game that will hold playing the most part of her Reign, and if not play'd well, will put her in jeoparey of losing all, seeing all about her are against her, <hi>Phillip</hi> King of Spain hath a quarrell to her, for being rejected in his suit; the King of France hath a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell to her in right of his wife, which is now his right.

            <p>It happened (if at least it happened, and were not rather plotted of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose) that a Reformation of Religion was pretended in Scotland; but was indeed an incroachment upon the Princes Authority; for at the preaching of <hi>Iohn Knox,</hi> and other headstrong Ministers, not onely Images and Altars were cast down and burnt, the Monasteries of Saint <hi>Andrews,</hi> of <hi>Stone,</hi> of <hi>Stryveling,</hi> and of <hi>Lynlithew</hi> were overthrown; but it was further put into the heads of the Nobility, that it pertained to them, of their own Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to take away Idolatry, and by force reduce th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

seemed no lesse then impiety, not to give Ayd to the Protestants of the same Religion; but most of all it seemed plain madnesse, to suffer adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to be so neer neighbours, and to let the French nestle in <hi>Scotland,</hi> who pretend Title to <hi>England:</hi> upon such like considerations, it was resolved to send them Ayd; and thereupon an Army of six thousand Foot, and twelve hundred Horse, was sent under the Command of the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> the Lord <hi>Grey</hi> of <hi>Wilton</hi> his Lievtenant Generall; Sir <hi>Iames a Crofts,</hi> Assistant to him; the Lord <hi>Scroop,</hi> L.

These coming into <hi>Scotland,</hi> joyned with the Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Lords, and set down before <hi>Leith,</hi> where passed many small skirmishes, many Batteries, and sometimes Assaults: to whom, after some time, a new supply came of above two thousand Foot; whereof were Captains, Sir <hi>Andrew Corbet,</hi> Sir <hi>Rowland Stanley,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Hesbith,</hi> Sir <hi>Arthur Manwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi> Sir <hi>Lawrence Smith,</hi> and others: yet with this new supply there was little more done then before; many light skirmishes, many Batteries, and sometimes Assaults; so long, till at last the young French King, finding these broyls of <hi>Scotland</hi> to be too furious for him to appease, he sent to the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> desiring that Commissioners might be sent, to reconcile these differences: whereupon were dispatched into <hi>Scotland,</hi> Sir <hi>William Cecill,</hi> her principall Secretary, with Doctor <hi>Wotton,</hi> Dean of <hi>Canterbury</hi>; who concluded a Peace between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> upon these Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, That neither the King of <hi>France,</hi> nor the Queen of <hi>Scotland,</hi> should thenceforth use the Arms or Titles of <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland</hi>; And that both the English and the French should depart out of <hi>Scotland</hi>; And a generall pardon should be enacted by Parliament, for all such as had been actors in those stirs. This Peace was scarce concluded, when <hi>Francis</hi> the young King of <hi>France</hi> died, leaving the Crown to his younger brother <hi>Charles,</hi> who was guided altogether by the Queen-Mother, and molested with the Civill dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentions between the Princes of <hi>Guise</hi> and <hi>Conde</hi>; for whose reconcilement, the Queen sent Sir <hi>Henry Sidney,</hi> Lord President of <hi>VVales</hi>; and shortly after an Army, under the leading of the Lord <hi>Ambrose Dudley,</hi> Earl of <hi>VVarwick</hi>; who arriving at <hi>Newhaven,</hi> was received into the Town; which having kept eleven months, he was then constrayned, by reason of a Pestilence, to surrender again upon Composition, and so returned.</p>
            <p>About this time when the Parliament was upon dissolving; it was agreed upon by the House of Commons, to move the Queen to marry, that she might have Issue to succeed her; to which purpose, <hi>Thomas Gargrave,</hi> Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the House, with some few other chosen men, had accesse to the Queen who humbly made the motion to her, as a thing which the Kingdom in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely desired; seeing they could never hope to have a better Prince, then out of her loyns: Whereunto the Queen answered in effect thus; That she was already marryed; namely, To the Kingdom of <hi>England:</hi> and behold (saith she) the Pledge of the Covenant with my husband; and therewith she held out her finger, and shewed the Ring, wherewith, at the time of her Coronation, she gave her self in Wedlock to the Kingdom: and if (saith she) I keep my self to this husband, and take no other; yet I doubt not but God will send you as good Kings, as if they were born of me; forasmuch as we see by dayly experience, That the Issue of the best Princes do often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate: And for my self, it shall be sufficient that a Marble stone declare, That a Queen having Raigned such a time, lived and dyed a Virgin. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed before this time, many Matches had been offered her: First, King <hi>Philip</hi>: and when he was out of hope of matching with her himself, he then dealt with the Emperor <hi>Ferdinand</hi> his Unkle, to commend his younger
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52616:237"/>
Son <hi>Charles,</hi> Duke of <hi>Austria,</hi> to her for a husband. And when this suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded not, then <hi>Iohn,</hi> Duke of <hi>Finland,</hi> second Son to <hi>Gustavus</hi> King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> was sent by his father, to solicite for his eldest Brother <hi>Erricus</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> who was honourably received, but the Match rejected. Then <hi>Adolphus</hi> Duke of <hi>Holst,</hi> Unkle to <hi>Frederick</hi> King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> came into <hi>England,</hi> upon a great hope of speeding; but the Queen bestowed upon him the Honour of the Garter, and a yeerly Pension, but not her self. Then <hi>Iames</hi> Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> was commended to her by the Protestants of <hi>Scotland</hi>; but neither the man nor the motion was accepted. Of meaner Fortunes there were some at home that pleased themselves with hope of her Marriage: First, Sir <hi>William Pickering,</hi> a Gentleman of a good House, and a good Estate; but that which most commended him, was his studiousnesse of good letters, and sweet demeanour. Then <hi>Henry,</hi> Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> exceeding rich, but now in his declining age. Then <hi>Robert Dudley,</hi> youngest son of the Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> of an excellent feature of face, and now in the flower of his age: but these might please themselves with their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit; but were not considerable in her apprehension: they might receive from her good Testimonies of her Princely favour; but never Pledges of Nuptiall love.</p>
            <p>About this time the Earl of <hi>Feria</hi> (who had married the daughter of Sir <hi>William Dormer</hi>) being denyed leave of the Queen for some of his wives friends to live out of <hi>England,</hi> grew so incensed, that he made means to <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth, then Pope, to have her excommunicate, as an Heretick and Usurper: but the Pope inclining rather to save then to destroy; and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that gentle courses prevail more with generous mindes, then roughnesse and violence; in most loving manner wrote unto her, exhorting her to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the Unity of the Catholike Church; and as it is said, made her great offers, if she would hearken to his counsell; Particularly, That he would recall the Sentence pronounced against her mothers Marriage; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Book of Common Prayer in English; and permit to her people the use of the Sacrament in both Kindes. But Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> neither ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified with the Earl of <hi>Feria</hi>'s practises, nor allured with the Popes great offers, according to her Motto, <hi>Semper Eadem,</hi> persisted constant in her resolution, To maintain that Religion, which in her conscience she was perswaded, to be most agreeable to the Word of God, and most consonant to the Primitive Church.</p>
            <p>Whilst these grounds of Troubles are sowing in <hi>England, France,</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> it is not likely that <hi>Ireland</hi> will lie fallow; though indeed it be a Countrey that will bring forth Troubles of it self, without sowing: but howsoever, to make the more plentifull Harvest of troubles at this time, <hi>Iohn Oneal</hi> (whose father King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth made Earl of <hi>Tyrone</hi>) to prevent the punishment of a private Out-rage upon a Brother, broke into open Rebellion against the Prince: and though his attempts were maturely made frustrate by timely opposition; yet this was he that in the beginning of the Queens Raign, sowed the seeds of that trouble in <hi>Ireland</hi>; which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward took so deep root, that till the ending of her Raign it could never thorowly be rooted out: though this man a yeer or two after came into <hi>England,</hi> and casting himself at the Queens feet, acknowledged his fault, and obtained pardon.</p>
            <p>The Treaty of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> should by promise have been confirmed by <hi>Francis</hi> the French King while he lived: he not having done it, Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> requires his Dowager the Queen of Scots to confirm it: but she solicited often to it by <hi>Throgmorton</hi> the Queens Ligier in <hi>France</hi>; made al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes answer, She could not do it without the counsell of her Nobility in <hi>Scotland:</hi> whereupon Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> suspecting that this answer was but to hold her in amuzement, while some mischief was practising against
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52616:238"/>
her, sent Sir <hi>Thomas Randoll</hi> into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to perswade the Lords there to enter into a League of mutuall amity with her, and other Protestant Princes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> and further, by no means to permit their Queen, now a widow, to marry again to any forraign Prince; for which she alleadged many great reasons. In the mean while, the Queen of Scots, purposing to return into <hi>Scotland,</hi> sent before-hand <hi>D'Oysette</hi> a French Lord, to intreat Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that with her leave, she her self might passe by Sea into <hi>Sco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>land,</hi> and <hi>D'Oysette</hi> might passe by Land. But Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> openly denyed both the one and the other, unlesse she would confirm the Treaty of <hi>Edinburgh</hi>; saying, It was no reason she should do the Queen of Scots courtesie, if the Queen of Scots would not do her right. The Queen of Scots much troubled with this answer, expostulates the matter with her Ligier <hi>Throgmorton,</hi> and much complains of the unkindenesse: but in the mean time providing Shipping, she loosed from <hi>Calice</hi>; and under covert of a mist, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Ships were laid to intercept her, she arrived safe in <hi>Scotland</hi>; where she intreated her subjects in so loving a manner, that she gave great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment to the whole Kingdom; as well to the Protestant Party, as the other: and then sent Letters to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> proferring all observance and readinesse to enter League with her; so she might by Authority of Parliament be declared her Successor; which was but her Right. To this Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> answered, That though she would no way derogate from her Right: yet she should be loth to endanger her own security, and as it were to cover her own eyes with a Grave-cloth while she was alive; but fell again to her old Admonition, requiring her to confirm the Treaty of <hi>Edinburgh</hi>: And now to shew the respect she bore her, when her Unkles the Dukes <hi>D'A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>These two Queens indeed were both of great Spirits, and both very wise; but these grew such Jealousies of State between them; (the Queen of Scots doubting lest Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> meant to frustrate her Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession; Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> doubting lest the Queen of Scots meant to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent her succession) that it kept them more asunder in love, then they were neer in blood, and was cause of many unkinde passages between them: in all which, though the Queen of Scots were a very neer Match to the Queen of <hi>England</hi> in the abilities of her minde; yet in the favours of Fortune she was much her inferiour.</p>
            <p>But now for all the courtesie which Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> shewed to the Queen of Scots Unkles at their returning thorow <hi>England,</hi> yet new practises were again set on foot against her at <hi>Rome</hi>; the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> especially labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to have her be Excommunicate; but Pope <hi>Pius</hi> still averse from such roughnesse, meant now to try the Queen another way; and thereupon sent the Abbot <hi>Martinengi</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and when he might not be admitted to enter <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> then caused the Bishop of <hi>Viterbo</hi> his Nuntio in <hi>France,</hi> to deal earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the Queens Ligier <hi>Throgmorton,</hi> that she (as other Princes had done) would send her Orators to the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> which he before had cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. But the Queen nothing tender in this point, made peremptory an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, That a Popish Assembly she did not acknowledge to be a Generall Councell; nor did think the Pope to have any more Right or Power to call it, then any other Bishop. This Answer not only exasperated the Pope, but so alienated also the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s minde from her, that he was never after so kinde a friend to her as he had been; and none of her Embassadours ever after had any great liking to be employed to him. And now at this time, as the Abbot <hi>Martinengi</hi> was the last Nuntio that ever was sent from the Pope into <hi>England,</hi> so Sir <hi>Edward Carne,</hi> now dying at <hi>Rome,</hi> was the last Ligie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:52616:238"/>And now Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> knowing well that she had drawn many ill willers against her State, she endeavoured to strengthen it by all the means she could devise: She caused many great Ordnance of Brasse and Iron to be cast; She repaired Fortifications in the Borders of <hi>Scotland</hi>; She encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the number of her Ships, so as <hi>England</hi> never had such a Navy before; She provided great store of Armour and Weapons out of <hi>Germany</hi>; she caused Musters to be held, and youth to be trayned in exercises of Artillery; and to please the people (whose love is the greatest strength of all) she gave leave to have Corn and Grayn transported; and called in all base Coyns and Brasse Money.</p>
            <p>It was now the Fifth yeer of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Raine: when diverse great persons were called in question: <hi>Margaret</hi> Countesse of <hi>Lenox,</hi> Neece to to King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, by his eldest sister, and her husband the Earle of <hi>Lenox,</hi> for having had secret conference, by letters with the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> were delivered prisoners to Sir Richard <hi>Sackvile,</hi> Master of the Rolles, and with him kept a while in custody. Also <hi>Arthur Poole</hi> and his brother, whose great grand-father, was <hi>George</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarnce,</hi> brother to King <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth: <hi>Antony Fortescue,</hi> who had married their sister, and other, were arraigned, for conspiring to withdraw themselves to the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> in France; and from thence to return with an Army into <hi>Wales</hi>; to Declare the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> Queen of <hi>England</hi>; and <hi>Arthur Poole</hi> Duke of <hi>Clearnce</hi>; which particulars they confessed at the Barre, and were thereupon condemned to die; but had their lives spared, in regard they were of the Blood Royall.

And hereupon the Duke of <hi>Memorancy</hi> sent a Trumpetter to the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> commanding him yeeld the Town; who making an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer by Sir <hi>Hugh Pawlet,</hi> That he would never yeeld it without the Queens leave: he thereupon besieged the Town, and with great violence of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, sought to get it by force: Which Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> hearing, she sent a Commission to the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> to yeeld it up, if upon honourable Conditions; which soon after was accordingly done, after the English had held it eleven months; and then the Earl, without any dishonour for yeelding up a Town, which the Pestilence made him no lesse unwilling then unable to hold, he returned into <hi>England:</hi> but that which was more dolefull then the losse of <hi>Newhaven,</hi> he brought the Pestilence with him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>England.</hi> The recovery of this Town not onely made the French to triumph, but hereupon the Chancellor of <hi>France</hi> pronounced openly, That by this Warre, the English had lost all their Right to <hi>Calice,</hi> and were not to require it any more, seeing it was one of the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, That neither of the Nations should make Warre upon the other; which was the Point stood upon by the King of <hi>France</hi> and his mother, when Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> sent Sir <hi>Thomas Smith</hi> to demand <hi>Calice</hi> to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored.</p>
            <p>At this time there were such crosse designes amongst the Princes of Christendome, that a very good Polititian could hardly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand their Ayms. The Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> being slain in the Civill Warre, the Queen of Scots Dowry was not paid her in <hi>France,</hi> and the Scots were put off from being the Kings Guard: This exceedingly displeased the Queen of Scots: but then to please her again<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Austria,</hi> offering her for her Dowry the County of <hi>Tyroll.</hi> The Queen of Scots, to make use of her Unkles fear, and perhaps to bring Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> into an opinion of depending upon her, acquaints her with this moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and therein requires her advice. Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> not willing she should marry with any forraign Prince, perswades her to take a husband out of <hi>England,</hi> and particularly commended to her the Lord <hi>Robert Dudley</hi> (whose wife a little before had with a fall broke her neck) promising withall, that if she would marry him, she should then by Authority of Parliament, be declared her successour, in case she dyed without issue. But when her Unkles and the Queen-Mother were informed of this motion, they so much disdained the Marriage with <hi>Dudley,</hi> that so she would refuse that Match, and perseverein the friendship of the French, they offered to pay her the Dowry money that was behinde, and to restore the Scots to all their former liberties in <hi>France.</hi> And as for the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> he had indeed a Ligier Embassadour here in <hi>England</hi>; but rather by way of complement, and to watch advantages, then for any sincere love; which he began now to withdraw from the English, as suspecting them to intend a Trade to the West Indies.</p>
            <p>And now the French Protestants may see what they brought upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, by leaving the English at <hi>Newhaven,</hi> and by trusting to their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men the French Papists; for their peace was but a snare, and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> Prince of <hi>Navarre,</hi> with <hi>Margaret</hi> of <hi>Valois,</hi> the French Kings sister, was but a bait to entrap them; for upon the confidence of this Marriage, being drawn together into <hi>Paris,</hi> they were the readier for the slaughter; and a few dayes after the Marriage, which were all spent in Feasts and Masks, to make them the more secure, upon a Watch-word gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the bloody faction fell upon the Protestants, and neither spared age, nor sex, nor condition, but without mercy, and sense of humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, slaughtered as many as they could meet with, to the number of many thousands.</p>
            <p>It was now the sixth yeer of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Raign, a yeer fatall for the death of many great Personages: First died <hi>William,</hi> Lord <hi>Grey</hi> of <hi>We<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>And now Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> finding how fickle the French Protestants had carryed themselves towards her, intended to make a Peace; and to that end sent Sir <hi>Thomas Smith</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> joyning <hi>Throgmorton</hi> in Commission with him; and in conclusion a Peace was agreed on; whereof, amongst o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Articles, this was one, That the Hostages in <hi>England</hi> should be freed, upon the payment of six hundred thousand Crowns: and this Peace was ratified by the Oath both of the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> and the King of <hi>France.</hi>

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52616:240"/>
were sent to <hi>Bruges</hi> in <hi>Flanders</hi>; who, after many interruptions, brought the matter at last to some indifferent agreement.</p>
            <p>It was now the seventh yeer of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>; when making a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse, she went to see <hi>Cambridge</hi>; where after she had viewed the Colledges, and been entertained with Comedies, and Scholasticall Disputations, she made her self a Latine Oration, to the great encouragement of the Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and then returned. Presently after her return<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> she made the Lord <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Dudley</hi> Master of her Horse, first Baron of <hi>Denbigh</hi> (giving him <hi>Denbigh</hi> and all the Lands belonging to it) and then Earl of <hi>Leicester,</hi> to him, and the heirs males of his body lawfully begotten: which Honour was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon him with the greatest State and Solemnity that was ever known. And now <hi>Leicester,</hi> to endear himself to the Queen of Scots, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused Sir <hi>Nicholas Bacon,</hi> Lord Keeper, for being privy to the libell of <hi>Hales,</hi> who affirmed the Right of the Crown to belong to the Family of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> in case the Queen should die without Issue; and thereupon was <hi>Bacon</hi> cast into prison; till afterward, upon his purgation, and the mediation of Sir <hi>William Cecill,</hi> he was set at liberty, and restored to his place.</p>
            <p>And now for a while we must cast our eyes upon <hi>Scotland,</hi> for that was now the Stage where all the great businesses of State were acted: <hi>Matthew Steward,</hi> Earl of <hi>Lenox,</hi> who had marryed <hi>Margaret Dowglas,</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth's Neece by his eldest sister, had been kept as an Exile in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> now twenty yeers; him the Queen of Scots invites to come into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>

            <p>We may now leave <hi>Scotland</hi> a while, and see the Honour done at this time to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> not much inferiour to the Honour done to <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> by the Queen of <hi>Saba</hi>; for now <hi>Cecile,</hi> the sister of <hi>Errick</hi> King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and wife of <hi>Christopher</hi> Marquesse of <hi>Baden,</hi> being great with childe, came from the farthest part of the North (a long Journey) thorow <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> of purpose to see her, for the great fame she had heard of her Wisedom: At her being here, she was delivered of a childe, to whom, in requitall of her kindenesse, Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was God-mother, and named him <hi>Edwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At this time also, for the great Fame of her wisedome, <hi>Donald mac Carty More,</hi> a great Potentate of <hi>Ireland,</hi> came and delivered up into her hands all his most ample Territories; and then recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them again from her, to hold them to him and his Heirs males law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully begotten; and for want of such Issue, to remain to the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> The Queen in requitall, invested him with the honour of Earl of <hi>Glenkarne,</hi> and Baron of <hi>Valence</hi>; and besides many Presents given him, paid the charges of his Journey.</p>
            <p>It was now the eighth yeer of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Raign; when Sir <hi>Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las Arnold,</hi> a Knight of <hi>Gloucestershire,</hi> Governing <hi>Ireland</hi> under the title of a Justice, was called home, and Sir <hi>Henry Sidney</hi> placed in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And here by the way it is to be noted, That the Governours of <hi>Ireland,</hi> after it came under the English, were at first called Justices of <hi>Ireland</hi>; afterwards, Lievtenants; and their Vice-gerents were called Deputies. Afterwards at the Princes pleasure, sometimes Deputies, sometimes Justices, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Lievtenants; which last Title, though it be of greatest honour, yet in power is in a manner but the same.

               </gap> by reason of strife between <hi>Gyrald</hi> Earl of <hi>Desmond,</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi> Earl of <hi>Ormond:</hi> whereupon the Queen sending for the Earl of <hi>Desmond</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> ordained a new Government in that Province, appointing a President to administer Justice, together with an Assistant on the Bench; two Lawyers and a Notary: and the first President she made in this place, was Sir <hi>William Sent-leger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in a Progresse went to <hi>Oxford</hi>; where she took pleasure in viewing the Colledges, in hearing Orations, in seeing of Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, till the Comedy of <hi>Palemon</hi> and <hi>Arcett</hi> turned to a Tragedy, for by the fall of a wall, through the multitude of people that pressed in to see it; three men were slain. At her coming away, she made an Oration in Latine to the Schollars, a sufficient recompence for all the Orations they had made to her. And this yeer, was a call of seven new Serjeants at Law, who kept their Feast at Grayes Inne in Holborn.</p>

withall, to declare a Successor in the Crown, if she should happen to die without Issue; for which he gave many reasons, declaring what mischiefs were likely to befall the Kingdom, if she should die before a Successor were designed.

The Queen was contented to bear with words spoken in Parliament; which spoken out of Parliament, she would never have endured: but not willing to expostulate the matter with the whole number, she commanded that thirty of the Higher House, and as many of the Lower, should appear before her, to whom she delivered her minde to this effect; That she knew what danger hangeth over a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces head, when a Successor is once declared; she knew that even children themselves, out of a hastie desire of bearing Rule, had taken up Armes against their own fathers; and how could better conditions be expected from kindred? She had by reading observed, That Successors in a collate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Line, have seldom been declared; and that <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Orleance,</hi> and <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> of <hi>Angoulesme</hi> were never declared Successors, and yet obtained the Crown without any noyse. Lastly, she said, Though I have been content to let you debate the matter of Succession, yet I advise you to beware, that you be not injurious to your Princes patience. With these and the like reasons she gave so good satisfaction, that they never after troubled her with making any more such motion. And though she consented not in plain tearms to declare a Successor, yet soon after she gave some intimation of it; for one <hi>Thornton,</hi> a Reader of the Civill Law in <hi>London,</hi> who in his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, called the Queen of Scots Right in question, was clapped up in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for his labour.</p>

            <p>And now to return to the Affairs of <hi>Scotland</hi>: The nineteenth of <hi>Iune</hi> last past, the Queen of Scots, in a happy hour, was at <hi>Edinborough</hi> Castle dilive<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed of a Son, that was afterward <hi>Iames</hi> the sixth of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the first Monarch of <hi>Great Britain</hi>; whereof she presently sent word to Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> by <hi>Iames Melvyne</hi>; who thereupon sent Sir <hi>Henry Killigrew</hi> to congratulate her safe deliverance, and her young son, with all demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of love and amity. But now the love of the Queen of Scots to her husband the Lord <hi>Darly,</hi> was not so hot at first, but it was now grown to be as cold; and she had not heaped honour on him so fast before, but now as fast she taketh them off: for where before in all publike Acts, she had used to place her husbands name first, now she caused it to be placed last, and in the coyning of money began to leave it quite out.</p>
            <p>This unkindenesse between them was fomented by one <hi>David Rizie</hi> an Italian, whom the Queen had taken into her service, first, as a Musician, and then taking a liking to him, made him here Secretary for the French Tongue; by means whereof, he had oftentimes secret conference with her, when the King her Husband might not be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. This indignity the King himself, being given to his pleasures of

Hunting and Hawking, resented not so much, as some Lords that were his fri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nds; who told him plainly, That it stood not with his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to suffer this fellow to live. By whose instigation the King drawn to plot his death; One day, taking with him the Earl of <hi>Reuven,</hi> and other, he rushed into the Queens Chamber at her Supper time, where finding <hi>David Rizie</hi> at a Cupboord, tasting some meat that had been taken from the Table, he seized upon him, dragged him forth into an outer Chamber, and there murthered him; the Queen at that time being great with childe, and like by that affright to have mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carryed: But the Fact being done, the King came in to her again, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring her there was no hurt at all intended to her Person. The man that had animated the King to do this fact, was especially the Earl <hi>Murray,</hi> of whom it is necessary to say something, because his part will be the greatest of all the Scottish Actions of this time. He was the base sonne of King <hi>Iames</hi> the fifth, and so the base brother of the Queen; made at first, Prior of Saint <hi>Andrewes:</hi> But not liking that Religious Title, he affected rather some Temporall Honour; which when the Queen, being then in <hi>France,</hi> denyed him, then in an angry mood returned into <hi>Scotland,</hi> where, by the advice of <hi>Knox,</hi> whom he held for a great Patriark, brought the matter so to passe, that in an Assembly of the States, the Religion was altered, and the French were banished out of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Yet afterward, as soon as the Queen was a Widow, he posted into <hi>France,</hi> and so insinuated with her, that she created him Earl of <hi>Murray,</hi> and promoted him to an Honourable Marriage. Being thus exalted, he returned into <hi>Scotland</hi>; where, for the further growth of his ambitious designes, he sowed seeds of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, affirming often, what a misery it was to be under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of a woman; and that Royalty was not to be tyed to any Stock or Kindred, but to Vertue onely, whether the parties were legitimaie or no; by this course making way to the Kingdom for himself. To this end, he used all the mea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s he could to keep the Queen from marrying again; which when he could not effect, he then sought wayes how to make discord between her and her Husband; for which cause he had caused the King to murther <hi>Rizie.</hi> Of the foulnesse of which Fact, when the King had a while grew sensible, he meant to be revenged of <hi>Murray,</hi> who had counselled him to do it: which <hi>Murray</hi> understanding, prevented it with causing the like to be done to him, as will presently be seen. For the Queen having been delivered of a Son, and the day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the Christning being come; where the God-fathers were <hi>Charles</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Philibert</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>; Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing requested to be God-mother, sent thither the Earl of <hi>Bedford</hi> as her Deputy, and a Font of Massie Gold for a Present, in value 1043 <hi>l.</hi> but gave him expresse Command, That he should not honour <hi>Darly</hi> with the Title of King. But before a month or two, after the Christning were passed, The King in a stormy and tempestuous night, was strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in his Bed, and then cast forth into the Garden, and the house imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately blown up with Gun-powder.</p>
            <p>The rumour of this murther being spread abroad, the common Fame laid it upon <hi>Murray</hi> and <hi>Morton,</hi> and their Confederates; <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray</hi> and <hi>Morton</hi> upon the Queen: But we must not here give ear to that which BUCHANAN writes; who to curry favour with the Earl MURRAY, layes most impudent scandalls upon the Queene; whereof, before his death, he repented himself ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely. The King thus murthered, and the QUEENE left alone to her self, she is counselled to marry with some, that might be able to assist her against all her opposites: <hi>IAMES

Hepburn</hi> Earl of Bothwell being then greatly in her favour, and of great eminencie for his valour: And though he were the man that had acted the murther, yet is he by <hi>Murray</hi> and his confederates, commended to the Queen; to which motion, as being destitute of friends, and not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whom to trust; she at last consents, but upon these conditions, That above all things, respect might be had to her yong Sonne; and that <hi>Bothwell</hi> might be legally quitted, both from the bond of his former marriage, and also of the Kings murther. Hereupon a course is plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by which, <hi>Bothwell</hi> is called to the Barre; and <hi>Morton</hi> being his Advocate, by the Sentence of Judges he is cleerly acquitted. Upon this, he is created Duke of Orken<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d in a very homely garment, they thrust into prison in Loch-levyn, under the custody of <hi>Murray's</hi> mother, who had been the Harlot of King <hi>Iames</hi> the fifth; but boasting her self to have been his lawfull wife, and her son, his lawfull Issue. Queen <hi>Elisabeth</hi> having at length notice hereof, sent Sir <hi>Nicholas Throgmorton</hi> into Scotland, to expostulate with the Confederates, touching this insolent usage of the Queen; and to consult, by what means shee might be restored to her liberty. But <hi>Throgmorton</hi> coming into Scotland, found the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates in more insolent terms then had been reported; being divided in opinion, what to do with the Queen, some would have her banished perpetually, into England or France; some would have her questioned before the Judges, committed to perpetuall custody, and her son pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed King: others, more inhumane, would have her at once depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of Princely Authority, of life and all; and this, <hi>Knox</hi> and some other Ministers thundred out of the Pulpits. <hi>Throgmorton</hi> on the other side, alleaged many passages out of the holy Scriptures, touching Obedience to the higher Powers; maintaining, That the Queen was subject to no Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunall, but that in Heaven; That no Judge upon Earth might call her in question; That there was no Office nor Jurisdiction in Scotland, which was not derived from her Authority, and revokeable at her pleasure. They again opposed the peculiar Right of the Kingdom of Scotland; and that in extraordinary cases, they were to proceed besides order, taking up <hi>Buchanans</hi> Arguments; who in those dayes, by instigation of <hi>Murray,</hi> wrote that damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Dialogue, <hi>De Iure Regni apud Scotos</hi>; wherein, against the verity of the Scottish History, he indeavours to prove, That the People have power, both to create, and to depose their King. After all their debating, all that <hi>Throg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morton</hi> could get of them, was a Writing without any Subscription, wherein they protested, They had shut up the Queen for no other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, but to keep her apart from <hi>Bothwell,</hi> whom she loved so desperately, that to injoy him, she regarded not all their ruines; willing him to rest satisfied with this Answer, till such time as the rest of the Peers met together. And notwithstanding all he could say, they shut up the Queen daily, in more straight custody, though with tears she besought them to deal more mildly with her, and to let her but once have a sight of her son, which would not be granted her. At last when fair perswasions would not serve to make her freely give over the Kingdom, they threatned to question her o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly for incontinent living, for the Kings murder, and for Tyranny, so as through feare of death, they compelled Her, unheard, to set her

hand to three Instruments; In the first whereof, she gave over the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to her young son, at that time scarce thirteen Months old: In the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, she constituted <hi>Murray</hi> Vice-Roy during the minority of her son: In the third, in case he refused the charge, these Governours were nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; <hi>Iames</hi> Duke of Chasteau, Herald, <hi>Giles Spike</hi> Earl of Argile, <hi>Matthew</hi> Earl of Lenox, <hi>Iohn</hi> Earl of Atholl, <hi>Iames</hi> Earl of Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And presently she signified to Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> by <hi>Throgmorton,</hi> that she had made these grants by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion through the counsell of <hi>Throgmorton,</hi> telling her that a grant extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from one in prison (which is a just fear) is actually void and of no effect.</p>
            <p>Five dayes after the Queen had made this Resignation, <hi>Iames</hi> the sixth, the Queens Son, was Anointed and Crown'd King, <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> preaching at the same time; but a Protestation was then put in by the <hi>Hamiltons,</hi> that all this ought to be no prejudice to the Duke of Chasteau Herald in his Right of succession against the Family of <hi>Lenox</hi>; but Queen <hi>Elisabeth</hi> had forbidden <hi>Throgmorton</hi> to be at the Action, that she might not seem by the presence of her Embassador, to approve their proceeding in displacing of the Queen.</p>

to the Emperor, with the Order of the Garter: But in the Treaty of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, there fell out so many difficulties, about Religion, maintenance of the Duke, about the Royall Title, and concerning succession, that after it had been treated of seven whole yeers together, it came at last to nothing, and the Duke not long after marryed <hi>Mary</hi> daughter to <hi>Albert</hi> the fifth Duke of Bavaria; yet both he and the Emperour continued ever after a good corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence with the Queen.</p>
            <p>About this time, there came from <hi>Iohn Basil</hi> Emperour of Russia and Muscovia, <hi>Stephen Twerdic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Merchants by vertue of a Grant from Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> had combined themselves into a Society, which they called the Muscovie Company; and having large Priviledges granted them from the Emperour, went thither with a Navie yeerly, making a very gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Voyage; but then it proved most gainfull, when for the Queens sake they obtained at the Emperours hands, in the yeer 1569. That none but the English of that Company, should Traffique in the North-parts of Russia. With these Russian Embassadours there returned into England, <hi>Anthony Ienkinson,</hi> who in his Travels had made curious Observation of Russia, set forth a Geographicall Description of it, and was the first of the English that sailed through the Caspian Sea. And this yeer, the 8. of June, Sir <hi>Thomas Sackvile</hi> was created Baron of Buckhurst, at Whitehall.</p>
            <p>We have seen before, the first Act of the Queen of Scots Tragedy: Now comes in the second, having been 11 Moneths kept a prisoner; at last, by the help of <hi>George Dowglas,</hi> to whose Brother she was committed, she made escape from Loch-levyn, to Hamiltons castle; where upon the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of <hi>Robert Melvyn,</hi> and others, in a meeting of a great part of the Nobility, there was drawn a sentence declaratory, That the Grant extorted from the Queen in prison, (which is <hi>Iustus metus</hi>) was actually void from the beginning. Upon which Declaration, great multitudes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In this case, the Queen sought to save her self by flight, journeying in one day threescore miles, and coming at night to the house of <hi>Maxwell</hi> Lord <hi>Heris,</hi> from thence she sent <hi>Iohn Beton</hi> to Queen <hi>Elisabeth</hi> with a Diamond Ring, which she had fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Queen <hi>Elisabeth</hi> returned answer, that she should expect from her, in abundant manner, all loving and friendly offices. But before the Messenger was returned, she, contrary to the advice of her friends, entred into a small Bark, &amp; with the Lords, <hi>Heris,</hi> and <hi>Flemming,</hi> and a few others, landed at Wickinton in Cumberland, neer the mouth of the River of Decwent, the seventeenth day of May; and the same day wrote Letters to the Queen in French with her own hand, the effect whereof was, That having made an escape from the the hands of her insolent and rebellious Subjects, she was now come into England, upon certain hope of her approved clemencie; and therefore humbly desiring, she might forthwith be conducted to her presence. Queen <hi>Elisabeth</hi> sending Letters by Sir <hi>Francis Knolles,</hi> comforted her, and promised her aid and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, according to the equity of her cause; but denyed her accesse, for that she was held guilty of many crimes, giving command to have her brought to Carlile, as a place of better safety. The Queen of Scots receiving this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, and finding accesse to the Queen denyed her, maketh request again by Letter, that she might have leave, both to unfold the injuries she had received, and to answer the crimes objected, in her own presence;

            <p>About this time the <hi>Guises</hi> in France, and the Duke <hi>D'Alva</hi> in the Low-countries, began to endeavour the utter extirpation of the Protestant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.

               </gap>hem in pieces, and although that tumult was soon quieted, yet the King of Spain taking advantage at the rashnesse of a few, to charge the whole Nation with Rebellion: sent amongst them <hi>Ferdinando Alvarez,</hi> Duke <hi>D' Alva,</hi> a bloody and fierce man, (who contrary to the Ordinances and customes of the Country) took away all authority from the ordinary Courts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice; Erected new consistories; condemned and put to death the Peers, without tryall by their lawfull Judges; Placed Garrisons of Spaniards throughout all their Cities and Villages, and by force exacted the twenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth part of the fruits of the Earth, and the tenth of moveables upon every Alienation. At that time, a mighty masse of money borrowed from the <hi>Genowayes,</hi> and other Italian Merchants was sent out of Spain into the Low-countries, there to be imployed to interest, which being brought by ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, was pursued by the French; and forced to fly for succour into the Havens of England, whom the Queen commanded to be succour'd; as conceiving the money to be the King of Spains as it was given out: But at the same time, Cardinall <hi>Odette</hi> coming out of France into England, and giving notice to the Queen that the money was not the King of Spains, but belonged to certain merchants of Geneva; from whence the Duke <hi>D' Alva</hi> had taken it against their will, with a purpose to imploy it to the ruine of the Protestants; and information also being given her by one that had a property in the money that it was so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> she determined to put in security, and to borrow the money of the merchants her self, which is an usuall thing with Princes when goods are taken in their Ports; and the King of Spain himself had lately done the like.

            <p>Upon occasion of this Money detained, certain Peers of England, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst whom, were the Duke of Norfolk, the Marquesse of Winchester, the Earls of Arundell, Northumberland, Pembroke, Leicester, and others, Accused Sir <hi>William Cecill,</hi> for sending away money into France, making this their colour, but done indeed out of envying his great favour with the Queen, and suspecting him to incline to the house of Suffolk in the matter of succession.

            <p>The Earl <hi>Murray</hi> being returned into Scotland, makes the Lords believe that he desires a meeting at <hi>Edinbourgh,</hi> to consult about restoring the Queen to her Liberty; but as <hi>Hamilton</hi> Duke of Chasteau Herald (appointed Vicegerent of the Kingdome by the Queen) and the Lord <hi>Heris</hi> were coming thither, he circumvented them, and before any of the rest came cast them into prison; and forthwith in an open War, oppresseth all her Favourers. It may be thought, the Earl <hi>Murray</hi> could have been content, the Queen should have been set at liberty; but that he knew,

            <p>And now the Destiny of the Duke of Norfolk began to work: It was in every ones mouth, that the Duke should marry the Queen of Scots; and it is true, there had been motions made; but the matter not so forward, as the Voice of the People, which commonly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sageth what will follow. It had been motioned to the Duke at York, by the Bishop of Ros<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e; and afterward (in pretence at least.) by <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray</hi> himself at Hampton-Court; but the Duke, before he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve in the matter, deliberated with the Earls of Aru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dell, Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland, Westmerland, Sussex, Pembroke, Southampton, and Leicester himself, who all judged it fit, he should acquaint the Queen with it first, and then leave the matter to her liking. Within a few dayes, Sir <hi>Nicholas Throgmorton</hi> meeting the Duke in the Pallace at Westminster, advised him, to move the Earl of Leicester himself to embrace the match, seeing he had formerly sued for it; but if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused it, then at least to take him along with him, for that himself a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone would hereby be able to procure the Queens consent. A day or two after, the Earl of Leicester propounded the matter to the Duke, and then communicateth it to the Earls of Arundell and Pembroke; who thereupon, together with <hi>Throgmorton,</hi> wrote Letters to the Queen of Scots, commending the Duke of Norfolk to her for a Husband; the Duke himself likewise writeth to her, tendering his singular Love and respect unto her. Upon this, Articles are drawn, written with Leicesters own hand, and sent to the Queen of Scots; to which if she consented, they then promised to procure, that Queen <hi>Elisabeth</hi> should give her assent, and that forthwith she should be reinvested in her Kingdom, and the Succession of England should be confirmed upon her. Wee may easily believe, the Queen of Scots was not hardly drawn to give consent to her own desire; but in the mean time, the Duke had imparted to the Lord <hi>Lumley</hi> the whole proceeding, and had much ado to get the Earl of Leicesters consent, that he might advise of it with some other of his Friends; yet a little after, he opened the matter to <hi>Cecill</hi> also. The rumour of this Marriage was soon come to the Queens ears; which the Duke understanding, hee dealt earnestly with the Earl of Leicester, to have the matter propounded to the Queen out of hand. Leicester makes delayes, and pretends causes to put it off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> which <hi>Cecill</hi> seeing, he adviseth the Duke, to go and acquaint the Queen with it himself. This councell Leicester opposed, promising to open it to the Queen as she went in Progresse. At length, at Farn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, the Duke standing by as the Queen sate at Table, she gave him a tart Admonition, That he were best take heed, upon what pillow he rested his head. After this, at Tichfield, Leicester fell sick, or at least counterfeited; to whom the Queen coming, and bidding him be of good cheer; hee with sighs and tears craved pardon for his fault, and unfolded to her the whole story from the very beginning. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, the Queen called the Duke into the Gallery, reproving him sharply, for going about the Marriage, without acquainting her; and commanding him, upon his Allegiance, to desist. The Duke made
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52616:246"/>
her a free and hearty promise of obedience, and spared not to say (as if he lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle regarded the Qu. of Scots) that his Revenues in England were not much lesse then hers in Scotland; and that when he was at his house in Norwich, he thought himself in a sort not inferior to some kings: but notwithstanding, finding the Queens anger by her countenance, and perceiving Leicester to be in a manner quite alienated, &amp; most of the Nobility also, as scarcely saluting him when they met him, he grew extremely dejected, and prepared presently to leave the Court, meaning to stay at Norfolk, till by his friends intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and his own submissive Letters, the Queens heart might be mollified to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him: Mean while, the Court was suspitously fearfull, lest he should raise Rebellion, and (they say) it was concluded, that if he did so, the Qu. of Scots should presently be made away. And now the Duke, who held secret commerce by Letters with the Bishop of Ross, <hi>Throgmorton</hi> and <hi>Leicester</hi> (for they were sent to and fro in bottles) being examined touching the marriage of the Qu. of Scots, and certain secret conferences with the Bishop of Rosse, confessed most of the Objections, and was thereupon committed to the Tower, under the custody of Sir <hi>Henry Nevill</hi>; within two dayes after the Bishop of Rosse likewise is examined, and together with the Florentine <hi>Robert Ridolph,</hi> is delivered to the custody of Sir <hi>Francis Walsingham,</hi> the Earl of Pembroke is confined to his house, and examined privately; but his confession was not committed to writing; It being his request because he could not write himself. At this time, the rumor of Insurrection in the North, begun in Autumne before, grew very strong, by reason of some frequent meetings of the Earls of Northumberland, Westmerland, and others, who thereupon being upon their Allegiance sent for to repaire pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently to the Queen, they make delayes (for they stayed waiting for supplies, both from the Scots, and from the Duke <hi>D'Alva</hi>) when the Earl of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland, doubtfull what to do, was frighted of purpose by his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, telling him, that men in Arms were neer at hand to apprehend him; Who thereupon in a tempestuous night, riseth out of his bed, and in great fear gets into his Park at Topcliffe, and the night following to Branspith to the Earl of Westmerlands house, where a great many were met that were acquainted with the Enterprise: Here they brake forth into an open Rebellion, being pressed forward, by one <hi>Nicholas Morton</hi> a Romish Priest, sent by the Pope to pronounce Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> an Heretick; and therefore to have utterly lost all Right of Soveraignty: By and by they send forth a writting, wherein they declare that they had taken Arms for no other end, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

where the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> hid himself at <hi>Harclow</hi>; in a poor Cottage, amongst the <hi>Grayhams</hi> (famous Robbers) who afterwards betrayed him to the Earl <hi>Murray: Westmerland</hi> made a shift to get into the <hi>Low-Countryes,</hi> where he had a slender Pension from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and there lived even to old age. Of the rest, for terrour and examples sake, there were hanged at <hi>Durham,</hi> threescore and six of the chief; amongst whom, <hi>Plomtree,</hi> a noted Priest. At <hi>York</hi> were executed, <hi>Simon Digby, Iohn Fulthrop, Thomas Bishop, Robert Penyman</hi>; and at <hi>London</hi> a few months after, <hi>Christopher</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi>; and some other in other places. After this, the heads of the Rebels being convict of High Treason, were proscribed; namely, <hi>Charles,</hi> Earl of <hi>Westmerland; Thomas,</hi> Earl of <hi>Northumberland; Anne,</hi> Countesse of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland; Edward Dacres</hi> of <hi>Morton; Iohn Nevill</hi> of <hi>Leversege; Iohn Swinborn, Thomas Markenfield, Egremond Ratcliffe,</hi> brother to the Earl of <hi>Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sex; Christopher Nevill, Richard Norton, Christopher Marmaduke, Robert</hi> and <hi>Michael Tempest, George Stafford,</hi> and forty others of good account. Out of the ashes of this Rebellion, a new fire was kindled at <hi>Naworth</hi> in <hi>Cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> by <hi>Leonard Dacres,</hi> second son to the Lord <hi>Dacres</hi> of <hi>Gyllisland</hi>; He was a Party with the Earls in their Rebellion; but they breaking forth sooner then he expected, and he at that time being at the Court, and there admitted to kisse the Queens hand, tendered his service to go against them; and to that purpose, was sent home: but in his Journey (branding himself with a double disloyalty) he consulted with the Rebels, and encouraged them to go on; and by vertue of Letters of Credence from the Queen, he surprised the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle of <hi>Greystock,</hi> and other houses of the <hi>Dacres,</hi> and gathered together an Army of three thousand men: But being encountred by the Baron of <hi>Huns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> after a great fight, wherein, though he were crook-backt, he behaved himself valiantly, he was put to flight, and fled into <hi>Scotland,</hi> from whence soon after, he passed over into the <hi>Low-Countryes,</hi> and in great misery and poverty died at <hi>Louvayn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But though the Queen were thus entangled with Rebellions at home, yet she was not carelesse of the afflicted Protestants in <hi>France</hi>; for she stirred up the Protestant Princes to defend the common Cause; supplyed them with money, taking in pawn the Queen of <hi>Navar's</hi> Jewells; and gave leave to <hi>Henry Champernoon</hi> to lead into <hi>France</hi> a Troop of a hundred Horse, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men all, and Voluntaries; amongst whom were <hi>Philip Butshed, Francis Bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> and <hi>Walter Raleigh,</hi> a very young man, who now began to look into the world. But as the Queen of <hi>England</hi> assisted the French, so in revenge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the King of <hi>France</hi> meant to assist the Scots, but that he was taken away by death; being slain by a shot, at the Siege of S. <hi>Iohn D'Angelo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was at this time a Rebellion in <hi>Ireland</hi> also, raised by <hi>Edmund</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> brothers to <hi>Boteler</hi> Earl of <hi>Ormond</hi>; but after many out-rages by them committed: the Earl of <hi>Ormond</hi> first by perswasions, obtained of them to submit themselves; and when notwithstanding they were committed to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, he then obtained of the Queen they should not be called to the Barre, being exceedingly grieved that any of his Blood should be attaynted of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion. The rest of the Rebells were pursued by Sir <hi>Humphrey Gilbert,</hi> and soon dispersed.</p>
            <p>And now the Earl of <hi>Murray,</hi> Regent of <hi>Scotland,</hi> when he had wrought all things to his hearts desire, and thought himself secure, at <hi>Lithquo,</hi> riding along the streets, was shot into the belly with a Bullet, beneath the Navill, and there fell down dead.

This writing the Queen could not reade without indignation; but to the Delegates she gave this Answer; She saw no just cause yet, why they should handle the Queen in such manner; and therefore willed them to think upon some course out of hand, how to allay the dissentions in <hi>Scotland.</hi> Hereupon in Sir <hi>Nich.

how against all law he had been kept a long time in prison: and now, to his great disgrace, was not Summoned to the Parliament: he exhibited to him a Catalogue of such of the Nobilitie, who had vowed to Assist him: he shewed how the Pope, (so the Catholick Religion might be promoted) would himself undergo all the charge of the Warre, and had already layd down an hundred thousand Crownes; whereof himself had distributed twelve thousand amongst the English that were fled: he promised, that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> would send four thousand horse, and six thousand foot to his Assistance; to these reasons the Bishop of <hi>Rosse</hi> added, That it was an easie matter for him to surprize the Queen; whom, when he had in his hands, he might then set the Queen of Scots at liberty, and might easily obtain of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> a toleration of Religion.

            <p>In <hi>France</hi> a little before this, was the mariage solemnized between <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth King of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of <hi>Austria</hi> daughter to the Emperor <hi>Maximilian</hi>; in gratulation whereof, Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> sent into <hi>France, Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Buckhurst,</hi> who with great magnificence was received, and perhaps the more, in regard of a motion now intended to be made: for the Lord <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurst,</hi> having in his retinue, one <hi>Guydo Cavalcantius</hi> a noble man of <hi>Florence,</hi> the Queen Mother of <hi>France,</hi> as being a <hi>Florentine</hi> her self, had often conference with him, when she would many times say, what a happines it would be to both the Kingdoms, if a Match were made between the Queen of <hi>England</hi> and her sonne <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Angiou</hi>; and at last desired him to commend the motion to the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> both from her, and from her son the King of <hi>France,</hi> as a thing they both exceedingly desired. The Lord <hi>Buckhurst</hi> returned, having for a present from the King of <hi>France</hi> a chayn weighing a thousand <hi>French</hi> crowns; and <hi>Cavalcantius</hi> at his return made the motion to the Queen, who seemed not unwilling to hearken to it; for by this Match, there should be added to the Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> the wealthy Dukedoms of <hi>Angiou, Bourbon, Auverne,</hi> and in possibility, the Kingdome of <hi>France</hi> it self. Hereupon a Treaty was held, in which the <hi>French</hi> propounded three Articles, one concerning the Coronation of the Duke; another, concerning the Joynt Administration of the Kingdom; a third, concerning a Toleration of his Religion: to which it was answered, that the two first Articles might in some sort be composed; but the third, scarce possibly: for though a contrary Religion might be tolerated, between Subjects of the same King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; yet between a wife and her husband, it seemed very Incongruous and inconvenient; yet the matter at last came to this conclusion, That if the Duke would afford his presence with the Queen at divine Service, and not refuse to hear and learn the doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi>; he should not be compelled to use the English Rites, but at his pleasure use the Romane; not being expresly against the word of God.

breast, answered guilty, in like manner they answered all. After this, the Lord <hi>Steward</hi> with teares in his eyes, pronounced sentence in forme as is used. A few dayes after were <hi>Barnes</hi> and <hi>Mather</hi> executed, who conspired with one <hi>Herle,</hi> to make away certaine of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors, and to free the Duke; but <hi>Herle</hi> revealed the businesse pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently, to whom <hi>Barnes</hi> (when hee saw his Accuser brought forth) smilingly said, <hi>Herle</hi> thou wert but one houre before mee; else I had beene in thy place for the accuser, and thou in my roome to be han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: at the same time with them was hanged also <hi>Henry Rolfe,</hi> for counterfeiting the Queens hand.

            <p>At this time and upon this occasion, a Parliament was Assembled, wherein amongst other Lawes, it were Enacted, that if any man shall go about to free any person imprisoned by the Queens expresse Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Within ten dayes after the Dukes death, <hi>William</hi> Lord <hi>De-la-ware,</hi> Sir <hi>Ralph Sadler, Thomas Wilson</hi> Doctor of the Laws, and <hi>Thomas Brumley</hi> the Queens Solicitour, were sent to the Queen of Scots, to expostulate with her; That shee had usurped the Title and Arms of the Kingdom of England, and had not renounced the same, according to the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Treaty at Edinburgh, That shee had endeavoured the marriage of the Duke of Norfolke, without acquainting the Queene, and had used all forcible meanes to free him out of prison; had raised the Rebellion in the North, had relieved the Rebels both in Scotland and in the Low-Countries; had implored Aids from the Pope, the King of Spaine and others; had conspired with certaine of the English, to free her out of Prison, and Declare her Queen of England; Lastly, that she had procured the Popes Bull against the Queen, and suffered herself to be publikely named the Queen of England in Forreigne Countries: All which accusations she either absolutely denyed, or else fairly extenuated, and though (as she said) she were a free Queen, and not subject to any creature; yet she was content, and requested, that she might make her personall answer at the next Parliament.</p>
            <p>About this time, the King of Spain by his Embassadour here, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to the Queen, that the Rebels of the Netherlands were har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured and entertained in England, contrary to the Articles of the League; whereupon the Queen set forth a severe Proclamation, That all the Dutch, who could any wayes be suspected of Rebellion, should presently depart the Realm; which yet turned little to <hi>D'Alva's,</hi> or the King of Spains benefit: For hereupon, <hi>Count Vander-Mark,</hi> and other Dutch going out of England surprized the Brill first, then Flushing, and afterwards drew other Towns to Revolt, and in a short time excluded
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52616:251"/>
the Duke <hi>D'Alva</hi> in a manner from the Sea. And this errour, to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Protestant party to get possession of the Sea-towns, hath been the cause they have been able to hold out, even all this long time, against the King of Spain. And now many military men having little to do at home, got them into the Netherlands, some to Duke <hi>D'Alva</hi>; but the far greater number to the Prince of Orenge: The first of whom, was <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Morgan,</hi> who carryed three hundred English to Flushing; then follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his procurement nine Companies more under the conduct of <hi>Humphry Gilbert</hi>; and afterward it became the Nursery of all our English Souldiers.</p>
            <p>At this time, <hi>Charls</hi> the French King setting his mind wholly (at least see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming so) upon the Low-Country War, concluded a peace and entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a league with Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>; which was to remain firm, not only du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their two lives, but between their successors also, if the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It was likewise agreed, what aid by Sea or Land, they should each of them afford to other upon occasion; and for ratification of this League, <hi>Edward Clinton</hi> Earl of Lincoln and Admirall of England was sent into France, with whom went the Lord <hi>Dacres, Rich, Talbot, Sands,</hi> and others. The French King likewise sent the Duke of Memorancy, and <hi>Paul Foix</hi> i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to England with a great train; that the Queen in the presence of them, and the Embassador in Ordinary might sweare to the league, which she did at Westminster, the seaventeenth of May, in the yeer 1572.

            <p>
               <hi>Memorancye</hi> whilst he tarryed in England, made intercession in his Kings name, that what favour could be without danger, might be shewed to the Queen of Scots; and then made much a do again about the marriage with the Duke of Angiou; but being hopelesse to make conclusion thereof, by reason of the diversity of Religion he returned into France; for now was great provision making ready for the mariage, between <hi>Henry</hi> King of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre; and the Lady <hi>Margeret</hi> the French Kings Sister; to which solemnity with notable dissimulation, the Queen of Navarre and the chief of all the Protestants were allured, being born in hand that there should be a renova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of love, and a perpetuall peace established: The Earl of Leicester likewise and the Lord <hi>Burleigh</hi> were invited out of England, and out of Germany, the sons of the Prince Elector Palatine under colour of honour: but indeed, that they might be intrapped, and they, and together with them the Protestant Religion at one blow, if not clean cutt off, yet receive<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>A little before this, <hi>Mota Fenell</hi> Embassador to the King of France, being in England, by vertue of an order from the Queen Mother of France, propoundeth to Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> at Kenelworth (two dayes before the Massacre in that Kingdome) the marriage of her youngest sonne <hi>Francis</hi> Duke of Alenson (for the Queen Mother had been told by some cunning men, that all her sons should be Kings, and she knew

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52616:252" rendition="simple:additions"/>
It is true, the Queen conceived divers reasons, why it was fit for her to marry; but the Courtiers for their own ends disswaded her as much from it: at last the Queen Mother of France was wonderfull importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, that her sonne <hi>Alenson</hi> might have leave to come and see her<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hereupon a peace was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in France, and in certain places the Protestants were allowed to exercise their Religion: and then again the French King and the Queen Mother, used all their endeavour to have the marriage go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward (for they were very desirous th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To this last re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, she not only consented with all alacrity, but also made offer of a Fleet to conduct him thither. In the mean while, <hi>Alenson</hi> fell sick of the Meazles, which his mother signified to Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> by Count <hi>Rhets,</hi> excusing him thereupon for not coming into England as he had determined: The <hi>Count</hi> found the Queen at Canterbury, where she gave him Royall inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment: and <hi>Matthew Parker</hi> Archbishop of Canterbury, Royall intertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to them both.</p>

For which, the subtle Queen-Mother so complained of him to Queen <hi>Elisabeth,</hi> that hee was fain to go into France, and there to crave pardon for his fault. But <hi>Navarre,</hi> not unmindfull of this kindnesse in <hi>Wilks,</hi> when about five and twenty yeers after, being King of France, hee saw him in Normandy, hee Knighted him. Hereupon the Queen sent <hi>Thomas Randoll</hi> into France, to the Queen-Mother, that if it were possible, hee might gain Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation for <hi>Alenson</hi> her sonne, and for the King of Navarre. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee was landed in France, <hi>Charles</hi> the then French King dyed, whose Funerall Rites were solemnly performed in Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Church in London.</p>
            <p>Assoon as <hi>Henry</hi> the third, King of France, was come from Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>Roger</hi> Lord <hi>North</hi> was sent into France, to congratulate his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, and his happy Inauguration into the Kingdom; who thereupon, together with the Queen-Mother, did forthwith send their joynt Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into England, strongly soliciting the businesse of marriage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Alenson</hi> and the Queen. In the mean time notwithstanding, they used all possible devices, (and left no means unsought) to get the yong King of Scotland to bee sent into France, and to deprive <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> who was the Regent, of his Authority, whereof the Queen of Scots also was very desirous; shee being perswaded, that if her sonne were once gotten safely into France, shee and the Catholicks in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land should bee more mildly used. At which time, an aspersion was cast upon the Queen of Scots, as if she had made the match between <hi>Charles</hi> Unckle to the Queen of Scots (who had lately the Earldom of Lenox confirmed to him by Parliament) and <hi>Elizabeth Cavendish</hi> the Countesse of Shrewsburie's daughter by a former husband; upon which ground, both their mothers and some others also were kept in Prison for a time; and being doubted whereunto this marriage should tend: <hi>Henry</hi> Earle of Huntington, President of the Councell in the North, is authorized with secret Instructions to examine it. It will be fit here to say something of this place of Government in the North; which from small beginnings, is now become so eminent as it is at this day, whereof this was the Originall. When as in the Raigne of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight, after that the Rebellion in the Northerne parts, about the subversion of Abbyes was quieted, the Duke of Norfolke tarryed in those quarters, and many complaints of injuries done were tendered unto him, whereof some he composed himself, and others hee commended under his Seale to men of wisdome to determine: Hereof when King <hi>Henry</hi> heard, he sent down a peculiar Seal to be used in these cases, and calling home the Duke, committed the same to <hi>Tunstall</hi> Bishop of Durham, and Constituted Assistants with Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to heare and determine the complaints of the poor, and he was the first that was called President; and from that time, the authority of his successours grew in credit.</p>
            <p>It was now the yeer One thousand five hundred seventy five, and the Eighteenth yeer of Queen <hi>Elisabeths</hi> Raign, vvhen <hi>Henry</hi> the third
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52616:254"/>
King of France being returned from Poland, and Crowned at Rheims, was carefull to have the League of Blois confirmed; which, in the Yeer 1572. had been concluded betweene his Brother <hi>Charles</hi> and that most Illustrious Queen ELIZABETH; Now therefore hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed it with His owne Subscription, and delivered it to <hi>Dale</hi> the Queen's Legier, as the Queen like wise ratified it at Saint-James neere Westminster: But a little after he demanded by Letters, whether the mutuall defence against all persons mentioned in the League, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to comprehend the case of Religion also? Whereunto she an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering, that it did comprehend it; hee thereupon hearing this from the Queen, began presently to prepare Warre against the Protestants, and <hi>Alenson</hi> being drawne to the Adverse party, there was no speech of the marriage for a long time.</p>
            <p>In the Netherlands at this time, <hi>Lodovicke Zuinga</hi> who was suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor unto Duke <hi>D'Alva,</hi> was wholly bent to recover the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Seas, which <hi>D'Alva</hi> had neglected; but not being suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently provided of a Navy, he sent <hi>Boischott</hi> into England, that with the Queens leave, he might take up Ships and Marriners to goe against the Hollanders and Zelanders, but this she would not grant: Then hee made suite, that the Queen would please not to take it in evill part, if the banished persons of the English in the Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries served the King of Spaine in a Sea-Fight against the Hollanders; and that they might have free accesse to the Ports of England, to buy provision for ready money; But this shee would not grant neither: Then he made request, that the Dutch, who were Rebels against the King of Spaine, might be put out of England; but neither would shee grant this, as being an Action voide of Humanity; and against the Lawes of Hospitality; yet because shee would not be thought to violate the old <hi>Burgundian</hi> Law, shee Commanded by Proclamation, that the Shipps of the Dutch which were made ready, should not go forth of the Haven; nor yet the Dutch, who had taken up Armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the King of Spaine, enter into the Ports of England, and by name, the Prince of Orenge, and Fifty other the prime of that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and this shee did the more willingly, because <hi>Zuinga</hi> at the intercession of <hi>Wilson</hi> the English Embassador, had removed the Earle of Westmerland, and other English Fugitives out of the Dominions of the King of Spaine, and had also dissolved the English Seminary at Doway; though in stead thereof, the <hi>Guises</hi> through the procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the thirteenth, set up another Seminary at Rhemes.</p>
            <p>And at this time the Prince of Orenge, perceiving his Forces but small, and thinking himself too weake for the King of SPAINE, and little hope of ayde from England, he entered into Consultation with the Confederate States, to whose protection, they were best and in the most security to betake themselves: The Princes of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many they knew were not all of one minde, parted from money ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hardly, and did not every way, nor would not by no meanes pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible accord and concurre with them in their Religion; and therefore they were not so fit. Then, the French they saw, were intangled in a Civill War, and so had enough of their owne to do; besides the old grudges and heart-burnings that vvere between the French and Dutch; and therefore neither were they so fit. There remained then the English, as the fittest of any (if it might be obtained) seeing they were Neighbouss, of the same Religion, and of a Language not much different, strong in shipping, and rich in Merchandize. Hereupon (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the commodiousnesse of the English Nation) they send into

            <p>At this time a Voyage was undertaken, to trie if there could be found any sea upon the North part of <hi>America,</hi> leading to the wealthy coast of <hi>Cathaia,</hi> whereby in one Comerce, might be joyned the riches of both the East and West parts of the worlde, in which voyage was imployed <hi>Martyn Frobysher,</hi> who set saile from <hi>Harwich</hi> the eighteenth of <hi>Iune,</hi> and the ninth of <hi>August,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into that Bay, or sea, but could passe no further for Snow and Ice.

            <p>About this time died the Emperour <hi>Maximilian,</hi> a Prince that Deserved well of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and the English, who thereupon sent Sir <hi>Philip Sidney</hi> to his sonne <hi>Ridolphus</hi> King of the Romanes, to condole his Fathers death, and congratulate his succession: as likewise to doe the like, for the decease of the Count Electour Palatine, named <hi>Frederick</hi> the third, with her surviving sonne.</p>
            <p>And now <hi>Walter Deveruex</hi> Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> who out of <hi>Leicesters</hi> envie, had bin recalled out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> was out of <hi>Leicesters</hi> feare, (as being threatned by him) sent back again into <hi>Ireland,</hi> but with the empty title of Earl <hi>Marshall</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi>; with the grief whereof, he fell into a bloody Flux, and in most grievous torments ended his life. When he had first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired the standers by to admonish his sonne (scarce tenne yeers old at that time) to have alwayes before his eyes, the six and thirtieth yeer of his age, as the utmost terme of his life, which neither himself, nor his father before him could out-go, and the sonne indeed attained not to it, as shall hereafter he declared. He was suspected to be poisoned, but Sir <hi>Henry Sidney,</hi> Deputie of <hi>Ireland,</hi> after di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent search made, wrote to the Lords of the Counsell, That the Earl often said, It was familiar to him upon any great discontentment to fall into a Flux, and for his part, he had no suspition of his being poisoned, yet was this suspition encreased; for that presently after his death, the Earl of <hi>Leicester,</hi> with a great sum of money and large promises, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting away <hi>Dowglasse Sheffield,</hi> by whom he had a son openly marryed <hi>Essex</hi> his widdow.

At which time it fell out that as the Queen, together with <hi>Simier,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> and <hi>Hatton</hi> Vice-Chamberlaine were rowed in a barge to <hi>Greenwich,</hi> a young man shooting off a Harquebus out of a boate, shot one of the rowers in the Queenes Barge thorough the arme with a bullet, who was presently taken and ledde to the Gallowes, but upon solemne Protestation, that he did it unwillingly, and out of no malicious Intent, he was let go and Pardoned. Some would have perswaded the Queen that was purposely suborned to shoote either her or the <hi>French</hi> Embassadour: but she was so far from suspecting her Subjects; that she would often say, She would not believe any thing against them which a mother would not believe against her children.</p>
            <p>After a few dayes <hi>Alanson</hi> himself came privately into <hi>England</hi> with only on or two attendants, and came to the Queen at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> at a time when she thought not of it; they had secret conference together, all parties being sent away, after which, being seen of very few, he returned home; but within a moneth or two after the Queen enjoyned the Lord <hi>Burleigh</hi> treasurer, the Earle of <hi>Sussex, Leicester, Hatton</hi> and <hi>Walsingham,</hi> seriously to weigh both the dangers, and the Commodities likely to arise from the marriage with him, and to consult with <hi>Simier</hi> concerning the marriage Covenants.</p>
            <p>As in <hi>England</hi> there was some feare of this Frenchman: So in <hi>Scotland</hi> at this time of another Frenchman, called <hi>Esme Steward,</hi> Lord of <hi>Aubigny,</hi> who came now into <hi>Scotland</hi> to visit the King his cosen. He was the sonne of <hi>Iohn Steward</hi> brother to <hi>Matthew Steward</hi> Earle of <hi>Lenox</hi> the Kings grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, and had denomination from <hi>Aubigny</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> which title <hi>Charles</hi> the seaventh King of <hi>France</hi> had antiently conferred upon <hi>Iohn Steward</hi> of the Familie of <hi>Lenox,</hi> who being constable of the Scottish Army in <hi>France,</hi> vanquished the English in one battile, and was slain by them in another: and from that time the title belonged to the younger descent of that house. This <hi>Esme Steward,</hi> the King embraced with exceeding great love, made him Lord Chamberlaine of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and Captain of the Castle of <hi>Dumbriton,</hi> and created him first Earle and then Duke of <hi>Lenox.</hi> The feare from this man was; because he was deuoted to the <hi>Guises</hi> and the Popish religion, and that which encreased the feare from this man; because he applied himselfe to <hi>Mortons</hi> adversaries, and mediated to have <hi>Thomas Carre</hi> Lord of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishurst</hi> called home, who of all men was most addicted to the Queen of Scots.</p>

            <p>This yeer died Sir <hi>Nicholas Bacon,</hi> Lord Keeper of the Great Seal; but who, by vertue of an Act of Parliament, alwayes exercised the Jurisdiction of

            <p>In <hi>Ireland</hi> at this time, in the Province of <hi>Munster, Iames Fitz Morris</hi> kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a new fire of Rebellion; for after his former submission upon his knees, vowing all Obedience to the Queen, he stole away into <hi>France,</hi> and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the French King, if he would lend him assistance, to make him King of <hi>Ireland.</hi> But being by him slighted, he went into <hi>Spain,</hi> and made the like offer to the King there. The King of <hi>Spain</hi> sent him to the Pope, from whom (by means of <hi>Nicholas Sanders,</hi> an English Priest, and <hi>Alan</hi> an Irish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, both Doctors of Divinity) he obtained a little money, a Legats Authority for <hi>Sanders,</hi> a consecrated Banner, and Letters of Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Catholike King. And returning from <hi>Spain</hi> with those Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, three Ships, and a few men, he landed at <hi>Smerwick Kerry,</hi> a Demy Island in the West part of <hi>Ireland,</hi> about the first day of <hi>Iuly,</hi> where (the place being first of all consecrated by the Priests) he built a Fort, and brought the Ships close under it; but these were presently set upon and carryed away, by <hi>Thomas Courtney,</hi> and thereby the Spaniards deprived of their opportunity of coming thither by Sea. But now <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Iames,</hi> brothers to the Earl of <hi>Desmond,</hi> gathering together a small number of Irish, joyn themselves presently with their kinsman <hi>Fitz Morris.</hi> Yet the Spaniards seeing that but a very few Irish, and those unarmed, came unto them, they began to distrust the estate they were in, and to cry out, That they were undone; whom <hi>Fitz Morris</hi> heartened the best he could, telling them that Supplyes were presently to come. And going himself to get more company, he passed thorow the Land of his Cosin <hi>William a Burgh,</hi> who though he had been a Rebell before, yet was now grown loyall, so as there fell out a Skirmish between them; in which <hi>Fitz Morris</hi> being strucken thorow with a Pike, and shot into the head with a Leaden Bullet, died in the place, and most of his Company with him; but withall, two of <hi>William Burghs</hi> sons were in that Skirmish slain also; when the Queen, to comfort him for the losse of his sons, adorned him with the Dignity of Baron of <hi>Castle Conell,</hi> and rewarded him with a yeerly Pension besides: which favours so overwhelmed him with joy, that he lived but a short while after. And now Sir <hi>William Drury</hi> the Deputy growing very sick, appointed Sir <hi>Nicholas Malby</hi> then Governour of <hi>Connaght,</hi> to be President of <hi>Munster,</hi> and Generall of the Army; at which time, the Earl of <hi>Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> who had all this while made a shew of Loyalty, breaks openly ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t was his Leader.</p>
            <p>A short time after, there landed at <hi>Smerwick</hi> in <hi>Kerry,</hi> under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>San Ioseph</hi> an Italian, about seven hundred Italian souldiers, who fortifie the place, and name it <hi>Fort del Or.</hi> Whereupon the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty sent a Trumpetter to the Fort to demand who they were, what they had to do in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and who sent them; withall commanding them to depart immediately. But they replyed, That some of them were sent from his Holinesse, other from the Catholike King, upon whom the Pope had bestowed the Kingdome of <hi>Ireland,</hi> for that Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> (by reason of heresie) hath forfeited the Right unto her; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what they had gotten, they would maintain. Upon this the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty prepares for Battery, lets flie his Ordnance four dayes together; in which time the Spaniards once or twice make sallyes out, to their own losse much, but not an English-man slain, but onely <hi>Iohn Cheek,</hi> a couragious young Gentleman, son to Sir <hi>Iohn Cheek,</hi> a learned Knight. And now <hi>San Ioseph,</hi> who commanded the Fort, a white-liver'd souldier, terrified with the continuall Battery, and having no hope of relief, either from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> or <hi>Desmond</hi> (contrary to the will of all his souldiers) he set up a White Flagge, and desired Parlee, but Parlee was denyed, because he had combined with Rebells, with whom it is not lawfull to hold Parlee. Then he demanded that his Company might passe away with their Baggage, but neither would this be granted. Then he required <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat some of the chiefer sort might have leave to depart; but neither could this be obtained. At last, when they could prevail in nothing, they hanged out the white Flagge again, and submitted themselves absolutely, without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, to the Deputies mercy, who presently consulteth how to deal with them, and this was the Case; Their number was well neer as great as the English; there was present fear of danger from the Rebells; and the English were so destitute of meat and apparell, that they were ready to mutiny, unlesse they might have the spoyl granted them; and besides, there were no ships neither to send them away if they were spared: For these Reasons it was concluded (the Deputy gain-saying, and letting tears fall) That onely the Leaders should be saved, the rest all slain, and all the Irish hanged up; which was presently put in execution; to the great disli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Queen, who detested the slaughter of such as yeelded themselves, and would accept of any excuses or allegations.</p>
            <p>And yet more cruelty then this was at that time committed in the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands</hi>; for <hi>Iohn Norris,</hi> and <hi>Oliver Temple,</hi> English Commanders, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with some Companies of Dutch, setting out early one morning, took <hi>Mechlyn</hi> a wealthy Town of <hi>Brabant,</hi> at an assault with ladders, where they promiscuously murthered both Citizens and Religious Persons, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering violence even upon the dead, taking away Grave-stones, which were sent into <hi>England</hi> to be sold.</p>
            <p>About this time certain English Priests, who were fled into the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands,</hi> in the yeer 1568, by the procurement of <hi>William Allen,</hi> an <hi>Oxford</hi> Schollar, joyned themselves to study at <hi>Doway,</hi> where they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into a Collegiate Form of Government; to whom the Pope al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed a yeerly Pension. But tumults arising in the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and the English Fugitives being commanded by the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Deputy to depart from thence, other the like Colledges, for the trayning up of the English youth, were erected, one at <hi>Rheims</hi> by the <hi>Guises,</hi> and another

               </gap>upplyes of Priests for <hi>England,</hi> when the old fayled, who should spread abroad the seeds of the Romish Religion here amongst us; from whence, those Colledges had the name of Seminaries, and they called Seminary-Priests who were trayned up in them. In these Seminaries, amongst other Disputations, it was concluded, That the Pope hath such fulnesse of Power, by Divine Right, over the whole Christian world, both in Ecclesiasticall and Secular matters, that by vertue thereof, it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for him to excommunicate Kings, absolve their subjects from their Oath of Allegiance, and deprive them of their Kingdoms. From these Seminaries at this time, there came two into <hi>England, Robert Parsons,</hi> and <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund Campian,</hi> both of them English-men, and Jesuites. <hi>Parsons</hi> was born in <hi>Somerset</hi>-shire, a fierce and rough conditioned fellow; <hi>Campian</hi> was a Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doner, of a milder disposition. They had been both brought up in <hi>Oxford; Campian</hi> a Fellow of St. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Colledge, and had been Proctor in the yeer 1569; and when he was made Deacon, counterfeited himself to be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant, till such time as he slipped out of <hi>England. Parsons</hi> was of <hi>Baylioll</hi> Colledge, where he made open profession of the Protestant Religion, till for dishonest carriage, he was expelled the House, and then fled to the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Party. Both these came privily into <hi>England,</hi> in the disguise one while of Souldiers, another while of Noble-men; sometimes like English Ministers, and sometimes in the habit of Apparitors. <hi>Parsons,</hi> who was made the Superiour, brake forth into such open words amongst the Papists, about deposing the Queen, that some of themselves had a purpose to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of him to the Magistrates. <hi>Campian,</hi> though something more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, yet in a Writing provoked the English Ministers to a dispu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing Audience given him, he put the King in minde, of what the Queen out of <hi>Isocrates,</hi> in private Letters had formerly admonished him: <hi>That a Prince must be such a lover of Truth; that more credit may be given to his bare word, than to anothers oath</hi>; and in many words advised him, to beware now in his youth of evill Councellours, and alwayes to be like himselfe. The King answered, That he was an absolute Prince, and would not that others should appoint him Councellors whom he liked not; but that he had long since devoted the first-fruits of his amitie to the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> his deer Sister, and doth now willingly make profer of the same. <hi>Walsingham</hi> now dealt with him farther; not to lay to the Queens charge what broyls had lately fallen out in <hi>Scotland</hi>; sheweth, how benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall to him, and to both kingdoms Amity had been hitherto, and would be in time to come also, so it were not neglected; and that the same might the better be confirmed, if the variance between the Nobility were layd asleep, by a Law of oblivion Enacted in Parliament, The Peers which now were removed from the Court called back again, Religion looked into, and a firm League concluded between both kingdoms. The King made answer, that he gladly embraced Amity with <hi>England,</hi> and that he would constantly defend the Religion already established: Afterward he lovingly dismissed <hi>Walsingham,</hi> though he held him no good friend to him and his Mother; and carefully looking to matters, with undestanding, even above his yeers, proposed and profered reconciliation to those that had surprized him, if within a limited time they asked Pardon; which they were so far from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the entred into new consultations to surprize him again; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they are commanded within a set time to leave the kingdom, of which number, <hi>Marre, Glames, Paslet</hi> and some other, betook themselves into <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; Boyde, Zester, Weeme, Lochlevin,</hi> into the <hi>Low-Countries; Dumfermilin</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Angus</hi> is confined to his Earldome, <hi>Gowry</hi> onely to his owne ruine stayeth behinde after the limited time, hatching new devises.</p>

            <p>At this time a Parliament was assembled at <hi>Westminster,</hi> wherein <hi>William Parrie</hi> a Welsh-man, a Doctor of the Laws, when in the Lower House a Bill was read against the Jesuites, he alone stood up, and exclaimed that it was a cruell and bloody Law: and being asked his reason, he stoutly refused, unlesse he were required by the Lords of the Councell. Hereupon he was sent to the Gate-house, but upon submission, was received into the House again. Soon after, he was accused by <hi>Edward Nevill,</hi> for holding secret consultations about making the Queen away; Who thereupon apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, upon his examination, confessed in effect thus much, That out of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content he went beyond the Sea, where, by the encouragement of <hi>Campe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio</hi> the Popes Nuntio at <hi>Venice,</hi> and grant of a plenary Indulgence from the Pope, he undertook to kill the Queen; but coming into <hi>England</hi> to that intent, he altered his minde, and disclosed to the Queen the whole matter.

After this, he chanced to see a Book of Doctor <hi>Allens,</hi> written <hi>contra Iustitiam Britannicam,</hi> wherein was declared, That Princes who were for heresie excommunicate, might lawfully be deprived of their life and Kingdom. This book wonderfully confirmed him, and he read it to <hi>Nevill</hi>; who, though he took an oath of secrecy, yet now upon a hope of the Earldom of <hi>Westmerland</hi>

A few dayes after, he was called to the Bar in <hi>Westminster</hi>-Hall, where he confessed himself guilty, and thereupon was condemned.

The <hi>States</hi> returne Answer, That they are heartily sorry they should incurre her displeasure by conferring upon the Earle that absolute Authority, not having first made her acquainted, but they beseeched her to consider the necessity of it; seeing, that for avoyding of confusion, that Authority must needs be cast upon some one or other; Neither, was there any great matter in the word <hi>Absolute,</hi> seeing the Rule and Dominion resided still in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. By these Letters, and <hi>Leicesters</hi> own submissive writing, the Queen was soon satisfied; <hi>Leicester</hi> all this while receiveth Contributions and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards from all Provinces, maketh Martiall Laws, and endeavouring like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to raise new Customs upon Merchandizes, incurred great dislike a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the common people. His first service was to relieve <hi>Grave,</hi> a Town in <hi>Brabant,</hi> which the Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> by Count <hi>Mansfield</hi> had besieged: Hither he sent the Count <hi>Hohenlo</hi> a German, and <hi>Norris</hi> Generall of the English Foot; but notwithstanding all the great service they did there, the Town in the end was taken; but <hi>Hemart</hi> the Governor, for his cowardly yeelding it up, lost his head.

they entreat him to provide some present remedy.

               </hi>; thorow whose side, the <hi>Guyses</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed the reformed Religion in <hi>Scotland,</hi> but her most intentive care was how to unite <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> in a solid friendship: To which end, she sent <hi>Thomas Randoll</hi> into <hi>Scotland,</hi> who making Propositions to the King, touching a League offensive and defensive, though the King at first required some additions, and though the French Ambassador infinitely opposed it, yet at last he consented to it; and in <hi>Iuly</hi> following, there met at <hi>Barwick, Edward</hi> Earle of <hi>Rutland, William</hi> Lord <hi>Euer,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Randoll</hi> for the Queen of <hi>England; Francis</hi> Earl of <hi>Bothwell, Robert</hi> Lord <hi>Boyde,</hi> and <hi>Humes</hi> for the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> and there the League (which was called the League of strict Amity; for that the word <hi>offensive</hi> liked not the <hi>Scots</hi>) was upon certain points concluded: First, for the maintenance of the reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and then other such Articles, as commonly in Leagues are usuall.</p>

In like manner were the former letters from the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> to <hi>Babington</hi> intercepted; as also, other letters written at the same time to <hi>Mendoza</hi> the Spanish Ambassador, <hi>Charles Paget,</hi> the Lord <hi>Paget,</hi> the Archbishop of <hi>Glasco,</hi> and <hi>Francis Englefield.</hi> The Queen as soon as she understood by these letters of the storm hanging over her head, both at home and abroad, commanded <hi>Ballard</hi> to be apprehended, who on a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain is taken in <hi>Babingtons</hi> house. <hi>Babington</hi> hereupon goeth to <hi>Walsingham,</hi> with whom he had long been a suiter, for licence to go into <hi>France,</hi> promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to do great matters in discovering the practises of the Fugitives; <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singham</hi> with fair promises drives him off from day to day; and now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades him, that for a small space till he could get his license sealed, he would lodge at his house in <hi>London,</hi> where they might have secret conference with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out suspition. This Web <hi>Walsingham</hi> himselfe had spun hitherto, and no other of the Queens Councell were made acquainted; and longer yet he would have drawn the thread out, but that the Queen was unwilling; least (as she sayd) by not avoyding danger when she might, she should seem ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to tempt God, than to trust in him. Whereupon, <hi>Walsingham</hi> sent a Note to his man <hi>Scudamore</hi> from the Court, to looke carefully to <hi>Babington</hi>: This Note was delivered in such manner, that <hi>Babington</hi> sitting by at Table when <hi>Scudamore</hi> read it, overlooked him, and read it likewise; Hereupon, suspecting that all was discovered, the next night he and <hi>Scudamore,</hi> and one or two more of <hi>Walsinghams</hi> servants supping at a Tavern, and being very merry, he made an excuse that he must needs step aside, and rose up, leaving his Cloak and his sword, and so made haste through the dark to <hi>Westminster,</hi> where <hi>Gage</hi> and he changed apparel, and then together withdrew themselves

Hereupon, Sir <hi>Edward Wootton</hi> was sent out of hand into <hi>France,</hi> to make known to the King, the order of the Treason, and to shew him the copies of the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> Letters, confirmed by the testimony of sundry of the English Nobility, that the French King might see what dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous plots were by <hi>Charls Paget,</hi> and the English Fugitives contrived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Queen of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, what should be done with the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> was a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultation, wherein the Councellours were not all of one minde; some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, That it were not good to take any rigorous course against her, but only to hold her in fast custody; both for that she was not Authour of the Treason, but only conscious to it, and because she was crazie, and not likely to live long. Others, out of a care of Religion, were of opinion, To have her forthwith Arraigned and put to death according to the Law; <hi>Leicester</hi> thought it better to have her poisoned, and sent a Divine to <hi>Walsingham</hi> to prove it lawfull, but <hi>Walsingham</hi> protested against that course. A difference then arose amongst them, by what Law to proceed against her; Whether by the Law of the 25. of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third? (In which they are Pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced guilty of Treason, who plot the destruction of the King or Queen, raise War in his Dominions, or adhere to his Adversaries.) Or else by the 27. of the Queen, Enacted a year since: Their opinion at last prevailed, who thought best to proceed against her by this latter Law, as being indeed in this case provided. Whereupon, divers of the Lords of the Privie Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, and other of the Nobility, are Authorized by the Queens Letters, to enquire by vertue of that Law, and passe sentence against all such as raised Rebellion, Invaded the Kingdome, or attempted any violence against the Queen. These Commissioners therefore upon the 11. day of <hi>October,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to <hi>Fotheringay</hi> Castle in <hi>Northamptonshire,</hi> where the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> was then held prisoner; and the next day, sent unto her <hi>VValter Mildmay, Pawlet</hi> and <hi>Edward Barker,</hi> publick Notary, who delivered her the Queens Letters; which, having with a setled countenance read, She sayd, It seems to me strange<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> that the Queen should lay her Command upon me, to hold up my hand at the Bar; as though I were a Subject, seeing I am an absolute Queen, no lesse than her selfe; but howsoever, I will never do any thing prejudiciall to Princes of my degree, nor to my Son the King of <hi>Scotland.</hi> After many meetings, she standing still upon her innocency, and upon her exemption from answering, as being an absolute Prince, and specially for yeelding to be tryed by the English Laws; of which, One (she sayd) had lately been made of purpose for her destruction. It was at last told her plainly, by the Chancellour and Treasurer, That if she refused to answer to such crimes as should be objected, they would then proceed against her, though she were absent. Being brought at last, with much ado to consent, the Commissioners came together in the Presence Chamber; a Chaire of Estate was set for the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> in the upper end of the Chamber, under a Canopy; beneath over against it, was placed a Chair for the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi>; on both sides of the Cloth of Estate, stools were set, upon which on the one side sate the Lord Chancellor, the Lord Treasurer, the Earls of <hi>Oxford, Kent, Derby, Worcester, Rutland, Cumberland, Warwicke, Pembrooke, Lincolne,</hi> and Viscount <hi>Mountacute</hi>

Then <hi>Gawdie,</hi> opened every speciality of the Law lately made (against which she had taken excception) shewing, By <hi>Babingtons</hi> confession, by Letters passed between them, by the confessions of <hi>Ballard,</hi> and <hi>Savage,</hi> by the confessions of her Secretaries, <hi>Nave,</hi> and <hi>Curle,</hi> that she was privy to their Treasons, and consented to the Invasion of <hi>England,</hi> and destruction of the Queen. To which she answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, That Letters might be counterfeited, her Secretaries might be corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and rest, in hope of life, might be drawn to confesse that which was not true: In this she stood peremptorily, That she never consented to any At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt against the Queens Person; though for her own delivery, she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed she did. After many other charges by the Commissioners, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies by the Queen of Scots; At last, she requested, that she might be heard in a full Parliament, or before the Queen her selfe, and her Councell. But this request prevailed not; for on the 25. day of <hi>October</hi> following, at the Star-Chamber in <hi>Westminster,</hi> the Commissioners met again, and there pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced sentence against her; Ratifying by their Seals and subscriptions, that after the 1. day of <hi>Iune,</hi> in the seven and twentieth year of our Soveraign Lady Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> divers matters were compassed and imagined in this Kingdom, by <hi>Anthony Babington,</hi> and others, with the privity of <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of Scots, pretending Title to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> tending to the hurt, death, and destruction of the Royall Person, of our sayd Soveraigne Lady the Queen.</p>
            <p>After a few dayes, a Parliament was holden at <hi>Westminster,</hi> the which was begun by Authority from the Queen, derived to the Archbishop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> the Lord Treasurer, and the Earl of <hi>Derby</hi>; and the same, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some Presidents. At this Parliament, the Proscriptions of the Lord <hi>Paget, Charls Paget, Francis Inglefield, Francis Throgmorton, Anthony Babington, Thomas Salisbury, Edward Iones, Chyd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Also the Peers of the Kingdom, with an unanimous consent, exhibit a Petition to the Queen by the Lord Chancellor, that for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the true Religion, and safety of the Queen, of themselves, and their Posterity, the Sentence passed against <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of Scots, might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law be presently Promulged: They put the Queen in minde of the fearfull examples of Gods Judgements extant in Scripture, upon King <hi>Saul,</hi> for sparing of <hi>Agag,</hi> and upon <hi>Ahab,</hi> for not putting <hi>Benhadad</hi> to death. But the Queen answereth them to this effect: First, acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods miraculous preservation of her, and then their constant affections towards her, for whose sakes onely she desires to live: Otherwise, when she calls to minde things past, beholds the present, and expects what may happen in time to come, that she accounts them most happy, who go soonest hence. That the Law lately made, by which the Queen of Scots is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, was not made (as some maliciously have imagined) to ensnare her;
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:52616:270"/>
but cont<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ariwise, to forewarn and deterre her from attempting any thing against it, which though it had not been made, yet were there other ancient Laws enough to condemne her. Nothing could have been more grievous to me, than that a Prince, and one so neer Allied unto me, should deserve the Sentence pronounced against her; and seeing the matter is of rare example, and of a very weighty consequence, I hope you will not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that I should at this present determine any thing; Yet that there may be no danger in delay<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> I will in due time signifie my minde unto you; and in the meane time, would have you to expect from me, whatsoever good Subjects may looke for, from a Gracious Prince.</p>
            <p>Twelve dayes after, having deeply weighed the matter in her minde, she sent the Lord Chancellor to the Peers, and <hi>Puckering</hi> to the Lower House, entreating them to advise more diligently concerning so weighty a matter, and to bethinke themselves of some wholesome remedy, by which the life of the Queen of Scots might be spared, and their security also provided for. They, when they had a long time in most serious manner deliberated hereof, Return at last this Verdict; That the Queenes life could not be in safety, while the Queen of Scots lived, unlesse she either repented and acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged her crimes, or were kept in straight custody, or bound by her oath and obligations, or gave Hostages, or lastly, departed the Kingdome. And seeing none of these were likely to be remedies; It remained, that only her death would be a remedy. Repentance in her they could little hope for, who would not so much as acknowledge her self faulty: Close Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Obligations, Oath, and Hostages they accounted as nothing, which all vanished, if the Queens life were once taken away; and if she departed the Kingdom, they feared she would straightway go about to Invade it again. These things the Lord Chancellor, and <hi>Puckering</hi> the Speaker of the Lower-House, declared to the Queen at large, and urged her in their names, to have the Sentence put in execution. Hereupon, the Queen af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a short pawse, spake at last to this effect: I protest, my chief desire hath been, that for your security, and my own safety, some other way might be devised, than that which is now propounded; but seeing it is now evident and certain, that my safety without her destruction, is in a more deplorate estate, I am most grievously affected with inward sorrow; That I, who have pardoned so many Rebells, have neglected so many Treasons (either by connivance, or silence) should now at last exercise cruelty, upon a Prince so neerly Allied to me. As for your Petition, I beseech you to rest in an Answer, without an Answer: If I say I will not grant your Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, I shall happily say what I mean not; I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> I should say, I will grant it, then cast I my selfe into destruction headlong, whose safety you so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly desire, And that I know, you in your wisedoms would not I should doe.</p>
            <p>After this, the Parliament was Prorogued, and then were the Lords <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurst</hi> and <hi>Beale</hi> sent to the Queen of Scots, to let her understand that Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was pronounced against her, and confirmed by Parliament, and that the execution of it was earnestly desired, by the Nobility and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; and therefore perswaded her, that before her death, she would make acknowledgement of her offences, against God and the Queen; Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating, That if she lived, the Religion received in <hi>England,</hi> could not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist. Hereupon, she was taken with an unwonted alacrity, and seemed to triumph for joy, giving God thanks, and gratulating her own felicity, That she should be accounted an Instrument, for establishing Religion in this Island; and therewith requested, She might have some Catholike Priest to administer the Sacrament to her; but was denied, which some deemed, not inhumane onely, but tyranicall and heathenish. The Bishop and the Dean, whom for this cause they commended to her, she utterly

rejected, and jeered at the English Nation, saying; The English were ever <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> they should now thirst after her destruction. In <hi>Dcember</hi> following the Sentence against her was Proclaimed, in <hi>London</hi> first, and after, over all the Kingdom, wherein Queen Elizabeth seriously protested, that this Promulgation of the Sentence was extorted from her, to her great grief, by the importunity of the whole Body of the Kingdome. The Queen of Scots being told hereof, seemed not a whit dejected with it; but writing to the Queen, never maketh intercession for her self, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postulateth her death, but onely makes three small requests, one, That she might be buried in <hi>France,</hi> by her Mother; another, That shee might not be put to death privately, but her servants to be present; the third That her servants might freely depart, and enjoy such Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacies as she had given them. Of which Requests, she desireth the Queen to vouchsafe her an answer; but whether this Letter ever came to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> is uncertain.</p>
            <p>This condemnation of the Queene of Scots, as a thing strange, and scarce credible, was soone spread farre and neare; so as inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions came thicke in her behalfe to Queene ELIZABETH, but specially from the King of Scots, and the King of FRANCE, who sent their severall Ambassadors, using all the reasons that naturall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in the one, and likenesse of condition in the other, could urge, for sparing of her life; but when the necessity of the State, seemed to obstruct all wayes of clemency, the French Ambassador <hi>L' Aubespine,</hi> falls from reasons to action, and thinketh no way so effectuall for sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Queen of Scots life, as to take away Queen ELIZABETHS life; and thereupon, First, he dealeth covertly with <hi>William Stafford,</hi> a young Gentleman, and prone to embrace hopes (whose Mother was of the Bed-chamber to Queen ELIZABETH, and his brother at that time, Ambassador Lieger in <hi>France</hi>) and afterward, more openly by <hi>Trappe</hi> his Secretary, to murther the Queen. <hi>Stafford,</hi> though not daring to act such a villany himselfe, yet commended one <hi>Moody</hi> to him, a resolute fellow, and one that for money would be sure to do it. Upon this, <hi>Stafford</hi> brings <hi>Trappe</hi> to <hi>Moody,</hi> being then in the common Gaole, who upon <hi>Trappes</hi> offers, undertakes it: But then the consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation was, by what way it should be done? <hi>Moody</hi> propounded poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, or else to lay a bagge of Gunpowder under the Queens Bed, and suddenly fire it. But <hi>Trappe</hi> liked of neither of these wayes, but would rather have it done, as was done to the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi> But while they are thus consulting about the way of doing it; <hi>Stafford</hi> discovers all to the Lords of the Councell. Whereupon <hi>Trappe,</hi> who was now bound for <hi>France,</hi> was apprehended, and being examined, confessed the whole matter. Upon this, the Ambassador himself was sent for to <hi>Cecills</hi> house, the twelveth of <hi>Ianuary</hi>; where met him by the Queens appointment, <hi>Cecill</hi> Lord Treasurer, the Earl of <hi>Leicester,</hi> Sir <hi>Christopher Hatton</hi> Vice-Chamberlain, and <hi>Davyson</hi> one of her Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretaries; who declare to the Ambassador every particular which <hi>Stafford, Moody,</hi> and <hi>Trappe</hi> his Secretary had confessed. Assoone as <hi>Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> was brought forth, and began to speake, the AMBASSADOR interrupted him, and revyling him, made asseveration, that <hi>St<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But whosoever propounded it (sayth BVRLEIGH) It appeares, that you were made acquainted with the matter. To which hee presently Replyed; That if hee had knowne of any such thing, yet, being he was an AMBASSADOVR, he o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ght not
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:52616:271"/>
to give notice of it, but to his own King. After much reasoning in this manner; The Lord <hi>Burleigh</hi> admonished him, to beware how he offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded hereafter in this kinde; and let him know, That he is not quitted from the offence, though for this time the Queen be pleased to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear him.</p>
            <p>But upon this Treason, the Queen of Scots Adversaries put many ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors into Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> minde, giving out, That the Spanish Navy was come to <hi>Milford</hi> Haven, That the Scots were broken into <hi>England,</hi> That the Duke of <hi>Guyse</hi> with a great Army was landed in <hi>Sussex,</hi> That the Queen of Scots was escaped out of Prison, and had gotten a Company up in Arms, and many other such feigned suggestions; Through which, at length they drew the Queen to this: That she sealed Letters, for executing the Sentence against the Queen of Scots; and one of her greatest perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to it (as the Scots reported) was one whom the King of Scots had sent to disswade her from it; namely, <hi>Patricke Grey,</hi> who sounded often in her ears, <hi>Mortua non mordet</hi>; when she is dead, she cannot bite.</p>
            <p>The Queen notwithstanding, began to weigh with her self, whether it were better to rid her out of the way, or else to spare her; and many great reasons offered themselves on both sides, but where only speculative reasons presented themselves for sparing her; many practicall reasons, and those pressed both by Courtiers and Preachers, were presented to her; so as long holden in suspence, she would oftentimes sit speechlesse, and her countenance cast down: At last, her fear prevayling, she delivered to Secretary <hi>Davyson,</hi> Letters under her hand and Seal, to get the Commission made under the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> for the Execution of the Queen of Scots, which might be in a readinesse upon any fear of danger; charging him not to disclose the matter, to any whomsoever. But the next day her minde was altered, and sent Sir <hi>William Killegrew</hi> to <hi>Davyson,</hi> to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the making of the Commission. Whereupon <hi>Davyson</hi> goes to her, and lets her know, That the Commission was already made, and the Seal put to it; Whereat, the Queen extreamly angry, rebuketh him sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for his hastinesse; yet <hi>Davyson</hi> imparteth the matter to Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors; and perswades them, That the Queen Commanded, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission should be put in execution. Hereupon, <hi>Beale</hi> Clerk of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, is sent down with Letters, wherein authority is deputed to the Earls of <hi>Shrewsbury, Kent, Derby, Cumberland,</hi> and others, that she should be put to death according to the Law; with which proceeding, the Queen was not once made acquainted; and more than this, Although she had intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>Davyson,</hi> That she would take some other order concerning the Queen of Scots, yet did not he stay <hi>Beale</hi> from going.</p>
            <p>And now comes in the last Act of the Queen of Scots Tragedy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> for assoon as the Earls were come to <hi>Fotheringay</hi>; They, together with Sir <hi>Amis Pawlet,</hi> and Sir <hi>Drue Drurie,</hi> with whom she was then in custody; go unto her, and reading the Commission, signifie the cause of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming; and in a few words, admonish her to prepare her selfe for death, for that she must dye the next day. Whereto, without any change of countenance or passion of minde, she made Answer; I had not thought that my Sister the Queen, would have consented to my death, who am not subject to your Laws; but since it is her pleasure, death shall then be to me most welcome. Then she requesteth that she might conferre with her Confessor, and <hi>Melvyn</hi> her Steward, which would not be granted: The Bishop or Deane of <hi>Peterborough</hi> they offered her, but them she refused. The Earles being departed, she gave or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Supper should bee hastened, where shee eat (as she used to doe) soberly, and sparingly; and perceiving her men and women servants to lament and weepe, she comforteth them, and bid them rejoyce rather,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:52616:271"/>
that she was now to depart out of a world of misery. After supper, she looketh over her Will, read the Inventory of her Goods and Jewells, and writ their names severally by them, to whom she gave any of them; at her wonted hour she went to bed, and after a few hours sleep, awaking; spent the rest of the night in her devotion. And now the fatall day being come, wich was the 8 of <hi>February,</hi> she getteth up, and makes her ready in her best Apparell, and then betook her self in her Closet to Almighty God, imploring his assistance with deep sighes and groans; untill <hi>Thomas Andrews</hi> Sheriffe of the County gave notice, that it was time to come forth, and then with a Princely Majesty, and chearfull conntenance, she came out, her head covered with a linnen Vayl, and carrying an Ivory Crucifix in her hand; In the Gallery the Earls met her, and the other Gentlemen, where <hi>Melvyn</hi> her servant upon his bended knees, deplored his own fortune, that he should be the messenger to carry this sad newes into <hi>Scotland</hi>; whom she comforted saying, Do not lament <hi>Melvyn,</hi> Thou shalt by and by see <hi>Mary Steward</hi> freed from all cares. Then turning her self to the Earls, She requested that her servants might stand by her at her death, which the Earl of Kent was very loath to grant, for fear of superstition; To whom she sayd, Fear nothing, these poor wretches desire only to give me my last farewell. I know the Queen my Sister, would not deny me so small a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest. After this, the two Earls, and the Sheriff of the County leading the way, she came to the Scaffold, which was set up at the upper end of the Hall, where was a Chayre, a Cushion, and a Block, all covered with Mourning. Then the Dean of <hi>Peterborough</hi> going to Prayers, she falling upon her knees, and holding up the Crucifix in both her hands, prayed with her Servants in Latine, out of the Office of the blessed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin. Prayers being ended, she kissed the Crucifix, and signing her self with the Sign of the Crosse, said, <hi>As thy arms, O Christ, were spread forth upon the Crosse, so embrace me with the open arms of thy mercy, and forgive me my sins.</hi> Then the Executioner asking her pardon, she forgave him. And now her women helping off her outer Garments, and break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth into shrikes and cryes, she kissed them, signed them with the Crosse, and willed them to leave lamenting, for now an end of her sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows was at hand; and then shadowing her face with a Linnen Cloth, and lying down on the Block, she repeated the Psalm, <hi>In te Domine speravi, ne confundar in aeternum</hi>; at which words she stretching forth her Body, her head at two blows was taken off. Her Body was afterward Royally buried in the Cathedrall Church at <hi>Peterborough</hi>; but since that, her No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Son <hi>Iames,</hi> King of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> erected a Royall Monument for her, in King <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh's Chappell at <hi>Westminster.</hi> This end had <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of Scots, in the six and fortieth yeer of her age, and of her Imprisonment in <hi>England</hi> the eighteenth; a Lady so compleat in all excellent parts of body and minde, that must needs have made her a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py woman, if she had not been a Queen; and perhaps a happy Queen too, if she had not been Heir to the Crown of <hi>England:</hi> For why did all her endeavours want successe, but onely from the fear of that Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; and no Innocency of heas could be a Defence, where the fury of Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie made the Assault.</p>
            <p>Assoon as it came to the Queens knowledge, that the Queen of Scots was put to death, her countenance grew dejected, and her speech fayled her; insomuch that all in mourning weeds, she gave her self over to sorrow, Commanded her Councellors from her Presence, and caused <hi>Davyson</hi> to be cited to the Starchamber. And assoon as grief would suffer her, She wrote a Letter with her own hand to the King of Scots, and sent it by Sir <hi>Robert Cary,</hi> to this effect; That her minde was infinitely disquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in regard of this lamentable event, against her meaning and intent;
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:52616:272"/>
entreating him to believe, That if she had commanded it, she would never have denyed it, and withall, Protesting her true affection towards him, and her assiduous watchfulnesse for the prospering of his affairs.</p>
            <p>While <hi>Carye</hi> was on his journey, <hi>Davyson</hi> is cited to the Star-Chamber before these Delegates, Sir <hi>Christopher Wray</hi> Chiefe Justice of the Kings-Bench, for that time made Lord Privy Seal, the Archbishop; of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>York,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Worcester, Cumberland,</hi> and <hi>Lincolne,</hi> the Lords <hi>Grey,</hi> and <hi>Lumley,</hi> Sir <hi>Iames Croft,</hi> Comptroller of the Queens House, Sir <hi>Walter Mildmay,</hi> Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir <hi>Edmond Anderson,</hi> Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, and Sir <hi>Roger Manwood,</hi> Lord Chief Baron (where note, That <hi>Bromely</hi> Lord Chancellor, <hi>Burleigh</hi> Lord Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer, <hi>Leicester,</hi> and <hi>Hatton,</hi> who were indeed more guilty of the fact, than <hi>Davyson,</hi> were none of the number.) Before these Delegates, <hi>Popham</hi> the Queens Atturney layeth to <hi>Davysons</hi> charge, Contempt of the Queen; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, violating of his trust, and neglect of his duty, laying open all parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of his fact; which after <hi>Egerton</hi> the Queens Solicitor, <hi>Gawdy,</hi> and <hi>Puckering</hi> her Serjeants at Law, urged also against him with great aggra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: To which <hi>Davyson</hi> mildely answered, That he would not contest with the Queen; only protests, That if he had done any thing otherwise than he ought, it was out of ignorance and mistaking, and not out of any purpose to disobey her Majesty. It seems the Queen had carried her selfe, as one that would have it done, and yet was loth to do it, scarce knowing her one minde, and yet would have another know it; meaning to make it the work of mistaking, rather than of purpose, that so at least she might leave some place of satisfaction to her selfe, that it was not absolutely of her doing.</p>
            <p>The Pleadings ended, the Commissioners went to censure; <hi>Manwood</hi> began, and gave his opinion, That <hi>Davyson,</hi> for the inconsideratnesse of his fact<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> should be fined ten thousand pounds, and Imprisonment during the Queens pleasure; the rest went on in that Sentence, only the Lord <hi>Grey</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused <hi>Davyson</hi> so far, That he tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ght him worthy of reward, rather than of punishment: The conclusion was, the first Sentence for his Fine and Imprisonment, was by <hi>Wray</hi> keeper of the Privy Seal confirmed; and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyson</hi> never after recovered the Queens favour, though she relieved him sometimes in his necessity. A man ingenious indeed, but not throughly acquainted with the wayes of the Court; and thought to have been raised to this place, of purpose to Act this part, and for nothing else.</p>
            <p>By this time Sir <hi>Robert Cary,</hi> Son to the Lord <hi>Hunsdon,</hi> who was sent to excuse the Queen, was come to the Borders; but being come thither, was not suffered to set foot in <hi>Scotland,</hi> The King would scarce hear him by another, and with much adoe received his Letters. He called home his Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor out of <hi>England,</hi> and thought of nothing but revenge.</p>
            <p>But the Queen still laying the fault upon <hi>Davyson,</hi> and the unadvised cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity of her Councellros, by little and little allayeth his passion; and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting, till time had somewhat asswaged his griefe, that it would endure to be touched, at length, by her Agents in <hi>Scotland</hi>; And soon after by the Lord <hi>Hunsdon</hi> Governor of <hi>Berwicke,</hi> She admonished him, How dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous it would be for him, to break out into War against <hi>England,</hi> and what little help he could justly expect from either <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>France,</hi> but if he persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted in the amity with <hi>England,</hi> he might be sure the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> would most lovingly account him for her Son. And to the end, that he should assure himself, that the Queen his Mother was put to death without her privity, she sent him the Sentence against <hi>Davyson,</hi> under the Seals of all the Delegates, and attested under the Great Seal of <hi>England</hi>; and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Instrument likewise signed with the hands of the Judges of <hi>England</hi>; in which they averre, That the Sentence against the Queen of Scots, could in no wise be prejudice to his right in the Succession.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:52616:272"/>Having now by these and the like courses, somewhat asswaged the King of Scots indignation; to prevent the War which they foresaw was immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> they send forth <hi>Drake</hi> with four of the Queens ships and others, unto the Coast of <hi>Spain,</hi> to set upon their ships in the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thence setting sayl towards the Western Islands, called <hi>Azores,</hi> under the great Meridian; by great good fortune he happened upon an huge and wealthy Carack, called St. <hi>Philip,</hi> returning from the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> and easily vanquished it; Wherupon the Mariners on both sides, from the name of <hi>Philp,</hi> portended no good luck to <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Spain.</hi>

            <p>At the same time, <hi>Thomas Cavendish</hi> of <hi>Suffolke,</hi> in the other part of the World, who two years before had set sayl from <hi>England</hi> with three ships, passing thorough the Straights of <hi>Magellan,</hi> in the Coast of <hi>Chily, Peru,</hi> and <hi>Nu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Leicester</hi> being now come home, and perceiving that an accusation was preparing against him by <hi>Buckhurst</hi> and others, for his unfaithfull managing of affairs in <hi>Holland</hi>; privately with tears he cast himself down at the Queens feet, entreating her, that she would not receive him with disgrace, at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, whom she had sent forth with honor; and so far prevailed with her, that the next day being called to examination before the Lords, he took his place amongst them, not kneeling down at the end of the Table, as the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Delinquents is; and when the Secretary began to read the heads of his Accusation, he interrupted him, saying; That the publick instructions which he had received, were limited with private restriction; and making his appeal to the Queen, eluded the whole crimination, with the secret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation of his Adversaries.</p>
            <p>This year was famous for the death of many great Personages: In the moneth of <hi>February,</hi> dyed <hi>Henry Nevill</hi> Lord of <hi>Aburgaveny,</hi> great Grand-childe to <hi>Edward Nevill,</hi> who in the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, got this Title in the right of his Wife, only Daughter and Heir to <hi>Richard Beauchamp</hi> Earl of <hi>Worcester,</hi> and Lord of <hi>Aburgaveny</hi>; In which right, when as the only Daughter of this <hi>Henry,</hi> Wife to Sir <hi>Thomas Fane,</hi> challenged the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Baronesse of <hi>Aburgaveny</hi>; a memorable contention arose concerning the Title between her, and the next Heir Male, to whom by Will (and the same confirmed by Authority of Parliament) the Castle of <hi>Aburgaveny</hi> was bequeathed. This question being a long time debated; at last in a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment holden in the second year of King <hi>Iames,</hi> the matter was tryed by voyces; and the Heir Male carried the Lordship of <hi>Aburgaveny,</hi> and the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rony <hi>Le Dispencer,</hi> was ratified to the Female. This year also, in the moneth of <hi>Aprill,</hi> dyed <hi>Anne Stanhope</hi> Dutchesse of <hi>Somerset,</hi> ninety years old, who being the Wife of <hi>Edward Seymer</hi> Duke of <hi>Somerset,</hi> and Protector of <hi>England,</hi> contended for precedency, with <hi>Katherine Parre,</hi> Queen Dowager to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight. There dyed also, Sir <hi>Ralph Sadler,</hi> Chancellor of the Dutchy of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> the last Baneret of <hi>England,</hi> with which dignity he was adorned at the Battell of <hi>Musselborough</hi> in <hi>Scotland.</hi> After him dyed <hi>Thomas Bromley</hi> Lord Chancellor of <hi>England</hi>; and six dayes after, He, whom the Queen meant should have succeeded him, <hi>Edward</hi> Earl of <hi>Rut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; but he now fayling, Sir <hi>Christopher Hatton</hi> was made Lord Chancellor, who though he were a Courtier, yet the Queen knowing him to be an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest man, thought him not unfit for that place, where conscience hath, or should have more place than Law; although some were of opinion, That it was not so much the Queens own choice, as that she was perswaded to it by some that wisht him not well; both thereby to be a cause of absen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him from the Court, and thinking that such a sedentary place, to a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulent man that had been used to exercise, would be a means to shorten his life, and indeed he lived not full out three years after.</p>

            <p>The Spanish Navy consisted of one hundred and thirty Ships; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Galeasses and Galleons, seventy two, goodly Ships, like to floating Towers; in which were Souldiers, 19290; Marriners, 8350; Gally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaves, 2080; Great Ordnance, 2630: For the greater holinesse of their Action, twelve of their Ships were ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Queens Preparation in the mean time, was this; The Lord <hi>Charles Howard,</hi> Lord Admirall, with all her Navy; and Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> Vice-Admirall, to be ready at <hi>Plimouth</hi>; and the Lord <hi>Henry Seymor</hi> (second son to the Duke of <hi>Somerset,</hi> with forty English and Dutch Ships, to keep the Coasts of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> to hinder the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi>'s coming forth. Then for Land-Service, there were laid along the Southern Coast, twenty thousand souldiers, and two Armies besides of Trayned men were levyed; over one of which, consisting of a thousand Horse, and two and twenty thousand Foot, the Earl of <hi>Leicester</hi> commanded, and pitched his Tents at <hi>Tilbury,</hi> neer the Thames mouth: Over the other, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to Guard the Queens Person, and consisting of four and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thousand Foot, and two thousand Horse, the Lord <hi>Hunsdon</hi> was Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall. <hi>Arthur</hi> Lord <hi>Grey,</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Knolles,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Norris,</hi> Sir <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Bingham,</hi> Sir <hi>Roger Williams,</hi> and other Military men, were chosen to make a Councell of War, and consult how the Land-service should <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>At this time many fearing the Papists at home, no lesse than the Spa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And now all things on both sides prepared, the Spanish Navy set forth out of the <hi>Groyne</hi> in <hi>May,</hi> but was dispersed and driven back by weather. The English Navy set forth somewhat later out of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> bearing up towards the Coast of <hi>Spain</hi>; but partly by occasion of contrary windes, partly by advertisement that the Spaniards were gone back, and upon some doubt also that they might passe by towards the Coast of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> whilest they were seeking them afar off, they returned to <hi>Plimouth</hi>; At which time, a confident (though false) advertisement came to the Admirall, That the Spaniards could not possible come forward that yeer: whereupon the E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The next day, the English beheld the Spanish Ships, in height like to Castles, sayling slowly along, whom they suffered peaceably to passe by, that they might have the benefit of the winde to follow after. The one and twentieth day of <hi>Iuly,</hi> the Admirall of <hi>England</hi> sent a Pinnace before, called, <hi>The Defianc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then <hi>Drake, Hawkins,</hi> and <hi>Forbisher</hi> let fly against the outmost Squadron, which <hi>Recalde</hi> commanded, making him glad to fly to their main Navy for succour. The night following<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> a mighty <hi>Biskayner</hi> of <hi>Oquenda</hi>'s (in which the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Treasure was) was by chance fired with Gun-powder, but was timely quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by other Ships sent to her succour; one of which Ships, was the Galleon of Don <hi>Pedro,</hi> whom Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> took prisoner, and sent him to <hi>Darthmouth.</hi> The <hi>Biskayner</hi> it self (the Treasure being taken out by the Spaniards) they left behinde them, which the English brought into the Haven at <hi>Weymouth.</hi>

            <p>The five and twentieth day (which was the Saint <hi>Iames</hi> day) they fell to it the third time; in which Fight, the English had again the better, so as after this time, the Spaniards would no more turne upon the English, but holding on their course, dispatched a Messenger to the

            <p>The day following, the Lord Admirall Knighted <hi>Thomas Howard,</hi> the Lord <hi>Shefield<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And now so far were the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish from being terrified with this invincible Navy, that many of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and other of speciall note, hired Ships at their own charges and came to the Admirall; as the Earls of Oxford, Northumberland, Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland, <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Robert Cecill, Henry Brook,</hi> Sir <hi>Charls Blunt,</hi> Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh,</hi> Sir <hi>William Hatton,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Carie,</hi> Sir <hi>Ambrose Willoughby,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Gerard,</hi> Sir <hi>Arthur Gorge</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>The seaven and twentieth of July towards the Evening, the Spaniards cast Anchour neer unto Calis, and not far from them rode the English Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall, within shot of a great Ordnance, to whom <hi>Seymor</hi> and <hi>Winter</hi> joyned themselve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, so as by this time there were in the English Navy a hundred and forty Ships, nimble and serviceable for Fighting or Sayling, yet only Fifteen of them bore the stroke of the Battell. And now againe the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards sent Post after Post to the Prince of Parma to send them forty Flye-boates, without which they were not able to skirmish with the English, by reason of the greatnesse and unweldinesse of their Ships, and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune him presently to put to Sea with his Army; But he was unprepa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The eight and twentieth day; the Lord Admirall made ready eight of his worst Ships, on the out-side dawbed with wild-fire, Rozin and Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, within, full of combustible matter, and under the conduct of <hi>Young</hi> and <hi>Prowse,</hi> sent them down with the winde in the silent time of the night towards the Spanish Fleet; the which when the Spaniards saw approach them, and the Sea as it were all on a light fire; imagining withall, that those Fire-ships might carry in them some murthering Engines, they made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And now the Spanish Navy having want of many nec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Whilest these things passed at Sea, the Queen <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n Person came to Tilbury to view the Army and Campe there, where she shewed such undaunted Courage and Resolution, that it wonderfully ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated the spirits of them all.</p>
            <p>And thus this Navy, which was three whole Yeers in preparing, in the space of a month was often beaten, and at length put to flight, many of

their men being slain, more then halfe of their Ships taken and sunk (of the English not above a hundred at the most missing, nor so much as a Ship, but <hi>Cocks</hi> little Vessell) and Sayling about all Brittaine by Scotland, the Orkeneys and Ireland, they returned into Spain with as much disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour as they came out with boasting, for indeed <hi>Mendoza</hi> in France by a Book in Print, Triumphed before the Victory.</p>
            <p>For the happy successe of this Action, Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> appointed pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and thanksgiving over all the Churches of England, and she (as it were in triumph) came in Person, attended with a great Troop of the Nobility into the City, and went into the Cathedrall Church of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> (where the Banners taken from the Enemy was placed in view) and there in most humble manner gave thanks to Almighty God.

               </gap>hat which increased the publike joy, was the newes which Sir <hi>Robert Sidney</hi> brought out of Scotland, That the King had over-past all injuries, was lovingly affected towards the English, and desired to imbrace sincere and perfect amitie with the Queen. For as for the King of Spain, he wittily told the Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, that he expected no other courtesie from him, but such as <hi>Polyphemus</hi> promised <hi>Ulisses,</hi> that he should be the last whom he would devoure.</p>
            <p>And now dyed the great Earl of Leicester the fourth day of Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, at his Mannor of Killingworth of a violent Feaver; I may well say the great Earl, considering the many great Honours he enjoyed, which are extant in the Story; yet one honour greater then any he had before, he effected even then when he was ready to go out of the world, and that was<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He was while he lived in so great favour with the Queen, that some thought (and himselfe not the least) that she meant to marry him; yet when he dyed, his goods were sold at an Outcry to make payment of the debts he owed her.</p>
            <p>About this time <hi>Philip</hi> Earl of Arundell, who three yeers before had been cast in prison, was now cited in Westminster Hall, to the judgement of his Peers, and <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of Derby was made High Steward of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land for the time. The matters layd to his charge were these: That he had contracted friendship with Cardinall <hi>Allen, Parsons</hi> the Jesuite, and other Traytours, exciting divers both abroad and at home to restore the Romish Religion, promising his assistance thereunto: and for that reason had a purpose to depart the Kingdom. That he was privy to the Bull, in which Pope <hi>Sixtus Quintus</hi> had deposed the Queen, and given England to the Spaniard; that being imprisoned in the Tower he caused Masse to be said for the prosperous successe of the Spanish Fleet, and for that purpose had framed peculiar prayers for his own private use. Being demanded whether he were guilty of these things; turning himself to the Judges, he asked them these questions: First, whether it were lawfull to heap up so many crimes together in one Bill of Indictment? They answered that it was: Then whether Arguments taken from presumptions were of force? They answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that it was lawfull for him to interpose exceptions if he saw cause. Then again, if he might be Arraigned for those things which were Capitall, by the Law made the thirteenth yeer of the Queen, after that the time expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the Act was expired?

            <p>It concerns the state of England, to look at this time into the state of France; for while those things were in doing between Spain and England, the Popish Princes of France, under pretext of defending the Catholike Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, entred into a combination, which they called, <hi>The holy League:</hi> The purpose whereof was, to root out the Protestants, and to divert the Right of Succession to the Crown of France; For they bound themselves to each other by oath, to suffer no person but a Catholike to be King of France; which was directly to exclude the King of Navarre, and the Prince of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, if the present King, without issue male, should fail. The head of this League, was the Duke of Guise, who having given some overthrows to the German Forces, that came into France in aid of the Protestants, was immea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surably extolled by the Clergie and others; and grew to such a height of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, that entring into Paris, he made the King glad to leave the City, and in an Assembly at Bloys, to make him great Master of the French Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, and to consent by Edict, to the cutting off the Protestants. So as the King standing now in fear of him, used means at last, even in the very Court, to have him murthered; and soon after, the Cardinall his brother

The Confederates in the mean while, made a new Seal, usurped the Royall Authority, seized into their hands the best fortified places, intercept the Kings Revenues, call in Spanish Souldiers, and in all places denounce war and violence against the King.

            <p>The King of Navarre being thus raised in Dignity, but weake in means, implored Aid of the Queen of England, offering to make a League Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive and Defensive; the Queen out of a pious respect to a King of her own Religion, sent him presently two and twenty thousand pound sterling in Gold (such a summe of Gold, as he professed he had never seen at one time before) and withall supplyed him with four thousand Souldiers, under the command of <hi>Peregrine</hi> Lord <hi>Willoughby</hi>; for Colonells, she appointed Sir <hi>Thomas Wilford,</hi> who was made Marsh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

After him dyed <hi>George Talbot,</hi> the seventh E. of Shrewsbury of this house; he was made Earl Marshall of England, and left behinde him a memoriall of Wisdom and Integrity. Lastly dyed <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Wentworth,</hi> the last of the English that had been Governour of Calice.</p>
            <p>In Ireland at this time <hi>Hugh Gaveloc</hi> (so called, because he had been long kept in Fetters) the naturall son of <hi>Shan O Neale,</hi> accused <hi>Hugh</hi> Earl of Tir-Oen, for holding private consultations with certain Spaniard, who in 88 were by Shipwrack cast upon the coast of Ireland: <hi>Tir-Oen</hi> to prevent the Accusation, took the said <hi>Hugh,</hi> and when others refused to do it, took a cord and with his own hands strangled him. Hereupon he was sent for into England, and came, and upon pardon obtained, solemnly undertook in presence of the Queen at Greenwich, to maintain the peace with <hi>Turlogh Leynigh</hi>; Not to usurpe the Title of <hi>O-Neale,</hi> nor any authority over the Gentry about him; to reduce the Territory of <hi>Tir-Oen</hi> to the form of a County, and civil behaviour, and many such matters; giving hostages for his true performance; and indeed for a time he observed all things very duly. This trouble allayed, another arose; for soon after this, <hi>Hugh Roe Mac-Mahon,</hi> a Potentate in the Territory of Monaghan, compelled those under his juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to pay him tribute; whereupon the Deputy caused him to be taken, and tryed by a Jury of common Souldiers, and then to be hanged up, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his lands amongst certain English; and some of the <hi>Mac-Mahons,</hi> reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:52616:277"/>
a certain yeerly Rent to the Crown of England, by this means thinking to extinguish the Power and Title of <hi>Mac-Mahon.</hi> But hereupon, <hi>O-Rork,</hi> fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hee should be served in like manner, took up Arms against the Queen, whom <hi>Bingham</hi> President of Connacht soon distressed, and drave into Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and at the Queens request, was by the King delivered up into his hands.</p>
            <p>It was now the yeer 1591. and the Four and thirtieth of Queen <hi>Elisabeths</hi> Raign, when she, carefull lest Britain should come into the Spaniards hands, sent <hi>Edmund York</hi> into France, to advertise the King to take care thereof; and promising to send him Forces to that end, if he would, some Towns, where they might be in safety. Hereupon he named <hi>Cherburg, Granvile,</hi> or <hi>Brest,</hi> as the fittest; and it was agreed, that Three thousand English should be sent into Brittainy and Picardy; but in the mean time, <hi>Henry Palmer</hi> was sent to Sea, with certain Ships, who seized upon Thirteen Spanish Ships, as they were returning from <hi>Nova Francia.</hi> And now <hi>Roger Williams,</hi> with a Company of Six hundred Souldiers, passeth over to Diepe in Normandy; and Sir <hi>Iohn Norris</hi> with the rest of the Forces, hasted into Britain soon after. <hi>Roger Williams,</hi> with his own Six hundred, and the help of <hi>Charter</hi> Governour of Diepe, put to rout the Confederates, that had blocked up the passages; whose valour, the French King in his Letters to the Queen, highly extolled. Whereupon growing more couragious, and not minding his charge, which was to stay at Diepe, he accompanyed the King to the very Suburbs of Paris, where in honour of his Nation, he sent a Challenge to the Spaniards, to encounter Two hundred Pikemen of the English, and a hundred Musque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, with as many Spaniards in open Field.</p>
            <p>After this, the King of France acquainted the Queen, that he had a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to set upon Roan, or New-haven, before the Prince of Parma should come into France, and thereupon requested her, to send Four thousand Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish into Normandy, which upon certain conditions she willingly did, and sent them under the Command of <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When the Earl came into France, he found that the King was at Noyon, and in Normandy no preparation for the War at all, which seemed strange, and much troubled him; but by and by Sir <hi>Roger Williams</hi> comes to him from the King, requesting him to come to Noyon, that they might confer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a course of War.

And this they proclaimed in Cheapside; giving out that <hi>Hacket</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipated of Christs glorified body, by his especiall Spirit, and was now come to propagate the Gospel over Europe, and to settle a true Discipline in the Church of England; and that they themselves were two Prophets, the one of Mercie, and the other of Judgement; with many other such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible blasphemies; whereupon <hi>Hacket</hi> was apprehended and arraigned; and at last, hanged, drawn and quartered, continuing all the time, and at his death, his blasphemous Assertions. <hi>Coppinger</hi> a while after starved himself to death in prison, <hi>Arthington</hi> repented, and made his Recantation in a publike writing.</p>
            <p>Besides these, other also at this time opposed the established Government of the Church of England, crying down the calling of Bishops, with whom sided some Common-Lawyers also, affirming, that the Queen could not depute, nor these men exercise any such Ecclesiasticall Jurisdiction; and that the Oath <hi>Ex Officio</hi> was unchristian. But the Queen conceiving, that through the sides of the Prelates, she her self was shot at, suppressed them what she could, and maintained the Government formerly established.</p>
            <p>About this time, the Lord <hi>Thomas Howard,</hi> with six of the Queens ships, having waited at the Azores six whole Moneths, for the coming of the Spanish Fleet from America, was at last set upon by <hi>Alphonso Bassano,</hi> with three and fifty ships, sent out for the Convoy of the American Fleet, where <hi>Richard Granvile</hi> Vice-Admirall, being in the <hi>Revenge,</hi> and separated from his company, was so hemmed in by the Spanish ships, and so battered with great shot; that most of his men being slain, his Main-mast cut off, himself sore wounded in the head, he commanded to sink the ship, that it might not come into the Spaniards hands; but this being countermanded by most voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, it was agreed, to yeeld it to the Spaniards, upon condition that the men should be set at liberty. <hi>Granvile</hi> himself was carryed into the Spanish Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall, where within two dayes he dyed, not without praise of his very ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: Thus the great ship called the <hi>Revenge,</hi> was yeelded, but had so many leaks in the Ke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>l, that soon after it was cast away in a storm; and the losse of this one ship the English soon made good upon the Spaniards, by taking many of theirs.</p>
            <p>About this time also, <hi>Cavendish,</hi> who in the yeer 1578. had sailed round about the world, now with five ships bent his course toward the Magellan Straits, but by reason of foul weather, was not able to passe them, being dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the coast of Brasile, was there cast away.</p>
            <p>And now, enmity increasing daily between Spain and England, two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations were set forth; one, prohibiting upon pain of high-Treason, to carry Victuals or Munition into any of the King of Spains dominions: An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, forbidding all persons to entertain any in their houses, till inquiry made, what they were, lest they might entertain Popish Priests, who at this time came swarming into England, by reason the King of Spain had lately founded a Seminary at Valledolid for the English.</p>
            <p>At this time dyed Sir <hi>Christopher Hatton,</hi> Lord Chancelour, whom of a mean Gentlemans house, the Queens favour had raised to this height of Dignity; a goodly personage of body, of Noble, but no aspiring spirits; the onely of all the Queens speciall Favourites, that dyed a Batchelour; and therefore left <hi>William Newport</hi> his sisters son his heir, who erected for him, in <hi>Pauls</hi> Church, a sumptuous Monument. After his death, the keeping
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:52616:278"/>
of the great Seal was for certain Moneths committed to the Lord <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh</hi> Treasurer, <hi>Hunsdon, Cobham</hi> and <hi>Buckhurst:</hi> Afterward, <hi>Puckering</hi> the Queens Sergeant at Law was elected, not Chancelour, but Keeper of the great Seal.</p>
            <p>At this time also, <hi>Brian O-Rork,</hi> the Irish Potentate, was arraigned at Westminster; his Indictments were, For raising Rebellion against the Queen, for dragging her Picture at a horse tail, for giving the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards entertainment; which things being told him by an Interpreter, (for he understood no English) hee said, Hee would not be tryed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse the Queen her self in person sate to judge him. Yet being told, that it was the Law; hee onely said, If it must be so, let it be so; and so condemned, was executed at Tyburn as a Traitour, whereof hee seemed to make as little reckoning, as if it had but been in jest. And now this yeer, the Queen made the Colledge of Dublin in Ireland, an University, which was formerly the Monastery of All-Saints, endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with power to confer Scholasticall Dignities.</p>
            <p>At this time, Sir <hi>Iohn P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To the first of which he confessed, that in his passion he had spoken of the Queen unadvisedly, for which hee was infinitely grieved; the rest hee denyed: And all men knew, he was never Popishly affected. His Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusers were, one <hi>Philip Williams,</hi> sometime his Secretary; <hi>Denys O-Rog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han</hi> an Irish marryed Priest, whose life hee had saved; and one <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> a fellow of no worth or Reputation.

            <p>And now the King of France, hearing that the Prince of Parma was coming i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But as for the Prince of Parma's coming into France, hee was prevented by death, when hee had governed the Netherlands under the Spaniard fourteen yeers; a Prince of many excellent parts, and whom Queen <hi>Elisabeth</hi> never mentioned but with honour.</p>
            <p>And now Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> considering that the King of Spaines chiefe strength was in his Gold of America, sends forth Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> with a Fleet of fifteene Ships to meete with the Spanish Fleet; who

This great Vessell they took, and in it, to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>This yeare, the Queene going in Progresse, passed through <hi>Oxford,</hi> where she was entertained by the Schollers with Orations, Stage-Pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>yes, and Disputations; and by the Lord <hi>Buckhurst</hi> Chancellor of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity, with a sumptuous Feast. At her departure, She made a Latine Oration, wherein she vowed a vow, and gave them counsell; Her vow was, That as she desired nothing so much, as the prosperity and flourishing estate of her Kingdome, so she as much wished to see the Universities and Schools of learning to flourish likewise. Her Counsell was, That they would serve God above all, not following the curiosity of some wits, but the Lawes of God, and the Kingdome, That they would not prevent the Lawes, but follow them, nor dispute whether better Lawes might be made, but observe those which were already Enacted.</p>
            <p>This year, dyed <hi>Anthony Browne</hi> Viscount <hi>Montacute,</hi> whom Queene <hi>Mary</hi> honored with this Title; because his Grandmother was Daughter, and one of the Heirs of <hi>Iohn Nevill</hi> Marquesse <hi>Montacute</hi>; who, though he were a great Roman Catholike, yet the Queen finding him faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full alwayes, loved him, and in his sicknesse went to visit him.

            <p>At this time <hi>Henry Barrow,</hi> and his Sectaries, condemning the Church of <hi>England</hi> to be no Christian Church, and derogating from the Queens Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in matters Ecclesiasticall; he the sayd <hi>Barrow,</hi> as Ring-leader of the rest, was put to death, in terror to all such disturbers of the peace of the Church.</p>
            <p>About this time, by reason of the Queens correspondence with the <hi>Turk,</hi> to the end, her Subjects might have free Trading in his Territories; It was maliciously given out by some, that she had excited the <hi>Turke</hi> to a War against the Christians; which caused the Queen to write to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, shewing him the falsenesse of this report, wherein she gave him full sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>And now a constant report came into <hi>England,</hi> That the King of <hi>France</hi> had already embraced, or was ready to embrace the Romish Religion, which so much troubled the Queene, that she presently sent <hi>Thomas Wilkes</hi> into <hi>France</hi>; with reasons (if it were not too late) to divert him from it. But before <hi>Wilkes</hi> came, the King indeed had openly professed the Romish Religion, at the Church of Saint <hi>Denis</hi> in <hi>Paris</hi>; of which his Conversion, he declared the causes to <hi>Wilkes</hi> at large, shewing, the necessity of it, unlesse he would suffer himselfe to be utterly thrust out of the Kingdome. And the French AMBASSADOR signifying as much to the Queene, in great perplexity, She writ to him to this effect.</p>

            <p>To this the KING Answered, That though he had done this in his owne Person out of necessity; yet, He would never be wanting to those of the Reformed Religion, but would take them into his speciall care and Protection.</p>

               </gap> Raigne; when the good correspondence betweene the King of Scots and Queen ELIZABETH, gave the Papists small hope that ever he would prove an Instrument to restore the Catholike Religion. Whereupon, they began to bethinke themselves of some English Papist, that might succeed the Queene; but finding none of their owne Sect, a fit person, they fixed their thoughts upon the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> who alwayes seemed a very moderate man; and him they devised to have some right to the Crowne, by Descent from <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Woodstocke,</hi> King EDVVARD the Thirds Sonne. But the English Fugitives, were for the Infanta of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and desiring to set the King of Scots and the Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> at ods; they set forth a Book, which they Dedicated to <hi>Essex,</hi> under the name of <hi>Doleman,</hi> but was written indeed by <hi>Parsons</hi> (<hi>Dolemans</hi> bitter Adversary) Cardinall <hi>Allen,</hi> and <hi>Francis Englefield.</hi> The scope of which Booke was, to exclude from Succession, all persons whatsoever, and how near soever Allied to the Crowne, unlesse they were Roman Catholikes; Contending further, for the right of <hi>Isabella,</hi> Infanta of <hi>Spaine,</hi> as being descended from <hi>Constance,</hi> Daughter of WILLIAM the Conquerour; from <hi>Eleanor</hi> eldest Daughter to HENRY the Second, Married to <hi>Alphonso</hi> the ninth King of <hi>Castile</hi>; from <hi>Beatrix,</hi> Daughter to King HENRY the Third, Titles obsolete, and which exceed the bounds of Heraldry to discusse.

            <p>But now greater matters were in hand, Plots were layd against the Queenes life; some Spaniards thinking to make her away by Poison, and not daring to trust any Englishman in such a businesse; they treat to that purpose, with <hi>Rodericke Lopes</hi> a JEV<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Master of his Horse was much suspected, who the same day the Earl tooke his bed, took one of his best Horses, and fled away.

            <p>And now Sir <hi>William Fitz Williams</hi> Lord Deputy of <hi>Ireland</hi> was called home, and <hi>William Russell</hi> youngest Son of <hi>Francis</hi> Earl of <hi>Bedford,</hi> was sent in his room; to whom presently came the Earl of <hi>Tir-Oen,</hi> and in hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble manner craved pardon of his fault, that he had not presented himself at the call of the late Lord Deputy. <hi>Bagnall</hi> Marshall of the Irish Forces, exhibited many Articles against him, but he so pleaded for himself with promise of loyalty hereafter, that he was dismissed. But see the subdolous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of this man, for he would never after be gotten to come again, though the Deputy sent for him with many kinde messages.</p>
            <p>It was now the year 1595, and the eight and thirtieth year of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Raign; when <hi>Ed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>At this time a constant rumor was blown abroad from all parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> that the Spaniards were coming again against <hi>England,</hi> with a farre greater Fleet than that in Eighty Eight, and that it was already under sayl; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, Souldiers were levyed, and placed on the Sea-coast. Two Navies were made ready, one to expect them at home in the Channell; the other, to go for <hi>America,</hi> under <hi>Hawkins</hi> and <hi>Drake</hi>; but when all came to all, it was but certain Spaniards, who loosed from the sea-coast of <hi>France,</hi> with four Gallies, which betimes in the morning landing in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> fired a Church standing alone in the fields, and three Villages of Fishermen, <hi>Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyne, Moushole,</hi> and <hi>Pensaus,</hi> and then presently retyred, not taking or killing any one person; And these were the first and last Spaniards, that in hostile manner <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And now mischiefs growing daily in <hi>France,</hi> a great number perswaded the King, to conclude a Peace with <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Queen her self began to mistrust him; especially, having lately received intelligence out of the Popes Conclave; that he was received into the bosome of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> with the Popes Benediction, and that upon conditions prejudiciall to the Protestants.</p>
            <p>And therefore at this time, were divers undertakings of the English against <hi>Spain</hi>; Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> Captain of the Guard, having defloured a Mayd of Honor (whom afterward he married) had lost the Queens favour, and was held in Prison for certain moneths; but afterward being set at liberty, though banished the Court.

            <p>At this time the Queen made known to the States in the Low-Countries, the great charges she had been at in relieving them ten yeers together; for which she requiteth some considerable recompence: The States again al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge the great charges they were at in Eighty Eight, in repelling the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> in her cause; yet (not to fall out about the matter) they were content to allow some reasonable retribution; but yet for the present, nothing was concluded.

            <p>In <hi>Ireland</hi> at this time, <hi>Russell</hi> the Deputy doubting a storm of War from <hi>Tir-Oen,</hi> sent into <hi>England,</hi> requiring to have some experienced souldier sent to him with Forces, who though he desired <hi>Baskervyle</hi> to be the man, yet

Sir <hi>Iohn Norris</hi> was sent, with thirteen hundred old souldiers, besides a further supply; whom <hi>Tir-Oen</hi> hearing to be coming, set presently upon the Fort of <hi>Blackwater,</hi> and in the absence of <hi>Edward Cornwall</hi> the Governour, took it. But now being doubtfull of his case, in a subdolous manner (as he was a double dealing man) he both offereth his help to the Earl of <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dare,</hi> against the Deputies servants; and at the same time, maketh promise to the Earl of <hi>Ormond,</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Wallope,</hi> of loyalty and obedience; but notwithstanding he was forthwith proclaimed Traytor, under the name of <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Whereupon the Deputy returned, leaving <hi>Norris</hi> to follow the War, with the Title of Generall of the Army. But this satisfied not <hi>Norris,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore out of emulation betwixt himself &amp; the Deputy, he performed nothing worth the speaking of, and seemed to favour <hi>Tir Oen,</hi> as much as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty hated him; insomuch, as he had private conference with him (a thing not lawfull with proclaymed Traytors) and upon his submission, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stages given, a Truce was granted both to him and <hi>Odonell,</hi> till the first of <hi>Ian<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In consulting about which Petitions, another Truce was concluded, till the first of <hi>April:</hi> during which Truce, <hi>Tir Oen</hi> dealt secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the King of <hi>Spain</hi> for Ayd to be sent him, making neverthelesse a fair shew of willingnesse to obedience, so far, that by the procurement of <hi>Norris</hi> and <hi>Fenton,</hi> a pardon was granted him; the which he pretended to receive more joyfully, than the Instrument whicd conferred the Earldome upon him; yet all this was but dissimulation, to win the time for his own ends.</p>
            <p>In the midst of these Irish Affairs, <hi>Albertus</hi> Arch-Duke of <hi>Austria,</hi> and Cardinall, whom the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had newly set over the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> mustered together the Spanish Forces, upon pretence of raising the Siege of <hi>La Fere</hi> in <hi>Picardie</hi>; but upon a sudden turneth aside, and besiegeth <hi>Calice</hi>; and taking <hi>Newnham</hi> Fort, the very first day became Master of the Haven. The Queen informed hereof, forthwith, upon the very <hi>Sunday,</hi> in time of Divine Service, commandeth to leuy souldiers, whom she committeth to the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi>; but before they could be shipped, certain News came, That the Town and Fort were taken by the Spaniard: Whereupon, the Queens Army was dismissed, and onely some money lent to the French King.</p>
            <p>But a few dayes after, a far greater, and more select Army is raised in <hi>England,</hi> wherein many of Noble Houses served as Voluntaries: For the Queen, to divert the King of <hi>Spain</hi> from invading her Borders, thought it the best way to invade his: Whereupon a Navy of a hundred and fifty Ships was made ready; where were souldiers under pay, 6360; Volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Nobility and Gentry, 1000; Marriners, 6772, besides the Dutch-men, who brought two and twenty ships. <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> and <hi>Charls Howard</hi> Lord Admirall of <hi>England,</hi> were made Generalls with equall Authority; but the Admirall to hold Prerogative at Sea, <hi>Essex</hi> at Land.

The Gallyes quickly fled, and creeping along the shore, shifted away, but the Spanish ships that lay at Anchor at <hi>Puntall,</hi> turned their broad sides; so as the English Fight with them, lasted from break of day till noon; at which time, the Spaniards having their Gallons miserably tor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Spanish Admirall, being fifteen hundred Tun of Burthen, was fired by a <hi>Moor,</hi> and two other ships which lay next her took the fire, and were lost likewise. When this Sea-Fight was ended, <hi>Essex</hi> landed eight hundred souldiers at <hi>Puntall,</hi> a league from the Town of <hi>Cales,</hi> when half a mile from the Town, the Spanish Horse and Foot shewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and presently gave back again; but straightway cometh forth a greater number: Then <hi>Essex</hi> commanded his Forces to make a fair Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat; and having enticed forth their enemies, they turned upon them with such violence, that they forced them back into the Town.

In the Market place <hi>Iohn Winkfield</hi> was shot in the head, and with stones from the tops of the houses divers were wounded; amongst whom, <hi>Samuel Bagnall</hi> received eight wounds, and <hi>Arthur Savage</hi> was bloody all over; which two were Knighted in the place. The next day the Castle was yeelded, upon condition, That the Inhabitants might depart with the clothes on their backs, the rest to be left for spoyl. For five hundred and fourscore thousand Duckets the Castle was to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed; and for the payment, forty of the chief Citizens to be sent Hosta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges into <hi>England.</hi> Now <hi>Raleigh</hi> was commanded to fire the Merchants Ships lying at <hi>Port Reall,</hi> when they promised two Millions of Duckets to redeem them: but this the Admirall would not hear of, saying, He was sent to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy Ships, not to dismisse them upon Composition. A world of Munition was found in the City, and great store of money privately carried away, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one shifting for himself. It was thought by the wiser sort, That the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard could not be damnified lesse by this Expedition, than twenty Millions of Duckets. None of note was slain amongst the English, but onely <hi>Wink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> who also slew a Spanish Captain; and now at last, threescore Military men were honored with Knight-hood.

            <p>But the Queen at this time, for her better security, entred a League of Defence and Offence with the French King, against the Spaniard, upon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Conditions; which League, she confirmed by Oath, in the Chappell at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> the nine and twentieth of <hi>August,</hi> laying her hand upon the hand of <hi>Henry de la Tour,</hi> Duke of <hi>Bulloign,</hi> and Marshall of <hi>France</hi>; the Bishop of <hi>Chichester</hi> holding forth the Evangelists, and a great company of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility standing round about.

            <p>It was now the yeer, 1596, and the nine and thirtieth of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths</hi> Raign, when <hi>Thomas Arundel</hi> of <hi>Warder</hi> returned into <hi>England,</hi> from the Wars in <hi>Hungary</hi> against the Turk; whom, for his good service done there<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Those who are graced with this Title, have a Place and Voice in the Imperiall Diets, May purchase Lands in the Emperours Dominions, May take up voluntary souldiers, And are not bound to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer any matter before any Judge, but onely in the Chamber of the Empire. At his return, a great Question came in agitation, Whether Titles of Honour given to the Queens subjects without her privity, ought to be accepted by them, or admitted by her. For this new Earl stuck in the stomacks of the English Barons, who inwardly grudged to give him place. The matter was long disputed on both sides, but what issue it had, or whether he were permitted this Honour here at home, I finde not: Certain it is, That Sir <hi>Nicholas Clifford,</hi> and Sir <hi>Anthony Shirley,</hi> whom the French King two yeers since received into the Order of S. <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael,</hi> were laid in prison at their coming home, and charged to resigne their Robes of the Order.</p>

            <p>The Queen at this time was told, that the King of Spain was preparing a new Fleet against Ireland; whereupon to encounter him, she also prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a Navy of a hundred and twenty Ships, seventeene of the Queens, Three aud forty lesser Ships of Warre, the rest for the carriage of provision: They were parted into three Squadrons: <hi>Essex</hi> Commanded the first, who was also chiefe Commander in the expedition; The Lord <hi>Thomas Howard</hi> the second, and <hi>Raliegh</hi> the third.

And now the L. <hi>Thomas Howard</hi> mediated, that no severity might be used against <hi>Rawleigh,</hi> &amp; perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to acknowledge his fault; which being done, all were friends, and the displaced Captaines were restored to their places, for the Earle was of a placable disposition; easily apt to take offence, and as easily ready to remit it.</p>

               </gap> and then Essex landed within six miles of the Towne; nigh unto Villa Franca, a faire Towne, and well furnished with marchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize; wine, wood, and corne; where they tarried six dayes: and the common souldiers found good booty. And now a Caraque was espied, coming out of the east Indies; which, by a warning peece shot off in a Dutch ship, perceiveing that the English were there; run herselfe a shoare, unloaded her merchandize, and then fiered herselfe. Thus the English had ill lucke every where in this expedition: And the ninth of October they hoysted sayle for England; but within two dayes, a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible tempest, from the northward dispersed them; and the Spanish Fleete also at the same time, so as they never came in view of one another: one Spanish shippe was cast upon Dertmouth, the Marriners and souldiers halfe starved in her; who intimated, that the Spanish fleete in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to seize upon some haven in Cornwall, which being nigh the mouth of the channell; might be convenient to receive forces from Spaine: but the divine providence frustrated the designes both of the Spaniard and the English.</p>
            <p>But now at his returne, the Earle of Essex found that done in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, in his absence, which infinitly discontented him: Sir Robert Cicill made Chancelour of the Dutchy of Lancaster; &amp; which was more, Charles Lord Howard, created Earle of Nottingham, with relation in his patent to the Victory in eighty eight; and his good service at Cales: This glory he envyed him, and besides stomacked it; that he must now take place of him. It being enacted in the Raigne of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, that the chiefe Officers of the Kingdome, should have Presidence of all men of their degree. Whereupon the Queen, to give him content, was faine to create him Earle Marshall of England; by which he recovered his place againe.</p>
            <p>About this time, an Embassadour came into England, from the KING of Poland; who, when the Queen expected he should give her thanks for having procured a Peace between the King his Master, and the Turke, he cleane contrary expostulated unkindnesse, for breach of Priviledge in trading with Spaine, requiring a present remedy, or else the King would otherways right himselfe. The Queen not a little offended, suddenly replyed, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ow was I deceived? I expected an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour, and behold a Herauld; such a speech I never heard in all my life time: And after some further checking of him for his boldnesse, she referred him to her Councell; and then retired into her Closett. The Embassadour afterward, in private conference with some of the Councell, excused himselfe, saying, that his speech was pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by others, and then given him in wrighting. To his Message, the Councell gave the like answer; as they had given before the Hanse-Townes, upon the like occasion: though now againe, the Hanse-Townes obtaine of the Emperour, to prohibite the English from trading
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:52616:283" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in Germany, which made the Queen to prohibit the Hause towns from tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in England, and put them out of the Stilyard till this difference was accorded.</p>
            <p>This yeer the Chancellor of Denmarke came into England to restore the Garter, which she had bestowed upon the Kings Father, and withall offering the Kings helpe, to make a peace for the Queen with the Spaniard. The Queen thanked him; but meant not to use his helpe for that which shee did not desire, and especially not now, when he had newly molested the King of France her Allye, and had taken Amyens the strongest Town of Picardie: Though why should the Queen be so tender of the French King, when now to get an aid of four thousand Souldiers from her, he fell to Devises; intimating unto her, that he was now offered by the Popes Nuntio a very commodious peace, if he would but forsake her. But while these things were in Treaty, Amyens was recovered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine by the valour of <hi>Baskervile</hi> (who dyed at the seige) and of Sir <hi>Arthur Savage,</hi> as the King in His Letters to the Queene thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledged.</p>
            <p>About this time a Parliament was holden at Westminster, where Subsidies were willingly granted; and to this Parliament was called the Lord <hi>La Ware</hi> and restored to his blood, which by Act of Parliament in the Raigne of King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth was tainted; Also to this Parliament was called <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord HOVVARD, by the Title of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron <hi>Howard</hi> of Walden.</p>
            <p>In Ireland at this time, a great part of Ulster, and almost all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacht was in Rebellion; Whereupon <hi>Russell</hi> the Deputy was called home, and <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Burrough</hi> sent in his place, a man very stout and couragious, but no souldier: This infinitely discontented <hi>Norris,</hi> who thought himselfe sure of the place himselfe, and now to see his Rivall preferred before him, and himselfe to be under him, Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of Munster, drave him into such a melancholly, that in a very short time, (and as he thought to himselfe with much disgrace) he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his life.</p>
            <p>And now the Farle of <hi>Tir-Oen</hi> craveth, and obtaineth a moneths Truce of the new Deputy, at the moneths end, the Deputy marcheth against the Rebels, and gaineth the Fort at Blackwater, when sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Rebells sl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>As soon as the people had fortified the Castle at Blackwater and withdrawne his Army, the Rebels began to besiege it againe; (for this was the main place of their strength) which caused the Deputy with all possible speed to make thither, but unhappily dyed by the way. Whereupon the Rebells set upon the Fort more fiercely then before; but being still reppelled; they comforted themselves with this, that there was not many dayes provision left in the Fort; yet the admirable fortitude of <hi>Thomas Williams</hi> the Captain, and the Garrison Souldiers saved the place, who, when their horse-flesh was all spent, fedde upon weeds growing within the Trenches, and endured all kinde of mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And now the Lord <hi>Burrough</hi> the Deputy being dead, the Army by direction from England, was committed to the Earle of Ormond, and the Government to two Lords Justices, <hi>Adam Lofthouse</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of Dublin and Chancellour, and <hi>Robert Gardyner</hi>: To this new Lieutenant, <hi>Tir-Oen</hi> exhibiteth a Bill of his oppressions and greivances

with request of pardon, and at the same time stirreth up <hi>Mac-Hugh</hi> to a new Rebellion in Leinster.</p>
            <p>In France at this time, the French King being importuned by the Pope, and by his own Subjects, began to incline to a Peace with Spain, which the Queen understanding, she sent into France, Sir <hi>Robert Cecill, Herbert</hi> and <hi>W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And now the Queen providing for her own and her peoples safety, sent Sir <hi>Francis Vere</hi> to the States, to know if they were willing to joyn in a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Peace with the Spaniard; if not, what they would afford toward a Warre; and to deal earnestly with them, about repayment of money due to her from them. At home in the mean time, a great Consultation was holden, whither a Peace with Spain were convenient for England, or no; and many Reasons were on both sides alleaged. <hi>Burleigh</hi> Lord Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer was for Peace, Essex for Warre, and so vehement in it, that the Treasurer, after a long debating, in a strange manner of Presage, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched forth the Book of the <hi>Psalms</hi> to him, pointing him to that Verse, <hi>The bloody minded man shall not live out half his dayes.</hi> Which made Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sex afterward to set forth an Apology, with Reasons for justification of his opinion.</p>
            <p>But now another Consultation was held, about a fit man to be Deputy of Ireland; The Queen intended to send Sir <hi>William Knolles,</hi> Essex his Uncle; but Essex was violent for Sir <hi>George Carew,</hi> whom hee had a minde to remove from the Court; and when hee could not by any means perswade the Queen to it, hee then, forgetting himself and his duty, uncivilly and contemptuously turned his back upon the Queen, mutter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>g certain words. Whereupon shee growing impatient, gave him a box on the ear, and bid him be gone with a vengeance; Essex laid his hand upon his sword hilt, and swore a great oath, That he could not, nor would not put up such an Indignity; and that hee would not have taken it at King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth his hands; and so in a rage flun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>About this time, <hi>William Cecill</hi> Lord <hi>Burleigh,</hi> and high Treasurer of Eng<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The King of Denmarks Subjects having lately seized upon some goods of the English as Prize, to the value of a hundred thousand Dollers; the Queen sent the Lord <hi>Zouch,</hi> and <hi>Christopher Perkins</hi> Doctor of Law, in Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassage to the Dane, both to congratulate his late marriage with the Electors daughter of Brandenburg; and also to crave restitution of the English goods; who obtained, that in lieu thereof, Threescore thousand Dollers were repaid.

            <p>About this time, one <hi>Edward Squire</hi> was Arraigned of high Treason, he had been at first an ordinary Scrivener, afterward a Groome in the Queen; stable, and going as a Souldier in <hi>Drakes</hi> last expedition, was taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner and carryed into Spaine, there he came acquainted with one <hi>Wallpoole</hi> an English Jesuite, who caused him to be put into the Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for an Heretick, and the fellow tasting of misery, was easily drawn to become a Papist, and afterward to attempt anything for the Catholique cause. His ghostly father perswaded him it were meritorious to make away the Queen and the Earl of Essex, and sent him into England with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain poyson, wherewith to anoint the pommell of the Queens Saddle, and the chayre in which the Earl should sit, which he accordingly performed, but neither of them tooke effect, whereupon <hi>Wallpoole</hi> suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting <hi>Squires</hi> fidelity was bent to revenge it, and sent one into England, who in generall termes should lay this aspersion upon him; whereupon <hi>Squire</hi> is called in question, and never thinking that his Confessor would detect him, directly denyed all at first; but after seeing himself betrayed, confessed all the matter and was executed.</p>

and had better Right to the Crown, then any other of the Competitors. In Conclusion, he is appointed Vice-Roy; with ample Authority, to make Warre or conclude Peace, and pardon all offenders, even <hi>Tir-Oen</hi> himselfe. An army is allotted him as great as he desired: Indeed greater then ever Ireland had seen before; Twenty Thousand Foot, and Thirteen Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Horse: with these, and a great Retinue besides of the Nobility, he passeth into Ireland; where as soon as he had taken the Sword, contrary to his Commission (which was to go immediately against the arch-Rebell) he marcheth towards Munster, against the petty Rebels, taketh the Castle of Cahir, and driveth the Rebels into the Woods and Groves adjoyning. His Forces being now impaired, he tarrieth to make them up; but in the mean time sendeth directions to Sir <hi>Coniers Clifford,</hi> President of Connacht, to set upon the Rebels in one place, (thereby to sever their forces) while he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted them in another; <hi>Clifford</hi> marcheth toward Belike, with 1500. Souldiers, where the Rebels are upon them at unawares, under the conduct of <hi>O-Rorke,</hi> (his Sonne that was hanged here in England) The English re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell them at first with ease, and march along, but the Rebels finding they wanted Powder, set upon them againe, and put them to flight; in which Skirmish, <hi>Clifford</hi> and many of the old Souldiers were slain.</p>
            <p>Essex having by this time received new supplies out of England, and a check for neglecting the Queens Command, setteth forth at length toward the Borders of Ulster, with Thirteen hundred Foot, and five hundred horse, being come thither, <hi>Tir-Oen</hi> by a Messenger requesteth Parley, Essex refuseth saying, he might speake with him the next morning, between the two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes; the next day, word is brought to Essex, that <hi>Tir-Oen</hi> craved the Queens mercy, and that he might onely be heard speake, appointing the shallow of <hi>Balla Clinch</hi> for a most convenient place; thither came Essex alone, with whom <hi>Tir-Oen</hi> (riding his horse up to the girts) had private conference a full houre; A while after, <hi>Con Tir-Oens</hi> base Sonne came to Essex, requesting in his Fathers name a second Parley, and that some of the chiefe on both sides might be present: Essex consented, so there came not more then six. At the day appointed, many words had not passed, but it was argued, that their Delegates should Treat the next day concerning a Peace: between them it was concluded, that a Truce should be held from six weekes to six weeks, till May<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>By this time, the Qu. understanding that no more was done, after so much time and money spent, in a great anger taxeth the Earls proceedings, and I know not how, it fell from her to some others that stood by, that he had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoughts in his mind, then the good of his Prince and Country: And thereupon dispatched very sharp Letters to him, blaming his delay, and letting slip every faire opportunity: with which Letters Essex was so net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and chiefely troubled, that the Queen had now made <hi>Cecill</hi> Master of the Wards, which he expected himselfe: that he beganne to cast strange Projects within his minde, and held private consultations of returning into England with part of his Forces, to surprize his Adversaries; But from this course, the Earl of Southampton, and Sir Christopher Blunt disswaded him, as being dangerous and wicked. Yet within a moneth, over he went, and came to the Court at Nonesuch; to informe the Queen of the State of Ireland. By the way, the Lord Gray of Welton crossed him, but salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him not; whom one of his followers offered to kill for his contempt: but Essex would not suffer him: And made such hast, that early in the Morning he was upon his Knees, before the Queen in the Privy Chamber. She enteriained him courteously, but not with the countenance She was wont: and after a little talke, bid him keepe in his Chamber; And soon after, Committed him to Custody, in the Lord Privy Seales House; where entring into Consideration of his case, he giveth himselfe

            <p>It was now the yeer one thousand six hundred, and the two and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Kaign, when after the departure of the Earle of <hi>Essex, Tir-Oen</hi> began to carry himselfe as Monarch of Ireland, and sendeth <hi>Kernes</hi> to make spoyle in the possessions of such as continued in their loyalty to the Queene, under <hi>Mac-Guir</hi> their Captaine, who lighting casually upon Sir <hi>Warham</hi> Saint <hi>Leger,</hi> thrust him thorough with a speer, and was himself thrust thorough withall. Whereupon the Queen sent Sir <hi>Charls Blunt</hi> Lord Montjoy, to take upon him the Deputies place, who looseth no time, but first of all marcheth towards Ulster buildeth a fort, within eight miles of Armagh, which, in hononr of Sir <hi>Iohn Norris,</hi> under whom he had his first military schooling, he calleth by the name of <hi>Mount N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

All this and more he did in his first yeer, and no lesse successefull was <hi>Carew</hi> President of Munster, who drave out of the County the Titular Earle of Desmond, and having found Munster a turbulent Province in Aprill, he overcomed and made it so quiet by December following, that the Rebels maintained not one Fort in it against the Queen.</p>
            <p>And now a new consultation was holden in England, touching a peace with the King of Spaine, the which he sought both by the French King, and by <hi>Alb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Queen consenting to a Treaty, left it to the French King to nominate both the time and place for the meeting of the Delegates, who set down the Month of May, and Bulloigne in France; But now foreseeing that a question would arise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Precedency, some were appointed to search Ancient Records concerning that point. These men found in the Book of the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Court of Rome, which (according to the Canons) giveth Rule to the rest, as the Lady and Mistresse; that amongst Kings, the first place is due to the King of France, the second to the King of England and the 3. to the King of Castile; That the English quietly held this priviledge in the Generall Counsells of <hi>Basill Constance,</hi> and others, besides the Kingdome of Castile, which is the Spaniards first Title, is but an upstart in regard of England, which had Earles, but no Kings till the yeere one 1017. In like manner, that Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> the third, gave sentence for <hi>Henry</hi> the seaventh of England, against <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> who was then King of Castile.</p>
            <p>At the day appointed, the Delegates met at Bulloign, Sir <hi>Henry Nevyll, Legier</hi> Embassadour, Sir <hi>Iohn Herbert, Robert Beale,</hi> and <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Edmunds</hi> for the English, and other fot the King of Spaine and the Archduke. The English had Instructions, first concerning Preceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, in no case to give way to the King of SPAINE; yet if they contended, to put the matter to the devision of Lots, rather then the Treaty should be dissolved; and for the rest, to propose and mention the renewing of the ancient Burgundian League, freedome of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>At the meeting, when the had severally shewed their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>missions; the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish challenge the Precedency, the Spaniards do the like, and in soe peremptory a manner, that without it they would dissolve the Treaty:
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:52616:286"/>
hereupon the English made a proposition, to let passe the question of Precedency; and to transact the businesse by wrighting, and Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers between them: Or that the Treaty might be intermitted onely for threescore dayes, not quite brooken off; but all was to no purpose; And at three monthes end, they par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>The States the meane while, were so farr from regarding a Peace, that at this time, they thought upon reducing the Sea Coast of Flanders into their command<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> and thereupon they landed an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my there, of Fourteen thousand Foote, and three thousand horse under the conduct of Maurice of Nasaw; and Fifteen hundered of the English under the command of Sir <hi>Francis Vere,</hi> and his Brother <hi>Horatio</hi>: At which true happened the famous Bataile of Newport, against the Arch-duke, wherein nine thousand of the Spaniards were slaine; and the Victory by the valour of the English, fell to the Dutch, for so forward were the English in this Battaile, that of their fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred, eight hundred were slaine and sore wounded, eight Captaines killed, and of the rest every man hurt.</p>
            <p>All this year, and the year past, sundry quarells and complaints arose betweene the English and the French, touching reprisalls of goods taken from each other by Pirates of either Nation: Also touching Customes and Impositions, contrary to the Treaty of Bloys, and deceit in English Clothes, to the great infamy of our Nation. In Denmarke likewise arose controversies touching Commerce, and the Fishing of the English upon the coast of Island and Norway. The Queen also either time, for the in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>crease of Navigation and Commerce, Founded the Company of East-India Merchants, allowing them large Priviledges: but whether, thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>About this time also, Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the eight, perceiving the Queen to be in her declining age, sent two Breeves into England, the one to the Popish C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This year by reason of intemporate weather, happened a great scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Corne in England, and thereby many grievous complaints was occasioned. The common people cast out reprochfull slaunders, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Lord Treasurer <hi>Buckhurst,</hi> as the granter of Lycences for transportation of Corne; but he appealing to the Queene, shee forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with defended his Innocency, and made it knowne by open Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, imputed the fault, upon the Broggers of Corne, and Forestal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of Markets, and gave order that the slanderers should be reprehended and punished.</p>

               </gap> but onely that, which should bee for his amendment. Neverthelesse, when as the common people extolled his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, she could not, for the removall of suspition of injustice, free her self

and her counsellors, but bring him to a tryall, not in the Star-Chamber, lest the Censure should fall too heavy on him; but in the house of the Lord Privie Seal, where the cause should have a plain hearing before the Lords of the Councell, four Earls, two Barons, and four Judges of the Realm. The objections were, That contrary to his Commission, he had made the Earl of <hi>Southampton,</hi> Generall of the Horse, had drawn his Forces into <hi>Munster,</hi> neglecting the Arch-Rebell <hi>Tir-Oen,</hi> entertained a Parlee with him, against the Dignity of the Queens Majesty, and the person of a Vice-Roy, which he represented; and that the sayd Parlee was suspitious, in regard it was private. Some aggravations the Lawyers added from ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt sentences, in his Letter to the Lord Privie Seal, written two years since, as these; <hi>No storme is more fierce than the indignation of an Impotent Prince. What? Cannot Princes erre? May they not injure their Subjects,</hi> and such like.</p>
            <p>He falling upon his knee at the end of the Boord, professed he would not contest with the Queen, nor excuse the faults of his young years, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in whole, or in part, Protesting that he alwayes meant well, howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it fell out otherwise, and that now he would bid the World farewell, withall, shedding many tears, so as the standers by wept also. Yet could he not contain himself, but began to plead excuses, till the Lord Privy Seal interrupted him, advising him to proceed as he had begun, to flie to the Queens Mercy, who would not have him questioned for disloyalty, but only for a contempt; and that he did not well to pretend obedience in words, which in deeds he had not performed. At length, in the name of the rest, he pronounceth this Sentence against him; That he should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed from the office of a Privy Councellor, suspended from the functions of the Earl Marshall, and Master of the Ordnance, and be Imprisoned du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Queens pleasure. She had given expresse charge, not to suspend him from the office of Master of the Horse (minding to take him shortly into favor) and that his Censure in no case should be Recorded.

               </gap>er this, he made shew of wonderfull humility and mortification, which so affected the Queen, that shortly she removed <hi>Barkeley</hi> his keeper, and gave him leave to go at large; only admonishing him, To make his own dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion his keeper, and not to come at the Court, or in her Presence.</p>
            <p>After this Sentence, <hi>Cuffe,</hi> who alwayes perswaded the Earle to stand stoutly in his own defence, began so plainly to tax him of cowardize and pusillanimity; that the Earl in anger, commanded his name to be put out of the Rowl of his servants, yet <hi>Merrick</hi> the Steward did it not, as being of <hi>Cuffes</hi> minde himself.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Essex,</hi> being now ready to go into the Countrey, remembred himself to the Queen, by the Lord <hi>Henry Howard,</hi> in these words; <hi>That he kissed the Rod, and the Queens hands, which had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>And now the Earl grew so confident of thee Queens favor, That he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a suitor to her for the Farme of sweet Wines; but she to try his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and with what minde he would bear a repulse, made him Answer; That she must first know what it was worth, and not give away things hand over head; and had oftentimes in her mouth, the Aphorisme of Phisitians, That foul bodies, the more you nourish them, the more you corrupt them.

no touching; and no more did his, but as though every denyall of a curtesie, were an injury that required revenge; his melancholy was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently turned into choller, and now began to hearken to <hi>Cuffe</hi> again; telling him, That it was now plain, the Queen determined to make him as poore as <hi>Iob,</hi> that he should live of the basket, and gather crums under the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Hereupon he returned to <hi>London, Southampton</hi> is sent for out of the Low-Countries, his doors are set open for all commers, <hi>Merricke</hi> his Steward receiveth to his own table decayed souldiers, discontented and audacious persons; Sermons are made there every day by Puritan Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, to which the Citizens flock, and all signes of popularity appeared; which matters coming to the Queens ears, Alienated her affection from him daily more and more; but especially she was exasperated, that her Person was despised by him; for (not to say the worst) he had muttered, That the Queen was now old and decrepit, and withered as well in minde as body.</p>
            <p>And now again, he runneth upon desperate counsells, for the removall of his adversaries from the Court, seeketh to scrue himself into the King of Scots favour, to whom he traduceth his adversaries, by name <hi>Raleigh, Cobham, Carew, Cecill,</hi> and the Admirall, as inclined to the Spanish Faction, and at one and the same time, seeketh to win to him both Puritans and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists. Many were of his party, but few of his counsell; and these were the Earl of <hi>Southampton,</hi> Sir <hi>Charls Davers,</hi> Sir <hi>Ferdinando Gorge,</hi> Captain of the Garrison of <hi>Plimmouth,</hi> Sir <hi>Christopher Blunt,</hi> and some other. With these he met privately in <hi>Drury</hi> House to avoyd suspition, where he first gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth them a Catalogue of the Nobility and gentry that favoured him, to the number of a hundred and twenty. Then they consult, whether it were better to set upon the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> or the Queens Pallace; this latter they resolve upon, which should be done in this manner. <hi>Blunt</hi> should keep the great Gate, with a selected number of men, and <hi>Danvers</hi> seize upon the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence Chamber: Then <hi>Essex</hi> with his company should come from the <hi>Mues,</hi> and present himselfe before the Queen. But now suspitions arising from divers circumstances, Secretary <hi>Herbert</hi> was sent to call him before the Councell, at the Treasurers House; but he doubting the matter, excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth himselfe, that he was not very well. And now the Plot of seizing upon the Court, which had been four moneths in contriving, was by this means quite dashed, for they had ready at the present, neither Souldiers, nor muition, so as some speedier course must now be thought on; at which time very opportunely cometh one to them (set on no doubt by <hi>Essex</hi> his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries) as if he had been sent on purpose from the Citizens, to promise him their Ayd, which made <hi>Essex</hi> to applaud his own great good fortune.</p>
            <p>And now were four of the Lords, namely the Lord Keeper, the Earle of <hi>Worcester,</hi> Sir <hi>William Knolles,</hi> and the Lord Chiefe Justice of <hi>England,</hi> sent by the Queen to <hi>Essex</hi> house, who could hardly be suffered to come, in, all their Attendants were kept out, save he that carried the Seal before the Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. In the Court, they found a confused number of people, and the Earls of <hi>Essex, Rutland,</hi> and <hi>Southampton</hi> in the midst of them. The Keeper tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning himselfe to <hi>Essex,</hi> telleth him, The Queen had sent him and the rest to understand the cause of this concourse, promising Justice, if any person had done them wrong. <hi>Essex</hi> with a loud voice cryeth out, They lye in waite for my life, we are met to defend our selves. The Keeper urging <hi>Essex</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to unfold some part of his grievance; the unruly multitude crieth out, Away, let us be gone, they come to betray you, Kill them, cast away that Great Seal. <hi>Essex</hi> retireth into the house, the Lords follow him, he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth them to make the doors fast, and turning him to the Lords, Have pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience for a while (saith he) I must go into the City, to dispatch a little busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse with the Maior and Sheriffs, I will return presently.</p>

Passing along the City, he came all in a sweat to the Sheriff <hi>Smith</hi>'s house, who shifteth himself forth at a back door, and goeth to the Lord Maior. By this time, certain of the Nobility entred the City with a Herald, declaring <hi>Essex</hi> and his adherents Traytors. Hereupon, hearing also that the Lord Admirall made towards him with an Army, he began to be dishear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Earl content, that <hi>Popham</hi> only should be freed; but he refused, unlesse the Keeper also might be dismissed. Then <hi>Gorge</hi> freeth them all, and goeth along with them to the Court by water.</p>
            <p>Now when <hi>Essex</hi> thought to return, he found a Chain fastened crosse the street, at the West end of <hi>Pauls,</hi> and men in Arms on the other side: then he began to draw his sword; and having once given the word, <hi>Blunt</hi> letteth fly at them, slew one of them incontinent, himself being sorely wounded and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. <hi>Essex</hi> himself had his Hat shot thorow; whereupon retiring, he took Boat at <hi>Queen Hythe,</hi> and went to <hi>Essex</hi> House; where finding the Counsellors all dismissed, he grew extreme angry and dismayed, and cast certain papers into the fire, saying, They should tell no tales. By and by the Admirall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siegeth the house, commanding them to yeeld. <hi>Southampton</hi> offereth, if the Admirall would give Hostages to secure them, they would present them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the Queen.

But <hi>Essex</hi> his minde, upon a little deliberation alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they fell upon their knees, and deliver their weapons to the Admirall, when it was ten a clock at night. <hi>Owen Salisbury,</hi> and one or two more were slain with Musket Shot, and as many of the Besiegers. The next day, <hi>Thomas Lea,</hi> Commander of a Company of Souldiers in <hi>Ireland,</hi> who to one <hi>Crosse</hi> a Sea-Captain (that detected him) intimated, how noble an exploit it were, for six stout fellows to go to the Queen, and compell her forceably to release <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sex</hi> and <hi>Southampton,</hi> was presently apprehended, examined, found guilty and executed. <hi>Essex</hi> and <hi>Southampton</hi> were carryed first to <hi>Lambeth,</hi> to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops house, because it was a dark night; but anon were sent to the Tower, by the Queens direction; and with them, <hi>Rutland, Sands, Cromwell, Mounteagle, Danverse,</hi> and <hi>Bromley,</hi> the rest were put in common prisons.</p>
            <p>On the nineteenth of <hi>February, Essex</hi> and <hi>Southampton</hi> were called to their Arraignment, before their Peers in <hi>Westminster</hi>-Hall, where <hi>Buckhurst</hi> Lord Treasurer, was appointed Lord High Steward of <hi>England</hi> for that time. The Peers being severally called by their names, <hi>Essex</hi> demanded, If it were not lawfull for them to except against some of the Pee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Judges made answer, That the credit and fidelity of the Peers of <hi>England</hi> was presumed to be such, that in Tryalls they were not bound to take an Oath, nor are they lyable to any excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Then were they joyntly indited of High Treason; namely, That they plotted to deprive the Queen of her life and Kingdom, To surprize her in her very Palace; And that they brake forth into open Rebellion, by imprisoning the Counsellors of the Kingdom, By exciting the <hi>Londoners</hi> to Re-bellion with vaine Fictions; By assaulting the Queens loyall Subjects in the City, and by defending of <hi>Essex</hi> House against the Queens Forces. Hereunto they pleaded, Not guilty.

               <hi>Essex</hi> withall averring, That they had done nothing but of necessity, and the Law of Nature. <hi>Yelverton</hi> aggravateth the specialties; and <hi>Edward Cook</hi> Atturney, argueth, That the Earl could not excuse himself from the Law of Nature, seeing Majesty is not to be affronted for private revenge. The Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> with great confidence made answer, That to his Prince and Countrey, he alwayes had and would bear a loyall affection. The <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> (one that was little expected to speak against <hi>Essex,</hi> by whom he had been raised) in defence of <hi>Cobham, Cecill,</hi> and <hi>Raleigh,</hi> aggravateth his crying out, That the Crown of <hi>England</hi> was sold to the Spaniard: wherto <hi>Essex</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, that he heard indeed, that <hi>Cecill</hi> the Secretary should say to one of the Lords of the Councell, That the Right of the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>England,</hi> was as good as any of the Competitors. Upon this <hi>Cecill</hi> (who stood by as an Auditor) steppeth in, and falling upon his knees, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seecheth the Steward that with his good leave, he might quit himself from this foul aspersion: which leave being granted him, he provoked <hi>Essex,</hi> if he durst, to name the Counsellor; but he would not: therefore (saith <hi>Cecill</hi>) It is a Faction: still <hi>Essex</hi> averreth it. Then <hi>Cecill</hi> turning himself to <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton,</hi> besought him, by all manner of Obtestations, to name the man. He referreth it to the Honorable Assembly, and to <hi>Cecill</hi> himself, if in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and good Reason he ought to do it: they affirming, He might, <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton</hi> nameth Sir <hi>William Knolles, Essex</hi> his Unkle. He being sent for, at <hi>Cecills</hi> intreaty, said, That <hi>Cecill</hi> two yeers since told him, that one <hi>Dolman,</hi> in a Book, had asserted the Right of the <hi>Infanta,</hi> and had spoken no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than so.</p>

               </gap>, the Earls, by the Stewards direction, were taken aside: Then the Peers rose, and went apart, and having consulted about an hour, returned to their seats, and in their order, pronounced the Earls guilty of high Treason. Then the high Steward, advising <hi>Essex</hi> to implore the Queens mercy, giveth Sentence, and that done, brake his Staff and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted.</p>
            <p>The next day, Sir <hi>Robert Vernon,</hi> Sir <hi>William Constable,</hi> Sir <hi>Edmund Bayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Littleton, Cluff,</hi> Captain <hi>Whitlock, Iohn</hi> and <hi>Christopher Wright</hi> and <hi>Orell</hi> an old Souldier, were called to their Tryall: but the Queen (informed by Sir <hi>Fulk Grevill,</hi> That most of them were drawn unwittingly into the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger) commanded that onely <hi>Littleton, Baynham,</hi> and <hi>Orell</hi> should have their Tryall, the rest to be sent back to prison.

            <p>
               <hi>Essex</hi> in the mean while, requested he might speak with some of the Counsellors, to whom he reconciled himself, and to <hi>Cecill</hi> especially; and then intimated, That the Queen could not be in safety while he lived; he requesteth he might be executed privately in the Tower: He grievously in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigheth against some of the Conspiracy, and wished to speak with some of them, but specially with <hi>Blunt</hi> and <hi>Cuffe</hi>; whom as soon as he saw, he brake forth into these words; <hi>O Cuffe, ask pardon of God and the Queen, for thou hast chiefly provoked me to this disloyalty.</hi> Also he intimated Sir <hi>Henry Nevill,</hi> ordinary Ambassadour in <hi>France,</hi> to have been acquainted with the Conspiracy; and that other in <hi>Scotland, France,</hi> the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Mountjoy,</hi> Deputy of <hi>Ireland,</hi> knew of his purpose, and other in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; who being many in number, and the Lord <hi>Mountjoy</hi> ordering the Affairs of <hi>Ireland</hi> in good fashion, the Queen wisely would take no notice of it.</p>

            <p>The fifth of <hi>March,</hi> Sir <hi>Christopher Blunt,</hi> Sir <hi>Charles Davers,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Davis,</hi> Sir <hi>Gyllie Merrick,</hi> and <hi>Cuffe,</hi> were brought to their Tryall in <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster</hi>-Hall, before the Queens Delegates. The Heads of their Indite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, were the same which were objected to <hi>Essex</hi> and <hi>Southampton.</hi> The others said little in their defence, onely <hi>Cuffe</hi> stood upon these two Answers; Whereas (saith he) I am challenged of Treason, because I was in <hi>Essex</hi> house the day of the Rebellion; by the same Argument the Lion in the Celler might be indited; all that day I lamented the Earls Fortune, and dealt with him to flie to the Queens mercy. And as for the Consultation in <hi>Drury</hi> House, it is no more to be called High Treason, than an Embryon may be accounted a perfect man. The Lawyers on the other side demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated, That no necessity lay upon him to tarry in the House; and that the Consultation in <hi>Drury</hi> House was it self a Treason, though it had never broke forth into act. <hi>Merrick</hi> said onely this, The Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> raised me, and he hath overturned me.</p>
            <p>The thirteenth of <hi>March, Merrick</hi> and <hi>Cuffe</hi> are drawn to Tyburn, where <hi>Cuffe</hi> entring into a long Speech, was by the Sheriff interrupted; and then, after prayers to God, and desiring God and the Queen to pardon him, he was cast from the Ladder: a man of great Wit and Learning, but of a boysterous and turbulent disposition. In the same manner died <hi>Merrick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fifteenth of <hi>March,</hi> Sir <hi>Charles Davers,</hi> and Sir <hi>Christopher Blunt</hi> were beheaded on the Tower-Hill; albeit <hi>Davers</hi> offered ten thousand pounds to redeem his life, though with perpetuall Imprisonment. The Earl of <hi>Southampton,</hi> and the Sheriff <hi>Smith,</hi> were kept prisoners; though <hi>Smith,</hi> after some time, was upon sureties suffered to go at large. The eighth of <hi>Iuly,</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Nevill</hi> was cited before the Lords of the Counsell, where it was laid to his Charge, That he was present at the Consultation in <hi>Drury</hi> House, yet had not revealed their sinister purpo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He confessed, That at the Earls intreaty, he shewed him the Commentaries of the French proceedings, was present at one of their Consultations onely, but contemned their counsells, yet durst not be an Informer against so great Personages. Hereupon he had a grievous check given him, and was committed to prison.</p>
            <p>One Act of the By, is not here to be omitted. <hi>Essex</hi> at his Arraignment had complained, That his hand-writing was counterfeited.

               </gap> lighted by chance upon the Letter, and perceiving some passages in it which might bring the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> into danger, got a cunning fellow to draw a counterfeit Copy of the said Letter; with this he cometh to the fearfull

Lady, who was newly brought to bed, threatning to give the same to her husbands adversaries; unlesse she would presently give him three thousand pounds. She to shun the danger, paid him eleven hundred and seventy pounds at the very instant; yet did he deliver her the counterfeit Copy on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meaning to make use of the true one, to get another sum of the Earls adversaries. This imposture being found out, he was censured to perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Imprisonment, condemned in three thousand pounds (two of which were to go to the Countesse) and his ears nayled to the Pillory, with this Writing over his head; <hi>A notorious Cheater.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Soon after, a Parliament was assembled, wherein grievous complaints being tendred to the lower House touching Monopolies; the Queen, by way of prevention, sendeth out Proclamations, declaring the said Licenses and Patents to be voyd in part, leaving some part to the discussion of the Laws: which thing was so acceptable to the Lower House, that they presently sent 80 selected persons; together with the Speaker, to give the Queen thanks; and she on the other side, gave them thanks, for being such faithfull Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to her, to recall her from an errour, whereinto through ignorance, not wilfulnesse, she was fallen.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Deputy, at the entry of the Spring, draweth his Forces together and driveth <hi>Tir-Oen</hi> from where he had fortified himself; <hi>Carew,</hi> President of <hi>Munster,</hi> taketh the titular Earl lurking in a Cave, and receiveth intelligence, That the Spaniards, invited by <hi>Tir Oen,</hi> had a purpose to land in <hi>Munster,</hi> yet could not perswade the Deputy they had any designe for <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; but in the midst of <hi>September,</hi> certain news was brought, The Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards were in sight, who wanting winde to carry their Fleet to <hi>Cork,</hi> put in to <hi>Kinsale,</hi> the three and twentieth of <hi>September,</hi> and land their Souldiers without resistance. <hi>Richard Percy,</hi> having but few Souldiers to defend the Town, is commanded to come away, and leave <hi>Kinsale</hi> to the Spaniards, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which they enter with Ensignes displayed, and by the Magistrates and Inhabitants, were bidden welcome.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>D'Aquila,</hi> who commanded the Spaniards, publisheth a Declaration, wherein he sheweth, That Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was deposed from her King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by sentence of the Pope, her subjects absolved from their Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; And that the Spaniards were now come to deliver <hi>Ireland</hi> from the Jaws of the devill. <hi>Tir Oen</hi> joyneth his Forces with them, so as they were now six thousand Foot, and five hundred Horse, and promised themselves assured Victory, the English being not neer so many. The four and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth of <hi>December,</hi> a Battell is joyned; where, after a long Fight, the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry inclined to the English. <hi>Tir Oen, O donell,</hi> and the rest, cast away their Weapons, and save themselves by flight. <hi>Alphonso O Campo,</hi> chief Leader of the Spaniards, together with three other Captains, was taken prisoner, and six Ensigne-bearers, twelve hundred were slain, nine Colours taken, whereof four belonged to the Spaniards: of the English not many were slain, but a great number wounded.</p>
            <p>After six dayes, <hi>D'Aquila</hi> sendeth Letters to the Deputy by a Drummer, requesting that some person of account might be sent to him, with whom to confer; Sir <hi>William Godolphine</hi> is sent, to whom he complained of cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardise, and (he feared) treachery of the Irish; and therefore, although he wanted nothing to hold out the Siege, and did daily expect great Forces from <hi>Spain,</hi> yet was willing to make a Composition: whereupon, at last it was agreed, The Spaniards should yeeld up <hi>Kinsale</hi> to the Deputy, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the Castles and Forts at <hi>Baltimore, Bere-Haven,</hi> and <hi>Castle-haven,</hi> and should depart with life and goods, and Colours displayed.

                  </gap>n</hi> hoyseth Sayl, and <hi>Monson</hi> afterward, having in vain tarryed behinde, for some Dutch Ships to joyn with them. <hi>Levison</hi> in the mean time light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Spanish Navy of eight and thirty Ships, which brought the Treasure from <hi>America,</hi> and set upon them, but to no purpose. When <hi>Monson</hi> was come with the rest of the Fleet, they had certain notice, That a mighty Indian Caraque of sixteen hundred Tun, and richly laden, was upon the Coast of <hi>Portugall.</hi> There indeed they found it, but it lay close under a Fort, attended with eleven Gallies; and the Caraque it self appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as big as a Castle; yet they resolved to fire it, if they could not take it. The next day, they thundered so violently against the Gallies, that within seven hours the Marquesse of St. <hi>Crosse,</hi> together with <hi>Portugall</hi> Gallies which he commanded, withdrew themselves; two of them were taken and fired; and in them was great store of Powder, which was going for the <hi>Low-Countries.</hi> And now <hi>Levison</hi> signified to the Captain of the Caraque, That the Gallies which they trusted to, were driven away, and therefore, if they now refused mercy, they must expect none hereafter. After much speech to and fro, it was at last agreed, That the Caraque, with the Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and Merchandise, should be yeelded up. Thus the English, having a fair winde, returned homeward with a Booty, to the value of a Million of Duckets, by the <hi>Portugall</hi> account, and not past five of their men lost in the Voyage.</p>
            <p>At this time there arose a Contestation amongst the Popish Clergy here in <hi>England</hi>; for the Jesuites and the Secular Priests, made bitter Invectives in their writings, one against the other. The originall of the Priests quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell was, That <hi>Blackwell,</hi> one wholly at the beck of the Jusuites, was set over them as Arch-Presbyter, who first of all despoiled them of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties; and when they appealed to the Pope, caused them to be declared Schismaticks and Hereticks. They in sundry Books extolled the Queen very highly, as one that dealt mildly alwayes with the Catholikes, till such time as they set all in a combustion in <hi>England</hi>; and by their Treasons, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed most severe Laws to be enacted against the Catholikes. <hi>Parsons</hi> they traduced, as a Bastard, an Equivocator, and a Traytor. Whether they contended thus in good earnest, or in jest only, is hard to say; but the Bishop of <hi>London</hi> politickly nourished the contention; and all he gained, was this, That the Queen and her Councell, finding them dangerous to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, both the one and the other, upon Penalty of the Laws, were by Proclamation commanded to depart out of the Kingdom pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently.</p>
            <p>In <hi>France,</hi> the Marshall <hi>Biron,</hi> for entring into dangerous attempts against the publike Peace, was arraigned, and lost his head. His confession brought some other into danger; and amongst them, the Duke of <hi>Bulloign,</hi> of the Protestant Religion, that when he was cited, he durst not appear, but fled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Germany.</hi> Hereupon the King of <hi>France</hi> sendeth to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> complaining that the Duke held his Marriage unlawfull, and the Popes Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation nothing worth, pronouncing his son Illegitimate; had destined the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> to the Succession of the Crown, and conspired the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the prime of the Nobility. The Queen, by her Legier Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour, adviseth the King not too credulously to entertain those reports, as doubting these suggestions might proceed from some of the Spanish Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Hereupon the King grew very angry, saying, The Queen held a better opinion of the Duke then he deserved, and that he was one of the chief Architects of <hi>Essex</hi> his Treason; and being questioned by the King about it,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:52616:290"/>
was not able to deny it. About this time also, the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> by cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning slights, and open force, practised against the State of <hi>Geneva</hi>; and the Queen relieved them with a great sum of money, gathered amongst the Clergy and Laity all over <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now the Earl of <hi>Tyrone,</hi> perceiving himself in a desperate estate, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to sue for mercy, and promised at last to submit his life and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes to the Queens pleasure, absolutely without condition. Hereupon, being admitted to the presence of the Deputy, at the very entry of the room, he fell on his knees; and then passing on a few steps, prostrated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self again, saying, I confesse and crave pardon for my great fault, against God, and a most bountifull Prince, my dread Soveraign: I fly to the Queens mercy, as a sacred Anchor, permitting her to dispose of my life and Fortunes at her pleasure. Upon this his submission, the Deputy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to go aside, and the next day took him along to <hi>Dublin</hi> with him, meaning to bring him into <hi>England,</hi> that the Queen might deal with him according to her Royall pleasure: But before he could come into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the Queen died.</p>

In her third yeer, Proclamation was made, That the Teston, coyned for twelve pence, and in the Raign of King <hi>Edward</hi> embased to six pence, should not be currant but for four pence; the Groat, but for two pence; and the piece of two pence, but for a penny: And not long after, all the said base Moneyes were called in, and fine Sterling money was allowed for them, after the Rate.
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:52616:290"/>
For <hi>Ireland</hi> also, she coyned Sterling money; where nine pence in <hi>England,</hi> went for twelve pence there. The Queen was the first that brought cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Counties to deliver Provision at a certain rate, that so they might be freed from the Purveyors: Also the first that granted allowance to Judges for their Circuit. In her sixth yeer, in a Parliament then holden, it was made Treason to refuse taking the Oath of Supremacy; yet with this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation, That by it the blood should not be dishonoured, nor goods con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiscate; nor the Oath to be required of any Baron of the Kingdom. Also this yeer, by a Common Councell in <hi>London,</hi> It was enacted, That all such Citizens as from thenceforth should be constrained to sell their hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold-stuff, Leases of houses, or such like, should first cause the same to be cried thorow the City, by a man with a Bell, and then to be sold by the common Outcryer appointed for that purpose, and he to receive one far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing upon the shilling for his pains. In her three and twentieth yeer, she represseth by Proclamation excesse in apparell, Gold Chayns, and Clokes which men wore down to their heels. The length of Swords was limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to three Foot, and Daggers to twelve Inches, besides the Hilts. Buildings likewise in the Suburbs were restrained, In-mates forbidden, and expresse charge set forth, That no dwelling house should be new built within three miles of any of the City Gates, under pain of imprisonment, and losse of the materialls. In her time was set on foot by Sir <hi>Thomas Smith,</hi> the Law made for the serving of Colledges with provision, to the great benefit of those Scholasticall Societies. In her two and fortieth yeer, she setteth forth Proclamations against the Transportation of Gold or Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, wrought or unwrought, according to the former Acts of Parliament in that case provided. This yeer also she founded the Company of the East India Merchants, and allowed them ample Priviledges. In her three and fourtieth yeer, all Monopolies are called in by Proclamation. In her four and twentieth yeer, severe Laws are made against Papists, some inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing death, some fine and imprisonment.

Also in a Parliament holden in her first yeer, the first Fruits and Tenths were restored to the Crown, and the Supreme Government over the State Ecclesiasticall, and the book of Common-Prayer, and Administration of the Sacraments in the English Tongue was restored, and by degrees the Protestant Religion was esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished. The Bishops that refused the Oath of Supremacy, were all remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and Protestant Bishops placed in their room. It was enacted also, That all persons should go to Divine Service upon Sundayes and Holy-dayes, and a Fine of twelve pence imposed upon every one that should be absent, and the same to be given to the poor. In her fourth yeer, the Queen was solicited by Pope <hi>Pius,</hi> to send her Orators to the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> which she refused, as not acknowledging it a lawfull Councell. In a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment holden in her eighth yeer, it was enacted, and by a generall consent declared, That the Election of the Arch-bishops and Bishops in <hi>England,</hi> together with their Consecration, Confirmation, and Investiture (which some persons slanderously called in question) was lawfull and Canonicall, and that they were rightly, and according to the Acts and Statutes of the

In her eleventh yeer, there arose in <hi>England</hi> two contrary factions in Religion: on the one side, <hi>Thomas Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, Nicholas Sanders,</hi> and other Divines that had fled out of <hi>England,</hi> began to exercise the Episcopall Jurisdiction upon the Queens Subjects, which they had derived from the Sea of <hi>Rome:</hi> On the other side, <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Burton, Hallingham, Benson,</hi> and other, making profession of the pure Religion, would allow of nothing but what was directly taken out of the Scriptures, openly condemning the received Discipline of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> together with the Church Liturgy, and the very Calling of Bishops, as savouri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Whereupon, the Queen, to suppresse them, whom by no means she liked, commanded every where the severity of the Law touching the Uniformity of Common-Prayer, to be put in execution, and those books, upon pain of Imprisonment, to be delivered into the hands of the Bishops, or some of the Queens Councell.

Many of their books were printed, under these titles, <hi>The Gospel of the Kingdom, The Lords Sentences, The Prophesie of the spirit of love,

In a Parliament holden the eight and twentieth yeer of her Raign, some, out of a desire of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, began to pick quarrells at the Clergy, desiring to passe Laws for the restraint of Bishops in their granting of Faculties, conferring of holy Orders, Eccles<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>reupon, he provided three Articles, to which every Minister should subscribe:
<list>
                     <item>The first, <hi>That the Queen had Supreme Authority over all persons born within her Dominions, of what condition soever they were; and that no other Prince, or Prelate, or Potentate, hath, or ought to have any Iurisdiction, Civill or Ecclesiasticall, within her Realms and Dominions.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>The second, <hi>That the Book of Common-Prayer, and of the Ordination of Bishops, Priests and Deacons, containeth nothing contrary to the Word of God, but may lawfully be used; and that they will use that, and none other.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>The third, <hi>That the Articles agreed on in the Synod holden at London, in the yeer</hi> 1562, <hi>and published by the Queens Authority, they did allow of, and believe them to be consonant to the Word of God.</hi>

               <p>It is incredible, what reproaches the Arch-bishop incurred by setting forth these Articles, both from factious Ministers, and from some also of the Nobility; yet by his patience and constancy, he brought at last Peace to the Church, making this his Motto, <hi>Vincit qui patitur.</hi> Neither did these at home onely disturb the Peace of the Church, but others also from abroad, as <hi>Robert Brown,</hi> a young Student of Divinity in <hi>Cambridge</hi>; from whom came the Sectaries called Brownists; and <hi>Richard Harrison,</hi> a petty School-Master. These presuming to judge matters of Religion by their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate spirit, by books set forth in <hi>Zealand,</hi> and dispersed at this time over <hi>England,</hi> condemned the Church of <hi>England</hi> for no Church, and ensnared many in the nets of their new Schism.

In the place from whence it was first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, it left a gaping distance forty foot broad, and fourscore Ells long; the whole Field was about twenty Acres. Passing along, it overthrew a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell standing in the way, removed an Ewe-Tree planted in the Church-yard, from the West into the East: with the like force it thrust before it High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, Sheep-folds, Hedges and Trees, made tilled ground Pasture, and again turned Pasture into Tillage. Having walked in this sort from <hi>Saturday</hi> in the evening, till <hi>Munday</hi> noon, it then stood still.

Sir <hi>Thomas Smith,</hi> born at <hi>Saffron Walden</hi> in <hi>Essex,</hi> sometime Secretary to K. <hi>Edward</hi> the 6, who wrote an imperfect Work of the English Common-wealth, a singular Book of the Orthography of the English Tongue, and another of the Pronunciation of the Greek; the first man that set on foot the Law for serving the Colledges with Provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Sir <hi>Henry Savill,</hi> Provost of <hi>Eaton,</hi> and Reader to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who set forth all S. <hi>Chrysostomes</hi> works in Greek, and by translating of <hi>Cornelius Tacitus,</hi>, deserved as much of the English Tongue, as he of the Latin: But above all, the admirable sir <hi>Philip Sidney,</hi> who by writing in a light Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, shewed how excellently, and beyond all comparison he could have done in a grave. Learned Divines were <hi>Iohn Iewell,</hi> born in <hi>Devon</hi>-shire, a Student in <hi>Corpus Christi</hi> Colledge in <hi>Oxford,</hi> in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time an Exile, by Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> made Bishop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> who wrote an Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie for the Protestant Doctrine, and died at scarce fifty yeers of age, in the fourteenth yeer of Queen <hi>Elizabeth.

            <p>The King had by this time found the love and affection of his own people; but the affection of neighbouring Princes towards him stood yet in suspence, when now to take away that doubt came first in the beginning of <hi>Iune,</hi> an Embassador from the <hi>Palsgrave</hi> of <hi>Rhyne</hi>; presently after another from the States of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zeland</hi>; another from the Arch-Duke of <hi>Austria</hi>; another from the King of <hi>Spaine</hi>; from the <hi>Seignory</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> another; another from the Duke of <hi>Florence</hi>; and lastly on the eight of <hi>Iune,</hi> Mon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Vpon the seventeenth of <hi>May</hi> this yeere, were made fourteene Serjeants at Law: whereof eleven had received Writs the last yeare of Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi>: namely, <hi>Thomas Coventry, Robert Haughton, Lawrence Tanfield, Iohn Crooke, Thomas Foster, Edward Philips, Thomas Harris, Iames Altham; Henry Hub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard; Augustine Nicholls</hi>; and <hi>Robert Perker</hi>; to whom the King added three new; <hi>Iohn Sherley; George Snygge</hi>; and <hi>Richard Hutton,</hi> who all kept their Feast together in the Middle Temple Hall</p>
            <p>One would thinke that by this time, all Offences against Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had been forgotten: but King <hi>Iames</hi> more tender of wrongs done to her than to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, would not suffer <hi>Valentine Thomas</hi> so to escape; who after he had lyen many yeeres prisoner in the Tower, was on the fourth of <hi>

            <p>All this while the King had moved within his own Spheare, and had done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing out of the Realme; his first Imployment abroad was now in <hi>Iune,</hi> to his brother the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> to whom he sent in Embassage the Earle of <hi>Rut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> upon two occasions: the one to be Godfather to his sonne, who was named <hi>Christianus,</hi> the other to present him with the Order of the Gar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It was now a time that every man might sit under his Vine: and enjoy the happinesse of a peaceable Government: when suddenly like a storme in a faire Somers day, brake forth a Treason of a strange Composition: for where in all Treaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s commonly they are all of some one Faction in this, there were people of all sorts; Priests and Laymen, Papists and Protestants, Noblement, Knights and Gen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Indeed the great favour which King <hi>Iames</hi> at his first comming to the Crown, shewed to the Earle of <hi>South-Hampton,</hi> was like to breed no good blood in those that were his oposites; and it was said (how true I know not) that as the King had sent to enlarge the Earle of <hi>South-Hampton,</hi> and apointed him to meet him upon the way: So when he heard of an Intention that the Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> and Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> had to meet him; he sent them word they should spare their labour.

            <p>Concerning the first Point, it was proved, that the Lord <hi>Grey</hi> intended to obtaine the levying of two thousand men, for defence of the <hi>Low-Countreyes,</hi> and with them to seize u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For the other Points, It was proved, that the Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> and Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi> met at S, <hi>Martins</hi> in the Fields; and there consulted about raising Sedition, mooving Rebellion, altering Religion, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the State, and to set up the Lady <hi>Arbella.</hi> And particularly for the Point of subverting the State: It was proved, that <hi>Watson</hi> was designed to be Lord Chancellor, <hi>George Brooke</hi> Lord Treasurer, Sir <hi>Griffin Markham</hi> Secretary, and the Lord <hi>Grey</hi> to be Master of the Horse, and Earle Marshall of <hi>England,</hi> and for effecting of these Treasons, It was proved that <hi>Waston</hi> the Priest had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised Oaths in writing, by which all parties were bound to keep them secret. And for the last point, It was proved, that Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> was appointed to treate with Count <hi>Aramberg</hi> for six hundred thousand C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>About this time a strange fancy possessed the braines of a professed Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, one <hi>Richard Haidock</hi> of new Colledge in <hi>Oxford,</hi> who pretended to preach at night in his sleep, in such sort, that though he were called aloud or stirred and pull'd by the hands or feet, yet would make no shew of either hearing or feeling: And this he did often, in the presence of many honorable persons, that came to heare him; so as within a short time, his fame was spread thorough the land, by the name of the sleeping Preacher. At length the King commanded him to be brought to the Court, where his Majesty sate up the most part of a night to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the event: when at last, <hi>Haidock</hi> making a shew to bee a sleepe, began to Pray; then taking a Text, made his Division; applying it to his purpose, for in his Preaching his use was to Inveight against the Pope, against the Crosse in Baptism and against the last Canons of the Church of <hi>England</hi>; and having ended his Sermon seemed to continue sleeping. His Majesty having well observed the manner of his cariage; after a few days, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the said <hi>Haidock</hi> before him, and in Conference with him (as he had indeed an admirable sagacity in discovering of Fictions) made him confesse, that all he did was but imposture: and thereupon to fall upon his knees, and aske forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, which the King granted, upon condition, that in all places he should o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly acknowledge his offence; because many were brought into beliefe, that his nightly preaching was either by inspiration or by vision.</p>
            <p>We may not here think it unworthy the relating, seeing King <hi>Iames</hi> thought it not unworthy the seeing, thereby to observe the nature of the <hi>Lyon,</hi> and made a solemne matter of it: for on <hi>Munday</hi> the 3 of <hi>Iune</hi> (taking with him the Duke of <hi>Lenox,</hi> and diverse Earles and Lords) he went to the Lyons Tower and caused two Lyons a male and a female, to bee put forth, and then a live Cock to bee cast before them<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then a live Lambe to bee put downe to them, which the generous Lyons (as having respect to its Innocency) never offered to touch, though the Lamb was so bold to go close unto them. Then the King caused those Lyons to be taken away and another Lyon to be put forth, and two Mastifs to be put into him, who presently flew upon the Lyon and turned him upon his back, and though the Lyon were superior to them in strength, yet it seemes they were his matches in courage and so much superior, as that they were the first assailants, with whom otherwise, perhaps the Lyon would not have offered to meddle.</p>

               </gap>n the King, Prince and all the Nobility should be sitting in the upper House, and all the Knights and Burgesses in the Lower.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:52616:299"/>The principall contriver of this Plot was <hi>Robert Catesbie,</hi> a Gentleman of great account in <hi>Northampton-shire,</hi> descended from that <hi>Catesby</hi> who had been a speciall Counseller of King <hi>Richard</hi> the third, to whose family the Divine Providence had now ordained to give a disastrous period. This <hi>Catesby</hi> not able to performe the worke himselfe alone, drawes in many to assist him, as namely, <hi>Thomas Percie, Thomas Winter, Iohn Grant, Ambrose Rookwood, Iohn Wright, Francis Tresham, Guido Fawkes,</hi> and at last Sir <hi>Edward Digby,</hi> all earnest Papists, and all bound by Oath, and by receiving the Sacrament to be secret; For effecting of this plot, they hired a house close adjoyning to the Upper house of Parliament, where they were to dig thorow a Wall, for the fit placing of their Powder. About <hi>Candlemasse</hi> they had wrought the Wall halfe thorow: when suddainly they heard a noyse in the next room which made them feare they had beene discovered: but sending <hi>Guy Fawkes</hi> (who went now under the name of <hi>Iohn Iohnson,</hi> as Master <hi>Percies</hi> man) to see what the matter was, he brought word, that it was a Cellar where Sea-Coles had beene layd, and were now a selling, and the roome offered to bee let for a yearely rent. This roome therefore as most fit for their purpose, being right under the Parliament House, Master <hi>Percie</hi> presently went and hired, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into it twenty barrells of powder, which they covered with Billets and Faggots, for being discovered. Thus the first part of the plot was put in a good readinesse. It now remained to consider what was to be done, when the blow should be given: for though the King and Prince might be slain, yet the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> should still be safe, and so they should bee no nearer their end than now they were. This work therefore for surprizing the D. of <hi>Yorke, Percie</hi> undertook, and for surprizing the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> they agreed upon a match of hu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus farre their bloudy plot went fairely on, and had perhaps gone on so still, if they had continued onely bloudy; but now a tendernesse of heart tooke some of them, lest their friends should perish together with the rest, and this tendernesse overthrowes them; for to prevent such promiscuous slaughter, a Letter was framed, and sent to the Lord <hi>Mounteagle,</hi> sonne and heire to the Lord <hi>Morley,</hi> brought him by one of his Foot-men, which hee received from an unknowne man in the street. The Letter was this. <hi>My Lord, out of the Love I beare to some of your friends, I have a care of your preservation; therefore I would wish you, as you tender your life, to forbeare your attendance at this Parliament; for God and man have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred to punish the wickednesse of this time: And thinke not slightly of this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisement: for though there bee no appe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But in the midst of this great joy, there was suddenly spread a rumour of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sorrow, for on <hi>Saturday</hi> the two and twentieth of <hi>March,</hi> newes was brought to the Court for certaine, that the King was slaine at <hi>Oking,</hi> twentie miles from <hi>London,</hi> stabbed with an invenomed knife; whereupon the Court gates were presently shut, and double guard set in all places about <hi>London,</hi> and all mens mindes were infinitely distracted; but within two houres all these clouds were cleane dispersed, and the Sun began to shine out againe; and it was certainly knowne, that the King was safe, and in perfect health: for which a Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation was presently set forth to signifie it to the people; and that afternoone the King came himselfe to <hi>White-hall,</hi> where thousands of people, ravished with joy, came flocking to see him; and so generall was the rejoycing, that the <hi>Spanish</hi> Embassador, gave Sir <hi>Lewis Lewk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>The eight and twentieth of <hi>March</hi> following, <hi>Henry Garvet</hi> Provinciall of the <hi>English</hi> Iesuites, was arraigned in <hi>Guild-hall,</hi> for concealing the foresaid treason, where he had Iudgement to be hang'd, drawne, and quartered, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly on the third of <hi>May,</hi> was drawne from the Tower to the west end of <hi>Pauls</hi> Church, and there executed. At his death, he confessed his fault, asked forgivenesse, and exhorted all Catholikes never to attempt any treason against the King or State; as a course which God would never prosper.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Tuesday</hi> the twentieth of <hi>May,</hi> were enstalled at <hi>Windsor</hi> Knights of the Garter, <hi>Robert Cecill,</hi> Earle of <hi>Salisburie,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Howard Viscount Byndon</hi>; both of them honourably attended, but the Earle of <hi>Salisburie</hi> beyond ordinary proportion.</p>
            <p>There was yet a Fag end of the late powder treason behind to be examined: whereupon two Barons of the Realms; namely, <hi>Henrie</hi> Lord <hi>Mordant,</hi> and <hi>Edw.</hi> Lord <hi>Sturton,</hi> were brought from the Tower, to the Star-Chamber: and there, not charged indeed with any poynt of the treason, but onely reflectingly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they neglected to appeare at the Parliament, according to their summons, for which neglect onely, without any further charge, they were fined to pay to the King, the Lord <hi>Mordant</hi> ten thousand Marks, and the Lord <hi>Sturton</hi> six thousand, and to be prisoners during the Kings pleasure.

            <p>On the eight of <hi>May</hi> this year, the King by Proclamation prohibited all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reine Nations, that after <hi>August</hi> they should not fish upon any of the Coasts of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> nor the Isles adjacent, without the speciall Licence from the Commissioners in that behalfe Ordained.</p>
            <p>At this time the making of <hi>Allum,</hi> which heretofore with great charges, had been fetched from forreigne parts, was by diverse that laboured in it, and now lastly by Sir <hi>Iohn Burchier,</hi> brought to perfection in <hi>England,</hi> and therupon the King prohibited upon paine of confiscation, any <hi>Allum</hi> to be brought from beyond the Seas, and took the whole traffick therof to himself.</p>
            <p>And now the King according to an ancient custome, had ayde of His Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects thorough <hi>England:</hi> for making his eldest sonne Prince <hi>Henry</hi> Knight, which yet was Levied with great moderation, and the Prince to shew himselfe worthy of it: performed His first Feates of Armes at <hi>Barriers,</hi> with wonderfull skill and courage: being not yet full sixteene yeares of Age.</p>
            <p>It was now the eight yeere of King <hi>Iames</hi> His Reigne; being the yeare 1610, when Prince <hi>Henry</hi> being come to the age of seventeen yeares; It was thought fit, He should be Initiated into Royalty: and thereupon the thirtieth of <hi>May</hi> this yeare, He was Created Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> in most solemne manner; which was this; <hi>Garter</hi> King at Armes, bore the Letters Patents, the Earle of <hi>Sussex</hi> the Robes of Purple Velvet, the Earle of <hi>Huntington</hi> the Traine, the Earle of <hi>Cumberland</hi> the Sword, the Earle of <hi>Rutland</hi> the Ring, the Earle of <hi>Darby</hi> the Rod, the Earle of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> the Cape and Coronet, the Earle of <hi>Nottingham</hi> and <hi>North-Hampton</hi> supported the Prince: being in His Surcoate only and bare-headed: and in this manner being conducted to the King, attended on by the Knights of the Bathe, five and twenty in number, all great men, and great mens sons: The Earle of <hi>Salisbury</hi> principall Secretary, read the Letters Pattents: the Prince kneeling all the while before the King: and at the words accustomed, the King put on him, the Robe, the Sword, the Cape and the Coronet, the Rod and the Ring, and then kissed him on the cheeke, and so the solemnity ended.</p>
            <p>After this, it was thought fit, he should keep his Court by himselfe: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Sir <hi>Thomas Chaloner,</hi> a learned Gentleman, who had before been his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, was now made his Lord Chamberlaine, Sir <hi>Edw.

            <p>King <hi>Iames</hi> had long since shut up the Gates of <hi>Ianus,</hi> and was in Peace with all Princes abroad; his only care now was how to keep Peace at home; and to this end, the three first dayes of <hi>Iune,</hi> in his own person he heard the differences between the Ecclesiasticall and the Temporall Iudges, argued tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Protections out of the Kings<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> and hee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted certaine Lawes, to make them capable that should be admitted. First that they should maintaine the number of thirty foot souldiers in <hi>Ireland,</hi> for three yeares, after the rate of eight pence a day, and to pay the wages of one whole yeare, upon the passing of their Patent: Then that they should bee Gentlemen of Bloud of three Descents; and lastly, should have land of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, in possession or immediate Reversion, to the value of a thousand pounds <hi>per annum:</hi> And to keep the Order from swarming, he stinted it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the number of onely 200. and as the issue should faile, the Order to cease. But he that will look, how wel the end of the Institution, and the Laws of it have bin observed shall perhaps find it to be here, as it was in the Order of St. <hi>Michael</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> into which at first<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Count <hi>Palatine,</hi> being now strengthned with the allyance of the King of Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> was thought a fit man to be King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and accordingly was elected, by the States of that Kingdome, but he was no sooner invested in the Crowne; but the Emperour with great Forces assaulted him in <hi>Prague,</hi> and not only drove him with his wife and children from thence; but tooke from him also his owne Patrimony the <hi>Palatinate</hi>: so as though now a King he was fayne to flye to the States of the Low Countries for a place of residence, King <hi>Iames</hi> though he had never given his consent to the <hi>Palsegra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> to put the heire of the Kingdom into the <hi>Spaniards</hi> hands, yet grounding himself upon the saying: <hi>Fide lem si putaveris, facies:</hi> and drawne on by the insinuating speeches of Count <hi>Gundomar,</hi> not perhaps without some Indinction in the Marquis of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> was contented at last the Prince should goe. And so Prince <hi>Charles</hi> sending his ships about, and taking along with him only the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis of <hi>Buckingham</hi> (who in the time of his being in <hi>Spaine</hi> was created Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi>) <hi>Endymion Porter,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Francis Cottington</hi>: (two that were well acquainted with the Language and affaires of <hi>Spaine</hi>) he tooke his Iourney by the way of <hi>France,</hi> went to <hi>Paris,</hi> and secretly in disguise to the Court there, where he had the sight of that Lady, that might well have stayed him from going further, but yet on he went.</p>
            <p>In the meane time <hi>Gundomar</hi> a cunning man, and one that besides his Masters had ends of his owne, and could play his Game no lesse for his owne profit than his Masters Honour; as he had perswaded the King of the facility of the Match with <hi>Spayne,</hi> so he perswaded a certainty of it, especially amongst Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Ladies, by which meanes he brought no small store of Grists to his owne Mill, receiving from one Lady three hundred pounds to bee made Groome of the Stoole, when the Spanish Princesse should come; of another a good round summe to be made Mother of the Maydes, and of diverse other the like for other places.</p>
            <p>But the Prince being arrived in <hi>Spayne,</hi> was received indeed with all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations of love and kindnesse that could be devised, so as the charge of his entertainment was said to stand the King of <hi>Spayne</hi> in nine and forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Duckats; but yet his acquaintance with the Lady was much restrained, for in all the time of his staying in <hi>Spayne,</hi> which was no lesse than eight moneths, being from <hi>February</hi> to <hi>October</hi>) he saw her but very seldome, and that at good distances, never spake with her but twice, and that before company, besides that his speeches were limited, how much and what he should say, farre from any meanes of tying the knot betweene them which was pretended, what the cause should bee was much in obscurity; some thought that a difference betweene the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and the Count <hi>Olivares,</hi> the King of <hi>Spayne's</hi> great Favorite was a great hinderance of the proceeding: but other, and more likely that the <hi>Spanyard</hi> indeed never really intended the Match at all, but had drawne the Prince into <hi>Spayne</hi> for other Ends: but what those ends were, was no lesse uncertaine; (one thought it was done to hold the Prince in a treaty of marriage with a Daughter of <hi>Spayne,</hi> till the Daughters of <hi>France</hi> should bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed, thereby to keepe him from that allyance, but others and more likely, that the King of <hi>Spayne</hi> entertayned this Treaty with the King of great <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne,</hi> meaning to spinne it out till he had compassed some designes in the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> at least to make King <hi>Iames,</hi> most vigilant for those pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ts.</p>
            <p>But when much time had beene spent in protracting, upon pretence of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultities in obtaining the Popes dispensation, King <hi>Iames</hi> partly wearied with delay, but chiefely angred with delusion, sent to the Prince, with all speed to returne into <hi>England</hi>; which the Prince presently signified to the King
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:52616:306"/>
of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and had his leave to depart; but upon promise to continue the treaty of the marriage still. Though it was said, the Prince was gone but a few dayes on his journey, when a Post was sent to have stayed him, if he had been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken. But whether it was so or no, it was Gods providence that he came safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his ships, and in them safely into <hi>England</hi>; arriving at <hi>Portsmouth,</hi> where he was beheld of the people, with no lesse gladnesse, than the Sunne after a long Eclipse: and now his safe returning did both justifie King <hi>Iames</hi> his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in suffering him to goe, and the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> justice, in suffering him to come back: and was cause, that the people began to have a better opinion of the Spanish faith, than they had before. But now it presently brake out, that this match with <hi>Spaine</hi> could never take effect: for King <hi>Iames</hi> having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Declarations of the Articles touching the marriage, found many very strict and large for exercise of the Catholike Religion: but none at all for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of the <hi>Palatinate</hi>; which made him so much discontented, that he presently brake off all treaty of the marriage; and signified as much, not onely to the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> but to divers other Princes of Christendome: Vpon which breach, two great Points were presently had in consultation: One for preparing forces, for recovering the <hi>Palatinate</hi> by way of Armes, which could not be done by a way of friendship: and for this purpose, a Councell of warre was called, and a proposition resolved on both of men and money, for undertaking the enterprise: as also a great contribution by way of benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence was collected; towards which, the compiler of this worke, gave himselfe fifty pounds: as many other farre greater summes, though the collection went not thorow the whole Land<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> by reason there was hope given of a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able reconcilement: so as many that were not over-hasty in their payments escaped without contributing at all. The other point was for providing a fit wife for the Prince, in some other place. It was said, the States of <hi>Holland</hi> offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a very great portion in marriage to the Prince, if hee would match with some Lady of that Countrie: but matches are made in heaven, and there was a young Lady of <hi>France</hi> destined to his bed: and for this purpose, the Earle of <hi>Carlile,</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Holland</hi> were sent into <hi>France,</hi> to treat of a marriage with a younger daughter, of the Great <hi>Henrie</hi> the fourth, King of <hi>France</hi> decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and sister to the present King <hi>Lewis</hi>; which marriage afterward took effect, but was not accomplished in King <hi>Iames</hi> his dayes; who dyed soon after the agreement.</p>
            <p>It was now the yeare 1623. in which in <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Terme, there was a Call of fifteene Sarjeants at Law, who kept their Feast in the Middle-Temple Hall.</p>

In the second yeare of his raigne, a strange accident happened, to the terrour of all bloudy murtherers, which was this; one <hi>Anne Waters</hi> enticed by a lover of hers, consented to have her husband strangled, and then buried him secretly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the dung-hill in a Cow-house; whereupon the man being missing by his neighbours, and the wife making shew of wondring what was become of him: It pleased God, that one of the inhabitants of the Towne, dreamed one night, that his neighbour <hi>Waters</hi> was strangled, and buried under the dung-hill in a Cow-house; and upon declaring his dreame, search being made by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable, the dead body was found, as he had dreamed: and thereupon the wife was apprehended, and upon examination, confessing the fact, was burned. And now what hope can murtherers have of being concealed, when they are subject to be discovered by any mans dreame. The nineteenth of <hi>Ianuarie</hi> in his third yeare, a great <hi>Porpus</hi> was taken at <hi>Westham</hi>; in a small Creek, a mile and a halfe within the Land: and within few dayes after, a Whale came up within eight miles of <hi>London,</hi> whose body was seen divers times above water, and judged to exceed the length of the largest ship in the River: but when shee tasted the fresh water, and scented the Land, she returned into the Sea. In his fourth yeare, being the yeare 1607. a mighty west wind brought in the sea in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the River of <hi>Severne,</hi> with such violence, that in some places of <hi>Somerset-shire</hi> and <hi>Glocester-shire,</hi> the waters in divers Towns and Villages, grew higher than the tops of their houses; so as (notwithstanding all courses that could be taken, there were drowned in <hi>Somerset-shire</hi> 80. Persons, and damages done to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of twenty thousand pounds. At <hi>Coventrie</hi> also, the seventh of <hi>April</hi> so sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine a flood came into the Suburbs and City, that in one houre it rose in some places above 3 yards in height, to the great damage and hurt of many, and that which is much strange, as it suddenly came, so it suddenly abated: so as in foure houres and a halfe, it both came and went away. In his 6. year, being 1608. a frost began in <hi>Decem.</hi> which continued till <hi>April</hi> following, with such violence that not onely the <hi>Thames</hi> was so frozen, that Carts loden were driven over as on dry land, but many fowles and Birds perished, as also much herbage in gardens, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Artichoaks and Rosemarie were destroyed.

It is said, he had such a fashion in riding, that it could not so properly bee said he rid, as that his horse carried him; for hee made but little use of his Bridle, and would say, a horse never stumbled, but when hee was reined. Hee was of an admirable pregnancie of wit, and that pregnancy much improved by continuall study from his child-hood: by which, he had gotten such a promptnesse in expressing his mind, that his extemporall speeches were little inferiour to his premeditated writings.

               <p>MIlitary Men of Note, in a time of Peace, as the whole Raigne of King <hi>Iames</hi> was, we have no reason to expect; yet if we look amongst the Voluntaries that went to the Schoole of War in the <hi>Low-Countryes</hi>; we shall find a payre of brothers, that may stand in comparison, with the greatest Souldiers in the most Martiall times, S. <hi>Francis Vere,</hi> who as another <hi>Hanniball,</hi> who with his own eye, could see more in the Martiall Discipline, than common men can do with two; and Sir <hi>Horatio Vere</hi>; who as another <hi>Philopaemen,</hi> contained in a very little body, a very great, both skill and courage. But for Men of Note in Learning: as being in the time of a most learned Prince, there was never greater store; of whom these for example. In curiousnesse of Preaching, there was Doctor <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drewes</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi>; who hath left to posterity, a Century of such gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Sermons, that shews, he as well deserved the name of <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> as he that had it. In multiplicity of Reading, there was Doctor <hi>Reynolds</hi> of <hi>Corpus Christi</hi> Colledge in <hi>Oxford</hi>; who seemed as it were, a living Library; and one would have thaught his Memory to be a perfect <hi>Index</hi> of all the Books had ever beene written. In knowledge of Law there was Sir <hi>Edward Cook,</hi> Chiefe Iustice of the Kings Bench; who hath written such excellent Commentaries of the Law, that he seemes as another <hi>Bartholus</hi> or <hi>Baldus</hi> amongst us. In Elegancy of writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there was Sir <hi>Francis Bacon,</hi> Viscount Saint <hi>Albans</hi>; who besides his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founder Books of <hi>Novum Organum,</hi> hath written the Reigne of K. <hi>Henry</hi> the 7, in so sweet a style, that like <hi>Manna,</hi> it pleaseth the tast of all palats. In the skil of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities, there was <hi>William Camden,</hi> King at Armes; who hath set forth the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of <hi>Brittaine,</hi> and the life of Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> in so lively colours, that he seems to have brought <hi>Brittaine</hi> out of darknesse into light, and to keep Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> alive after her death.
