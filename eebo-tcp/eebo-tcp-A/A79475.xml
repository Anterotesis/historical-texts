            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

one Herbe for another, it is eaſily done, and
whileſt You are but making Eſſayes it may be eaſily

muſt be made according to the <hi>Diſpenſatory</hi> the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of the great Phyſician of Souls in his ſaving
Goſpel, that the bleſſing of Chriſt may be upon it,
and it may prove a ſoveraign Antidote for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
as well as removing of Church-offences. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt hath not entruſted any State to make new Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions,

ſeveral forms of Civill government in ſeverall Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian

and for ſubſtance the ſame Church-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in every Chriſtian State, though that govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
cannot be ſo peaceably exerciſed in ſome places
as in other; There is ſo much equity and prudence
<pb facs="tcp:113506:3"/>
in Evangelical rules and Inſtitutions, that they ought
to be obſerved in all Chriſtian States and Common-weals
thoroughout the world: <hi>Thoſe orders which
Chriſt hath ſent us by his Apoſtles muſt be obeyed,</hi> there
can be no <hi>exception</hi> againſt them, there muſt be no
<hi>Prohibition</hi> of them;<note place="margin">Rom. 16. v. 17, 18.</note> This is a Rule of Chriſt, that

<hi>Barnabas</hi> ordained Elders <hi>in every Church. Act.</hi> 14.
23. And when St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpoke of his <hi>departing out of
the world,</hi> and <hi>ſeeing their faces no more</hi> to whom he
had preached, he recommended the overſight or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the Church to Elders, aſſuring them
that <hi>the holy Ghoſt had made them overſeers over the
Church.</hi> Act. 20. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, 25, 28, 29. and therefore it is
eaſie to conclude, that the Elders were, <hi>Jure Divino,</hi>
by the will and appointment of Jeſus Chriſt, to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
the Apoſtles in the ordinary government of the
Church, and <hi>Chriſt promiſed to be with the Apoſtles,
and their ſucceſſours, not for two or three hundred yeers
onely, till ſome Magiſtrates did turn Chriſtians, but
even to the end of the world:</hi> and the holy Ghoſt ſeals
up the promiſe with <hi>Amen, Matth.</hi> 28. 20. If then
there be <hi>ten thouſand Churches</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> there ſhould
be <hi>ten thouſand Elderſhips;</hi> but the government by
theſe Elders is not Arbitrary, all the Cenſures which
they paſſe muſt be in ſome ſort Evangelicall, becauſe
agreeable to the Word of Chriſt; for the Elders are
<pb facs="tcp:113506:3"/>
not to govern in their <hi>own name,</hi> or in the name of the
Magiſtrate, no nor in the name of the people, but in the
name of Jeſus Chriſt, from whom they do <hi>immediately</hi>
receive their power and authority, and therefore are to
receive their orders and directions from the Goſpel of
Chriſt. The Chriſtian Magiſtrate ought to protect the
<hi>Elders,</hi> that they may peaceably exerciſe that Church-power
which is committed to them by Jeſus Chriſt, for
<hi>the Chriſtian Magiſtrate doth owe a ſpirituall ſubjection to
all the ordinances of Jeſus Chriſt. Eraſtus</hi> himſelf confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
that <hi>the Magiſtrate in ordering of ſacred things muſt not
depart one hairs breadth from the Word of God. p. 161. &amp;
162. li. 3. Confirm. Theſ.</hi> It will be very dangerous for a
Magiſtrate to do any thing of his own head about Church
affairs, and it will be as dangerous for Miniſters to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
in this weighty point; all the power that a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
hath ſetled upon him in <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. is ſetled on him
as he is a <hi>Miniſter of God,</hi> and therefore they who teach
Magiſtrates to deſpiſe the Authority of Miniſters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are <hi>but Miniſters of God,</hi> teach the Magiſtrates
to deſpiſe their own authority. Officers of Chriſts inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting,
and powers of Gods ordaining, muſt agree toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and uphold one another, or elſe both will be vilified:
Miniſters muſt not uſurp a civil power, nor Magiſtrates
lay claim to any Spiritual power properly ſo called: if a
man go about to thruſt two ſwords into one ſcabberd, let
him take heed he doth not ſplit the ſcabberd, and cut his
fingers. Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi> and thoſe of his mind ſay, that if the
Magiſtrate be a Church-officer, he muſt be called to his
office, and may be depoſed from it by the Church, and
and if the Magiſtrate be a <hi>ruling Elder,</hi> he is inferior to
<hi>teaching Elders,</hi> and deſerves leſſe honour, according to
that order, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. In his <hi>Iuſtificat. of Separat. p.</hi> 216.
<pb facs="tcp:113506:4"/>
if the Magiſtrate (ſay others) chalenge a Church-power,
and deny himſelf to be a Church-officer, then we have a
good Argument for <hi>Popular government,</hi> becauſe there is
a Church<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>power in ſome that are not Church officers;
and none can be entitled to Church-power, but by a
Church office, or by Church-memberſhip; and if by the
latter, then ſay they, <hi>Every member hath as much power as
the Magiſtrate;</hi> who knows not what the Anabaptiſts ſay
upon this point; The Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> hath declared
their judgement; and they who plead for a Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall
government have expreſſed themſelves after this
manner: The Governors of the Church have not their
power from the members of the Church, but from
Chriſt, they <hi>are inveſted with the power of Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> they
exerciſe his power, and do act in his name, and not in the
name of the Church, ſaith Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> in his <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ren. p.</hi>
50. And for my part, I ſhall readily grant that theſe Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
ought to tranſact all things which concern the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
of the people in ſuch a <hi>convincing way</hi> as may
beſt tend to <hi>Common edification</hi> and <hi>ſatisfaction. Church
ordinances are to be diſpenſed by the Church,</hi> that is, <hi>by the
Elders with conſent of the people,</hi> ſaith Mr. <hi>Rutherford,</hi> in
his late book <hi>p.</hi> 398. We ſhould quickly think of ſome
expedients for an happy agreement, if You would be
pleaſed to free us from <hi>the much feared Commiſſioners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Church power muſt needs be acknowledged to
have the <hi>proper notion</hi> and character of Authority in
the Elders, to which the multitude ought by a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi>
from Chriſt to be <hi>ſubject</hi> and <hi>obedient,</hi> as to an <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance</hi>
to guide them in their conſent, and therfore in the
ſentence of the Elders the ultimate for mall miniſteriall

2. That they may not deprive any Pariſh of a

the Miniſter, that they may raiſe their Fine, or a good

their hand upon their compoſition. 3. That they may

               <q>For I know him that he will command his children, and
his houſhold after him, and they ſhall keepe the way of
Jehovah to doe Juſtice and Judgement, that the Lord
may bring upon Abraham that which he hath ſpoken
of him.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>E pleaſed to conſider the Forme and Matter
of the Text: If you looke upon the Forme,
the Rationall Particle <hi>For</hi> points backward,
and ſhewes you that the Words containe a
Reaſon why God did acquaint <hi>Abraham</hi>
with his Intention concerning <hi>Sodom: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
had the honor to be taken into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with the God of Heaven,<note place="margin">Iſaiah 41. 8.</note> nay to be ſtiled the <hi>Friend of God:</hi>
and God deales with him as a friend, he communicates certain ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets,
<hi>Arcana Imperii</hi> to him, &amp; makes him in ſome particulars of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:113506:6"/>
his <hi>Privy-Councell;</hi> for he imparts to him his great Deſigne
(upon wicked <hi>Sodom</hi>) in a kinde of familiar and loving way.
What ſaith God, ſhall I conceale this Secret from my Friend
<hi>Abraham,</hi> bleſſed <hi>Abraham,</hi> in whoſe Seed all the Nations of
the Earth ſhall be bleſſed? I know him, and love him well, and
know that he will make a good uſe of it. <hi>For I know him that he
will command &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, If you looke upon the matter of the Text: it is in
one word, <hi>Abrahams Teſtimoniall</hi> ſubſcribed by God himſelfe;

what <hi>Abraham</hi> was for the preſent, but what he ſhould be for

the inclination of his will, and the bent of his affections.</p>
            <p>Secondly. For the future, God foretels, Firſt, VVhat <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
would doe for God: he would endeavour to bring all that
were <hi>under his Command,</hi> to be <hi>at Gods Command.</hi> Secondly,
VVhat God would doe for <hi>Abraham,</hi> namely <hi>Fulfill his Promiſe,
Keepe his Word.</hi> From the Forme of the Words as they yeeld a

            <p>God doth communicate <hi>Rare Secrets</hi> to certaine <hi>knowne and

            </p>
            <p>It is Gods Prerogative Royall to communicate Secrets to

<hi>John 17. 18. God</hi> makes choiſe of ſome men for State Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and ſome for Church-Service: and God doth communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
different Secrets to ſeverall men anſwerable to thoſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Services for which he hath choſen them. 1. To his Servants
the Prophets he did reveale <hi>Propheſies,</hi> foretell the ruine of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies

3. 7.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 2. Our Lord and Saviour did reveale <hi>Doctrinall Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets</hi>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:113506:6"/>
not that you ſhould keepe them cloſe and conceale them, but
that you might publiſh and declare them; I have not ſhunned
ſaith Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to declare unto you all the Counſell of God, <hi>Acts</hi>
20. 27: 3. God doth impart <hi>Secrets of State</hi> to men of Publique

            <p>God hath diſcovered his rich mercy, his undeſerved love,
and free grace by a Covenant of grace ſealed with the Bloud of
Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>Guilt cannot looke on Majeſty, and Majeſty is moſt
terrible in an Enemy and a Judge:</hi> but when Chriſt enterpoſes,
God is a reconciled God, and tender Father in Jeſus Chriſt,
<hi>In Chriſt Gods nature is lovely to us, and our perſons lovely to God.</hi>
God doth beſeech you, and Chriſt intreates you to be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led:
<hi>God ſhewes mercy to them that deſerve no mercy:</hi> There is an
<hi>Heart-breaking,</hi> and yet an <hi>Encouraging Secret, a Goſpell Secret:</hi>
theſe Secrets are uſually the firſt ground of faith, and hope:
Now faith and hope doe kindle in us a love to God, and love
doth moſt ſweetely breake the heart, and humble the ſoule: <hi>My
froward ſoule is now willing to abaſe it ſelfe before ſo good a God, a
God ſo willing to ſhew mercy to ſuch a wretch as I am who deſerve
no mercy:</hi> I ſee nothing in my ſelfe to encourage me to goe to
God, but I ſee enough in my ſelfe to <hi>drive</hi> me to him, and I
ſee enough in God for to <hi>encourage</hi> me to runne unto him: I ſee
mercy enough in God, merit enough in Chriſt, holineſſe enough
in the Spirit of holineſſe to perſwade me to runne to God for
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:113506:9"/>
grace as well as mercy, for faith and repentance as well as any
other graces, for pardon of ſinne and power againſt it.</p>
            <p>Come then be convinced of thine owne naughtineſſe in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
reſpects, humbly and yet chearefully caſt thy ſelfe upon
Gods free grace for pardon: depend upon Chriſts obedience
alone for righteouſneſſe, upon his holy Spirit the Comforter
for holineſſe and comfort; and ſay as <hi>Bradford</hi> did, <hi>I am Hell,
but God is Heaven, I am ſinne, but Chriſt is righteouſneſſe.</hi> Bleſſe
God for providing thee a Surety, a Saviour who is able to pay
all thy debts, and to ſupply all thy wants. I hope by this time
thou art encouraged to truſt Chriſt ſtedfaſtly, and love him hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily:
and <hi>if thou findest thy heart overcome by the love of God in
Chriſt, then thou mayeſt goe to Chriſt not out of pure neede, but pure
love:</hi> and Chriſt will give thee ſuch liberall entertainement, and
hearty welcome, that thou wilt prize and love Chriſt for <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,</hi>
and for his <hi>holineſſe,</hi> and all his excellencies as well as bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits:
and the more thou doſt <hi>prize</hi> him, the faſter will thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voute

               <hi>Sol.</hi> I anſwer, this Secret was imparted at leaſt <hi>in Ordine ad
Spiritualia,</hi> for religious purpoſes, and there are many edifying
Secrets contained in it; <hi>Abraham</hi> was not to repeate it as a ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
but as a Sermon to his Poſterity, that they might behold the
Majeſty of Jehovah, in this great example of Divine vengeance,
and be perſwaded to walke in the way of Jehovah, as it is in my
text: This Secret was communicated before hand, that the
burning of <hi>Sodom</hi> might not be imputed to chance, fortune, or
a violent tempeſt raiſed by the common courſe of nature, but to
the immediate hand of God: <hi>That the ſin-revenging Justice of
God might be magnified, and Poſterity deterred from the ſinnes of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
Pride, fulneſſe of bread, abundance of Idleneſſe, unnaturall luſt,
and baſe fornication, Ezek. 16. 49. 2 Pet.</hi> 2. 6.</p>

                  </gap> ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum Dei: <hi>P. Martyr</hi> in lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum.</note> This Secret was imparted to <hi>Abraham</hi> by way of
Prolepſis, for the preventing of an Objection, which might have
ſtaggered his faith: for God had given that Land to <hi>Abraham,
Lot</hi> had made choiſe of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and <hi>Abrahams</hi> Portion bordered
upon <hi>Lots,</hi> and therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> would have beene excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
ſtaggered at the Overthrow of <hi>Sodom,</hi> if God had not
acquainted him with this Secret before hand: And therefore I
have ſo freely diſcourſed of Encouraging Secrets, that I might
remove thoſe blocks at which our faith is moſt apt to ſtumble.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, By the imparting of this Secret, <hi>Lots</hi> policy is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed,
and <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſelfe-denying faith commended: <hi>Lot</hi>
chooſes the richer ſoyle, but the fouler ſeate, becauſe of worldly
accommodations; but on a ſudden the wickedneſſe of the place
calls for a devouring fire, which licks up all the wealth, and
buries all the glory of <hi>Sodom</hi> in duſt andaſhes: this Secret is not
ſecular, which takes off the heart from all ſecular accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:113506:10"/>
and teaches men to chooſe their ſeate or dwelling, not for
ſecular advantages, but for Spirituall Accommodations.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, It was requiſite to ſhew you when a man is in an
<hi>approved</hi> condition, and how a man may be brought to lay hold
upon the Covenant, becauſe when God (ſpeaking of <hi>Abraham</hi>)
ſaith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>I know him,</hi> the meaning is, I approve him as a man in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
with me: he is a ſincere upright man, and will be true
to me in the moſt declining times.</p>
            <p>God takes notice of his Saints and Servants with a <hi>Knowledge
of Approbation, a ſweete loving knowledge which implyes a deare and
tender reſpect:</hi> but God takes notice of every particular perſon,
with a <hi>Knowledge of Obſervation:</hi> for God obſerves all our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,
habits, and inclinations, all our thoughts, plots, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes,
all our deſires, intentions, reſolutions, words and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and will call us to an account for all in the preſence of
Saints and Angels, before the Tribunall of Chriſt; when Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites
and Apoſtates, ſcandalous and impenitent perſons, who
lived and died in ſinne, appeare at that terrible day of accounts,
Chriſt will proteſt unto them, <hi>that he never knew them:</hi> that is,
<hi>He never approved them, Math.</hi> 7. 23. Nay for the preſent, Chriſt
doth uſually ſet a brand upon all falſe-hearted men, though they
are highly conceited of themſelves, and cried up by others for
prudence and piety: yet Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I know ſuch and ſuch, but I
will never truſt them, becauſe I know them, and I will lay them open
to my people that they may know them,</hi> for they will deceive all
that truſt them: <hi>Some mens ſinnes goe afore to judgement, and ſome
mens follow after: for they that are otherwiſe, cannot be hid, 1 Tim.</hi>
5. 24, 25. When Chriſt wrought miracles, many beleeved in his
name, but Chriſt did not truſt them, for <hi>he knew what was in
man, in every man: for he knew all men, John</hi> 2. 23, 24, 25. Chriſt
workes miracles in our dayes, and there are many that ſeeme to
beleeve in his name: but if they be not ſincere, Chriſt will lay
them open: for it is impoſſible to deceive the Searcher of hearts,
and Judge of Secrets, our Omniſcient and Impartiall God.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, We may learne from hence, That what ever God
doth approve in man, hee doth worke in man: for this
knowledge is not a Notionall, but a Practicall effectuall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;

               </note> God knowes all things that are poſſible, becauſe he knowes
his owne Power: God knowes all things future, becauſe he
knowes his owne Will: for nothing can paſſe out of the ranke

Future before ſome Act or Decree of Gods Will hath paſſed for

it to be future, and therefore the futurition of a thing is not
knowable, no not <hi>in Signo Rationis,</hi> before God hath paſſed a

Scripture reaſon, <hi>God ſets his love upon us, becauſe he loves us,
Deut.</hi> 7. 7, 8. And out of free grace and undeſerved love decrees
to make us holy, and ſo foreſees and approves our holineſſe.
The Knowledge then in the text being a Knowledge of Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation,
ſuppoſes the free grace, undeſerved love, Immutable and
Effectuall Decree of God, which is the fountaine of grace and
glory. In bad actions, we can hardly take enough to our ſelves;
for the divell cannot make me ſinne, unleſſe he aske me leave,
and gaine my conſent: but in good actions I can never aſcribe
too much to God, who ſaves me out of free grace, without any
contributions of helpe, or attributions of worth ſeene or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeene
in my fraile and ſinfull ſelfe.</p>
            <p>True it is, God doth beſtow his ſaving benefits in a certaine
Order, ſo that one of his Favours doth make way for another:
But his ſecond favours cannot be deſerved by his firſt, becauſe
his firſt favours make way for his ſecond, and both proceede
from his free grace.</p>
            <p>The Decree of God is a ſure foundation, the Fore-knowledge
of God is a certaine Seale: <hi>The Foundation of God ſtandeth ſure,
having this Seale, The Lord knoweth them that are his.</hi> There
is the Privy-Seale: the Broade-Seale is ſtamped upon them, In

               <hi>Abraham</hi> did not leave his children and ſervants to their owne
<hi>Genius,</hi> their owne counſels, their owne luſts: though it is
certaine, that divers of them would have thanked him for ſuch a

as <hi>Abraham</hi> was,<note place="margin">Gen. 17. 23.</note> and might have pretended that they were

of Conſcience,</hi> and <hi>Liberty of Luſt:</hi> and therefore would

            <p>

he will make his children know that he is their Father,

            <p>Firſt, His Authority, he was a King, a Prieſt, a Prophet in

the mighty God, the great <hi>Creatour,</hi> the high <hi>Poſſeſſour,</hi>

            <p>Secondly, His Prudence, he laide no unneceſſary burthen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

God did firſt catechiſe <hi>Abraham,</hi> and then <hi>Abraham</hi> was the
Doctor of his family, and catechiſed his houſhold: there is no
doubt but he did <hi>adviſe</hi> his houſhold in Prudentials; but he did
<hi>command</hi> them in Points of Faith and Worſhip, to walke in the
way of Jehovah. It is the moſt imprudent thing in the world
not to diſtinguiſh betweene <hi>Prudentials,</hi> and <hi>Articles</hi> of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Articles of Faith.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, His Love to the pretious ſoules of his children,

and Inſtruction of a godly Maſter were brought home to God,

            <p>Fifthly, His Faithfulneſſe, For all his Commands were Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular,
<hi>Abraham</hi> kept cloſe to the rule, and therefore neither
ſonne nor ſervant could pretend Liberty of Conſcience, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part

perfect, it is for certaine that they could never be perfected by
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:113506:13"/>
humane traditions, which are ſo full of imperfection.</p>
            <p>A Synod is a ſolemne Ordinance of Jeſus Chriſt, and I looke
upon that Counſell <hi>Acts</hi> 15. not onely as a <hi>Precedent,</hi> but as a
<hi>Warrant</hi> for the Examination of matters of <hi>Fact,</hi> as well as Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of Faith: And ſuch a determination of both, as doth not
onely <hi>direct,</hi> but <hi>oblige</hi> ſeverall Congregations <hi>to doe their duty</hi> by
vertue of that Miniſteriall Authority which is ſtamped upon
ſuch a Synod or Counſell by an Ordinance of Jeſus Chriſt; And
yet unleſſe it were in that Counſell, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. the Church did
for about three hundred yeares together convince and condemne
Heretiques by ſcripture, before any generall Councels were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered,
or the Popes throne erected. I have beene at paines to
remove a great deale of rubbiſh that lay in my way, but now
I ſhall beginne to build.</p>
            <p>1. Governours of families are Gods Deputies, they muſt
command for God, and give an account to him: all the power
that any man can challenge in his family, as an Husband, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Maſter, is a ſubordinate and limited power, not an Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
or Abſolute power: for <hi>we muſt teſtifie our dependance
upon God, and Subiection to him,</hi> by commanding our wives,
children ſervants, in the Lord, and for the Lord.</p>
            <p>2. Order is the cauſe of peace; where there is no order in a
family, there can be no peace; and it is impoſſible that there
ſhould be any happy Order without the higheſt Order, I meane
a Religious Order, which ſets God uppermoſt in the family,
and keepes the whole Houſhold, Maſter, Miſtreſſe, and all in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to the God of Order, the God of Peace; the truth is,
<hi>Religion puts a family in Order, and then keepes it ſo:</hi> Policy may
helpe to furniſh an houſe with worldly accommodations, for the
ſupport of our outward man; but when men ſeeke temporall
advantages with a neglect, if not contempt of God and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
Policy is but a kinde of ſubtile diſorder and demure foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery;
<hi>Achitophell</hi> ſets his houſe in order, but you know what
followed: becauſe he had not ſet either his heart or houſe in a
religious order, though he was eſteemed an Oracle of God for
wiſedome, he lived an ungodly life, and died a deſperate and
ſhamefull death; and all Polititians may learne by his fall, that
<hi>Policy without Piety can never give a man ſatisfaction whileſt he
lives, nor comfort when he dyes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:113506:13"/>
Thirdly, Families are the firſt roote of humane conſort and
communion; for Government was firſt ſetled in thoſe little Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries:
now if the roote be rotten, what will the branches be?
A Kingdome conſiſts of ſo many families united by one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Covenant for the Common good: and if the families
be poyſoned and corrupted, what will become of the townes
and the cities, and how will the Kingdome flouriſh?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, How can we expect a bleſſing upon our family,
or hope to convey Gods bleſſing to our Poſterity, if we doe not
labour to ſet up God, by ſetting up of godlineſſe in our family.
<hi>Abraham</hi> had the promiſe of a bleſſed Seede, but <hi>Abraham</hi> was
to command his children and ſervants to walke in the way
of Jehovah, that the bleſſing of Jehovah might be upon
them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> But you will ſay, that in <hi>Abrahams</hi> time there was no ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Miniſtery, and therefore Maſters of families were to cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſe
their children and ſervants; but there is not the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
now, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> I anſwer, that when there was a ſetled Miniſtery under
the Law, there was a ſpeciall Command for men to teach not
their ſonnes onely, but their ſonnes ſonnes. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 9. and to
<hi>whet</hi> the Precepts of God upon their children, to ſharpen their
wits, and ſettle their mindes by diligent inſtruction, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.
from the fourth verſe to the ſeventh. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> looked upon
thoſe as dead and buried, who neglected this duty: <hi>The grave,</hi>
ſaith he, <hi>cannot prayſe thee, nor they that goe downe into the pit hope
for thy truth; the living, the living he ſhall prayſe thee, the father
to the children ſhall make knowne thy truth, Iſai.</hi> 38. 19. Parents
are or may be better acquainted with the <hi>diſpoſition,</hi>

doe commonly learne more prophaneſſe at home, then they can
learne good at Church or ſchoole: the negligence or ill exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of their parents, or ſome in the family, doth uſually bring a
<hi>curſe</hi> upon the <hi>ſad paines</hi> of the moſt laborious Miniſter; Parents
then and Miniſters muſt be helpers to one another in Jeſus
Chriſt; godly Parents catechiſe their children in private, that
their mindes and hearts may be prepared for the receiving of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:113506:14"/>
thoſe truthes which ſhall be taught them in the Publique Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery:
Parents repeate Sermons in private, Miniſters preſſe
catechiſticall points home in publique, and ſo there is a ſweete

of all thoſe that are committed to their charge. There is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie,<note place="margin">Filiab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

children whoſe education is different, I neede adde no more;
<hi>Abſolom</hi> for his beauty, and <hi>Adonijah</hi> for his comely ſtature were
more cockered by <hi>David</hi> then <hi>Salomon,</hi> they had more liberty,
and <hi>Salomon</hi> more learning, being more hardly and religiouſly
bred, but you know how <hi>Abſalom</hi> and <hi>Adonijah</hi> miſcarried, and
<hi>Salomon</hi> was the Crowne of his Fathers joy, and the heire of
his Crowne.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bethel</hi> was a ſuperſtitious place and therefore the children
no doubt had learned of their ſuperſtitious parents to revile the
moſt powerfull Miniſters of God: (for <hi>they that affect a kinde

callings, relations, to command for God.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Every man hath an houſhold within himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Governours of families have an houſhold.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, You that are Parliament men are Members of an
Honourable Houſe, and the onely way to preſerve your Honour
is to walke in the way of Jehovah.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Kingdome is your Houſhold, the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
is your Family, and by doing Juſtice and Judgement
you may not onely command, but perſwade the Kingdome to
walke in the way of Jehovah.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Every man hath an houſhold within himſelfe, a little
world, and therefore ſure a great houſhold within the Circuit
of his inward and outward man. Our firſt and greateſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
is over our owne ſelves; and the truth is, that we are not

               </gap> to rule and governe our families, untill
we have learned how to rule our ſelves; we are not fit to <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
till we have put our ſpirits under an higher and better ſpirit
then our owne: He that rules his owne ſpirit, is a better man then
he that takes or rules a City, Prov.</hi> 16. 32. If I my ſelfe doe not
walke in the way of Jehovah, I ſhall never get my family into
it, or keepe them in it. <hi>Perſonall holineſſe doth fit us for Houſhold
godlineſſe: Zacheus</hi> did not endeavour to bring his family into
the way of faithfull <hi>Abraham,</hi> till he himſelfe became a Sonne
of <hi>Abraham, Luke</hi> 19. 9. Salvation comes to our hearts, before
we are ſeriouſly Inſtrumentall to bring it into our houſes: Chriſt
ſaid to <hi>Zacheus</hi> upon the day of his converſion, <hi>This day is ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation

if you will be members of Chriſt, you muſt be ſonnes of

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:113506:15"/>
grace is propounded in both, though under very different admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt
ations. <hi>Abraham</hi> was <hi>a man of an Evangelicall Spirit under
the Old Teſtament:</hi> nothing could ſatisfie his raiſed ſpirit, and
enlarged heart but Jeſus Chriſt: God made him a gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 1. but Lord God ſaith he, what wilt thou give
me ſince I goe childleſſe, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. as if he had ſaid, how ſhall I
have thee for my God and Father, reward and Saviour, if the
promiſed Seed who is to breake the head of the Serpent, all the
power and policy of the divell, doe not ſpring from my loynes?
It is cleare and evident, that <hi>Abrahams heart was not ſet upon any
common ſeed, but that promiſed ſeed in which all the Nations of the
earth were to be bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Gen.</hi> 13. 15. is meant of Chriſt, <hi>To thy Seed, which is Chriſt, Gal.
3. 16. Abraham</hi> was not juſtified by beleeving that he ſhould
have a numerous of ſpring, but by beleeving in Chriſt, <hi>he ſaw the
day of Chriſt by faith, reioyced in hope, and beleeved againſt hope:</hi>
and if we will be his ſonnes, the Apoſtle ſhewes what we muſt
beleeve in the fourth chapter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and
the three laſt verſes. That by the way; but if you will fully
prove your ſelves to be ſonnes of <hi>Abraham,</hi> you muſt have the
ſame minde and heart, the ſame faith that <hi>Abraham</hi> had, and
walke in the ſame way and ſteps that <hi>Abraham</hi> did, as farre as
Evangelicall adminiſtrations will permit, for you muſt obſerve
that difference: be pleaſed then ſadly to conſider theſe few
Obſervations.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Abraham</hi> was a man much given to Heavenly medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
a fundamentall duty of Religion, which layes the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke,
and contrives the Plat-forme of Houſhold-godlineſſe.
<hi>Abraham</hi> had his minde fixed, and his heart warmed with medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
that he might be raiſed and enlarged for the higheſt ſtrains
of ſpirituall devotion, when God gave him a promiſe that <hi>Sarah</hi>
ſhould have a ſon, <hi>Abraham meditates upon the promiſe till his
heart was even enraviſhed with love and ioy:</hi> The good man is
pleaſed in his minde, and <hi>laughes in his heart,</hi> and breaketh forth
into Soliloquies upon this occaſion, and when his heart is by
theſe contemplations and ſolitary diſcourſes, put into a praying
frame, put into tune as it were, O then he prayes, <hi>Gen. 17. 17,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:113506:15"/>
18. Prayer is not the childe of wit and phantaſie, it is the rapture of
an elevated ſpirit, the heavenly dew of a broken heart:</hi> I meane a
ſpirit elevated by a ſpirit of faith, and a heart broken with the
ſpirit of love. Would you be ſons of <hi>Abraham?</hi> learne this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Logique, this ſacred Eloquence, <hi>Let meditation fit you for
Soliloquies, and Soliloquies for Prayer. Meditation helpes the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
purges the conſcience, purifies the heart, reformes the life;</hi> It
makes all our knowledge to become practicall, becauſe it affects
the heart with thoſe truthes which we beleeve; it kindles love,
inflames zeale, and when our love burnes, and our zeale flames,
we ſhall warme others by ſpeaking from our owne hearts to the
hearts of our family, the convincing and quickning truth of
God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Abraham was an humble and mortified man.</hi> When
he received a gracious meſſage from God in pretious promiſes,
he falls downe upon his face, not out <hi>of a ſuperſtitious phantaſie,
but out of a ſweet ſelfe-abhorrency in adoration of Gods Maieſty, and
thankefulneſſe for his mercy.</hi> You may read of this <hi>Son-like reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
twice in one chapter, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 3. 17. O let us conſider <hi>Gods
Maieſty and our baſeneſſe, Gods purity and our ſinfulneſſe, Gods free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace,
and our unworthyneſſe, Gods rich bounty, and our unthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
that we may learne to abaſe our ſelves, and exalt our God; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>

if he had ſaid, what am I that I ſhould approach into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of ſo great a Majeſty, Alas, I am but duſt and aſhes, and
yet I take upon me to ſpeake to Jehovah the God of glory: Our

the leper, <hi>Math.</hi> 26. 6. and another time in the city at the houſe

of ſuch a compoſed ſpirit, that the dainties of a feaſt, or the fragrant
ſmell of coſtly Oyntments may not tempt us to take off our thoughts
from humbling and mortifying conſiderations:</hi> Whileſt we are fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting,

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:113506:16"/>
they were feaſting and drinking wine: <hi>Conſider it all you that ſit
in the Congregation of the mighty: though you ſit there as Gods, you
muſt dye like men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Abraham</hi> was a <hi>ſelfe-denying</hi> man; at the Command of
God, he left his father, forſook his country, renounced his idols,
circumciſed himſelfe and his houſhold: though it was painefull
to the fleſh, and ſeemed immodeſt, nay ridiculous to carnall men,
and coſt him his bloud: he turned <hi>Hagar</hi> and <hi>Iſmael</hi> out of doors,
and was ready to ſacrifice his deareſt <hi>Iſaack,</hi> though <hi>the Command
ſeemed contrary to nature and religion, to Gods promiſe and his owne
ſalvation:</hi> You may ſuppoſe him diſputing with himſelfe much
after this manner, <hi>What ſhall I ſacrifice my ſonne Iſaack, the ſonne
of my age and love, my heart, my bowels tell me that it is unnaturall:
what will my Sarah, my ſervants, the Heathens ſay? who will ever
live within my walls, or be of my religion, when I have cut the throat
of my deareſt ſonne? Lord, where is my bleſſing, where is thy promiſe,
nay where is my faith? How ſhall the promiſed Seed ſpring from my
loynes if Iſaack die? En dignam Deo ſpectaculum:</hi> this was a ſight
worthy of God to looke upon, a worke worthy for God to
performe: God gave <hi>Abraham</hi> a ſelfe-denying ſpirit, and that
carried him through all. We cannot be ſonnes of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
Members or followers of Chriſt without ſelfe-deniall, <hi>Marke 8.
34. I muſt deny my graces, ſervices, ſufferings, my whole regenerate
ſelfe in point of Juſtification, as I muſt deny my corrupt ſelfe in point
of mortification, and muſt deny even my naturall ſelfe, my naturall
life, and the comforts of it, if I am called to ſuffer Martyrdome, Luke</hi>
14. 26. 33. But alas, how many are there that are more willing
to deny Chriſt and deny the Scriptures, then to deny themſelves?
This is a lamentation, and ſhall be for a lamentation: <hi>Few men
are willing to circumciſe their hearts, mortifie their luſts, caſt out their
Iſmaels, offer up their Iſaacks, part with their eſtates and lives for
Jeſus Chriſt; Come let us deny our reaſon, and ſubmit to Gods
Counſell, deny our wills, and ſubmit to Gods Will, quiet our paſſions,
and ſubmit to Gods Providence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Abraham was a man of faith, the father of the faithfull,</hi>
he beleeved againſt ſence, againſt reaſon, carnall reaſon, nay <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
hope he beleeved in hope, Rom.</hi> 4. 18. Was it reaſonable to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:113506:16"/>
expect that a childe ſhould ſpring from withered loynes, from a
dead body? <hi>The Obiection was conſiderable, but Abraham was ſo
wiſe as not to conſider it: he conſidered not his owne body now dead,
ver. 19. The moſt plauſible Objections in the world, are not one whit
conſiderable, if framed againſt the plaine word of God.</hi> It is the cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſinne of this age, to ſet up the wit and fancies of men in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition
with the Authority of God, the Word of God, and
therefore I deſire to ſpeake freely, I would I had time to ſpeake
fully; men doe conſider witty objections too much, and the
word of God too little: If we were not benighted at high noon,
that is, if we did not ſhut out the light, it were impoſſible that
ſo many <hi>rotten opinions</hi> ſhould ſeeme beautifull, nay glorious in
the eyes of conſiderable men; you know what the Philoſopher
ſaith, <hi>Rotten things ſhine in the darke:</hi> Plauſible Objections are <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Copwebs:</hi> I admire the art of them, yet I know that they
may be framed out of the <hi>bowels of a ſpider,</hi> and they are the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

<hi>Abraham,</hi> let us be fully perſwaded, and let us not be ſtaggered,

Praedicament of ſubſtance, but the very ſubſtantiality of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance

If then you call God ſubſtance, that word is not ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall

Therefore ſome that have beene ſtrict and accurate, doe

becauſe <hi>he doth excell even excellency it ſelfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reaſon tells us that <hi>this God deſerves to be worſhipped: that he is
wiſe enough to judge what worſhip is due to him:</hi> and that it is
certaine he hath revealed his Judgement ſomewhere, that he

And where hath God revealed this but in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?

ever. For all fleſh is graſſe, and all the glory of man as the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

away, but the Word of the Lord endureth for ever. But where
is it? ſaith ſome poore ſoule, <hi>for</hi> I am to ſeeke where it is; <hi>Why
here it is, ſaith the Apoſtle: in this Goſpell reade on, the laſt
words of the chapter will give thee full ſatisfaction.</hi> And
this is the Word, which by the Goſpell is preached unto you; <hi>Say
not then in your hearts, who ſhall aſcend into Heaven

you, <hi>Oh let it be nearer to you yet: let the word of faith
which is preached out of this Goſpell, be a word of faith
ingrafted in thy heart: thou mayeſt ſafely build thy faith
upon the holy Scriptures, for they are the words of God,
and</hi> though the Kingdomes of the earth be ſhaken, yet the Words
of God will ſtand, and ſtand for ever. <hi>Be convinced and fully

but be confident of it:</hi> If the Word of God faile, I will give
thee leave to curſe me upon thy death-bedde, for I can with
reverence and confidence appeale to God: and ſay, Lord, if
in this point, I am deceived, thou thy ſelfe haſt deceived
mee.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>Abraham was the Freind of God:</hi> We are all by
nature enemies to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we doe naturally conceive an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſticall
hatred againſt him, onely becauſe he is a God
to Truth, Juſtice, and Purity, and threatens to torment
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:113506:18"/>
us for thoſe ſinnes which we are unwilling to forſake:
wicked men wiſh with all their hearts that God were not
ſo pure, juſt and true, as indeede he is, and muſt be, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
they would have him to be no God at all; Are you not
aſhamed of this Atheiſticall quarrell? Conſider that <hi>God is
truth, can an underſtanding minde hate truth</hi> which is the very
dareling of the underſtanding? God is <hi>goodneſſe</hi> it ſelfe,
and can thy will hate that which is <hi>good,</hi> even goodneſſe it
ſelfe, infinite goodneſſe? <hi>God is love, and canſt thou be out
of love</hi> with love it ſelfe? Doeſt thou not ſee that <hi>thy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is extreamely perverted, and become even unnaturall?</hi>
but let me tell you that our enmity, though thus <hi>unnatural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
naturall,</hi> and groſſely Atheiſticall, is highly aggravated
by the Love of Chriſt. Chriſt died to ſave me, though he
knew that I would be his deadly enemy, and offers me a
pardon ſealed with his precious bloud: and therefore <hi>I doe
even hate my ſelfe for hating Chriſt, and am willing to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
as well as juſtified by Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> Chriſts minde ſhall
be my minde, Chriſts will ſhall be my will, I deſire to be
<hi>a man according to Chriſts owne heart:</hi> I will be a freind to
Chriſt, though I ſeeme to be an enemy to my ſelfe, <hi>I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
my ſelfe a freind to all the freinds, and an enemy to all the
enemyes of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> Oh I feele I bleſſe God, I feele
my ſelfe tranſported even beyond my ſelfe with <hi>raptures,</hi> and
<hi>extaſies</hi> of love: I am ſenſible of Gods eternall love to me,
and I cannot be content with any leſſe then an eternity to
expreſſe my love to him: I will ſubſcribe my ſelfe, <hi>the
eternall freind of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, <hi>Abraham</hi> was a <hi>Covenanter,</hi> a perfect Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<hi>Walke before me, and be thou perfect or upright, and I
will make a Covenant with thee,</hi> ſaith God to <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi>

as in the preſence of Jehovah: <hi>You muſt walke by fayth, 2 Cor.
5. 7. and by ſincere obedience, Epheſ.</hi> 2. 10. Let your heart be

as done in reſpect of Gods acceptance and your comfort.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:113506:18"/>
Our Saviour concludes his ſpirituall Expoſition of the
Law with this Exhortation, <hi>Be you therefore perfect, as your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
which is in Heaven is perfect.</hi> Matth. 5. 48. to ſhew, that
our ſincere obedience is called perfect, becauſe <hi>our obedience
in reſpect of our deſire muſt be as large as the perfection of Gods
holy will revealed in his Word;</hi> nay he muſt endeavour, and
not onely deſire to come up to the rule in the moſt nice
points, in every Iota and Title of the ſpirituall Law, and
glorious Goſpel; they who do ordinarily commit known
ſins, and neglect known duties, will not be eſteemed <hi>Honeſt
Covenanters;</hi> they who ſtudy excuſes, or frame objections to

wayes, ſhall die.</hi> Prov. 19. 16.</p>
            <p>7. <hi>Abraham</hi> was a good Houſe-keeper, he took care of
his family; and ſo I paſſe from Perſonal Holineſſe to Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold-godlineſſe.
We muſt command our children, and
Houſhold to walk in the way of Jehovah; <hi>The whole family

<hi>Imperative,</hi> from the godlineſſe of the Governor, <hi>He
ſhould command;</hi> Give me leave to enquire into the ſtate of
your families, are they Nurſeries of Piety? do you look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

ſons of God, and heirs of Heaven? Do you deſire to be ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall,<note place="margin">Pſal. 127. 13.</note>
as well as naturall Fathers to all your Children; I
am as it were born again in my childe, oh that my childe

much of my own image in him, oh that the image of
Chriſt might be ſtamped upon him! theſe are the heavenly
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:113506:19"/>
ejaculations of holy parents. We muſt ſay of our children
as <hi>Jacob</hi> did of his, <hi>Theſe are the children which God hath gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly
given:</hi> oh let them be graciouſly educated. Have a
ſpeciall care of your ſons, they are the <hi>ſupport</hi> of the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
O teach them to <hi>ſupport</hi> Religion alſo, that they may
<hi>bear up Chriſts Name as well as yours.</hi> Have a tender care of your
daughters, for by them other Families are linked to yours,
therfore ſeaſon them with Religion, and you may by them
propagate Religion to many Families. Would you have
your Heirs good Stateſmen, teach them how <hi>to whet their
tools at the Sanctuary, to oyl their wheels with prayer, and ſteel
their Engines with Religion,</hi> that they may ſeek the kingdom
of God, and his righteouſnes in the firſt and higheſt place,
and ſecular advantages in <hi>a ſubſervient way.</hi> But when, and
how ſoon ſhould we begin to teach our children? why tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>when they are able to learn any thing that's bad, it is high time
to teach them ſomething that is good:</hi> when they can ſtammer
out an oath, or liſp near a blaſphemy, it is high time to
teach them their Catechiſme, and inſtruct them in Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Chriſtianity. Teach them their Catechiſme in
<hi>A. B. C.</hi> The holy Spirit hath compoſed ſome Abcedarian
Pſalms in Achroſticall verſes, according to the order of the
Hebrew Alphabet, that children might learn an Alphabet
of godlineſſe, and parents teach their children the firſt Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

ſhould ſet heavenly truths in freſh and lively colours, that the

of ſpirituall things;</hi> God doth reveal heavenly truths
in certain apt ſimilitudes, which do exceedingly pleaſe the
phantaſie, becauſe whileſt our ſoul is joyned to our body,
nothing can come into the underſtanding but by the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and ſo through the phantaſie; and therefore a ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:113506:19"/>
doth exceedingly help the underſtanding. God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends
to our weak capacity, when he clothes an heavenly
truth with an earthly repreſentation, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 12. I have told

our unbelief and diſobedience, if when we have ſuch helps
we do not profit by inſtruction; you know <hi>the Sacraments
help our faithly our ſences, and ſo by our phantaſie, and phantaſie
will return a quick meſſage to the affections, and the affections will
ſway the will, and conſequently the whole man;</hi> and therefore if
we can pleaſe the phantaſie of a childe, by repreſenting the
joyes of Heaven to him under the notion of a Banquet, or
a crown of Gold, and ſo invite him to Heaven, and ſweeten
all the exerciſes of Religion to him; and on the other ſide
terrifie him from ſin, by repreſenting the torments of Hell
to him under the notion of fire and brimſtone, <hi>and then ſhew</hi>
him that there's ground for theſe repreſentations in the
Word of God, you'l at once help his underſtanding, and
work upon his affections, and withall lay a firm ground
for his faith, <hi>that his faith</hi> laying hold on the Divine reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation

firſt thing that you ſhould teach children, is ſomewhat that
concerns the ordering of their affections, what <hi>they ought
to delight in, and what they ought to grieve for,</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>what they ought to love, and what they ought to hate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Pray for your children as well as inſtruct them; <hi>Si nil

it, daily, the <hi>daily</hi> ſacrifice was called the <hi>continuall</hi> ſacrifice;
or as others expound it, pray for them ſeaſonably upon all
occaſions. Do not onely pray for your children in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
but pray as <hi>Job</hi> ſacrificed, for every particular childe,
<hi>according to the number of them all,</hi> Job 1. 5. As you provide a
diſtinct portion, and a diſtinct ſuit of clothes for every
childe; ſo provide, I mean, <hi>Sue cut a ſpeciall bleſſing by a diſtinct
prayer for every particular childe.</hi> You muſt be jealous over
your children with a godly jealouſie as <hi>Job</hi> was, <hi>If you
ſuſpect that they have ſinned, let that ſuſpition bring you upon your
knees;</hi> and cauſe you to lift up a prayer for them with all
your ſtrength; if you do but fear that they may ſin, labour
by good counſell to prevent their ſin. Finally, give good
example to your children, and take care of them when
they are grown up and married from you: when <hi>Jobs</hi> chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

of their ſouls, and ſent to them to ſanctifie themſelves,
which was to prepare themſelves for holy ſervice. <hi>Job</hi> 1.

            <p>Do not forget your beloved wife, the choiceſt part of
your ſelf and family; ſhe will never be at your command,

take care of her precious ſoul, inſtruct her, pray with
her, dwell with her as a man of knowledge, that you may
walk together hand in hand to heaven, like heirs of grace,

Beaſts, you work and feed your beaſts, but never inſtruct
them; and you make as very beaſts of your ſervants, if you
do not inſtruct them in the way of Jehovah, for you do
onely find them work and food. Tell your family what
conſiderations did at firſt move your heart, and work upon
your ſpirits, that the ſame conſiderations may by Gods

may improve thy zeal, and bring a bleſſing on thy poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie

My firſt motion is, That we may not be beaten off from
thoſe principles in which we agree, becauſe there are ſome
things about which we differ.</p>
            <p>2. That it may be diligently conſidered, how far we
agree; few men beleeve that there is ſo ſweet an agreement
in ſo many uniting Principles between godly, prudent, and
charitable men of different perſwaſions, for the preventing
and removing of all ſcandals, as indeed there is.</p>
            <p>3. That thoſe many fair Expedients which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded

though <hi>a Kingdom may be quickly corrupted, yet it cannot be ſo

may emprove the motion to the heighth, be pleaſed to
keep a Private Faſt, and call ſome judicious and ſelf-deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
men to Preach before you, who will deal plainly, and
faithfully with you in the niceſt points. My Reaſons to
back the Motion are briefly theſe.</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe you were never in greater danger then now,
you are exerciſed with temptations on all hands, ſurely
this, <hi>this is the Houre of Temptation, you had need pray hard, that
you may not be led into temptation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Good men are apt to be ſecure, becauſe you are Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of the Feild, and are entring into your much deſired
Canaan;<note place="margin">Numb. 25.</note> but conſider that when the people of Iſrael were
upon the very borders of Canaan, and all their Enemies
were not able to overthrow them, they did, by cloſing
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:113506:22"/>
with temptations, and giving way to their corruptions,
overthrow themſelves.</p>
            <p>3. The points in agitation are points of high concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
points that have been ſtudied, and much perplexed
by great Scholers, and wittie men on both ſides; <hi>Be not too
pleaſant,</hi> though much of this week be ſpent already, yet if
you be not very circumſpect, nay <hi>if you do not beg counſell of
the Lord, you may undo three Kingdoms this week in three dayes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. <hi>When we mingled tears in Private Faſts,</hi> we had a ſweet
experience of Gods mercy; your fidelitie and reſolution
even then when you were <hi>at loweſt,</hi> and it will be your wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and your Honour, to walk humbly and cloſely with
God when you are <hi>at higheſt,</hi> that God may bring upon you
all the good that he hath promiſed to them that <hi>rule with
God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hoſ. 11. 12.</note> 
               <hi>and are faithfull with the moſt Holy, and all his Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. <hi>There are ſins with you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Miniſtri non debent ex Ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>giſtratibus po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulo ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

them in a mixed Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>6. There are ſome propoſals to be made to you, which
are not fit to be divulged when they are firſt preſented.</p>
            <p>But I am not worthy to adviſe a Parliament, the motion
is humbly preſented; and though it be rejected with ſmiles,
<hi>I intend not to appeal from you to the people:</hi> but give me leave in
my Maſters Name to preſent the Peoples Appeal to You:
Conſider the cries, and out-cries of the godly part of this
Kingdom for a Reformation, they ſpeak plain, and tell
you, that,</p>
            <p>1. They have faſted, prayed, wept, for a Reformation.</p>
            <p>2. They have exhauſted their Treaſures, many of them,</p>
            <p>3. Adventured their lives, loſt their limbs, their blood,
their friends, for a Reformation.</p>
            <p>4. You have promiſed us a Reformation.</p>
            <p>5. And we have payd for a Reformation. And,</p>
            <p>6. You are therefore in debt to us for a Reformation.</p>
            <p>7. We are bold to chalenge ſuch a Reformation as will
quit the coſt, and anſwer the price which we have payd,
and the pains we have beſtowed.</p>
            <p>8. We deſire ſuch a Reformation as that we may not be
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:113506:22"/>
forced to make a Separation, <hi>that is the language of ſome that
are ſerious and peaceable Saints;</hi> and therfore it is the more to
be conſidered.</p>
            <p>9. <hi>By the help of a thorough-Reformation, there may be a thorough-Reconciliation
amongſt all that are prudent, pious, and charitable:</hi>
all who mind the ſame things, purity and peace, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to walk by the ſame rule in faith and love, <hi>A thorough-Reformation
would make us all friends;</hi> for ſome of our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
tell us, that they know not whether or no they can
<hi>cloſe with us,</hi> till they ſee <hi>what Reformation will be allowed us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are diviſions enough already, and I have many
things to propoſe which may unite all that are judicious
Chriſtians, nothing that may divide them, we all deſire
<hi>that the ordinances of Chriſt may be purely adminiſtred, that all
ſcandals that threaten us may be prevented, and all that diſquiet
or pollute us may be removed:</hi> we all deſire to walk in the way
of Jehovah, as it is in my Text.</p>
            <p>1. In the way of faith, our God is a jealous God, and he
is jealous in point of faith, as well as worſhip; <hi>The leaſt Iota
of divine truth is more precious then Heaven and Earth:</hi> I bleſſe

            <p>2. We muſt walk in the ſame way of Worſhip: I ſhall
not here diſcourſe of Naturall or Civill helps which may
ſome way further us in the worſhip of God; it is clear that
the Members of every Congregation reſpectively are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to <hi>an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity in reſpect of time and place;</hi> they muſt
agree to meet at the ſame time in the ſame place, to joyn
together in acts of Divine Worſhip. The Lords day is not
a bare circumſtance, there is an Inſtitution for it, and a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall

me nearer to God, and God to me; nay to commend my

is more kindly taken upon that day, then upon any

Lords day:</hi> we are all obliged to a <hi>Chriſtian <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi> in this

to the Command of the Lord of the day. Moreover, God
is a jealous God, and will not allow of <hi>Superſtition, Idolatry,
or profaneneſſe,</hi> and therefore we are bound up to an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:113506:24"/>
in point of worſhip. The Libellatici of old were
(as ſome conceive) in fee with the State, that they might
not be forced to worſhip Idols, though they held too much
correſpondence with Idolaters: but <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſervants,
though once Idolaters, had no ſuch diſpenſation, they

walk in the way of Jehovah: and I hope we ſhall have no
Libellatici amongſt us, men in fee with the State that they
may worſhip Idols. On the other ſide, I do not know that
there is any humane Set-form of prayer like to be impoſed
upon the Miniſtry of this Kingdom, and yet there ought
to be a firm and uniform agreement amongſt us about the
ſubſtantials of worſhip, that we may all obſerve thoſe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
