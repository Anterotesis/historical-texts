            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S many things (most reuerend father,) are both comely and profitable; so neither is there, neither can there be anything more necessarie, in any well managed church or christian common weale, then godly vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie and christian vnitie in pure Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the proper and peculiar worship of the euerliuing God. Which vnitie and vniforme conformitie for all that, not onely the cruell and blood-thristie Papists in former times, but the Brownists also and the Martinists, (cursed broodes untimely hatched, detested of God, and irkesome to the world,) haue of late daies endeuoured with might &amp; maine, to disturbe, &amp; extinguish it, &amp; to take it quite out of the way. For the speedie conuersion, or else for the vtter confusion, of which professed enemies of the godly vnitie and true christian peace of Gods Sion, I deeme them right happie, who can in any small measure concur by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse, and put to their helping hand. Against the former sect, I haue published many books, challenging all English Iesuites, Seminaries, &amp; Iesuited Papists; yea prouoking and adiuring them all ioyntly and seuerally, to frame some an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere either to all or to some one of the saide bookes. But wil ye haue the truth? their harts faile them, their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces accuse them, they are at their wits end, &amp; know not in the world what to say or write. They will not answere,


<pb facs="tcp:1615:3"/>
and why I pray you? because forsooth they cannot, but to their owne shame and confusion euerlasting. For if they could, they would vndoubtedlie answere mee, so to saue their owne credite, and the life of their late harched Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Religion. About three yeeres agoe, a railing Iesuit, an odde swaggering Diuine terming himselfe <hi>E. O.</hi> in his detection against Maister D. <hi>Sutcliffe,</hi> and Maister <hi>Willet,</hi> taketh notice of the bookes which I haue published against them, and telleth his Readers, (if they may beleeue him,) that the confutation of my workes is vndertaken. But what followeth? (and the said confutation must be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, if it shall be thought expedient.) By which words with the circumstances annexed thervnto, wee may easily vnderstand three memorable points. First, that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists are mightilie troubled, about the answearing of my bookes. Secondly, that they can not tell in the worlde, how and in what sort to answere them. Thirdly, that they would haue all their Popish Vassalls to think, that they haue alreadie answered them; and that they are not published, because it is not thought a thing expedient to bee done. But I pray thee, gentle Reader; who will beleeue these Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits? what wise man will euer thinke that the Iesuits haue for the space of eyght or nine yeares considered howe to answere my bookes, and after the answere is vndertaken, cannot tell if it bee expedient to publishe the same? for as the Philosopher can tell them, <hi>Vltimum in executione, debet primum esse in intentione.</hi> That which is the last in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, must bee the first in intention. Yea, the very light of Nature and daylie experience teacheth vs; that in all our actions wee must chieflie and principallie respect the end, for the which wee intende to doe them. They dare not fight the combat valiantly, neyther with the long sworde,


<pb facs="tcp:1615:3"/>
nor yet with the shorte. They dare not encounter mee, and cast mee their Gauntlet, No, no, <hi>Negry quidem,</hi> can bee extorted from their pennes. Against the latter sect, because they whollie dissent from the Papists, and agree with our English Churche, in the chiefest fundamentall points of Doctrine, an other manner of methode, and a different kinde of proceeding, must bee vsed against them. They exclaime with open mouthes, and crie out against our English Church; flying from our companies, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing vs, as prophane, polluted, and forlorne people. They vse Conventicles, Whisperings, and meetings, in Woodes, Fieldes, and odde corners. They beare the simple people in hand, that our Temples are propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; our Doctrine corrupt, our Sacraments impure, our Byshops Antichristian, and our kind of Church-gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment repugnant to that sacred forme and order, which our LORD IESVS prescribed in his holie worde. They say of themselues (but <hi>Laus propriioris sordescit,)</hi> that they are inspired of the holy Spirit, that they are sent from Heauen to reforme our Church, and to direct it into all Truth. With which faire speeches, and sugred words, (alas for pittie) they seduce the rude vulgar sorte, steale away their hearts, and make them disobedient to higher powers. And while these good fellowes, (the <hi>Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists</hi> and <hi>Martinists,)</hi> seeke to bee reputed the onely wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men vpon Earth, they neither knowe what they say, nor yet whereof they affirme; but doe open a large window to all disloyaltie and sedition euery where, and giue the Papists some comforte and hope, once to enioye theyr long expected daye. In regarde hereof (most Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Father, and worthie Prelate,) my selfe (though the meanest of manie thousands in this our English


<pb facs="tcp:1615:4"/>
Churche) haue thought it <hi>operaepretium,</hi> to vse my Penne in my plaine and simple manner, for the vnitie and true peace of our English Sion. and for the manifestation of the lawfull gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t thereof. I haue in this present discourse (most honourable, constant, wise, and christian Patron, of the Churches libertie, power, freedome, &amp; auncient prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue, which the Brownists and foolish Martinists would turne vpside downe,) made euident demonstration of the lawfull gouernment of our Church. And that is done in such compendious manner, as neither the Reading can be thought tedious, nor the price of the book chargeable, with such perspicuitie, as the most simple, (euen very babes and children,) may with al facility understa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the same with such sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie, as no Brownist, or Martinist, or other malitious aduersarie of our churches godly setled gouernment who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer, shall euer be able while the world indures: either with Scriptures, Councels, Fathers, or Ecclesiastical Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, to gain say or with stand the same. I haue succinctly and euidently, set down before the eyes of the indifferent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that the monarchical gouerna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of our English church, is both the best and the most laudable of all others. That there is &amp; euer hath beene in all former ages of the church, superioritie of one church-minister aboue and ouer ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that one may this day lawfully haue iurisdiction ouer another. That Bishops, Arch-bishops, Primates, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitains, &amp; Patriarches, haue euer beene in the church: euen from the Apostles themselues. That no church-laws, canons, ordinances, or constitutions Ecclesiasticall what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer; either ought to be established, or can bee of force, strength, power, or authoritie, without the lawfull assent of the supreme ciuill magistrate. That the church hath power,


<pb facs="tcp:1615:4"/>
freedome, &amp; authoritie, to dispose of all indifferent things, to ordaine ceremonies, and Ecclesiastical rites, to appoint, make, constitute, and establish lawes, canons, ordinances, and constitutions whatsoeuer not repugnant to Gods holy word, so that it be done for any one of these three ends, <hi>vz.</hi> For order, for comlinesse, or for edification sake, that there is grauitie, decencie, modestie, and edification; as well in the apparell allotted for the Ministers and the ministerie, as in the other ceremonies of our English Church. That the gouernment of euery particular Church may be altered and changed, as the circumstances of times, places, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons shal require. That no charge is so tied to the practise of the Apostles, but for her necessitie she may alter &amp; change the same. Many other points of great moment, are handled in this compendious discourse. To which or to some part thereof, all that may be reduced with facilitie, whatsoeuer the aduersaries haue said or possibly can say, against the gouernment of our English Church. The worke such as it is, (most gratious Lord,) I humbly dedicate vnto your grace, as well to giue a signification of a thankefull minde for all your graces fauours towards me, namely, for your great liberalitie in time of my sicknesse at my last being at London, as also for your graces most Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> zeale, singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar care, &amp; painful endeuours, employed for the good and quiet of the Church; both of late dayes, about the most profitable and necessarie canons of <hi>Anno,</hi> 1604; and in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, euen euer since Church-gouernment was first imposed vpon you. For which holy vigilancie and godly care, though the Brownists, the Martinists, and other en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uious and malitious male-contents, doe both thinke and speake hardly of your grace, yet are all that loue the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good and peace of our English Church, bound in the

highest degree to bee thankfull to your Grace for the same. The Almightie preserue your Grace, confirme your God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie zeale against the disturbers of the common peace, and giue you a long and happie life vpon Earth, (for his owne glorie, and the Godlie gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Church,) and life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall in the worlde to come.</p>

                  <p>I answere, that a kingdome may be possessed two waies; <hi>viz,</hi> by election, and by succession or discent of blood roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. They that are kings the first way (as the Emperour of the <hi>Romans,</hi> the king of <hi>Polonia,</hi> and if there be any others of like sort,) if they change their gouernment into tyrannie, and violate the lawes, to which by couenant, oath, and promise, they stand obliged in their election; they <hi>(I</hi> say,) may be deposed by the same power &amp; authoritie, by which they were inuested into their throne. The reason hereof is euident; because the possession, right, and vse of their regall authoritie, is not independant &amp; absolute, but conditionall and relatiue; and consequently, such a King degenerating from his oath and promise, standeth at the curtesie of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors, concerning the interest, possession, and vse of his prerogatiue royall. But they, who are Kings by discent and succession in blood royall, (as is our most wise, pious, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and religious Soueraigne, who happily this day raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth ouer vs,) haue an absolute and independa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t soueraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ouer their subiects, which neither doth, nor euer did stand, in the curtesie, power, and pleasure of their people. For Kings by succession and discent in blood royall, are Kings <hi>Ipso facto,</hi> so soone as their auncestors are deceased, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen before the act of their annointing and Coronation, as also before the oathe; which vsually they take for the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly administration of their kingdomes.

                  <hi>Moses</hi> the first Catholique Magistrate in <hi>Israel,</hi> bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the person not of a priest which was imposed vpon <hi>Aaron,</hi> but of an higher power like vnto a Kings, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed order for all manner of Religion in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of GOD, and prescribed to <hi>Aaron</hi> himselfe and to the order of the Leuits, both what they should doe, and what they should auoide and leaue vndone. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we see euidently, that the care of ordering Religion doth more pertaine to the higher magistrate, then to the order of the Priests.

doubtlesse was the signe of Gods couenant, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth wholy to religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. In the person of <hi>Samuel,</hi> there did cohere both the Magistracie &amp; the Priesthood; but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the charge of moderating religion, not as hee was a Priest, but as hee was a Magistrate, greater then whom there was none at that time in <hi>Israel.</hi> As a magistrate, he did iudge <hi>Israel,</hi> and ordered all publique affaires, as well sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred as prophane, ecclesiastical as ciuill; but as a Priest, hee offered sacrifice, prayed for the people, and taught them.</p>
               <p>Out of these wordes of this great learned writer, I note these golden lessons for the good of the well affected Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. First, that <hi>Moses</hi> was a ciuill magistrate, hauing autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  like vnto a king. Secondly, that his power was grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then was the authoritie of <hi>Aaron</hi> the hie Priest. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  that <hi>Moses</hi> ordered all matters in religion, and not <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>  
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  who was the hie Priest. Fourthly, that he appointed to <hi>Aaron</hi> and to the whole order of the Leuites, both what  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>  they should doe, and what they should leaue vndone. Fift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the charge &amp; care of religion, doth appertaine more  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>  neerely to the magistrate, then to the order of the Priests. Sixtly, that the magistrate hath the charge and care of orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>  religion, inseparably annexed to his ciuill office, in that hee is a magistrate.  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> 
               </p>
               <p>Seuenthly, that a Bishop may haue authoritie to deale in ciuil causes, as <hi>Samuel</hi> did.

               <p>Wee reproue in like manner all those, who yeelde and giue authoritie in religion vnto Magistrates, onely in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall matters touching death, whilest they denie them au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to call Synodes to consult of religion, to reforme Churches, and to appoint out of Gods word, the things that pertaine to the saluation of their subiects: and will one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue them to bee the bare exequutors of those things, which the Bishops doe decree.</p>
               <p>Thus writeth this learned Doctor, a man of as great a iudgement, as any is in the christian world. Out of whose words I note first, that he condemneth many, who now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  thinke themselues very wise. Secondly, he auoweth  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  that magistrates haue authoritie to call Synodes. Thirdly,  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  that they haue power to deliberate of religion. Fourthly,  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>  that they haue authoritie to reforme the ministers and church-affaires.

               <p>Maister <hi>Martyr</hi> a very learned writer, discourseth at large, both of the authoritie of the minister and of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate. He sheweth most excellently, both how the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <note place="margin">

Wherefore they are farre deceiued, that are wont to exclaime and say; What hath the Preacher to doe with the Common-weale? what hath he to doe with warres? what with the Apothecaries? what with cookes? but let these good fellowes tell vs, why the Minister of Gods word, when he perceiueth Gods law to bee transgressed in these things, may not rebuke the same out of Gods word? why hee may not admonish the malefactors? why he may not exhort them to desist from sinne? it is his part doubtlesse to reproue sinners; not with the sword, not with <hi>Pecuniarie mulct,</hi> not with imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not with the sword, not with exile, but with the force &amp; power of Gods word. Then this learned man proceeds, and telleth vs, that the ciuill Magistrate must see and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide, that the Bishops, Pastors, &amp; Doctors of the Church, doe teach Gods word purely, rebuke sinners fatherly, and administer the Sacraments reuerently. After this, he telleth his Reader, that kings haue not charge onely of the bodies of their subiects, but of their soules also. For, (saith this great learned Doctor,) we must not make princes swine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards and heardmen for keepers of cattell, who haue care onely of the bellies, flesh, and skinnes of their subiects; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause kings must prouide &amp; see, that their subiects liue ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuously and in the feare of God: yea, he saith further, that if the Ministers teach not aright, or doe not administer the Sacraments orderly: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Magistrate must reduce them into order, and see that they teach sincerely, and doe not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse the Sacraments, nor deliuer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> otherwise then Christ hath commanded. And if they liue wickedly and disorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he must depose them from the Ministerie. Thus wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth this Doctor, and much more he hath to the like effect, but I studie to be briefe. <note place="margin">

                  <p>Out of these wordes of this holy Father and learned writer, I note first, that a Bishop hath an higher degree in  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  the Church, then hath a Priest or Elder. I note secondly, that this superioritie among Ministers, hath euer beene in  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>

Thirdly, that the name of a Bishop is the name of digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  &amp; honour. Fourthly, that as <hi>Aaron</hi> had a degree aboue  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>  the Priestes in the time of <hi>Moses,</hi> so haue Bishops now a degree aboue the other Ministers or Elders. Fiftly, that a  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>  Bishop onely ordeyneth Ministers.</p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Chrisostome,</hi> who liued in Saint <hi>Austines</hi> time, had very great superioritie ouer Bishops; for hee was not onely Bishop of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> but also ruled many other Churches, both in <hi>Thracia, Pontus</hi> and <hi>Asia.</hi> These are the expresse words of <hi>Theodoretus</hi> in his historie, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this matter: <hi>Atque hoc modo prospexit non illi solum ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitati,</hi>

                  <p>And <hi>Chrysostome</hi> the Bishop of <hi>(Constantinople)</hi> did by this meanes not onely prouide for that citie, but also, for all <hi>Thracia,</hi> which is diuided into sixe Bishoptickes: as also for the whole Countrey of <hi>Asia,</hi> which hath in it eleuen Bishops. He also ruled <hi>Pontus</hi> which hath the same num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Bishops with <hi>Asia,</hi> and beautified it with the same Lawes.</p>
                  <p>Out of these words of this holy Father, worthily surna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the golded mouthed Doctor; I obserue first, that hee  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  was the Arch-bishop of <hi>Constantinople.</hi> Secondly, that hee  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  had also iurisdiction Archiepiscopall, ouer 28. Bishops; in <hi>Thracia, Asia,</hi> and <hi>Pontus.</hi> And that the Reader may fully know what iurisdiction this holy Father vsed ouer these Churches; two things must be remembred, which are set downe in the place quoted in my Margent. The one, that he commaunded the Priests to liue after the Lawes. The other, that he did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ptiue them of their Priestly function, which did violate and transgresse the lawes. So then it is cleare and euident, that there are degrees of superioritie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Ministers; yea, that one Bishop hath iurisdiction

The same <hi>Ignatius,</hi> in that Epistle which he wrote to the Church of <hi>Trallis</hi> in <hi>Asia</hi> hath these words: <hi>Quid est. n.

For the order of Bishops is the begetter of the Fathers: for that order begetteth Fathers to the Church. But the order of Priests is not of abilitie to beget the Fathers: but it beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth sonnes to the Church by the regeneration of Baptisme: yet not Fathers or Doctors. This auncient Father liued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue 12. hundred yeares agoe, at which time it was holden for a grosse errour generally, to say, affirme, or thinke, that <note place="margin">A. <hi>D.</hi> 372.</note> a Priest was equall to a Bishop, in degree, dignitie, or iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction.</p>
                  <p>This reason which S. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> maketh touching the begetting of Fathers to the Church, is invincible, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer can be answered. It is the very same in substance with that of S. <hi>Hieromes,</hi> which I haue set downe alreadly: <hi>viz.</hi> that a Bishop differeth from a Pastorall Elder, by the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of ordaining and making Ministers. And, to proue the superioritie of a Bishop aboue a Priest, or Pastorall El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: that which <hi>Saint Austin</hi> telleth vs of <hi>Aerius,</hi> is a flat and euident demonstration. For <hi>Aerius</hi> being a Priest, sought by all meanes to bee a Bishop, and was sorie that hee could not attaine and accomplish his desire. For greife whereof, hee opposed himselfe against the prudent and godly setled order of the Church: affirming very desperately as Saint <hi>Epiphanius</hi> saith, that a Priest was

                  <p>That euery prouince had an Arch-bishop among their Bishops, and that the Councell of <hi>Nice</hi> did appoint Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arches, which should be in order and dignitie aboue Arch-bishops, it was done for the preseruation of discipline. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in this discourse wee may not forget that it was a thing of very rare vse. For this cause therefore were those degrees especially appointed, that if any thing should hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in any particular church, which could not there be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided, the same might be referred to a general Synod. If the greatnesse or difficultie of the cause, required yet greater consultation; then were added Patriarches together with the Synodes, from whom there could be no appeale, but onely vnto a Generall Councell. This kinde of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment some called a Hierarchie, a name improper and not vsed in the Scriptures, as I thinke. For the holy Ghost would not haue vs to dreame of any dominion or rule, when question is made of Church gouernment. But omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the name, if we consider the thing it selfe; we shall find, that these old Bishops would not frame any other kind of gouernment in the Church, then that which God prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in his word.</p>
                  <p>Thus writeth Maister <hi>Caluin</hi> of the antiquitie of degrees and superioritie, amongst the Ministers of the Church. Which whosoeuer shall ponder seriously, (all partialitie set apart, (together with the constitutions, testimonie, and approbation of the most sacred and renowned generall Councel of <hi>Nice</hi> (which Councel was euer to this day high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reuerenced throughout the Christian world;) that man doubtlesse, cannot but approoue and allowe our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Arch-bishops with their names and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, this day established in the godly setled gouernment of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> For first, Maister <hi>Caluin</hi> graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth willingly, the truth it self plainly leading him thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,)  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  that in the time of the famous Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi>

there were both Arch-bishops and Patriarches. Secondly, that y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> patriarches were in order &amp; dignitie aboue the Arch-bishops;  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  and consequently, that there was euen then, <hi>(viz.</hi> aboue one thousand two hundred and fortie yeares agoe,) superioritie Episcopall, Archiepiscopall, and Patriarchall, among the ministers of the Church, one minister hauing iurisdiction ouer and vpon an other.

This is a point of great moment, which may not bee forgotten. To which <hi>I</hi> also adde, (which the Reader must obserue seriously with mee,) that the Councell of <hi>Nice</hi> telleth vs plainely, that this superioritie of one Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster aboue and ouer an other, (which the Brownists can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure,) was not then first appointed, but had beene time out of minde by an auncient custome of the church, which the Councell confirmed and established by her decree. But how doe I proue it? doubtlesse, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse wordes of the Councell.</p>
                  <p>For the Councell in the sixt Cannon, hath these <note place="margin">

                  <p>Now we see by the perpetuall obseruation of churches, euen from the Apostles themselues; that it pleased the holy Ghost, that among the ministers to whom especially the gouernment of the church is committed, one should haue the chiefe care, both of the churches and the whole sacred ministery; &amp; that he in that care and sollicitued, should be aboue al the rest; for which cause, the name of Bishop is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly giuen to such chiefe gouernours of churches.

Hence comes it, that my selfe neither will, nor with safe consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence dare, reproue such kinde of decrees. But what is more cleare and euident, by Histories, by Councels. and by the writings of all the Fathers, then y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> those orders of Ministers, (wherof we haue spoken:) haue bene appointed &amp; receiued in the Church, euen with the common consent of the whole christian Common weale?

to this day? as who knew (right well) that both the Church might lawfully doe these things, &amp; also that they proceeded of pietie, &amp; that all things were ordained to very godly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, for edefication of Gods elect. Thus writeth this lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, godly, zealous, and iudicious Father: who for his rare learning, profound knowledge, pure zeale, &amp; great iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, was inferior to none of his age in <hi>Christs</hi> Church, if not superiour to all. Out of whose words I obserue many more excellent &amp; worthy docume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, for the help of the wel affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Reader. First, that this godly learned man was fully  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  resolued to die in that Faith, which he heare speaketh of. Secondly, that he published this his Confession of Faith,  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  with a good conscience, constantly beleeuing as he wrote. Thirdly, that his Faith was grounded vppon the word of  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  God. Fourthly, that the Decrees of the holy Fathers as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>  in <hi>Christes</hi> name, defined by the common consent of all, and not repugnant to the Scriptures, were not sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Decrees of men, but also of the holy Ghost. Fiftly,  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>  that the Degrees of Ministers, and superioritie of Bishops Arch-bishops, Primates, and Patriarches, were approued and receiued by vniforme and common consent, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Church of <hi>Christ.</hi> Sixtly, that this great  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>  learned man neither durst, nor could with good conscience reproue the same. Seuenthly, that the Church had au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>  to appoint, constitute &amp; ordaine, such degrees and superiority amongst the Ministers of the Church. Eightly,  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/>  that such constitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s proceeded of pietie, &amp; were ordeined for edisicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Church.

Out of which wordes, I note two things, both memorable and of great importance: wishing the gentle Reader, to marke them attentiuely. First, that  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  the auncient Fathers haue decreed according to the holy Scriptures, superioritie, among Ministers in the Church, and the degrees of Bishops, Arch-bishops, Primates, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitans, Suffragans, and Patriarches. Secondly, that  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  this learned Doctor thinketh himselfe bound in consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to acknowledge, receiue, and obey such decrees and constitutions of the holy Fathers: and therefore earnestly desireth to ende his life in that beliefe.</p>

                     <p>We may not thinke, that Christ doth altogether forbid, that no christian shall be called father, or maister, or Lord; as if it were vnlawfull for children to call him father, that did beget them; or for Schollers to call him Maister who teacheth them; or for Seruants to call their Maisters Lords; seeing the holy Scripture commaundeth children to honour their Parents, and the Apostle also willeth Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants to obey their Maisters, and when hee heard the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Prison call him, and <hi>Silas</hi> Maisters he did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke him for the same; but so to bee called Father and Maister, as the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharises</hi> were called, hee vtterly forbiddeth in this place. First, they greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to bee called <hi>Rabbi,</hi> and therefore the affection of such names is forbidden. Againe, they wished so to be called <hi>Rabbi,</hi> that GODS people should wholy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend vpon them, and in no respect denie or withstand their ordinances and Decrees. But to bee called Father or Maister in this sort and manner, agreeth to no mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall man.</p>
                     <p>For there is one onely true Father, which is GOD


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:1615:22"/>
himselfe, and one onely true Maister, which is Christ, vpon whose commaundements wee must so depend, that wee may in no case sweare to the wordes of any other man. Heere wee are sufficiently taught, in what sense Christ for bad his Disciples to bee called <hi>Rabbi,</hi> and Maisters, <hi>viz.</hi> As I saide, against the ambition of Primacie, and desire to rule, are these things spoken, (and not simply against Rule, Dominion, or Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oritie.) For otherwise, hee would haue saide; let none amongst you, bee greater then the rest. But nowe, when hee saith, hee that is the greatest of you, shall bee your Seruant, hee sheweth himselfe not to have saide, yee are all brethren, for that hee woulde haue them in all things to bee equall among themselues, but that they who excelled others in the gifts of GOD, might humble themselues to the seruice of others. Thus writeth this great learned Father, out of whose golden wordes, wee may gather euidently sundry necessarie documents, for a resolute and full aunswere to the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent obiection. For first, hee affirmeth constantly, that Christ doth not simply prohibite Christians to bee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  
                        <hi>Rabbies</hi> or Maisters, but so as the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rises</hi> desired to bee called Maisters. Secondly, hee tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs, that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> were well pleased to bee  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  called Maisters. Thirdly, hee auoucheth roundly, that CHRIST did not forbid Dominion, Rule, and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perioritie,  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  but onely ambition and greedie desire of bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring rule ouer others. Which his opinion, hee proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth to bee grounded vpon Christs owne wordes. And doubtlesse, it is to bee admired, that any Learned <note place="margin">

For the Bishop of <hi>Romes</hi> superioritie, is so farre from heing moderate and lawfull: that it may truely be termed tyrannicall, and plaine diabolical. Because (as I haue proved at large in other discourses,) hee taketh vpon him to depose kings, to translate kingdomes, and in most brutish and savage manner, to tyrannize ouer mens soules and consciences, <hi>Idque iure divino,</hi> as hee beareth the world in hand.</p>

Secondly, that the very names are so farre from being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane and disholy; that the most zealovs Patrons of the Presbitery, doe allowe and approue the same for lawfull and holy, and to haue beene ordained of the holy Fathers for a godly end and purpose.

                     <p>That the twelue Apostles had one among them to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne the rest, it was no maruell.

doth reside.) Wherefore we haue decreed, according to the auncient Law of our Fathers, both that he shal excel in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and also that all the other Bishops shall doe nothing at all without him, sauing those things onely, which apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to their owne diocesse and possessions. Thus decree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this auncient and famous Councell, out of which doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, I obserue these worthy lessons. First, that an Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop or Metropolitan had in old time, the charge of the  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  whole prouince. And consequently, that our Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Metropolitans in the <hi>English</hi> church, haue no new Ministerie, nor other authoritie; then was had and practis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the holy Fathers in auncient time, euen in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue church. Secondly, that this authoritie of an Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  to rule a whole prouince, was not first constituted by this Councel, (though it were of very great antiquitie,) but was receiued by an auncient rule from their forefathers. Thirdly, that all the Bishops of the prouince, must bee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by the Metropolitan or Arch-bishop. Fourthly  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  that the other Bishops could doe nothing, without the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>  of the Arch-bishop; such things onely excepted, as pertained to their owne diocesse and possessions. Let thus much be graunted to our Bishops, (which good reason will affoord them,) and they will desire no more. But, because the testimonie of the best Patrons of the presbyterie, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but prevaile much in this controuersie, let vs heare the verdicts, of the chiefest Doctors herein. Maister <hi>Caluins</hi> testimonie is already knowne, touching the authoritie of Arch-bishops in forrein countries, but I wil alledge and set before the Readers eyes, his plaine testimonie for our Bishops heere in <hi>England.</hi> These are his owne wordes, in his Epistle to Arch-bishop <hi>Cranmer.

The same <hi>Caluin</hi> in his Epistle to Doctor <hi>Grindall</hi> the Bishop of <hi>London</hi> hath these wordes; <hi>Quod tamen cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram popularium nostrorum qui in praecipua episcopatus tui vrbe habitant, suscipere dignatus es, non solu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>m vt libertas illis daretur reginae beneficio dei purè invocandi, sed vt pastorem fidum hinc accerserent, nisi hac de causa me tibi obstrictum faterer, stullitiae &amp; inhumaintatis essem damnandus.</hi> Yet that you haue vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed to take care of our vulgar country-men, which reside in the chiefe citie of your bishopricke, not onely that by the Queenes fauour they might haue freedome to serue God aright, but that also they might call from hence a faithfull pastor; if I should not confesse my selfe bound vnto you herein, I might iustly bee condemned both of follie, and of nhumanitie.</p>
                        <p>Out of these wordes, I obserue these corollaries.

Which good to bee procured by that meanes, rather then by any other imployment besides; it may appeare both by experience, and practise. By experience, for that wee see those Kingdomes, Princes, and people, most blessed of God, where learned and godly Bishops haue beene recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued into the Princes Counsell.

for First, in the lawe of nature, <hi>Melchisedech</hi> was both King and Priest.

               <p>Secondly, in the Lawe of <hi>Moses, Moses</hi> himselfe  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  was both the ciuill Magistrate and a Priest. For <hi>Moses</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Heli</hi> was both the high Priest, and iudge of the people, for the space of 40 yeares together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Samuel</hi> likewise was both a Priest and iudge ouer the people, for the space of 30. yeares together. The good king <hi>Iosaphat</hi> made the Priests iudges, both in ecclesiastical and ciuil causes. And after the captiuitie of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> the <hi>Machabees,</hi> were rulers, aswel in ciuil as in ecclesiastical cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. Read the books of the <hi>Machabees, Iosephus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Egesippus.</hi> and this truth will soone appeare. But what neede many words, in a case so cleere and euident? God himselfe made a general law, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the priests &amp; the ciuil magistrate shuld iont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly determine, iudge and decide, all controuersies. These are


<pb n="45" facs="tcp:1615:27"/>
the expresse wordes of the Law; if there rise a matter too <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, in the Gospell, and newe Testament, wee <note place="margin">In lege gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae.</note> haue a pluralitie of examples in this behalfe. S. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he made his abode at <hi>Corinthus,</hi> with <hi>Aquila,</hi> and <hi>Prescilla,</hi> whom <hi>Claudius</hi> the Emperour had driuen from <hi>Rome:</hi> he <note place="margin">

               <p>S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> thought it a thing so lawfull, for a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop to be iudge in causes Ecclesiasticall; that I wonder, how any man hearing or reading his owne words, can any longer stand in doubt thereof. Thus doth he write: <hi>Quis</hi>

               <p>Who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruite thereof? who seedeth a flocke, and receiueth not of the milke of the flocke? Yet I call the Lord <hi>Iesus</hi> to witnesse vpon my soule, in whose name I boldly vtter these words: that touching mine owne commoditie, <hi>I</hi> had much rather euery day to worke some thing with mine hands, as it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in well gouerned Monasteries, and to haue the houres free, to read, and to pray, and to doe some exercise in the holy Scriptures: then to suffer the tumultuous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities of other mens causes touching secular affaires, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in determining the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by iudging, or in cutting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> off by intreating: to which molestations the Apostle hath tyed vs, not by his own iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but by his iudgement who spake in him; which troubles for al that himself did not vndergoe, because his course apostolicall had an other respect. Which labour notwithstanding we endure with consolation in the Lord, for the hope of eternall life, that we may bring forth fruit with patience, for we are seruants of the Church, and especially to the weaker members, how mean members so euer we are in the same bodie. I let passe innumerable o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ecclesiasticall cares, which perhaps none will beleeue, but he that hath tryed the same. We therfore doe not binde grieuous burdens together, and impose them on your shoulders, which we doe not touch with our finger: seeing we had rather do those things which we exhort you to do, then which we our selues are compelled to doe; if we could so doe with the discharge of our dutie, as knoweth God the searcher of our hearts. Thus discourseth this holy, aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and most learned Father. Out of whose doctrine, I obserue many golden, worthy, and very necessarie docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,


<pb n="47" facs="tcp:1615:28"/>
for the instruction of all indifferent Readers. First,  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  that he delt much in secular causes and affaires of the world. Secondly, that he had rather haue wrought with his hands,  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  and haue done much bodily labour in the monasterie; then to haue beene so tossed and turmoyled, in hearing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining ciuill causes of his people.

Let this point be well marked, because it is of great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Fourthly, that the Apostle had bound him so to  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>  deale in secular affaires. Fiftly, that the Apostle did not  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>  impose that secular charge vpon him, by his owne iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and authoritie: but by the counsell and iudgement of God himselfe, who spake in him.

Sixtly, that S. <hi>Austin</hi> did vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>  the molestations of secular businesse, because hee hoped thereby to attaine eternall life. Seuenthly, that hee  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>  could not doe his bounden dutie, vnlesse hee were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times occupied in deciding ciuill causes. So farre was this holy Father from their opinion, who more rashly then wisely, affirme it a damnable thing, and an Antichristian marke, for a Bishop to be a Iustice of <hi>Peace,</hi> or of <hi>Quorum:</hi> and yet cannot any learned writer be named, for the space of a thousand and two hundred yeares, who reputed not S. <hi>Austin</hi> for a very holy man, and a most graue &amp; learned writer. Let all such persons therefore consider better of the matter, and either wilfully condemne that holy Father, and mighty pillar of Christes Church; or else let them henceforth be more sparing of such savage loquacitie, and approue the Christian and laudable offices of Iustice of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Quorum,</hi> in the reuerend Fathers, the Lord Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of the English Church.

               <p>Neuerthelesse, wee doe not denie, that Bishops which are also Princes, may besides their authoritie eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall, haue also politicall right and secular power, like as other Princes haue: right to commaund secular matters; authoritie to vse the sword; authoritie to choose and confirme Kinges and Emperours, &amp; to constitute and administrate, other ciuill affaires, as also to compell their subiects to yeelde obedience to them in that behalfe. And therefore wee graunt, that their subiects must obey their civill commandes, which may be kept without offence of Gods law: and that not onely for feare, but also for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science sake.</p>

               <p>And who cannot see it euidently proued, by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples which I haue alledged, that they must bee obeyed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, whether they be by right, or no right created Princes. For why shall not subiects obey in things not against Christian pietie, the Princes of the Empire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing also Arch-bishops, of <hi>Moguntia, Colen,</hi> and <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers?</hi> it is doubtlesse the properietie of sedicious persons, not to yeelde obedience vnto them.

Thus writeth the famous and great learned Doctor <hi>Zan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius.</hi> Out of whose resolution, I obserue these points, for the good of the gentle Reader.</p>
               <p>First, that Ecclesiasticall and Civill iurisdiction are  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  compatible, and may both be in one and the same subiect at once.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that Bishops which are also Princes, may  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  together with their Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction, haue also se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular power, and authoritie to vse the sword, and such like.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that the people within their dominions  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  and liberties, are bound to obey them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that they must obey not onely for feare, but  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>  euen for conscience-sake.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, that whosoeuer shall disobey such Bishops  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>  and Arch-bishops, doe shewe themselues thereby to be seditious fellowes. To which I adde, that this doctine of this great learned man, (who was a most zealous

professour of Christes Gospell) doth flatly confound, and euen strike dead, pronouncing a sharpe <hi>vae vobis</hi> to all such, as shall obstinately refuse to obey our Bishops and Arch-byshops here in <hi>England.</hi> For whatsoeuer can be obiected against our Bishops, why wee shall not obey them: the same may be alledged against those Bishops, of which <hi>Zanchius</hi> speaketh in this place. Yea our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, are as lawfully created Barons, and doe this day as lawfully enioy their temporall Baronries (for ought I know,) by the free donation of the Kings of this Realme of famous memorie, as doe the Bishops of <hi>Germanie.</hi> I therefore conclude, from a good foundation surely layd, that Bishops and Arch-bishops, aswell concerning their names and titles, as their authoritie, iurisdiction, and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perioritie ouer other Ministers, are both lawfull, necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and agreeable to the practise of the Catholique Church in all Ages: and consequently, that none will or can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie the same, but such as are either wholy ignorant, in the auncient Councels, holy Fathers, and ecclesiasticall hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories: <note place="margin">

                  <p>There bee some traditions, which may bee termed uentrall or indifferent, for that they neither are against Gods word, neither doe they necessarily cohere with it. In which ceremonies, the Churches constitution must bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed, if three cautions doe concurre. First, that they bee  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  not obtruded, as Gods worship, or peculiar holinesse; but as pertaining to order and the ciuill commoditie of the Church, and to comlinesse in divine actions: otherwise all things are sufficiently comprised in the holy Scriptures, which pertaine to holinesse and gods worship. Secondly,  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  we must beware, that they be not reputed so necessarie, that they cannot be chaunged, as the time requireth. Let the Church keepe her interest and libertie in these indifferent things, to appoint what shall be thought most necessarie to the edifying of the faithfull. Lastly, let it bee well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred,  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  that the multitude of Ceremonies doth often so an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy the people, that they are almost vndone therewith.</p>

                  <p>Because the multitude is for the most part ignorant and intractable, and the greater part doth often times prevaile against the better; all things are not euen in a popular state lawfully appointed, committed to the vnbridled multitude, but certain Magistrates are appointed by the peoples con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, to guide, rule, and gouerne them. If this wisedome be required in wordly affaires, much more is a moderation to be had in those matters: in which men are altogether blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Neither is there any cause, why any man of sound iudgement shall exclaime, that in such matters, there is no place for pollicie; except hee can shewe this pollicie whereof I speake, to be repugnant to the word of GOD, which I am perswaded he can never doe. For we must not simply looke, what the Apostles did in ecclesiasticall polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and Church-gouernment, seeing there is so great varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of circumstances, that a man cannot without preposte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous zeale, reduce all things in all places and times to one <note place="margin">

                  <p>Out of these words, I note first, that the Church is not  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  so strictly bound to the practise of the Apostles, that she must alwayes follow the same in these <hi>Adiaphorôis</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  that the Church in things indifferent, hath <note place="margin">The authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Church is very great.</note> power to make any Lawes, which are not repugnant to the word of God.

                  <p>It is avident, that our Lord <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> hath prescribed to vs in his word, the substance onely of the Ministerie, both of the word, and of the Sacraments; and hath permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Church to order all other things, concerning the decent and profitable administration of his mysteries. Wherevpon we celebrate the holy supper, neither at night, neither in private houses, neither sitting downe at the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, nor with men onely, but touching the time, place, and habite of the bodie, either for celebrating or for receiuing the Holy supper: touching the admission of women vnto the Communion of the sacred Supper, and the manner of singing and praising God: touching apparrel also, &amp; other things pertaining to externall comelinesse: I doubt not, but our Lord hath giuen free power to his Church, to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and dispose of those things, as euery Church shall iudge it to bee most profitable for her people, to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and increase reuerence toward all the holy mysteries of God. If therefore any Churches, vppon this libertie graunted by Christ, and for this ende of edifying <hi>Christes</hi> people, would haue their Ministers to vse in time of the holy Misteries, some speciall kinde of apparell: all su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition, levitie, &amp; dissention or abuse being taken away: doubtles. <hi>I</hi> see not, how any man ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> iustly condemne such a church of any sin in that behalfe, much lesse of communion with Antichrist. What if any Church with a pure and

holy consent of her children had such a custome, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one should vse a white vesture in time of the holy Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, as the newly baptized ought in olde to doe? for, if any will contend, that y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> libertie may not be granted to <hi>Christes</hi> Church, hee must doubtlesse confesse one of these: either that the Church hath no authoritie at all, to ordeine any thing touching the Lords Supper, whereof they haue not the expresse commandement of <hi>Christ,</hi> and so all Churches shall be condemned of impious audacitie, for all Churches obserue in the celebration of the holy Supper, both the time and place, and the attire of the body, and doe withall admit women to the holy Communion. Touching all the which, they haue not only no commandement of the Lord, but haue also a contrary example, for our Lord celebrated his Supper at night, not in the morning; in a private house, not in a publike place; sitting at the table with his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, and eating the <hi>Paschall,</hi> not standing; and so exibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the holy Communion. Yea, the women were exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, whom he reputed among his most holy seruantes. Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that it can not be, that there bee any Churches, which our Lord doth so free from all suspition and the abusing of his good creatures, that to the pure all the creatures of God be good through right faith in his name, and pure in the vse of signification; which whosoeuer shall say, hee doubtlesse must therevpon denie that <hi>Christ</hi> our Lord is the deliuerer of all men from all vncleannesse, as hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to be. Either that the wicked can by their abuse so pollute the creatures of God, which are good of their owne nature, that no godly man can vse them to a godly ende; which saying is euidently, against the testimonie of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost. Or <hi>certes,</hi> that Christians can not lawfully dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of all creatures, to put them in minde of their maker, and of our selues, and of his benefits toward vs, and of our duties toward him: which maketh against that, which the holy Ghost teacheth euery where, for the acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and worship of God in all his works, and for the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Thirdly, that God himselfe hath taught this to  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  be so, at two seuerall times in two distinct subiects.

The ignorance whereof, hath brought many into many grosse errors. <hi>I</hi> therefore note heere by the way, for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the well affected and thankfull Reader, that the Lawe of <hi>Moses</hi> was threefold. <hi>viz.</hi> ceremoniall, iudiciall, and morall; whereof the morall part doth this day onely remaine in force with vs Christians, as which is indeed the very Lawe of nature, imprinted in euery mans heart in his natiuitie, and so cannot be altered or changed.

Touching the number of witnesses, the Lawe of nature is silent, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth that point as <hi>Arbitrarie</hi> to the of man. Hence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth it. Secondly, that blasphemers, adulterers, &amp; such like  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  malefactors, are this day suffered to liue in many Christian kingdomes, and that thing is permitted, without any tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression of Gods lawe in that behalfe, For the Lawe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth onely require this, <hi>viz.</hi> that sinne be so punished, as standeth best with the peaceable gouernment of the common-weale. Touching the quantitie and kind of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, it saith nothing at all. Hence commeth it.

It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore most prudently and right Christianly prouided in the Cannos of <hi>Anno.</hi> 1604. that none shall bee permitted to Preach without Licence. Hence commeth it. Fourthly, that the true owners may for good causes and considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>  lawfully sell their landes and inheritance, and others lawfully buy the same, howsoeuer some without all testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of Scriptures, Councels, or Fathers, doe perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily Preach against the same.

it fiftly, that Fathers may giue their lands lawfully to any of their children; either to the yongest, or to any of the rest,  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>  or to the Church, Hospitals, kinstolkes, or meere stran, gers, so it be done for good respects, and godly considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the Law of nature requireth no more of Parents, concerning Goods, lands, and possessions, but this onely thing; that they bring vp all their children in true faith, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly feare, and humble obedience, and prouide competently for their honest mainteinance and sustentation. If any shal hold the contrarie, hee will giue occasion to set all the land together by the eares, Hence co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth it Sixtly that sundry  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>  customes in this land; <hi>viz.</hi> where brethren inherite toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as sisters at the common lawe, and the youngest sonne before the eldest, are not vnlawfull, the like may be saide of many other points in the iudiciall Lawe, and to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent obiection. For the naturall part of this iudiciall Lawe, doth onely require this of vs: <hi>viz.</hi> that we keepe our selues from Idolatry, and from doing any honour or worship to the same. Maister <hi>Caluin</hi> doth not dissent from this mine exposition, concerning the text alledged in the obiection.

Loe, this precept was onely giuen to the Iewish people, and endured but for that time; and so, as it is iudicial, it doth not this day touch vs that be Christians at all.</p>

The same liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and freedome is granted to the Church, in the Election of her Ministers.

                  <head>The first Reason drawne from the practise of Christ and his Apostles.</head>
                  <p>CHrist himselfe, as his holy Gospell teacheth vs, did of <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. <hi>Uerse.</hi> 1. <hi>Luke.</hi> 10. <hi>Uerse.</hi> 1.</note> himselfe alone without the consent and voices of his people, both call and choose his Apostles. And in like manner, himselfe alone did cal &amp; choose his disciples, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he sent abroad to Preach the Gospell, into euery citie and place, whither he himself should come. But most certain it is, that we are bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to imitate Christs facts &amp; deeds, before all other mens. For euery his action, is and ought to be our instruction. For this cause doth the Apostle exhort the <hi>E:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. <hi>Uers.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>phesians</hi> and in them all other Christians, to be followers of God, as deare children. And the same Apostle willeth vs to be followers of him, euen as he followed Christ.</p>
                  <p>The Apostles themselues in their Elections of ministers, did not euer obserue one and the same manner. For, in one <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 26.</note> place we reade, that they presented two, <hi>Barsabas</hi> &amp; <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias</hi> whereof the one was chosen by <hi>Lot.</hi> In an other place, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 3.</note> we find that this course was altered. For the people presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted seuen to the Apostles, who all were chosen without <hi>Lots,</hi> &amp; vpon whom the Apostles also laid on their hands. Wee reade in an other place, that this forme was like wise <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 14. <hi>V.</hi> 23.</note> changed, and that the Apostles <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> ordained ministers in euery citie, in which ordaination they neither obserued casting of Lots, nor yet any presentment by the <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 2. <hi>tom.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 5.</note> people. We find in an other place, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> Elected and ordained both <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and gaue them authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to ordaine others. Hereupon I inferre this euident con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, that there is no certaine forme prescribed for the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of ministers, which is to be obserued for euer in the Church, but that euery Church is free to change the same, according to the circumstances of times, places, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.

so to doe, because the whole church hath chosen them there vnto; which by Gods word hath power and commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, to choose the ministers of the Church.

Secondly, that the church hath this libertie and  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  power granted to her; either to choose them her self by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral voices of all, or else to appoint some special persons for that ende and purpose. Thirdly, that the manner of elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  church-ministers may be chaunged, as the circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of times, persons, or places shall require. Fourthly, that  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>  this varietie of election, is grounded vpon Gods word. Fift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>  that <hi>Paul, Bernabas, Titus,</hi> and <hi>Timotheus,</hi> did of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues choose the ministers of the church; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the manner of electing church-ministers this day v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the church of <hi>England,</hi> is agreeable to the word of God, and also to the Apostolique practise of the Primitiue church. For our Bishops doe not exercise any authoritie at all, saue that onely, which the whole church assembled in Parliament, did by vniforme assent committed vnto them.</p>

                     <p>I answere; First, that S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> meaneth nothing else by diuine authoritie, but divine examples; not any divine  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  precept, commanding it so to be done, <hi>Uiz.</hi> that there are examples in the Scripture, by which wee may learne, that the common people were present at the election of the Ministers, to giue testimonie to the church of their life and conuersation; as witnesses of their honest behauiour, not

                     <p>Of the second kinde are the matter of the signes, and the forme of certaine Rites which our Lord ordained; as for examples sake, bread and wine, are the signes of the Supper, by our Lords owne institution. Where therefore there is either no vse at all of bread and wine, or else great want for a time, shall we celebrate no Supper of the Lord? Yea, it shall bee celebrated aright, if that bee taken in the place of bread and wine, which either by common vse, or in regard of the time, is vsed in the stead of bread or wine. For this <hi>Christ</hi> intended, when he chose bread and wine for these mysteries; that by proposing before our eyes, the signes of those things with which our bodies is nourished, he might represent the true foode of our soules. Therefore he swarueth not at all from <hi>Christes</hi> meaning, who hauing no desire of innovation, vseth in stead of bread and wine, those things, which though they haue not equall, yet haue they like proportion of nourishment with bread and wine. There wants also water, and yet Baptisme neither ought nor can be differed with edification; my selfe doubtlesse

                     <p>Out of this doctrine thus deliuered by these two lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Doctors, <hi>M. Calvin,</hi> and <hi>M. Beza I</hi> observe these most important documents. First, that the authoritie of  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  the church is so great, that it can alter the matter of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, both of Baptisme and the Lordes supper, if credit may be giuen to these great Doctors doctrine</p>
                     <p>Secondly, that the vse of the Lords Supper and of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  is of such necessitie, that this chaunge may and ought to be admitted, rather then wee bee defrauded of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite thereof.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, that neither the practise of the Apostles, nor  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  the examples of <hi>Christ,</hi> nor yet <hi>Christes</hi> owne institution: No, not in the matter of Sacraments, is of such force and moment; but that the church vpon good and necessarie cause, may alter and chaunge the same. And consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it must needes be graunted, neither can it with any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of reason bee denied; that the Church may chaunge the maner of choosing her ministers, as necessarie circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of times, places, and persons shall require.

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  that though Arch-bishops, and Metropolitans were not expressely named, yet were they equivalently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in the Apostles. Thirdly, that as the Church for a  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  time wanted Arch-bishops and Bishops, so did it also want Deacons and vnpriested Elders. And as the defect of the latter, did not argue the imperfection of the Church for that time; so neither did the want of the former, inferre any such necessarie consequence. Fourthly, that as the Church  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>  had authoritie, for the circumstances of times, places, and persons, to ordaine Deacons, and vnpriested Seniours, (if any such euer were,) so also had it then, and this day hath like authoritie to ordaine Arch-bishops, and other Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters <note place="margin">

                  <p>Touching all other ceremonies, which were vsed of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient time in the holy misteries, or are this day in vse with many; as fire to Exorcismes and Catechismos, the white garment of the Baptized, holy bread giuen to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techumenes, and many other things, my opinion is this, if there were any Churches, which retained pure doctrine and sincere discipline, and did vse these signes and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies simplely and purely, without all superstition or le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie, precisely to godly admonitions well vnderstood of all the people; <hi>I</hi> verily could not condemne those church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, for the vse of such signes or ceremonies. Hence it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that as men doe in priuate and publique actions, so also may they adde many signes vnto their holy ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and that not without profit. The signe also of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of hands, was giuen by Bishops onely, and that <note place="margin">Note well this point and doctrine, dels. uered by this great lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man.</note> not without reason. For whether the baptized were to bee confirmed with the couenant of the Lord, or they, who had sinned grieuously, were to be reconciled, or Ministers were to be ordained vnto Churches, all these ministeries doe especially partaine vnto them, to whom the chiefest charge of the church is committed.</p>

Out of these golden wordes of this great learned Doctor, and renowned Writer, I obserue these worthy lessons. First, that in the auncient approued Churches were many  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  Ministeries, with which inferiour Ministers (then called Priests, as our Church this day vseth the same names,) had not to doe withall. Secondly, that onely Bishops (who  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  were superiours in degree,) could make, order, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate Priests, and other inferiour Ministers of the Church. Thirdly, that onely Bishops, and not Priests, did confirme  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  the baptized, by imposition of hands. Which thing our <hi>English</hi> Church doth this day lawdably obserue, howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer some mal-contents, more rashly then wisely impugne the same. Fourthly, that the Church hath authoritie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute symbols, signes and ceremonies, and to adde them  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>  vnto the holy misteries. Fiftly, that we may not condemne  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>  those Churches, which for godly considerations without superstition, doe vse such signes and ceremonies, as were not knowne or heard of in the primitiue Church. Oh that this doctrine were well marked, and remembred; for then doubtlesse all dissention would cease, and all mal-contents would yeeld obedience, to the godly settled Lawes of our <hi>English</hi> Church.</p>
                  <p>Maister <hi>Zuinglius</hi> a very learned and famous Writer, and a most zealous professor of Christs Gospell, is able to <note place="margin">

These are his expresse wordes: <hi>Simul &amp; illud notari debet, quod apostolorum nomen deposuerunt, vt primùm vni alicui ecclesiae affixi, illius curam continuam habuerant, cum nimirum vel senecta impediti, vel morbis afflicti, peregrinationum molestijs &amp; periculis amplius, sufficere non potuerunt.

                  </p>
                  <p>This also must be marked, that they laid away the name of Apostles, so soone as they were tyed to any one church, and had the continuall charge thereof. To wit, when they being either hindered with old age, or afflicted with disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, were no longer able to endure troubles and molestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of trauaile. For then they were no longer called Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, but Bishops. We may bring Saint <hi>Iames</hi> the yonger, for an example, or rather for a witnesse of this matter. For <hi>Hierome</hi> and all the auncient Fathers, call him the Bishop of <hi>Hierusalem;</hi> and for no other cause, saue onely that he had placed himselfe in that citie. For when in former times, hee as the rest of the Apostles, being giuen to peregrination, had taught the faith euery where, the Apostles made him, as a diligent watchman, the Bishop of <hi>Hierusalem.</hi> The same we may say of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the Euangelist, and disciple of Christ. For when he being exposed to many dangers, had executed the apostolicall function a long time, hee was at length made the Bishop of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and died 68, yeares after our Lords ascension.</p>
                  <p>Out of these words of this excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t discourse, I note first,  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  that in the Apostles something was extraordinarie and temporarie, and something likewise ordinarie and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall. This is an obseruation of great moment, well wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be engrauen in Marble, with a Penne of Gold. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  that the Apostles were some time Bishops, and that their function in that respect was perpetuall. Thirdly, that  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  so soone as they betooke themselues to an ordinarie cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, <note place="margin">Note this point wel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>We reade in no place of the holy Scripture, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles weare baptized; saue onely, that mention is made of two in S. <hi>Iohn.</hi> Where for all that, the same is not plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expressed, but obscurely infinuated. If therefore wee shall follow your manner, and denie all things, which are not conteyned in the holy scriptures; then <hi>certes,</hi> we shall bee compelled to graunt, that neither the blessed Virgin <hi>Marie,</hi> nor the Apostles them selues were euer baptized; which doubtlesse is a strange assertion, and farre from all pietie and religion.

Our Lord neither appointed, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned this kinde of worship; therfore it can neither please, nor bee acceptable to him. But touching ceremonies, the

case is farre different. For wee may not say; there is no mention made of these Ceremonies in the Scripture, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apostles vsed them not; which thing is prooued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly, by the example of the blessed Virgin, and of the Apostles. Out of this must excellent discourse, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue these worthy documents. First, that all things neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  for our saluation, are comprised in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Secondly, that many other things necessarie for  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  Church-gouernment, are receiued by tradition. Thirdly,  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  that it is not a good Argument, to reason after this manner; there is no me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion of these things in the Scriptures, therfore the Apostles vsed them not, or therefore they are not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.

To these two texts, which are of one and the same effect, for the establishing of the presbyterie, I answere in this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner; First, that the Apostle in both places may be vnderstood  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  indifferently, either of ciuill gouernours and gouernment onely, or of ecclesiasticall onely, or of both ioyntly, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, that the text cannot be racked so, that it must perforce be vnderstood, of the vnpriested Seniors of the Presbyterie, especially, seeing it may as fitly, if not more truly, be vnderstood of Kings. Monarches, and other ciuill christian Magistrates; to whom the chiefe care and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight appertaineth, of all persons and causes within their kingdomes, territories, and dominions. Secondly, that the  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  original Greek word <hi>(Cubernesejs)</hi> signifieth gouernments, not gouernours. So that thereupon cannot be inferred ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily, any distinct gouernor from the afore-named A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, prophets, and Doctors. For diuers offices may bee and often are, coincident in one and the same officer. And for this respect, when the Apostle commeth to the repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Marke this point well.</note> of his former assertions, and should by order haue men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned the gift of gouernance; he passeth it ouer in silence, albeit he reckoneth vp the other seuerally. Wherby hee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs to vnderstand, that hee containeth the same, either in all, or in some one of the former offices or gifts. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  that none of the holy Fathers in their Commentaries, did euer gather out of these texts or the like, any vnprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Seniors. Fourthly, that both maister <hi>Caluin,</hi> maister  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>  
                     <hi>Bucer,</hi> and maister <hi>Martyr,</hi> doe extend these places to all kinde of gouernment. The fourth text is taken from the <note place="margin">

But <hi>I</hi> answere, that the Apostle vnderstandeth by Elders, such as are ministers of the word, or else of the Sacraments. <hi>I</hi> proue it first, because  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> Saint <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> and Saint <hi>Ambrose,</hi> yea and maister <hi>Caluin</hi> himselfe, (where hee speaketh purpose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Seniors,) doe so vnderstand the word (Elders.)

For by the word (labour,) Saint <hi>Paul</hi> vnderstandeth no ordinarie, vulgar, and meane exercise; but an extraordinarie, vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and most painfull labour; such as <hi>Timothie, Titus, Luke, Marke,</hi> and others, were well acquainted withall. Thirdly, because the Apostle, if hee had meant that some  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  Elders did neither preach, nor administer the Sacraments, would haue added, which labour in the word and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the Sacraments, for it had been as easily said, as, which labour in the word and doctrine; but, because there were some, that laboured onely in the word and doctrine, and other some likewise, who laboured in administring the Sacraments; hee saide <hi>(Coptôntes)</hi> which labour painfully, to distinguish them from such as laboured in the same kind and office, though not in so laborious and painefull maner.</p>

                  <p>THe constitution of the earnestly wished, and long expected English presbyterie, doth ouerthrowe it selfe, and can no way be defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded. I proue it first, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  diaconesses or widowes are no lesse required in the holy scripture, then are Deacons; neither are the one <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.</note> more extraordinarie or temporarie, then are the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And consequently, the frame or building of the presbyterie is not perfect, seeing it consisteth onely of these foure; Pastors, Teachers, Elders, Deacons. And to answere as some doe, that there must bee godly poore widowes when they can bee gotten, is not to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. For if Gods appointment and order may bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in widowes, because sit women cannot bee got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; euen so may wee excuse, the want of their ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vpriested Seniors, as also the want of their Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Ministers. For the necessitie and want of sit per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  is equall in them all. I proue it. Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Pastors and Doctors or Teachers are not distinct officers, but are taken in holy <hi>Writ</hi> for one and the same. For Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hauing seuered Apostles, Prophets, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelists, <note place="margin">

                  <p>Euery man seeth, that these wordes are confounded, and that one of them is taken for an other. For an Apostle is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so a Prophet, a Doctor, an Euangelist, a Priest, and a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop. And a Bishop is an Euangelist and a Prophet.

Therefore the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> by these diuers names signifieth those di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers gifts, which our Lord bestowed on his Church vnto saluation.

and aduise the gentle Reader, to reade my answere againe, and againe, and to ponder it seriously, before hee giue his iudgement therein. My answere standeth thus, First, that <hi>Ieroboams</hi> hand was dried vp, and <hi>Saul</hi> deposed  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  from his royall throne; not, for that they challenged a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigntie aboue the Priests, and supreame authoritie in causes ecclesiastical; but, because they attempted arrogantly and presumptiously, to execute priestly functio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in offering incense vpon the Altar, burnt offerings, &amp; peace offerings. Secondly, that <hi>Vzziah</hi> or <hi>Ozias</hi> was smitten with the lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  because hee would needes burne incense to the Lord, which was the Priests proper function. Neither did the Priests for all that thrust him out of the Temple, but duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, (as it become them,) told him what was his dutie, and that he had offended God; and therefore they willed him to surcease from his wicked enterprise, and to goe foorth of the sanctuarie. Which was no other vsage, then S. <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist afforded <hi>Herode</hi> the Tetrach; when he told him, it was not lawfull for him, to haue his brothers wife.

                           <hi>Mat.</hi> 14. <hi>Vers.</hi> 4. 3</note> that the fact of <hi>Iehosaphat,</hi> proueth euidently the Kings supreame power ouer all his subiects, as well in causes ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall, as ciuill.

For, albeit in the preaching of the word &amp; administratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Sacraments, the chosen minister hath onely the charge and authoritie to execute them; neuerthelesse, Gods annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Prince hath the supreame charge &amp; souereigne authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to command the execution thereof; as also to correct and to punish the Minister, for the neglect of his dutie in that behalfe. Of which point <hi>I</hi> haue spoken sufficiently in my other bookes, and therefore deeme it a thing needlesse now to stand long vpon the same. Fourthly, touching the fact of <hi>Iehoiada</hi> the Priest, I answere, that it can no way, proue the superioritie of Priests ouer kings. For first, <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoiada</hi>  
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  was not a priuate man, but the high Priest in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  did nothing against <hi>Athalia</hi> of himselfe, but with the aduise, assent, and helpe, of the Centurions and Peeres of the Realme; all which were bound by the lawe of <hi>Deutero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomie,</hi> to defend the kingdome from strangers. Thirdly, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Dent.</hi> 17. <hi>v.</hi> 15.</note> 
                        <hi>Iehoiada</hi> was bound by the right of affinitie; to defend king <hi>Ioas,</hi> and to establish him in his Kingdome. For his wife  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  was the kings Aunt. Fourthly, God had assured by his  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>  infallible promise, the Kingdome to the familie of <hi>Dauid.</hi> Now <hi>Athalia</hi> was not of the stocke and Progenie of <hi>David,</hi> but a stranger to the Kingdome. For her mother was a <hi>Sydonian,</hi> and her father an <hi>Israelite,</hi> more addicted to ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie, then were the Gentiles. Besides this, the wicked pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensed Queene <hi>Athalia,</hi> had traiterously murdered and wholy extinguished, all the lawfull royall blood, (the yong childe king <hi>Ioas</hi> onely excepted, whom God contrarie to her knowledge, had miraculously preserued,) and withall shee had set vp the worship of <hi>Baal.</hi> Wherefore, it was the parts of the Priests and Peeres of the Kingdome, to protect the King, to defend his royall right, to suppresse the vsurped power of <hi>Athalia,</hi> and to deliuer the King,


<pb n="140" facs="tcp:1615:75"/>

So then, albeit the Ministerie of feeding, of Preaching Gods word, and of the administration of his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, pertaine onely to his ministers, neither may the meere ciuill magistrate in any wise intermedle therewith; yet for al that, most true it is, that the prouision for the food, the ouer sight that the children of God be duly fed, and that the ministers doe exercise their functio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in vigilant &amp; duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full manner, belongeth to the ciuil independant, and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute princes. For this respect is it, that Kings and Queenes <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Esa</hi> 49. <hi>Vers.</hi> 23.</note> haue the names of nurses, not for that they nourish their children in ciuil matters onely, but as in ciuil, so also in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, that is to say, <hi>in lacte verbi dei,</hi> in the milke of the word of God. For though the execution pertaine to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters yet the prouision, direction, appointment, care, and ouer-sight, (which is the supreame gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t indeed,) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth onely, soly, and wholy to the prince.

other reformed Churches, but teach plainly and Christian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that euery Church hath freedome, libertie, and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to make such canons, orders, ordinances, and constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as shall bee thought most meete, fit, and conuenient, for the external gouernment thereof. Which thing I haue already proued; not onely by the practise of the Church in all ages, but also by the vniforme assent and constant ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, of best approoued Patrons of the reformed Churches in this age. Secondly, that those great Patrons of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  Churches, who deeme vnpriested Elders to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for their particular precincts, free cities, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weales, doe for all that thinke an other gouernment more fit for Christian Monarchies, and doe highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the same.

                     <p>First, it is the dutie of the ciuil magistrate, to constitute the ministers of the church, where they be wanting; whether he choose the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> himselfe, or confirme those which others by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment haue chosen. For it is not meete, that any mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster execute any function in the Church, without the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the publique Magistrate. You will say; But it was otherwise in the Primitiue Church, where the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and the people did choose their Gouernours. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere; the state of the Church was then such, that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters


<pb n="143" facs="tcp:1615:76"/>
of the Church could not be chosen otherwise, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause then they were destitute of a Christian Magistrate. If thou wilt vse the manners of that time, thou must first call againe the condition and state of that time.</p>
                     <p>Out of these words, I note many golden obseruations. First, that the ciuill Magistrate may appoint and elect the  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  ministers of the Church. Secondly, that none can lawfully  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  execute any Church-foundation, or bee a Minister of the Church, without election, assent, authoritie, or confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ciuil magistrate. Thirdly, that the ciuil magistrate  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  may either choose the ministers himselfe, or appoint o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to doe it. Fourthly, that the gouernment of the church  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>  may be altered, according to the circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stances of times, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces &amp; persons. Fiftly, that the English long expected pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterie,  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>  can not stand with our English Christian Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie. For, she challengeth that as her proper office, which as <hi>Musculus</hi> truly saith,) doth properly pertaine to the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill Christian Magistrate.</p>
                     <p>I say thirdly, that it cannot be concluded out of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Tertiò prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipaliter.</note> Scriptures, that any annuall vnpriested Elders, had the rule of the Church with the Pastors and Bishops.  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I</hi> say fourthly, that for want of Christian Princes, laicall  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>  Elders may be assumed to the Church-gouernment, to help and assist the pastors. Yea, <hi>I</hi> further graunt, that the said El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders may remaine vnder a christian prince so it be with his assent, good pleasure, and moderation. But <hi>I</hi> constantly denie, that such kind of gouernment must of necessitie bee had, in and vnder a Christian Monarchie.</p>

                        <p>I answere; first, that S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> did not thinke those Elders, of whom hee speaketh, to be necessarie for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church. I prooue it, because hee being a most learned, zealous, and godly Arch-bishop, would for his zeale and pietie haue laboured to restore them: and could for his great authoritie, haue effected the same. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  that Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> speaketh of Elders in yeares, not of Elders in Office: that is, of wise, graue, and olde men of great experience, whom the Bishops in former times tooke in counsell with them, as did also the auncient Synagogue. Our Church-wardens in this age, doe in some sort resemble them.</p>
                        <p>It something grieued holy <hi>Ambrose,</hi> that graue men, auncient in yeares, whom the Apostle would not haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued roughly, did not remaine in like esteeme with the pastors of the Church, as they were of old. This is the true meaning and sense of S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> concerning those Elders he speaketh of. I prooue it out of <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> his owne wordes, which are these: <hi>Nam apud omnes vti<expan>
                                 <am>

For which cause, both the Synagogue of old, and the Church afterward, had alwayes certaine old men, without whose aduise nothing was done in the Church. Loe, he speaketh of honouring Elders and auncient men, in regard of their yeares. But he neuer meant to equalize them with those, who were Elders in calling, and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Churches vnder him. No, no: the blessed man <hi>Ambrose,</hi> that graue and holy Bishop of <hi>Millan,</hi> neuer drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med or once conceiued in minde, that any order of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie, set downe by Christes Apostles, was worne out of vse in his time.</p>

                           <hi>Gualter. in</hi> I. <hi>cor.</hi> II.</note> ascribeth vnto Princes. These are his wordes; The <hi>Donatists</hi> of our time ought to consider these things more diligently, which doe ouer rashly condemne whole Cities,

and Countries, where the word of God is preached, the sacraments rightly administred publique praier celebrated, the poore sufficiently prouided for, and vices, by good and godly lawes for bidden and punished. All these things they esteem as nothing, except there be a certaine new magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie appointed, which should haue authoritie ouer Princes also. The same learned writer in another place, discourseth in this manner: There be sundry that will needes institute <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Gualter. in</hi> 1. <hi>Cor. ca.</hi> 12.</note> Elders, or an ecclesiasticall Senate, according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Primitiue Church, which also should haue au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie ouer the Magistrates themselues, if at any time they did not their dutie. But it behooueth them first, to shew, that those their Seniours haue this power, whereof <hi>Paul</hi> doth presently speake: which thing seeing it doth by no meanes appeare, and yet they deliuer vnto Satan whome they will; they doe like, as if some would goe about to cleanse the leaprous, raise the dead, and worke other mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, because these things were vsually done in the primitiue Church. The same learned Doctor in another place wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth thus: Their ambition is reproued, which goe about to <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Gualter. in</hi> 1. <hi>Cor</hi> 14.</note> bring all Churches to the forme of their discipline and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, &amp; cry out that there is no discipline there, where all things are not agreeable to their traditions and orders. But these me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> receiue a iust reward of their arrogancy, when they that come fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them to other countries, goe beyond all men in fancinesse, &amp; bring nothing from home, but a vaine and intollerable contempt of all good men, neither can they abide to be corrected by any admonition of others.</p>
                     <p>The zealous, godly, and learned Doctor <hi>Musculus,</hi> hath these expresse words. We thinke otherwise then they, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Musculus in locis, de magistr. Pag.</hi> 631.</note> who denie to Christian Magistrates, authoritie to make ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall Lawes. We boldly affirme, that all power of making authenticall Lawes, which binde the conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the subiects, whether they be ciuill or ecclesiasticall: doe neither pertaine to the multitude of the faithfull, nor to the Ministers of Gods word, but properly to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate


<pb n="147" facs="tcp:1615:78"/>
onely, to whom more power is giuen ouer his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biects. Wherevpon they are called in the Scripture, Gods, who doe execute the Magistracie: which name of honour, we doe not reade that it was giuen vnto the Priestes. The very reason and nature of gouerning can not suffer, that there be 2. authentique powers in one people, two diuers law-makings and dominions, vnlesse it be by subordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; euen as there is no place, for two heads in one body.</p>
                     <p>The same <hi>Musculus</hi> in another place, hath these golden <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Vbi suprà, Pag.</hi> 630.</note> wordes: but we without dissimulation thinke thus. Like as the Christian Prince hath chiefe power &amp; care in religion, so hath he also power to constitute and make ecclesiasticall lawes, &amp; to reforme abuses in religion. The very nature of making lawes doth not suffer, that they command &amp; make Lawes, who haue not power to defend the Lawes, and to take punishment of the transgressors: and that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate should protect the lawes, and punish the offendors, who shal not haue power to make the lawes, which he doth defend. But <hi>Certes,</hi> among men he that hath power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, hath also power to take reuenge. I know it apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to the magistrate, to punish not onely the transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors of his owne commandements, but also of Gods. But the case is altered, if the question be made of lawes ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall, neither divulged by God immediately, neither yet by his Apostles, but by men within the ministerie of the Church. Here doubtlesse it is not sit, that they which are of meaner authoritie, shall make Lawes: and they who are of higher power, must see them kept. Men of meaner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, may cause lawes to be obserued: but superiours onely can make lawes, whose authoritie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelleth to obey them, and who haue power giuen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God, to punish the diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient. While therefore they ascribe the constitution and promulgation of ecclesiasticall lawes to those, whom they call gouernours of the church, (to wit, the presbyterie,) and leaue only to the magistrate, power to see them kept, and to punish the offenders: what other thing do they, but giues


<pb n="148" facs="tcp:1615:79"/>
that to inferiours being subiects, which of right belongeth to higher powers; and taketh it away from superiours, to whom euery soule must be subiect. And so they peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ordinance of God make of subiects Lawe-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, and of Law-makers subiects. Thus writeth this lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man.</p>
                     <p>Out of these learned discourses of these two most lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and famous Writers, I note these worthy documents. First, that vnder most Christian Princes, where the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterie  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  beareth no sway; the word of God is soundly prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, the Sacraments rightly administred, publique prayer duly celebrated, the poore sufficiently relieued, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces sharply punished. Secondly, that all these things will not content the maisters of the Presbyterie, vnlesse they  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  may haue Princes at their commaund. Thirdly, that if the Patrons of the Presbyterie, will needes haue all things af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  the manner of the Primitiue Church; then must they cleanse the leaprous, raise the dead, &amp; worke miracles as the Apostles did. Fourthly, that the authors of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie,  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>  are arrogant, contentious, froward, and saucie fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes. <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Bazilycon Doron. Pag</hi> 42.</note> To which the Doctrine of our gracious soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne in his <hi>Bazilycon Doron,</hi> is right consonant; when he telleth vs very grauely, (besides many other vices which  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>  he there reckeneth vp,) that we shall neuer finde with any Hic-land, or border-theeues, greater ingratitude, and moe lyes and vile periuries, then with this kinde of people. Fiftly, that they denie vnto Princes, authoritie to make ecclesiasticall lawes. Sixtly, that not the Presbyterie, but  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>  the ciuill magistrates, kings, Emperours, Monarches, and other independant superiours, haue power to make canons and ordinances ecclesiasticall. Seuenthly, that whiles they  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>  assigne vnto princes, onely the execution of their Lawes; they make of inferiours, superiours; and of subiects, Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers: and so peruert the holy ordinance of God.</p>

                     <head>The Answere.</head>
                     <p>I answere; First, that the Church in the Apostles time  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  was most perfect indeed, concerning faith and doctrine absolutely; as also touching external gouernment, if regard be duly had vnto that time. Secondly, that there was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  in the Apostolicall time, one and the same externall gouernment of the Church, as is alreadie proued. Thirdly,  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  that the externall pollicie of the Church, may admit altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and change without all preiudice of faith and consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; according to the circumstances, of times, places, and persons. And consequently, that Christian Princes enioy this day very lawfully and laudably, the chiefe care and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame ouer-sight thereof. Men of best account in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, doe in plaine tearmes approue and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme this my doctrine.

But the condition is farre otherwise in those Churches, which by the benefit

of God haue christian Princes and Magistrates, in whom resteth authoritie, power, law-making, and gouernance, not onely in prophane, but in holy things also.

                     <p>Out of these most excellent and golden discourses of these great learned men, who were very famous and highly renowned in the best reformed churches. I gather these memorable obseruations. First, that the Church is not fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  or tied, to any one setled kind of gouernment, but may be changed in her gouernance, as the circumstances of times, places, and persons shall require. Secondly, that it is  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  very fit and conuenient, sometimes to alter the gouernment of the church. Thirdly, that the church may not bee gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  now: as it was in those daies, when there were no chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian magistrates. Fourthly, that wee must not respect so  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>  much what the Apostles did, as their intent and purpose, the scope and marke which they aimed at.</p>

Out of which three seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall commissions of our Lord Iesus, I gather and conceiue two generall rules and settled lawes. The one, that onely <note place="margin">

I say (touching the vse and execution thereof,) because it is one thing, to execute ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, and the keyes of heauen; an other thing, to commit the execution thereof to others. The other, that <note place="margin">

This my resolution I <note place="margin">Two things must be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</note> will proue to be grounded vpon the doctrine of great lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, highly renowned in the reformed Churches, two things I haue to proue; first, that the whole Church hath power to commit the keyes and exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication, to some certaine fit persons chosen for that end and purpose. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that onely the Ministers of the word &amp; Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, can denounce the sentence and put the same in execution. Concerning the former, Maister <hi>Bullinger</hi> hath a long and learned discourse, which is able to satisfie any indifferent Reader.

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:1615:82"/>
this power to certain men chose<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for that end, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out doubt, they doe not offend against Gods word. But they obiect, if he shal not heare you, tel it to the church. Now some chose<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men are not the church. But these men perceiue not, that Christ &amp; his Apo. vsed the figure <hi>Synecdoche.</hi> For <hi>Paul</hi> saith you being gathered with my spirit.

If they wil stand vpon Christs words (lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally) we wil see when they wil bring the whole church to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. But we speake, (say they,) of the particular Church. We therfore haue the victory, who say that Christ vsed the figure <hi>Synecdoche.</hi> We graunt, that this power is giuen to the whole Church, but we call the congregation of good men the Church. For it followeth forthwith, in the very words of our lord; where two or three are gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in my name, there am <hi>I</hi> in the mids of them. Therfore, if Christ, as they graunt, committed the ecclesiasticall disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline to a particular church, &amp; two or three, &amp; much more eight or twelue, make a particular church: what letteth, that christ co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted not the same to chosen men, who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrate to Christs name? seeing the authoritie of ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call discipline, is more intiere &amp; renowned among chosen godly men, then among the confused vulgar sort, who as they lack iudgement, so are they often carried away with affections. <hi>Haec Bullingerus.</hi>

                  <p>Out of these most learned discourses of these graue Writer, I obserue these memorable lessons for the benefit  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  of the reader. First, that the power to excommunicate, is giuen to the whole Church. Secondly, that the Church hath  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  power to commit the same to others, as it shall be thought


<pb n="157" facs="tcp:1615:83"/>
meete for her good. Thirdly, that the Church for auoiding of confusion, did euer commit this iurisdiction, to some spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  persons fit for the same. Fourthly, that the common  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>  vulgar sort want iudgement, and are often carried away with affections, and so are vnfit persons to retaine such iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction in their hands. Fiftly, that excommunication is  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>  not any assentiall part of the Church. Sixtly, that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>  and chiefe power of disposing and committing, resteth principally in the Christian Magistrate, where the church receiueth such a blessing. And thus much of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part; <hi>viz.</hi> of the power of the whole Church. Let vs proceede to the latter part; <hi>viz,</hi> to whom the church hath committed this power.</p>
                  <p>Concerning this Latter member, it is to be holden for an vndoubted truth, and most Catholique doctrine; that none saue onely lawfull Ministers of Gods word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, can lawfully denounce the sentence of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication. For this cause was it, that when our Lord Iesus gaue this authoritie to his whole church; he gaue it alwaies <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. <hi>Mat:</hi> 18. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 20.</note> in the name, either of all, or of some one of his Apostles. And for the same cause was it, that the Church hath euer since committed the same, vnto her lawfull Bishops and Ministers of the word. The practise of the Church is most cleere and apparant, both by the councels, and by the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme verdict of the holy fathers.</p>

Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  that hospitalitie is required in a Minister, euen as is his preaching and aptnesse to conuince. And yet many pastors are allowed within the presbyterie, which for all that can keepe no hospitalitie. Thirdly, that by Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> canons  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  he is as vnlawfull a Pastor that is an angry Minister, as he that cannot Preach.

For since euery man tooke vpon him to Preach at his owne pleasure, and was permitted to doe it when and where he would; lawfull authoritie hath binso impugned, new-sangled conceits so vsuall, vnsound doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; the text it self either scantly touched or so rawly &amp; vnclerkly handled; that the auditors were as igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the true meaning of the text in the end, as in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the sermon.

                  <p>The reading of learned Homilies in the Church, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by vnpreaching Ministers, (so termed scornfully) are vehemently impugned, by the patrons of the long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected presbyterie. To whom I answere; first, that father <hi>Lati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>r</hi> that blessed Martyr, compiled a whole booke of


<pb n="167" facs="tcp:1615:88"/>
godly and learned Sermons, (my selfe haue seene the same) which hee would neuer haue done, if hee had thought it a thing vnlawfull, to read or pronounce his Sermons in the Pulpit. The like may be said of Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> Saint <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose,</hi> and many others, whose Sermons are this day extant in print, in the greater part of Europe. Secondly, that the distinct reading, of one of the godly and learned sermons  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  or homilies, setforth to be read in our English Churches, is able to edifie, and no doubt doth edifie the congregation more; then doe many of their sermons, who inueigh most bitterly against vnpreaching ministers. But these men are therefore enemies to reading, because they are carried away with a vaine <hi>Philantia,</hi> and loue nothing better, then to heare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues talking. For which end they wander abroad many times, leauing their owne charges either distitute, or onely supplied by vnpreaching Ministers, whom other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they condemne. And this they effect with desire, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in those places, where their presence is neither necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, nor yet much desired. I speake not this, either in defence of vnpreaching ministers, (for <hi>I</hi> wish with all my hart, that euery church in England, were furnished with a godly lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned preacher) or in dislike of their zeale, who endeuoure themselues to preach often; so that be done with <hi>eutaxia,</hi> &amp; obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of higher powers, &amp; with such reuerence, ripenes, &amp; due preparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as appertaineth to that heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly exercise. Thirdly, that one of the homilies or sermons aforenamed,  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  pronounced by an vnpreaching minister, (as they odiously tearme him,) is intrinsecally and formally a sermon, or a preaching, &amp; consequently, that he is truly said to preach, who publikely and orderly pronounceth the same, <hi>I</hi> proue it, because to be vttered with a shrill or meane voyce, with this or that gesture, vpon the booke or without the booke, and other like circumstances, are all and euery of them mere accidentall and extrinsecall to a Sermon, Whosoeuer shal hold the contrary opinion, must perforce admit grosse absurdities, flat contradictions, and plaine impossibilities.


<pb n="168" facs="tcp:1615:89"/>
Fourthly, if an vnlearned Minister shall receiue a learned Sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, learnedly &amp; orderly pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned by his learned friend, &amp; shall cunne the same without the booke, and after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsall of his text, shall pronounce the same distinctly and orderly in the Pulpit; all the learned that heare him, and know not the truth of the matter, will say, (and that truly) that he made a learned Sermon, although he were but <hi>cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus comatus, in rei veritate.</hi> And euen so say <hi>I;</hi> that he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth in the Pulpit, who readeth Homilies penned to his hand. Howsoeuer that be; this is out of doubt; that many reading the Homilies doe more edifie the congregation, then many others that preach their owne collections, (I will not say inuentions and fansies,) and thinke themselues no fooles. It is likewise out of doubt, that the same Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters doe preach <hi>Theologica,</hi> though not <hi>theolagicè;</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, that is acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plished by them, which is principally <note place="margin">

Secondly, the Apocrypha may true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and lawfully beecalled holie Scripture <hi>Analogicè,</hi> though <note place="margin">Analogice no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aute<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnivocè.</note> not <hi>Univocè;</hi> that is to say, the wrytings of holy men, or bookes conteyning holie and good matter. And in this sense speaketh the Rubrick, as I iudge; and sundry of the holie Fathers, I am well assured, doe so tearme the bookes Apocryphall. Howsoeuer the Rubricke be expounded, or wrested, two things are apparant. Th' one, that the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricke doth not call them Canonicall scripture. Th' other, that the Church meaneth not to equalize them, with the Canonicall books of holy writ. I prooue it, because shee hath plainely distinguished the one from the other, and preferred the authoritie of the Canonicall. Neyther will it serue their turne to say, as some haue done; <hi>viz.</hi> That nothing may be read in the Church, but onely the Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call scriptures. For first, no text of holy writ doth so af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme; <note place="margin">1.</note> and consequently, the Church hath power to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine thereof, as is alreadie prooued. Secondlie, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <note place="margin">2.</note> councell of <hi>Uasco,</hi> (which was holden aboue one <note place="margin">

By these words, (say they) the Minister is caused to testifie of God, that hee hath done that which hee neuer did.

Then doubtlesse may I say truely; that it is a mere pestilent mischiefe, when the gouernment of all the Churches in a whole Monarchy; must be squared and measured by the fancie and conceyte of euery priuate man.

                  <p>Saint <hi>Hylarie</hi> hath these words: <hi>Non ille necessitatem ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buit abluendi sed per illum in aquis ablutionis nostrae erat sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficanda purgatio. Sequitur. Atque ita &amp; Prophetae testimonio</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Hee stoode in no neede of washing; but in the waters of our washing, hee was to sanctifie our purgation. And so both by the testimonie of the Prophet, hee needeth no washing: and by the authoritie of his example, hee doth consummate the Sacraments of Mans saluation, sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Man both in his assumption, and in his washing.</p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> is consonant to the rest, and deliuereth his minde in these words: <hi>Baptizatus est ergo Dominus, non mundaeri volens, sed mundare aquas, vt ablutae per carnem</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>Our Lord therefore was baptized, not desiring to bee purged, but to cleanse the waters, that they beeing washed by the flesh of Christ, which knew no sinne, might enioy the right of baptisme.</p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> hath these words: <hi>Ipse Dominus noster Iesus Christus. qui non tam mundatus est in lauacro, quam la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uacro suo vniuersas aquas mundauit, statim vt caput extulit de fluento spiritum sanctum accepit, non quod vnquam sine spiritis</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Our Lord Iesus Christ, who rather cleansed all wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters by his washing, then receiued any cleansing, came no


<pb n="175" facs="tcp:1615:92"/>
sooner out of the floud, but hee receiued the Holy Ghost: not that hee was any time without the Holy Ghost, who was conceyued by the Holy Ghost in the fleshe: but that wee should vnderstand that to be true baptisme, in which the Holy ghost is giuen.</p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Bede,</hi> (who for his great vertue and rare learning was surnamed <hi>Venerablis,</hi> Venerable or Reuerend,) hath <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Beda in Luc cap.</hi> 3.</note> these expresse words; <hi>Baptizatus est Dominus, non ipse aquis mundari, sed ipsas mundare cupiens aquas, quae ablutae per car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem eius peccati vtique nesciam, Baptismi ius iuduerent, &amp; quod tam innumera sub lege baptismata non poterant, contra prauaricationis malum vim regeneratiua sanctificationis coni ciperent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our Lord was baptized, not for desire to cleanse him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, but to cleanse the waters, that they being washed by his flesh which knewe no sinne, might put vpon them the right of baptisme, and receiue the power of regeneratiue sanctification against the euill of preuarication, which all the washings vnder the Law could not performe. Thus write the holie Fathers. For the better vnderstanding of whose words, three things must be seriously obserued, touching the sanctification they speak of; <hi>viz.</hi> The time, the manner, and the ende. The time when they were san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, the manner how they were sanctified, and the end for which they were sanctified.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the time, wee must knowe, that Christ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted holie Baptisme two wayes. First, exemplarilie by fact; then expressely by word. Examplarilie, when hee was baptized in <hi>Iordan,</hi> about three yeeres &amp; a halfe afore his Passion, at what time hee was about 30. yeeres of age. <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Matt.</hi> 3. 13.</note> Expressely, after his Resurrection, about thirtie dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Ascention vp into Heauen. At which time Christ gaue commission to his Apostles, that they should teache <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19</note> and baptize all Nations.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the manner, hee did not instill any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent sanctimonie or holinesse into the waters, but onely


<pb n="176" facs="tcp:1615:93"/>
did consecrate and depute them vnto an holie ende; <hi>viz.</hi> To be the fit and ordinarie matter of holy baptisme; like as God is saide to haue sanctified and blessed the seuenth <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 11.</note> day, not by putting any holy inherent qualitie into it, but by deputing and ordeyning it to his owne seruice and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worshippe. Now, that he ordained exemplarilie both the water of <hi>Iordan,</hi> and all others, to bee the vsuall matter of the Sacrament of Baptisme; it may appeare by manie circumstances of the Text, aswell for the matter of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, as for the forme and effect thereof. First, hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined water to be the matter of baptisme, when he tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched <note place="margin">1.</note> it with his owne most pure &amp; holy flesh, and yeelded to be Baptized therewith. Secondly, hee determined the forme of Baptisme, when in his Baptisme the whole Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie <note place="margin">2.</note> appeared sensiblie; for, the voyce of the Father was heard from Heauen; the Sonne was present in our flesh <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 13. 16. 17.</note> assumpted; and the Holy Ghost appeered in the shape of a Doue. And (as Saint <hi>Hylarie</hi> saith,) the effect of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme was declared, for that the Heauens were opened in the celebration thereof.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the ende, Baptisme is affirmed of Christ himselfe, to bee our second byrth. In another place it is <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Act.</hi> 22. <hi>v.</hi> 17. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Rom</hi> 6. 4. <hi>Chrysosto. in cap.</hi> 3. <hi>mat. hom.</hi> 12. <hi>col.</hi> 114.</note> said to washe away our sinnes (Sacramentally.) In ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, it is called the lauer of Regeneration, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouation of the Holie Ghost. And in another place, it is made the seale of our iustification by faith, of remission of our sinnes, and sanctification in the Holy Ghost. To this effect wryteth the golden mouthed Doctor Saint <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome,</hi> in these golden wordes; <hi>Neque ideo solum, sed vt &amp; tu disceres, quontam super te quoque cum Sacro Fonte dilueris, Sanctus Spiritus veniat; iam vero non visibils specie, qua vtique non egemus, cum nobis pro cunctis sola fides sufficiat. Nam signa non credentibus, sed incredulis dantur.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither did the Doue appeare onely for that end, but that thou also mayst learne, that the Holy Ghost commeth vpon thee, when thou art washed in the holie Font; bu


<pb n="177" facs="tcp:1615:93"/>
that appearance is not nowe adayes in any visible shape, whereof wee haue no neede, seeing sole faith sufficeth for all. For signes are not giuen to the faithfull, but to the incredulous persons. These things well pondered: the obiection against the booke of Common prayer, will bee to no purpose: vnlesse perhaps it will bee a caueat for the Author, (which <hi>I</hi> heartilie wish,) to write and speake more circumspectly in time to come. For <hi>I</hi> verily am perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that all things contayned in the booke of Common prayer, are agreable to the holy Scriptures, &amp; the practise of the Church in the purest times, and composed with such Iudgement, Pietie, Learning, and Religion: that all the wisedome in the worlde, is not able iustlie to controll the same. In so much, that <hi>I</hi> wonder, and greatly admire the audacious temeritie of manie: who being of small rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and learning, (and of no iudgment and experience, if they bee compared to those auncient, graue, Godly, wise, and learned fathers, that compiled the booke of common prayer,) dare presume to condemne the same, with theyr bitter invectiues, vntimely censures, and vnchristianlike Anathematizations. True it is, that Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> saith: <hi>Nec sibi blandiantur, si de Scripturarum capitulis vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentur</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">

similitude of those things whereof they bee Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they were no Sacraments at all. And by reason of this similitude, they are often called by the names of the things themselues. As therefore after a certaine manner of speaking the Sacrament of the bodie of Christ, and the Sacrament of the bloud of Christ, are the bodie and bloud of Christ; so the Sacrament of faith, is faith. Neyther is it any other thing to Beleeue, then to haue Faith. And therefore, when answere is made, that the infant beleeueth, which as yet hath not faith in deed; it is answered, that hee beleeueth, for the Sacrament of faith: and that he doth conuert himselfe to God, for the sacrament of conuersion, because the answere it selfe, perteyneth to the Celebration of the Sacrament. Therefore, although that faith which consisteth in the will of the beleeuers, doth not make the childe faithfull: yet doth the Sacrament of that Faith make him faithfull. For euen as it is answered that hee doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, so is hee also called faithfull; not by signifying or graunting the thing it selfe in his minde, but by receyuing the sacrament of the thing. Thus writeth <hi>S. Austen,</hi> that auncient &amp; learned Father, out of whose words <hi>I</hi> obserue against rash heads, &amp; young Diuines, these most excellent instructions for the humble and Godly readers. First, that this holy &amp; learned father, (whose vertue and learning all <note place="margin">.1.</note> the Christian world hath hitherto honored, and admyred.) relyeth &amp; stayeth himself vpon the practise of the Church, which nowe adayes euery proude <hi>Brownist,</hi> and vnlearned <hi>Martinist,</hi> contemneth at his pleasure.

But in such matters doubtlesse, the Apostles rule must be obserued. Whose vse and administration he saith, is in our arbitrement and power: yet so, that we doe nothing against Gods ordinance, neither haue any desire to trouble the publique peace, whereof we must haue an especial care, for these externall matters. It is therefore this day lawfull for vs also, to institute and ordaine a newe the baptisme of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, (although it had not hither to bin vsed in the church) if any commoditie, or good successe of peace and concord, might insue thereupon.</p>
                     <p>Out of these learned discourses of these graue and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Writers, <hi>I</hi> obserue these memorable rules for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the gentle Reader.

This is a most wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy lesson, a most excellent rule, and a most necessarie ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation. Thirdly, that the dissentions and schismes stirred vp about externall rites and ceremonies, proceede from  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  the crastie and deceitful dealing of the diuel. Fourthly, that the Church hath power to make and constitute any lawes,  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>  which are not repugnant and contrarie to the word of God. Fiftly, that our Church hath this day power to haue institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>  the Baptisme of Infants, although it had not beene vsed in former ages. And consequently, that it hath power <hi>a fortiori,</hi> to set downe orders and lawes for the apparell of Ministers, for surplesles, square Caps, interrogatories in baptisme, and bowing of the knee at the name of Iesus, for kneeling at the holy Communion, for giuing thanks of women for their deliuerance from the perill of child-birth, for prohibiting to Preach without licence, for Reading of Homilies, and the like.

                  <p>I answere secondly, that the office of Deacons is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise this day in our English Churches, then it was of  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  old in all Churches throughout the Christian world. I <note place="margin">

                  <p>Thirdly, that Deacons in the Apostolique time and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church, did not onely serue the table, and minister  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  to the poore, but also baptize and preach the Gospell. I prooue it first, because there were Deacons at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> at <hi>Philippi,</hi> and in <hi>Crete;</hi> as may euidently be gathered of the Epistles, which were written to <hi>Timothie, Titus,</hi> and the <note place="margin">

                     <hi>Philippians.</hi> And for al that, there was in those places at that time such paucitie of Christians, as there could bee either small neede or none at all, for Deacons to attend vpon the tables. Secondly, because the solemnitie of imposition of hands, vsed in the ordering and consecration of Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  doth argue a further and more excellent function,


<pb n="187" facs="tcp:1615:98"/>
then the bare and sole ministerie of the table. This was well obserued by the great learned Doctor <hi>Illyricus,</hi> whose <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Illyricus, in</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 9.</note> wordes are these; <hi>Hinc autem apparet eos non tantum ad dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensationem elemosynarum alimentorumque, sed etiam ad insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutionem auditorum fuisse adhibitos, sicut &amp; illi Act.</hi> 6. <hi>etiam simul docuerunt, non tantum aeconomiam administrarunt; sed nimirum munus illorum fuit tantum rudiores instituere, seu ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techismum tradere, dum presbyteri omnibus sufficere laboribus nequeunt.</hi> Hence it is apparant, that the Deacons were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, not onely to distribute almes and reliefe to the poore, but also to instruct and teach their auditors, as they also, of whom mention is made in the acts, were occupied in teaching, and not onely in houshold-businesse.

                  <p>I proue it Thirdly, because <hi>Philippe</hi> the Deacon did not onely attend the poore, but was also occupied in Baptizing  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  and in Preaching.

                     <p>I answere first, that Saint <hi>Steuen</hi> answered in the way  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  of Preaching for edification sake, not in the way of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for his owne defence, albeit one may answere accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in a Sermon.

Secondly, hee was in the sinagogue of  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  the Libertines. Thirdly, the end and scope of his speech,  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  was to proue the true and pure worship of God, neither to be affixed to the Temple, nor to any externall ceremonies. All which being put together, it is cleere that Saint <hi>Steuen</hi> made a godly Sermon. This my answere is confirmed by <note place="margin">

Maister <hi>Caluin</hi> affirmeth constantly, that <hi>Philippe</hi> was first a Deacon, and afterward an Euangelist, Priest, or <note place="margin">

Secondly, that the church of England v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Deaconshippe, as a steppe or degree vnto Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, <note place="margin">2.</note> doth nothing against the iudgement of the auncient Fathers, but followeth the vsuall practise of the church in all ages. The reason hereof is, and euer was this; <hi>viz.</hi> that there might be some time of try all, of their behauiour in the Deaconshippe, before they were or could bee admitted to the order of Priesthood. No Councell, no Father, no hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie Ecclesiasticall, no time, no place, no person, since the Apostolike age, can be named to the contrary. To the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall practise of the Church from age to age, th' Apostles words may sitly be applied, when he saith: the deacons that <note place="margin">1. <hi>Ion.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 13</note> haue ministred well, get themselues a good degree.

<pb n="193" facs="tcp:1615:101"/>
it is not of necessitie, that euery Deacon become a Priest, by any canon or constitution of the church.

                  <p>Out of these testimonies, of these famous, godly, zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and most learned writers, I obserue these golden les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. First, that things of their own nature indifferent, doe  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  after a sort change their nature, so soone as they be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be done, or left undone, by the setled lawes of the Church. Secondly, that they bind the consciences of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  subiect to the Churches iurisdiction, so far and in such sort, that they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not at any time, or in any place transgresse the same without great sinne, if such transgression be ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and annexed, either to scandall or contempt. Thirdly, that whosoeuer reiecteth such lawes and ordinances of the  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  Church, contemneth the authoritie of God, &amp; not of men. Fourthly, that he sinneth grieuously, who either doth the  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>  things which the Church prohibiteth, or omitteth the things which she commandeth to be done, so long as her commandements remaine within the limits of things indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, which she appointeth for order, decencie and the common good of the Church.</p>
                  <p>I answere thirdly, that the Church hath authoritie to <note place="margin">Tertio Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:1615:105"/>
subiect to her iurisdiction. This point is sufficiently proued alreadie, both in this present Chapter, and in many others throughout this discourse. So that henceforth, one onely thing remaineth for me to proue; <hi>viz.</hi> That to minister the oath <hi>ex officio,</hi> whereby one is bound to accuse himselfe is either a thing lawfull of it selfe, or else <hi>Adiaphoron</hi> and a thing indifferent of it owne nature. I attempt the proofe. Euery thing is either good of it selfe, as God the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and giuer of all goodnesse, or euill of it selfe, as the blaspheming of God; or indifferent of it owne nature, as golde, money, oyle, wine, and such like. Now if the oath <hi>ex officio</hi> be good in it selfe, then doubtlesse, the Church may minister it to her subiects with out offence. None that hath sence or reason, will or can for shame denie the same. Againe, if it be <hi>Adiaphoron,</hi> a thing of it owne nature indifferent, then it is likewise in the power and libertie of the Church, to impose the same vppon euery member within her iurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>This is so sufficiently proued, as no deniall can bee made thereof. It is therefore either euill of it owne nature, or else doubtlesse it may not bee withstoode or gainesaide, that it is not ill of it owne nature, I thus proue it, and I wish the reader to marke well my wordes. If it bee euill, it is either euill simply and absolutely considered, as it is an oath: or else, as it is ministred to such a person. Not the former, because euerie magistrat may lawfully minister an oath, so often as due order of iustice doth require.</p>
                  <p>For as the Apostle saith, an oath for confirmation, is among men an ende of all strife. Yea, Gods name is confessed by true and lawfull oaths. For as holy <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6. <hi>Vers.</hi> 16.</note> saieth, thou shall feare the Lord thy GOD, and serue him, and shall sweare by his name. And the Prophet <hi>Ioremiah</hi> telleth vs, that it is euer lawfull to <note place="margin">

sweare for the aduancement of GODS glorie, and the profit of others, so these three conditions, iustice, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iere.</hi> 4 <hi>v.</hi> 2</note> iudgement, and truth, bee alwaies annexed vnto it <hi>viz.</hi> if wee sweare truly, reuerently, and iustly. Not the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>First. for that it may be, and often is ministred to many  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  without offence, as the aduersaries of the same oath cannot but confesse. But if it were euill of it owne nature, it could neuer be lawfully done.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, for that it is no sinne at all, for a sinner to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse himselfe of the sinne he hath committed. But it is a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  vertue to confesse our faults and offences, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy way to obtaine fauour at Gods hands. This knew ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Iosua</hi> right well, when speaking by the spirit of God hee <note place="margin">1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 9.</note> willed <hi>Achan</hi> to acknowledge his sinne. My sonne saith he, I beseech ye giue glorie to the Lord God of <hi>Israel,</hi> &amp; make <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ios.</hi> 7. 19.</note> confession vnto him, shewe mee now what thou hast done, hide it not from me. Loe, to confesse our secret sinnes to Gods minister, is to glorifie God and to honour his holy name. And therefore saith the note of the <hi>Geneua</hi> Bible, that God is glorified, when the truth is confessed. This knew Saint <hi>Mathew</hi> right well, when writing the Gospell of Iesus Christ, and reckoning vp the names of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. <hi>Vers.</hi> 3.</note> hee termeth himselfe <hi>Mathew</hi> the Publicane. This knew S. <hi>Paul</hi> right well, when he left it written to all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterities, that hee had bin a blasphemer, a persecuter, and an oppresser. This Saint <hi>Austen,</hi> Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> and many <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. <hi>Uers.</hi> 13.</note> other holy men knewe right well, when they inrolled their peculiar sinnes in their owne bookes, which they divulged to the view of the whole world.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, because the rule of charitie doth teach the same. How proue <hi>I</hi> that? forsooth, because our aduersaries herein  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  will not refuse to accuse ours neighbours by testifying the truth against them, when occasion so requireth euen vpon their oathes. And consequently, seeing the true loue of our <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. <hi>Vers.</hi> 39.</note> selues is that rule, by which our loue towards our neighbor


<pb n="203" facs="tcp:1615:106"/>
must be squared, it followeth of necessitie, that it is as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for vs to accuse and testifie against our selues, as it is to accuse and testifie against our neighbour. This reason can neuer be answered. And it will not serue to reply, that it is a cruell part to cause a man to accuse himselfe. For First,  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>  there is no more crueltie in ministring the oath, whereby the malefactor accuseth himselfe, then there is in giuing sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, against a felon or a traitor to suffer death. The reason is euident, because the Iudge be haueth himself alike in both cases. <hi>viz.</hi> He in both cases pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eth the part of Gods annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and lawfull minister. Secondly, it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth not of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>  of the oath but, <hi>per accidens</hi> that the partie sworne doth accuse himselfe. For, if he were innocent, as he is nocent; he could not be accused, by vertue of the oath. For, the oath is as free to commend him, as to condemne him, and as indifferent to acquit him, as to accuse him. If it were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, all that take the oath, shold be accused by vertue ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Which how false it is, all the Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> world can witnes. Thirdly, it is a vertue iustly to punish him, who vniustly  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>  hath done iniurie to others. Fourthly, it is a great sinne in a  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>  magistrate, to omit that punishment which iustly may be inflicted, to the harme &amp; great daunger either of the whole  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>  Church, or of many godly members in the same. Fiftly, the <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. <hi>Uers.</hi> 24.</note> oath doth onely induce <hi>iurantem</hi> to that by way of iustice, which hee is bound to doe by Gods law of his own accord  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>  
                     <hi>viz.</hi> to confesse the iniurie hee hath done, and to be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.</note> to his brother. Lastly, he sinneth grieuously, whoso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Uers.</hi> 2. 5. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13.</note> refuseth to confesse the truth, when his competent and lawful Iudge demandeth it iuridically at his handes. I therefore conclude that albeit the competent iudge cannot lawfully and iuridically exact an oath, for the manifestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of sinnes secret and altogether vnknowne, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause such secret sinnes are reserued onely and solely to the indgement of GOD,) yet when there goeth a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon fame, or when there is a vehement suspition, or <hi>semiplena probatio</hi> (as the Canons terme it,) of such a fact committed by such a Person: then the Iudge


<pb n="204" facs="tcp:1615:107"/>
may lawfully by iuridicall processe, exact a corporall oath of euery suspected person. In which case onely (as <hi>I</hi> conceiue it,) the oath <hi>ex officio</hi> is ministred, and in no other. In regard whereof, <hi>I</hi> would wish all inferiours to be more obedient and circumspect in future times, and not to be carried away head-long with audacious temeritie, peremptorily to censure and condemne the Lawes of their superiours, the true nature wherof, many of them doe little vnderstand.

The reason hereof is this; because it is in deede the very lawe of Nature, imprinted in euery mans heart in his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie, and so cannot be altered. The Iudiciall parte was properlie, and peculiarlie appointed of God, for conserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Iustice, among the <hi>Iewes,</hi> in the land of promise, the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> the land of <hi>Iewrie.</hi> The whole order of which gouernment ceased long fithence: <hi>viz.</hi> Euer since the people of <hi>Israell</hi> were expelled out of <hi>Iudaea,</hi> &amp; began to dwell amongst the Gentiles: liuing without Gouernours, without a King, without a Priest, and without a Lawe.

                        <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19. 30. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 4. <hi>Luke.</hi> 24. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 12.</note> by Christs most blessed and Sacred Aduent. For Christ was the ende of the Lawe; in whom were fulfilled as well the figures as the promises contayned in the Lawe, and the Prophets. All which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> compriseth pithily, in these golden wordes. For, if the Priesthoode bee chaunged, then of necessitie, the Lawe also must bee changed. Yea, Christ himselfe seemed to insinuate no lesse, when hee refused to condemne the adulteresse to death, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Iudiciall law of <hi>Moses;</hi> albeeit the Scribes &amp; Pharisees did euen then vrge him with the constitution of that Law.

For I stand not so much of Christs freeing the adulteresse, from the punishment of the Iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all law of <hi>Moses;</hi> as of that other ground, vppon which S. <hi>Austen</hi> stayeth himselfe. <hi>viz.</hi> That adulterie doth not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue the bond of holy Wedlock. For albeeit sundrie late Wryters, otherwise of great learning and rare gifts, doe


<pb n="206" facs="tcp:1615:108"/>
constantly teach (which some of our men haue also put in practise) that when the husband is diuorced from his wife, being an adulteresse then hee may lawfullie marrie an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: yet Saint <hi>Austen</hi> grounding his opinion, vppon the words of Christ, &amp; of S. <hi>Paul;</hi> concludeth constantly that whosoeuer shall marrie another wife, during the life of his former wife diuorced for adulterie, doth himselfe commit adulterie. Which (if it be true, which <hi>I</hi> leaue to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church,) prooueth euidently that the Iudiciall law of <hi>Moses</hi> is not of sorce.

                  <p>They demand, if the whole Law be abrogated? wee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, if whole <hi>Moses</hi> gaue place to Christ, then hath his whole law giuen place to the lawe of Christ. In the Lawe are commandements, promises, and figures. The comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of the law are morall, iudiciall, ceremoniall. That the ceremonialls are ceasled, it is thereby euident; for that the Priesthoode of the lawe, to which the ceremonies were annexed, is abrogated by the Priesthood of Christ, according to the order of <hi>Melchisedeth,</hi> &amp; was long since expired. And that the iudicialls are also ceased, it is herein manifest; for that the whole order of the gouernment of <hi>Israell,</hi> which was requisite vnto the inhabiting of the land of promise, hath fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that time ceased, when they being expelled, beganne to dwell among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> without a King, without gouernours, without a Priest, &amp; w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> out a law.</p>

                  <head>The Second Conclusion.</head>
                  <p>Although the law of <hi>Moses</hi> bee wholy expyred, so as of necessitie Christians are not bounde to the punishment therein prescribed against sinne &amp; sinners, yet is sinne this day as odious in Gods sight, as euer it was, and remaineth punishable by the law Morall, (which is the law of Nature) more fullie explained in the Law of the Newe Testament; but the quantitie &amp; kinde of punishment therein omitted, by reason of the mutabilitie of times, places, and persons, is wholly referred to the discretion of the wise &amp; Godly Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate. This conclusion containeth in it three parts: the expiration of the <hi>Mosaicall</hi> law: Gods wrath and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation against sinne, &amp; the quantitie &amp; kinde of punishing sinne, which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to the Magistrate. The first part is sufficiently cleered, by the context of the former co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clusion. The second part may be prooued by manie places of holie writ. For as th' Apostle saith: Tribulation &amp; anguish shalbe vpon the soule of euery man, that doth euill: of the <hi>Iew</hi> first, &amp; also of the <hi>Graecian.</hi> Again, in another place, the wages of <note place="margin">

The third and last part is proued two waies; affirmatiuely, and negatiuely. Of the former speaketh S. <hi>Paul,</hi> when hee telleth vs, That the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 3</note> is not to be feared for good workes, but for euil.  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>  Where hee rendreth the reason thereof: vz. for that he is Gods Minister, to take vengeance on him, that doth euill. Of the same speaketh Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> when hee affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the magistrate to bee appointed of God, for the punishment of euill doers, and for the prayse of them <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi>
                     </note> that doe well. Touching the latter there is no parte <note place="margin">14.</note> in the whole corpse of the new testament, or of the old this day in force, which determineth eyther the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie or kinde of punishment, with the which male fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors are to bee punished. This negatiue assertion is proofe sufficient, vntill some instance can bee giuen for the affirmatiue. Againe, as the Prophets containe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but an explication of the Law; so the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament containeth nothing but a cleare explication of the law and the Prophetes. This I haue elsewhere <note place="margin">In the down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall of Popery.</note> proued at large, where hee that listeth may reade the same: for all the kindes of punishment expressed in the Mosaicall Law were meere iudiciall, and are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die expired, as is proued in the former conclusion. The law Moral, (which is the law of nature) teacheth vs that <note place="margin">

False witnes was punished in som places onely with infamie, in other places with hanging. All lawes doe reuenge murder with blood, but yet with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers kinds of death. In some places there are grieuouser paines appointed for adulterers, in other places those that are more easie; yet wee see, how they all by this diuersitie of punishment, tend to one and the same end. For they all with one consent, giue sentence of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against those offences, which are condemned by the eternall lawe of god; to wit, murder, theft, adulterie, false witnes; but they agree not all; in the manner of the punishment: neithe truely is it necessarie or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, that they should agree therein. Their is a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey which should out of hand be destroied with theues and slaughter, if it did not with horible example deale verie sharpely with murderers. There is also some time, which requireth the enlarging of the sharpnes of punish<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment, and some people verie prone to some certaine sinne, vnlesse they be with great rigour kept in awe, he is then very euill affected and enuieth the publike com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie, that is offended with this diuersitie, which is most meete to retaine the obseruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the law of God. Thus writeth <hi>M. Caluin,</hi> adding much more to the like <note place="margin">1.</note> effect; which I omit in regard of breuitie, referring the <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 31.</note> reader to the place; out of whose words I note first, that all nations who haue (as <hi>S. Paule</hi> recordeth) the law of <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 14.</note> nature ingrafted in their harts, did not agree in the kind of punishing sin, but vsed some one kind, some another. <note place="margin">2.</note> Secondly, that theft, murder, false witnesse, adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and such like, haue not one and the same kinde of


<pb n="211" facs="tcp:1615:110"/>
punishment, in euerie people &amp; natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Thirdly, that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery is punished in some places sharply, in other som <note place="margin">3.</note> places more gentlie. Fourthly, that his diuersitie of the <note place="margin">4.</note> kinds of punishment, is not onely godly and lawfull, but also expedient and necessarie. And so, I conclude, that the law morall, (which onely law is now in force) doth leaue the quantitie and kinde of punishment, to be determined by the ciuill Magistrate.</p>

For the exact handling of this conclusion, (because it is a matter of great importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for many respects.)

First, this is a constant Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iome, approued by vniform assent of al learned diuines <hi>Cess inte fine legis, cessat lex ipsa.</hi> When the finall cause or end for which the law was made, ceaseth, then doth the law of necessitie also cease. This foundation is grounded vpon the holy scripture; where by the flat <note place="margin">
                        <hi>act.</hi> 15. <hi>v.</hi> 28. 29.</note> decree and setled law of the apostles, wee are bounde to abstaine fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> blood &amp; strangled meates. This notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, no man hath this day anie scruple of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to eate the same; &amp; yet hereof no other sound rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son can be yeelded, saue onely that the end for which that law was made, did lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g sithe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce cease. For eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at that time was no precise necessitie, to abstaine from blood and strangled meates; But this law was onely made, in respect of the state of that time; that the Gentiles and the Iewes might liue more peaceably together, &amp; there <note place="margin">let this point be well marked.</note> by avoid all occasion of contention and quarreling. And I therefor so soone as that end ceased, the law also

ceased with it, and so we are this day freede from the same, yea, this Axiome is euident <hi>lumine naturali,</hi> euen by the light of nature: for euery law is made for some end, which end how often soeuer it may bee accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed without the law, so often the execution of the law is needeles.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, wee must holde this for a constant foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, <note place="margin">The second foundation.</note> that albeit the ciuill Magistrate be commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to punish malefactors, yet is neither the kinde of punishment, nor the quantitie thereof taxed by the law of God, but it still abideth indifferent, to bee determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the supreme ciuill Magistrate: (for as I haue <note place="margin">

                  <p>Thirdly, wee must repute this for an vndoubted foundation; vz. that the end, for which Gods Law ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointeth <note place="margin">The third foundation.</note> malefactors to be punished, is the publike peace and good of the whole common-weale: for this is so euident by the course of the whole scripture, as it can neither with learning nor reason bee denied. <note place="margin">

First, that whensoeuer, any member of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale committeth any capitall crime, for which hee ought to die by the law, whose life for all that is


<pb n="213" facs="tcp:1615:111"/>
more profitable to the weale publike then his death; in such a case the Prince may pardon such a malefactor, &amp; not thereby sinne at all: which thing christian Princes seeme to respect, when in the time of warres, they set such felons at libertie, as are able to doe seruice in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Realme. Secondly, that when any male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor <note place="margin">The second Corollarie.</note> is so mightie, or so strongly seated, or otherwise so vnfit to bee dealt withall, that the Prince cannot without probable daunger of his royal person, or great domage to the common-weale, punish the said male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor; then in such a case, the prince may tollerate such a malefactor vnpunished, and not thereby sinne at all. These foundations and illations being once well vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstoode and remembred, the conclusion (though of great moment,) cannot but be manifest and cleare.

                  <p>It is a generall Maxime receiued not onely in Diuinitie, but in Philosophie also; <hi>Ex duobus malis, minus eligendum.</hi> Of two euils the lesser is to bee chosen, that is to say; when two euils con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur, so that both cannot be auoided, but that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarilie the one must happen; then it is not onclie not sinne, but godlie VVisedome, and Christian Policie, to preuent, and auoide the greater euill, with permission and tolleration of the lesse. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample sake; it is euill for a man to cutte off his owne arme or legge, if the thing bee absolutely, and simply considered in it selfe, yet to cut it off

least the whole bodie putrifie or perish; is a very lawful act. Which thing all Christian Princes, &amp; Monarches seeme to respect, when they in sundrie cases doe tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate sinne vnpunished. The blessed man <hi>Moses,</hi> so high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly renowned in holy writte, pardoned great malefactors in the hainous crime of diuorce, and this tolleration he graunted to auoide a greater euill; that is to say, least the Iewes vpon euery light cause should poyson those wiues whome they did not loue, for that such light di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorcement was onely permitted, but neyther by God, not by <hi>Moses</hi> approued; I will demonstrate by these <note place="margin">1.</note> important and insolluble reasons. First, because these are Christes owne wordes; <hi>Moses</hi> because of the harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of your heartes, suffered you to put away your <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 31. <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 7.</note> wiues, but fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beginning it was not so.

                     <hi>which is in subiection to a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is bound by the Law to the Ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, while hee liueth; but if the man be di ade, shee is deliuered from the law of the man: So then if while the man liueth, shee take an other ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, she shal be called an adulteresse.</hi> Out of these words I note first, that marriage cannot bee dissolued, during <note place="margin">1.</note> the life of the former husband. I note secondly, that this was so euen in <hi>Moses</hi> law; because Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith <note place="margin">2.</note> hee speaketh to them that knew the law, I note third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <note place="margin">3.</note> that to be married after diuorce for a light cause, during the life of the former husband is plaine &amp; flat adulterie. I therefore conclude, that to tollerate sinne vnpunished vpon good cause, is no sin at all. This mine assertion of diuorcement is not onely grounded vpon the Scriptures, but also confirmed by the holy fathers, and best approued writers of this our age.</p>

The negatiue bind vs at all times euery houre, and in euery place; but the affirmatiue, thogh they be very apt to bind, yet doe they not actually bind vs, saue then onely, when the due circumstances of times, places, and persons occurre, hereupon it commeth that it is neuer lawfull to steale, neuer lawful to commit ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, neuer lawfull to beare false witnes, neither at any time, nor in anie place. the reason hereof is this, because these precepts be negatiue. This notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it is sometime lawfull to omit the precepts affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue. For exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple it is necessary vnto saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to mak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of our faith; and yet we doe and may often o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the same, for that it is an affirmatiue precept. And therfore Christ willeth vs not to giue that which is holy to dogs; neither to cast our pearles before swine; leaste they tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But wee are then bound to confesse our faith when either it tendeth to the glorie of God, or to the good of our neighbour; so that if such confession were not then made, either god should be dishonoured, or our neighbour scandalized. So it is Gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to giue him thy cloake, that will sue the at the law, and take away thy caate; &amp; yet maiest thou at sundry times <note place="margin">

All which and other the like haue this onely ground and foundation; vz. That they are precepts, affirmatiue, which neither bind at all times, nor yet in all places.

                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, that the ciuill magistrate had authoritie, to mitigate many punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts ordained for malefactors, <note place="margin">Secundò.

                     <p>A law may be made, that he which doth it shall not be punished; euen as it is in the princes pleasure, to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and releasse the punishment. But that that be not sinfull, which nature it selfe sheweth to be sinfull; no law maker can effect or bring to passe. Thus writeth this learned man, granting freely as we see; that the magistrate may sometime vpon good causes, tolerate those sinnes vnpunished, which gods law doth sharply reproue and speake against, where the reader must ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue with me, that Maister <hi>Caluin</hi> speaketh of the most notorious sinnes of incest; and consequently that hee graunteth power vnto the magistrate, to pardon what Malefactors or sinnes, so euer: For though the magistrate can neuer make that


<pb n="220" facs="tcp:1615:115"/>
to be no sinne, which Gods lawe prounceth to bee sinne; yet (saith <hi>M. Caluin)</hi> the magistrate may make a law, that the same sinne shal not be punished, Which doubtles is the selfe same doctrine, that I do teach for the present.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, that by the law of the New Testament, the Prince is onely charged in generall tearmes to punish <note place="margin">Tertiò prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipaliter.</note> malefactors, and that for the common good of his faithfull people, in regard whereof, hee may lawfullie cease from punishing them; when the common inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded good of his subiectes, eyther can not, or wil not insue thereupon. For if Kinges should at all times pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish all malefactors; the Church of God would often be depriued of most excelent and profitable members. For which respect our Sauiour himselfe telleth vs, that when the tares cannot be seuered from the good corn, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

As if hee had saide: when the wicked cannot be punished, but with great domage to the godly; then may the Magistrate tollerate such ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors <note place="margin">

                     <p>In this intricate question, I wil say no new or stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge thing, but euen that which the soundenes of the church obserueth; that when any Christian, which in the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie of the church, shalbe taken with any such offéce, as shall deserue an anathematization, the same be done where there is no perill of schisme. For our Lorde himselfe, when hee saide to those that woulde gather the tares, suffer them to grow vntill the haruest; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised the cause, saying, least while yee desire to gather the tares, ye plucke vp also the wheate. VVhere hee sheweth sufficiently; that when there is no such feare, but there abideth securitie enough of the stabilitie of the corne, that is, when euerie mans crime is so appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and execrable to all, that eyther it hath none at al, or no such patrones as are able to raise vp a schisme, then may not the seueritie of discipline bee a sleepe.
