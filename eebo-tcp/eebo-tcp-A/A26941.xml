            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE Immortality of the Soul is a thing indiſputable, and the natural proneneſs of Man to ſin, is a thing undeniable: But the Body which ſhould be as a ſervant to the Soul, is now (the more is the pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) taken more care for in one day, then the ſoul in one year. How diligent are Men for the preſervation of their bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly health, by providing for themſelves what Delicates the appetite deſires: while their poor ſouls are even ſtarved
<pb facs="tcp:42568:4"/>
for want of Heavenly Food, and ready to faint for want of Divine Cordials: if the body be diſtempered, the Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is run for, but the poor Soul which ſometimes lyes in a periſhing condition ſhall not find one Dram of Spiritual Comfort to Refreſh it ſelf: Oh Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, conſider how it will be with you at the laſt Day if you ſuffer your poor ſouls to be thus Ship-wrackt, conſider the price of your ſouls, which coſt no leſs then the precious blood of Ieſus Chriſt to redeem them, the riches of the whole world is not worth one ſoul that now is ſo little regarded; it had better been for thoſe who are ſo careleſs of their Souls never to have had any, but to have been like a brute Beaſt, that when it Dyes there is an end of him; but it is not ſo with Man, for he ſhall give an Account at the great day of all his worldly tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, the neglecting of his Soul, the too great care of his body, the ſtarving of the one and the pompering of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; which though they know it muſt Dye and ſhall Dye, yet will they take more care for it then that which cannot nor ſhall not dye, but live for ever in endleſs joys, or unſpeakable torments.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:42568:4"/>Beſides this great neglect of moſt Men, there are more very great and dangerous defects in and amongſt ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing profeſſors, who are ſo ſecure in their ſins, that they will confidently affirm, That if any go to Heaven, they ſhall be of that number; for ſay they, VVe have Lived Honeſtly, we have done no Man wrong, we have not Lived Debauched Lives, we are not given to any noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Vice, but never conſider that they have brought ſin enough into the world to Damn them, without the great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God, who only can preſerve and keep us from that Lake of Everlaſting Torment provided for thoſe who ſhall not Dye in the Lord.</p>
            <p>How few is there that are convinced of Original ſin imputed to them? and how many that never conſider that they with <hi>Adam</hi> Tranſgreſſed by eating the Forbidden Fruit; Nay, I fear do not ſo much as buſie their Thoughts with any ſuch matter, but are ſatisfied with their morallity, and account themſelves upright in their dealing, and ſo conclude they are in a fair way for Heaven: but alas! poor Deceived ſouls, this is not ſufficient for you, for you will never ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
<pb facs="tcp:42568:5"/>
at that deſired Haven of Happineſs without a better wind do fill your ſails, he will fall ſhort of his deſires who put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his truſt in his own VVorks or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, for all the Impieties of Mens wicked lives are nothing in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that venome which lodges in the heart by nature, and Man himſelf hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſenſible thereof: Oh wretched ſtate that Man knows not his own heart, but hath a Thouſand times more ſin in him unknown, then the greateſt ſelf-conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perſon in the world can ſee perfection in himſelf: few there are that are not too ſtrongly and too well opinionated of themſelves, and ſome have high e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem of others, and will ſay, that ſuch a one is a good natur'd Man, he hath no deceit in him, he would not wrong a VVorm: when alas, theſe Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are nothing in compariſon of that Ocean of Sin, deformed Corruption, which lurks in his heart, and cannot be rooted out but by that Heavenly Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote which alone can expell the Poyſon of ſin out of our corrupted Hearts, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Men do not conſider that their wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful minds are not nor cannot be ſubject to the Law of God, which is abſolutely
<pb facs="tcp:42568:5"/>
pure without ſpot or blemiſh, whilſt the beſt of our actions, the ſupream of our thoughts, are vain, ſinful and Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
            <p>The Carnal mind thinks of nothing more then to provide for this preſent Life, and hath no reflection upon Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, nor makes any proviſion againſt that ſevere VVinter which undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will follow the pleaſant Summer of our pleaſure and delight, but minds on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the preſent things of this Life, with the neglect of ſeeking after eternal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs: would not you account him ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly who would exchange Diamonds for Pebbles, Gold for Droſs, or Liberty for a Goal? how much more is he then to be accounted witleſs, that minds mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary pleaſures before Everlaſting Happineſs, taketh more care for his mortal Body then his immortal Soul, and prizes the Riches of this VVorld, which have VVings and will flye away, before thoſe never-ceaſing joys which attend all thoſe who do moſt faithfully and diligently ſeek after and earneſtly deſire to obtain them. Carnal minds are ſlaves to the more ignoble parts of our ſouls, and love that beſt which is
<pb facs="tcp:42568:6"/>
leaſt worth: we have ſuch a ſimpathiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nature toward ſin and momentary pleaſure, that we do not only endeavour to extenuate the culpableneſs of the Crimes, but rather juſtifie and Plead for them, being ſo agreeable to our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Natures. And thus do we VValk dayly more and more in ſin, till at laſt we are brought into ſuch a Labyrinth of ſin that we cannot find the way out, nor can our blinded Conſciences tell us our errours of our lives, for we conclude all is well with us, we do juſtifie our ſelves with good opinions of our ſelves, and thus we erroniouſly deceive our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-dying ſouls.</p>
            <p>Again, Some have a kind of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing willingneſs to ſin, and could wiſh that ſuch and ſuch things were no ſins, becauſe they are ſo ſuitable to their ſinful deſires, they had rather to live a brave, jovial, merry life, like ſervants to ſin, then a ſober, ſerious, and holy life like ſervants of God: thus ſtill are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent injoyments preferred before ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Crowns of Glory to come, and conclude with the Old Proverb, <hi>A Bird in hand, is worth two in a Buſh</hi>: theſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments they are certain of, but future
<pb facs="tcp:42568:6"/>
injoyment, they may miſs, poor incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous ſinners, dare you not take Gods word for what he hath promiſed, think you that he will make any abatement of the Reward which he hath promiſed to beſtow upon thoſe who keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, and walk in the paths of Righteouſneſs? No, it cannot be, he will rather add then diminiſh from your joys, he takes as much delight in mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying mercies, as you in multiplying ſins, and what he hath promiſed ſhall be made good.</p>
            <p>Some alſo are blinded in their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, ſo as to love what they ſhould have hated, and hate what they ſhould love, and yet are not ſenſible of what a ſad condition they are in, but go mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily on, and fear not but in the end they ſhall be ſaved, concluding that there are many Thouſands far worſe then they that live in open ſins and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which they abhor; and ſome of theſe, if not moſt or all of them, will ſay that they hope to be ſaved as well as others, and if they can hope for ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, well may they who live much more Civilized and ſtrangers to theſe enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Crimes and deteſtable practiſes:
<pb facs="tcp:42568:7"/>
yet ſtill do they deceive themſelves, and look not upon ſin ſo as to ſee it in its greateſt deformity, which makes De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils of many who are ſtill fighting and ſtriving againſt God and his moſt juſt Laws, and do not conſider that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil is the Authour of it, but ſtill flatter up themſelves, and ſay, That they have nothing to do with the Devil, nor he with them, yet are never better pleaſed then when they are buſied about the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils work: They conclude, that they can live in ſin and defie the Devil and all his works.</p>
            <p>How few is there that can give a true definition of ſin, and what an Enemy it is to all Mankind; for had it not been for that bleſſed Mediator Chriſt Ieſus, the whole frame of Nature had been ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deſtroyed by it.</p>
            <p>Sin is abſolutely contrary to the will of God, therefore ſhould it be abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deteſtable to the Heart of Man, ſin would pull down what Gods holy Laws would ſet up, and Eſtabliſh Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed Laws for the ſalvation of ſouls, and the Devil deviſeth ſins for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of ſouls, yet will not poor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſee that impurity which in ſin it is
<pb facs="tcp:42568:7"/>
clearly contrary to the very Nature of God. It is univerſally evil, there is no good in it, nor can come any good of it, Men are not eaſily perſuaded there is any good in Poverty, Reproach, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, Perſecution, but very eaſily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there is good in ſin.</p>
            <p>This jumps with their opinion, this ſuits with their ſinful Natures, and all things fall out according to their world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſires: but never to take into conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration the Evil effects and Miſerable Conſequences of ſin, the VVriting on the wall is not minded while they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live.</p>
            <p>VVere it posſible for Men to go to Hell-Gate, there to hear the Terrible ſhrieks and crys of the Damned: Or could we perſuade People to believe the words of the Prophet, <hi>There is no peace to the Wicked;</hi> then ſurely Men would not ſet their Delights upon ſin, which is the ſole Object of Gods hatred, and nothing ſeparates betwixt God and ſouls but ſin; though ſin fills the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience with Terrour, Hell with Fire, yet few are affrighted hereat, but conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in their old Road of wickedneſs, till Iudgment follows cloſe and before they
<pb facs="tcp:42568:8"/>
are aware overtakes and deſtroys them in the midſt of their ſins.</p>
            <p>There are alſo ſome who are clearly caſt out of the favour of God, yet are not at all ſenſible of their miſerable conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but go dauncing along in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils Chains, and mind not that the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is given forth, becauſe it is not forthwith executed, though there may be but a little breath before they for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver periſh.</p>
            <p>How many is there that never knew what a wounded Conſcience or the fear of Iudgement means, yet count them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Noble Spirits, and promiſe to themſelves Peace, reckon themſelves needy of nothing; when alas, poor decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſouls, they need but all.</p>
            <p>Though Miniſters dayly labour to convince them of their errors, yet they reſt confident that their Condition is good as the Preciſians, nor can ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſideration take ſuch hold on them as to cauſe them to loſe one Minutes reſt to lament their ſad Conditions, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were they ſo ſenſible of the inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable Burthen of ſin, as to cry out <hi>What ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi> And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe they are dead in Sins
<pb facs="tcp:42568:8"/>
and Treſpaſſes. Death is a Thing which deprives us of ſenſe as well as of Life: the Dead fear not though threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the greateſt of puniſhments; The Dead fear not though God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce woes upon woes againſt them: The Dead ſee not, though Hell be ſo frightful a place: The Dead ſmell not, though ſin ſtinks worſe then rotten Sepulchres: The Dead feel not, tho' Mountains of lead were lying on them: They complain not as <hi>Cain</hi> did in the Bitterneſs of ſoul, by reaſon of Sin: Nor ſay with <hi>Hannah,</hi> that they were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of a ſorrowful ſpirit.</p>
            <p>And though there be an Entayl of wrath upon the very ſins they live in; though Hell be open to receive the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent and hard-hearted ſinner; and though room is preparing for them to entertain them with the Vegeance of a Diſpleaſed God, yet few VVork out their ſalvation with Fear and Trembl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but fall ſhort of the ſenſe of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite. Oh I pitty theſe ſecure ſouls, how ſhort will they fall of their hopes, and not only ſo, but how far will they fall ſhort of Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:42568:9"/>And again, Some are not ſenſible that it is Sathan who finds out theſe ſtratagems to deſtroy their poor ſouls, or that he hath the Poſſesſion of the Hearts of the Vnregenerate: but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that he hath VValks in the Hearts of meer Natural Men, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore plain it is, that while thou art Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate, he is as certainly entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, as ever he was into the Herd of Swine, and will hurry thee into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, as them into the Sea.</p>
            <p>Though ſome may be convinced of the Deformity of ſin, yet they are not convinced of the necesſity of Perſonal and conſtant Obedience, which is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by the Covenant of works, but conclude, that if there be any failure in the whole Law, ſo much as to a vain thought, that then this Covenant is broke, and nothing but dread and fear ſhall ſeize upon ſuch a ſoul.</p>
            <p>But to prevent theſe ſorrowful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of Neglect or miſconſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Take my advice, and apply your ſelf wholly to God by Prayer for his asſiſtance: Prayer is a thing which ſhuts up Hell &amp; opens Heavens Gates; yet how little hath Prayer been uſed
<pb facs="tcp:42568:9"/>
as it ought to be, it is too often ſeen that Men under affliction appeal to God by prayer, but afflictions being once paſt, he forgets again, and prayer is neglected. It is very ſad, when our affections are ſo little Heaven-ward, as that we aim not at all at Gods Glory, but altogether our own advantage? how can we expect that God can have any reſpect to our prayers, when we have none to his Divine Majeſty, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps if we be not preſently anſwered, we flye out into extreams, and ſpeak contemptuouſly of our Creator, who can in one minute throw us all into E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Miſery: ſuch is our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſuch is our wickedneſs, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every occaſion we are apt to charge God wrongfully, nay, ſpeak almoſt blaſphemouſly: though the cauſe why our prayers are not anſuered is in our ſelves: To live without prayer is to be dead while alive, for it is to live without God: what can you do leſs for God then <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y this hommage to own him for your Creator? or what can you do leſs for your own ſouls, then beg for their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of him who alone can grant it?</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:42568:10"/>Prayers may well be counted and and called ſallies of the ſoul for more Grace, and neglect of them can be no leſs than provocation, it grieves God to ſee that he ſhould be ſo merciful and gracious as to let his Door ſtand o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, and that he ſhould aſſure us of a VVelcome at any time, and that we ſhould be ſo unkind as not to viſit him with our prayers, which ſhould be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as Embasſies to his Divine Majeſty, he cannot but take this very unkindly.</p>
            <p>Conſider the Reward which is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to prayer, you have Chriſts word for it, for he ſaith, <hi>When thou Prayeſt, enter into thy Cloſet, and when thou haſt ſhut thy Door, pray to thy Father which is in ſecret, and thy Father which ſeeth in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, ſhall Reward thee openly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding this ſo ſweet promiſe, how is this Duty by ſome omitted, and by others quite deſerted. Satan is an utter Enemy to prayer, and ſtudies out many ways to put by prayer, he perſuades ſome that if they do pray, it will be but Hypocritically:
<pb facs="tcp:42568:10"/>
others that it is not a convenient time, for ſome worldly buſineſs is to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched, or any fallaſie to put by this Holy Duty, for the Devil doth ſeek and contrive all the ways that posſibly can be uſed by him to intrap and inſnare Mans ſoul, on purpoſe to make it as miſerable as himſelf: But Man was Created for a more Nobler deſign then to be led Captive by the devil, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is the main inſtrument to avoid all his allurements.</p>
            <p>Private Prayer is in a manner a ſecret talking with God, and who would not be glad to have ſuch bleſſed Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him, who onely can make us eternally happy, or everlaſting mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable: it is ſomewhat Saint like to deſire private Conference betwixt God and the ſoul.</p>
            <p>But let not the Devil ſo blind your Eyes, neither as to think that the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering a parcel of good and rhetorical expresſions after any manner of way or formality, will be taken for prayer with God: No, that will not do, for you muſt pray ardently, affectionately,
<pb facs="tcp:42568:11"/>
ſincerely, zealouſly, earneſtly, and alſo conſtantly: and if you would have your prayers anſuered, you muſt wait with patience, for Gods time is the beſt and fitteſt time to anſwer prayer in, for he knows beſt when and how to anſwer us, and what is fitteſt for us to enjoy: but many there are, who becauſe that their prayers and petitions are not anſuered preſently according to their expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, do preſently revolt from their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of prayer, thinking that becauſe God doth not ſuddenly anſuer them, he doth not take any care of them: when alas poor ſouls, if they did but remain conſtant and fervent in their devotions, God hath promiſed to be heard by them, and that he will aid and ſuccour them according to their necesſities.</p>
            <p>VVe ought to ſubmit our wills to his will, whether our prayers be anſuered or no, and not to deſiſt from praying becauſe we enjoy not the thing which we do earneſtly pray for.</p>
            <p>For to deſiſt from good VVorks or Holy Duties, is ſome ſmall kin to Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy, and Back-ſliding will ſuddenly
<pb facs="tcp:42568:11"/>
bring you out of acquaintance with God, and then will this Duty (ſo Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for all Chriſtians) be Totally extirpated, and you become a <hi>Nebuch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adnezzar,</hi> unto a Heathen will you ſoon turn.</p>
            <p>If thou doſt love God, thou wilt love to be with him in private, where thou mayeſt freely impart thine affections unto him. Let not thy Religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in thy Family be uſed on purpoſe to keep up thy Credit with Men, for God who is the ſearcher of all Hearts, will not be ſo hypocritically ſerved, the upright and the ſincere heart the Lord loveth.</p>
            <p>Make it thy Buſineſs to wait upon God in private, for when thou art by thy ſelf then thou art the fitteſt to call upon God, as being at that preſent freed from worldly incumbrances. The Heathen <hi>Scipio</hi> doth much Commend theſe private ſolitudes, for ſaith he, <hi>Then can I freely entertain my own ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, and Converſe with all the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that have been in former ages.</hi> But thy Honour is greater to converſe with
<pb facs="tcp:42568:12"/>
God, who loves to Commune with the ſoul in private, and communicates his affections to his people in ſecret: <hi>David</hi> praiſed God ſeven times a Day, but his Day ſacrifices yielded him not that marrow and ſweetneſs which he taſted in the Night, being then ſeque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred from all Buſineſs which might impede or hinder his godly and pious intentions.</p>
            <p>VVhen we are alone, ſatan is moſt buſie, and then have we the moſt need of Heavens Auxiliaries. No ſooner doth the True Chriſtian open his eyes from ſleep, but he opens his heart like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to God, and poſts to Heaven with ſecret ejaculations and praiſes to Gods Holy Name, and doubts not but that God will be as willing to receive as he to offer up his Morning ſacrifice.</p>
            <p>Beſides, many Miſchiefs attend by deferring Holy Duties, which God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly in his VVord hath commanded we ſhould diligently keep: God is not willing to be ſerved laſt of all, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects the firſt fruits, and reaſon good, becauſe he beſtows upon us his choiceſt
<pb facs="tcp:42568:12"/>
Blesſings. Then let me perſuade all thoſe that deſire their ſouls everlaſting good, not to neglect this Holy Duty, which will be ſo beneficial to your ſouls, and ſo pleaſing unto our Almighty God, which that you may ſincerely do, ſhall be the prayers of him that ſubſcribeth himſelf a hearty well-wiſher to all your ſouls.</p>
