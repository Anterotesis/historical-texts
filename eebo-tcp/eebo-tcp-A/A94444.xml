         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

aſhort ſtory with a
long preface: yet I
count it a part of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilitie,
that I am
bound to obſerve, ſince I bring a ſmall
preſent to the Publick to ſay ſomewhat
in delivering of it, about my ſelfe
and my intention; which happily
may ſerve for a juſt apology to the
undertaking of one, that yet hath
ſcarce ſeen the world beyond five
luſtres. I have had the happineſſe
to paſſe ſome time at my own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
in acquanting my ſelfe with the
principall parts of <hi>EUROPE:</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:115788:5"/>
and having had no greater ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
in any other either exerciſe,
or diverſion, then to gain a true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
of the preſent age, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I live, to be compared with what
I hear and read, I have added ſome
ſtudy to my obſervation, that ſo deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending
a little lower, I might the
better know the Cauſes, and Connexion
of things that are now upon the ſtage.
And when I had well furniſhed my
ſelfe with thoſe perquiſites, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to this end, I found my notes
growing too tedious to be almoſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
for the fire. Only firſt I deſired
to draw out ſome of the choicer remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques,
and then leave the reſt to the
ſentence. But ſetting my ſelfe to
this buſineſſe I knew not how to forme
any one deſigne; till at laſt, finding
my references to this ſubject, that
I now exhibit to the common light,
more exquiſite then the reſt, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
a criticall part of Hiſtory, and
more difficult to be collected then
<pb facs="tcp:115788:5"/>
ſuch as run in the ordinary periods of
Kings lives, I took up my books again,
being now moved with an emulation
of deſerving, if I might poſsibly,
the publick thanks. Wherein if I
find not my ſelfe diſappointed, there
may be a ſecond part added to compleat
this argument, by purſuing it to the
end of the firſt years <hi>REGEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CY,</hi>

being forrainers to
the <hi>French;</hi> have not
beene ſomewhat cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
to knit their ends of intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
how the preſent high engine
of that <hi>Monarchy,</hi> being himſelfe a
forrainer, and borne a ſubject of
their Grand enemy, the <hi>King</hi> of
<hi>Spaine,</hi> ſhould arrive at that place,
where he now governs: eſpecially
conſidering that theſe two emulous
Nations, howſoever continually
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:115788:7"/>
intrigued to out-bid one another for
the amity of their neighbours, are
yet alike propellers of them from
their politicall intereſtly. They both
court equally every <hi>Italian</hi> (and
he againe is as great a courtier of
them both) but it is to get the rule
over them, and not to be ruled by
them, wherein they reciprocally
underſtand one another, and vie it
out in policy; ſo that all parties ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
their owne turne keeps the
ballance even. The <hi>Italians</hi> upon
occaſion lend their intereſt; the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
parties lend their ſtrength
which is the cauſe why the firſt can
never want at their pleaſure to have
honorable commands in either ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:
but for intrinſecating in their
civill government (if I may ſo
ſpeak) this <hi>Mazzarini</hi> is the firſt
example; and that alſo at ſuch a
time and ſtate of affaires, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
by diſſention of the Princes,
when there was no other to adviſe
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:115788:7"/>
with him or command his actions,
beſides the daughter of <hi>SPAIN,</hi>
and ſiſter of the preſent <hi>PHI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIP,</hi>
with whom the warre was
commenced. I ſhall therefore
take ſome pleaſure to goe a litle
forth with my Reader to meete
this <hi>Cardinall,</hi> and ſo follow him
with his train from his firſt ſcene
of <hi>Italy</hi> to his ſecond of <hi>France,</hi>
where we intend to conſider him
in his firſt act of fortune: for
he has beene as great a ſubject of
ſtrange concurrences of events
in his owne perſon, as any other.
Nor is it any diſparagement to
his perſonall ſufficiency, ſince
whom it pleaſeth God to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
above others, he commonly
endoweth more.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Card. Mazzarini</hi> was a
ſoldier, a courtier, put into the
prelacy, and made a Nuntio by
one and twenty, and in theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally
knew his game ſo well,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115788:8"/>
that it might be ſoone ſeene he was
not to throw for ſmall matters.
<hi>Savoy</hi> was the tennis-court, which
firſt admired his dexterity, where
he ſaved <hi>Caſale,</hi> and therein the
whole <hi>French</hi> intereſt (at that time)
towards <hi>Lombardy,</hi> before his play,
being very ſerious, was diſcovered;
and then hitting alſo <hi>Pignerol</hi> into
their hazzard, by his incomparable
addreſſe in treating that <hi>Duke,</hi> he
went off with the great regret of
the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and applauſe of his
<hi>Frenchmen.</hi> The former in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of his ſervices, ſought to
ruine his intereſts at Rome, as a trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
to both the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
King.</hi> And it ſeemed the
<hi>Pope</hi> had beene much injured in his
quality of <hi>Umpire,</hi> by the partiality
of his <hi>Nuncio,</hi> who therefore found
it moſt convenient to accept of the
<hi>Savoyards</hi> courteſy for a time, till
his intereſts might be adjuſted.
But the <hi>Card.</hi> of <hi>RICHELIEU</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:115788:8"/>
had a greater paſſion to receive and
remerce him at the Court of <hi>France,</hi>
where he ſo entertained him, that
he made his pretenſions good to
the hat (the uſuall reward of thoſe
<hi>Nuncio's,</hi> that returne with a <hi>re benè
geſtâ</hi>) by the continuall applications
of the <hi>French Miniſters</hi> at <hi>Rome;</hi>
but would never let him go thither
to receive it. And now being qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified
with the title of <hi>Cardinall,</hi>
he procures the <hi>King</hi> to nominate
him as his <hi>pleny-potentiary</hi> for the
<hi>Generall peace,</hi> which was no leſſe
then to entruſt him with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts
of the Crowne and of its
confederates: and accordingly <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelieu</hi>
now treats with him, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining
every ſpring, and parcelling
every implement of his breaſt to
diſcover to him; and the quality of
this employment might allow time
for it, for it was not preſently to
be entered on. In the interim, this
new creature to commend his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115788:9"/>
the more dearly to the
Crowne, undertakes two famous
treaties to reduce the <hi>Princes</hi> of
<hi>Savoy</hi> from the intereſts of <hi>Spain</hi>
to the contrary of <hi>France:</hi> The
firſt was concluded and ſigned; but
the ſudden breaking out of the
<hi>Counts</hi> of <hi>Soiſſons</hi> and <hi>Bouillon</hi> hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
the effect, and gave the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall</hi>
leiſure (as ſome would have
it) being now nigh upon the place,
to gaine alſo the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Monaco,</hi>
whoſe acceſſion afterwards was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
of great conſequence.
The ſecond treaty brought the firſt
to an iſſue, reuniting thoſe <hi>Princes</hi>
at the ſame time to the ſide of
<hi>France,</hi> and to the head of their
houſe, the then <hi>Infant-Duke</hi> of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy:</hi>
an union whereunto the moſt
part of the places conquered in <hi>Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi>
and <hi>Montferrat</hi> is aſcribed.
After his returne from theſe affaires,
he accompanies the <hi>Cardinall</hi> of
<hi>Richelieu</hi> in that voyage; which
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115788:9"/>
brought <hi>Cincmars</hi> (the grand Eſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer,
and his competitor in the Kings
favour) his deſignes to the light,
and his head to the block: but while
the <hi>Cardinall Duke</hi> is urging ſtill
his jealouſies to greater envie in
this buſineſſe, this other <hi>Cardinall</hi>
finds himſelfe a better worke to
perſwade the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> one
of the Complices, to deliver up his
ſoveraignty of <hi>Sedan</hi> to the <hi>Kings</hi>
power, as a ranſome for his treaſon,
which accordingly he obtained, and
the <hi>King</hi> ſeized. This was the
gate by which <hi>Mazzarini</hi> entered
equally into <hi>Richelieu's</hi> and the
<hi>King's</hi> favour, but eſpecially by
the <hi>douceur</hi> and gentleneſſe of his
proceeding, which made the <hi>King</hi>
deſire his imployment; being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
weary of <hi>Richelieu's</hi> exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive,
and now more intemperate
rule by reaſon of his malady: ſo
that that favorite could not comply
better with the <hi>King's</hi> pleaſure in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115788:10"/>
any other ſuit then this of ſerving
himſelfe of <hi>Mazzarini:</hi> in whoſe
perſon both might find their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
ends, as well as their publick.
The <hi>Cardinall</hi> might raiſe in him a
<hi>Protector</hi> of his houſe and kindred
againſt their moſt incenſed emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors;
and the <hi>King</hi> find a ſubject by
whom to ballance the <hi>Princes</hi> of
the <hi>Blood,</hi> when he was gone; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Orleans,</hi> againſt
whoſe ſway he deviſed all means
poſſible to provide.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Cardinall</hi> of <hi>Richelieu</hi> had
tooke his fortune, as it were, to
farme, putting his terme of life into
the leaſe, which was therefore to
be circumſcribed with his <hi>Maſter's:</hi>
for had he outlived him, it is a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
whether all his admirable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients
could have ſerved to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
a harder fate, which being
inſtigated by much envy would
faine have ſtetched a long arme to
reach him. And the ſenſe of this,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115788:10"/>
while the <hi>King's</hi> health ſeemed to
decay faſter then his owne, had
caſt the <hi>Cardinall</hi> into many pangs
of contrivances, how to make his
eſtate good, when his plea in chiefe
was gone. Sometimes to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
himſelfe with his <hi>grand enemies,</hi>
eſpecially the <hi>Queene</hi> whom he had
highly diſobliged: Sometimes to
get the <hi>King's</hi> children to his owne
power and wardſhip; ſometimes to
ruine or at leaſt how to ballance the
<hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Orleans;</hi> and ſometimes to
retire, for which purpoſe he had
layed up a vaſt ſumme of readie gold
at <hi>Haure de Grace,</hi> and had purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in the <hi>King's</hi> name and licence,
but with his owne mony, A ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rainty
on the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> with <hi>Chaſtean
Reynaud,</hi> and a territory adjacent,
whereby he doubted not but to
render himſelfe conſiderable both to
<hi>France</hi> and the <hi>neighbour Princes,</hi>
without any feare of his enemies.
But all this was in vaine, for death
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:115788:11"/>
tooke him at the beſt time, at the
bound of his glory, The newes of
the taking of <hi>Tortona</hi> in the ſtate
of <hi>Milan</hi> coming to <hi>Paris</hi> the
ſame day to bring new Laurells to
his hearſe. But when he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to die, he may ſeeme to have
over-reached his fortune, and driven
her beyond her intention, in leaving
her favours to his ſucceſſors in a
way ſcarce before obſerved: for
beſides his leaving a <hi>creature</hi> of his
owne to ſurvive in; he bequeathed
the moſt important charges of the
<hi>Kingdome</hi> under the <hi>King's</hi> good
pleaſure (who accordingly allowed
of his diſpoſall in all; but a few
church livings, and that only to
ſave the prerogative which the
<hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>France</hi> claime in ſuch cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes)
to his owne kindred: which
proved a great diſappointment to
his enemies, for they ſoone found
that they could not pluck up his
reſidue without the danger of the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:115788:11"/>
whole. Then he recommended
to the <hi>King</hi> the <hi>Officers</hi> and <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi>
of ſtate as he was to leave them,
particularly the <hi>Secretaries</hi> de <hi>Chau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigny</hi>
and de <hi>Noyers,</hi> wherein he
promiſed his majeſty, he might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
to proſper as he had thither to.
The <hi>King</hi> accepts well of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
reſolves to uſe the ſame inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that he had before: but never
to admit the like partager in his
<hi>royall authority,</hi> as the <hi>Cardinall</hi>
of <hi>Richelieu</hi> had been. For the
<hi>Cardinall Mazzarini</hi> he forth with
makes him preſident of his councell,
committing the <hi>Secretaries</hi> of ſtate
to his orders, which in effect was
to make him his <hi>prime Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My purpoſe is to digeſt ſome
<hi>memorialls</hi> from this period: yet I
cannot leave that great ſubject
(before mentioned) till I have
brought him to his funerall. Not
that I intend any long digreſſion
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:115788:12"/>
to bring in the Ceremonies of his
interring: but only to note one or
two circumſtances on this occaſion,
which have reſpect to ſome enſuing
paſſages. The firſt was the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
of an ancient difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
<hi>Cardinalls</hi> and the <hi>Princes</hi>
of the <hi>blood</hi> about precedencie,
which before was only regulated
by the <hi>Kings</hi> favour. Now they
agree with mutuall ſatisfaction, that
in the Churches and Eccleſiaſticall
functions, the <hi>Cardinall</hi> ſhould have
priority; in other places the <hi>Princes;</hi>
and in other things ſhould treat
one another with equality: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Condè</hi> and his
ſonne the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Enguien</hi> come to
viſit the <hi>Cardinall Mazzarini.</hi> The
ſecond is this; There was a chaire
covered with velvet and ſomewhat
raiſed, ſet for the <hi>Cardinall Mazza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini</hi>
in the church of <hi>Noſtre-dame</hi>
in <hi>Paris,</hi> where the obſequies were
to be ſolemnized, which occaſioned
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:115788:12"/>
a hot diſpute about the manner of
being ſeated, betwixt the ſaid <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi>
and the <hi>Biſhops;</hi> theſe pretending
that he ſhould ſtand in the ſame
ranke with them; and among theſe
the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Rheims</hi> and
<hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Beauvais</hi> were moſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt,
breaking out into high words,
in ſaying, That with other <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls</hi>
for dignity, birth, and merit
more regardable then he, there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
fell the like pretenſion. This
offence the <hi>Cardinall</hi> was faine to
digeſt at that time, not without
ſtraining a diſſimulation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but found
opportunity afterwards to turne
it on the authors, to a greater jacture
of their reputation. <hi>Richelieu</hi> is
now covered, the court is ſoone fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with ſuch as had fled or retired:
The new <hi>Miniſters</hi> are as diligent
to make new friends, ſueing for
ſome that were proſcribed the
court (among whome <hi>Monſieur</hi>
de <hi>Baradas,</hi> and the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>St Simon</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:115788:13"/>
who had beene both favourites and
afterwards diſgraced, were graciouſly

                  <body>
                     <p>LOVIS, by the grace of <hi>God, King</hi>
of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Navarre;</hi> To all
to whom the preſent letters ſhall
come, greeting. When we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in what manner our moſt deare
and beloved only Brother the
<hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Orleans,</hi> hath behaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:115788:14"/>
towards us, we cannot without
wonder reflect on all the enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
which he hath undertaken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
our Service. We may ſay
in truth that, never was any ſon of
<hi>France</hi> charged with ſo great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
by the <hi>King</hi> his brother, and
who hath leſſe acknowledged them.
Our love hath alwaies beene ſo
great towards his <hi>Perſon,</hi> that his
ingratitude hath not beene able
to make us change the purpoſe
that we have had to ingratiate him;
inſomuch that at the ſame time
when he has ſet himſelfe againſt our
ſervice, we have continually ſought
to reduce him, not omitting any
meanes to oblige him thereunto.
But all theſe good offices which
ſhould have beene as ſo many cords
to bind him to us the more ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
have not proved ſtrong enough
to hinder him from joyning with
our feirceſt enemies, and advancing
their deſignes. The Conſpiracies
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:115788:15"/>
of <hi>Chales</hi> wrought under his name
and with his conſent in the yeare
1626 gave us the firſt experiment
of his ill will. He incited our <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin</hi>
the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Eſpernon</hi> againſt
our ſervice to ſeize himſelfe of the
City and Citadell of <hi>Metz,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we uſed ſuch bounty that we
were willing to forget that failing,
contenting our ſelves to puniſh only
the delinquency of <hi>Chales.</hi> When
we were obliged to go into <hi>Piemont</hi>
to the ſuccour of our <hi>confederats,</hi>
where the onely appearing of our
armes ſecured their peace, we were
no ſooner returning from this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition,
but he ſevered himſelfe
from us, retiring in the yeare 1629
without occaſion to the <hi>Duke Charles</hi>
of <hi>Lorraine.</hi> Although this acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſo extravagant in a time when
all <hi>France</hi> and our allies expreſſed
their reſentments for the happy
ſucceſſe of our journey, gave us
great occaſion of diſguſt towards
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:115788:15"/>
him: yet covering his failings,
we did not ceaſe to make him
way to returne to us, changing the
chaſtiſements which he deſerved
into ſo manie favours which we
did him, augmenting his <hi>appanages,</hi>
and giving him the government of
<hi>Orleans</hi> and <hi>Amboyſe:</hi> However
ſo favourable entertainement might
have obliged him to reunite inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
to our intereſts; nevertheleſſe
a while after he departs from <hi>Paris,</hi>
returning to <hi>Orleans,</hi> and in ſuite to
<hi>Lorrain</hi> in the yeare 1631, where
wounding the fundamentall Lawes
of our ſtate he married himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
our will to the ſiſter of <hi>Duke
Charles,</hi> which marriage being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed
he flies to <hi>Bruſſells</hi> in the
yeare 1632, putting himſelfe in the
power of our enemies, who induced
him to enter hoſtilely armed into
our <hi>Kingdome,</hi> to joyne himſelfe in
<hi>Languedoc</hi> to the forces of a faction
which he had formed with the <hi>Duke</hi>
                        <pb n="20" facs="tcp:115788:16"/>
of <hi>Monmorency,</hi> which faction being
then diſperſed and broken by our
armes, we received him the third
time into our grace. We thought
that our aforeſaid <hi>Brother,</hi> being affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
with ſo many tokens of our
good will, would at laſt apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to the reſolution of holding to
his duty; but we had ſcarce abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<hi>Languedoc</hi> to returne to <hi>Paris,</hi>
ere he went the third time out of
our State, and ligued himſelfe anew
with the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> taking his
part againſt us. In which appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
his ill will by ſo much the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
in that he had not ſought or
received our grace at <hi>Beſie<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>es,</hi> but to
be able to abuſe it the more eaſily,
by removing thoſe obſtacles, that
(without this) would have beene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable
to him in the paſſage by
him premeditated, and reſolved into
<hi>Flanders.</hi> This bad carriage did
not hinder in the leaſt, but that,
when he withdrew himſelfe from
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:115788:16"/>
the ill treatment of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
reſolving to ſet himſelfe at liberty
by returning to our perſon, with
intention to acknowledg his fault,
we ſhould againe freely pardon him
the fourth time. A litle while
after, having notice given us in
<hi>France</hi> that his actions were not
ſuch as we might deſire, and that he
followed the pernicious counſells
of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Puy-Laurens,</hi> wee
became neceſſitated, to prevent
a greater evill, to cauſe the aforeſaid
Duke to be arreſted, to obliege the
more our ſaid <hi>Brother</hi> to unite him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
the more ſtrictly with us, and
to render us the honour and the
ſervice which is due to us. We
did him in this reſpect all the good
offices which he could expect from
our affection, even to honour him
with the command of the moſt flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing
and numerous armie which
of a long time hath beene ſeene in
our <hi>Kingdome.</hi> Inſtead of condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:115788:17"/>
our forces ſo vigorouſly as he
might have done againſt the armies
of our enemies, which had ſurpriſed
a fortreſſe on our frontier of <hi>Picardy;</hi>
the ſuggeſtion of the <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Soiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi>
and of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Valette</hi> had
ſo much power over him, that they
plotted together to employ them
againſt our ſelves. But being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
from that pernicious deſigne
by the notice which they had, that
they could never ſo diſpoſe of the
ſoldiery, the ſaid <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Soiſſons</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires
to <hi>Sedan,</hi> and our foreſaid <hi>bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
to <hi>Blois</hi> in the yeare 1636, with
intention to paſſe thence into <hi>Cui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne.</hi>
We purſued him thence to
<hi>Orleans,</hi> where he giving us to
underſtand the diſpleaſure which he
had taken in agreeing to ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes,
obtained from us the fifth
pardon for this fault, with the ſame
facility as the reſt. In vertue of
this laſt grace as his actions in the
courſe of ſome yeares paſt had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:115788:17"/>
us to believe that he would
be far from lending eare any more
for the future to ſuch councells as
he had before harkened to, we
readily condeſcended, as we had
done on divers occaſions, to graunt
him all effects that he might poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
expect from our goodneſſe.
The opinion therefore which we
had conceaved of his good diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
cleared us of all doubt to have
ſeene him in the laſt Campagne at
<hi>Rouſſyllon.</hi> But notwithſtanding
ſome promiſe given us, he prolonged
the execution, under various excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
which made us judge that he
was contriving ſome ill deſigne.
And when we were travailing to
diſcover it, <hi>God</hi> vouchſafed us the
favour to inlighten us about the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable
conſpiracy, which had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
a powerfull party in our <hi>ſtate,</hi>
and eſtabliſhed a treaty with <hi>Spain</hi>
Tis true that we remained greatly
amazed that our foreſaid <hi>Brother</hi>
                        <pb n="24" facs="tcp:115788:18"/>
the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Orleans,</hi> from whom we
might have expected all manner of
aſſiſtance for the ſuſtenance of the
proſperity of our armes, ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
to uphold our enemies, and
put himſelfe in the head of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
to enter on our <hi>State,</hi> while we
were employed in a great ſeige.
We were then moſt intimately
affected to ſee that neither the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
benefits, nor graces,
which we had on divers occaſions
granted him with ſuch bounty,
nor the love of his Country, nor the
glory of a <hi>Crowne,</hi> in the intereſts
whereof he hath ſo great a part by
his birth; could retaine him in
his duty, and that he would rather,
by violating all theſe ſacred reſpects,
purſue an unjuſt paſſion to raiſe the
grandeur of our enemies upon the
ruines of our owne. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment
notwithſtanding which
we were to have of ſuch and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
offences did nothing hinder; but
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:115788:18"/>
(as ſoone as our foreſaid <hi>Brother</hi> did
acknowledge and confeſſe his fault,
with promiſe for the future to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
farre from his Perſon all ſuch
malignant ſpirits, and thoſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
which we nominated) we did
what poſſibly in us lay, to draw
him from the perill wherein
he had precipitated himſelfe. We
contented our ſelves to puniſh only
two of the principall authors of the
crime, agreeing for this time alſo, to
reject any memory of his ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.</p>
                     <p>But as Nature hath given us theſe
good inclinations, and made us ſecond
them with advantageous dealings;
ſo we judge that theſe favours are
to be regulated with the good of
our <hi>Crowne,</hi> and the intereſt of our
<hi>Children.</hi> Theſe motives have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
us, that it was of neceſſary
conſequence to take from our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
<hi>Brother</hi> thoſe means, which might
for the future lead him to diſturbe the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:115788:19"/>
peace of our <hi>State,</hi> ſuppreſſing his
companies of men at Armes, and
Light-Horſes; and depriving him, at
the preſent, of the Government of
<hi>Auvergne,</hi> wherewith we had grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
him; and for the future of all
ſort of adminiſtration in this <hi>State,</hi>
and eſpecially in the <hi>Regencie,</hi> during
the <hi>minority</hi> of our children, in caſe
<hi>God</hi> ſhould call us to himſelfe before
the yeares of their <hi>majority:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
we are moved with ſo much the
juſter reaſon, foraſmuch as it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to apprehend otherwiſe,
then the continuing of bad intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of a perſon that (in the middle
of our proſperities, and in the
ſtrength of our power, in a time
when all our ſubjects do conſpire in
one vote for the goodiſſue of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes)
hath ſollicited the <hi>King</hi> of
<hi>Spain</hi> to furniſh him with forces and
monies to make warre upon us, and
on condition to make no treaty with
us, without remitting into our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:115788:19"/>
hands, all the fortreſſes gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from them, or acquired by Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
our confederates. And in effect,
if the perillous ſtate, whereinto a
grievous infirmity hath brought us,
during this <hi>Campagne,</hi> hath not at
all touched his Heart, as we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
to the contrary, by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of the complices of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy,
that he hath aſſured a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne
to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> after our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe,
beſides the party which he
could make in our <hi>State,</hi> that he had
fortified himſelf with other <hi>Forreign</hi>
correſpondences; we ſhould be needs
inſenſible of the good of our Realm,
which is more dear to us then our
life, not to feare and fore-ſee, that if

In purſuance of theſe his reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

which being now out of

a more remiſſe hand (as the more

now the two emulous <hi>Monarchies</hi>
were counterpoiſed only by a reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procall

and referring their diſpatch

and thereupon to diſcover ſome

in the perſon of <hi>D. Lewis</hi> de <hi>Haró</hi>

the preſent <hi>Vice-roy</hi> of <hi>Naples</hi>) who
beginning his courſe almoſt as ſoon,
(and without any oppoſition) as his

               <p>In the interim the armes of both
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:115788:24"/>
nations are not idle, and the ſuite
of thoſe councils, which had iſſued
from their late <hi>Dictators</hi> (ſubjects
both of them of extraordinary fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes)
though interciſed from their
heads; yet run out their courſes: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
in the two <hi>Republicks</hi> of
<hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> which were high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be courted at this time. Of
the firſt of which we have ſomewhat
ready to inſert here.</p>
               <p>There had happened lately in
<hi>Italy</hi> a war meerely <hi>Italian,</hi> neither
<hi>French</hi> nor <hi>Spaniſh</hi> having any hand
in it, nor knowing how to intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
in it, though they ſought many
waies to inultratetheir practiſes about
the Quarrell. A war it was not
very violent; but full of expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
in the managing, in the treating,
and in compoſing of it, the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was the ſeizing of the <hi>Dutchy</hi> of
<hi>Caſtro</hi> (a place lying conveniently
near to <hi>Rome,</hi> and bordering upon
the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Florence</hi> his dominions,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:115788:24"/>
but belonging to the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Parma</hi>)
by the Nephewes of <hi>Urban</hi> the <hi>eight,</hi>
pretending to ſatisfy the Montiſts in
<hi>Rome,</hi> to whom that <hi>Prince</hi> was much
indebted: the <hi>Republick</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi>
the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Florence,</hi> and the <hi>Duke</hi>
of <hi>Modena,</hi> as Freinds and Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
to the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Parma,</hi> or as
jealous of the <hi>Eccleſiaſticall State</hi>
ſince the accruing of the new eſtates
of <hi>Urbino</hi> and <hi>Ferrara,</hi> or as no well
wiſhers to the <hi>Barberini,</hi> ligue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
to aid and reſtore the
ſaid <hi>Duke</hi> to his ſequeſtred <hi>Dutchy:</hi>
the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> hold
themſelves a while Spectators, as
if they were to ſtudy their intereſts in
this emergent, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> for
the hate they bare the <hi>Barberini,</hi>
and for the love which they ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hugged of the <hi>Pope's</hi> trouble,
could well have bin contented with
the war, but that they equally hated
the progreſſe of the league, their jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Neighbours, whom they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:115788:25"/>
to over-awe, wherefore when the
<hi>Pope</hi> was very Importunate by his
<hi>Nuntio Panziroli</hi> at <hi>Madrid</hi> to get
that <hi>King</hi> to Joyne with the <hi>Pope,</hi>
and to declare himſelfe againſt the
league, as alſo to ſupply him with
the ſuccours of 900 horſe and 3000
foot, which the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> is
bound to furniſh the <hi>Pope</hi> withall,
when his eſtates are invaded, by
vertue of his Fief of <hi>Naples,</hi> the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi>
returned but formall anſwers,
as expreſſing his thought to be that
the reſtitution of <hi>Caſtro</hi> was but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable;
and this no occaſion for him
to aid the <hi>Pope</hi> (to the prejudice of
the League) conſidering that he was
the invader, rather than invaded:
for the <hi>Spaniard</hi> well knew that by
declaring for one ſide he ſhould but
give the <hi>French</hi> occaſion to take
the other, and ſo draw the greater
prejudice on his own eſtates, giving
them the more pretenſions to
invade him. So that all conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:115788:25"/>
he was not unwilling to carry
himſelfe only as an arbitrator, and
not permit the <hi>French</hi> to get the
ſtart of him in the management.
Yet he ſuffers the <hi>Switzers,</hi> which
the <hi>Pope</hi> had levied for the war, to
paſſe through the <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Milan,</hi> as
a counterbalance to the league, and
not long after he alſo granted the
ſame liberty to other forces of the
<hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Parma's,</hi> as a like counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiſe
to the <hi>Papalins,</hi> which he
thought might well conſiſt with
his publick indifferency: for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
he had a ſecret grudging againſt
the League; alſo being his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<hi>Princes,</hi> and leſs potent that
had formed an union without his
knowledg, conſent, or comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
it inwardly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> diſpleaſing him
that the <hi>Princes</hi> of <hi>Italy</hi> ſhould ſhew
to act independently of his Crown; a
thought ſo much the harder to be
digeſted in that it might be thence
gathered that ſuch reſolutions were
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:115788:26"/>
taken upon a ground of weakneſſe
and decay of his greatneſſe, while
in ſpite of their bad fortune the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
ſtill deſired to treat and to be
treated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as when they were at the
higheſt aſcendent of their felicity.
And if now a war being broken out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it
ſhould be again compoſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his arbitration, as umpire of the
affairs of <hi>Italy,</hi> or the <hi>French</hi> out
ſtrip him in this negotiation,
he would be a great deal worſe to
like it. But I will not follow theſe
comments any further.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> were yet more buſy
and more ſubtle to handle and wind
themſelves into theſe treaties, ſo
that it is not ſo eaſy to penetrate
their true deſignes, I will therefore
be a little more punctuall and more
large on this point as a part of my
ſet purpoſe, for the ſake of which I
have brought in any thing of the
contrary to illuſtrate it: nor do I
regard any other art or method then
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:115788:26"/>
what directly ſerves the nature of
of the things themſelves which
I am treating.</p>
               <p>Preſently after the ſeizing of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtro,</hi>
the <hi>Marqueſſe</hi> of <hi>Fontenay</hi> is
appointed <hi>Ambaſſadour</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> to
accomodate this difference, with or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to <hi>Cardinall Bichitill</hi> he ſhould
come, to apply himſelfe earneſtly in
this matter to the <hi>Pope</hi> and his <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews,</hi>
which as a preparative might
ſerve to farther negotiation. 'Twas
about the beginning of November
1641 when <hi>Fontenay</hi> arrived: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the adjuſting of the buſineſs
of Parma, being alſo encharged to
endeavour the reception of the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of Lamego Ambaſsadour</hi> from
the new <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Portugall,</hi> Shich
the <hi>Pope</hi> made many excuſes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
as a point involved with other
intereſts nothing perfunctory: with
it highly concerned the obliging or
diſobliging of the two <hi>Crowns</hi> for
the reſtitution of <hi>Caſtro</hi> and other
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:115788:27"/>
goods to the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Parma:</hi> the
<hi>Ambaſsadour</hi> makes great inſtances
with the <hi>Pope,</hi> alleaging him to be
under his <hi>Majeſtie's</hi> protection, with
many proteſtations that he could not
abandon him: but the <hi>Pope</hi> ſtill
inſiſted on the obedience and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation
of <hi>Parma</hi> to him, as his ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne,
in his own perſon, and not
by another's interpoſall to capitulate
with him, he being a <hi>Feudatary</hi> of
the <hi>Holy See;</hi> whereupon notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the <hi>Barberini</hi> (which had
hitherto greatly countergrained the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> by their partiality to the
<hi>French</hi>) thought it now time to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
ſome complyancwith them, &amp; if
need were to come over to their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
in reference whereunto they
practiſe at the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> by
their <hi>Nuntio Facchinetti</hi> a conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
with them to oppreſſe the
<hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Parma,</hi> as a Partiſan of the
<hi>French,</hi> and a complotter of deſigns
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:115788:27"/>
on the ſtate of <hi>Milan,</hi> not omitting at
the ſame time to treat on other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
to the ſame drift at the court
of <hi>France,</hi> and according to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riableneſſe
of their deſigns with the
anſwerableneſſe of either party; ſo
they carried towards the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of
<hi>Lamego:</hi> but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> finding
(when they had once well ſetled
themſelves to hold the <hi>State</hi> of
<hi>Caſtro,</hi> wherein they expected no
ſuch oppoſition as they afterwards
met withall) that the former trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
ſoon cooled; they ſought rather
to ſecure themſelves by modelling
the intentions of the <hi>Duke,</hi> preſſing
reiterated promiſes from him, that
he would not call the <hi>French</hi> to his
ſuccour, nor accept of their aids while
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would ſupport him:
but whatſoever point it was that
failed, the beſt aſſiſtance which the
<hi>Duke</hi> had afterwards was by the men
and mony that came from <hi>France.</hi>

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:115788:28"/>

(Not obſerving the cenſures) to
hold at their <hi>Duke's</hi> Devotion, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
he to employ their reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
in his war, which would have a-amounted
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:115788:29"/>
to a great ſum (I will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
a little further here, though
ſomewhat below the times which I
intended to reſume) Being after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
brought to the feet of his <hi>Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
&amp; there rendred the accuſtomed
moſt humble reverence, he preſents
to him the credentiall letter of the

and efficacious inſtances, he
beſeecheth him that qualifying thoſe
diſguſts that he had conceived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Parma,</hi> he would
be graciouſly pleaſed to reſtore him
to his former good grace; and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
him with paternall benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
condeſcend to ſome agreement
to their reciprocall ſatisfaction,
which courteous expreſſions being
anſwered by the <hi>Pope</hi> in words te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying
a very reall acceptation;
<hi>Monſieur</hi> de <hi>Lyonne</hi> proceeds to
a further diſcourſe, importing that it
was his <hi>Majeſty's</hi> earneſt deſire and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:115788:29"/>
requeſt to his <hi>Holyneſſe</hi> to Reſtore
the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Parma</hi> to all his goods
and eſtates, ſince he had ſo amply ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
his reputation in the conqueſt
of <hi>Caſtro,</hi> and now to forget things
paſt, as his <hi>Majeſty</hi> himſelfe had
dealt with the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lorrain</hi>
in reſtoring him to aſtate of ſuch
advantage upon his humble ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
only to his <hi>Majeſty's</hi> clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
To this the <hi>Pope</hi> anſwered in
theſe preciſe tearms, <hi>Caſtro</hi> is already
the <hi>Apoſtolicall See's.</hi> There is
nothing to be ſaid of that.</p>
               <p>If you will treat of <hi>Parma</hi> and
<hi>Placentia</hi> [which were now preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to be forfeited] ſomewhat may
be done at the <hi>Kings</hi> interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
About <hi>Caſtro</hi> we will afterwards
do juſtice. <hi>Monſieur</hi> de <hi>Lyonne</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies,
that, that was not the grace
which his <hi>Majeſty</hi> had employed
him to ſeek, it being probable that
the neighbour <hi>Princes</hi> would not
ſuffer ſuch diſaſter to befall the <hi>Duke</hi>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:115788:30"/>
of <hi>Parma,</hi> nor ſuch an acquiſition to
a mightier confinant as was the
<hi>State Eccleſiaſticall;</hi> where the <hi>Pope</hi>
apprehending a ſecret conceipt ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
that the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France</hi>
would aid the <hi>Parmeſan,</hi> diſcovered
great alteration, ſaying that the
<hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Parma</hi> was a rebell and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated,
and that whatſoever
<hi>Princes</hi> ſhould aſſiſt him were wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cked
and Impious, in which caſe
he would put his truſt in God aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
himſelfe that he would not aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
him in his moſt righteous cauſe;
That therefore he ſhould not ſpeak
any more to him about <hi>Caſtro,</hi> as a
buſineſſe not practicable, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of <hi>Parma,</hi> and <hi>Placentia:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
<hi>de Lyonne</hi> not troubling himſelfe
replyed; That if his <hi>Holyneſſe</hi>
would do any grace to the <hi>King,</hi> it
muſt be about <hi>Caſtro,</hi> for of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he had no commiſſion to treat
any thing: which more inflaming
the <hi>Pope's</hi> diſpleaſure, he tooke his
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:115788:30"/>
leave in time, that he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
his further application for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
audience, which a while after
he again obtaining with like ſucceſſe,
tooke his courſe back to <hi>Parma</hi> to
propound new overtures. The
<hi>French</hi> having bin before dealing
with the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Parma</hi> to draw
his aſſiſtance towards <hi>Lombardy,</hi> were
now willing to degage him from
any embroilments on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſide, or otherwiſe to ſtudy how to
ſerve themſelves upon occaſion.
The <hi>Spaniards</hi> though they longed to
revenge the injuries of the <hi>Barberini</hi>
were fain to mortify that paſſion
with better councell, holding it
no good time to break with <hi>Rome,</hi>
any more then to joine with <hi>Parma.</hi>
The <hi>Republick</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> The <hi>Duke</hi>
of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> The <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Modena</hi>
(being both allied in blood to <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi>)
are yet but making long debates
about a league in his favour: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>De Lyonne</hi> thinks beſt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:115788:31"/>
ſome ſuſpenſion for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
fearing leaſt <hi>Parma</hi> ſhould
be over-powred, which he being a
<hi>Prince</hi> of great Courage, and now
if he followed not his enterpriſes
likely to ſink under great charges,
which the forces that he had gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
muſt needs put him to in his own
countrey, was very unwilling to
hearken to: ſo that entring with his
forces into the eccleſiaſticall ſtate
he brought great dammages &amp; ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
to <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelfe, till at laſt he was
overperſwaded to attend the iſſue
of a treaty at <hi>Caſtel-Georgio,</hi> wherein
the <hi>Papalins</hi> to divert the preſent
ſhock conſented to depoſite <hi>Caſtro</hi>
in the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Modena's</hi> hands for
three or four months, while affairs in
difference ſhould be treated, The
<hi>Miniſters</hi> of <hi>France</hi> being all this
while inſtant with the <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi>
firſt to mediate for, and then
to aſſiſt the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Parma,</hi> practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
alſo at the ſame time with other
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:115788:31"/>
                  <hi>Italian Princes</hi> on this ſubject, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
avoid jealouſies on all ſides
interchangeable. The <hi>Venetians</hi>
(though moved thereunto by the
<hi>French Miniſters</hi> yet) are very
cautious how they interpoſe their
offices in this affaire, leaſt they ſhould
ſeem to deprive that <hi>Crown</hi> of the
Honour of mediation, whereupon
they impart all their negotiations
at <hi>Rome</hi> with exact diligence to the
<hi>French Ambaſsadour,</hi> paſſing one
concurrence and correſpondence in
their treaties: But for the matter
of aſſiſtance, however they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to the joyning with their
Neighbour Potentates to keep <hi>Italy</hi>
ſtill in the ſame Ballance; yet the
inſtances of the <hi>French</hi> in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
they accounted no way free
from ſuſpicion; now eſpecially that
the <hi>Princes</hi> of <hi>Savoy</hi> were turned to
their ſervice and away thereby ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to the heart of <hi>Lombardy:</hi>
They hold the old proverb good,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:115788:32"/>
Have the <hi>French</hi> for thy Friend,
but not for thy Neighbour. For
although they had the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
ambitious and troubleſome Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
which by their monies and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
had made them many
chargable and unſeaſonable diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
yet the differences ſince a whole
age had never come to a breach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, beſids that, they did not
count them of ſo deſultory an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
as other <hi>Ultramontans.</hi> On
another ſide the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſeeing
the French ſo buſy in their treaties
from the one ſide to the other, and
knowing how much they were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieged
to reſpect them both; now
they ſaw alſo the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Parma</hi>
proceed ſo proſperouſly in the ſtate
Eccleſiaſticall without foot or artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
began to confirme themſelves in a
former ſuſpicion, that ſome myſtery
was under thoſe enterpriſes, and that
the <hi>Pope</hi> was indeed of ſome agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Parma,</hi> the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:115788:32"/>
                  <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France</hi> and the <hi>Princes</hi> of
the <hi>League,</hi> againſt the <hi>Kingdome</hi>
of <hi>Naples,</hi> whoſe <hi>Vice-roy</hi> was allied
to That <hi>Duke;</hi> which apprehenſion
might have bin the more juſtified
by an overture of <hi>Monſieur De Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onne</hi>
(if at leaſt it did not eſcape the
inquiſitiveneſſe of the <hi>Spaniards</hi>)
made to the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Parma,</hi> about
the leaving of <hi>Caſtro</hi> to <hi>Don Tadco,</hi>
and accepting of the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>King</hi>
of <hi>France</hi> his aſſiſtance to inveſt him
in the <hi>Kingdome</hi> of <hi>Naples:</hi> To
which the <hi>Duke</hi> roundly anſwered,
Nay, but rather let them reſtore me
my <hi>Dutchy,</hi> and beſtow their <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi>
on <hi>Don Tadco.</hi> However this
conceipt, eſpecially the League be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now formed, and his Neighbours
in armes round about him, made the
<hi>Spaniard</hi> keep him on his guard, to
his great charges, and leave thoſe
forces on his frontiers of <hi>Naples</hi>
which he needed elſwhere: being
alſo (as before was intimated) not
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:115788:33"/>
a litle troubled at ſuch a league made
with his excluſion. The <hi>Pope</hi> and
the <hi>Barberini</hi> are no leſſe ſatisfied
of the <hi>French</hi> Negotiations as too
too partiall to the intereſts of <hi>Parma,</hi>
and otherwiſe ſuſpected to aime on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
at embroiling all things. The
other <hi>Princes</hi> are jealous of the
<hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Parma,</hi> leaſt he ſhould be
brought to caſt himſelfe onely on
the <hi>French</hi> aſſiſtance, and to bring a
formidable gueſt to their doores;
whereupon they are willing rather
to aſſiſt him themſelves, that he
might enter on no courſe prejudiciall
to their common Intereſts: And ſo
at laſt concluding and conjoyning
in one league, rendred no leſſe jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy
to the <hi>French</hi> themſelves
then they had done to the others,
leaſt it ſhould tend to contravene
their deſignes now ready againſt the
<hi>State</hi> of <hi>Milan.</hi> But let us now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
to the <hi>Court,</hi> and thence take

We left the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Orleans</hi> a
moneth ſince ſhadowed with a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall,
and thick cloud: but as
mighty offices were not wanting to
diſpell it: particularly of the <hi>Secretary</hi>
de <hi>Chauvigni,</hi> a creature of the late
<hi>Cardinall,</hi> and ſpeciall Confident
of the preſent. Whereupon on
the 12th of <hi>January,</hi> he arrives at
<hi>Paris,</hi> and next morning preſents
himſelfe to the King in his Cabinet,
at St <hi>Germans,</hi> with one knee on
the ground, in expreſſion of
reverence, and humiliation, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting
hereafter never to deviate
from that loyaltie which on ſo many
reſpects he owed to his Majeſty:
from whom he had this anſwer.
<hi>That it was now high time the effects
ſhould agree in perfect harmony with
his words: in which caſe he might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
the fruits of a loving brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
knowing that he could not from
any other hand, then that of his royall
bounty, hope for any advantage.</hi>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:115788:34"/>
The King had reaſon, conſidering
his owne health, and the high inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt's
of the perſon, not to leave
him in ſuch diſguſts, as were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to fall heavy on his Infant-ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor.
But Monſieur to uſe this

diſpatched their Deputies to the

The <hi>Governour Margarita</hi>

when the <hi>Biſhop</hi> made anſwer ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,

The <hi>Catalonians</hi> in another caſe
ſhewed not only diſguſt, but ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion:
for when the <hi>French</hi> were
treating with them of raiſing a <hi>Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>royall</hi>
on a hill, which ſtood too near
to prejudice their <hi>city</hi> of <hi>Barcelona,</hi>
perſwading them to demoliſh their
imperfect fortifications, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
built without art might ſerve,
it may be, to offend more then to
defend them, and in purſuance
of theſe councells brought an <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineer</hi>
to deſigne the form of it:
they endeavoured not only to
throw Jealouſy on this action, but
openly ſhewed ſo reſolute a repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy,
as obliged the <hi>Kings Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi>
to ſurceaſe in it. And the
<hi>Magiſtrates</hi> of <hi>Barcelona</hi> levelled
the old works, leaving only an
ancient tower which ſerved for a
<hi>Pharos</hi> on the Sea-ſide.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile the <hi>Spaniards</hi> imploy
ſuch forces as they had under the
banner of the <hi>Marqueſſe</hi> of <hi>Inoijoſa</hi>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:115788:39"/>
about five thouſand foot, and five
hundred horſe to take up their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
within the territory of the

ſuch ſucceſſe, that they were like
to recover all that tract lying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Eber,</hi> and <hi>Arragon.</hi>
From thence he accoſteth the
a place belonging to the <hi>Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
of <hi>Barcellona,</hi> but a ſudden
riſing of the waters obligeth him
to diſlodge, bringing great damage
upon the country, whereupon he
turns his courſe to <hi>Mirave,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
that town with a thouſand horſe
and an hundred foot, planting his
batteries againſt the <hi>Caſtle</hi> which he
had brought almoſt to tearms,
when the <hi>Marſhall</hi> de la <hi>Mothe</hi> on a
ſudden paſſeth the <hi>Eber,</hi> and arrives
with a ſtrong brigade to their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour,
enters the place without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,
and finds means to caſt in a
recruit of eight hundred men, which
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:115788:39"/>
not at all delaying to ſally out on
their Aſſaylers, while the <hi>Marſhall</hi>
inveſted them on all ſides there
enſued an hardy conflict for about
three houres, but at laſt the <hi>Caſtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
were fain to leave the field to
their enemies, with the death of
ſome hundreds, and priſe of four
hundred more. But the loſſe of
the <hi>French</hi> was ſo conſiderable,
that it imbittered the victory.
The <hi>Marqueſſe</hi> of <hi>Inoijoſa</hi> being then
at <hi>Gandeſa,</hi> ſolliciting Cannon, and
proviſions (not ſuſpecting that <hi>La
Mothe</hi> could paſſe the river ſo ſoone,
which he had left ſo high and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous

to aid his men with the reſt of his

<hi>Tortoſa</hi> and then leaving <hi>Flix,</hi> and

               <p>This fate of <hi>Inoijoſa</hi> was ſadly
reſented in <hi>Spain,</hi> fearing leſt the
reſidue of their forces ſhould ſcarce
ſuffice to hinder excurſions into

<hi>King</hi> was fain to call two thouſand
<hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>Germans</hi> to theſe parts,
which had beene ſent to the frontiers
of <hi>Portugall:</hi> Nor was this piece of

at the court of <hi>France,</hi> eſpecially
by the <hi>Secretary</hi> de <hi>Noyers</hi> to whom
the <hi>Mareſchal</hi> was allied: ſo that
not omitting ſuch an opportunity, he
never left recommending <hi>La Mothe's</hi>

The <hi>Catalans</hi> did inwardly

not ſet themſelves to expell him,
without bringing a deluge of

ſince the houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> would

Notwithſtanding the <hi>Republick</hi> was

the <hi>Marqueſse,</hi> caſting this Manle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

<hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Caprarola,</hi> a place not far

of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Parma.</hi> His other
pretences were the non-admiſſion

(the Brother of the Cardinall)

gave jealouſy at <hi>Rome</hi> of ſome my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious

But when the diſpatches of <hi>Fonte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay</hi>
came to the <hi>Court</hi> with account
of his departure out of <hi>Rome</hi> and
the motives of it, the <hi>King</hi> ſend's
for the <hi>Nuntio,</hi> and with much effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
complain's of the <hi>Pope's</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings

of <hi>Caſtel-Georgio</hi> and deluding
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:115788:49"/>

of the partiality of <hi>Cardinall Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berino</hi>
to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> with the
injuries he had done his <hi>Royall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi>
and interpoſition, whereupon
he counted himſelfe engaged in his
reputation to uſe all means to
bring that treaty to effect. The
<hi>Nuntio</hi> ſet himſelfe to excuſe the
Actions of <hi>Rome,</hi> beſeeching
the <hi>King</hi> to ſuſpend his judgment
about the reaſons of his <hi>Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours</hi>
departure, of which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
that yet he had had no notice;
but hoped in a ſhort time to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
of particulars; in the mean
while that he could not admit of
any ill judgment about his <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi>'s
good intentions. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
his <hi>Majeſtie</hi> much reſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
this act of his <hi>Ambaſſadour</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
orders; and as earneſtly deſired
his return to the court; ſo it might
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:115788:50"/>
be without blemiſh to his reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The <hi>Ambaſsadour</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi>
comming not long after to an audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and being advertis'd of theſe
diſſatisfactions, thought it a fit time
for the credit of his <hi>State</hi> to make
proffer of their offices to bring
the <hi>Marqueſſe</hi> of <hi>Fontenay</hi> back with
honour, which he doubted not,
but his <hi>Republick</hi> would endeavour
by all the fair means poſſible.
The <hi>King</hi> hearkned to this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verture,
entreating him to write
effectually to that purpoſe. The
<hi>Nuntio</hi> being alſo adviſed hereof
by the <hi>Ambaſſadour,</hi> promiſed to
ſollicite at the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> that
the good offices of the <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth</hi>
on this behalfe might be
accepted.</p>
               <p>But however, this forwardneſſe
of their <hi>Ambaſſadour,</hi> was not liked
ſo well at <hi>Venice,</hi> till the iſſue it
ſelfe approved it: for at this time
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:115788:50"/>
they themſelves were at no good
Terms at Rome, in being a part of
the <hi>league</hi> againſt the <hi>Barberini,</hi>
though ſtill they continued their
<hi>Miniſters of ſtate</hi> there.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſeeing the <hi>French
Ambaſſadour</hi> gon from his Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
thought it now a time for
them to interpoſe more vigorouſly
to inflame theſe diſguſts, and to
forme an union of the <hi>Princes</hi> of
<hi>Italy</hi> to their <hi>Crown,</hi> as the onely
way to effect the depoſiting of
<hi>Caſtro</hi> in the hands of the <hi>League,</hi>
and exclude the <hi>French</hi> (which
were now become jealous to them,
leſt they ſhould get that depoſiting
into their own hands) from intere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
themſelves any further in this
<hi>Mediation,</hi> the honour whereof they
deſired to carry from them: to this
purpoſe they ſought how to bring
themſelves and the <hi>Pope</hi> within the
<hi>League,</hi> ſo modelling the deſigne
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:115788:51"/>
of it, that they might get the chiefe
arbitration both of the difference,
and depoſition, propounding that
<hi>Caſtro</hi> might be put into the hands
of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Savelli,</hi> the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
Ambaſſadour at Rome,</hi> till
the treatie might be brought
to an iſſue: but the <hi>Pope</hi> and the
ligued <hi>Princes</hi> were too ſenſible to
be drawn by any other motives
than thoſe of their proper Intereſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and the ſuddain recalling to <hi>Rome</hi>
of the <hi>Marqueſſe</hi> of <hi>Fontenay</hi> by the
interceſſions of the offices of <hi>Venice,</hi>
ſet on foot new practiſes, and put
a new luſtre on them, by the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſſe
that enſued on a kind of
reconcilement, between his <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi>
and the moſt <hi>Chriſtian King,</hi>
which was accompanied with the
ſatisfaction of the <hi>Father Mazza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rino,</hi>
in being made <hi>Maſter</hi> of the
<hi>Sacred Palace,</hi> a thing that ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
all imbitterings; for it was
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:115788:51"/>
thought that the cauſe of this <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
was the very motive (how ever
palliated) that made the <hi>Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour</hi>
ſhew ſo high reſentment, to
the end that he might thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratiate
the <hi>Cardinall</hi> his <hi>Brother,</hi>
a matter which yet proved a ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall
to the <hi>Cardinall</hi> in <hi>France,</hi>
that the pretentions of his <hi>Brother</hi>
ſhould hazzard the intereſts of the
<hi>State,</hi> and the amity of the <hi>Pope,</hi>
which alſo gave him diſpleaſure at
them both, uſing his utmoſt pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to recompoſe thoſe differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>Our ſtory begin's now to prey
upon the laſt wiek, the Oyle of the
<hi>Kings</hi> life is 'ee'n exhauſted, the
vaniſhing Flame having long wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
about the brims: But his

as they could within the folds of
their reſpective Robes, whereby
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:115788:52"/>
they could not miſſe of ſome ſuch
Rent, as put <hi>Hortenſius</hi> to a ſuit in
Law, when they encountred one
another in paſſages too ſtrait for
them. The <hi>Parliament</hi> is jealous
of the <hi>Miniſters of State,</hi> and theſe
of the <hi>Princes</hi> of the <hi>Blood,</hi> ſince
they ſaw the <hi>Queen,</hi> the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans,</hi>
and the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde</hi> cloſe
together, and likely to bear before
them the entire management of
affaires, which in all probability
would ruin the Creatures and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendences
of the late <hi>RICHE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIEU,</hi>
that held themſelves yet
at the height of their Fortune in
the <hi>King's</hi> favour. And theſe
apprehenſions wrought ſo intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
with the <hi>Secretary</hi> de <hi>Noyers</hi>
that at laſt it procured his diſmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
For the <hi>King,</hi> now imploying
his beſt thought's, and adviſe with

to His Infant-Heir<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Monſieur</hi> de
<hi>Noyers</hi> was in many points of a

pretending to regulate too much
with His Conceipts (whether by his

eſpecially in the great buſineſſe of
excluding the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Orleans</hi> from

the Perſons of the <hi>Councill:</hi> This
rendered his employment the

which ſtill applyed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to clear his <hi>Majeſtie</hi> of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices
conceiv'd againſt the ſaid

that was likely to enſue upon any
diviſion of the <hi>Royall</hi> houſe. Nor
did it a litle contribute to the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aſide of this Inſtrument, that
he was ſo zealous againſt the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi>
ever traverſing the aids
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:115788:53"/>
of <hi>Germany,</hi> which the <hi>Cardinall
Mazzarini</hi> procured with great
Ardour; as a moſt important in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of the <hi>Crown;</hi> diſcovering
alſo the like averſneſſe to the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guenots,</hi>
inſomuch that it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
he ſhould one day tell the
<hi>Mareſchal</hi> de <hi>Chaſtillon</hi> that when
he was to ſigne any thing in favour
of his Sect, it ſeem'd to him as if
he were to gaſh his own hand:
But above all, His importunacy
with the King was the greateſt
maturer of his downfall, he taking
upon him to uſe (as his <hi>Maſter Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelieu</hi>
had done) and in caſe he
found not that Countenance which
he deſired, to demand retirement;
a thing which the other would do
with great art, knowing the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
which the <hi>King</hi> had of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices:
But of <hi>Noyers</hi> his ill ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
in this way, we may ſee at one
inſtance how he came to knock
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:115788:53"/>
off from his attendance. He had
the office of <hi>Receiver Generall</hi> of
the rate of <hi>Subſiſtance</hi> (an Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
laid at firſt, with exemption
of the payers from quartering of
Souldiers; but ſince made as the
other ordinary <hi>Tallies</hi>) of which he
diſpos'd at his own diſcretion, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
no accompt to any other: It
came to the <hi>King's</hi> eare, that this
<hi>Subſiſtance,</hi> the year before, was
ill diſpenſed, and onely to the
friends, and kindred of the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
<hi>Noyers:</hi> whereupon the <hi>King</hi>
take's occaſion to ask him on what
he had expended thoſe ſums,
which paſſed through his hands
for the ſervice of the War, and of
which he uſed to render no Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt.
(<hi>Tis a certain Revenge
on our own ill humour to think a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe
of Him, that we depend on;
or entertain any Umbrage that he
diſlikes us, or is miſtaken in our
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:115788:54"/>
good intentions, for commonly ſuch
a paſsion is apt to fennow, and ſo to
mantle in its ſowerneſſe, that one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
afterward reſtore it to that Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</hi>)
Noyers, who had either
made, or phancied the <hi>King</hi>'s
Countenance to be not ſo good
as uſually towards Him, tooke
this word for a ſigne of diffidence,
and ſo anſwered that he had ready
in his Cabinet, a Book of all Expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
made by him; and then let him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
laviſh in expreſſions; that
ſince his hard fortune did now
render him ſuſpected, after a ſervice
of ſo many years unintereſſed,
'twere better that his <hi>Majeſty</hi> would
permit him to render his charge to
ſome other, that might be more

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:115788:54"/>
(Twas thought that <hi>Noyers</hi> was
the more bold in venting this
Paſſion, preſuming that his two

ſecure Him from having

from the <hi>King's</hi> bed, and
then from his Chamber, perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
him to conſider, and not to
precipitate with himſelfe, but give
way to his <hi>Majeſtie's</hi> anger for the
time; which ſome interpreted as
the act of a true Friend, but others
as the Ruſe of a <hi>Courtier</hi> to draw
him from the <hi>King,</hi> and ſo from
all hope of accomodation: for

at ſeverall times treated with the
<hi>King,</hi> of ſuch matters, as de <hi>Noyers</hi>

Contrary. Which things if reall
(as they have a great ſhew of truth)
one would think, by de <hi>Noyers</hi>'s

were no leſs reall then pretended
to retire to his privacy: He goe's

demand his Licence in perſon of
the <hi>King,</hi> or by another: who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
many fair offices to perſwade
with him, at laſt adviſe's him to
ſerve himſelfe of the aſſiſtance of
the <hi>Cardinall,</hi> to avoid diſguſting
of the <hi>King</hi> any further. De <hi>Noyers</hi>
meets the <hi>Cardinall</hi> in the <hi>Louvre,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand's
this grace of him publique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and with a kind of Pompe, that
the world might take notice of it,
as a generous, free action of his own,
and accordingly the <hi>Cardinall</hi> does
the office, after ſome excuſes, with
more ſhew then reality; at his return
bringing him that diſmiſſion which
he deſired, and received with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations
of the cordialleſt ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity.
This fall of <hi>Noyers</hi> was
onely grievous to the <hi>Mareſchal</hi>
de <hi>Meſteraye,</hi> who being much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed
in his preſervation, addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
himſelfe a new to the <hi>Cardinall</hi>

that he reſented this act of

any other, and had omitted no

               <p>The <hi>Mareſchal</hi> ſuffered himſelfe
to be ſo farre tranſported with

the <hi>Mareſchall</hi> to let his Majeſtie

future. That the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had
not refuſed a ſuſpenſion of arms,
before ſo earneſtly deſired by
them, on any other ground, then a
certain miſpriſion which they had
conceived of the troubles of <hi>France</hi>
likely to enſue on the failing of
his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> and therefore that the
true way to undeceive them was to
make it evident, that whatſoever
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:115788:57"/>
event ſhould happen his <hi>Majeſtie's</hi>
will ſhould ſtand for a ſure and
inviolable Law for the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
of his <hi>Kingdome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>King</hi> accepted not onely of
their diſcourſe, but affectionately
thanked them, and then deſired to
hear the <hi>Prince's</hi> judgement about
the diſpoſall of the <hi>Government.</hi>
Who thereupon took occaſion to
extoll highly the wiſdome and
goodneſſe of the <hi>Queene,</hi> and after
ſet himſelfe to excuſe the <hi>Duke</hi> of
<hi>Orleans,</hi> aſcribing his eſcapes to the
over-rigid treatments of the late
<hi>Cardinall,</hi> ſhewing that theſe two
perſons as the chiefe of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
ought by conſequence to
have the principall part in ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
an adminiſtration.</p>
               <p>The <hi>King</hi> having well learned
by his own experience how ſubject
<hi>France</hi> is to alterations in the times
of <hi>Minority,</hi> was the more deſirous
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:115788:58"/>
to leave a ſtate well ſetled, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
neither the <hi>Queen</hi> nor the <hi>Duke</hi>
of <hi>Orleans</hi> (whom he did not eye
ſo well) ſhould invelope the whole
authority in their own perſons,
which he deviſed to diſtribute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
ſeverall <hi>Councellours,</hi> and
to give them the <hi>Cardinall Maz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarini</hi>
for their <hi>Principall,</hi> much
after the manner of the <hi>Government</hi>
of <hi>Sweden,</hi> with the <hi>ſuperintenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>
of the <hi>grand Chancellour Oxen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern:</hi>
which thoughts when he
had diſcovered to the <hi>Cardinall,</hi> he
found not ſuch approbation as he
deſired, but rather met with ſtrong
arguments, perſwading him to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the ancient uſances of the
<hi>Crown.</hi> But after all deliberations
the <hi>King</hi> at laſt reſolved to forme
a <hi>Councell,</hi> according to the tenor
of a declaration which he ſent
forthwith to the <hi>Queen,</hi> by the
hand of <hi>Monſieur dè Chauvigny<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:115788:58"/>
the prime ſecretary of State, that
ſhee might ſee it, and ſignifie her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
about any change in it for her
better ſatisfaction, that ſo being
afterward approved by the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
it might be to paſſe as a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi>
Law among the people; which
laſt words touched to the quick,
though at that time the <hi>Queen</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
them with diſcretion, and
preſently paſſed to the <hi>King</hi>'s
chamber to render thanks, and to
condole with him, till both melted
into tears with expreſſions of love
and tenderneſs. Next morning the
<hi>Cardinall Mazzarini</hi> comes to
<hi>Paris</hi> to give account of the <hi>King's</hi>
reſolutions to the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Orleans,</hi>
with intimation to the <hi>Parliament,
Princes, Dukes, Peeres,</hi> and <hi>officers</hi>
of the <hi>Crown,</hi> to preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to his <hi>Majeſtie</hi> at S. <hi>Germans,</hi>
where a fit time being waited,
till the <hi>Kings</hi> maladie was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:115788:59"/>
alleviated, they were all
called into his Chamber, where
the <hi>Queen</hi> and her two Sons ſtayed
for them; and then his <hi>Majeſty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
ſpeaking all the while uncovered,
made a paſſionate ſpeech unto
them, accompanied with ſuch car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
as preſſed tears from the
by-ſtanders. After which the
<hi>Secretarie</hi> de la <hi>Urilliere</hi> read the
declaration of his <hi>Majeſtie</hi>'s laſt
will, which was to this effect:</p>
               <p>That although it had pleaſed <hi>God</hi>
to beſtow admirable ſucceſſes on him
through the whole courſe of his raign;
yet now in the middle of his proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,
he had alſo put him in mind of
his frailty by a languiſhing diſeaſe,
whereof howſoever there were good
hope of his recovering, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
becauſe the judgments of men
moſt experienced are fallible in theſe
caſes, he thought himſelfe oblieged to
provide for the peace of his <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:115788:59"/>
when he was gone. That he
judged the beſt way to obtain this
end, and to diſappoint the projects
of the enemies of <hi>France,</hi> to be the
uniting of all the <hi>royall</hi> family with
one Spirit to maintain the preſent
ſtate of his <hi>Crown;</hi> which would be
alſo a great tie to his <hi>confederates</hi>
to adhere to the intereſſes of <hi>France,</hi>
when they ſhall find it governed by
the ſame maximes that had hitherto
upheld its grandeur. To execute
which deſignes he thought no courſe
more expedient, then that which the
<hi>King</hi>'s his predeceſſors had taken on
the like occaſions, who judged that
the <hi>regency</hi> of the <hi>Kingdome,</hi> and
education of the <hi>minor Kings</hi> could
not be better placed, then on the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of their <hi>Queen Mothers;</hi> and
therfore that he did ordain, that in
caſe his death ſhould enſue before the
<hi>Dauphin</hi> ſhould enter on the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
year of his age, or in caſe that
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:115788:60"/>
the <hi>Dauphin</hi> ſhould die before the
<hi>Majority</hi> of his ſecond Sonne the
<hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Anjou,</hi> his deareſt ſpouſe
and conſort the <hi>Queen Mother</hi> of
his foreſaid children ſhould be <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
of</hi> France, <hi>and have the</hi> educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them during their <hi>minority,</hi>
together with the adminiſtration
of the government of the <hi>Kingdome,</hi>
during his <hi>nonage</hi> that ſhould be
<hi>King,</hi> with the adviſe of her <hi>coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell</hi>
in manner hereafter following.
And in caſe the ſaid <hi>Queen</hi> after
his death, and during her <hi>Regency</hi>
ſhould be in danger of finiſhing her
daies, he ordained that ſhe ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
with the adviſe of her Councell
herein ſpecified, for the <hi>Regency</hi> and
government for the time. And to
teſtifie to his dear and beloved Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Orleans,</hi> that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
hath been able to diminiſh the
Love that he hath ever borne him,
he ordained him <hi>Lieutenant Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall</hi>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:115788:60"/>
of the non-aged King, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
the ſaid charge in all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
in the <hi>Kingdome</hi> under the
authority of the <hi>Queen Regent</hi> and
of the Councell; and this notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the declaration regiſtred againſt
him in the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Parliament:</hi>
onely declaring that if he in any wiſe
ſhall contravene this eſtabliſhment,
he remain <hi>ipſo facto</hi> deprived of this
charge. That although from the
wiſdome, piety and vertue of the
<hi>Queen</hi> he might well promiſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
a happy government of his <hi>ſtate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
yet conſidering the weight of ſuch a
charge, and the impoſsibility of her
taking cogniſance of all affairs neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that he thought fit to eſtabliſh a
<hi>councell of the Regency</hi> to aſsiſt
her, by whoſe judgments and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
the great and weighty affairs of
<hi>State</hi> ſhould be examined and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by <hi>plurality of Voices:</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
which <hi>Councell,</hi> he thought he
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:115788:61"/>
could not make better election for
<hi>Miniſters</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> then of his dear
and beloved Coſins, the <hi>Prince</hi> of
<hi>Condè,</hi> and the <hi>Cardinall Mazza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini,</hi>
of his truſtie and well beloved
the <hi>Lord</hi> de <hi>Seguier Chancellour</hi> of
<hi>France,</hi> and keeper of the ſeals, the
<hi>Lord</hi> de <hi>Bouttiglier</hi> Surintendant
of his finances, and the <hi>Lord</hi> de
<hi>Chauvigni</hi> Secretarie of State, and
of his Commandments.</p>
               <p>He ordained alſo that the <hi>Duke</hi> of
<hi>Orleans,</hi> and in his abſence the <hi>Prince</hi>
of <hi>Condè,</hi> or <hi>Cardinall Mazzarini</hi>
ſhould be chiefe of the <hi>Councill,</hi> and
if any place ſhould become void,
that the <hi>Queen</hi> ſhould ſupply it by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe
of the <hi>Councell</hi> and all other
important charges of the <hi>Kingdome</hi>
to be ſo diſpoſed by <hi>plurality</hi> of <hi>votes.</hi>
Only for all <hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which belonged to his nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
he left the providing for their
ſupply to the <hi>Queen</hi> and the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:115788:61"/>
Mazzarini,</hi> of whoſe worthy
diſcharging this truſt he had good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to reſt moſt aſſured by the eminent
proofs which he had had of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
and great ſufficiency of the
perſon. In fine: he ordained that
the <hi>Queen</hi> and the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Orleans</hi>
ſhould ſwear in the preſence of him,
and of the <hi>Princes</hi> of the <hi>Blood,</hi>
with the other <hi>Princes,</hi> Dukes, Peers,
Mareſchals of France, and Officers
of the Crowne to keep and obſerve
the Contents of the preſent declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
without any manner of Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention.
Which was accordingly
ſubſcribed and ſworne at the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
by the <hi>Queen,</hi> and <hi>Duke</hi> of
<hi>Orleans, and ſealed before the reſt,
and accordingly next day ratified in
the</hi> Parliament <hi>in preſence of the</hi>
Duke <hi>of</hi> Orleans, the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Condè</hi>
and the other Princes and Officers.
Given at <hi>S. Germans</hi> in the month
of April. 1643. and of his raign
the 33.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:115788:62"/>
Which declaration being read,
the <hi>King</hi> gave free liberty to all
the exiles of the <hi>Court</hi> or <hi>State,</hi>
againſt whom no Sentence had
been given, to make their return,
and commanded corriers to be ſent
to ſome more remote, that they
might have timely notice, and his
<hi>Majeſty</hi> had content before his
death to receive the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſma,</hi>
the <hi>Mareſchaux</hi> de <hi>Baſſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pierre</hi>
and d' <hi>Eſtree,</hi> and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
into his grace. If a man
might be politique before the
proofe of events, this act of State
might be a ſubject of ſtrange deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantings:
but if we can content
our ſelves with ſuch conjectures as
beſt pleaſe us, till the <hi>Regency</hi>
begin to take place, we may better
gueſſe at the true intereſts of the
parties concerned by this deed, &amp; of
the true intereſt of the <hi>Crown.</hi> His
