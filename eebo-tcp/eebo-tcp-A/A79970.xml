            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I was ſcarce enter'd the Limits of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> when I was by a young Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man entertained with the Relation of a Printed Controverſy about <hi>Vomiting</hi> in <hi>Fevers,</hi> betwixt two Phyſitians of <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> (which being a Practice I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways approved, as having been tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to me, both by the Inſtructions and conſtant Example of my Father and Grand-Father, who were Men deſervedly Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in their Profeſſion, and could have no deſign to deceive me; and ſince confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by my own Experience in near 50 Years plentiful Employment) I was not a little Curious to peruſe; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly I no ſooner arrived there, than I procured their Papers. I Confeſs, I have not the good Fortune to be known to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Gentlemen, as I remember: But that did not Diſcourage me from put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Pen to Paper, ſince my Opinion may therefore paſs for the more Impartial, at leaſt with reſpect to their Perſons; and ſince I am not accuſtomed to conſider ſo much, who Writes, as what is Written; For <hi>Amicus Hippocrates, Amicus Galenus, ſed magis Amica Veritas</hi>: And this being a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:153843:4"/>
of no ſmall Moment to Men's Lives and Healths, the beſt of Wordly Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: I conceive my ſelf Obliged not to paſs it over in Silence, but to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municat my Thoughts, with Submiſſion to better Judgements.</p>
            <p>The occaſion of this Paper Warr, ſeems to be a Scandalous Report, ſuppoſed at leaſt to be induſtriouſly ſpread thro' Town and Countrey by the Ordinary or his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betters, That Dr. <hi>Oliphant</hi> had Killed a Patient with a Vomit; And that giving Vomits in Fevers was an Innovation in Medecin never heard of before. Now, leaſt this ſhould affect the Drs. Reputation, he thought it neceſſary to Vindicat the Truth and Himſelf, and to mantain his ſaid Practice by Reaſon and Authoritys, as well as by a Faithful Relation of the Fact: And in order thereto he Prints a ſhort Diſcourſe to prove the Uſefulneſs of Vomiting in Fevers <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary endeavours to Refute with his <hi>Melius Inquirendum,</hi> or an Anſwer to Dr. <hi>Oliphant</hi>'s Diſcourſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in which it does not plainly appear, that he denys the greateſt part of the Relation, but only quarrels at ſome Trifling Omiſſions, which he therefore ſupplys in his <hi>Melius Inquirendum, (viz.</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:153843:4"/>
the frightfull conſequences of the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Vomit, with the number of his Vomits of Luke-warm Water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and of his Bleeding, Purging, and Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtering the Seven days before: And then proceeds to refute the Dr's. Reaſons, and to ſhew his miſtakeing, miſunderſtanding and miſapplying the ſeveral Authoritys, he quotes, all which is loaded with a few Quibles and Reflections; and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes.</p>
            <p>Now with the Ordinary's leave, I'le begin with the conſideration of the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, on which he ſeems to lay the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Streſs. Which is this,</p>
            <p>Whether the giving an Ounce of <hi>Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Wine,</hi> mixed with Three Drams of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup of <hi>Buckthorn,</hi> on the the 9<hi>th.</hi> day of a Fever, to one who had been Blooded twice Vomited thrice, Clyſtered ſeveral times, all in Seven Days time, which Vomit wrought ſo violently 8 or 10 Hours together, that the Patient was reduced to the laſt Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, his Hands and Feet cold, his pulſe quite gone, <hi>Spaſmodick</hi> contractions through the Body, be a Practice agreeable to right reaſon, the rules of Art, and the Practiſe of the beſt Phyſicians both Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and Modern.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:153843:5"/>The firſt thing herein, which offers it ſelf, is the Doſe of the Emetick Wine, which cannot well be adjudged, unleſs the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration or <hi>Pharmacopaeia,</hi> by which it was diſpenſed, were known: For I remember, there were two Eminent Apothecaries Shops in <hi>London,</hi> of which both the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are ſince Graduated Doctors, and of no ſmall Eſteem, and in the one of them half an Ounce was a large Doſe, and in the other two Ounces was but a moderat one, tho generally, according to the common Preparation of the Infuſion of <hi>Crocus Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallorum</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> an Ounce and half or two Ounces, is a fit Vomit for a Man, to be by a fourth or fifth part increas'd or leſſened, according to the Strength or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Circumſtances of the Patient,</p>
            <p>The next Remark is, Whether it was proper on the 9th. day of a Fever? I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, times in Fevers, before they were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter underſtood, uſed to be Religiouſly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved: But of late the proper Seaſon to give Vomits is, whenever there is an Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation for them, whether the Firſt, Ninth, or Fifteenth Day, ſooner or later, provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there is no material Contra-indication. Of this I had a late inſtance in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try upon my Lord <hi>Tullibardine</hi>'s Page, who
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:153843:5"/>
had languiſhed with a Fever about 40 days, moſt of which time he had faint Sweats, with burning Heats, little Sleep, great Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings: The Nerves of his Tongue and of many parts of the Body frequently affected, in ſo much that he often loſt his Speech, and had no uſe of his Limbs, for Weakneſs and Trembling, beſides other Symptoms, as Coughs, &amp;c. He was reduced to a Ske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leton. This Gentleman in this deplorable ſtate, took about 10 or 12 Drams of Infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>Crocus Mettallorum,</hi> which wrought very kindly, and from that Minute reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered plainly to all mens ſenſe, and in leſs than 24 hours all the Symptoms vaniſhed: Afterwards he took 3 or 4 times the <hi>Decoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum amarum cum ſenna,</hi> and in a Weeks time he was able to walk abroad, and in few days enjoyed his perfect Health.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Patients having been twice Blooded, Purged, and thrice Vomited with Whey or warm Water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was not a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Argument againſt giving of Emetick Wine, if there yet remained a proper In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication for a Vomit; becauſe if the firſt, 2<hi>d.</hi> &amp; 3d. Exhibition were reaſonable, becauſe there was an Indication for Vomiting, I am humbly of opinion, that as long as the ſame continued, the ſame meaſures ought
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:153843:6"/>
to be purſued, and perhaps with more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor than before.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Tho all this was done in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven days, yet, if the Nature of an acute Diſeaſe require it, not only Evacuation ought to be repeted the eight Day; but probably it was a great Omiſſion, that more had not been done in Number, Power, or both, within the firſt ſeven Days.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The Operation as related de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves a place here alſo, being a Material part of the Queſtion, which ſays, that the Patient was reduced to the laſt extremity (tho by the ſequel it did but ſeem to be ſo, for the Patient is very well) that the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine wrought by Stool 8 or 10 Hours to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, which appears to be no more than neceſſary, to expel ſuch a quantity of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Humours, and to ſave his Life: But how are we certain it was the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, and not a concurrent Criſis, made ſo large an Evacuation? For I have known, that a Medecin has been blamed for the like, when it would naturally have rather hindered, then provoked it. Next the Patients Hands and Feet were Cold, his Pulſe quite gone, and Spaſmadick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions affected his whole Body: Theſe truly ſeem Frightful, but yet are never
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:153843:6"/>
Dangerous in the Operation of a Vomit: And beſide, the Dr, in <hi>p.</hi> 5. or his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, denies, they followed the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Vomit; but, in caſe they had, it muſt have been very difficult to diſtinguiſh, whether they were the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the Vomit, or of the Diſtemper; they frequently attending Diſtempers, and but rarely Vomits: And I pray how can it be known, whether theſe Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms might not have been much worſe, if no Vomit had been taken, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Patient might not then have dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in earneſt, who now only to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſeem'd to be a dying? And here the Queſtion comes to be ſum'd up: Whether this be a Practice agreable to right Reaſon, the Rules of Art, and the Practice of the beſt Phyſicians both An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and Modern?</p>
            <p>This indeed deſerves a ſerious Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, tho, if it ſhould but agree with right Reaſon and the Rules of true Art, it is no great Matter, whether it has the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of the beſt Ancient and Modern
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:153843:7"/>
Phyſicians; Reaſon and Art being very ſufficient, tho' Authorities were wanting.</p>
            <p>A few Reaſons may therefore be here added to the Conſideration of the Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, as</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> May we not reaſonably believe, that neither the Doſe, nor time it was adminiſtred, did any ways prejudice the Patient, ſince not only he recovered af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but thouſands have taken larger Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes at that, and all other times of a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, both without Injury and with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Advantage; and poſſibly it will be no eaſy Task for the Ordinary, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an Inſtance of any Patient, that certainly ſuffered only by the like Doſe or time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> May we not rationally ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that, if the previous Evacuations, being proper, had not effected the Cure, they ought to be rejected: Or that, if improper and too weak, more proper and powerful ſhould be applied, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, till the Indication ceas'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> May we not fairly preſume,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:153843:7"/>
that the Continuance of the Operation 8 or 10 Hours, and the terrible Symptoms mentioned, if there were any ſuch, were rather cauſed by the Violence of the Sickneſs, then by the Vomit, becauſe ſo ſmall a Doſe rarely, if ever, works above 4 Hours, and becauſe ſuch like Symptoms frequently occur, where no Vomit has been given: And becauſe 'tis probable nothing, but the remaining Vitious Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, put in Agitation, could produce ſuch new Symptoms, and keep the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient ill ſo many days after; <hi>Non Cauſa pro Cauſa</hi> makes moſt Miſtakes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> May it ſeem unreaſonable to conclude, that ill Humors are the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Cauſe of all Fevers, as well as they are of other Diſtempers: And that, ſo long as they continue moving in any Quantity, ſo long the Patient muſt be diſordered, if not in Danger: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that they ought, by all proper and ſpeedy Methods to be expelled, till when there can be but ſmall Hopes the Fever ſhould be extinguiſhed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:153843:8"/>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> May it not be conſonant to right Reaſon to think, that, if Vomits and other Evacuations are given to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the offending Humor, being the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true end of all Medicaments, they could neither prejudice nor weaken the Patient near ſo much, as the Diſeaſe, either let alone, or trifled with.</p>
            <p>Theſe Particulars, 'tis hoped, may ſerve to ſhew, Reaſon is not ſo much a Stranger to this Sort of Practice: Let it now appear, how much ſome Rules of Art may ſupport the ſame, by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing approved Maxims. As</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ablata cauſa tollitur affectus. Ubi ad animi defectionem educere expedit, facien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum id quoque, ſi aeger par eſſe poſſit. Obſta principiis, ſero medicina paratur. Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis morbis extrema remedia conveniunt. Purgandum in valde acutis, ſi turgeat ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria, eodem ipſo die, differre enim in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libus malum. Praeſtat anceps remedium quam nullum dum natura movet, move; quo natura tendit, tende, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I muſt now go to the next Paragraph,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:153843:8"/>
where the ordinary Cenſures the Dr. for Labouring in Vain, ſince it was never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, that Vomits in Fevers is no No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty: but then its ſtrange, he had not ſooner ordered one more effectual, than Whey and Luke-warm Water, which ſcarce deſerves the Name of Vomits, bringing ſeldom much more off the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach than themſelves, and rarely if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the peccant Matter. Then he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plys, that Antimonial Vomits murder Men, Women and Children, and that the Practitioner deſerves to be accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly puniſhed. Truely unleſs the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary hath murdered any with ſuch Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, I muſt be ſo uncivil, as to disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve his Suggeſtion; for I have given, and known given ſome Hundred Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, and do not remember, that ever one of them could be juſtly taxed for having in the leaſt cauſed, or haſtned the Death of one Pateint, that muſt not certainly have died without. But this is the Misfortune, that when a Patient dies under the Cure, tho by the Ignorance
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:153843:9"/>
or Neglect of a pretended cautious Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, who preſcribes plentifully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Cordials, he ſhall ſeldom, if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, be blamed, but extolled for a ſafe tender Hearted Doctor, <hi>cujus contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi>; &amp;c. But on the other ſide, if it happens, that a Patient die in the hands of an honeſt Skilful Phyſician, who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows effectual Remedies, tho plainly off the Diſtemper, or for his being called too late, 'tis Odds, but the Wiſe and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling Goſſips damns him for a raſh and dangerous Phyſician, becauſe he dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted few or no Cordials, but only Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Medicines, fit to combat and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the Diſeaſe, which indeed are more uneaſie to the Patient, and frightful to the Ignorant byſtanders in their Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and leſs grateful to the Pallat, tho much more ſafe and effectual than the pleaſant comfortable Cordials, ſo much applauded by perſons of ſlender Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in ſuch Matters.</p>
            <p>In the 6 and 7 Pages, the Ordinary ſays, the Patient had been purged more,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:153843:9"/>
had not the Dr. by his Raſhneſs preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, and brought the Patient to ſo low a Paſs, that no Place was left for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, but Cordials and gentle Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ats. I am glad to find here, he could have continued Evacuations longer, and hope, for the future he'll proportion them in Number, Quantity and Power to the Diſcaſe, or elſe, tho never ſo proper, he'll certainly faill of Succeſs, as the Sequel proved, his Vomits of Whey did. But further, if the Diſeaſe be ſtill rampant, tho the Patient was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry low, yet was there more room for Evacuation, than Opiats and Cordials, to expel the Cauſe of the Diſeaſe, and whenever that ſhall be removed, a little Milk Pottage or Gruel would have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured reſt and Strength ſooner, than ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Opiats or Cordials: For that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken away, which obſtructed Sleep and Strength, Nature without other help, will very well perform her own Duty.</p>
            <p>Reaſons are not wanting to prove e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:153843:10"/>
Aſſertion, but that it would ſwel this Letter beyond the due Limits, and it's hoped, that what is not proved, is ſo ſelf evident, that 'twould be ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to add any further.</p>
            <p>In the ſame 7<hi>th</hi> Page, after an Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at a triple Doſe in ſtead of a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>druple, he affirms that every Phyſician, acquainted with <hi>Emeticks,</hi> knows, that two Drams with a little <hi>Oxymell</hi> will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuat conſiderably: If he means five or ſix Ounces of <hi>Oxymel</hi> by that little, I believe it may, but otherways I never heard of leſs than an Ounce of the ſaid Wine, was ever given to a grown Man, and ſeldom ſo little, except in the Shop abovementioned.</p>
            <p>It is a probability next a Proof, that, if ſo much of the peccant Matter had not been carried off with the Dr's <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Vomit,</hi> the Patient, who was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo bad with the Remainder of the Diſeaſe, could never have ſubſiſted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Burthen of the whole, therefore the Dr's Conjecture does not ſeem to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:153843:10"/>
be ſo Groundleſs: The Reaſon offered by the Ordinary, can never ſupport his Aſſertion: For, where Nature proves too strong for the Fever, and throws all the vitious Humours out by Vomit, Sweat, or otherways: The Patient certainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers, not only without Vomits but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Phyſitian, or Medicines; And of this there are Multitudes of Inſtances in all Ages: But yet, even in theſe caſes where Nature is thus Victorious; The Skilful Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, according to Natures indication of an Honeſt Phyſitian may be very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to render the Cure more certain and ſpeedy, tho his principal Duty be to reſcue thoſe out of the Jaws of Death, for whoſe Nature, the Diſeaſe would elſe have been too powerful.</p>
            <p>In Page 8, he allows Vomits in Fevers, if adminiſtred by wary and skilful Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, to which I readily conſent, for no other ought to be admitted to Practiſe, and in ſuch hands edge Tools are better then blunt ones; Fooles and Knaves ought not to prophane ſo ſacred a profeſſion. But what proviſion is made for a fair Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of Phyſicians abilities: The Univerſity ſeems not the moſt fit; for they rather pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them to be made, than make them Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians. Phyſicians Colledges wherever they be conſtituted, are Partys; and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecarys are too much byaſſed by their
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:153843:11"/>

            <p>In the ſame Paragraph the Ordinary promiſes, what I do not find he hath yet performed, and what I would gladly ſee, <hi>viz.</hi> that the taking the Vomit had almoſt killed the Patient, when it ſeems rather to have been the Diſeaſe, that had almoſt killed him, and in all probability certainly would have done it, had he not taken the Vomit, <hi>But non cauſa pro cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa makes all or most mistakes in the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the laſt Paragraph of the ſame Page, the Ordinary gives an account, that at firſt the Vomit wrought pretty well both Upwards and Downwards, and then the Dr. goes off, but a little after the Patient began to purge ſo violently. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now a good Homward perſon might have thence concluded, and it may be more truly that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Operation of the Vomit was quite finiſhed, Nature, being in part thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, rallyed her ſcattered Spirits to make a Critical Evacuation of the remainder; for, he ſays, the Patient began again to purge: And that all the Symptomes then
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:153843:11"/>
appearing were no other, but what every experienced Phyſician knows to be very uſual in ſuch Evacuations of like Matter, where only the Criſis, without any Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine whatſoever, proves <hi>Naturam Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ricem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What the Doctor preſcribed, in concert with an other Phyſician, to help to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and to Suppreſs Vapours, was not amiſs; ſince Nature, without ſome Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals of Reſt, is unable to bear the Fatigue of diſcharging all the preternatural Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors at once.</p>
            <p>Page 9th. It is a little wonderful, the Ordinary at his Return ſhould be ſurprized at ſo great a Change in 48 Hours, when in acute Diſtempers all Practitioners, how mean ſoever, cannot but know, there may be much greater in 12 Hours time: And the Abatement of the Fever, till all the Morbifick Matter was ſpent, he ought not to have expected; for oftimes the laſt Fit of an Intermitting Fever, when moſt of the <hi>Saburra</hi> is expell'd, ſeems to be the moſt violent: Therefore there was more reaſon for him to be pleaſed, that it continued in order to expel by the Pores, what ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, which ſeemed to be their joint O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion: For, if they had not thought, there had ſtill remained ſome ill Humors, it had been a great cruelty to have torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a weak Patient with bliſtering Plaſters, in order to draw them out.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:153843:12"/>In Page 10<hi>th,</hi> The Ordinary takes notice, That on Saturday, being the 6<hi>th</hi> day after he had taken the Vomit, the Symptoms began gradually to decline, which was reaſonable to be expected, Nature having then finiſhed the Expulſion of ſuch peccant Matter, as ſtill remained after the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Vomit.</p>
            <p>In Page 11<hi>th.</hi> there is this Paſſage: Whoſe Temper and Conſtitution he was not in the leaſt acquainted with, and who had undergone ſo many Evacuations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſince there could be no hazard of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a leſs Doſe: As if forſooth, in an acute Diſeaſe, which requires the ſpeedy Aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Phyſician, nothing ſhould be done by him, under Pretence of not being acquainted with the Conſtitution of the Patient, and ſo let ſlip the Opportunity of ſaving his Life: Neither do I agree to his Opinion, that there is no hazard in giving a leſs Doſe, for every Cure, which comes ſhort of the Diſeaſe muſt be very hazardous, by ſubjecting the Patient to its Power with ſuch ſmall Aſſiſtance; Diſeaſes being ever dangerous, when Remedies are rarely ſo, unleſs very unskilfully adminiſtred.</p>
            <p>Page 12<hi>th.</hi> he is pleaſed to call Weakneſs a Contra-Indication to Evacuation, which is certainly true, where there is no Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Matter to be Evacuated: But, where
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:153843:12"/>
there is, nothing can ſtrengthen ſuch weak Patients ſo much, as the removing that Matter, which at firſt cauſed it, and, if continued, will certainly increaſe it.</p>
            <p>I can as little approve his Commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſuch a wary Phyſician, who is back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to preſcribe ſtrong Evacuations, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by Vomit; for, when ſtrong Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines are neceſſary, it is as great a Fault to omit them, as to give them, where they are certainly not wanted: But, if he means ſuch ſtrong Medicines, or large Doſes, as no Man of Senſe ever gave, I muſt agree with him, that its a dangerous Practice to blow up a Houſe to diſlodge an Enemy, which, tho it be a frequent Military Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, ſeems here but an improper Simile. To proportion juſtly the Strength and Doſe of a Medicine to the Power of a Diſeaſe, and to triffle away no time with too gentle Methods, is not only the Duty of a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, but an evident Demonſtration of his great Skill and Judgment; as the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry would be of his Weakneſs.</p>
            <p>The difficult Problem left undetermined in the 13<hi>th.</hi> Page, whether theſe Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhould precede or follow Blooding, I think may be ſolved by common Senſe and frequent Practice, without the help of <hi>Euclid</hi>'s Elements; for every Houſe-Wife can tell, that, when an inner and outer
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:153843:13"/>
Room are to be made clean, it's beſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning with the inner; for, if you ſhould firſt clean the outer Room, you cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void fouling it again, when you go about cleaning the inner.</p>
            <p>Now, If Vomits and Purges cleanſe the <hi>Primae viae,</hi> whence the Blood is ſupplyed, as none denys, its fitter to begin there, leſt, after the Blood is leſſened in quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it ſhould be again defiled by the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies it muſt receive from the <hi>Primae viae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Page 14, The Ordinary affirms, that the Dr: would not have failed to have killed outright, if either the Doſe had been a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſtronger, or the Patient a little weaker, which was to ſail too near the Wind. Such<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Suppoſals may be made in all Caſes, where Malice or Friendſhip is concerned, which may be as eaſily anſwered, that the Dr. judging exactly his Patients Strength, ſo proportioned the Doſe of the Emetick as to be neither too ſtrong for his Patient, nor too weak for his Fever: And thus by ſailing ſo near the Wind, a Prize may be taken, which might elſe eſcape.</p>
            <p>Tho I had reſolved not to meddle with the Authorities, yet I could not let them ſlip without this remark, that, if theſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors had never ſeen, or had like Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to make ſuch Reflections, as our modern Practitioners may have had, Poſterity
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:153843:13"/>
muſt be condemned never to grow Wiſer: Whatever was well ſaid or obſerved by theſe Authors, was only ſo far ſo, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted with right Reaſon and Experience: And, if both the ſame be the Guides of this preſent Age, I know not, why a wiſe and true Saying or Obſervation of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Generation, may not be as authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick as of any of the former.</p>
            <p>Page 17 and 18, The ordinary drawing towards a Concluſion affirms, that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Phyſicians, but all Men in their right Wits, muſt condemn a Practice, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth Men to the laſt Extremity, and brings them to the brink of the Grave, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially when there is no neceſſity: This ſurely may be granted by all Men, but hath little regard to the Caſe in hand: Where its manifeſt, it was not the Dr's Practice, but the Diſeaſe reduced the Patient to this Extremity, and it was ſo far from being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary, that without it, in all Probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the <hi>Patient</hi> muſt moſt certainly have died; <hi>but there is the Miſchief of</hi> non Cauſa pro Cauſa.</p>
            <p>In Page 19, The Ordinary ſeems to grant all that is deſired, (<hi>viz.</hi>) That Fevers both with and without Vomits and other Evacuations may be cured, reſtraining Antimonial Vomits only to greater circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection, and this he ſupports with <hi>Rive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:153843:14"/>
his Opinion; but, if none but skilful and circumſpect Perſons were permitted to practice, as no other ought, then ſharp Knives and Swords ought not to be negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, Skilful Perſons knowing ful well how to uſe them to the beſt purpoſe.</p>
            <p>This in brief is faithfully my Opinion, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
