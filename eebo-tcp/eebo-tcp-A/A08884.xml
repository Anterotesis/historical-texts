            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>Aliart</hi> hauing about him all neceſſaries, that are required in ſuch an vrgent néede, went to <hi>Argentaos</hi> ſhip, wherein béeing entred, he found <hi>Dramuſiande, Almaroll, Francian</hi> prince of <hi>

Wherefore cauſing the ſhypps thus to enter the Iſle in this cloude, he commaunded that <hi>Dramu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiande,</hi> with the Princes <hi>Francian</hi> and <hi>Dragonalte,</hi> ſhould be brought into the ſhippe, where <hi>Primaleon</hi> and the reſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue were: but ſeperated them from the other, becauſe as yet no expreſſe ſigne appeared in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whether they ſhould eſcape the danger or no: and the rather, that the extreame affliction of the one, might raiſe no diſcomfort in the other. Afterward he appointed, that the ſhippe which brought the dead, ſhould enter the néereſt Bay to the Fountaine where the beaſts of mettall were, like them which <hi>Palmerin</hi> ſlew when he conquered that Iſle: and thence they were caried into a faire Pallace, where they remained til he could giue them ſufficient buriall. All which he did, to the end, the Ladies (whoſe huſbands were dead) ſhould not offend the
<pb facs="tcp:14347:7"/>
liuing with theyr dolorous complaints: intending by little and little to make them forget theyr loſſes, and with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to beare their ouer-hard fortune.</p>
               <p>The ſhyppe béeing thus come into the Bay, immediatly the newes of theyr arriuall was knowne to the Ladies, where-upon, accompanied with the men of the Iſle, they came in great fury running thetherward, each of them thinking to finde her huſband aliue, not déeming how ſoone they ſhould rue theyr miſhaps. When they were come to the ſhippe, <hi>Aliart,</hi> who beſt knew the eſtate of the wounded Princes: with chéerefull countenaunce met them, and bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing round enuironed with them, taking <hi>Gridonia</hi> and <hi>Fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rida</hi> each by the hand, ſaid: Ladies, I am glad of a deceite happening to me in mine owne arte, which vntruly tolde me, that all the defenders of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Empire, ſhould perriſh, and the Cittie of <hi>Constantinople</hi> be in the enemies poſſeſſion: but (prayſed be the diuine bounty) the Pagans are diſcomfited, &amp; all your Lords in good hope of life. But thus I would aduiſe, that without any noyſe, or your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance, they might be brought foorth of the Shippe, and each one quietly carried to his Ladies lodging: For thys I muſt tell yée, there is another Shyppe at hand, wherein commeth <hi>Argentao</hi> with many other, among whom are they that died before you were conueyed to this Iſland.</p>
               <p>All the Ladies, betwéene hope &amp; dread, departed thence, each to her Cabinet, becauſe they would not contrary what <hi>Aliart</hi> had appointed. Then cauſed he to be caried <hi>Primale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> to <hi>Gridonia, Florendos</hi> to <hi>Miragarda, Platir</hi> to <hi>Sidelia, Don Edward</hi> to <hi>Flerida, Palmerin</hi> to <hi>Polinarda, Florian</hi> to <hi>Leonarda, Berolde, Gracian,</hi> and <hi>Dragonalte,</hi> ſeuerallie to their wiues: <hi>Floraman</hi> to a Pallace hard by, and <hi>Blandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> to his mother.</p>
               <p>And one thing moſt notable happened, when <hi>Palmerin</hi> was brought to his Lady, the loue which betwéene them had euer beene equall, wrought now a contrary effect. For <hi>Polinarda,</hi> ſeeing her huſband not able to ſtand on his féete, in great amazement was depriued of her ſpeech: And hée
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:14347:7"/>
that had not the power to ſpeake a worde while hee was in the Shyp, when hée beheld his loue thus ouer-gone with gréefe, ſuddainly ſaid: Feare not ſwéete Lady, for I ſhall ſoone be well.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aliart</hi> gaue order to the Princeſſes, how they ſhould dreſſe and regard their wounded huſbands: then taking with him <hi>Cardigea, Bernarda,</hi> and <hi>Arlencea,</hi> hee conducted them to the Shyp, where they might looke to their Lords, becauſe as yet they were not in caſe to be brought out of the Shippe. Ioy intermedled with feare, made theſe La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies diligent &amp; carefull each of her charge: but they whoſe huſbands were not there preſent, neither dead nor aliue, were wondrouſly afflicted with gréefe, and had not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place béene ſo enchaunted, that thence they could not depart, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them would haue aduentured by land and ſea to haue found them.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Aliart</hi> by faire promiſes ſtill gaue them hope, that ſhortlie they would be there, all which auailed not: For when they ſawe ſo many Princes, which were the verie flower of all the Chriſtian Knights, ſo dangerouſly woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, &amp; in ſuch perill, they had little hope of their huſbands liues. And this was partlie occaſioned, by one of the prince <hi>Beroldes</hi> ſeruants, who comming in the Shippe with <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentao,</hi> where the dead were, happened to ſteppe in at the ſame inſtant, when <hi>Aliart</hi> laboured to continue the hope of the widdowed Ladies, &amp; ſaid, that <hi>Argentao</hi> had brought back the Knights dead.</p>
               <p>Theſe wordes did ſo dampe and vtterly diſmay theyr mindes, that beeing nowe more then certaine of theyr ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall loſſe, in rage they would preſentlie haue runne to ſéeke their dead bodies: But <hi>Aliart,</hi> who by the ſkilfulnes of his Arte ſought to quallifie their diſcontentment, cauſed certaine ſpirits ſpéedily to appeare before them, reſembling in ſhape and proportion the knowne ſeruants to theyr Huſbands, and they to each Lady deliuered ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Liart</hi> being gone from <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> toward the <hi>Perillous Ile,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing by his ſkill, that there would happen a miſchaunce, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to diſturbe the Princes quiet: made his arriuall there the ſooner, finding all things wel as yet, that the Knights had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently recouered their great loſſe of blood, and walked about the Iland, albeit their wounds were not thorowly healed: which ſome-what offended them, &amp; made them (in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) ſcorne <hi>Aliarts</hi> wiſedome, as the like they did in fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudging the iſſue of the perillous battaile, handled at large in the end of the ſecond booke of this Hiſtory. But tenne dayes were not fully expired, till they found themſelues in better diſpoſition, ioying more entirely in each others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment.</p>
               <p>Nowe the Quéene <hi>Leonarda,</hi> ouer-charged with the irkſome panges of child-bearing, hauing foure dayes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther endured the bitter agonies incident thereto, was at length deliuered of a faire daughter named <hi>Victoria:</hi> who being no ſooner borne, but the weake Mother (folding her armes together, and lifting her eyes to heauen) departed this life. This her ſuddaine death, which the wiſe <hi>Aliart</hi> before ſuſpected not, very much troubled all the royall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany: but eſpecially <hi>Florian,</hi> who was wonderouſly ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:14347:11"/>
of her, he ranne about in ſuch fury, as at euery in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant he would haue ſlaine himſelfe, and he had done it, but that <hi>Palmerin, Pompides,</hi> and <hi>Aliart</hi> his brethren, were ſtill enforced to kéepe him company. At length, growing into extreame hate of the Iland, becauſe he had loſt the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his beloued <hi>Leonarda:</hi> one day taking <hi>Aliart</hi> aſide, he thus began.</p>
               <p>My Lord and brother, eyther giue me leaue to diſpatch my ſelfe, that I may not out-liue her, whoſe beauty reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred makes life loathſome to me: or let me depart this I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, to the end I may not ſée the place, which daily renu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the memory of my loue, wil vrge me but to the greater impatience. All the Princes liked wel this determination of <hi>Florian,</hi> who was not yet perfectly healed, albeit his dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity vſed in the battaile, hindered his hurts from being ſo déepe as others were, by meanes whereof he was the beſt recouered amongſt them all. All the Lords &amp; Ladies great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laboured to comfort <hi>Florian,</hi> &amp; pacifie his greefes, but all their endeuour amounted to nothing: for hée was ſo tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported with griefe &amp; paſſions, as he liued the moſt deſpiſed life that euer malcontent did. When <hi>Aliart</hi> made proofe of his Art and induſtry, and ſaw all was in vaine to remooue theſe humors: he prouided him a Ship, and cauſing him to put on like Armour as hée was went to weare, as alſo a ſhield with his former ſauage mans deuiſe: accompanied him foorth of the Iland, to the great griefe of all the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, eſpecially <hi>Don Edward</hi> his father, whoſe age made his wounds more offenſiue to him. His brethren would gladly haue borne him company, but hee (reiecting all comfort) would not permit them: ſo taking his leaue of them all, &amp; laſtly of <hi>Aliart,</hi> gone is he for all aduentures whatſoeuer. The griefe for <hi>Florians</hi> departure, was partly qualified, by ioy of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> princeſſes, who now were to behold y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fruits of their labors. <hi>Miragarda</hi> was deliuered of a ſon, ſo like her ſelfe, as in beauty he excelled all the youth of thoſe times, &amp; was named <hi>Oliuanto.

               <p>
                  <hi>Florian</hi> (as you haue heard) being parted from the Iland, with intent to come in no place of humane reſort, ſought with his Shippe to kéepe aloofe from land, where he might diſcerne either Citty or Caſtle: and holding on a ſolitary courſe of Nauigation, he came to a deſolate and ruined Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, ſo vnfrequented in his owne opinion, as he imagined himſelfe highly beholding to Fortune, for bringing him to a place ſo fitting his deſire. Héere going on ſhoare, he left the Ship, and becauſe he coueted to be alone, walked on into a Wood: where ouer-taken by the night, weary, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and burdened with many thoughts, he lay downe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a trée to repoſe himſelfe.

               <p>This was by a Néece of <hi>Eutropa,</hi> Aunt to <hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> who when <hi>Florian</hi> combated with her brother, became ſo enamoured of his valour, as euer afterward ſhe laboured to get hold of him, and make him tractable to her deſires: She being ſom-what ſkilfull in Magicall ſciences, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby, that <hi>Florian</hi> (after the death of <hi>Leonarda</hi>) was in deſperate humours departed from the <hi>Perillous Ile:</hi> by

The Damoſell being wiſe, was highly contented to haue him with her: perſwading her ſelfe, that hardly could hote young blood defend it ſelfe, from the ſwéete enticements of an amorous Lady. So ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him by the hand, ſhee conducted him to her Caſtle: where he was ſo gallantly entertayned by light of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as ſcant could he imagine how to deny loue to ſo gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle a creature. Being entred a goodly hall, he was ſeated at a table right againſt <hi>Dorina:</hi> who ſéeing him ſo often looke babies in her eyes, ſuppoſed him thorowly vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by her loue, making the leſſe account to vſe any more enchauntments. The houre being come of going to reſt,
<pb facs="tcp:14347:20"/>
a chamber moſt ſumptuouſly adorned was prepared for <hi>Florian:</hi> where by reaſon the night was very far ſpent, he laid him downe and ſlept right ſoundly. <hi>Dorina,</hi> eyther weary with ſo long watching that night, or making her ſelfe certainly aſſured, to be beloued where ſhe thought her ſelfe neuer enough pleaſed: would not then goe ſée him in bed, becauſe ſhe imagined not that a victory ſufficient. But ariſing the next morning, very richly decked, ſhe went to awake the Knight: who being glad he had no further that night béene tempted by the Lady; aroſe, with intent to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part thence, that hee might no more be aſſailed the next night following. But he found his hope fore-ſtalled, for as he iſſued foorth of his chamber, <hi>Targianaes</hi> Letter with the Ring came flying into his hand: the vertue whereof was ſuch, that ſuddainly he felt himſelfe enamoured on her that wrote it. So being further preſſed on by force of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chauntment, he went to the Stable, where mounting on horſe-backe, he departed without taking leaue of <hi>Dorina:</hi> who had no power to hinder him, by reaſon <hi>Druſa Velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naes</hi> Art was of ſuch perfection, as no other Magitian (how ſkilfull ſo euer) could withſtand it.</p>

But <hi>Florian,</hi> whoſe thoughts were buſied
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:14347:21"/>
howe to deliuer <hi>Targiana,</hi> perceiuing that <hi>Riſtorano</hi> (fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſhe ſhould be recouered by the people) had manned her with a very ſtrong guard, when hee heard the <hi>Armenian</hi> Princeſſe was ſent to <hi>Sucuſano,</hi> intended an enterpriſe (o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-venturous indeede) but that hee was ſtill fauourablie protected by <hi>Dorina,</hi> who in ſo many perrils gaue him help. And this was his determination, to take y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Princeſſe forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly from them that conducted her to <hi>Sucuſano:</hi> ſo to procure warre betwéene the Turkes and Perſians, when reſtoring her againe to them (his owne turne beeing ſerued) it muſt needes ſort to eyther of their contentments. Making thys knowne to <hi>Targiana,</hi> who not imagining what to hope of this doubtfull enterpriſe, remained betweene ioy &amp; feare: but referring all to the good or ill ſucceſſe, ſent him worde, that he ſhould compaſſe what euer he thought good for her eſcape.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Florian</hi> arming himſelfe for the purpoſe, went to purſue the tract of the <hi>Armenian</hi> Princeſſe, who by an hundred Turkes was ſent toward her brother, and béeing come to them, he cryed: Abyde, and let goe the Lady, except ye all meane to die by my hand.</p>
               <p>The Captaine of theſe Turkes, who was a man verie arrogant: turning to his followers, ſayde: This fellowe ſéemes as though he would fight with men made of ſtrawe, that he is ſo liberall (at firſt ſight) in his threatnings, but we ſhall ſee what he can doe: then turning to him, he thus ſpake. Braue man, I will try my ſelfe with thée, becauſe I will not ſée ſo many of mine perriſh by thy ſtrong hand: but yet thus I condition, that if thou ouer-come mee, thou ſhalt leade me whether thou pleaſeſt: but if I foyle thée, Ile keepe thée as my laughing ſtock, to ſmile at in my bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Florian</hi> hearing himſelfe thus ſcorned, in déepe diſdaine (without ſpeaking a worde) turned his horſe, and met the proude Turke on the breaſt with ſuch an incounter, as his Launce ran a handfull &amp; more thorow his ſhoulder, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he tombled dead to the ground. When his followers
<pb facs="tcp:14347:22"/>
ſaw their Captaine ſo ſuddainly falne, and remembring how this ſtrange Knight had threatned them all, without any regard of ſhame, they ranne altogether fiercely vppon him, ſome wounding him, others his horſe, becauſe hee ſhould haue no meanes to eſcape.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Florian</hi> beeing on foote, and wounded, ſéeing death imminent before him, leant his ſhoulder againſt an olde withered trée, minding yet to ſell his life a little déerer. And byding the battell for a good ſpace, he grew ſo wearie, as nothing was to be expected but death: if enamored <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rina,</hi> who had no power to kill him, had not at his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture intended eſpeciall care of him. And albeit by her arte ſhée vnderſtoode, what effect the Letter and Ring had wrought, as alſo that <hi>Florian</hi> afreſh ſollicited by his former loue borne to <hi>Targiana,</hi> endeuoured greatly for her deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: notwithſtanding all hope of euer enioying him, the more reſolued and ſoundly grewe her affection to loue him. Now ſeeing in what perrill he was to looſe his life, by reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuing the <hi>Armenian</hi> Princeſſe from the Turkes handes: ſhee changed her ſelfe into the ſhape of <hi>Palmerin</hi> of <hi>England</hi> his brother, prouided of horſe and armour accordingly, and aloude ſhée cryed to <hi>Florian,</hi> ſaying: Feare not Brother, I am come hether for thy defence: ſo placing herſelfe by him, performed ſuch deedes of valour, as the Turkes began to retyre, as reſolued that thys Knight would be the death of them all. But becauſe <hi>Florian</hi> had loſt much blood, ſhe gaue helpe to mount himſelfe vpon his horſe, that he ſate behind toward the crupper, and ſo the <hi>Armenian</hi> Princeſſe was placed before him: and ſhe was ſo ſuddainly carried thence into a wood, as the Turkiſh Knights ſtoode in amazement thereat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dorina,</hi> when ſhée had <hi>Florian</hi> ſafe from his enemies, ſhewed her ſelfe to him what ſhe was: and perceiuing that hée affected not the <hi>Armenian</hi> Princeſſe, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of her, ſhee thus ſpake to him. Moſt gentle Knight, loue, that hath made mee altogether yours, enforceth an opinion contrary to all hope, of ioy, when no likelihood is
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:14347:22"/>
that euer it will be: for I knowe yee to be enamoured of a Ladie, who ſtrictly by enchauntment bindes ye to loue her, when perhaps her beautie might faile in other meanes of preuailing, all which makes me the more deſirous of yee: and to witneſſe my inward inflamed loue, ſée heere the wound I gaue on this breaſt with my knife, as willing to haue ſlaine my ſelfe vpon your vnkinde departure.</p>
               <p>The Lady was young and beautifull, her wordes like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe vttered ſo effectually, as <hi>Florian</hi> woulde haue yeelded her loue, if the other enchauntment had béene no let there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. But he vnable to vſe any mercie to her, and the Ladie (béeing wiſe) conſidering all this was occaſioned by the Ring, determined to awaite fitter opportunitie, till <hi>Florian</hi> ſhould be releaſed from that enchauntment, and taking or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that one of her Damoſels ſhould cure his wounds, ſhée thus beganne againe. Thou canſt not let me from louing thee for euer, albeit thou takeſt no pitty on mine affliction: and ſo ſhe departed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Florian,</hi> without regarding her ſpeeches, ſuffered what ſoeuer was applyed for his recouerie: and by reaſon <hi>Dori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> holpe him by her arte, in foure daies he was able to ſitte his horſe againe. Then conferring with the <hi>Armenian</hi> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, he excuſed what had béene done in hindering her from her brother <hi>Sucuſano,</hi> diſcloſing likewiſe what he was, as alſo to what end this iniurie was offered her, as not able by any meanes elſe to redéeme <hi>Targiana.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It diſpleaſed the Princeſſe, that thus her returne into Perſia was fore-ſtalled, but when ſhee knew him to be the Prince <hi>Florian,</hi> ſo farre famed, and noted withall his gentle behauiour, ſhe accounted her ſelfe indebted to Fortune, for letting her fal thus into his hands, with whoſe loue ſhe felt herſelfe ſuddenly amated. Then remembring that ſhe ſent the ring in <hi>Targianaes</hi> name, ſhe had little hope of winning him to her loue, ſo long as that enchantment laſted: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe pacified herſelfe, and <hi>Florian</hi> deſirous to returne to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Tubante,</hi> had newe Armour and horſes for conduct of the Princeſſe, all right after the <hi>Tartarian</hi> manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14347:23"/>And this was doone by <hi>Dorina,</hi> that <hi>Florian</hi> might goe backe to <hi>Tubante,</hi> and was not knowne to be he that fought with the Turkes in reſcue of the Princeſſe: whoſe habite was likewiſe in ſuch ſort tranſ-formed, as none in all the cittie could know her. Thus béeing in <hi>Tubante,</hi> often times hee ſhewed himſelfe to <hi>Targiana</hi> by meanes of his greene plume, but hee could no further preuaile, becauſe of the watchfull guard appointed by <hi>Riſtorano,</hi> for which (good Lady) ſhée was euen ready to die. And the <hi>Armenian</hi> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe ſo curbd in her gréefe, that ſhe might not enioy the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of <hi>Florians</hi> loue: as day and night ſhe offered to ſléepe by him, yet would hee mooue towards her no more then a ſtone.</p>

               <p>When <hi>Florian</hi> ſaw what he deſired to take ſuch effect, he earneſtly intreated the Princeſſe of <hi>Armenia,</hi> that faining her ſelfe to be eſcaped from the Knight who tooke her from the Turkes, ſhee would get into the Caſtle where <hi>Targia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> was, ſo might ſhe be out of danger of her owne life, and a meane likewiſe of <hi>Targianas</hi> libertie. The Princeſſe ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her brother ſo neere to deliuer her, and louing <hi>Florian</hi> ſo earneſtly as ſhe did, was well contented to performe his requeſt: ſo ſlipping with him foorth of the Citty, entred a wood neere adioyning, where letting her horſe run looſe on his bridle, like one eſcaped from an enemy, ſhee entred the
<pb facs="tcp:14347:24"/>

And comming to <hi>Targiana,</hi> ſo artificially ſhe continued her feigned feare: as ſhee verily imagined her to bee eſcaped from <hi>Florian.</hi> But when time came that they might more ſafely conuerſſe together, ſhee then reuealed all: whereby <hi>Targianaes</hi> hope very greatly increaſed, ſeeing now an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance to her freedome ſo ſoundly begun.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Florian</hi> perceiuing that the Princeſſe was got into the Caſtle, and hauing with his preſence (a farre off) comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Targiana,</hi> armed Turke-like, he went and offered his ſeruice to <hi>Sucuſano,</hi> who ſéeing him ſo brauely diſpoſed, and but young withall, would needes haue him ſit downe by him, but <hi>Florian</hi> dooing him double reuerence, beganne in this manner. Moſt mightie Lord, I am ſonne to a Turke, who ſerued moſt faithfully the great Emperour deceaſſed, and thereby receiued of him no meane benefits.

Let me then entreat your highneſſe, to doe ſome-what for ſo great a ſiſter as your owne, and my Soueraigne: wherein, beſide eternall fame following ſo glorious an enterpriſe, ſhée will acknowledge herſelfe deeply indebted vnto you, when ſhe ſhall be ſeated in her kingdoms of <hi>Babilon</hi> and <hi>Turkie.</hi> And might it pleaſe yee but to fauour me in thys enterpriſe, I offer my ſelfe bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to bodie, againſt ſo many as dare maintaine <hi>Riſtorano</hi> to be no traytour: truſting more in iuſtice of the cauſe, then any hardiment or valour in my ſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sucuſano</hi> very reſpectiuely noted <hi>Florian</hi> all the while he ſpake, and iudging him to be a man very valiant, replyed: that ſeeing him ſo loyally inclined towards his princeſſe, he woulde gladly haue both the Ladies ſet at libertie, becauſe his ſiſter was likewiſe priſoner with her, and therefore hee
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:14347:24"/>

And in regard a Turkiſh Knight, backt by Perſians, would fight againſt the Citty, and requeſted combate: he intended to prouide for the preſent perrill, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencing the Embaſſadour to depart, ſaying: His Siſter he had already ſent him, but with <hi>Targiana</hi> he had not to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle. The Embaſſador bringing this aunſwere to his Lord, and <hi>Florian</hi> beeing aduertiſed thereof, made haſt to the field, to looſe no time, and leaſt the <hi>Perſians</hi> mind ſhould hap to be changed: hearing that his ſiſter had beene ſent him before, and taken from the Knights, as hath béen before declared.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Riſtorano,</hi> fearing no leſſe the Turkes then the Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, turning him to his Knights, ſaid: Which of you dare goe combat this companion, &amp; bring his head to me? Many valiant Lords profered themſelues in haſt, and great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention there was who ſhould goe firſt: but the lot falling to the Prince of <hi>Tharſus,</hi> he armed himſelfe for the purpoſe, and came ſo diſdainfully forth of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Citty, that without ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any word to <hi>Florian,</hi> hee ranne againſt him with his Launce: wherewith <hi>Florian</hi> being mooued, met him in the midſt of the courſe, the Turkes ſtaffe hitting on his ſhielde, made him looſe a ſtirrop, but <hi>Florians</hi> paſſed with ſuch force through his breaſt, that he fel downe dead to the earth. The <hi>Perſians</hi> ſeeing a victory ſo eaſily obtained, both ioyed &amp; mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed thereat. Contrariwiſe, they of the citty ſtood amazed.
<pb facs="tcp:14347:25"/>
Neuertheleſſe, the Lord of <hi>Antioche,</hi> (a man of great mind and opinion) preſented himſelfe, &amp; encountring with <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</hi> hurt him a little on the arme, albeit himſelfe had ſuch a ſalutation on the pate, as he was liker to lie along, then keepe his ſaddle. Then <hi>Florian</hi> determining, either to die this day, or regaine <hi>Targiana,</hi> ſmote at him with his ſword, which lighting on his ſhoulder, cleft him downe to the ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and cut off his horſes head likewiſe.</p>
               <p>This was ſuch a fearefull aſtoniſhment to <hi>Riſtoranos</hi> Knights, as no more beeing willing to aduenture them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, they drewe backe into the Citty: where <hi>Riſtorano</hi> (fearefull of the people) ſought by what meanes <hi>Targiana</hi> might be ſlaine, as alwaies before hee aymed thereat: but becauſe he knew not who to truſt, and ſawe euery one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to fauour their naturall Soueraigne, hee reſolued with himſelfe vppon ſpéedie flight. Then hearing what a great rumor was at the walls, the Perſians fully perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of ſucceſſe, hauing him for their Captaine, who had ſo ſoone ouer-come two ſuch valiant Turkes, hée drew neere (with diuers of his truſtieſt folowers) to make head againſt them, &amp; going to a falſe poſterne of the Caſtle, cauſed <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giana</hi> to be fetched foorth, that he might haue her along with him: hoping in extremitie, to yeeld her for ſafegarde of his owne life, or elſe by béeing ſtill poſſeſt of her, to haue vſe and gouernment of the ſtate.</p>
               <p>This could he not performe ſo ſecretly, but hee was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered by the people, who cryed out with loud voyce, that <hi>Targiana</hi> was led away to death: whereon he was purſued by ſo great multitudes, that hee (hauing worke enough to doe to eſcape aliue, and knowing howe fewe of his owne people did affect him,) left <hi>Targiana</hi> behinde him. Some fearing leaſt the Citty ſhould bee taken and ſpoyled by the Perſians, hung foorth their flagge of truce, and opening the gate, receiued in <hi>Florian</hi> and foure thouſand Knights with him, according as <hi>Sucuſano</hi> had before appoynted, who behaued himſelfe on the other ſide very valiantly. But <hi>Florian</hi> fearing leaſt ſome diſaſter ſhoulde betide <hi>Targiana,</hi>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:14347:25"/>
ranne preſently to the Caſtell, where he found her in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of them that <hi>Riſtorano</hi> left her withall, who percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the Tyrant fledde, laboured to kéepe her from perrill, and ſo were returned backe with her thither againe. Of him they grewe all afraide, and in danger had they béene, but that <hi>Targiana</hi> knewe him by managing his weapon, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtepping forward: Sheath your ſword my Lord (quoth ſhee) for theſe Knights are for my ſafetie, and at your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Florian,</hi> ſéeing his intent accompliſhed, full of ioy, tooke <hi>Targiana</hi> by the hand, but ſhee trembled, as ſhewing the great loue ſhee bare him, from the beginning when he was in her Court. Thence was ſhée conducted by the people to her Pallace, and béeing placed in the royall ſeate of her Father, was publiquely proclaimed and confirmed theyr Queene.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sucuſano,</hi> glad for recouerie of his Siſter, and that hee had doone ſo ſpeciall ſeruice to <hi>Targiana,</hi> without the loſſe of any of his people, entred that night into the Citty, with an hundred of his worthieſt Barons: and becauſe it was late, as then hée could not goe to ſée the Ladie, by reaſon <hi>Targiana</hi> had withdrawne herſelfe aſide, none in her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie but Prince <hi>Florian,</hi> as not béeing able to ſatiſ-fie her ſelfe with embracing him, and yéelding him thanks, as his great paines had well deſerued.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Emperor <hi>Primaleon,</hi> beeing thorowly healed of his wounds, had yet his right arme benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in ſuch ſort, as it was great paine to him to vſe his ſworde, and little helpe any way coulde it yeeld vnto him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Don Edward,</hi> by meanes of a wound receiued through his necke, held his head awry, leaning to one ſhoulder, ſo that it gréeued him to beare armour thereon.

                  <hi>Aliart,</hi> ſéeing theſe Lordes ſo mindfull of their ſeuerall homes, ſitting one day conuerſing with them, hee entred into theſe ſpeeches. Great Princes, I reioyce that mine own arte hath ſo deceiued me, which made me beléeue, that all you ſhould die in the paſſed warre, and <hi>Constantinople</hi> fall into the Pagans power: but moſt of all this deceite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth me, that I behold yee ſo well recouered, and the <hi>Grecian</hi> Empire yet at libertie. Therefore you ſhall doo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie well, that each of you returne to his proper ſtate, to giue order for prouiding men in readines, and fortefying your Citties: becauſe it may ſo fall out, that the Heathen renu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their forces, will on a ſuddaine ſeeke your endamage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Emperour <hi>Primaleon</hi> very glad héereof, cauſed a Galley to be made ready, when calling all the Princes and widdowed Ladies, with large proteſtations, hee gaue them thanks for the loſſe they had ſuffered to maintaine his eſtate: offering himſelfe for euer a Father to the widdows, as alſo a defender of them and their children. So embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing altogether, hee went aboard, with <hi>Florendos, Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roll, Dramuſiande,</hi> and their Ladies, who greatly deſired to viſite their owne homes, and to be in their former eſtate of dignitie.</p>
               <p>As they were ſetting off from the ſhoare, they deſcryed a little Barque a farre off, which (as ſwift as a byrd) came flying toward them: they expecting what it might be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held it no ſooner néere neighboured with them, but thereout leaped the moſt miſhapen olde woman, that euer in anie time had béene ſeene: ſhée making toward the Emperour, who as yet ſtoode vpon the decke, thus ſpake. Moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Lord, meruaile not that I appeare ſo ſpent with yéeres, and yet at this inſtant hazard thus the perrill of my life, for the cauſe of my preſent comming hether, is to make proofe among thy Knights, of an aduenture which holdes theſe conditions, that who ſoeuer can finiſh it, ſhal haue promiſe of a boone from mée: but attempting &amp; failing, is preſently to goe along with mée. The Emperour, who was loth to ſee any of his oppoſe themſelues to perrill, being not yet ſo
<pb facs="tcp:14347:27"/>
ſtrong and luſtie, as when they attempted the laſt dreadful battaile, thus anſwered. Perhaps the late vnfortunate bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile is not knowne to thee, wherein the moſt woorthy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all Chriſtian Princes haue periſhed: and wee that yet remaine are in ſo weake eſtate, as I could gladly wiſh thee chuſe ſome other time, both more fit for thee and them in this caſe.</p>
               <p>The old Woman, very diſdainfully, and with a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce ſeeming none of the beſt, thus ſpake to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. Bleſſed for euer be the conſtancie of the royall Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Palmerine,</hi> that neuer made ſhew of any baſeneſſe, albeit himſelfe paſt through many miſeries. Theſe words ſo pierced the Emperours princely minde, that his choller ariſing, he craued pardon of the old woman for his vnkind aunſwere: deſiring her to declare the aduenture. Then ſhe withdrew herſelfe toward the Barque, ſhewing as if ſhee were gréeued beyond compariſon, for not hauing founde what ſhée ſought in ſo many Princes Courts: yet beeing ſtill mooued by his highneſſe intreates, and <hi>Don Edwards</hi> likewiſe, who would not leaue her, ſhee drewe the ſmall Barque alande, vſing certaine wordes to her ſelfe: when ſuddainly iſſued foorth a Monſter of very ſtrange ſhape, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the head of a Serpent, the necke of a Lyon, the bodie of a Bull, the feete of a Horſe, and the tayle deuided in two parts, ſo piercing withall, as it woulde paſſe through anie Armour. With this beaſt (quoth the hagge) muſt thy Knights combat, vnder condition before expreſſed: ſo many as ſhall be vanquiſhed by it, muſt goe with me to an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe as honourable, as pleaſing to themſelues.</p>

The young Lord, glad of ſo ſpeciall a fauour, hoping beſide of glorious victorie, came foorth armed, with his ſword ready drawne, and drawing neere the Monſter, ſmote him ouer the heade with his ſword: but he found it ſo impiercible, and rather damageable to his weapon, as he grew doubtfull of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, belonging to this enterpriſe. Neuertheleſſe, turning againe to the beaſt, he was caught within the deuided taile, and throwne thrée times about ſo furiouſly, as his memory failing him, he fell to the ground greatly aſtonied. But hée beeing of a very valiant ſpirit, quickly recouered footing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and offered once more to make proofe of himſelfe: but the old Woman thus preuented him.</p>
               <p>No more Sir Knight, becauſe if well yee vnderſtand mée, the condition by mée propounded was thus: that if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie Knight were ouer-throwne by the Monſter, hee ſhould be admitted to fight no longer. The Emperour perceiuing the olde Womans intent, gaue a ſigne to <hi>Dirdan</hi> that hee ſhould with-draw himſelfe, and <hi>Don Edward</hi> cauſed <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pides</hi> to preſent himſelfe: who very boldly aſſailed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter with his ſworde, reaching him ſuch a thruſt in the flanke, as wel neere had made him to tumble ouer. But the beaſt gaue him ſuch a blow on the breaſt with his foote, as made him fall downe backward: Whereat each one both greeued and meruailed, ſéeing two ſo good Knights ſo ſoone diſabled.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dragonalte,</hi> by <hi>Don Edwards</hi> licence, was the next that aſſayled the Monſter, and hee beeing very nimble at all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantages, gaue the beaſt diuers hurts, which (by reaſon of his ſlothfulneſſe) hée coulde not ſhunne: But catching at length the ſworde betweene his teeth, ſnatcht it out of his hand, and made at him ſo furiouſly, that ſtriking him rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie againſt the ground, very hardly could hee ariſe to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe himſelfe. <hi>Floraman,</hi> hauing receiued his ſigne from <hi>Don Edward,</hi> deliuered many rough ſtrokes to the Monſter, but coulde not by anie meanes wounde him:
<pb facs="tcp:14347:28"/>
and trauerſing about to kéepe him foorth of danger, ſtill v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his ſword for his beſt aduantage, at length hee was caught betweene the monſters taile, which caſt him vp the height of a Launce, when falling downe, he lay as if he had béene dead, to the great griefe of euery one, who doubted leaſt this ſtrange aduenture, would ſerue as a ſhame to the <hi>Grecian</hi> Court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Edward,</hi> fearing this monſter would ſley ſome of the Knights, called for <hi>Palmerin,</hi> who ſtaying a little to gird on his ſword, was preuented by <hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> who though he ſtoode before as one amazed, meruailing at theſe ſtrange encounters: pricked forward by valour, hee ſette himſelfe againſt the beaſt, and not ſéeking how to hurt him otherwiſe, caught faſt holde on his great tayle, which hee held ſo ſtrongly, as the beaſt could not recouer it from him: for ſuch was the Giants greatnes, as hee could neither lift him vp, nor caſt him downe. During this contention, to the great paines of <hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> who woulde not let goe the tayle, neither could haue other kinde of victorie: euery one was very penſiue, not knowing what iſſue of theſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires to hope for. <hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> endeuouring with all his ſtrength to caſt the monſter, became ſo wearied, as he was not able to ſtriue any longer: whereupon, entring into better aduiſe, with a leape hee threwe himſelfe vppon the beaſts backe, and holding him with his hande at the vaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the chaine, gaue him ſuch prouokings with his legs, as the monſter to be diſburdened of ſo great a weight, ran to the ſhoare ſide, &amp; at one ſkip mounted into the Sea: where <hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> not terrified with feare, though hee beheld himſelfe but dead as it were, kept ſtill his holde vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the beaſt, as if afterward he ſhould chaunce to leape on ſhoare againe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arlencea,</hi> when ſhée beheld her huſband in this danger, for whom ſhe had ſhed ſo many teares when he was repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted dead: fell on her knees at the olde womans féete, &amp; thus beſpake her.

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:14347:28"/>
The olde woman, hearing herſelfe coniured in thys manner, beeing herſelfe (as you ſhall heare) deeply enamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, made a ſigne, and the monſter mounted backe with <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> into the Barque, which ſtood ready for pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe at the Land-ſide. Afterward, by her arte ſhee cauſed the other foure Knights that receiued the foyle, to be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in likewiſe conuayed: then entring the Barque herſelfe, ſhée launched ſo far into the Sea, as ſhee could be but heard to ſpeake in this manner.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I muſt haue theſe Knights with me, becauſe I may by good reaſon claime them, and <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> ſhall beare them company likewiſe, for I am <hi>Dorina</hi> his Cooſin, that preſerued him, as now your ſelues haue beheld: him haue I great occaſions to employ in, and ſhortly ſhall hee returne againe in the ſame eſtate, as when hee was young and eyghteene yéeres old.

The Lady, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> abhorred him more then death, ſhewed herſelfe ſo diſdainfull, as the <hi>Perſian</hi> beganne to perſwade himſelfe, that the Ladies thoughts were elſe-where addic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>Betwéene this loue and diſdaine, ſtept in the <hi>Armenian</hi> Princeſſe, who ſéeing <hi>Targiana</hi> ſo ſcornful toward her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, knowing alſo what had paſt betweene her and <hi>Flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> her thoughts labouring twixt loue and hatred, would, (and yet ſhe would not) declare to <hi>Sucuſano</hi> what <hi>Florian</hi> was, whom hee imagined to be a Turke. Continuing in
<pb facs="tcp:14347:30"/>
theſe imaginations, a matter hapned, that made her ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie with <hi>Targiana,</hi> and thus it was. <hi>Targiana</hi> one day bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied about affaires concerning the eſtate, the <hi>Armenian</hi> Princeſſe finding <hi>Florian</hi> alone and penſiue: reputing her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe no way inferiour to <hi>Targiana</hi> in beautie, ſhe came and ſate downe by him, entring into theſe ſpeeches. Knewe I not that your ſelfe hath made proofe of loues ſoueraigne for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, I ſhould forbeare to reaſon with you in amourous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe: but your gentlenes, and my hard fortune conſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, that albeit I know your thoughts are deuoted to <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giana,</hi> yet muſt I intreat one graunt of loue, yéelding my ſelfe wholie to your power. And as ſhee deliuered theſe words, a ſea of teares ſtreamed from her eyes, her hart ſtil trembling, expecting his aunſwers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Florian,</hi> ouercome with gréefe, for the loue he ſawe <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſano</hi> vſe toward <hi>Targiana,</hi> made her no reply: and ſhee (by his ſilence) conceiuing ſome hope that hee would loue her, threw her armes about his neck, when it hapned that <hi>Targiana</hi> (hauing ended her buſines) ſuddainly ſtept in, and ſéeing in her ſuch vnſeemely behauiour, thus ſpake. Ah ſhameleſſe Damoſell, whether hath thy luxurious appetite tranſported, thus to inſult vppon anothers right? And into worſer termes would ſhe haue growne, but that the Ladie (as one confounded) without returning any anſwere, ſtept forth of the Chamber, leauing both them ſo aſtoniſhed, as neither of them well knew what to ſay: eſpecially <hi>Florian,</hi> who conſidering the great perrill and doubt wherein <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giana</hi> ſtoode at this inſtant, had not the power to comfort her, himſelfe being oppreſſed with what he moſt feared.</p>
               <p>The Princeſſe of <hi>Armenia,</hi> conceiuing déepe diſdaine at <hi>Targianas</hi> wordes, and ſeeing herſelfe deſpiſed by <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</hi> went directly to her Brother, and there declared, that the diſſembled Turke, who had doone ſo much for <hi>Targia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> was Prince <hi>Florian</hi> of the Forreſt, termed the Knight of the <hi>Sauage man:</hi> who was maried to <hi>Targiana,</hi> not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by his hand her former huſband <hi>Albayzar</hi> was ſlaine, yet had ſhe made a laſciuious choyſe of him.</p>

                  <hi>Sucuſano</hi> perceiuing within his power, the very greateſt enemie that Heatheneſſe had, reputed himſelfe moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie, ſaying: Since <hi>Targiana</hi> had committed an offence ſo vnpardonable, hee thought her vnwoorthy to be his wife. But becauſe he would not looſe ſo rich a bootie, hee cauſed the chamber to be round engirt where <hi>Florian</hi> was, whence <hi>Targiana</hi> but little before was angerly departed, and was buſilie talking with certaine of her chiefeſt Barons, howe <hi>Sucuſano</hi> intended to take away her Kingdome from her. The <hi>Perſians</hi> beeing entring the Chamber, aſſailed <hi>Flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> finding him vnarmed, but onely with his Rapier: nor ſought they to kill him, but thronged round about him, to take him aliue, ſo in the end he was bound, &amp; carried forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to <hi>Sucuſano.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Targiana,</hi> hearing the rumour and noyſe, ranne to the Chamber, and diuers with her, whom ſhee had made to arme themſelues: but ouer-late was her comming, for they had thence conueied her louer, and doubting nowe what might become of him, attyring herſelfe like a man, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with an auncient Knight, ſhee got preſently foorth of the Citty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sucuſano</hi> hauing thus gotten <hi>Florian,</hi> intended a ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne reuenge, for all the iniuries before receiued, but yet hee was much offended, that he had not <hi>Targiana:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hée ſent to ſearch the Pallace, and not finding her, hee vnderſtood by a Damoſell committed to torment, that two howres before, ſhee was departed in habite of a man, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing diuers other ſignes beſide, whereby ſhe might be ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt knowne.</p>
               <p>Nowe was not the <hi>Perſian</hi> ſlacke in ſending foorth his Knights by ſundry wayes, to purſue her, that they might bring her backe againe vnto him: and perceiuing howe the Turkes were addicted in loue to her, hee mindid as yet no violence toward her, till firſt hee were fully poſſeſſe of her Kingdome: then hee concluded to ſatiſ-fie his luſt with her, and afterward (to deſpight her the more) to giue her as a ſpoyle to his very worſt boy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14347:31"/>The Knights poſting about euery way, toward Sun-ſetting, they found her by a Fountaine, where (being wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with riding) ſhée ſtept aſide to refreſh herſelfe, mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to haue ridden all that night. When ſhee beheld her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ouertaken by the <hi>Perſians,</hi> without any on her behalfe to make reſiſtance, ſhée was ſo ſtrangly diſtracted with gréefe, as the Knights ſetting her on horſe-backe, had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried her more then a mile, before ſhée made any ſigne of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiuing: but béeing come to herſelfe, ſhee vttered y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wofulſt lamentations that euer was heard from any Lady.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Knights that had the charge of <hi>Targiana,</hi> not ſuſpecting anie thing, rode on diſorderly, ieſting among themſelues to delight the Ladie. But <hi>Dorina,</hi> who knew the ſucceſſe of all that had happened, qualified her courſe of nauigation in ſuch ſort, as ſhe made choyce of time for deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of <hi>Targiana.</hi> And this ſhe did, to the end <hi>Sucuſano</hi> might not prooue the marriage by her teſtimonie, that ſhe had taken <hi>Florian</hi> to her huſband: for the <hi>Perſian</hi> (by this accuſation) might lawfully depriue her of her kingdome, and put <hi>Florian</hi> to death as he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, though the Turkes knew nothing what he was before his taking.</p>
               <p>Afterward, when they vnderſtood more of him, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the ſeruice hee had doone their Soueraigne, they would not conſent that hee ſhould bee ſlaine: but rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly deſired, he might ſafely be ſent into Chriſtendome, becauſe they had receiued certaine tydings from <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> that the Emperour <hi>Primaleon,</hi> with all the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous men at Armes, were aliue and recouered. But when it was tolde, that <hi>Targiana</hi> their Quéene had made thys Knight her huſband, with promiſe likewiſe to refuſe her fayth: they would preſently haue both him and her torne in a thouſand peeces. <hi>Dorina</hi> then, that <hi>Florian</hi> might not perriſh by this occaſion, bethought her on theſe Knights, ſuſpecting what danger was like to enſue, &amp; brought them (as you haue heard) from the <hi>Perilous Ile,</hi> conducting them
<pb facs="tcp:14347:32"/>
on to the reſt of the enterpriſe. And hauing particulerlie conferred with <hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> knowing the eſpeciall loue he bare to <hi>Florian,</hi> who had aduentured many perrills for him: ſhee would not diſcloſe that he had married <hi>Targiana,</hi> but laboured him with earneſt perſwaſions, that nowe hee would ſtand her louer in ſome ſteede, euen as hee had anie pittie of her, ſhewing him likewiſe the wounde ſhee gaue her ſelfe, when <hi>Florian</hi> ſo vngentlie departed from her Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> who well knew how intirely ſhe affected the Prince, had compaſſion on her, and promiſed his vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt on her behalfe: but (in his opinion) it would very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle auaile her, ſuch was his conceit for loſſe of the Princeſſe <hi>Leonarda,</hi> after whoſe death deſperatly hee left the <hi>Perilous Ile.</hi> So bringing her Barque on ſhoare, ſhee mounted all the Knights, diſguiſing them after the Turkiſh manner, to the end they might (without ſuſpition) fall in companie of <hi>Targiana.</hi> From midnight rode on theſe fiue Knights, till morning appeared, and then they ouertooke the <hi>Perſians,</hi> as they were entring at a ſecrete gate of the Caſtell, that <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giana</hi> might not publiquely be ſeene of the Turkes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> getting neere <hi>Targiana,</hi> lifting vp his beuer, ſpake to her in the Greeke tongue, (which ſhée very well vnderſtoode, by meanes of her aboade in the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Court:) Feare not Lady, for héere is come in your defence <hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> with theſe foure Knights of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> Court: ſo taking her by the arme, ſet her before him on his ſaddle.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Perſians</hi> ſeeing onely fiue Knights take the Ladie from them, ranne all to aſſaile <hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> on whom they had beſtowed manie Launces, but that they feared to kill <hi>Targiana,</hi> whom they had ſpeciall charge to bring backe aliue, yet receiued ſhée a little hurt on her backe. <hi>Floraman, Pompides, Dragonalte,</hi> and <hi>Dirdan,</hi> circkling her about, defended her all the way toward the Caſtel, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with forcible ſtrokes many <hi>Perſians.</hi> The croude was ſo great, that very hardly coulde they get onward, yet get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

neerer the Caſtell ſide, one of the Guarde, who ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time had beene Page to <hi>Targiana,</hi> knew her by her habite, and crying, Behold our Princeſſe, without longer ſtay, let downe the Bridge, when <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> and his foure com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, though well neere wearied with vſing their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, got themſelues vppon it: and <hi>Dorina</hi> (by her arte) hauing the gate readie open, permitted them entrance, but aboue an hundred <hi>Perſians</hi> entred with them, who ſtanding in feare of theyr Lord <hi>Sucuſano,</hi> if they did not bring back <hi>Targiana</hi> with them: co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded to regaine her aliue or dead, for ere long an infinite number more would come to aſſiſt them, becauſe all the <hi>Perſian</hi> Campe was hereon in an vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roare.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> hauing gotten in the Princeſſe, returned on the Bridge with a mightie Mace in his hand, which hée found by chaunce at the entrance of the gate: and dealing his blowes about him, ſo many hee ſent headlong into the Ditch, that the reſt beholding their manifeſt perrill, were gladde to giue backe: ſo the Bridge was drawne vp, euen as <hi>Sucuſano</hi> (hearing of theſe newes) came thether with the flower of all his Armie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dirdan,</hi> and the other Knights, with the men of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtell, gaue ſuch entertainement to the Perſians which got in with them, as they diſpatcht them all, not leauing one aliue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Targiana,</hi> when ſhee had conſidered with herſelfe, that thorowe want of victuals ſhee could not keepe long in that Caſtell: ſhee went to the gate next to the Cittie, where cauſing a Trumpet to be ſounded, great concourſe of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was immediatly aſſembled, and ſhee comming herſelfe vpon the Porte, ſpake to them in thys manner. You ſee (my faythfull friendes and louing Countrimen) howe <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſano,</hi> vrging falſe ſlaunders againſt mee, hath ſought to inflict ſharpe torments on mee, to make mée confeſſe what neuer entred into my thoughts, and afterward (by that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe) vniuſtlie to defeate mee of my lawful right and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and to enioy it himſelfe. I am certaine, that you
<pb facs="tcp:14347:33"/>
would not willingly be vnder the <hi>Perſian</hi> gouernment, and my ſelfe doubting you ſhoulde bee in ſubiection to forraine rule: will rather yeeld the kingdome to <hi>Riſtorano,</hi> who is of the royall progenie of your owne Princes. Now, ſeeing in what eſtate I am, if you reſpect my life, haue care of me and of theſe Knights, who haue aduentured themſelues for defence of my libertie: and becauſe ye are likewiſe behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Florian,</hi> who (onely mooued by his owne gentle na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) put himſelfe into ſo many perrils, to deliuer me from impriſonment: goe therefore with your power to the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, ſo ſoone as ye ſhall be conducted the way, and frée him from priſon, that enfranchiſed your Quéene.</p>
               <p>By chaunce there was then preſent in hearing heereof, a great Signior of <hi>Antioch,</hi> beeing ſubiect to the Crowne of <hi>Turkie,</hi> who bearing ſome affection to <hi>Targiana,</hi> and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining, by accompliſhing a ſeruice of ſuch import, it was the readieſt way to attaine her loue: forth-with hee called together a very ſufficient troope, and to the Pallace they went, where they could not finde <hi>Florian,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> (doubtful of maintaining themſelues in the Citty) had ſecretly led him with them to their Campe. Which tidings greatly diſpleaſed <hi>Targiana</hi> and the Knights, but eſpecially <hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> who was ready to die with conceit of greefe. Now becauſe the <hi>Perſians</hi> had forſaken the Cittie, they iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed foorth of the Caſtell, leauing <hi>Targiana</hi> &amp; <hi>Floraman</hi> ſtill to keepe it, ſo running to the Pallace, they gaue order for defence of the walls: intending likewiſe to aduertiſe the Emperour of theſe affaires thus happening in <hi>Turkie,</hi> but by reaſon of the multitude of <hi>Perſian</hi> horeſemen, as yet they knew not how to compaſſe the meanes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> to ſhewe what perrill ſhould enſue on <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſano,</hi> if hee durſt put to death the Knight of the <hi>Sauage man,</hi> went armed into the fielde to demaund battaile: car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying this opinion, that if he could kill any great Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the fielde, or take them priſoners, he ſhould vrge diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>may in the reſt, and ſo the eaſier recouer his friende. The <hi>Perſians</hi> hearing the battaile called for, and not knowing as
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:14347:33"/>
yet againſt who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to wage it, fell in contention among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues on the matter: contrary to the liking of <hi>Sucuſano,</hi> who reputed <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> one of the moſt ſignall Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Knights, that euer ſearched after aduentures. After his <hi>Perſians</hi> had long importuned him, he gaue them licence for the fight, and the firſt that came forth was a Gyant, diſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the progenie of <hi>Darmaque,</hi> who was ſlaine by <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merin d' Oliua,</hi> for which, hauing mortall hatred againſt all Chriſtians, he declared his diſcontented moode, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his ſigne for the Iouſt, without ſpeaking one word, he procéeded to encounter him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alfiero,</hi> for ſo was hee named, beeing a hardie man at armes, wounded <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> vppon the ſhoulder, bearing away with his Launce the péece of Armour that couered it, but the Chriſtian piercing him thorow the ſhielde, paſſed on through his arme, bearing both horſe &amp; man to the ground, when eaſily he might haue ſlaine him before he could gette from vnder his horſe: but vſing knightly curteſie, he ſtayd his leyſure till he could ariſe. The Giant, who neuer knew what curteſie meant: imagined, that this fauour procéeded from his enemies ſlender ſkill in chiualrie, whereupon hée ſaid: Fooliſh Knight, ſéeing thy wit ſerued thee not, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome me when I could not defend my ſelfe: Ile teach thee better iudgement by the temper of this ſword.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> returning no aunſwere, diſmounted from his horſe, and aduauncing his weapon, began to hacke and hew <hi>Alfiero:</hi> which ſtrokes were ſo well replyed vnto, as both of them were very ſore wounded. Mary <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> beſtird himſelfe about ſo nimbly, as his hurts ſeemed but little to offend him: and now he began to beate his enemie round about the field, euen at his owne pleaſure, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers great diſaduantage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alfieros</hi> two Brethren, no leſſe couragious then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ſéeing their brother grow into ſuch extreame weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, hauing purpoſely hid themſelues in a wood néere hand, ſuddenly ruſhed forth together vpon <hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> who fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himſelfe much wearied, and béeing now ſo ouer-mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
<pb facs="tcp:14347:34"/>
could not defend himſelfe againſt theſe thrée, but they buckling round about him, tooke him priſoner. For which <hi>Targiana</hi> was at deaths doore, yet the other foure Knights renued her comfort: albeit they greatly reprooued them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, becauſe they were not as then armed in the fielde, truſting but ſhallowly the Pagans faithfulneſſe. <hi>Sucu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſano</hi> feyned, that this Knights impriſonment, rather diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed him, then otherwiſe, and would not that he ſhoulde be ledde to his Tent: yet made he no other ſhew, of ſetting him at libertie againe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dorina,</hi> when ſhe beheld matters fall from ill to worſe, repented that ſhe had not brought <hi>Palmerin</hi> and <hi>Florendos</hi> with her: but that nothing might want which ſhee was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to performe, ſhe would perſonally goe to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and thence bring with her the moſt famous Knights, that <hi>Florian</hi> might not die, whoſe griefe was incomparable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee coulde not heare what was become of <hi>Targiana.</hi> And <hi>Sucuſano</hi> many times would haue ſlaine him, not ſo much for reuenge of his Brothers death, as vtterly depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <hi>Targiana</hi> of all hope, to enioy him as her huſband, were he ſo or not: or if ſhee were not married to him, then her minde might alter, and chuſe him for her huſband. But ſtill herein his Counſell diſwaded him, ſaying: That when neuer ſo many Pagan Lords preuailed by their powerfull Armies, euermore the moſt valiant of the Chriſtians were permitted to liue: as not to incite thoſe ſpirits forward, that before were animated to purſue reuenge.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding, he might cauſe it to be noyſed abroad, that <hi>Florian</hi> ſhould bee beheaded, and placing a Scaffolde neere the Cittie, engirt it rounde with his owne Caual<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb facs="tcp:14347:35"/>The Knights, béeing very penſiue at theſe newes, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med themſelues in all haſt, and without taking leaue of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie other but <hi>Aliart,</hi> with a ſhip are ſayling toward <hi>Turkie.</hi> This their ſudden departure, not a little moued the other Princes, and deſirous to know the cauſe, they importuned <hi>Aliart</hi>: who as yet would not let them goe, for although theyr wounds were thorowly healed, yet were they weake and feeble: but béeing vnable to contayne, ſuch was his feare of <hi>Florian,</hi> hee told the whole diſcourſe, whereon the Knights prepared themſelues preſently.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Platir, Berolde,</hi> &amp; <hi>Gracian,</hi> were in ſuch haſt to be gone, to be there in time for helpe of their friend, that deſiring no more company, (for they thought it a ſhame to goe ſo many together) they ſet on toward the place where <hi>Aliart</hi> had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed them. <hi>Blandidon</hi> very angry that they woulde not ſtay for him, was faine to goe alone, and ſo did <hi>Francian</hi> likewiſe: but leaue we them to their iourney, and ſpeak of ſome matters doone in the <hi>Perilous Ile.</hi>

                  <hi>Aliart,</hi> who tooke care to maintaine the familie of <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merin,</hi> cauſed the chyldren of theſe Princes to bee brought vp very induſtriouſly: that when occaſion ſerued, it ſhould appeare they were well gouerned, wiſe, &amp; apt to armes.

               <p>The like ſtrife was in <hi>Leonato</hi> and <hi>Tarnaes,</hi> by reaſon they both delighted in <hi>Candida,</hi> daughter to <hi>Belizart,</hi> whoſe very name obſcured euery one, that ſought to be famous by beautie. For theſe reaſons <hi>Aliart</hi> was deſieous to ſeperate

them, but he could not ſend the one away, except he did the like to the other: therefore (though againſt their wils) they abode there together: and he likewiſe deſired as yet to kéep them there, till matters were better eſtabliſhed in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome, for <hi>Fraunce, Spayne, Almayne,</hi> and moſt of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kingdomes (hauing loſt their Princes) were ſubiected to mutinous ſeditions, whence great ruine was likelieſt to enſue: beſide, hee was the more willing to ſtay them ſtill there, that they might not ſéeke after their order of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode, vntill they were growne in yeares more ſtrong and able.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oliuanto,</hi> brother to <hi>Primaleon,</hi> beeing yet very young, gaue aſſured teſtimony that he would become valiant: but <hi>Leonato,</hi> ſonne to <hi>Palmerin</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> ſhewed himſelfe ſo forward to chiualrie, &amp; was ſo like in countenance to great <hi>Palmerin</hi> his father, as wonderfull matter was expected of him, becauſe he gaue himſelfe to ſo braue diſpoſition. <hi>Caro,</hi> ſonne to <hi>Gracian,</hi> kept in ſecret by his Nurſe, was conuay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thence into <hi>

               <p>The people being aduertiſed of their Lords returne, came vppon the bridge with ſuch ſportes and feaſting, as neuer was the like ſéene in <hi>Constantinople</hi> before, for <hi>Brundo</hi> the Gouernour ſuffered nothing wanting, that might any way ſerue to honour him withall.

               <p>The Emperours walke continued from morning till night, not able to ſatiſ-fie himſelfe, ſeeing each ruined place newly reedified: ſo that now hee might ſpend his time in ioy, but for the paine of his arme. Yet the death of ſo manie Princes was greeuous to him, to whoſe children therefore he confeſt himſelfe the more indebted: chiefely to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of <hi>Almaigne,</hi> who died, both hee and <hi>Polinard</hi> his brother. Wherefore, by ſending his Embaſſadors into that Kingdome, there came to his Court <hi>Bazilia</hi> very aged, and with her a ſonne of <hi>Polinards,</hi> named <hi>Trineus,</hi> which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got on a Lady of that Country, whom he tooke to wife onely for her beautie.</p>
               <p>The Emperour was excéeding ioyfull to beholde the young Prince, who was about the age of thirteene yéeres, apt and towardly to receiue his charge of the Empire. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſolemne welcomes vſed to his ſiſter, and the Princes that were come to the coronation of their Emperour: hee cauſed young <hi>Trineus</hi> to ſitte downe in a chayre of eſtate by him, and with all royall pompe to bee annoynted Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour: then ſetting the Crowne on his head, in magnificent ſtate hee rode with him thorough the Cittie, to the end hee might the better be knowne, and more publiquelie honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p>All the ceremonies beeing accompliſhed, hée gaue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the hearing of weightie cauſes, ſuch as <hi>Brundo</hi> wanted authoritie to perfect: for hée beeing but a Lieuete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, would not put his hand to euery buſineſſe, but reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

                  <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Vcuſano,</hi> according as hee had béene councelled, commaunded, that fifty thouſand horſemen (rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die prepared for fight, ſhould cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle the Scaffold: where each of them verily beléeued, that iuſtice was to bée performed on Prince <hi>Florian,</hi> and the very ſame opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was conceited in the Cittie. With much adoe the pryſoner was brought thether, and the Chriſtian Knights (full of gréefe) armed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to goe to death with him, for nowe they were voyd of all hope to free him. <hi>Targiana,</hi> becauſe <hi>Dorina</hi> was gone to <hi>Constantinople</hi> for ayde, ſeeing ſhee now ſhoulde remaine alone in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtell, began to be diſmaied: and though her fréendes labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to comfort her, yet would ſhee not remaine as a pray to her enemie, but prouiding herſelfe with Armour accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, would needes beare them companie, conſidering, that ſéeing ſhe muſt needs die, ſhee could neuer haue better occaſion, then to ſpende her life in giuing helpe to her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. So ſhe with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> foure Knights mounted on horſeback, hauing about a thouſand Turkes with them: who percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that their Princeſſe went to this diſmall ſtratageme, were the more willing to beare her companie. Great was the rumour amongſt the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and the crowde ſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull, as hardly could they bring their diſſembled priſoner to the Scaffold: but <hi>Targiana</hi> and her traine ſhouldering in among them, got into the way where they muſt paſſe with the priſoner.</p>

                  <hi>Dirdan</hi> fearing they would ouer-ſoone attaine the Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold with his friend, made ſuch ſpéede forward, &amp; outſtript his company ſo farre, that he was knowne by the <hi>Perſians,</hi> who fiercely aſſailing him, ſlew his horſe vnder him, and at length (after he had ſlaine about fiftie of them,) he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken priſoner. They neuer minding to carry him before <hi>Sucuſano,</hi> but taking him by his Armour to bee a Pagan, that was a fauourer of the Chriſtians, led him along with the other to behead him. <hi>Pompides, Dragonalte, Floraman,</hi> and <hi>Targiana</hi> with the reſt, hauing loſt the ſight of <hi>Dirdan,</hi> and hearing the meruailous noyſe among the Souldiers, imagined what was to true: then ſtriuing to get onward, the preaſſe was ſo innumerable, they could make no way, but ſtill were driuen back by ſuch a ſhock of people, as they knewe not well how to ſtirre themſelues.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dragonalte,</hi> béeing gotten hand to hand with a Giant, brother to <hi>Alfiero,</hi> that had taken <hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> ſo ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the companie, that beeing alone with him, hee founde ſmall curteſie at the Giants hands, who béeing aſſiſted by many of his followers, tooke him likewiſe, and led him on with the other priſoners to the Scaffold. <hi>Floraman, Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pides,</hi> and <hi>Targiana,</hi> carying themſelues very valiantly, did very much with their weapons, but to ſmall auaile: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were ſo hemd in with enemies, as they coulde not hope to get forth aliue. Wherefore, procéeding on ſo farre as they could, <hi>Targiana,</hi> who laboured to attaine the place, where ſhée imagined her <hi>Florian</hi> to be, pricked ſtill forward, but béeing kept backe by the <hi>Perſians,</hi> that kept the priſoners in a round, after ſhée had defended herſelfe ſo wel as ſhe could, (hauing on an enchaunted Armour, that ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time belonged to her great Graundfather) ſhee was taken vnwounded, and led bounde to ſuffer death with the other priſoners, becauſe ſhee was not knowne, and ſhee herſelfe, perceiuing this was no place to make her ſelfe knowne, kept ſilence, leaſt ſhe ſhould be further tormented.</p>
               <p>Theſe affaires falling out thus vnfortunately, it came to paſſe, that (the night before) <hi>Palmerin</hi> and <hi>Florendos,</hi>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:14347:37"/>
were arriued at the Caſtel of <hi>Albayzo,</hi> which was held by the Chriſtians, (as is declared in the booke of <hi>Primaleon</hi>) and that it was conquered by <hi>Polendos.</hi> Heere they were giuen to vnderſtand, that the next morning, Prince <hi>Florian</hi> ſhould looſe his head: it was no need to bidde them ride all night, and ſuch ſpéede they made, that (by the ninth howre the next day) they reached the <hi>Perſian</hi> Campe. When they heard ſuch a mighty noyſe as was made, they thought the Chriſtian to be dead, or in extreame perrill, wherfore put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſpur too luſtily, they hapned on that ſide, where <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pides</hi> &amp; <hi>Floraman,</hi> with about thrée hundred Turkes, were ſtrongly borne backe. Then running into the crowde with full carrire, not hiding their ſignall at Armes, they began ſo to lay about them, that the <hi>Perſians</hi> amazed, to ſee a man ſliced through the midſt, and ſome-time both horſe and man hewen thorow at a blow: beganne to make way for them. Beſide, when ſome noted the Armes imperiall, and others the badge of the Serpent, both which they feared ſo much in the war at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> gladlie they with-drew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</p>
               <p>So got theſe two Knights into company of <hi>Pompides</hi> and <hi>Floraman,</hi> who reckoning the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but in ſtate of dead men, onely ſought to ſell their liues ſo deerely as they could: and béeing both on foote, <hi>Palmerin</hi> (knowing <hi>Pompides</hi> by his <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Armes) cryed to him: Feare not Knight, for héere is <hi>Palmerin</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> Then killing a Giant that ſtoode contending with him for the maiſterie, he tooke the Giants horſe, and gaue it to <hi>Pompides:</hi> who becauſe hée would be no longer troden among the people, mounted thereon quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Florendos,</hi> ſided his friend <hi>Floraman,</hi> &amp; dealt his almes ſo bountifully about him, that he had ſoone got him on horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe to. Thus theſe foure Knights kept theyr owne ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron, defending their Turkiſh aſſiſtants, who were verie wearie, and but fewe in number: yet ſeeing what valiant Captaines fought for them, they ſtoode to it manfully eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14347:38"/>A <hi>Perſian</hi> that knew <hi>Palmerin</hi> and <hi>Florendos</hi> by theyr Armes, went preſently to acquaint <hi>Sucuſano</hi> there-with, who imagining the game were abſolutely wonne, if hée could be poſſeſſed of theſe two Knights, beſide, that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the <hi>Grecian</hi> Empire were conquered, but all <hi>Turkie</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe aſſuredly his owne: co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded all his whole power foorthwith in a readines, determining ſo to encloſe them with Armed men, as they ſhoulde compaſſe no meanes to eſcape.</p>
               <p>So buſily was euery one arming himſelfe, as <hi>Dramu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiande</hi> was quite forgotten, who beeing ſhut vp in a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in the Tent, had bound vp his woundes and recouered good ſtrength. Hee ſéeing each one ſo earneſtly imployed, and that little or no care at all was had of him, couering himſelfe with a <hi>Perſian</hi> cloake, as if hee meant to lay him downe and ſléepe: watched opportunitie, when ſtealing foorth, hée went along lymping like a wounded <hi>Perſian,</hi> holding downe his head on his hand, as hiding a hurt, and béeing thus gotten foorth of the Campe, made haſt toward the Citty, where making himſelfe knowne, he was let in, there compaſſing the meanes to Arme himſelfe anew.</p>
               <p>All this while the priſoners were in leading forward, and now they had attained neere the Scaffold, when ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly a Turkiſh Knight, one of them that went forth with <hi>Targiana,</hi> returned to the Cittie, bringing newes that the Princeſſe was taken, and ſhould be beheaded. At theſe ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, all the people aroſe, and arming themſelues imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly, went and ioyned with tenne thouſand Souldiours, which came vnder the conduct of the before named Lord of <hi>Antioche.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> not a little gladde of this ſupply, led the way out of the Citty, hauing thirty hundred horſe in his companie, and ſo ſoone as he reached the <hi>Perſian</hi> power, hée made toward the Scaffold ſo neere as he could, bearing a Mace, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſometime belonged to <hi>Alfiero,</hi> which hee brought with him foorth of the enemies Campe, becauſe it was ſtrong, and well knotted.

               <p>
                  <hi>Palmerin, Florendos,</hi> and the other twaine, being ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly fighting on the contrary wing, knew nothing of this ſtirre, by reaſon whereof they had greatly béene endange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: but that the <hi>Perſians</hi> (ſore weakened by their mightie ſtrokes) ſhunned ſo much as they could, from dealing with them at the ſwords poynt any longer, but ſent Launces, darts, and arrowes to them very thick from a farre off, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no other helpe left to defend their owne liues.</p>
               <p>By this time was there arriued from the Sea, <hi>Platir, Berolde,</hi> and <hi>Gratian,</hi> who hauing met a footman wounded to the death, heard, that this battaile was in reſcue of a Knight, in danger to be executed, his name béeing <hi>Florian:</hi> and three other (thruſting themſelues in for his defence) were likewiſe in the fight taken priſoners.</p>
               <p>Theſe Knights, ſeeing the Armie (in a manner) num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſſe, not able in ten dayes ſpace to be diſcomfited, when likewiſe they beheld mountaines of ſlaughtered men, they thought it impoſſible to recouer <hi>Florian:</hi> yet not to fayle one iote in Knightly dutie, they ſet vpon the Campe, euen where they imagined the ſkirmiſh to be hotteſt, &amp; that was where <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> was circled in with the enemie, yet chéerefully fighting to encourage his followers.

                  <hi>Florendos</hi> and the reſt ſéeing him on the Scaffold, made ſuch haſt to helpe him, as beating downe euery one that

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter <hi>Sucuſano</hi> beheld, that on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery ſide ſo many Chriſtians were entred the fielde, and theyr certaine number coulde not be diſcerned, by the confuſion they made amongſt themſelues, hée purpoſed a preſent returne into <hi>Perſia:</hi> for ſéeing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt famous Princes of Chriſtendome were ſo ſoone arriued there, hee feared that in ſhort time no meane ſtrength would be ſent them, and ſo their Armie might growe to an infinite multitude. But that which moſt of all diſmaied him, was the ſhallow diſpoſition he found in his Knights, who though they had doone good ſeruice in the late warre at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> yet nowe they wexed hartleſſe or voyde of all ſpirite, by verie beholding the Knights of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Court, whoſe behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our was as an vnrecouerable daunting to them all.

               <p>The morning enſuing, the Chriſtian Caualierie armed themſelues, to try what they could doe for the freedome of <hi>Florian,</hi> and drawing neere the Tents, where they coulde neither ſee man nor heare any noyſe: vppon theyr further entrance into the fielde Trenches, they perceiued that the <hi>Perſians</hi> were fled, and had carried away the Prince <hi>Flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> with them. This miſhap was ſo diſpleaſing to all thoſe

generous ſpirits, as it made them to excéede in vehement impacience: eſpecially <hi>Palmerin,</hi> who could reſtraine his rage within no boundes or limits, becauſe he had ſo negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently loſt his noble brother.

               <p>So ſetting forward with good prouiſion of victuals, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was a very deſert Country, they were faine to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture by ſuch dangerous paſſages, as they were much troubled with defending themſelues from manie wilde beaſtes: but the Captaines and Leaders being careful and diligent, made ſlaughter of diuers, and guarded all in ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Palmerin,</hi> who would needes ſtray further from the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie then any of the reſt, to track more narrowly the footing of <hi>Sucuſano,</hi> was aſſailed by two very furious Lyons: that ſlewe his horſe vnder him, and by reaſon of his foote hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faſt in the ſtirrop, had likewiſe ſlaine him, but that <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir</hi> &amp; <hi>Blandidon</hi> came in good time, for one Lyon had grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled him by the ſhoulder, and very eaſily had dragd him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, but that by the woundes theſe Knights gaue them both, they were diſappointed, and made ſuch loude out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryes on their hurts, that their cry called thether two Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Platir</hi> wounded deadly the Lyon that had faſtned on <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merin,</hi> and cutting off one of his leggs, made him fal downe
<pb facs="tcp:14347:41"/>
along vpon the earth. <hi>Blandidon</hi> cut the other Lyon quite thorow the reynes of the back, which made the beaſt med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle no more with <hi>Palmerin,</hi> but turne to reuenge that hurt on him which gaue it: ſo cloſing with <hi>Blandidon,</hi> the Lyon had intreated him very curſtly, but that he plyed his hande with his ſhort ſword, and pierced ſo farre into his entrailes, as the beaſt tumbled backward ouer and ouer.</p>
               <p>In this time had <hi>Palmerin</hi> freed his foote out of the ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rop, and it hapned well that he did recouer himſelfe ſo ſoone, becauſe of the two other Lyons, that were come at the cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of them now ſlaine, and a ſhée Beare beſide, the very fierceſt that was in all that deſert Forreſt, and hauing but little before béene robbed of her whelpes, made her to be much more violent and furious. The Lyons ranne, the one at <hi>Palmerin,</hi> the other at <hi>Platir,</hi> and the beaſts finding them as yet not to be crowned (for they neither can nor will of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend any of royal progenie) aſſayled them ſomewhat ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie. The ſhée Beare onely dealt with <hi>Blandidon</hi>: but hee ordered her in ſuch ſort, as there hee made her to leaue her life, where-vppon there came running at him two other huge Beares, and they had well néere layde him along on ground, but that <hi>Florendos</hi> (enuying that theſe Knights ſhould ſéeke glory alone by themſelues, in a place where ſtrange aduentures were to be found) hauing committed the Armies care to <hi>Floraman,</hi> ſpurred amaine thether, bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing followed likewiſe by <hi>Dramuſiande, Gracian,</hi> &amp; <hi>Berolde. Pompides, Dirdan,</hi> &amp; <hi>Dragonalte,</hi> could not ſo readilie haſt along with them, by reaſon of the wounds they receiued in the laſt battaile, whereof as yet they were not thorowlie recouered.</p>
               <p>Theſe Knights came and ioyned with the other, euen as they were ſo hardly beſet by the Lyons and the Beares, ſo that the iſſue of this encounter might very well be doubted. The Lyons (according to theyr nature) were excéeding fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and the Knights béeing diſmounted, ſpared not to let them feele the goodnes of theyr weapons: but <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> perceiuing <hi>Blandidon</hi> in very great perrill, went to helpe
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:14347:41"/>
him, and gaue the Beare ſuch a wound vpon the head, as part of it fell there-with to the ground: yet for all this the beaſt made hard at him, and got him by the boſome, griping hard his right hand with his rude pawes, and but that the Beare was much weakened by his former hurt, hee had béene brought into very hard diſtreſſe, wherefore the other Knights beholding the neceſſity, &amp; that <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> was ſo narrowlie beſted, came to reſcue him, euen as <hi>Dramuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ande</hi> hauing got his ſword into his left hand, made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the beaſts right pawe fall to the earth. And ſo the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant being now out of danger, went once more to giue ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour to <hi>Blandidon,</hi> who was mightily diſaduantaged by the other Beare: and running mainly at him with a ful thruſt, the ſword paſſed quite thorow him, and the beaſt tumbled ouer dead to the ground.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Palmerin,</hi> who had now vnbuckled his Cuiraſſe, founde himſelfe ſore wounded in the left flanck: but an vndaunted minde béeing his onely ſupporter, he drew his hand-kircher through the beaſtes belly, and clapping it to the hurt, ſo bound it vp as an eſpeciall medicine. <hi>Florendos,</hi> who in enuie was come to this bickering, had almoſt founde the iuſt puniſhment to ſuch a ſin: for one of the Lyons caught hold on his Creaſt behinde, and threw him ſo violentlie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ground, as the Helmet flew off his head, and had not <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> ſtept to him in time, his life had béen diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patcht for euer. But he ſmiting the Lyon vpon the buttock, made him paſt abilitie of further going, and lying ſpraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling along in raging manner, he roared ſo extreamely, as the cry brought thether aboue an hundred Lyons, Wolues and Beares: and they had very ſpéedily deuoured theſe Princes, but that by hap the Armie was neere at hande, where beholding an occaſion offered of ſuch deſert, they ſlew moſt part of the beaſts, and the reſt fled: notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, <hi>Blandidon, Palmerin,</hi> and <hi>Berolde,</hi> were ſo hurte in theyr firſt encounters, as for certaine dayes they continued in weake diſpoſition. <hi>Mirante</hi> went ſtill before the Armie, and now began to get intelligence of the <hi>Perſian</hi> forces, ſo
<pb facs="tcp:14347:42"/>
that determining vppon more ſpeedie iourneyes, within eight dayes they could eaſily diſcerne them from a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, which ſeruing as a ſafe Sanctuarie to the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, allowed them nowe ſome reſt after ſo teadious la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
               <p>Soone after, <hi>Floraman</hi> who had béene created Captaine of the whole power, gaue order for entrance into a Woode neere adioyning, where quietly repoſing themſelues till <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>So pacing on very ſilently, about midnight they came cloſe to the Armie: which ſtoode vpon ſmall guarde or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, becauſe they were voyde of all ſuſpition. Our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Knights woulde not aſſaile the weaker forces, but made way for themſelues to the Tent of <hi>Sucuſano,</hi> where then giuing out the voyce of battaile, they gaue a valiant aſſault, &amp; ſlew at the firſt cloſing aboue ten thouſand <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> But becauſe <hi>Sucuſano</hi> had before giuen order, that fiue and twentie thouſand ſhould attend euery night the guarde of his owne perſon, and thoſe now, though very ſléepie, had their bodies vnarmed, and their horſes not ſadled: yet ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly put themſelues into ſo good ſort, as they reſiſted the Chriſtian power very reſolutely, and among them was the Giant <hi>Alfiero</hi> with his two Brethren, and they beſtird themſelues with no meane furie: for, hauing Maces of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable weight &amp; greatnes, they made hauocke enough of all that durſt come neere them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> hearing the report of theſe Giants, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined it was they that before had taken him: wherefore, ruſhing through the preaſe, he encountered <hi>Alfiero</hi> face to face, ſaying: Behold how Fortune hath once more made vs meete, becauſe at my handes thou ſhouldſt receaue thy death. <hi>Alfiero,</hi> who had ſoundly felt his blowes before, could gladly haue béene rid of him: notwithſtanding, as it was
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:14347:42"/>
now no time for cowardly frights or feares, ſo he gaue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward boldly to buckle with him, and there they two were at it alone by themſelues.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> whoſe onely deſire was Prince <hi>Florians</hi> fréedome, fought with ſuch furie and earneſtnes together, as within a ſmall while <hi>Alfiero</hi> was brought into ſuch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, that falling downe ouer-laboured among the horſe féete, there the huge Giant was troden to death. The <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> did what they could to reſiſt this hote aſſault, but what with the ſuddennes, &amp; frighted amazement, neither could they arme one part of their people, nor endure in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grée againſt the Chriſtians. And (which moſt diſmayed them) <hi>Sucuſano,</hi> who ſuppoſed ſo ſlender a ſtrength of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, durſt not thus ſo haue perſued and aſſailed him: could now determine on nothing but flight, ſo cauſing <hi>Flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> forthwith to bee horſed, with about two thouſand of his truſtieſt followers, away both he and they fledde toward a Caſtell.</p>
               <p>This was not doone with ſuch cunning or ſecrecie, but it was diſcerned by his owne Souldiers: who falling into the like affright as their Lord before had doone, and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the number of their foes to be more then they coulde poſſibly withſtand, began likewiſe to leaue the field, and ſo the Chriſtians remained victors.</p>
               <p>But when they came to <hi>Sucuſanos</hi> Pauillion, &amp; founde that hee was eſcaped and gone: they grew very deſperate, and fearing leaſt they ſhould looſe his track, purſued imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly with all poſſible ſpéede. But to no purpoſe had thys labour ſorted, had not <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> (by good hap) light on a Dwarffe by the way falne into a Ditch, whom hee help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, and taking vp before him on his ſaddle bowe, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by him whether <hi>Sucuſano</hi> was fled. Hee aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <hi>Floraman</hi> and the reſt heereof, without taking any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion, or great part of the Campe with them, they ſpurrd ſpeedily after, and came thether at the inſtant, when <hi>Sucu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſano</hi> was comming foorth of the Caſtell, with intent to poſt toward <hi>Perſia</hi> preſently.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14347:43"/>But ſéeing his enemies thus come vpon him, hee retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in againe, where nowe hee meant to make himſelfe ſtrong, and ſend for freſh ſupply to be his deliuerance. But by reaſon of the Countries barrennes, not affording victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all or other prouiſion: they grew to articles of agréement, which were, that <hi>Florian</hi> ſhould be rendered ſafe &amp; ſound, and he paſſe without moleſtation into <hi>Perſia,</hi> vpon promiſe, neuer to mooue more warre againſt the Chriſtians, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the royall Lady <hi>Targiana.</hi> Thus was Prince <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> deliuered, and <hi>Sucuſano</hi> departed thence, after hee had aſſembled his ſcattered forces together.</p>

within an howre or little more, <hi>Dorina</hi> put in her Barque to Land, and ſtepping foorth on ſhoare, went vp directlie to the Pallace: where was <hi>Aliart,</hi> and all the other young Princes, who beholding her there arriued in ſuch ſort, troopt together to vnderſtand of whence ſhe was.</p>
               <p>The Lady falling on her knee before <hi>Aliart,</hi> ſpake in this maner. Mighty &amp; moſt diſcreet Lord, once more am I come hether with my Monſter, to try if I can conclude an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe of mine: but nowe I partly repent my comming he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe (turning and looking about her) I ſée none heere likely to conquer the Monſter, for he that could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it, is to goe with me to a greater and much more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable aduenture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aliart,</hi> who was not now accompanied with any Knights likely to vntertake a matter of ſuch moment, thus aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Good Lady, the aduenture of your Monſter could not haue failed héere, when we had ſuch Knights as your ſelfe haue made proofe of: but nowe you come at a very vnapt time, for heere are none now but youthes onely, and ſuch as yet haue neuer beene knighted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dorina,</hi> interrupting <hi>Aliarts</hi> aunſwere, ſaid: My Lord, I am not come hether by chaunce, but directed by a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment deſire, which I haue to make famous this gallant Infantrie, whom Fortune may fauour with vanquiſhing the Monſter. And albeit they are not knighted as yet, that may very eaſily be prouided for: let them but be had to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where the Emperour is readie to knight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny woorthy deſeruer, and there they may be ready for all good haps whatſoeuer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aliart,</hi> who could not wel gaine-ſay her reaſonable ſpée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, (for all the young Lordes longed to bee exerciſing armes, &amp; wearied with practizing vſuall feates of defence, began to murmure that they were thus long hindered) and hoping the beſt of theyr towardly forwardnes, forth-with commaunded a ſhip to be made in readines, and ſending all the young Princes aboard, with prouiſion conuenient for ſuch a voyage, vnder the conduct of <hi>Argentao,</hi> and with li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:14347:44"/>
of their mothers, though loath to leaue them, they were thence diſmiſſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dorina</hi> who woulde not goe to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> dealt ſo ſubtilly, as ſhe made her Monſter to appeare, euen as <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maleon</hi> the ſecond was ready to ſtep into the ſhyp: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of hee béeing deſirous to haue a further ſight, without anie longer tarrying, leapt into the Barque, which ſuddenlie was ſeene to put off from the ſhoare, and got more then halfe a leagues diſtance, ere they coulde ſee what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of <hi>Primaleon,</hi> and afterward it ſayled ſo ſwiftlie, that quickly had they loſt the ſight of it altogether. The Shyp with the young Lords, made on for <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and in meete place ſhall be ſhewen what after became of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dorina</hi> was not a little gladde ſhee had got this young Prince, made him promiſe of horſe and Armour, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he ſhould vndertake an aduenture: which although it would prooue dangerous, yet he ſhould accompliſh it, and attaine to as great glorie and renowne, as euer had the Emperour <hi>Primaleon, Don Edward,</hi> or <hi>Florendos</hi> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Primaleon,</hi> who had mind on nothing elſe but horſe, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and knighthood, made liberall promiſe of his lyfes hazard in any attempt what ſoeuer, as thinking it a death moſt glorious, to be afterward eternized famous. So ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on, the Barque at length put in at an Iland, which ſeemed rather a receptacle for wilde beaſtes, then any ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation for ciuill people: there hee (forſaking the Barque) ſtepping foorth on Land, walked a little along by himſelfe, and hauing not béene accuſtomed to ſuch accidents, the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couthnes of the place ſome-what diſmaied him. But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, making better remembrance of himſelfe, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring alſo what <hi>Dorina</hi> had ſayd vnto him, &amp; doubting leaſt ſhée ſhould diſcerne any deiected ſpirit in him, hee entred a wood neere adioyning, and not farre had hee paced along therein, but hee had a glimpſe of bright Armour hanging there on a high trée, and beeing not a little glad that hée had found what he ſought for, he hied him to the place, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming
<pb facs="tcp:14347:45"/>
ſo neere to it, that hee might eaſily take it downe with his hand, which as hee made offer to doe, intending to arme himſelfe therewith, hee felt a forcible ſtrength to reſtraine him from it, whereat meruayling in his minde, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what offended that hee could not arme himſelfe ſo ſoone as he would haue done, he made a more violent proffer, when ſuddenly hee hearde a voyce from the trée, ſaying: Fond youth, ſince thou though<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Primaleon,</hi> who thought there was no occaſion ſo perri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, but by his courage hee ſhoulde out-goe it: tooke his oath immediatly, and proteſting the ſame with ſtrict aſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerations, to ſée what further might thereon enſue, hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the Armour to be taken from the trée, and the tree to extend it ſelfe into ſuch largenes, as by little and little it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it ſelfe into a goodly Pallace, after the ſhape &amp; reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of a Theater. In the midſt whereof appeared a ſeat royall, and thereon ſate a Quéene very maieſtically, with fayre goodly treſſes of haire before, but all bald behind: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward ſhee tooke a wheele vnto her, whereon there ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be many men and women, who changed from place to place as often as the wheele turned about. There were alwayes ſome, (though very fewe) entreated as fauorites, that ſtoode neere the footeſteps of the ſtate, and other ſo neere, as they might eaſily touch it: but at no time durſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny make offer of dooing it, nor hold they this happines for any long continuaunce, but euer as they grew proude of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:14347:45"/>The place was figured foorth in very liuely cullers, where might be diſcerned the foure Monarchies in theyr firſt flower and beautie, afterward, how the three (alreadie ruined and deſtroyed) fell into their ouerthrow, and the fourth (to wit, the Romaine) toſſed vp and downe by the whéeles turnings, now aloft, then as lowe, was yet ſtill in the warie eye of Fortune.</p>
               <p>There were infinite Kings and Princes together on a heape, ſtriuing and contending for her fauouring counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce: but all their labor was in vaine, for the more they ſtroue, the leſſe ſhe reſpected them.</p>
               <p>The young Prince <hi>Primaleon,</hi> who had care of nothing elſe but how to compaſſe the Armour, made no regarde of all theſe apparitions, but preſſing on a little more, hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>helde Fortune to diſcend from her ſeate, and ſhewing him very kinde lookes, as to one whom ſhée eſpecially fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: by her owne hands he was armed Knight-like in all reſpects, with ſuch loude applauſe of all the other by-ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, as it appeared hee held no meane roome in her grace, which afterward altred into ſome ſhewes of enuie, becauſe he alone was regarded, and they helde as neglected, then thus ſhe ſpake to him.</p>
               <p>Henceforth be thou called <hi>Fortunes Knight,</hi> and verie aptly art thou ſo entiteled, becauſe thy deſires ſhall neuer aime at any thing: but for euery drop of ſweat thou ſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt therein, thou ſhalt haue infinites of fame and glorie, and my ſelfe alwaies to be thy ſoueraigne Patroneſſe. <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maleon,</hi> who onely thirſted after honour, as alſo to reach the height of his hope in loue, thought this (as well hee might) a bleſſing beyond all other to be thus armed, and fauoured by Fortune: then gaue ſhée him her forelockes to hold in her hand, as a ſigne, that by ſuch progreſſion was his likelieſt way of preuailing.</p>
               <p>So taking her ſeate againe, ſhe made a ſigne of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, when preſently all vaniſhed; the trée cloſed again, and the wood appeared as it had doone before: whereat hée meruailing not a little, ſaw a goodly horſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming toward

him, with a faire ſhielde faſtned at the ſaddle-bowe, the horſe gently co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to his hand, he mounted on his back, and looking on the ſhielde, hee behelde a Knight portrayed thereon, holding Fortune (in the habite of a beautifull wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) by the forelocks.</p>
               <p>So pleaſing was this deuiſe vnto him, as now he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to call himſelfe the <hi>Knight of Fortune</hi>: and looking ſomewhat lower vpon the ſheelde, he perceiued the face of a Lady, but couered with a vaile in ſuch manner, as hee could not apprehend the forme of her beautie, but there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared a hande as pointing to her, and vnder it was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten this motto, <hi>Proude beautie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus rode the Knight on, his minde ſtill hammering on loue, and deſire of glory, and then he eſpied <hi>Dorina</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming toward, who before had ſtoode inuiſible by, and ſhee cauſing him to goe on board againe, ſet ſayle immediatlie for <hi>Constantinople.</hi>

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:14347:46"/>
appeared certaine ſignes vnto them, which gaue notice of important matters to diuers of them. <hi>Leonato</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Palmerin</hi> beeing deuoutly at prayer, he beheld an aged Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour enter the Chappell, who laying his hand vpon his breaſt, ſaid. Behold, I take all feare from thee, that may be iniurious, or hurt thee in any perrillous enterpriſe, &amp; make thee <hi>Knight of the Sword</hi>: which deuiſe he bare while he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, atchiuing manifold honours thereby, and it was ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, that this old man was the ſhadow of the Emperour <hi>Palmerin d' Oliua.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe ſpéeches were plainly heard by diuers of the reſt, and others entring the Chappell, founde him both armed and girt with a Sword: which made them ſuppoſe, that hee ſhould neede no doubt of arming by the Emperour. To <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guto,</hi> who was at his deuotions in another place by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, appeared a King with a Shielde, which had figured in it a goodly Sunne, and taking him by the hand ſaid. I know that thy fortune, will heereafter cauſe thee to offende one, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou rather oughteſt to honour: but becauſe thou ſhalt not be the meaneſt in thoſe ſeruices which thou art to vndertake, I giue thée my ſhield of the Sunne, which ſhal be impenetrable, part therefore from hence, after thou haſt thy title of Knighthoode. No other hearde what this King had ſayde to <hi>Arguto,</hi> but ſawe howe hee armed him as a Knight.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Tarnaes</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Platir,</hi> came an old man in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſhort garments, who wanted one eye, and in breefe termes he ſpake thus to him. I giue thee this Armor, which once belonged to King <hi>Phillip</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> which ſhall make thee famous in all thine enterpriſes: and arming him therewith, preſently departed. Many that ſaw him at his departure, iudged him to be <hi>Lycurgus</hi> the Law-maker of <hi>Lacedemonia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the morning, the Emperour not a little wondering at theſe ſtrange accidents, gaue the other Knights theyr degrees: whereat <hi>Oliuanto,</hi> the ſecond ſonne of <hi>Florendos,</hi> was much diſcontented, becauſe the Emperour had not in
<pb facs="tcp:14347:47"/>
like manner knighted him, though indeed his young yéeres was his onely hinderance.</p>
               <p>The feaſting was very pompous, and the Emperour ſhewed himſelfe exceeding ioyfull, as beholding his Court now begin to flouriſh againe, which had béene before very ſad and ſolitarie, in regard of the mighty loſſes ſuſtained: and the caſe of Prince <hi>Florian</hi> cauſed ſome diſcontentment, albeit a little glimmering of good hap appeared, in that ſo many Knights was departed in queſt of him, and doubtleſſe would defend him from any perrill of life.</p>
               <p>The new created Knights, to giue ſome preſage of their hopefull valour, concluded a Tournament among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, at the Launce onely, and it was free for all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers what ſoeuer: onely it was in this manner ordained, becauſe if any Pagan Princes ſhould chaunce to be there, no treaſon or villainie could then be offered. The fame of this Iouſting flew through diuers parts of the world, yea, euen into Turkie, where the Chriſtian Knights were in great ioy and feaſting, for the happy deliuerance of the Prince <hi>Florian.</hi> And <hi>Targiana</hi> omitted no gracious kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe what ſoeuer, that might auaile for his delight or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment: ſo that the Turkes thought ſhee had made him her huſband, whereat they grewe ſad, and much diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, expecting euery howre when they ſhould be forced to deny their fayth, and be ſubiected to a Chriſtian Prince, the thought wherof to them was worſe then death. Very glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie would theſe Chriſtian Lordes be preſent at <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> as well to ſee the behauior of their Sonnes, as to make proofe of them by their owne experience: for at theſe yeres men ought endeuour to make themſelues glorious, and (in imitation of their Fathers) contend who ſhould be moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous.</p>
               <p>But they could not as yet get away from that Country, becauſe <hi>Riſtorano,</hi> hauing muſtered together many <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Knights, collected from diuers parts of the Prouinces, that came not in time for the ayde of <hi>Sucuſano</hi>: were repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be a very great Armie, and they were making ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilie
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:14347:47"/>
to <hi>Tubante,</hi> hauing foure crowned Kings in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, who were to be knowne by theſe deſcriptions. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rino</hi> King of <hi>Illium</hi> was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt, who had with him two huge Giants, and thirty thouſand armed Souldiours. <hi>Drago</hi> King of <hi>Memphis,</hi> the ſecond, who had a Monſter in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſhape, the very ſtrangeſt that euer was ſéene before. It went both on two feete, and likewiſe on foure, the heade like a Goate, with foure long bending hornes, two tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning toward the face, and two forward: with the firſt hée wounded when hee ſtoode on his two féete, and with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when he went vpon his foure. His armes were hairie briſtled, and more long then they that bore his bodie, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing nayles or talents ſo ſharpe &amp; piercing, as they woulde enter through any Shielde: in all the reſt hee reſembled a man, except his feete, and in ſtature greatly he excéeded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Giant whatſoeuer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vlderino</hi> King of <hi>Tanais</hi> was the third, a man very va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant of himſelfe, hauing twentie thouſand followers, and two Sonnes of a Giantlike ſtature. The fourth was <hi>Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendo,</hi> the moſt cruell King of <hi>Scithia,</hi> with fiftéene thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of his armed people: according as theyr cuſtome is to goe, onely with Launce and bow, mounted on horſebacke, but without any bridle.</p>
               <p>All theſe ioyned their forces with <hi>Riſtorano,</hi> who like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe had an hundred thouſand men, what with his <hi>Perſians</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Turkie,</hi> who marching diſordredly, cumbred much ground, and were greatly feared all the way they went: for now no other newes ranne any where abroade, but that their Princeſſe <hi>Targiana</hi> was married to <hi>Florian</hi> King of <hi>Thrace,</hi> and thereby they doubted ſubiection to the <hi>Grecian</hi> Empire, which was very yrkeſome to them but to heare.</p>
               <p>When the Chriſtian Knights heard what a power was comming againſt them, and that ſo many Kings had ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their ſtrength with <hi>Riſtorano,</hi> fearing leaſt theyr ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting this preſent occaſion in <hi>Turkie,</hi> might abridge them from euer beholding their owne Countries, they diſpatched

               <p>
                  <hi>Blandidon,</hi> perceiuing he was not farre from his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Niquea,</hi> promiſed to write thether, that ſo many ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med men ſhould be ſent him as they could make, and <hi>Dir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> the Graund Cane was vrged to the like, that he would alſo ſend to his kingdome of <hi>Paraz.</hi> But he that ſtoode ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſpoſed to make conqueſt of <hi>Niquea,</hi> and take to wife the beautifull Lady <hi>Tirrena,</hi> béeing thereto before ſollicited by ſundry inuitations: alleaged ſuch excuſes, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they were ſlenderly credited, yet none knew direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie how to obiect againſt them.</p>
               <p>The meſſengers from <hi>Blandidon</hi> béeing come to <hi>Nequea,</hi> there they vnderſtoode by diuers good friendes of his, howe matters ſtood already accorded co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning <hi>Tirrena</hi>: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, without deliuerance of their Embaſſage, they retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned backe againe, and certified the Chriſtian Lords of their ill ſucceſſe.

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:14347:48"/>
all, who remembring the dreame he had in the <hi>Perilous Ile,</hi> and telling the ſame to the Knights, they all founde it not fit to contend with ſo mighty a puiſſaunce, but to take the beſt courſe for the ſafetie of the Cittie, which not beeing ſo intirely furniſhed with prouiſion, they thought it beſt, day by day to deale by ſingle fights, vntill they had made ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uock of the Leaders and Captaines.</p>
               <p>In theſe hopes and determinations, they expected the enemies approch, who founde as they came but ſmall reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, by reaſon of the fault imputed to <hi>Targiana</hi>: and the Turkes were very deſirous and thirſty after newes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they heard that <hi>Targiana</hi> (with Prince <hi>Florian</hi>) was with-drawne into the Caſtell, and daily they endeuoured to fortifie <hi>Tubante.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Héereupon, <hi>Riſtorano</hi> béeing come within a league of the Citty, and there deuiſing on his beſt and apteſt meanes in procéeding, to beſiedge it was the generall concluſion. <hi>Palmerin,</hi> to giue a beginning to their former intention, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med himſelfe, and comming foorth of the Citty, ſtaying a place farre enough from the enemies Campe, gaue them to vnderſtand by an Heralde at Armes, after what manner they demaunded battaile.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Riſtorano,</hi> who was wiſe and prouident found very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily the purpoſe of the Chriſtians: and knowing that theſe were the flower of all the <hi>Grecian</hi> Caualierie, would not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grée vpon ſuch ſingle combate or fight, alleadging, that in regard they were but few, they had no other way more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for their owne defence. For, they coulde not expect any further aſſiſtance, becauſe the Empire of <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> was ſo emptied of her Souldiours in the late battaile, as thence could come no ſupply: and therefore it was meeteſt to engirt the Citty with ſtrong ſledge, which was the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way to vanquiſh without any damage.</p>
               <p>This indéede was the ſoundeſt counſell and aduiſe, but the Kings beeing youthfull and gallant, vnexperienced in the proofe of the Chriſtian warriours: would not allow of any thing but Combate, and becauſe they contended who
<pb facs="tcp:14347:49"/>
ſhould be formoſt, to conclude all further iarring, it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, that <hi>Carino,</hi> with one of his Gyants, <hi>Drago</hi> King of <hi>Memphis,</hi> and <hi>Stupendo</hi> King of <hi>Scithia,</hi> ſhoulde combate with any foure Knights of the Citty. This aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere was returned to <hi>Palmerin,</hi> that he and three other ſhould prepare themſelues, to deale in Combate the day following, neere to the Citty, and in meane while ſhoulde no wayes by them be iniured.</p>
               <p>Theſe newes were not a little welcome to the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, ſeeing theyr deſſeignment ſort to ſo good effect: heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon they made theyr preparation, and becauſe that all of them were willing to goe forth, they were commaunded to be in readines, according as afterward ſhould more aptlie be concluded vpon.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Palmerin,</hi> who already had accepted the Combate, (<hi>Floraman</hi> remaining ſtill as Captaine generall) <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos, Dramuſiande,</hi> and <hi>Berolde,</hi> were to be the other with him, whereat the Prince <hi>Florian</hi> was greatly offended: and this was a good helpe of preſeruing the Cittie from loſſe, as in the ſucceſſe heereof ſhal be declared. But leaue we them now in their former preparation, and returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine a while to <hi>Constantinople.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XXI. How they proceeded to the Tournament, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Arguto</hi> would haue ſlaine an vnknowne Knight, becauſe he could not endure his company.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Liart,</hi> who truſted not a little to his arte, ſent diuers of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall meſſengers, to vnderſtand by them how the affaires went in the enemies kingdome: and when he was reſolued, that there was no Armie prepared to come againſt the Chriſtians, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that of <hi>Riſtoranos,</hi> (who would much more willingly haue held his gouernment in quiet, then hazard it by medling with the Chriſtians, whom he verily imagined to be inuincible) he grew excéedingly deſirous, to ſend all the Princeſſes with their daughters into their owne iuriſdictions. And as they conferred héereon together, they concluded to goe for <hi>Constantinople,</hi> eſpecially ſuch as had loſt their huſbands: becauſe theyr ſad mindes would not admit them to ſée their natiue homes, where they were aſſured to find nothing but greefe and deſolation.</p>
               <p>This their determination diſpleaſed not <hi>Aliart,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cauſing a Ship to be very well prouided, they all went aboord, and himſelfe was the more willing to beare them company, becauſe no ſiniſter chaunce ſhould befall them by Sea: which vſually was wont to be perrillous by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the enemies forces béeing abroade, but nowe in bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter quiet by their late diſabling.</p>
               <p>Safely they ſayled along to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where the newes of their arriuall ranne quickly through the Cittie, and the Emperour co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunding the young Knights forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb facs="tcp:14347:50"/>
to Arme themſelues, accompanied with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Empreſſe <hi>Grydonia</hi> and <hi>Baſilia,</hi> went to giue welcome vnto the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
               <p>The Quéenes <hi>Palitia, Meliſſa, Francellina, Arnalte, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragarda,</hi> and <hi>Polynarda,</hi> were the firſt that went on Land, the three formoſt in their widdowed attires, but <hi>Arnalte</hi> more pompous and proude then euer before: there followed them <hi>Alderina, Leonida, Bramaciana, Deniſa, Sidelia, Oni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalda, Clariſsima, Bernarda, Clariana,</hi> and <hi>Florenda,</hi> who becauſe ſhee was high minded, would needes be the laſt, and went alone by herſelfe from all the reſt. Then follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed the younger Ladies in ſuch ſumptuous ornaments, as they drew all eyes to behold and admire them. <hi>Victoria,</hi> daughter to Prince <hi>Florian,</hi> becauſe ſhe was eldeſt, was admitted the priuiledge of landing firſt, ſeconded by <hi>Argen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina</hi> the <hi>Spanyard,</hi> ſo excelling in beauty, as it delighted all harts to behold her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Candida</hi> came next, whoſe perfections aunſwering her name, made her much wondred at. <hi>Spyna</hi> woulde haue gone with <hi>Florenda</hi> her mother, béeing of ſuch a haugtie proude diſpoſition, that though her ſinguler beautie made many to commend her, yet her coy diſdainfulnes, gaue iuſt cauſe of as great condemning her. Then followed <hi>Arlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cea,</hi> with her Sonne <hi>Franardo,</hi> that was left with her in the <hi>Perillous Ile,</hi> and <hi>Cardigea</hi> likewiſe with her Sonne <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maroll.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The newe created Knights led the young Ladies Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayes by the bridles, and the younger men the Palfrayes of the maried Princeſſes: whereat the Emperour laughed indifferently, and many pretty frumps and ieſts were bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken on the elder Ladies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arguto,</hi> whoſe expectation was at the Kingdome of <hi>Hungaria,</hi> as giuing place to no one in iuſtice of his title, preſented himſelfe forward, and taking <hi>Victoriaes</hi> Steede by the bridle, ſhewed her the greateſt kindneſſe hee coulde poſſibly vſe, with ſpéeches ſwéetly couched, and very effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall: but the young Lady, not acquainted with ſuch ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:14347:50"/>
nor vnderſtanding the youthful gallants purpoſe, by naturall curteſie returned him a very accomodate aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, which he entertayning as a good preſage of future happy fortune, thought him bleſſed in ſo faire a beginning. <hi>Oliuanto</hi> was the leader to <hi>Argentinaes</hi> Palfray: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was yet ouer-young, and not endued with knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, he did not behold her with the eye of affection. <hi>Tarnaes</hi> laying hand on <hi>Spynaes</hi> bridle, was welcomde ſo ſullenlie by her that knew no courſe of kindnes, as ſhe ſhewing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant ſignes of diſcontentment, and the young Lord blu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing at ſuch diſcourteous behauiour, ſtept backe againe, very much amated in his thoughts: &amp; this repulſe of hers béeing generally noted, raiſed a preſent imagination a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them all, that this ſcornefull pride, would keep <hi>Spy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> long enough without a huſband.</p>
               <p>When the Emperour <hi>Primaleon</hi> had well beheld the beautie of <hi>Candida,</hi> albeit hee was olde, hee could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, but needes he would goe and be the guide to her pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray: whereat the Princeſſes ſmyled a good among them ſelues, but his ſiſter <hi>Baſilia</hi> (to thwart their intended ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtings herevpon) called <hi>Arlencea,</hi> and giuing her roome to ride in the midſt of them, began to talke pleaſantly concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> and howe if hee had not departed with <hi>Doryna,</hi> what little hope remained of his longer life. So entred they the Cittie in very great tryumph, and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full preparation made by the inhabitants, vnable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale their ioy and contentment, hauing their Emperour ſo royally among them, and matters reduced into their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer dignitie.</p>
               <p>And in this manner they came to the Pallace, where the Empreſſe <hi>Grydonia</hi> hauing richly furniſhed many ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, euery one was ſeated according to his woorth and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimate: the newe Knights and other Princes, at Tables by themſelues, and the Ladies with their daughters, at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by themſelues. The feaſt was aunſwerable to ſuch a time of ſolemnitie, and the tables beeing withdrawne, the newe Knights went ioyntly to the Emperour together, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring
<pb facs="tcp:14347:51"/>
that now they might procéede to the Tournament: for diuers Pagan Princes were already there arriued, with eſpeciall intent to make knowne their hardines, and ſome of them hauing ſeene the forementioned Ladies, were in theyr heat of affection become ſo amourous, as they prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed all meanes to be poſſeſſed of theſe beauties, and haue them thence with them into their owne Countries, if by theyr chiualrie they could attaine to ſuch happines.</p>
               <p>Thether was come a ſonne of <hi>Sucuſanos</hi> the Soldane of <hi>Perſia,</hi> who was called <hi>Salaman:</hi> and from <hi>Romata</hi> came the young King <hi>Gorgoneo,</hi> who forgetfull of the benefites his Graund-father receiued by <hi>Palmerin d' Oliua,</hi> ioyned in confederacie with <hi>Sucuſano,</hi> &amp; both theſe Princes were purpoſely come thether, to pry into the procéedings of the Chriſtians, and thereby to catch occaſion of a newe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of warre.</p>
               <p>There was alſo arriued a King of <hi>India,</hi> called <hi>Tamer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co,</hi> who had brought his Siſter with him, a Lady of ſuch beauty, as ſhée was enuied of very many, and thought to be fayre by the Chriſtians themſelues: this he did as moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued thereto by a vaine opinion, thinking to equall any Chriſtian Lady with his Siſters beautie. <hi>Tinto</hi> King of <hi>Armenia</hi> was likewiſe there, the onely valiant man of his perſon, and moſt famous amongſt the Pagans: and had he not died by miſhap in the Tourney, the victory had not gone on the newe made Knights ſide. Thether came alſo the Prince of <hi>Apuglia,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Antwerpe,</hi> who was a Chriſtian, and many other great perſonages of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, whoſe names ſhall be reported in theyr apt time and place.</p>
               <p>The Emperour gaue authoritie to the Duke of <hi>Pera,</hi> to ſée the Liſts prepared, and to take care for the obſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the lawes to a Tournament belonging, wherein it was prouided, that neither Sword, Mace, nor Poleaxe ſhould be brought within the Liſts, but onely the Launce, whereof tenne were allowed to euery Knight, who hauing runne and broken their ſtaues, ſhould depart &amp; giue place
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:14347:51"/>
to all freſh commers. The new Knights came with their attendants in coſtly liueries, to make the ſhewe appeare more pompous, the like obſeruation was among the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: and the limitted day béeing come, they entred accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to appoyntment within the Liſtes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leonato</hi> and <hi>Arguto</hi> had the honour to beginne, the firſt with <hi>Salaman,</hi> and brake their Launces brauely, parting thence without any aduantage diſcerned, more on one ſide then another. The ſecond encountred <hi>Tinto</hi> of <hi>Armenia,</hi> and by ouer-much haſt failed in the breake: neuertheleſſe, their Shieldes ſo mainly met together, as the horſes (not able to endure the ſhocke) fell downe, that belonging to <hi>Tinto,</hi> breaking one of his legges behind in the fall, and <hi>Leonatos</hi> three of his ribbs in the ſide. The Knights quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leaping from their ſadles, and hauing no ſwords to enter further tryall, ſtoode as men diſcontented: but the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour (ſome-what diſpleaſed that two ſuch Knights were thus excluded the Iouſt, without any fault by themſelues co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted) gaue this ſentence, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the foyle of the horſes, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the hardiment of the Knights, did not depriue them of fame or reputation, and therefore with freſh horſes they ſhould once more try their fortune.</p>
               <p>While theſe two Knights were gone to prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, <hi>Tarnaes</hi> entred the Liſtes, againſt whom <hi>Gorgoneo</hi> aduaunced foorth himſelfe, this encounter was with ſuch fierceneſſe performed, that <hi>Tarnaes</hi> bare away the Pagans ſhoulder-plate, and <hi>Gorgoneo</hi> brake his Shielde in two parts: then turning to recouer other Launces, they inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to approue which of them exceeded the other in valour. But the Emperour, who would not that any one ſhoulde miſcary in this Tournament, hauing an eſpeciall and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident care, that no Pagan Prince ſhould be offended, and thereon to ground a newe occaſion of warre, the <hi>Grecian</hi> Empire béeing yet but in weake eſtate, and hauing heard likewiſe of the procéedings in <hi>Turkie,</hi> ordained immediatly, that the Knights ſhould take newe Armes for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> loſt, and ſo without any blame to enter the Liſtes againe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14347:52"/>
                  <hi>Tamarco</hi> was nowe prepared for the Iouſt, and <hi>Belcar</hi> the man hee was to cope withall, who beeing as yet but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie young, could not withſtand the ſhock, but fel backward ouer the crupper of his horſe: when preſently <hi>Fortenbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio</hi> made againſt <hi>Tamarco,</hi> and ſuch was his ſucceſſe, that <hi>Tamarco</hi> loſt his ſtirrop, and nodded forward verie neere falling: but <hi>Fortenbracio</hi> had ſuch a ſtroke on the ſide, as he had kiſt the ground, but that very quickly hee recouered himſelfe againe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Franardo,</hi> who beheld a Giant of <hi>Trebiſonde</hi> preparing himſelfe to the Iouſt, made forth to encounter him: but by reaſon of his great ſtrength, &amp; more agility to armes then the Pagan had, he made him try his length along vpon the earth, hurte both with the Launce, as alſo the fall. Thys highly did content the Emperour, to behold ſhining in him the vertues of <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> his Father: and <hi>Arlencea</hi> his mother, who among the other Ladies ſtood to ſée the ſports, was not a little delighted to ſee this ſight, to behold her ſon ſo eſpecially honoured, and to beare away the victory from his enemy.</p>
               <p>A brother to the Giant ſo lately diſmounted, woulde néedes reuenge the others diſgrace, but hee dealing with <hi>Almaroll,</hi> the ſonne to valiant <hi>Almaroll,</hi> though ſmall ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie ſéemed to be betwéene them, yet the Giant felt his braines ſomewhat dizzied and diſtracted. <hi>Caro</hi> encountred with the Prince of <hi>Apuglia: Eſtellant</hi> with the Earle of <hi>Antwerpe: Orino</hi> and <hi>Armindo</hi> with two Kings, one of <hi>Lamech,</hi> the other of <hi>Cuſco.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eſtrellant</hi> afterward Iouſted with an vnknown Knight, who tooke diſdaine to be ſhooke in his ſaddle, albeit he ſaw it apparantly noted, and therefore it ſtood him to ſit the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer. He gallantly managed his horſe about the Liſtes, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſing euery one that came to deale with him, and the mixture of the Knights was nowe in ſuch a confuſed man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as he could not ſuddenly apprehend which part was of moſt valour, nor to which ſide he might beſt appoynt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: wherefore at aduenture hee tooke the Pagan ſide,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:14347:52"/>
which euen then was ready to forſake the place, becauſe that <hi>Tinto</hi> of <hi>Armenia,</hi> the onely flower of all the Pagans, had receiued a blow, not ſeene from whom, and hee lifting vp his arme, as it were to aunſwere his enemie that had wounded him, he felt his ſtrength faile him, for his hurt had entred his very hart, ſo downe hée fell dead: a ſight no leſſe offenſiue to the Emperour then to the Pagans.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arguto,</hi> beholding that the Knight vnknowne had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted <hi>Eſtrellant, Belcar, Armindo,</hi> and was now to giue the like curteſie to <hi>Almaroll,</hi> gaue forth himſelfe to reuenge their miſ-fortunes: and the vnknowne gallant perceiuing him, they ranne three Launces with ſuch furie, as all the beholders expected nothing but death on each ſide, and no aduauntage as yet could be diſcerned, but that <hi>Arguto</hi> was ſomewhat dazzeld at the third ſhocke, whereas the Knight vnknowne, ſate ſtill freſh and luſtie, to the admiration of all the Knights which had runne already, expecting nowe ſome matter of great valour to be performed betwéen theſe two Knights.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arguto,</hi> who little dreampt on ſo ſharpe an entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, grew excéedingly aſhamed of himſelfe, that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant <hi>Victoria,</hi> who was in the window with the other La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, ſhould ſée him ſo diſgraced: therefore to amend that miſchaunce, he verily purpoſed the death of the vnknowne Knight, who ſtil demeaned himſelfe ſo worthily in Armes, as the Pagans (thinking him to be the like) greatly tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed ouer the other. So comming with a péece of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſharpe poynted Launce, hée gaue a thruſt there-with at the flanck of the Knight vnknowne, which happening where the Vaunt-plate was not well ioyned, might much haue endamaged him: and but that he rarely ſhunned it, by an encounter of <hi>Franardo,</hi> who at that inſtant was coping with him, he there had ſlaine him.</p>
               <p>This diſcourteous deed ſo diſpleaſed the Emperour, and all the by-ſtanders, as preſently there grew a generall murmure, euery one ſaying: that a Knight neuer ought to ſake aduantage by trecherie, or by any baſe meanes to
<pb facs="tcp:14347:53"/>
diſhonour his owne reputation.</p>
               <p>The vnknowne Knight, foreſéeing the harme intended, made forward to <hi>Arguto,</hi> and hauing nothing to hurt him withall, caught faſt hold about his middle, the like did the other by him: and tugging ſo together for an indifferent while, their ſtriuing was ſo troubleſome to their horſes, (much wearied with Iouſting) that they both fell downe vnder their maiſters, but themſelues recouered footing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine very quickly, and catching like faſt hold on each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as before, the ſtrength of all the by-ſtanders in the Liſtes could not part them, no nor the out-cries made to them by the Emperour: who fearing to ſée the death of two ſo valiant Knights, forſooke his Scaffold of ſtate where hée ſate, and entred the Liſtes with his weapon drawne, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with <hi>Tryneus</hi> Emperour of <hi>Almaine,</hi> who could not make one in this Tournament, becauſe hée found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe very vnapt and ſickly.</p>
               <p>The Knights beholding the Emperours ſo néere, let goe theyr hold of theyr owne accord, and ſtepping forward to him to requeſt his departure thence againe, the Helmet fell off from <hi>Primaleons</hi> head: for <hi>Arguto</hi> ſtill purſuing his intent of aduantage, in the time of their ſo ſtrict buſtling to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, had cut the laces in ſunder. But when the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour had knowledge of him, very graciouſly he embraced him, and taking him by the hand, conducted him to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe <hi>Grydonia</hi> and the other Ladies, who were not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle deſirous to know of whence he was.</p>
               <p>Nowe they perceiuing him to be the young <hi>Primaleon,</hi> the Empreſſe caught him by the hand, and plucking him gladly to her, kiſſed him oftentimes: but <hi>Miragarda,</hi> bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ouer-come with excéeding ioy, could not brooke with patience his ſo long ſtay from her, and therefore without excuſe or otherwiſe, ſhée went and tooke him in her armes, and that in ſuch manner, as ſhe wreſted him quite out of the Empreſſes hand, whereat both the Emperour and all there preſent, laughed hartily. The mother ſatiſ-fied with her kinde embracings, gaue him leaue elſe where to diſpoſe
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:14347:53"/>
himſelfe, and he who was not meanely inſtructed in court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, went firſt and kiſſed the hand of his Aunte the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe <hi>Bazilia</hi> afterward to the Quéenes and all the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes: but when he came to doe that curteous office to the Infant <hi>Victoria,</hi> he felt himſelfe ſuddenly ſurprized with an vnaccuſtomed paſſion, and noting wel her face, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred that he had elſewhere beheld her, but neuer bethought him of his dreame.</p>
               <p>The Lady, who as yet had neuer felt any amourous fire, was ſo well pleaſed with his affable preſence, as ſhée forgot to with-draw her hand backe from him, but continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on ſuch kinde diſcourſe with him, and amiable geſtures, that <hi>Arguto,</hi> who ſtood and aduiſedly marked this behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, thought he ſhould haue died with extremitie of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For albeit hee had made many ſignes of loue to her, yet ſhee as yet had neuer requited him with any, or declared that he was eſtéemed by her at all.</p>
               <p>And heere began a hatred of long continuaunce, till ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying with a Siſter to the ſaid <hi>Primaleon,</hi> which <hi>Miragar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> was deliuered off in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and named <hi>Concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> whoſe name and nature afterward wrought that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie effect: for by her were <hi>Primaleon</hi> &amp; <hi>Arguto</hi> drawne to amitie: likewiſe was borne of <hi>Polynarda</hi> a beautiful may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, who at the ſame time was called <hi>Fior-nouella.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The careſſes and embracings on all ſides finiſhed, and euery one departed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Liſtes, the Pagans came with theyr Helmets off into the Pallace, to behold the Court of the noble Emperor, but eſpecially the Ladies, whoſe beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were blazed thorow the whole world: and <hi>Tamerco</hi> led <hi>Auriana</hi> his Siſter with him, a young Lady, but of fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>téene yéeres of age, ſo faire and richly adorned after the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian manner, that all began to grow in admiration of her, forſaking their opinion of them whom they ſaw daily. And indeed ſhee carryed herſelfe with ſuch a ſtately geſture, that the Ladies of the Court (noting theyr loue ſeruants to eye her ſo entirely) beganne to wexe iealous and doubtfull of them.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXII. How the Knights of <hi>Tubante</hi> combatted againſt the Pagane Kings, and howe the Citty was neere hand looſing, by a trecherous deuiſe that <hi>Ristorano</hi> wrought.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Almerin, Florendos, Dramuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ande,</hi> and <hi>Berolde,</hi> who were to fight the Combate with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gane Kings: armed themſelues earlie the morning following, and went foorth into the Fielde, whether ſoone after came the thrée Kings and the Giant, who becauſe they rather fought for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of glory, then any couetous affection after rule and Emperie, ſaluted our Chriſtian Champions very kindly, as if they had béene friendes and acquaintance, perhaps more to ſée y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faces of thoſe Knights, whoſe fame and reputation was reckoned ſo great, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other reſpect of affabilitie, when beholding their lookes to be ſo gentle and debonnaire, they made the leſſe account of whatſoeuer might be in them.</p>
               <p>The Pagane Giant, who was farre greater in ſtature then <hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> came with a ſmile and tooke him by the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:14347:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hand, thinking with a by-wreſt to ouerthrowe him on the earth: but he béeing of a very great ſpirit, and not ſo eaſie to be ouerturned, vnawares (with his yron Gauntlet) gaue the other ſuch a blow on the face, as made him ſtagger to and fro. So beganne the fight betwixt them without anie Iouſting, and embracing ſtrongly together, fell both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide their horſes: but béeing recouered vppon their feete a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, ſtoutly with their ſwords they hackt and hewed each other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Palmerin</hi> and the reſt perceiuing the fight was begun, challenged them foorth whom they were to deale withall: <hi>Carino,</hi> King of <hi>Illium,</hi> went againſt <hi>Florendos,</hi> and they combatted in the midſt amongſt the other. <hi>Drago</hi> of <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phis</hi> vndertooke <hi>Palmerin,</hi> and <hi>Stupendo</hi> the <hi>Scithian,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred <hi>Berold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Launces which <hi>Carino</hi> and <hi>Florendos</hi> ranne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, were ſo tough &amp; boyſtrous, that they would not breake, but bare both the Champions to the ground, with the ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles betwéene their legges, but quickly getting foote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, they drew their ſwords and cheerefully fell to it. <hi>Palmerin</hi> receiued ſuch a ſalutation from <hi>Drago,</hi> as hee (minding more <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> who was down on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground, then the perrill whereto hee appoſed himſelfe) had almoſt kiſt the grounde for his negligence, and fayled of any ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe with his owne Launce. But comming afterward to try it by the ſword, he deliuered ſuch forcible ſtrokes at his enemy, that <hi>Drago</hi> béeing glad to make his ſhield his beſt ſhelter, had it cleft in two parts, and his Helmet ſhrewdly battered beſide.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Drago,</hi> who neuer dreampt of any ſuch vallour in a Chriſtian, began to conſider with himſelfe, that if now hée did not declare his very vttermoſt man-hood, hee ſawe no way but immediat death: wherefore bringing his ſworde ouer his head with a backe ſtroake, it lighted ſo ſhrewdlie on the ſide of <hi>Palmerins</hi> head, that it made him reele about in ſuch ſort, as if he had not ſuddenly ſette his ſword to the ground with his right hand, he néedes muſt haue tumbled
<pb facs="tcp:14347:55"/>
ouer and ouer. But that helpe ſeruing him in his need, as a good ſupport, and he now ſoundly acquainted with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Kings ſtrength, ſhewed himſelfe not ſlacke in aunſwering ſtroke for ſtroke, ſo the fight as yet continued betwixt them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any great difference.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stupendo</hi> was valiantly encountred by <hi>Berolde,</hi> both of them in the ſhocke beeing diſmounted, and referred to the combate of the ſword: wherein the King behaued himſelfe very gallantly, but <hi>Berolde</hi> by his more agill turnings and windings, cauſed many of his huge blowes to be ſpent but in vaine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Florendos</hi> had hurt <hi>Carino</hi> in the ſword hand, by béeing more ſkilfull in his weapon then he: and <hi>Palmerin</hi> founde <hi>Drago</hi> ſo deſperate and reſolute, as he very much doubted the iſſue of their Combate: but all this might iuſtly be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as nothing, in reſpect of the fight betweene <hi>Dramuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ande</hi> and <hi>Lamiro</hi> the Giant, for they fought more by force and meere might, then any engenie or cunning, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> ſéeing his enemie obſerue no order of Combate, which hindered him often from many proffered aduantages, began to chéere himſelfe with this hope, that this immoderate furie would at length tyre the Giant, and ſo he held him play vpon ſo faire a likelihood: beſide, he had already wounded him in the left ſide, whereout the blood did iſſue aboundantly, both which confirmed his not long continuance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stupendo</hi> had ſlightly hurt <hi>Berolde</hi> in two places, and he had awarded his aduerſarie ſo well, that himſelfe receiued a wound vpon his eye-brow: ſo the blood tricking downe, much hindered his ſight, and aduantaged <hi>Berolde</hi> in his further procéeding.</p>
               <p>The Knights in the Citty grewe ſuſpitious of ſome tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie, becauſe they beheld diuers betake them to theyr Launces, whereon they forth-with armed themſelues, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting downe this order: that <hi>Platir, Pompides, Dirdan,</hi> and <hi>Blandidon,</hi> ſhould goe forth of the Citty, accompanied with fiftie other valiant Knights, as a defence to them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> fought
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:14347:55"/>
the Combate, and that <hi>Florian, Dragonalte, Gracian, Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,</hi> and <hi>Floraman,</hi> ſhould be readie armed in the Cittie with all the Caualierie, beſide fiue thouſand Turkes ſworne faythfull to <hi>Targiana,</hi> and many of them ſecretlie baptized.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Riſtorano,</hi> who beheld the fight to faile on theyr ſide whom he truſted, when he ſaw <hi>Platir</hi> and the reſt iſſue forth of the Citty, commaunded tenne thouſand horſe to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die within halfe a mile of the field, cloaking his intent with this excuſe, that they were but to guard the Kinges from treaſon: likewiſe he placed an ambuſh in a wood, which was not aboue a bowe ſhoote from the Combattants. All which béeing doone, hee cauſed a great huge ſtone to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vp, that couered the mouth of a Caue or vault, from whence was a paſſage vnder the Citty. This conueiance was long before made by a certaine Lord, as a meanes for his owne eſcape, when any harme ſhould happen to the Citty, and <hi>Targiana</hi> béeing a woman of no ſuch ſuſpect, knew nothing of this vault, nor any about her.</p>
               <p>His armed Souldiours entring this Cauerne, they were to riſe in the houſe of the Prince of <hi>Antioche,</hi> who percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing he could not ioyne in marriage with <hi>Targiana,</hi> feyned himſelfe to be ſicke, as no way willing to impeach y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> war, but expecting ſtill ſome occaſion of treaſon. Hee hearing them breaking the ground in his houſe, and that there ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a vaulte to be vnderneth, whereby might growe ſome matter of conſequence, called certaine of his faithful atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants vnto him, and commaunding them to breake open the vault aboue, beheld vnderneath the Enſignes of <hi>Riſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rano,</hi> which on purpoſe were carryed formoſt, for the ſpée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die knowledge of his people.</p>
               <p>This aduenture ſo highly pleaſed the Prince of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oche,</hi> that he ſuffered them gladly to come forth, and there now appeared to be a full Court. But a Chriſtian Knight, who vſed to walke euery way of the Citty, to note what the Turkes eyther ſayd or did, leaning to a wall that abut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on this place, heard what a murmuring ſo many people
<pb facs="tcp:14347:56"/>
made within, and cauſing very ſoftly a litle rift to be made, beheld of what a multitude they conſiſted, where-vpon hee poſted immediatly to <hi>Floraman,</hi> and to him diſcouered thys vnlooked for accident.</p>
               <p>The Captaine, béeing a man of mighty courage, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maied not a iote, but hauing imparted theſe newes to Prince <hi>Florian</hi> and the reſt, they all went preſently to the Prince of <hi>Antioches</hi> Pallace: prouiding that ſo many men ſhould not come foorth into the Citty, neither that theyr number ſhould be any further increaſed, by that or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſſage vnder the ground. Then aduertiſing <hi>Targia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> to fortifie herſelfe in the Caſtell, without any noyſe they gathered their ſtrength together, thoſe foure thouſand vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the conduct of <hi>Blandidon,</hi> and two thouſand which were in the Caſtell of <hi>Albayzo,</hi> leauing the Turkiſh power for guarde of the Caſtell: ſo marching ſoftly to the Princes Pallace, they found the gate open, where preſentlie they entred, and nowe intended to make proofe of theyr va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Florian</hi> méeting the Prince of <hi>Antioche,</hi> calling him him Traytor, ſlew him at one blow, by reaſon he was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed: his death gaue the victory to our Chriſtian forces, becauſe the Pagans béeing there thus ſuddenly amazed, and ignorant of further proceeding into the Citty, whereof the Prince of <hi>Antioche</hi> had before receiued the ful charge, they fell to a confuſion among themſelues, and the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to diſcréet and orderly care of their charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dragonalte, Francian,</hi> and an hundred more with them, were gotten vp on the battlements of the Pallace, and thence tumbled downe huge ſtones ſo mainely, that the Courts béeing full of the enemies Souldiours, they bray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them in great multitudes together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Floraman,</hi> with <hi>Florian, Gracian,</hi> and their followers, ſawe that diuers ſought to ſaue themſelues thorowe the vaults paſſage againe: but that was quickly rammd vp with dead bodies, and no way nowe left for them but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent death, thus was the ſafetie of the Citty aſſured, and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:14347:56"/>
many throwing downe their weapons to the ground, vpon their knees intreated pardon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Riſtorano,</hi> who not knowing of this ill ſucceſſe, but ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining the ſight to be as then ſcarce begunne in the Citty, and that all things would fall out to his contentment, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the tenne thouſand and thoſe ambuſhed in the wood, to ruſh foorth vpon the Chriſtian Combattants, to make them ſure for euer ſéeing theyr Countries any more, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with thirtie thouſand men very well appointed, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to goe and beleager the Citty walls, <hi>Platir</hi> behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſuch a power to appeare, prepared to ſuccour his friendes, and founde that <hi>Palmerin</hi> (to frée himſelfe from further danger) had cleft both the Helmet and head of <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> and there hee lay gaſping and ſprawling vppon the earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> hauing the Giant faſt about the middle, got him downe vnderneath him, but could not kill him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he béeing fearefull of death, had got him faſt by the hand wherein he held his weapon, and able to remooue no further, there they lay both tumbling ready to be trodden on.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Palmerin</hi> perceiuing the treaſon toward, and the danger of <hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> gaue the Giant ſuch a ſtroke on the ſide, as making him let goe his hold, gaue <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> libertie to recouer his feete againe, and ſo together they prepared for their enemies approching. <hi>Carino,</hi> beeing a Knight of an honourable diſpoſition, calling <hi>Stupendo</hi> to him, excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Chriſtian Combattants very much, as no way de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing to be thus intrapt by treaſon, &amp; ſo withdrew them among their people.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Florendos</hi> and his companions, ſeazing on ſuch horſes, as were neereſt hand, firſt killing their riders, made after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb facs="tcp:14347:57"/>
with what ſpeede they could to the Cittie, but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at their backes aboue twentie thouſand to withſtand them, could hardly geſſe what ſhould now become of them. <hi>Riſtorano</hi> beeing gotten to the Cittie wall, vnregarded of any within to reſiſt him, becauſe as yet the ſtirre was not ended at the Prince of <hi>Antioches</hi> Pallace, and the Turks had ſhut vp themſelues in their houſes, expecting to ſée the Chriſtians ſo weakened, as man to man might ſley them ſafely: euen as they were paſſing along the ditches, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Squires belonging to <hi>Platir,</hi> that watched vpon the gates by his appointment, to eſpy a farre off any trecherie intended, beholding the imminent perrill, one ran preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>Floraman</hi> to acquaint him there-with, who leauing there <hi>Florian, Gracian, Francian,</hi> and two thouſand armed men, went with <hi>Dragonalte</hi> and the reſt of the Souldiers to defend the walls, calling likewiſe thoſe Turkes along with him that guarded the Caſtell, and his comming the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was in very apt ſeaſon, becauſe an enemie Banner was already ſpred on a Turret adioyning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dragonalte</hi> made no meane haſt to bee there, where mounting his Turkes ſo faſt as he could, and cutting him quite through the midſt that held the Banner, it encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged all the reſt to mount ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>rely after them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Riſtorano,</hi> ſéeing the wall in that quarter ſo ſtronglie manned, cauſed his men to get vp in diuers other places, and (deſpight of all the Chriſtians could doe,) aboue tenne thouſand Turkes were got vpon the walls, who began to deſcend downe into the Cittie, by the helpe of diuers falſe-harted Cittizens, that rather then the Chriſtians ſhould be Conquerers, were content to take part with the enemy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Florian, Gracian,</hi> and <hi>Francian,</hi> behaued themſelues wonderfully, but when they heard the enemies had aſſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the walls, and danger appeared of yeelding in the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, they could not readily determine what to doe: for they which had yéelded before at the Pallace, beholding the Chriſtians now in ſo narrow a ſtraight, forgot all former receiued fauour, and ioyned with the reſt to murder theyr
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:14347:57"/>
preſeruers, but all this ſorted to very ſlender effect, ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thilie did our Chriſtian Knights withſtand their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Floraman, Dragonalte,</hi> and their followers, fought ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie valiantly, and the Pagans thronged together in ſuch huge troopes, as they hindered one another from mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the walls: and but for thoſe Turkes that were friends and ſworne to <hi>Targiana,</hi> the Citty doubtleſſe had béen loſt. For they tooke away certaine vnder-ſhoaring Rampiers and ſupporters, which on the inſide vpheld the maine ſtrength of the wall: and when it was loaden with aboue thirtie thouſand perſons, downe fell they into the ditches, and the battlements vpon them, and there they all periſhed without one eſcaping.</p>
               <p>This miſhap not a little diſpleaſed <hi>Riſtorano,</hi> whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he thought beſt to make toward the Chriſtian Knights, as hoping by their deaths to end this controuerſie, much more the ſooner be poſſeſſed of the Cittie. The Pagans that oppoſed themſelues againſt Prince <hi>Florian,</hi> when they ſawe what a loſſe had ſucceeded, by the walls fall, they were ſo affrighted, that hurling downe their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, they humbly intreated for ſafetie of their liues: but they that had experience of theyr former trechery, and how bloodily they procéeded in all their actions, would lende no eare to them, but ſlew them apace on euery ſide, and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie had they made an end of them all, if a meſſenger had not come from <hi>Floraman,</hi> who gaue them to vnderſtand, that <hi>Florendos</hi> and his friendes were ſhutte vp in the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Campe, and no meanes for their eſcape was nowe to be had, but by thruſting foorth part of thoſe Turkes to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour them.</p>
               <p>Theſe newes ſaued the liues of ſixe thouſand Turkes, who perceiuing <hi>Targianas</hi> affaires to ſpéede better then theyrs, lifting vp theyr hands all diſarmed, made a ſigne that they would fight faithfully for the Chriſtians. <hi>Florian,</hi> although he could not well truſt them, yet beholding the neceſſity of their owne extremity, gaue them their Armes,
<pb facs="tcp:14347:58"/>
and promiſed them many great rewards if they proued loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, appointing them alſo the charge of that part where the wall was falne, as the beſt way to make triall of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie.</p>
               <p>So ioyning with <hi>Floraman,</hi> and leauing <hi>Dragonalte</hi> with two thouſand for ſafetie of the Citty, they iſſued foorth on the enemie, finding in one part <hi>Platir, Pompides, Dir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> and <hi>Blandidon,</hi> who had made themſelues way tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the crowde, with no meane ſlaughter of theyr ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: after them followed <hi>Palmerin</hi> and the other three, ſo wearied with their combate and fighting all day, that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hardly could they lift theyr ſwordes: yet were they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſtand vppon their owne defence, becauſe <hi>Vlderino</hi> King of <hi>Tanais,</hi> with two ſonnes of his that were two Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, continually purſued them, and had preuailed ſhrewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie againſt them, if <hi>Florian, Floraman,</hi> and <hi>Platir</hi> had not béene neere, who vndertaking the quarrell with <hi>Vlderino</hi> and his ſonnes gaue roome for the foure to paſſe the preaſe, though encloſed with the enemie ſtill on euery ſide.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Platir</hi> buckled cloſe with <hi>Vlderino,</hi> and at the firſt ſtroke cleft his Shielde through the midſt, himſelfe receiuing a ſmall hurt in the left hand. <hi>Florian</hi> encountred <hi>Arabo</hi> one of the Giants, and had a blowe from him that made him ſtagger: but <hi>Florian</hi> loth to die in his debt, returned him ſuch a requitall for it, as he wounded him ſome-what déepe vppon his right ſhoulder. <hi>Traccio</hi> the other Giant, gaue <hi>Floraman</hi> a thwarting ſtroake, and therewith had borne him to the earth, but that his Launce kept him vp in his ſaddle, by the rude ſhock hee gaue the Giant: notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, he was a little giddied, at which aduantage the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant tooke faſt hold of him, and lifting him quite beſide his horſe, thought thus to beare him away to his Pauillion, and there to teare him in peeces at his pleaſure, but that the crowde of people was his onely hinderance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Palmerin</hi> being by this time ſomewhat refreſhed among the Chriſtians, when hee heard the caſe of <hi>Floraman,</hi> hee tooke a Launce to purſue <hi>Traccio,</hi> who yet had gotten no

great diſtance of ground: and running him in at the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, quite through the breaſt, had likewiſe ſlaine <hi>Floraman</hi> before him, but that the Launce brake.</p>
               <p>This accident beheld by the Pagans, made them ſo fearefull and diſmayed, that they began to retire, ſome one way, ſome another, and <hi>Floraman</hi> falling to the earth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſlaine Giant, was very ſore preſt with his heauie weight vpon him, yet made hee good ſhyft to get from vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath him, and taking hold of a ſtrayed Courſer moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vpon him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vlderino</hi> was ſo full of rage for the death of his ſonne, that <hi>Platir</hi> (amongſt all the reſt) hee choſe to reuenge his furie on, and indeed had handled him very vnhappily, but that <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> hauing bound vp ſome ſmall woundes of his owne, interpoſed himſelfe with <hi>Berolde</hi> betweene the danger intended, and nowe the fight began to alter other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, for thether flocked all <hi>Vlderinos</hi> Caualierie, &amp; <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> with <hi>Arabo</hi> were ſhouldered in among them.</p>
               <p>The battaile grew to be very dangerous, for <hi>Riſtorano</hi> came freſh vpon them, with forty thouſand men, which he had gathered from the vttermoſt margents of the Armie, againſt which multitude fought valiantly <hi>Pompides, Dir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> &amp; <hi>Blandidon,</hi> ſhewing vnexpreſſable deeds of valour.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Arabo</hi> beheld his Father in great danger, with his Mace he gaue ſuch a blow at <hi>Florian,</hi> (who had an eye to ſuccour his Brother <hi>Platir,</hi> beholding that the blood gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed out at his noſe, by a ſtroke which he had receiued from <hi>Vlderino</hi>) that it wounded him in ſuch ſort, as had not <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merin</hi> ſtept in to ſuccour him, he had falne among the horſe féete, and there beene trodden to death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> hauing cleft <hi>Vlderinos</hi> Helmet through the midſt, had likewiſe ſlaine him, if <hi>Carinos</hi> other Giant had not béene his hinderance, for he ſtrooke <hi>Berolde</hi> with his Mace quite out of his ſaddle, and falling downe, he was reputed for dead. <hi>Palmerin,</hi> béeing loth to looſe any of the Chriſtian Princes, noted the Giant at his firſt intruſion, and had ſtopt his way, but for the peoples concourſe, before
<pb facs="tcp:14347:59"/>
that <hi>Berolde</hi> was in ſuch perrill: but being compeld to ſtay for better aduauntage, thruſt by where <hi>Florian</hi> fought with <hi>Arabo,</hi> and wounding the Giant firſt vppon the left ſhoulder, gaue him next ſuch a gaſh vppon the head, as hee had forthwith died of that terrible hurt, but for immediate ſuccour which came to reſcue him: and they perceiuing him to be likewiſe ſore wounded in the ſide, aduiſed him to get a while out of the throng, for very hardly could he ſtand on his leggs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vlderino,</hi> ſéeing his Helmet ſplit about his eares, would gladly haue fled, but <hi>Gratian</hi> meeting with him, (for <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſiande</hi> beeing wounded by <hi>Vlderino</hi> in the throat, was with-drawne vpon that hurt) beholding his Helmet off, cleft him downe to the breſt. <hi>Arabo</hi> grew ſtarke mad whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaw his Father fall downe dead, and therefore thruſt in with ſuch rage amongſt them, as wounding <hi>Florendos</hi> firſt on the ſide of his head, hee made toward <hi>Gracian,</hi> on him to reuenge his Fathers blood: and queſtionleſſe had preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in his purpoſe, but that <hi>Florendos,</hi> ſcorning to receaue ſuch a hurt without requitall, gaue him ſuch a thruſt in the bottome of his belly, as his guts began to fall foorth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, &amp; the Giant perceiuing himſelfe paſt all hope of eſcape, caught <hi>Florendos</hi> beſides his horſe in his armes, intending ſo to haue cruſht him to death.</p>
               <p>This great danger of <hi>Florendos,</hi> and rauing out-cryes of the Giant, made the people on both ſides to troope to that place, as iudging the fight to be there moſt cruell: but <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir,</hi> hauing now well recouered his former faintnes, behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his brother in ſuch a deſperate eſtate, ſtept forward to ſuccour him, and finding one of <hi>Carinos</hi> cooſins there, ready to kill <hi>Florendos,</hi> he ſmote him downe dead at the very firſt ſtroke.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gracian</hi> béeing likewiſe by, and ſéeing <hi>Florendos</hi> downe vnder the Giant, whoſe burdenous weight was enough to ſtifle him, hee gaue him ſuch a cut vpon the chine bone, as he tumbled dead from off <hi>Florendos,</hi> who had his wind wel neere tweakt out with ſo heauie a loade, which made him
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:14347:59"/>
lye ſtill a good while without any moouing, and this bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeene by diuers, was at laſt reported to <hi>Palmerin</hi> and Prince <hi>Florian,</hi> who cut foorth way with their weapons, to be reſolued in this feare of their friende. <hi>Palmerin</hi> catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him vp in his armes, gaue him to <hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> who layd him before him vpon his horſe, and ſo like friends they conuaid him among the Chriſtian Caualierie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Blandidon, Pompides, Dirdan,</hi> and <hi>Francian,</hi> had much adoe to get on toward the Cittie, becauſe one of <hi>Riſtoranos</hi> brethren, and others of his kindred, had ſo narrowly beſet them in euery place, as they were oftentimes in very great hazards. <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> hauing borne <hi>Florendos</hi> foorth of the ſquadron, he began to recouer his ſences againe, and imagining he was carried by the Giant his enemie, ſtrooke backward at him with the dagger he held in his hand, and wounded <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> in the ſide, who ſayde vnto him: How now my Lord, reſpect you not your friends? <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos,</hi> perceiuing the fault he had committed, leapt downe on his feete, and would haue deſired pardon, but <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> thus ſpake: It is no time now my Lord to vſe complement of wordes, rather get to horſe againe, and let vs into the battaile, and redéeme our deere friendes, whoſe liues are in danger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Palmerin</hi> hearing the terrifying noyſe, where <hi>Riſtorano</hi> and his friends had ſo beſet <hi>Blandidon</hi> and others, imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned there to be moſt neede of his preſence, and <hi>Pompides</hi> followed him, there he found <hi>Blandidon</hi> hardly engirt with two valiant Knights, who ſtill had freſh ſupply to backe them, and there hee had béene ſlaine, if <hi>Florendos</hi> had not ſtept in amongſt them, who at the firſt ſtroke kild one of the Knights, and they together made ſuch hauock of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſiſters, as the Pagans (not accuſtomed to endure ſuch blowes) ſtroue who ſhould get furtheſt from this maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> with <hi>Dirdan,</hi> ſuccoured <hi>Blandidon</hi> &amp; <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir,</hi> who had made ſuch ſlaughter on euery ſide about them, as méere wearines would not permit them ſcarce to lyft
<pb facs="tcp:14347:60"/>
their weapons: there ſlewe they in ſhort while ſo manie Pagans, that their death bréeding a diſmay in ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held it, made them giue way for the Chriſtians to reſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues a little, which time of breathing renewing their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer courage, they followed freſhly on them with <hi>Dramu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiands</hi> ſquadron, making a mighty ſpoile of the enemy. But an other multitude of Pagans, ſuch as had not ſeene the ſharpe ſtrokes of the Chriſtians, came vppon them with a freſh charge, and <hi>Riſtorano</hi> not diſmaied with all that had happened, prouoked them forward with all his endeuour. There now began a very hote encounter on either ſide, for the Pagan Knights, béeing fiered with mightie diſdaine, to ſee ſo many of theyr greateſt Signiors ſlaine, procéeded on with ſuch violence and furie, as making no eſtimation at all of death, they gaue a very ſharpe aſſault vpon the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, who ſeeing what a huge number more they had to kill, would gladly haue returned to the Citty, for nowe ſmall hope of life was promiſed. But now to make the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt proofe of valiant defending their liues, they put them ſelues in rancks, with their faces toward the Citty: <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merin, Platir, Floraman,</hi> and their traine leading before, <hi>Florian, Berolde, Gracian, Francian</hi> and theyr followers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind: and albeit they were very curſtly handled by the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, yet in deſpight of them they got forward ſtill, and made ſuch way for themſelues with theyr weapons, that at laſt they came where <hi>Riſtoranos</hi> forces had round beſet them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Florendos</hi> and <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> with their attendants did very great ſeruice, to ſupport the ſeuerall rancks of theyr friends and Countrimen, for euer as they ſmit downe ten men to the ground, an hundred would immediatlie make freſhly vpon them. The ſquadron that was guided by <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merin</hi> and his part, brake the ring or circle of Souldiours which had inuirond them, and forward they marched tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe the throng: but béeing purſued by a ſtrong Pagan ſquadron, they were ſuddenly ſhut vp againe in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as their eſtate ſtoode then much more deſperate then
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:14347:60"/>
before. <hi>Florian,</hi> who purpoſed to die or ſaue his people, ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> had ſlaine a great Pagan Lord, ſtept to his horſe and mounted vpon him, then gallopping fierce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ie vppon the enemie, and <hi>Floraman</hi> (newly mounted) gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly following, they layd ſo about them on euery ſide, as the huge crowde of Pagans were glad to giue them paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage.</p>
               <p>So dooing incredible déedes all the way as they went, they came where <hi>Riſtorano</hi> had cauſed his men to giue a freſh charge on the Citty, with vndoubted hope that nowe they ſhould obtaine it, becauſe our Chriſtian forces were ſore wearied with fighting, and béeing taken now at thys aduauntage, no hope could remaine for ſafety of their liues, but there to be vtterly ſlaine and vanquiſhed.</p>
               <p>Our two former named Knights, held on theyr intended courſe, and an hundred choſen men very ſtiffely withſtoode them, who becauſe they deerely loued theyr Lorde <hi>Riſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> would make proofe of their valour vpon thoſe two: and ſo ſtrictly had they beſet <hi>Florian,</hi> &amp; <hi>Floraman,</hi> as there theyr liues had perriſhed, but that <hi>Florendos</hi> and <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> breaking through that quarter by chaunce, beheld theyr hard diſtreſſe, and doubting the danger which might enſue them, they got thorow the throng, reſolued to aſſiſt them, hauing left <hi>Pompides</hi> &amp; the other twaine with their ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron, which making head as boldly vpon the other part, did mightily diſappoint <hi>Riſtoranos</hi> great hope.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Florendos</hi> aſſayled that route where the two were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed, and meeting with <hi>Riſtorano,</hi> tooke ſo ſtrong hold of him, as in the ſtrugling and reſiſting, both fell beſide theyr horſes: but <hi>Riſtorano</hi> was downe vnder him, to the great perrill of <hi>Florendos</hi> life: for many darts and Launces were caſt at him by the Turkes, that in huge troopes ſtil flocked about him. But in a happy houre came thither <hi>Dirdan, Pompides,</hi> &amp; <hi>Blandidon,</hi> who allighted on foote with <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſiande,</hi> and hauing quitted the place where their friends were ſo endangered, afterward engirt <hi>Riſtorano</hi> as it had béene in a circle, who beholding nowe no other way but
<pb facs="tcp:14347:61"/>
death, for ſafety of his life yeelded himſelfe priſoner. <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merin</hi> and his compeeres were ſome-what further off, but hearing the rumor, and ſeeing howe in numbers they floc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to that place, where they vnderſtood their Lorde to be in ſuch diſtreſſe, they likewiſe would needes thether, and <hi>Palmerin</hi> hauing changed his horſe, came at laſt where hée ſawe <hi>Florendos</hi> holding <hi>Riſtorano</hi> by the arme, but by no meanes could he get into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> circle, becauſe ſo many Knights had ringd it round, though the others made what meanes they could for his entrance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Florian</hi> &amp; <hi>Floraman</hi> came thither at that inſtant, where the one helping his Brother, the other his friends <hi>Gracian</hi> and <hi>Francian,</hi> they waded through a ſtreame of blood and dead bodies, and none durſt ſtand before them but they died the death. Afterward, <hi>Palmerin</hi> béeing diſmounted, tooke the Helmet from off <hi>Riſtoranos</hi> head, who imagining his life to be now at an end, ſought what meanes hée might to haue it yet prolonged: and therefore, both with ſignes and words to his Souldiours, commaunded them to giue ouer the fight, for hee was not able to make any longer reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe the battell was not as yet ceaſſed in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> ſet <hi>Riſtorano</hi> before him on horſebacke, hauing with him <hi>Pompides, Dirdan,</hi> &amp; <hi>Berolde,</hi> who were ſore wounded, the reſt rode on toward the Flagge or Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard, about which (for defence) ſtood the flower of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and till that were downe or recouered, they could not determine on any concluſion. <hi>Florian</hi> ſtroue for the honour of beating downe the Banner, which he could not ſo eaſily compaſſe as he thought to haue doone, but by multitudes of Launces was often in great hazards: whereuppon <hi>Palme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin</hi> and his vndaunted followers, regarding honour more then life, brake through in deſpight of all that withſtoode them, and valiantly ſmote the Enſigne royall down to the ground, which was the diſcomfiture of the whole Campe, according to the Turkiſh cuſtome. So betaking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to flight, ſome one way, ſome another, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Chriſtians
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:14347:61"/>
had the fréer meanes of withdrawing thence together, and entring the Citty, <hi>Riſtorano</hi> was bounde as priſoner on a ſilly poore Nagge, for <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> coulde no longer take the charge of him, by reaſon of the dangerous hurt hée had receiued in his throate.</p>
               <p>Beeing come within the Citty, they went to be diſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and haue their wounds dreſſed, whereof not one had ſcaped free: but <hi>Palmerin, Floraman,</hi> and <hi>Florendos,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they were in the beſt eſtate, they ſhewed themſelues daily with ſuch as could be armed, becauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people ſhould not grow into weake oppinion of them, nor the enemy ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any ſtomacke of freſh aſſayling the Cittie.</p>

               <p>Prince <hi>Florian</hi> kéeping his bed by reaſon of his wounds, wrought ſo with his wife, that for her leſſe trouble in thys caſe, <hi>Riſtorano</hi> ſhould be there kept impriſoned, and refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ouer for iudgement to the Emperour <hi>Primaleon,</hi> all which accordingly was agreed vnto. <hi>Carino,</hi> (who as no

Thys fell out moſt commodious for our Chriſtian Knights, who were wounded ſo dangerouſly, eſpecially <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> in his throate, as hardly a months ſpace could ſerue for theyr recouerie: but that <hi>Dorina</hi> (who abode ſecretly in <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> to conclude the aduenture of her Monſter) reſoning on this caſe with young <hi>Primaleon,</hi> and the deſperate ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of ſo many good Knights, the onely ſupport of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Grecian</hi> Empire, was intreated by him to haue care of their liues, leaſt the enemy ſhoulde aſſaile them againe before they were cured.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Dragonalte</hi> hauing no hurts, had charge of the Citties ſafetie, and therefore daily would he walke abroade with two hundred Knights, that had likewiſe eſcaped hurting in the battaile, and they vſed ſtill to march about the walls, (laboriouſly repayring where the ruine had falne) leaſt the enemy ſhould gather any means of freſh inuaſion, and that doubt was eſpecially reſpected by <hi>Floraman,</hi> who by ſecrete ſpyes had notice of the enemies purpoſes, and therfore they were the readier for all occaſions whatſoeuer.</p>

                  <hi>Palmerin,</hi> who greeued to be thus long coopt vp in the Citty, and beholding likewiſe their ſtore of victuall to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, committing the Citties charge to <hi>Pompides, Dir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> and <hi>Gracian,</hi> armed himſelfe with the reſt, and iſſued foorth: and béeing come within a bow ſhoote of the enemies Campe, he ſent a Herald to demaund a ſingle fight. <hi>Carino</hi> knowing well the ſtoute courage of the Chriſtians, thought how to returne an indifferent aunſwere, and thus replyed:
<pb facs="tcp:14347:63"/>
that in his Campe were not Princes ſufficient to vndergoe a Combate, &amp; they beeing all Captaines of ſo great worth, did not wel in vrging a matter ſo farre vnequall, nor knew he how Fortune would determine of him, in the ſafetie or perriſhing of his people. Notwithſtanding, if they were of ſuch mettle as Fame publiſhed them to be, hee had a Monſter in his Armie, with whom they might aduenture body to body: Thys offer made <hi>Carino,</hi> as thinking for certaintie, that no one of the Knights alone could preuaile againſt his Monſter.</p>
               <p>Our valiant Caualiers hearing this aunſwere, began to conceiue this opinion among themſelues, that this prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer was the very vttermoſt refuge of the Pagans, and the Monſter béeing vanquiſhed, they were for euer foyled: ſo withdrawing aſide to further conſideration, euery one ſtroue who ſhould be the formoſt, and who ſhould firſt be armed for this encounter: for in thoſe times, neyther kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, friendſhip nor dignitie was reſpected, in any attempt where honour was to be atchiued, but euery one would make way to his owne aduauncement: but <hi>Floraman</hi> bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their elected Generall, though good to ſet downe ſome diſcreete order among them, and therefore hee beganne in this manner following.</p>
               <p>Honourable and generous ſpirits, in matter of ſo maine and important conſequence, raſh forwardnes may be as preiudiciall, as dull ſlacknes thought baſe and ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Firſt, conſider therefore the Country wherein wee are, and vpon what termes of hazard we haue béene, and yet doe ſtand in: if then you would haue the enemy vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the true weight of your worth, and howe farre you out-pace Pagans in reſolution and courage, let the care of lyfe and honour be coupled together, for to looſe eyther a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Infidels, were inglorious, and to be reſpectiue of neyther, degenerate and infamous. I would therefore ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe yée, that ſuch of you ſhall firſt fight with the Monſter, againſt whom the beaſt ſhall firſt oppoſe himſelfe, and ſo what ſoeuer happen, let the blame be imputed to fortune:
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:14347:63"/>
be ready then euery one in ſeuerall diſtances, and happie man by luck and ſucceſſe in the tryall.</p>
               <p>This counſell did highly content them all, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on aunſwere was carried to <hi>Carino,</hi> that they would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate his Monſter ſeuerally, as himſelfe had propounded: each man appointing him ſelfe to his place, where he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined the Monſter would be neereſt to him, but each one a bow ſhoote from the other.</p>

                  <hi>Carino</hi> beholding all this, beganne to doubt the iſſue of his proffered fight, as thinking that theſe vnuanquiſhable ſpirits, could runne thorowe any enterpriſe what-ſoeuer: neuertheleſſe, hee cauſed his Monſter to feede on nothing but ſtrong meates and mixed wines, which made him ſo full of ſtomack &amp; furie, as hee could not be reſtrained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in any limits. And béeing brought where he might behold theſe valiant Champions, the beaſt made firſt of all at <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonalte,</hi> getting ſo ſuddenly vppon him, as he had not the power to wound him: but béeing rapt vp between his rude armes, he would haue carried him to his Pauillion, till the Knight (doubtfull of imminent death) punched y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beaſt in the ſides with his dagger, which though it pierced not through his hard ſkinne, yet did the blowes ſo painefullie grieue him, as caſting <hi>Dragonalte</hi> againſt the ground, hée returned mainly againſt <hi>Gracian,</hi> who thought to giue him a ſound welcome becauſe he was neere him, but the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter falling on his foure féete, ſo affrighted the horſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the knight rode, that being vnable to hold him in, he was violently carried among the enemies, and there detayned as a priſoner.</p>
               <p>The Monſter next made out at <hi>Floraman,</hi> who hauing his ſword ready drawne, beſtowed many rough ſtroakes vpon the beaſt: but all to no end, his hide was ſo impierci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and the Monſter ſmote him with his horne ſo rudelie on the breaſt, that downe hee fell backward along on the ground.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Palmerin</hi> was the next he offered to deale withall, who running at him with his Launce, gaue him ſuch a forcible
<pb facs="tcp:14347:64"/>
ſtroke, as albeit it wounded him not to outward fight, yet it made him to writhe aſide, as feeling ſhrewd paine, and runne againe at the Knight ſo furiouſly, that catching faſt hold on his Launce, he got it from him, and had he beene poſſeſt of ſo much knowledge, as to haue turned the poynt vpon the owner, the ſtrife betweene them had ſoone beene concluded, for the beaſt was of ſuch powerfull ſtrength, as no Armour could haue reſiſted his blowes. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, with his hoofes and hornes hee much moleſted the Knight, and many times brought him to very deſperate ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards, till <hi>Palmerin</hi> perceiuing, that his horſe beſtird not himſelfe ſo nimbly, as in ſuch an aduenture was held moſt expedient: he quickly leapt from him, and with ſterne cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage came againſt the Monſter, who beganne to expreſſe ſignes of ioy at his béeing thus on foote, as hoping the eaſier to carry him away.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, hurling away the Launce, which he could not well graſpe in his long tallents, hee fell againe on his foure féete, fighting one while with his hornes, another while with his long clawes, whereby hee ſhrewly bruſed and battered the Knights Armour. <hi>Palmerin,</hi> who by his ſprightly agilitie well defended theſe ſharpe ſtrokes, with a downe right blow deliuered at the beaſt, cut off his left horne that bended backward, and this ſtroke was giuen with ſuch violence, as the ſword falling out of <hi>Palmerins</hi> hand, ſtucke <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ight vppon the poynt a good way in the ground: but the Monſter perceiuing hee had loſt his wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, roſe vpon his hindmoſt féete, and running haſtily vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, caught him faſt in his armes. When <hi>Palmerin</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe thus ſtrongly griped, got ſome-what thwart the beaſts breaſt, and then began to ſtruggle and writhe to get from him.</p>
               <p>The Monſter ſtill held him with ſuch ſtrength, as the valour of foure <hi>Palmerins</hi> auailed not with him, if hee had béene prouided of diſcretion to gouerne his might, but hee had no other kinde of induſtrie, but how to gripe his claws into the Knights Armour: which <hi>Palmerin</hi> féeling verie
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:14347:64"/>
ſore to afflict him, gaue ſo many ſtabbs to the beaſt with his ponyard, as beeing glad to rid himſelfe of his burden, hee ranne mainly at <hi>Florian,</hi> who minding more the ſtrange manner of theſe ſeuerall encounters, then any perrill that might happen to himſelfe, receiued ſuch a ſtroke with the beaſts forth-right horne, as deſpight of his hart feld him downe to the ground.</p>
               <p>The Monſter procéeded no further with him, but went and aſſayled <hi>Florendos,</hi> who ſtanding prepared vppon his owne guarde, defended himſelfe very gallantly: and the fight had continued long betweene them, but that <hi>Florian</hi> beeing recouered, and hauing drawne his ſword, leaſt hée ſhould be as vnaduiſedly taken as he was before, the beaſt left <hi>Florendos,</hi> and ſet againe vpon him, where now began a very fierce conflict, full of craft in the Monſter to auoyde his ſtrokes, and expreſſing an vndauntable ſpirit in the Prince.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Florian,</hi> full of nimble changes from place to place, eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped ſtill the horne and fangs of the beaſt, but he belaboured him with blowes on euery ſide: as what with wearineſſe and extremitie of paine he felt, his fierceneſſe was nothing ſo violent as at the firſt.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Carino</hi> beheld the knightly ſkill of Prince <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</hi> hee verily thought the day would be loſt, for the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter (in whom hee had no meane opinion of preuailing) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parantly he ſaw to grow weaker and weaker: wherefore, as his very lateſt refuge in this diſtreſſe, he ſent tenne thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of his ſouldiers into a wood neere adioyning, with an appoynted ſignall when they ſhould mooue thence: to wit, when himſelfe with an hundred diſarmed Knights, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing eyther ſword or Launce, ſhould enter the publique place of Combate, then ſhould the tenne thouſand iſſue forth of the wood, and ſuddenly ſet vpon the Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Carino,</hi> who would haue no hand in the other bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes treaſon, as hating to ſupport anothers trechery, and loth to mangle his honour for another mans intereſt: yet now in a matter tending to his owne benefite, had his eare
<pb facs="tcp:14347:65"/>
ſhut vp to all reſpect of ſhame and diſgrace. And yet thys policie of his was to very ſlender purpoſe, eſpyed in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging and therefore mard before effecting: for <hi>Blandidon</hi> with his troope béeing neere the wood, met with the chiefe leader of thoſe ambuſhed forces, and running him thorowe with his Launce, there he fell downe dead. This to the Chriſtians prooued very aduantageable, for when thoſe in ambuſh ſaw theyr Captaine ſlaine, and what danger de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended vpon the iſſue of this fight, that <hi>Targiana</hi> was liker to preuaile then <hi>Carino</hi> attaine to what hee deſired: they would not prepare themſelues for any further reſiſtance, but onely referred all to the ſucceſſe of the Monſter, which by this time was brought into ſuch eſtate by <hi>Florian,</hi> as the Pagans were now out of all hope of preuailing.</p>
               <p>The Prince had cut and mangled the beaſt in diuers parts of his body, driuing him vp &amp; downe the fielde at his pleaſure, vntill hauing loſt all vigour and ſtrength, he fell flatte on the ground, where <hi>Florian</hi> bound his armes and legges together, intending to ſend the beaſt to <hi>
                     <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> Carino</hi> at his fall was ſtrooken into ſuch amazement, that hauing no minde at all of his owne further perrill, hée was taken priſoner by <hi>Palmerin,</hi> and all the Turkiſh ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours in the enemies Campe, came &amp; yeelded themſelues diſarmed, promiſing true vaſſailage to <hi>Targiana,</hi> and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned they backe to the Citty in tryumph, cauſing the Monſter to be carried along with them.</p>
               <p>But Fortune permitting no man to enioy any perfect happines, thwarted this ſucceſſe in ſuch ſort, as they had not long beene in the Citty, before <hi>Pompides</hi> and <hi>Gracian</hi> came to certifie the reſt, that <hi>Dirdan,</hi> with tenne others whom he eſpecially truſted, leauing open a gate of the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, was departed thence toward <hi>Niquea:</hi> whereupon <hi>Blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didon</hi> immediatly gathered, that <hi>Dirdans</hi> intent was to ſurprize <hi>Niquea,</hi> and to enioy his Siſter <hi>Tirrena</hi> &amp; the ſtate, therefore in haſt hee would haue purſued him, but that his hurts in the late conflict did onely hinder him. But <hi>Palme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin</hi> and the reſt gaue him this comfort, that all matters
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:14347:65"/>
béeing eſtabliſhed, which nowe were in indifferent good forwardneſſe: they would then aſſiſt him againſt <hi>Dirdan,</hi> and doubtleſſe hee ſhould eaſily preuaile againſt him: by which perſwaſions <hi>Blandidon</hi> was very well pacified. So <hi>Carino</hi> beeing impriſoned where <hi>Riſtorano</hi> was detayned, they all began to reſolue on mirth and iollitie, cheefely the faire Princeſſe <hi>Targiana,</hi> who lately had béene brought to bedde of a Sonne, begotten by <hi>Albayzo</hi> her former huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band: but ſhee nor any other miſtruſting the Barons of the kingdome of <hi>Babylon,</hi> who ſecretely had ſtolne into her ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories, and becauſe <hi>Targiana</hi> was married to <hi>Florian,</hi> and was in ſhort time after to be baptized, they grewe héereon ſo malicious againſt her, that one morning they came and ſtole away the childe, departing there-with preſently to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Targiana,</hi> greatly gréeuing to haue her child ſo borne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, would gladly haue had her Knights to purſue them: but by better aduiſe it was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered, that this might moue the people of <hi>Babilon</hi> to riſe in armes, and oppreſſe the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Turkie</hi> with warre, which already was greatlie weakened, as the late paſſed troubles apparantly witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Beſide, hauing occaſion of going to <hi>Niquea,</hi> according as before they had promiſed <hi>Blandidon,</hi> they were content as yet to endure the loſſe of the Childe, ſetting downe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees for better eſtabliſhing their owne eſtate: for Princes euermore ſhould haue this reſpect, to take the moſt proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent courſes for their ſtate affayres, labouring by their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie vttermoſt meanes for the weale publique.</p>

                  <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Orina,</hi> who determined to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct young <hi>Primaleon</hi> to ſome at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of great glory, entiteling him by the impreſe on his ſhield, the Knight of Fortune, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that all the <hi>Grecian</hi> Court ſhould haue knowledge, becauſe his fame might appeare in the brighter luſter: when they were all ſeriouſly buſied in their ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne feaſting, preſented her Monſter in the ſame place where the Tournament had béene before performed, the report whereof was preſently noyſed through the Cittie, which foorth-with drew thether the Knights in generall, to behold a matter of ſuch importance.</p>
               <p>When the Emperour in perſon was likewiſe come the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he knew it to be the ſame Monſter which hee had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeene in the <hi>Perilous Ile,</hi> when <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther foure Knights were thereby drawne thence, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon calling <hi>Dorina</hi> vnto him, in the hearing of all he thus ſpake to her. Fayre Lady, you ought to conſider, that my Court is now vnfurniſhed of thoſe Knights, that ſcorned to giue place to the greateſt aduenture what ſoeuer, and theſe young Princes may eaſily perriſh in medling with your Monſter: therefore I hold it very requiſite, that the tryall of this caſe be deferred till the arriuall of their Fathers, who are able euery way to aunſwere your deſires.</p>
               <p>The Lady ſomewhat offended with theſe ſpéeches, thus replyed. Full well I perceiue, that the paſſed battell hath
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:14347:66"/>
frozen vp your blood, ſince you ſéeke deferring of thys ſmall aduenture: I pray you let theſe young Knight make proofe of their valour, and vnderſtand withall, that the aduenture is no way dangerous, becauſe they are not to combate with my Monſter, but he ſhall be held to haue finiſhed the ſame, that can mount vpon his backe, and then ſalute you.</p>
               <p>This ſéemed to the Emperor no matter of impoſſibilitie, and therefore hee conſented the ſooner to <hi>Dorinas</hi> requeſt, whereupon the day following, all the young Knights of the Court, as alſo the ſtrangers, (except <hi>Don Roſuell,</hi> who was falne into ſuch debilitie of ſence, as his ſpeeches ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be ſilly and peeuiſh) reſorted to the place appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for tryumphs, and thether came likewiſe all the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, who mounting vppon the Scaffolds, made readie to entertaine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, bringing with them <hi>Auriana,</hi> whoſe beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie glittered like a bright ſplendant ſtarre.</p>
               <p>The monſter was there already in the fielde, and <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rina</hi> had taken vp her place, to iudge who ſhould accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh the aduenture, and the formoſt man appoynted was <hi>Franardo,</hi> who made his vaunts to be more nimble in lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, then any foure Knights there preſent. After his reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence doone to the Emperour, he prepared himſelfe for the enterpriſe, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming ſo néere the Monſter, as he thought immediatly to be vppon his backe, hee was ſuddainly caſt backward with his héeles ouer his head, of which apparant repulſe he ſeemed ſo aſhamed, as without vſing any words he went quietly foorth of the Liſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Almaroll,</hi> who was brother-like affected to <hi>Franardo,</hi> preſented himſelfe to make tryall of his fortune, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an agill offer to be quickly aloft, the Monſter turning quite ſide-ward from him, gaue the young gallant ſuch a kick with his foote, as he was likewiſe downe, and depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted diſgraced.</p>
               <p>Theſe miſhaps made the young Lordes to thinke with themſelues, that this aduenture would proue of ſome diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie in the finiſhing, and whoſoeuer ſhould haue the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of ending it, muſt out-goe all the reſt in the height of
<pb facs="tcp:14347:67"/>
his good happe. <hi>Trineus</hi> the <hi>Almaigne</hi> Emperour would gladly haue aduentured, but the Emperour <hi>Primaleon,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing more reſpect of his dignitie, by no meanes would yéeld that he ſhould attempt it. <hi>Armindo</hi> was ſo forward to get vpon the Monſter, that he was caſt quite ouer on the other ſide, as though hee had neuer come neere the beaſt at all, which he tooke in no meane ſcorne I warrant yee. <hi>Orino</hi> performed his attempt in ſuch ſort, and béeing ſmitten by the Monſter vpon the breaſt, he fell downe very ſtrangely amazed and giddied.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gorgoneo</hi> King of <hi>Romata,</hi> deſirous to eſſay what luck he ſhould haue, procéeded in his attempt quite contrary to the former aduenturers: but the Monſter catching faſt hold on his legge, caſt him with his head ſo rudely againſt the ground, that he lay ſtill in a traunce for a great while, and ſo was carried forth of the Liſts. <hi>Fortenbracio</hi> would néedes be the next after <hi>Gorgoneo,</hi> but hee was ſo ſlightlie caſt off by the Monſter, as though it made him bluſh, yet euery one laughed a good at the conceite. <hi>Leonato,</hi> ſeeing <hi>Arguto</hi> preparing himſelfe, was ſo haſtie to be before him, that the Monſter made a ſhewe as if hee feared him: but when he drew neere him, and the young Knight was halfe perſwaded he ſhould end the aduenture, he gaue him ſuch a fall vpon his back, that <hi>Polinarda</hi> his Mother was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at much diſpleaſed, and forſaking the Scaffolde whereon ſhée ſtoode, ſhée went to the very entrance of the Liſts, and there embraced her Sonne in her armes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tamerco</hi> was highly pleaſed at the ſight heereof, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this a happy meanes to compaſſe his intent: for when a man is reſolutely bent to commit an offence, he wil ſerue his owne turne with the very ſlendreſt occaſions. Among the reſt, <hi>Salaman</hi> the <hi>Perſian</hi> had the foyle in his tryall, and gréeued not a little to bee ſo diſgraced. <hi>Caro</hi> and <hi>Belcar</hi> ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtayned the ſame miſhap, and ſo did <hi>Eſtrellant</hi> part without any honour. But <hi>Arguto,</hi> whoſe eye was ſtill fixed on the Knight of Fortune, knowing howe well <hi>Victoria</hi> fauoured him, expreſſing more loue then hee thought conuenient
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:14347:67"/>
ſhould be beſtowed vpon him, eſpecially, where hee iudged himſelfe to be farre more woorthy: departed foorth of the fielde deepely diſcontented, for he ſaue no honour for him to be had by this enterpriſe, but beeing ſo diſ-fauoured by his Miſtreſſe, he thought his ſtay there could no way aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage him: nor did this departure any iote imbaſe him, by reaſon his ſtoute courage was ſufficiently knowne to all, but none coulde truly geſſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe of his leauing the place, neyther did any Knight follow to be inquiſitiue thereof.</p>
               <p>Béeing entred the Citty, he went to the Pallace of <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoll</hi> his Graundfather, and deuiſing what ſignall he might beare whereby to become famous, hee ſawe in a lodging hanging on a wall, the Shield of the Sunne, and hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred it to be the very ſame, which was promiſed him at his enſtaulement in Knighthood, and had crowned with ſo much glory the firſt <hi>Friſoll,</hi> ſo taking downe the Shield, he ſent for an excellent Painter, to flouriſh ouer againe the Sunne with his Penſill, which he either by ſkill or chance ſo well performed, that it appeared as freſh and liuelie as flaming fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arguto</hi> had many matters buſying his braines, what ſucceſſe might befall him on this his ſuddaine enterpriſe, and to kéepe him the more from knowledge of any, he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a fayre Ladies face to be likewiſe painted in his ſhield, with ſome ſigne of diſcontentment in her lookes: then ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and well mounted, he left the Citty, and ſet on toward <hi>Thrace,</hi> where leaue we him to his trauell, till we heare of him againe, in ſuch a ſtrange aduenture as will bring per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill to his life, and that an vnknowne Knight came to aſſiſt him, with whom afterward he goeth to battaile.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tamerco,</hi> hauing made his preparation for the rape of <hi>Polinarda,</hi> a Galley béeing likewiſe readie hard at hand to carry her away: the Knight of Fortune came to make proofe of his ability, and leapt vpon the Monſters backe ſo lightly as he had beene a byrd, where-uppon the Monſter immediatly vaniſhed, becauſe no more ſhould afterward meddle with him: for ſuch was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> qualitie of the enchaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb facs="tcp:14347:68"/>
that any one Knight hauing béene vppon his backe, euery one might then very eaſily performe as much.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Miragarda, Grydonia,</hi> &amp; all the Princeſſes greatly ioyed heereat, but eſpecially <hi>Victoria</hi> was not a little pleaſed, ſo that to ſuch as narrowly noted her behauiour, it plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared how earneſtly ſhee affected the Knight of Fortune. Nowe in the confuſed departure of the people, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour with the Princes were deſcended from the Scaffolds, to accompany his Nephew with ſuch glory to the Cittie, as his happy ſucceſſe had worthily merrited.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tamerco,</hi> ſeeing <hi>Polynarda</hi> withdrawne into a Tent, where her Sonne (by her comforted) had newly left her, went ſuddainly thether with twenty armed Knights, and laying his hand on her mouth, leaſt ſhe ſhould call for help, ripping vp the hinder part of the Tent, they ſtole forth ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, leading along two Damoſels whom they found with her, and them they threatned with death, if they kept not ſilence.</p>
               <p>They had gotten neere the Sea ſide, when a ſeruaunt of <hi>Leonatos,</hi> ſent from him to his mother about ſome buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, ſeeing her and her Damoſells thus violently hurried: cryed out aloude, that his Lady <hi>Polynarda</hi> was carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, which called a number of Knights to reſcue her, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other defence then their ſwords onely, becauſe the tryall of the Monſter was not to be performed in Armour. <hi>Tamerco</hi> oppoſed himſelfe againſt all commers, and firſt hurt <hi>Tarnaes</hi> in the arme, likewiſe <hi>Armindo</hi> in the left hand: but béeing cloſed with <hi>Franardo,</hi> the Knights woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him in two ſeuerall places, ſo without any more reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance he got into the Gallie, hauing <hi>Polinarda</hi> faſt in his arme, and ſetting ſayle, left tenne of his Knights on Land behind him, ſixe of which were quickly bereft of their liues, for <hi>Franardo</hi> and <hi>Almaroll</hi> had recouered certaine huge Maces, where-with they brayned all withſtanders about them, but the other foure yeelded themſelues as priſoners. When <hi>Leonato</hi> heard how his Mother was carried away, he ranne in great haſt with his ſword and ſhield, and béeing
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:14347:68"/>
come to the place, he ſaw the Gallie was put off a good way from the ſhore, and his mother lifting vp her hands deſiring helpe: whereon in a rage he would haue leapt into the ſea to reſcue her, as ſhe made many the like offers for her own deliuerance, but that <hi>Tamerco</hi> with-held her from it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leonato</hi> was ſo immeaſurably outragious, that laying about him without any diſcretion, he ſlew two more of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercos</hi> Knights, and likewiſe had diſpatched the other twaine, but that the Emperor <hi>Trineus,</hi> beeing by this time come thither armed, taking him by the arme, ſaid: Holde your hand my Lord, except you will diſappoynt your ſelfe of meanes, how to follow him that hath borne hence your mother.

Shall not he aſſiſt the Lady in her aduenture, that gaue this Empire to the familie of <hi>Palmerin?</hi> that were an act of great iniuſtice, vnbeſéeming your vertues any way to impeach, or your Sonne (but in a priuate thought) to gaine-ſay.</p>
               <p>Nature and loue (I confeſſe) pleades ſome excuſe for you, but no iuſt meanes of deniall is left for him, becauſe deſire of glory is circumſcribed within no bounds, nor any affection ſhould be preferd before the loue of our Countrey: for howe can that Knight be reckoned truly famous, that dooth not daily oppoſe himſelfe againſt the chiefeſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers? And as he would haue further proceeded, <hi>Miragarda,</hi> perceiuing her folly did but blemiſh her ſonnes deſire of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, kneeled downe and kiſſed her Fathers hand, for the gracious aduiſe he had thus giuen her, and calling <hi>Dorina</hi> to her, ſayd.</p>
               <p>Lady, I vnderſtand that in honour you affect the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of my Sonne, and ſéeke to crowne his head with the wreathes of many high good happs, whereto hee hath no poſſible meanes of attaining, but by the deſperate hazards of his life, and your fauourable regard: let it ſuffice you the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I reſt contented, that you guide him where your arte and deſire ſhall conduct him, and as his fame increaſeth by your furtherance, ſo may your vertues be renowned by his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dorina</hi> humbly falling on her knées, kiſſing her hande, returned this aunſwere: Madame, the deſire I ſometime had to a Knight of this Courte, gouerned then by looſe thoughts &amp; idle diſpoſitions, is long ſince altered to a more chaſte determination of life: ſince when, my fauours haue haue ſhone vpon the Knight of Fortune, whereof he hath found ſome effects, and of ſuch mine arte likewiſe: and as many great aduentures doo eſpecially challenge his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, ſo (to his eternall honour) ſhall hee effect and finiſh them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:14347:69"/>Then ſtepping from her, ſhee went to the Emperour and ſaid. Right high and mighty Lord, my onely requeſt to you, is, that within ſixe houres I may haue the Knight of Fortune hence with me, to vndertake an action that one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtayes his comming: whereto the Emperour cheereful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie replied. Your demaund by no meanes is to be denied, therefore both hee, and his time of departure, remaines at your appointment.</p>
               <p>The Lady hauing kiſſed the Emperours hand, went to the Knight of Fortune, who ſtoode betweene the Empreſſe and his Mother, and the beautifull <hi>Victoria</hi> very néere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, but her eyes full of teares, and hartfull of greefe, hearing that her affected Knight was to depart ſo ſoone, <hi>Dorina</hi> thus ſpake to him. Time fits not now Sir, to ſtand thus idely diſcourſing with theſe Ladies, therefore prepare yee with ſome expedition, becauſe your preſence elſe-where is more néedfull then here, &amp; your horſe and Armour ſtayes ready for you.</p>
               <p>The youthfull gallants thoughts combatting with loue and thirſt of honour, coulde gladly haue wiſht that his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture might two dayes longer be deferred, for further aſſurance of the Infant <hi>Victoriaes</hi> loue, whoſe verie eye la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſhly blabd the true paſſions of her ſoule: but <hi>Dorina</hi> ſtill calling him away, hee had no better excuſe to hide his loth-depart from his Goddeſſe <hi>Victoria,</hi> but onely that there hée would be armed in the Preſence, which was accordinglie performed to his owne deſire.</p>
               <p>After he was armed, hee humbly tooke his leaue of the Emperour, the Empreſſe, his Mother, and the other prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, and comming to the young Infantrie, it happened fayre <hi>Candida</hi> then to be neereſt him, who had ſuch a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine apprehenſion of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> young Knights louely lookes, and vnable to checke the preſent entrance of an amourous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, though to this inſtant ſhée neuer held him worthy anie reſpect, yet nowe her thoughts founde themſelues ſtrangly altered. Hée taking his leaue verie reuerently of her, ſhée ſuddenly loſt her cullour and ſpéech in ſuch manner, as ſhée
<pb facs="tcp:14347:70"/>
was not able to vtter one worde: whereat the Emperour grew ſo diſpleaſed, that he could not imagine what to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue thereof: and but that reaſon reſtrained him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, hee would haue ſtept to her as ſhee ſtoode before the Knight, to haue knowne if his departure were ſo diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to her, as ſhée could not affoorde him a kinde farewell. Ariſing from before <hi>Candida,</hi> he went and kneeled to fayre <hi>Victoria,</hi> béeing both ſtrooken with ſuch an amorous dumbe ſilence, as ſighes were more plentifull then any ſpeech: Onely the young louer ſaid, I am your Knight, and ſhee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, ſo doo I accept you, at which wordes hee gaue her a iewell, which ſhe preſently faſtned in the pleites of her haire. Heere-hence it happened, that betwéene <hi>Candida</hi> and <hi>Victoria</hi> grew a long diſſention, each iniuring other as their apteſt occaſions ſerued.</p>
               <p>The Knight of Fortune, after hee had doone his dutie to the Emperour, and the other Princes there preſent, deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded downe the ſtayres, and béeing mounted on horſebacke, left <hi>Victoriaes</hi> thoughts cumbred with a little iealouſie: for it ſeemed to her a matter diſagréeing with reaſon, that <hi>Dorina,</hi> (who indeede was a woman ſufficient enough to be liked) ſhould fixe her deſire onely vpon her louer, and carry him away with her, whether ſhe pleaſed, but heerin ſhee apparantly expreſſed her ignorance, that ſhe knew not how déerely the Knight affected her, and the firme reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Lady, whoſe affection could not be chained to any man whatſoeuer, ſince ſhée fayled in her choyce election of <hi>Florian,</hi> and loſt the fruite of her hopes in her younger dayes.</p>
               <p>But let vs leaue <hi>Dorina</hi> gone with the Knight, &amp; ſpeake now of <hi>Tamerco</hi> the <hi>Indian</hi> King, who ſayling in the high Seas with <hi>Polynarda,</hi> thought himſelfe happy by his beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull purchaſe, and hauing brought her into his Cabinet, began to embrace and kindly entreate her: but ſhe that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſired death, then to conſent to his vnchaſt deſire, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering her diſtreſſed eſtate, &amp; that violence might wrong her beyond compaſſe of ſufferance, thought better to diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:14347:70"/>
a little with him, then hazard neglectly the vnrecoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable loſſe of honour: whereuppon ſhe vſed theſe ſpeeches vnto him.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I am not to learne, that miſery is made much worſe by crueltie, and ſad greefe doubled by oppoſed extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie: my wretched eſtate the true mappe of the one, your violent will firme inſtance of the other. I coulde ſay, that this courſe of yours is farre vnkingly, &amp; that honour bindes you to better reſpect of a Ladie: but that were for the priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to controule his Kéeper, or the deiected ſlaue to checke his commaunder. Héere am I in your power, deſeruing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be pittied then rigorouſly intreated, and you may gaine that by force<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which otherwiſe you are aſſured to faile of: yet violence to women is no badge of man-hoode, for chaſtities ſpoyle, is tyrannies tryumph. But admit (as men in their oppinion of women are ſoone perſwaded) that time may yeeld hope better ſucceſſe in your ſéeking, and that my minde may be altred from this ſtrict courſe of ſeuerity: I cannot tell, I am no Saint to aſſure aboue mine owne power, nor ſo certaine of my fortune in a caſe ſo deſperate, for as yet my blood is chill with the feare wherein you ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizde me, and my thoughts as diſtracted as at that very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, but vpon further quiet, I ſhall haue more abilitie of my ſelfe, both to iudge of mine owne diſtreſſe, and of anie gentlenes you ſhall beſtow on me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tamerco,</hi> who loued her very earneſtly, was ſo highlie pleaſed with her ſpeeches, that hée grewe halfe perſwaded ere long to compaſſe his loue: wherefore, without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther moleſtation, taking her by the hand, he brought her vp vppon the decke againe, vſing many amourous curteſies vnto her. But the iuſt heauens, neuer permitting violence to that faire body, wherein ſo chaſte a ſoule was encloſed, ſuddainly raiſed ſuch a turbulent tempeſt, as diuers times they were in danger of perriſhing: and <hi>Polynarda,</hi> ſeeing ſo good meanes for preſeruation of her chaſtitie, namely by imminent and ſtill expected death, leſſe gréeuous to endure then <hi>Tamercoes</hi> proſtitution, to whom ſhee could haue no
<pb facs="tcp:14347:71"/>
will to conſent, made this her ioy and onely comfort: for death deſired by any to eſcape a diaſter, is leſſe feare then the extremitie of the others conflict.</p>
               <p>The Gallie drawing neere to the ſhore of <hi>Theſſalie,</hi> at laſt put to ſhore, <hi>Tamerco</hi> béeing not a little glad hee had ſo well eſcaped, though ſome of his men were loſt in the tempeſt, but by the helpe of ſuch as were there with him, he brought <hi>Polinarda</hi> on land vpon a little table, for which the Pagane looking ſhée ſhould be thankfull to him, &amp; find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no returne of gratitude at all, hee fell into ſuch an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious furie, as once he purpoſed there to haue ſlaine her: but conuerting his intent to rauiſh her immediatly, had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen then accompliſhed his wicked deſire, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Knight of the Sunne chaunced to paſſe by at that inſtant, who par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (as you heard before) in ſo deſperate a caſe from <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> and hauing ridden many miles, founde no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture worthy of remembrance, which made him of thys oppinion, that by Land he ſhould light on nothing to make him famous, therefore he would goe try his fortune on the Sea: and ſpying a farre off the ſayle of <hi>Tamerco,</hi> made to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the poynt where hee landed, and came thether at the very time, when <hi>Tamerco</hi> villainouſly would haue deflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Polinarda.</hi> Where albeit he knew her not, becauſe the Sea had much altered her pure complexion, yet he ſcorned that a Knight ſhould ſo abuſe a Ladie, and therefore called to him, but hee who little thought with whom hee was to deale, ſaid: Fooliſh Knight, if thou haſt no better aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage then I ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I will ſuffer thee to arme thy ſelfe, anſwered the Knight of the Sunne: in which while, <hi>Polinarda</hi> beholding either her immediate death or ſhame, in teares thus ſpake. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend mine honour, thou faire-ſéeming Knight, for I am the wofull ſtolne wife to noble <hi>Palmerin</hi> of <hi>England. Arguto</hi> knowing her very well by her voyce, replied: Feare not

déere-eſtéemed Lady, the ſword of iuſtice is come to deliuer you. So diſmounting from his horſe, becauſe <hi>Tamerco</hi> was on foote, a very ſharp battaile began betwéene them, which becauſe it ſéemed doubtfull on either ſide, poſſeſſed the thoughts of <hi>Polinarda</hi> with ſuch feare, that ſtanding in ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpence of her Knights ſucceſſe, ſhee fledde into a wood there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to neere adioyning, vnſeene by either of the Combattants. When <hi>Arguto</hi> had loſt the ſight of the Lady, he feared leaſt <hi>Tamercoes</hi> followers had carried her away, which raiſing a more violent furie in his reſolution, made him reach <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merco</hi> ſuch a cruell ſtroke ouer the temples of his head, as he fell downe amazed to the earth: then mounting on horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe, he fiercely aſſailed <hi>Tamercoes</hi> men, &amp; hauing ſlaine one of them, demaunded who had borne thence the Ladie. Another of them, béeing ſo wounded that hee could not flie, ſhewed which way the Lady had taken: whereupon <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guto</hi> leauing them, gallopped amaine after her, and before he had ridden the ſpace of a mile, hee eſpied her running, with her haire diſheueled about her ſhoulders, &amp; calling to her, ſhée looked back, with ſome ſmall ioy to behold it was he, and not the other that had ſo miſuſed her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arguto,</hi> who conceiued ſome good hope, that by the meanes of <hi>Polinarda,</hi> he might gaine <hi>Victoria</hi> in mariage, very kindly comforted her, promiſing not to forſake her, till hee had brought her backe to <hi>Constantinople.</hi> So taking her vp behind him, rode onward ſo ſpéedily, that <hi>Tamerco,</hi> who had now recouered footing, was out of hope to regaine her by purſuing: beſide, the wound on his head was verie painfull to him, but there hapned an occaſion to hinder theſe diſſeignes, as ſhall be declared in the Chapter fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>

Hée replied, hée had ſéene ſuch a one, &amp; ſhee could not be far gone from them, but he ſaw a Knight likewiſe that offered her defence, and it might be he had carried her away behind him.</p>
               <p>This aunſwere made <hi>Tamerco,</hi> as well knowing that the Giants ſought not after <hi>Polinarda,</hi> but ſome Ladie to them belonging: yet this would ſerue as two reuenges at once, both on the Princeſſe &amp; the Knight her reſcuer, iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it impoſſible for him to eſcape from men of ſuch might. The Giants giuing credite to <hi>Tamercoes</hi> aunſwere, &amp; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the new paſſed footing of the horſe, prepared the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues preſently to follow after, and running with all the ſpéede they could make, they tore downe the trées that ſtoode in their way to let them: and ſuch a noyſe they made all the way they went, that <hi>Arguto</hi> and <hi>Polinarda</hi> heard the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more then a mile off.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Polinarda</hi> would faine haue had <hi>Arguto</hi> put the ſpurres to his horſe, for his better eſcape from ſo great a danger:
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:14347:72"/>
but <hi>Arguto,</hi> who would not flée, if death himſelfe had ſtoode before him, by no meanes coulde be wonne to amend his pace: where-vpon the Giants ſtill following by the track, at length ouer-tooke them, and the youngeſt Giant called to them, that they ſhould ſtay.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arguto,</hi> cauſing <hi>Polinarda</hi> to alight, couering himſelfe with his Shield, ſaid: If any ſparke of true valour doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in yee, then let vs ſingle deale man to man, ſo ſhall your conqueſt of me be the more glorious. Theſe Giants, (who were of the progenie of the Giant <hi>Lurcon,</hi> ſometime reputed a bolde and hardie Knight, and was ſlaine by the Emperour <hi>Primaleon</hi>) hauing well learned all kindes of knightly curteſie, thus forth-with ordained: that the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt, who indéede was the moſt agill and actiue, ſhould firſt try his fortune againſt the Knight of the Sunne, and ſo the combate was agréed vpon betweene them.</p>
               <p>The Giant gaue many vnmercifull blowes, ſuch as had ſurely preuailed euen to the death, but that the Knight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded them by dexteritie and nimblenes, and wounded the Giant in thrée ſeuerall places, though little to any ſound purpoſe, becauſe his Mace brake off their ſpéede in the fall: at laſt, the Knight beeing hardly beſet, and dangerouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie indeede, deliuered ſuch a forcible ſtroke at the Giant, as he cut the Mace in ſunder very neere to his hand, which made him in a rage draw forth his ſword, and nowe began the fight to be fierce and cruell on both ſides.</p>
               <p>The two other Giants ſtanding by, aduiſedly looking vpon <hi>Polinarda,</hi> perceiued that this was not ſhée who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſought, but ſeeing ſhée was of excellent beautie, they became ſo amourouſly affected to her, as they purpoſed to be poſſeſt of her, and ſpeaking in their language to their brother that combatted, to leaue off the fight and follow them, the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Giant diſſemblingly drawing neere her, rapt her vp vnder his arme, the other making the way before him, for ſooner carriage of her to his Caue. The third, that fought with <hi>Arguto,</hi> turning his backe, ranne away with ſuch ſpéede, as the Knight by no meanes could ouer-reach him:
<pb facs="tcp:14347:73"/>
thus ſéeing at one inſtant <hi>Polinarda</hi> borne away, and al the Giants borne quite out of his ſight, himſelfe now ignorant which way he ſhould take, he got vp on horſebacke, riding as he thought the ſame way the Giants had taken, but in leſſe then halfe a myles trauaile, hee had vtterly loſt the tract of their footing, ſo pacing on careleſly till it was night, and yet altogether ignorant whether he went, at laſt hee layd him downe to ſleepe vnder a tree, all woe begon that he could not recouer <hi>Polinarda</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to whom he had (by the ſmall way they rode) imparted his loue, and receiued likewiſe a promiſe from her, to doo her vttermoſt in his behalfe: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, very ſlender fruite was to be expected by her paines, becauſe <hi>Victoria</hi> in her ſoule affected young <hi>Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Knight of the Sunne conceiued ſuch hope by her gentle ſpeeches, as he made certaine account to enioy the Ladie hee loued: a propertie incident <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o louers to deceaue themſelues, by beléeuing aſſuredly the follie of their owne deſires. Thus all that night he fed vppon thoſe perſwaſiue hopes, not hauing any thing elſe to ſatiſ-fie his hungry ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite withall, and in the morning mounted on horſe-back againe, with intent either to finde <hi>Polinarda,</hi> and be her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerer, or end his owne life by the crueltie of the Giants.</p>
               <p>The Giants, after they had brought <hi>Polinarda</hi> to theyr Denne, were each of them ſeuerally ſo enflamed with her loue, as each one would haue her alone to himſelfe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out admitting any fellowſhippe in ſo rich a purchaſe: the elder Giant would haue carried her into the furtheſt nooke of the Caue, there to poſſeſſe the benefit of his laſciuious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, but the other two came running vpon him with their weapons, and there had ſlaine him, but that hee caught vp <hi>Polinarda</hi> in his armes, as a buckler betwéen them. When the two Giants ſaw they could doo nothing againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> third, but that <hi>Polinarda</hi> was ſtill in perrill of her life, they fell to him by handy gripes, charging him to let the Ladie goe, or els they would kill both him and her together: and then the two fell at ſtrife amongſt themſelues, which of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:14347:73"/>
firſt haue her when ſhée was frée from the other, and being both vnarmed, the youngeſt thruſt the other quite thorowe the body, that there he fell downe dead at his foote, and in the ſame furie he ranne the elder in vnder the arme-pit, as minding to kill both him &amp; the woman, becauſe hee ſhould not vaunt of carrying her alone fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him: and this his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe had beene effected, if the Knight of Fortune had not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen then arriued at the Caues mouth, beeing led along that Coaſt by his fauourer <hi>Dorina,</hi> without telling him of anie action there to be performed. Hee hearing the noyſe the Giants made within, and lending his liſtning eare to be further reſolued, heard the dolourous complaints of ſome diſtreſſed woman, which made him ſuddainly diſmount from his horſe, and boldly enter into the Caue.</p>
               <p>The young Giant beholding an armed Knight thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, left the other to deale with him, and then the elder Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant threw <hi>Polinarda</hi> ſo rudely againſt the ground, that hée had almoſt kild her with the falls violence: then drewe hée foorth his ſword to ſuccour his brother, and although they were both vnarmed, yet was their power and puiſſance ſuch, as the Knight had there béene ſlaine betwéene them, if he had not made meanes to get out of the Caue, for there hee coulde not ſo nimbly beſtirre him, but ſtill felt his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſtrokes much to offend him.</p>
               <p>But drawing ſtill backward, like the Lyon in his figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, till he found himſelfe where he had more commoditie of place, by his quicke and agill turnings to euery offered aduauntage, hee made the Giants ſtrokes to be beſtowed but in vaine, and had giuen to them both diuers dangerous wounds.</p>
               <p>The Giants full of furie to be thus ouer-maiſtered by one onely Knight, layd at him like deuils, without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion: but during the fight, ſuch was the Knights ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe in deliuerie of his blowes, as one of them was verie ſore hurte in the breaſt, and the other vnder his right ſide: whereupon the younger Giant thought to haue cloſed with him, but the Knight ranne his ſworde quite thorowe his

               <p>
                  <hi>Dorina,</hi> who had béene inuiſibly preſent all this while, to the end it ſhould not be ſaid, that by the power of her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chauntments the Knight did theſe admirable deeds: made herſelfe to be ſéene, and running into the Caue, founde <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linarda</hi> newly riſen vp, ſitting on a little rock, but greatlie bruiſed with her fal, then putting a certaine ſirrop into her mouth, it very much comforted her. By this time was the Knight himſelfe come thether, who preſently knowing her to be <hi>Polinarda,</hi> he offered to kiſſe her hand: but <hi>Dorina</hi> ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his blood iſſue forth at two or three places, would needes diſarme him, and both they together bound vp his wounds. So there they remained thrée dayes in that place, feeding on ſuch prouiſion as the Giants had there prepared, and the Knight of Fortune grew much perplexed in his minde, not knowing how to conuay <hi>Polinarda</hi> to <hi>Constantinople</hi> again: for his deſires led him to a ſecond ſight of the <hi>Ile of Fortune,</hi> where he was armed Knight, and thether likewiſe <hi>Dorina</hi> intended to guide him, for the perfecting of a very ſtrange aduenture.</p>
               <p>So fetching his horſe, which was tyed by the bridle to a tree when he entred the Caue, and afterward let at liberty to feede till occaſion was to vſe him, they ſet on their iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney: but <hi>Dorina</hi> as yet led them toward <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and as they ſoftly paced on, they met a Knight riding ſo ſadlie, as it ſéemed his thoughts were greatly perplexed, for hys Launce lay quite ouer-thwart before him, &amp; the end there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of gaue <hi>Polinarda</hi> ſuch a puſh on the ſide, as it had almoſt ſet her beſide the horſe.</p>
               <p>The Knight of Fortune offended at ſo vnciuill a parte, caught the horſe by the bridle, &amp; forcing him to ſtand, ſpake in this manner. Diſcourteous Knight, thou muſt make a mends for the iniurie thou haſt doone this Lady: for ſhee (as her iuſt merrite) deſerueth to be honoured, and in my ſight there is no man liuing ſhall wrong her. The Knight, who was <hi>Leonato,</hi> Sonne to the ſame <hi>Polinarda,</hi> béeing angry
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:14347:74"/>
to ſée his horſe ſo helde by the bridle, without regarding what Lady it might be, and ſhée likewiſe ignorant of him as yet, by reaſon of his ſtrange habite and Beuer beeing cloſed: gaue the ſpurres to his horſe, returning no aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, but prepared to haue a race with the Knight of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
               <p>They encountred together in ſuch fierce manner, that <hi>Leonato</hi> loſt one of his ſtirrops, and the other founde him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe indifferently well ſhaken: whereat <hi>Polinarda</hi> began to be agréeued, béeing eſpecially mooued with ſome kinde compaſſion toward the ſtrange Knight, for their conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in blood vrged her to this pitty, albeit as yet ſhe knewe no manifeſt reaſon why ſhee ſhoulde reſpect him. The Knights drew theyr ſwordes, and ſo buckled together, in which bickering, the Knight of Fortune wounded <hi>Leonato</hi> on the left arme, whereat <hi>Polinardo</hi> was ſo vehemently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted in minde, as if the hurt had lighted vppon her very hart, and compelled her in teares to cry out aloude after thys manner.</p>
               <p>Forbeare fayre Knights, and kill not one another for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cauſe concerning me, I fréely pardon any iniury what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, rather then to ſee the ruine of ſuch rare vertue. But ſhée could not ſo ſuddenly ſpeake theſe words, as <hi>Leonatoes</hi> ſword lighting vpon <hi>Primaleons</hi> Shield, ſlided downe the ſaddle bowe, and entring where the Armour was ioynted, wounded him a little vpon the thigh: and afterward lend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eare to the voyce, perceiued that it was his mothers ſpeech, wherefore, without any further contention, he caſt his ſworde from him to the grounde, admiring who his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie ſhould be, yet with no ſuch inferiour reſolution, as to yeeld or ſubmit him to any Knight whatſoeuer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leonato</hi> hauing lifted vp his Beuer, embraced and knée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to his mother, who preſently knew him, and lifting vp her handes to heauen, prayſed God that no greater harme had befalne him: and the Knight of Fortune perceiuing it was <hi>Leonato,</hi> caſt from him his ſword likewiſe, and ranne and caught him in his armes, deſiring pardon for his ſo raſh

The next morning they ſate in counſell among themſelues, howe <hi>Polinarda</hi> ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted back to <hi>
                     <hi>Constantinople,</hi> Leonato</hi> affirming, that the Knight of Fortune, was the meeteſt man to doe it, becauſe by his vertue ſhe had beene deliuered: but he whoſe minde was oppoſed to all aduentures what ſoeuer, and deſirous to goe where <hi>Dorina</hi> ſhould conduct him, replyed, that <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nato</hi> had the greateſt reaſon to be her guide, becauſe, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Sonne, meere dutie challenged that intereſt in him.</p>

                  <hi>Leonato,</hi> not knowing well how to gaine-ſay his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers reaſons alleaged, agréed to returne with her to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople:</hi> ſo changing his horſe with the Knight of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and mutually thanking each other for all kindneſſe expreſſed, they parted on their ſeuerall iourneyes. <hi>Leonato</hi> dooing all things hee could beſt deuiſe to pleaſe his Mother, (who trauailed ſtill with feareful and diſtracted thoughts)

by the time hee had ridden about the ſpace of two leagues, happened on a ſmall Foiſt, whereof <hi>Almaroll</hi> was Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, the ſonne to <hi>Almaroll</hi>: who hearing great report of the Iland belonging to <hi>Dorina,</hi> would needes ſaile thether to ſeeke the Knight of Fortune, as deſirous (with him) to vndergoe ſome great enterpriſe, and in regard of the intire affection he bare him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leonato,</hi> riding without his Helmet on, was the eaſier knowne a farre off by <hi>Almaroll,</hi> who was walking vp and downe vpon the ſhoares ſide, and gotten vp at laſt vppon a little riſing bancke, to ſee what occaſion might befall him from the Land, or any accident which might be offered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Sea. The young Giant, not a little glad of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, went &amp; met him with very chéerefull countenance: but when he beheld the Princeſſe <hi>Polinarda,</hi> hee could not be much more iocond then before he was, becauſe all hope was loſt in <hi>Constantinople</hi> of euer ſéeing her againe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Almaroll</hi> made them a banquet ſufficiently, of ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion as he had aboard in his Foiſte, and hauing with foode and ſléepe that night well refreſhed themſelues, the next day they fell in ſome diſcourſing together, <hi>Polynarda</hi> ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly entreating <hi>Almaroll,</hi> that with his veſſell, he would bring her to <hi>Constantinople.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Olinarda</hi> was nowe not a little contented, ſeeing her-ſelfe in ſo faire likely-hood to reuiſite <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> but giddy &amp; vnconſtant Fortune, who will permit no confidence in any worldly bliſſe, of what apparant ſecuritie ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it ſeeme, troubled the Sea with ſuch furious and tempeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous windes, as the Foiſt beeing in no ſafetie if it ſhould ſaile néere the ſhoare, they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to launch out into the height of the Sea, where toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vp &amp; downe, till by a ſtorme of raine the rough windes began to be more calme, they were at laſt carried toward <hi>Turkie,</hi> and farre off they might diſcerne a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Shippe, which mainly made toward them with ful ſpredde ſayles, whereupon they prepared themſelues for the fight, and the Ships béeing ioyned, they encountred together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leonato,</hi> doubting leaſt feare might be hurtfull to his Mother, eſpecially if the Turkes ſhould happen to boorde the Foiſte, leapt into the enemies Shippe, where killing euery one that durſt ſtand againſt him, at laſt he chaunced to meete with the Captaine, who boldly comming forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, there chaunced a very ſharpe conflict betweene them. The Turkes, ſeeing with what valour their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine defended himſelfe, hauing another Captaine in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie among them, they would néedes goe fight with them in the Foiſte: which <hi>Almaroll</hi> perceiuing, came forward to withſtand them, and to kéepe them from entring into his Foiſte, he likewiſe leapt foorth into their Ship.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:14347:76"/>The Captaine that led the way to fight with the Foiſte, doubting leaſt his fellow Captaine ſhould be ſlaine by <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nato,</hi> forſaking his owne Ship, got into the Foiſte, where ſetting ſayle quickly, and the winde aptly ſeruing, they were twentie leagues off from the other in a verie ſhort ſpace. The Marriners beeing but few in number, he me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naced them with preſent death, to tell him of whence their Foiſte was, and what other paſſengers they had aboorde: whereupon, they told him that they were Chriſtians, and that <hi>Polinarda</hi> the Emperour <hi>Primaleons</hi> daughter was there aboord.</p>
               <p>The Knight right glad to meete with ſo great a Ladie, putting off his Helmet, bad one of them goe and comfort the Princeſſe, telling her, that he was <hi>Dragonalte</hi> King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uara,</hi> and in the other ſhippe where <hi>Leonato</hi> and <hi>Almaroll</hi> were, was King <hi>Platir</hi> her brother: they by commiſſion of the Princes that remained at <hi>Tubante,</hi> were ſent to require ayde of the Emperour in fauour of <hi>Blandidon.</hi> The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, doubtfull of euer ſeeing <hi>Constantinople</hi> againe, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioying the long deſired preſence of <hi>Palmerin</hi> her huſband, lifted vp her head at theſe tydings, and taking truce a little with her diſturbed cogitations, came forth to the Knight, who curteouſly taking her by the hand, ſaid.</p>
               <p>Reioyce faire Princeſſe, that from ſuggeſtion of feare, ſo great hope is thus deriued: &amp; miſtruſt not danger of your ſonnes life, for there can no ſuch ſiniſter chaunce happen, but one ſigne or other will diſcloſe him to the King of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonia.</hi> So breaking off conference, they turned back againe to recouer the Shippe, wherein they left <hi>Platir</hi> and <hi>Leonato</hi> fighting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alma<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>oll,</hi> hauing put all the ſlaues and Mariners vnder cuſtodie, becauſe they yeelded themſelues for ſafety of their liues, ſtoode to behold the ſucceſſe of this combate, and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king aduiſedly on the Knight of the Ship, vnder his Creaſt he diſcerned a little golden Croſſe, which giuing him cauſe to thinke he was a Chriſtian, made him ſteppe betwéene the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vſing theſe words. Stay your weapons a little gentle
<pb facs="tcp:14347:77"/>
Knights, and heare me but ſpeake: then turning to the Knight of the Ship, he thus proceeded. Woorthy Sir, I know not whence or what you are, but the Croſſe that I haue eſpied in your Helmet, perſwades me you cannot but be a Chriſtian as we are.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Platir</hi> hearing theſe wordes, and thinking the Giant might be <hi>Franardo,</hi> or <hi>Almaroll,</hi> lifted vp his Beuer, and before he ſpake, they knew him. <hi>Leonato</hi> perceiuing how he had iniured his vnckle, threw his ſword at his féete, and falling on his knée to kiſſe his hand, was ſtaied vp by <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir,</hi> who ſmiling, thus ſpake. I would neuer deſire better proofe of your valour, then in this tryall you haue made on mée: and now I ſée the Empire of <hi>Constantinople</hi> may hope of long continuance, when her young Knights deliuer ſuch aſſurance of theyr man-hood and chiualry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leonato</hi> bluſhed to heare himſelfe ſo praiſed, but retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning then no aunſwere (becauſe gréefe had ſurprized his thoughts for the loſſe of his Mother) at laſt hee demaunded what Knight it was y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> had departed thence with the Foiſt: but when he heard it was <hi>Dragonalte,</hi> he became greatlie comforted, knowing him to be a man of no meane valour. So they ſet ſaile for <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and hauing a proſperous winde for their purpoſe, within two dayes both the Foiſte and they arriued there together, where <hi>Polynarda</hi> béeing gone firſt on lande to paſſe to the Citty, looking backe by chaunce, ſhée ſaw her brother followe after, accompanied with her Sonne and <hi>Almoroll.</hi> You may geſſe that this ſight was very pleaſing to her, eſpecially after ſo many greefes before endured, and béeing entred into the Shyppe againe, till newes of this good hap was carried to the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, ere long they beheld the Empreſſe <hi>Gridonia, Miragar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, Bazilia, Arnalte,</hi> and all the other Princeſſes, riding ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily thether to welcome <hi>Polinarda.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ioy of a Mother for recouerie of his loſt daughter, I doubt not but you can better conceiue then I expreſſe, as alſo the mutuall ioy and embracings betwéene newe met friendes, after ſo ſad and diſaſtrous a ſeperation: all which
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:14347:77"/>
on eyther ſide was effectually performed, nothing wanting that might declare the true feeling of affection, nor no prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes fayling to thoſe Knights for their great deſeruings. By this time was <hi>Polinarda</hi> clad in other abiliments, and ledd onward by the hand of her Mother, exceeding ioyful for her ſo happy recouerie: there met them the Emperour, and thoſe of elder yéeres with him, among whom was olde <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maroll,</hi> whoſe vigour was nowe very ſufficiently reſtored. The Emperour embraced <hi>Platir,</hi> &amp; <hi>Dragonalte</hi> afterward, beeing a King: then folding <hi>Leonato</hi> in his armes, ſaid. I now ſee the fortunate ſucceſſe of our family, ſince the young men doo not degenerate from the ſteps of their Fathers and Grandſires.</p>
               <p>So riding on betwéene <hi>Platir</hi> and <hi>Dragonalte, Sydelia</hi> and <hi>Cardigia</hi> agreed pleaſantly to ieſt with his Highneſſe, and putting themſelues forward, ſo trauerſſed the ſtreete with their luſtie Palfraies, that hee could by no meanes paſſe along: and béeing diſpoſed to hold on their merry be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, quoth one of them. My Lord, if we were armed, there's not one of vs but would challenge ye ſeuerally to the fight, and puniſh yée for vſurping on our prerogatiue. The Emperor ſmiling to ſée the Ladies ſo ſhut vp the way, ſaid: Beleeue mee faire ſoules, Ile kéepe my ſelfe well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough from warring with any of you, when yée declare ſo many ſignes of courage, but tell mee I pray yée, what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue of yours doo we vſurpe vpon?</p>
               <p>The Ladies not willing to aunſwere him by wordes, tooke each of them her huſband by the hand, and one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> welcomming hers with kiſſes, and the other with kinde embraces, declared that their prerogatiue conſiſted in thoſe fauours, from which they were bard before, by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours conuerſing with them. All the company laughed at the Ladies pleaſant diſpoſition, and the Emperour confeſt his errour, in kéeping their huſbands ſo long from them: but ſince the faulte grew through the great loue he bare to his Knights, hee iudged it might be the ſooner pardoned, whereon the Ladies reſigned them to his maieſtie againe,
<pb facs="tcp:14347:78"/>
ſaying, though he had power to commaunde their preſence in the day, yet they hoped to deſire their company at night, whereat ſuch as were maried, laughed hartily, and the maidens bluſhed very modeſtly.</p>
               <p>So breaking wittie ieſt vpon ieſt, they entred the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, <hi>Almaroll</hi> and <hi>Cardigea</hi> then riding with their ſonne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene them, and they founde the tables ready couered in faire <hi>Fleridaes</hi> garden, where they dined with great pompe and royaltie. But when the tables were withdrawne, the Emperour ſate in ſad conference with <hi>Platir</hi> and <hi>Drago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalte,</hi> of all the paſſed accidents at the Citty of <hi>Tubante:</hi> wherein was at large diſcourſed, all matters betwéen the Prince <hi>Florian</hi> and <hi>Targiana,</hi> what ſucceſſe the war had, as alſo the ſudden flight of <hi>Dirdan,</hi> ſuſpected to vſurpe the kingdome of <hi>Niquea:</hi> adding, to fill vp the full compleat honour of their Embaſſie, that all the Knights (by them) acknowledged their duties to his Highneſſe, but more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially <hi>Blandidon,</hi> who fearing leaſt <hi>Tirenna</hi> his baſtard Siſter intended foreſtalling of his dignitie, would labour his mightines by ſome meanes for her ſupporting.</p>
               <p>The Emperour diſcourſing diuerſly on the paſſed wars, was greatly gréeued to looſe ſo good a Knight as <hi>Dirdan,</hi> but much more offended at his giuing this occaſion of freſh ſtrife: neuertheleſſe, not forgetfull any way of <hi>Blandidons</hi> good deſeruings, (to whom in choyſe regard of his Fathers faithfulnes, and ſufficient proofe of his owne vertue, the <hi>Grecian</hi> Empire was ſo much obliged) immediatly he tooke order, that good aſſiſtance ſhould bee ſent him by the ſame Knights.</p>
               <p>And this occaſion very fitly made offer of it ſelfe, for the new created Knights remaining idle at home, and diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at the Knight of Fortunes departure from the Court, he altogether ſéeking honour by ſearch of aduentures, and they (as willing) yet no way imployed: they tooke it as a note of ſhame impoſed vpon them, and reputed themſelues vnworthy of the dignitie they held, hauing no meanes to expreſſe theyr worth of that office, and therfore by ſeuerall
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:14347:78"/>
wayes they diſcloſed their diſcontentments. <hi>Oliuanto,</hi> the ſecond ſonne to <hi>Florendos,</hi> hearing that ayde was to be ſent into <hi>Turkie,</hi> he fell at the Emperours feete, holding his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle <hi>Platir</hi> faſt by the hand, and ſaid. High and mightie Prince, I humbly beſéech you, that you kill me not by too much loue of kéeping mee in your Court, letting my young yéeres looſe the flower of their owne felicitie: for were I poſſeſſed of my Knight-hood, I might ſhare a part of that honourable reputation, which makes my companions ſo famous and glorious: and if they make a full concluſion to all actions of merrite, what ſhall I ſay I was borne for, or iudge of mine owne condition?</p>
               <p>The Emperour ſmiling on <hi>Platir,</hi> who entreated fauour on his Nephewes behalfe, returned <hi>Oliuanto</hi> this aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere: Feare not faire Sonne, time falls out fit to thine owne contentment, goe and performe your watch for Knighthood, and be religiouſly deuout in your prayers, that that ſacred order may be woorthily receiued by you, to the honour of our Chriſtian fayth, and fame of your ſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oliuanto</hi> departed, and béeing in the chappell to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh his vigill, about the midſt of night, hee heard a voyce procéeding fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the high Altar, ſaying: <hi>I make thee Knight of the Lyon, beeing mine owne Armes and Enſigne, &amp; thou heereafter ſhalt be King of Macedon.</hi> This was ſuppoſed to be the ghoſt of <hi>Florendos,</hi> ſometime King of <hi>Lacedemonia,</hi> and Father to the famous <hi>Palmerin d' Oliua.</hi> The voyce was heard of many that were without the Chappell, who ſuddenly entring, founde <hi>Oliuanto</hi> armed, and bearing a Shield, with the figure of a Lyon in it paſſant on his feete. In the morning the Emperor was aduertiſed hereof, who came with great pompe on horſebacke to the Chappell, where a very reuerend Biſhop celebrated the Maſſe: and ſo returning thence to the pallace, they heard that <hi>Leonato</hi> was newly thence departed, vnder the title of the Knight of the Sword, as the old Knight had béen before called that armed him Knight, whereat his Mother was much diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but the Emperour perceiuing that this was the way,
<pb facs="tcp:14347:79"/>
whereby his Court ſhould grow great againe in former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, comforted her thus.</p>

So taking further order for ſending ayde in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Turkie,</hi> made <hi>Oliuanto</hi> expect his employment thether, and within eyght dayes tenne great Ships, with as many Foyſtes were prepared, whereinto entred fifteene thouſand hardie ſpirits, with <hi>Platir, Dragonalte, Oliuanto,</hi> and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maroll</hi> the younger, with his Father: who ſeeing his ſonne of ſo honourable towardlines, would needs beare him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, that he might the better learne by him, with what diſcretion to guide himſelfe in any dangerous battaile.</p>
               <p>The Shyps put off from the ſhoare, but ſcantly with the good liking of <hi>Auriana,</hi> who hauing thus long conuerſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Chriſtian Princeſſes, and learned the miſteries of our fayth, beholding no likelihood of her returne to <hi>India, <hi>Tamerco</hi>
                  </hi> her brother hauing committed ſuch an errour as the rape of <hi>Polinarda,</hi> was the willinger to be baptized, and ſo was preſented at the holy Font, <hi>Platir</hi> and <hi>Miragarda</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſureties. Shée béeing thus become a Chriſtian, ſought how to haue a huſband aunſwerable to her quality, and noting <hi>Oliuanto</hi> with the piercing eye of iudgement, what high and eſpeciall hope was held of him, and how in all fayre parts he reſembled his mother: ſhee grewe verie much enamoured of him, neuer manifeſting her loue but now at his departing: when the young Knight taking his leaue of her, as before he had doone of the other Princeſſes and Infantries, ſeeming very gracious as hee was on his knee before her, the Lady tooke the ſpirit to ſpeake in thys manner. Although I am a ſtranger, yet I may challenge one of this royall aſſembly, whom I may boldly entitle by the name of my Knight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oliuanto,</hi> remembring howe many times <hi>Auriana</hi> had affably eyed him, and ſuſpecting that loue might be the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall reaſon thereof, repented hee had béene ſo ſlacke in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change

of kindneſſe, according as ſuch a beauty in dutie deſerued, wherefore taking her ſoftly by the hand, and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his affection with a ſweet kiſſe, ſaid. There is nothing (faire Lady) by mee more deſired, then to be called the Knight to ſo great a Princeſſe, that all my enterpriſes bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing performed vnder the name of your beauty, might proue the more ſucceſſefull and fortunate. So after he had expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, what loue in time might be equally entertained, hee aroſe with a Diamond in his hand, which ſhee had giuen him as a remembrance of her affection: but becauſe it was now vpon the very inſtant of departing, and <hi>Miragarda</hi> had gathered ſome ſuſpition of this new commenced loue, ſhee pleaſantly brake this ieſt vpon him. Alas Sonne, you muſt firſt make your vertue cleare in Armes, and thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come famous, before you learne the idle offices of loue: of which frumpe <hi>Oliuanto</hi> was ſo aſhamed, as to cut off fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther entrance into ſuch imaginations of him, hee mounted on his horſe, and ſo rode downe with the reſt towards the Shippes.</p>

befall him on the way. So poſting on in haſt, at laſt hee came to the Kingdome of <hi>Macedon,</hi> very neere vnto the Mountaine <hi>Arteferia<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> &amp; muſing ſeriouſly in his thoughts, in what place hee might light on ſome aduenture, which might beſeeme his valour, he ſuddainly heard a great clat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of weapons, and following directly to the place by his eare, he ſawe three Knights combatting with three Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, who had with them twenty armed men beſide, and all they together, had ſet vppon thoſe thrée, and doubtleſſe had there ſlaine them, but that this Giant by ſo good hap chaunced to come thether, who although hee knewe them not, yet ſeeing they were ſo villainouſly intreated, hée ſtept in to aſſiſt them, and drawing his ſword, ſpake thus aloud: Knights be of good courage, for I purpoſe to ayde you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fortenbracio</hi> béeing neereſt him, knewe him by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſe of a Caſtell which hee bare in his Shield, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon ſaid: Welcome is my Lord the woorthy <hi>Franardo</hi>: which words cheered the other to haue ſo good helpe. One of the Giants making at <hi>Franardo</hi> with a great yron mace, was ſo encountred againe by him with his Sword, as hee cut off the Mace in the very midſt, and gaue him a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous wound in the breaſt, whereat the Giant beganne to ſtagger, and not knowing which way to betake himſelfe, made offer of eſcape away: but foure of his Knights ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in to defend him, hee was the willinger to abide by it, where the fight continued very ſharply for more then halfe an howre, and the young Knights, who had fought there foure whole howres together, were growne very wearie, and <hi>Forcino</hi> hurt to his great diſaduantage.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Franardo</hi> béeing freſh and luſtie, when he ſawe the battaile endure ſo long, ſaid within himſelfe: If I doe no greater good then hetherto I haue doone, I may accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie theſe Knights in death. Héereon he buckled to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Giant, and making a larger entrance, where hee had before opened his Cuiraſſe at his firſt hurt, he made ſuch a window in his body, that his hart might be ſeene panting for life. But minding him no more, hee ſmote off the head
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:14347:80"/>
of one of his Knights, &amp; ſmit two other dead to the ground. When the two Giants ſaw their third companion ſlaine, they ſtroue to get behind <hi>Franardo,</hi> and there they had ſlain him ere he could be aware of them, if <hi>Belcar</hi> and <hi>Fortenbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio</hi> had not runne quickly to reſiſt them, for now hee was very narrowly beſet, and had receiued two blowes beſide, which did aſtoniſh him in ſuch ſort, as if <hi>Forcino</hi> had not lightly leapt to him, hee could not chuſe but muſt needes there haue falne.</p>
               <p>But hauing well recouered himſelfe againe, hée looked about him, and ſawe <hi>Fortenbracio</hi> runne another Giant thorow the ſhoulder, and afterwarde cleaue him downe to the left flancke: which made the third, ſeeing both his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions dead, throw downe his ſword and gauntlet on the ground, deſiring truce and mercie at their hands, as in like manner did ſuch of his Knights as were left aliue, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they were afforded grace and fauour.</p>
               <p>The Giant béeing named <hi>Forzato,</hi> humbly embraced <hi>Franardo,</hi> ſaying: Sir Knight, ſo highly hath your vertue pleaſed me, as I meane to leaue a little Caſtell, which I hold in yonder vally (pointing to it with his finger) and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend vpon you to a very ſtrange enchauntment, which I am verily perſwaded will be concluded onely by your va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Franardo</hi> would gladly haue gone vp the Mountaine <hi>Arteferia,</hi> thinking there to make proofe of himſelfe in ſome hardy aduenture, becauſe the place was very famous, by high déedes of great honour there doone by noble <hi>Palme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin</hi>: but hearing now of this other aduenture, by conſent of the other thrée Knights he thus determined, that the Giant ſhould firſt conduct them to his Caſtell, where they meant that their wounds ſhould be reſpectiuely cured, for <hi>Forcino,</hi> ſonne to the King of <hi>Nauara,</hi> (not remembred before in the calender of their names borne in the <hi>Perilous Ile,</hi>) had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued a dangerous hurt in his flancke. Beeing come to the Caſtell, a Siſter to the Giant, who was named <hi>Grando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> hauing heard of the death of the other twaine, and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb facs="tcp:14347:81"/>
leaſt her Brother ſhould likewiſe follow them, was now not a little glad to ſee him returned: and entertaining them very curteouſly, cauſed them to be vnarmed, taking <hi>Forcino</hi> firſt to dreſſe his wound, aſſured them that none of his entrailes were touched. Afterward ſhee dreſſed the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two Knights, but when ſhee came to tooke on <hi>Franar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos</hi> hurts, ſhee felt a worſer wound ſtrike her to the verie hart: for the young gallant, though the ſhape and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his body were as a Giants, yet had hee a very gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and amiable aſpect, and knew withall, ſo well howe to demeane himſelfe, as might incite a ſetled oppinion to grow amorous of him: but himſelfe hauing not as yet made experience of any loue caſes, let ſlip all ſuch occaſions in a dreame as it were.</p>
               <p>The Giant <hi>Forzato,</hi> who beganne to affect <hi>Franardo</hi> in his very ſoule, and grew deſirous of accompanying him to the Emperours Court, left nothing vnattempted that beſt might honour him, and ſhewed himſelfe very ſeruiceable to the thrée other Knights likewiſe, vnderſtanding that they were Princes of very royall diſcent. Eyght dayes were thus ſpent in phiſicke &amp; Surgerie, in which time the young Gianteſſe vſed kinde cherriſhings to <hi>Franardo,</hi> and beeing one day alone with him, ſpake in this manner. I knowe not (Sir Knight) what to conceite of my ſelfe, or howe to take this ſtrange alteration of my thoughts: except it be thus, that Fortune hath béene your conduct to this place, onely to make mee ſo much yours, as I can no longer be mine owne.</p>

                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:14347:81"/>Lady, you are young, and I vnwoorthy yet of the eſtate of marriage, not hauing doone any thing worthy the name of a Knight, as my Father did before he was married.

               <p>The Lady returned to her lodging, gladde of this good fortune, ſince it ſuccéeded no further, and <hi>Franardo</hi> in like manner, whoſe thoughts hammered on the aduenture pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by <hi>Forzato,</hi> ſeeing the Knights were now in ſtate to were ſhortly their Armour, tooke his leaue of them and the Lady: &amp; beeing departed thence, before they had ridden any great diſtance of ground, the Giant began thus. My Lord <hi>Franardo,</hi> the aduenture whereunto I am your guide, is in the Iland of <hi>Carderia,</hi> which the famous King <hi>Polen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos</hi> of <hi>Theſſalie</hi> conquered, to obtaine the faire Princeſſe <hi>Francellina:</hi> but to him remained no more, then what one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſerued for purchaſe of the Lady.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Franardo,</hi> whoſe bolde hope perſwaded him able to finiſh the greateſt aduenture, made no reckoning at all of the

When <hi>Franardo</hi> hearing with what hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie hee mooued the queſtion, returned him this aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere. Sir Knight, (for leſſe you cannot be by your out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance,) this place is called y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iland of <hi>Carderia,</hi> where is ſaid to be a very perrillous enchauntment, and hether came I to make proofe of my courage.</p>
               <p>That ſhall not you doo, replyed the Knight, becauſe I intend my ſelfe to aduenture it firſt. By reaſon (quoth <hi>Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardo</hi>) hee ſhoulde be firſt, that firſt was poſſeſſour of the place. Words, aunſwered the other, ſerue not to try that lawe by, but weapons, and they will quickly diſcide thys controuerſie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:14347:82"/>While thus they parled together, the day grewe out brighter, ſo that they had knowledge of one another, which was as much as nothing, becauſe in diſputation and ſtrife for honour, a priuate Knight reſpects neither King nor Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, whereon (béeing both mounted) they gaue the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rire and met together. <hi>Arguto,</hi> (who was the other new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Knight) beeing ſome-what diſdainfull, failde in the encounter, but <hi>Franardos</hi> Launce met him ſo ſtronglie on the breaſt, as he was tumbled ouer the crupper of his horſe, and had not his Shield béene impenitrable, this encounter had ſlaine him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arguto,</hi> highly diſpleaſed with this bad ſucceſſe, came vpon him quickly with his ſword drawne, and wounded <hi>Franardo</hi> in one of his armes: but hee whéeling about his ouer-long weapon, glided in ſuch ſort downe his Shield, as lighting vpon his pouldrous, it made a little entrance, and ſlightly hurt him. When each of them had felt the waigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſtrokes of his aduerſary, they began to order themſelues with more diſcretion, managing the fight with ſuch regard, as they might the better vndertake the aduenture of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, yet held the battell very long and fearefull, their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes béeing ſo wearie as they coulde ſcarce lift their legges, whereupon they both diſmounted, to make euident proofe which was moſt valorous. And albeit their Squires (well knowing either by their impreſes) vſed ſpéeches ſufficient to haue them giue ouer, alleaging the Emperours deepe diſpleaſure to them, yet would not <hi>Arguto</hi> liſten to any one word, notwithſtanding, hee could not laugh at any great lucke he had in this difference, for but that his Shield was impiercible, hee had gotten little aduantage by this bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, the ſtrokes of <hi>Franardo</hi> were ſo waightie and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.</p>
               <p>While thys fight endured, ſuddainly there appeared a bridge vppon the firme land, and a Knight couered with blacke Armour, hauing the image of death portraied on his Shielde, hee comming vnto them, ſaid.

               <p>No ſooner had the Knight of the Iland fréed himſelfe of <hi>Franardo,</hi> but he preſently returned againe to <hi>Arguto,</hi> and without giuing him any word, ſo griped him in the flanck, that <hi>Arguto</hi> thought his very bowels were falne forth, and hee ſtabd at the Knights Shielde, but did no harme at all, whereon the Knight grypt him vppon the other legge, at which <hi>Arguto</hi> felt ſuch paine, as he imagined that it was quite ſmitten off, and falling downe, was taken vp by the Knight, and carried into the Iland.</p>

As he rode thorowe woods &amp; vnknowne deſerts, he met a wilde Sauage man, holding an angry Beare by the taile, and wraſtling with him ſo violently, that the beaſt féeling himſelfe ouer-mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, did what he could to get frée from him: but when the Sauage man had eſpied the Knight, hee left the Beare, (which ranne away mainely into the thickeſt wood) and came running at him, with a knotted young trée as his weapon.</p>
               <p>The Knight made no regard of encountring this Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, becauſe (as we haue ſaide before) no feare or terrour lodged within his boſome, but experience now taught him, that nimble agilitie was his beſt defence: for the Sauage gaue him ſuch a thruſt with his trée in the flanck, that (his breath failing him) hee fell backward into a ſhallow pit, and the Sauage, (who ſometime had béen a humaine crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and indifferently ſkild in managing a fight,) would
<pb facs="tcp:14347:84"/>
not take him vp in his armes, becauſe béeing naked and vndefenced, the Knight might ſtab or wound him beeing ſo neere him, wherfore lifting vp his tree, he purpoſed to beate out his braines, and indeede had doone it, but that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Knight (awaked from his traunce) recouered footing, and putting by the blowe, reached him ſuch a ſounde ſalutation on the head, that the Sauage reeling heere and there, at the laſt fell flat on his backe.</p>
               <p>Then thought the Knight ſurely to haue ſmitten off his head, but by reaſon the ſtroke fel ſome-what ſhort, the hurt was the leſſe, and the Sauage ſtarting vp, auoyded another blow, that came with much more furie. So by reaſon of the Monſters ſtrength, and the Knights ſkilfull agilitie, the fight continued without inequalitie for a long ſpace, nor could it eaſily be diſcerned, to whether ſide the victory in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined: for the Sauage deliuered ſuch blowes with his tree, that if (by good hap) it had not the ſooner beene cut off in the midſt, the Knight queſtionleſſe had perriſhed. And albeit the Sauage had receiued ſome ſmall hurts, yet expreſſing himſelfe careleſſe of them, hee layde about him with ſuch rage and madnes, as hee would not permit the Knight the very leaſt breathing while.</p>
               <p>This fell out very offenſiue to <hi>Leonato,</hi> and therefore, to end life, or winne victory at an inſtant, he got neere the Sauage, and giuing a full blow at his face, wounded him ſo déepely in the fore-head, that beeing no longer able to ſée the light, becauſe the blood iſſued forth ſo aboundantlie into both his eyes, he ranne about groaping for his way to flie. The Knight of the Sword lifting vp his weapon, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to kill him, heard ſuddainly a voyce call to him from farre off, and to his iudgement it ſeemed to be a womans ſpéech, ſaying: Oh holde thy hand faire Knight, for it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thy dutie to kill.</p>
               <p>Heereupon he ſtept back, imagining this Sauage might be ſome friend of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperor of <hi>Constantinoples</hi> Court, ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunted, and looking a while about, there came to him a Damoſell with a very ſorrowfull countenaunce, but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:14347:84"/>
beautifull and gracious, who beganne to him in this manner. Vnderſtand thou honourable and moſt famous warriour, that this Monſter was the ſonne of the Giant <hi>Seluaggio,</hi> and the comlieſt youth that euer was ſeene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Giants, it was then my fortune (being Neece to the wiſe <hi>Fileſmena</hi>) to become ſo earneſtly enamoured of him, as, finding no other helpe for my cureleſſe malady, I was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrained to mooue loues ſute vnto him: but he, who made regard of any other ſaue me, caſt mee off with ſuch ſcorne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and opprobrious diſdaines, as, not contented alone in ſuch baſe ſort to repulſe mee, gaue out in euery eare howe much I had importunde him.</p>
               <p>Nowe I doubt not (faire Knight) but thou very well knoweſt, that the loue is very vrgent which makes a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man become a ſuppliant to a man, which vnhappy conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on falling to my lot, and I noting his daily frequented lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uries, reproouing him for them with all modeſt demeanor, yet all this returning no benefite to mee: neuer Serpent ſweld with more venim in his bowels, then will a woman ſo extraordinarily iniuried. Wherefore, without any thought of after repentance, I wrought in ſuch manner by mine arte (which is with mee in higheſt perfection) as by one of my Damoſels, I made him to be brought into this Forreſt, where trayning him into a circkle, I neuer cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by my Carracters and iuyce of fatall hearbes, (the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly influence béeing likewiſe very liberall in aſſiſting) that from the ſhape of man I brought him into this forme, but left him ſo much vnderſtanding withall, as hourely to remember how much he had wronged me.</p>
               <p>But for my ſelfe, ſo extreamely was I bent in diſdaine againſt him, as rather then I woulde conſent to let him haue his former ſhape againe, I could haue caſt my ſelfe headlong into the Sea: yet loues paſſion at length appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed this choller, and I became ſo ſad to ſee him in this ougly forme, as no reſt could take hold of me, eſpecially, when by his pittifull geſtures, I noted howe truly penitent he was become.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14347:85"/>Whereuppon, not to throw by all hope of enioying his ſhape again, by arte I framed a great vault or Caue, whoſe depth doth ſtretch vnder the bottome of the Sea, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I encloſed foure Giants, in ſuch ſort, as no mans power can hinder them from turning a wheele, which continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there they muſt keepe going, till ſuch a one chaunce to happen thether, whoſe good fortune ſhall manifeſt appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly vnto him, in what thing conſiſteth the force of the enchauntment, and ſuch a one eaſily ſhall conclude it, but all others elſe remaine there dead. If nowe thy courage ſerue thée to vndertake ſuch a danger, I will be thy guyde thether, for no meanes elſe is left, or can be found, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by this wretched man ſhall euer recouer his former ſhape againe.</p>
               <p>The Knight of the Sword, who made no reckoning of any perrill, offered himſelfe very readily, and riding on the way, before they had paſt halfe a league in the wood, they heard a noyſe of ſwords clattring vpon Armour, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomewhat neerer, they ſaw two Knights fighting very fiercely together, but neither as yet wounded, becauſe each ſtoode vpon his beſt defence, onely to attempt the aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Vaulte, the fame whereof was greatly noyſed through that country. The Lady entreated the Knight to ſtep betwéene them, for they were of the Court of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople:</hi> whereon <hi>Leonato</hi> thruſting in betwéene them, ſaid. My Lords, I dare be ſo bolde as to ſtay your combate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ye are my déere and beſt eſtéemed friends.</p>
               <p>The Knights, who had not their proper deuiſes on theyr Shields, which partly was the cauſe of their quarrell, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly knew noble <hi>Palmerins</hi> Sonne: and each raiſing his Beuer, became better acquainted, the one beeing <hi>Caro</hi> the Prince of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> the other <hi>Eſtrellant,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Durace,</hi> all right ioyfull of méeting in that place, declaring the reaſon why they combatted together, which was for ſupremacie in attempting the aduenture of the vault, which when the Lady heard, ſhe ſaid. Knights, it auailes not who is firſt or ſecond in triall of the caſe, for fortune with valour
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:14347:85"/>
is more neceſſarily required: therefore let vs all ride on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, for my minde perſwades mee that one of you will prooue famous by this aduenture.</p>
               <p>This made the Knights much more deſirous of attay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their iourneyes end, and ryding on a pace, they ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly heard a Knight call to them, who with like enflamed zeale of this great enterpriſe, made haſt to be there as ſoone as they: but by reaſon his Beuer was not cloſed, they had the ſooner knowledge of him, to be <hi>Don Roſuell,</hi> the father of <hi>Eſtrellant,</hi> who though hee was well ſtept into yeeres, could not content himſelfe with the déedes he had done, but béeing in good eſtate of health, and hearing in <hi>Constantinople</hi> the fame of an aduenture called the Vault, would needes goe thether to prooue his vallour.</p>
               <p>The gladnes of this encounter was great on all ſides, eſpecially in <hi>Eſtrellant,</hi> who very dutiouſly expreſſed his loue to his Father, the rather, becauſe it had before paſt in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon opinion, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he would neuer be able to beare armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more. So riding on &amp; diſcourſing kindly together, they came at laſt within hearing the noyſe of the whéele, which was of ſuch a dreadfull nature, as it was able to affright a very bold reſolue: yet failed it of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> power in theſe Knights, who when they receiued their order of Knight-hood, made a full oppoſition of their liues to all perrils whatſoeuer, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially, where honour was to be expected.</p>
               <p>Drawing néerer and neerer vnto the Vault, on the right hand ſide they heard the footing of a horſe, and ſtaying a while to ſée who it was, they beheld a Giant, whoſe Armor reſembled an Aſhe-couller, &amp; the deuiſe of his Shield was a whéele broken in péeces, becauſe hee came with a reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued intent to breake the enchaunted whéele: but when hée beheld the Knights, hee cryed out aloude to them: Let no man to venture a foote before mée, for I am the man that muſt and will breake the Whéele.</p>
               <p>As ſome of them prepared to aunſwer him, <hi>Don Roſuell</hi> who alwaies vſed to beare him company, during the time of both their weake eſtates, knewe him preſently by his
<pb facs="tcp:14347:86"/>
voice, and ſaide: My Lord <hi>Almaroll,</hi> neuer menace them that are your true intire friends. So lifting vp his Helmet, <hi>Almaroll</hi> came &amp; embraced him, and did the like to all the other Knights, then rode they on toward the vault togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And béeing come thether, <hi>Eſtrellant</hi> entreated his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that he would permit him to be the firſt, and without any tarrying to attend his aunſwere, through his ouer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnes in deſire to finiſh the aduenture, before hee came neere it by a ſtones caſt, one of the Giants that turned the whéele, was come forth of the Vault, armed in bright ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning yron, bearing a white Sickle in a blacke Shield, for his deuiſe, and hauing neither Mace nor Sword, but a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry long rope made all of ſinnewes.</p>
               <p>The Knight meruailing at this kinde of fight, gaue his horſe the ſpurres, and ſmote the Giant with his Launce in ſuch ſort vpon the head, as made him ſtagger ſomewhat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazedly: but in his paſſage by, the Giant caſting his corde abroade, by a ſleight bound it ſo faſt about him, as lifting him lightly from beſide his horſe, in his armes thus carried him into the Vault.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Roſuell,</hi> ſéeing his Sonne thus made a priſoner, would needes be the next in triall of his fortune, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Giant in like Armour came forth againſt him, but the couller of his Shield was yellow, and a mountaine turned topſie turuie as his deuiſe, becauſe hee vaunted of ouertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning mountaines. This fierce fellowe held a great hooke in his hand, with foure poynts (Drag-wiſe) bending to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the ſtaffe, and hauing béene ſoundly ſaluted by <hi>Don Roſuells</hi> Launce, that neere hand he was ready to be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, the Giant ſtrooke at him with his hooke, &amp; catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faſt hold vnder one of his ſhoulder plates, drew him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide his horſe euen in the full carrire, and béeing quicklie ſnatcht vp by the Giant, in like ſort was carried into the Vault.</p>
               <p>Theſe accidents were highly diſpleaſing to the reſt, but becauſe a Giant of farre greater ſtature was iſſued foorth, (clad in blacke Armour, a Serpents head in his Shield, of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:14347:86"/>
ruſtie yron couller, &amp; figured in a bloodie field, alſo a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie huge Holbard in his hand) <hi>Almaroll</hi> went againſt him with his ſword drawne, becauſe hee had no Launce at all. Betwéene them continued a fierce fight for halfe an houres ſpace, but with ſome diſaduantage to <hi>Almaroll,</hi> who, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his youth, could not withſtand the others immeaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſtrokes: and therefore when they came to cloſing, <hi>Almaroll</hi> felt himſelfe rapt vp in the Giants ſtrong armes, and (whether he would or no) carryed priſoner to the vault. The ſelfe ſame miſhap befell to <hi>Caro,</hi> albeit he carried him ſelfe very valiantly.</p>
               <p>The Lady, ſtanding aſide with her Sauage Monſter, to behold theſe battailes, wondred that theſe Knights could hold out againſt the Giants the very leaſt moment, for ouer and beſide the enchauntment, whence they receiued an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie power, ſhe had choſen them amongſt the very fierceſt that could be found in <hi>India,</hi> &amp; ſéeing <hi>Leonato</hi> nowe left there alone, ſhée went vnto him with theſe ſpéeches. As for you, Sir Knight, this day I would not haue you to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake thys enterpriſe, not for any doubt I make of your abilitie, but becauſe to morrow morning, two full yeeres will be finiſhed ſince I made this enchauntment: and it wil better agrée both with the time and purpoſe: for incan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations are oftentimes ſooner ouer-come by happineſſe in fortune, then outward ſtrength, or humaine poſſibilitie.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Lady of the Sauage Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, hauing by good reaſons per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded the Knight of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sword to deferre his attempt vntill the day following, and then to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the perrill of the vault: conducted him to a Pallace of hers neere adioyning, where hée was both greatly honoured and curiouſly ſerued. At his entrance into this Pallace, he tooke off his Helmet, and his daintie curld locks ſo ſwéetly adorned his amiable countenaunce, that the Lady waxed wearie of her Monſters preſence, and fearing he was ouer young to hazard the aduenture, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to endure againſt the Giants, began in méere compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be enamoured of him, willing withall, to hinder him from the danger ſhe feared.</p>
               <p>When night was come, ſhée imagining with herſelfe that ſo young and ſweete blood would eaſily be heated, and not deſpiſe the loue of a beautifull Lady, ſuch as ſhée tooke herſelfe to be, and indeed might iuſtly ſo reckon of herſelfe: when ſhee ſaw all ſafe, and euery one in the dead of ſleepe, ſhe went to his Chamber, where waking him with a mild and gentle touch, ſhée thus began. Meruaile not thou faire young blood of chiualrie, that I (made a priſoner to thy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections) thus willingly come as yéelded to thy power: for thy conquering features haue the ſoueraigne priuiledge, to enforce any Nimph or Goddeſſe immortall, yea, though they had abiured loues mighty controulment, to be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured on a man ſo extraordinarie in merrite. Take pitty
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:14347:87"/>
therefore on a diſtreſſed Maiden, who not able to reſiſt ſo vehement a fire, as thy bright eyes burne vp and conſume my ſoule withall, is come thus alone to offer thee her loue.</p>
               <p>As the Knight of the Sword would haue made her aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, the Sauage Monſter that loued the Lady, percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing when ſhe left her chamber, ſoftly followed, and euen as the Lady awaked <hi>Leonato,</hi> and ſate downe by him hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him faſt by the hand, ſuddainly he leapt vpon the bedde, ano there had meanes good enough to haue ſlaine him, but that <hi>Leonato</hi> preſently ſtarted out of the bed, and drawing foorth his ſword, the Sauage kept off with great feare and terrour, as hauing before felt it deerely to his coſt, running backe, and falling downe for ſafetie at his Ladies féete, whereon ſhee entreated the Knight, that hee would not be diſpleaſed at the Monſters furie, but in his knightly pittie to forgiue and forget it.</p>
               <p>At her entreaties, the Knight of the Sword ſtept backe from hurting the Sauage, becauſe alſo vpon his life depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the finiſhing of the Vaults aduenture, which made him the ſooner to ſhewe himſelfe pacified: and to frée himſelfe from the Ladies importunitie, hee roſe and got on his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, which done, he departed forth of the Pallace, laying him downe on a moſſy bancke vnder a trée, where he ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred away the time vntill the mornings riſe, charged with many thoughts and ſuſpitious doubts, that the Lady would performe as much as in her lay, to hinder him from fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing the aduenture, becauſe he had made ſuch light regard of her loue: yet referring all to God, and his owne good fortune, hee determined there to abide and to try the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt.</p>
               <p>The morning no ſooner put on her bright maieſtie, but a ſtranger noyſe was heard then euer before had béene, and the reaſon was, becauſe that day the enchauntment ſhould be ended: alſo the Giants ſawe by manifeſt ſignes, that their liues was to end with the enchauntment, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they turned the wheele with ſuch fury, as the horrible
<pb facs="tcp:14347:88"/>
terror thereof, might be heard more then a hundred miles of. The Knight not a iote diſmaied for all this garboyle, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced on his Helmet, and went ſomewhat neerer to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vaults mouth, where neuer was heard ſuch a terrible noyſe: and thence he ſaw to iſſue forth the fourth Giant, armed all in great broade plates of Maile, which in diuers parts ſhotte out ſharpe piercing poynts of ſteele, but hee had neyther Sword, Shield, nor Launce.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leonato</hi> ſeeing him no better prouided for his owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, was the more cheerefully comforted, but the Giant ſtauking toward him with mightie large ſtepps, and catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faſt hold on him betweene his armes, wrung him ſo hard together, that hee could compaſſe no meanes of hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him with his ſword: and the ſharpe pointed ſteeles vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his coate of Maile, bruſed and rent the Knights Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour in many places, whereby he receiued certaine ſmall wounds.</p>
               <p>Very much ſtroue the Knight to get out of his hold, but béeing euery way diſappointed, he beganne to haue reſpect to himſelfe, leaſt the Giant ſhould get off his Helmet, and giuing him wounds about the head, be ſo vtterly diſappoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of ending the aduenture: wherefore, making meanes to get out his dagger, he perceiued that the Giant was moſt affrayd of his face, and defended it with all the cunning he could deuiſe.</p>
               <p>In this ſtrange kinde of fight, the Knight was ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly afflicted by the pointed ſteeles, that very faintlie he was ready to fall downe, but that the Giant (feareful of the many offers he made with the dagger at his face) for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got himſelfe, and opening his armes, <hi>Leonato</hi> leapt from him, kéeping then the Giant off the length of his Sword: but all this auailed not, for as hee made a full thruſt at his face, thinking aſſuredly that way to conclude this trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome fight, he was ſuddainly caught faſt in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Giants armes againe, and farre worſe oppreſſed then he had béene before. In this miſerable ſtate he knew not what to doe, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to bethinke himſelfe, that in ſome eſpeciall matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:14347:88"/>
the onely ſtrength of the enchauntment, which hee imagined to be the Giants face, becauſe he was feareful of no other part but that: wherefore watching a happy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntage to get vp his Sword, with the poynt he gaue him a ſuddaine ſtab in the mouth, which made the Giant im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly to let him goe, but there-with he got hold of <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natos</hi> Sword, and writhde it with ſuch a violent power, as at laſt he wrung it quite out of his hand.</p>
               <p>Now was the Knight in extreame and pittifull diſtreſſe, not knowing what defence hee ſhould vſe for himſelfe, nor how to keepe out of the Giants armes, whereinto if he got againe, béeing depriued of the helpe that beſt would ſtedde him, vpon the ſharpe ſteeles hee ſhould be cruſht to death. But as good fortune fell out, this prooued the very laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge the Giant had, for béeing thus wounded in the mouth, he was able to holde out no longer in the tryall, but ranne from him with all the haſt he could vſe into the Vault, the Knight following after him, hard at the heeles. Downe they deſcended a very long paire of ſtayres, without ſeeing each other till they came in ſight of the wheele, which ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly gaue thrée turnes with ſuch noyſe &amp; terror, as brake the earth aboue it, and ſo the light of the Sunne might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently be diſcerned, whoſe beames no ſooner ſhone vppon the whéele, but forthwith it ſtood ſtill.</p>
               <p>But the Giants (who were not as yet voyde of their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall helpe, though diſburdened of their labour at the wheele) calling this laſt Giant to them, (who in his flight had let fall <hi>Leonatos</hi> Sword,) prepared altogether againſt him, the formoſt beeing he that had the Holbard, to whom <hi>Leonato</hi> gaue ſuch a ſtroke, as hee let fall the Holbard out of his hand, and the ſtrife betwéene them had quickly béene concluded, but that the Giant with the hooke caught him faſt by the Helmet, and the other with his cord got him faſt by one leg, and ſo together they lifted him vppon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whéele, which then beganne to goe againe, where betweene them and the violent turnes of the wheele hee had periſhed, but that hee ſhewed the admirable fortitude &amp; courage of one of
<pb facs="tcp:14347:89"/>
noble <hi>Palmerins</hi> of-ſpring: and nowe it ſtoode him highly vpon to declare no leſſe, becauſe his life was in ſuch excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding hazard, wherefore, with all the ſtrength hee had, hee flung from them, and ſtoode vpright on his feete vppon the wheele, and ſetting one of his handes firmely againſt the wall, ſtayde it ſo ſtrictly, that the Giants with all theyr might could neuer more mooue it.</p>
               <p>The Giants doubting theyr deaths to be at hand, could gladly haue wiſhed themſelues further off from that place: notwithſtanding, he with the corde ſtill held his hold, and ſo did the other with the hooke in his Helmet: but the Knight with a reuerſſe blow cut the corde in twaine, which made that Giant forſake his hold on the whéele, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the hooke he did ſo belabour, driuing him to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hard and narrowe ſhyfts, that béeing paſt hope of anie longer continuance, when hee ſawe the ſtaffe of his hooke cut in ſunder, he ſtrone yet to outbraue the Knight if hee could, and ſhewed all the vttermoſt he was able to deuiſe: whereto the Knight had likewiſe a very ſpeciall care, and marking all the fetches and ſlights of the Giant, that hee had now got the mangled hooke into his left hand, yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies made his proffers with the right, thought ſurely to giue him ſuch a maime as ſhould cleerely acquite him. But heerein he found himſelfe very much deceiued, for the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant watching his aduantages at euery turne, at laſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed ſo much in his policie, as he caught hold of him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine by one of the branching fangs, and ſo would haue pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>At this very inſtant, came in the Lady with her Sauage Monſter, who be holding what had happened, thus ſpake vnto him. Right woorthy Knight, well maiſt thou vaunt of ending the rareſt aduenture that euer was, if now in the very laſt attempt thou prooue as fortunate: for thou muſt cut the beame whereby the wheele turnes, and fight with ſuch as ſhall hinder thée from it, hauing ſtill an eſpeciall
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:14347:89"/>
care to the Giants, for they will withſtand thée ſo much as in them lyes.</p>
               <p>The Knight of the Sword, to whom no aduenture ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med beyond poſſibilitie, boldly ſtrooke at it to cut it with his weapon, labouring himſelfe excéedingly till he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt out of breath, and yet all his blowes prooued not to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny purpoſe: whereat the Lady laughed hartily, knowing well no Sword was able to enter it, which the Knight per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing, and reſting himſelfe a while, eſpied at laſt the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants Holbard lying vpon the ground, and geſſing it ſerued to ſome purpoſe about the enchauntment, ſuddainly catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it vp in his hands, there-with he preſently cut it in two parts, and forth of it came a new ſtrange kind of Monſter, reſembling a great Eagle crowned, with tallents long and ſtraite, but meruailous piercing, hauing leggs ſo large and long, as her very breaſt reached as high as his helmet, her beake extended the length of ones arme, but faſhioned like a Smithes paire of ſheeres, and her wings appeared like two ſpred ſailes, hauing arrowes in them in ſted of quills, which ſhe vſed to dart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her as ſhe flapt her wings.

               <p>Nowe wexed the Eagle extreamely furious, and the blood did iſſue aboundantly from her, which made her let flie the arrowes from her other wing like haile, and gaue him wounds in diuers parts of his body, which though they were not deepe, yet they much pained him: beſides, ſhe did greatly annoy him with her tallents, for ſhe had torne one ſide of his Cuiraſſe, which made him refraine from hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himſelfe ouer deſperately, leaſt ſhe ſhould get off the reſt of his Armour: notwithſtanding, as ſhe ſtoode thus ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vpon him, with a winding ſtroke about his head, hée cut off one of her leggs, when ſhee leaping from him, and
<pb facs="tcp:14347:90"/>
lighting on the legge, ſeemed to féele the torments of enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing death, yet would ſhe not giue him ouer ſo, but hopping from place to place, bit him ſometimes by the leggs, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles by the armes, albeit the Knight had ſore hurt her in many parts of the body.</p>
               <p>At laſt he got hold of her faſt by the necke, &amp; with méere ſtrength had neere hand ſtifled her, but that by biting his hand ſhe got away from him, when beeing thus releaſt ſhée mounted on the whéele, where ſprinckling both it and the Giants with her bloode, by meanes thereof the whéele be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to turne round againe a little, and the Giants recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red part of their former vigour, according to the nature of the enchauntment, and ſo at one inſtant they all began a freſh to oppoſe themſelues againſt him, though but ſlender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prouided for their owne defence.</p>
               <p>The ſpeede of the Knight in his paſſed actions, made him imagine the aduenture to be almoſt ended, and being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all very much wearied, he grew the more deſirous of a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle eaſe and reſt, which perceiuing he could not as yet wel compaſſe, but that the whéele was ſet on going againe, and the foure Giants prepared a new to aſſaile him, which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted no place of quiet for him, he caſt by his Sword, and taking vp the Holbard againe, began to lay about him in ſuch furious manner, that the Giants, who were no longer ſecured by power of the enchauntment, had many gréeuous wounds giuen them, ſo that hee which before had loſt his hand, fell downe dead at his foote.</p>
               <p>Now ſtoode the whéele ſtill for euer moouing more, and <hi>Leonato</hi> feeling his ſtrength increaſed with very great courage, intended with the Holbard to kill the other Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, leaſt by their former ſlights they ſhould take hold of him againe: but they (not a little wondring at his dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and valour) feigning to ſet all thrée vpon him together, ſuddainly turned theyr backs and ranne out of the Vaulte, which hee perceiuing, &amp; béeing more deſirous to perfect the labour, then to follow after them, went and ſate downe on a ſtone to reſt himſelfe a while, when preſently hee heard
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:14347:90"/>
the whéele broken in péeces, but could not diſcerne by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it was doone. So béeing of good hope, that now hee had not to deale with any other, ſéeing the wheele was thus broken in péeces, the Ladies Sauage Monſter (who coulde not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer the ſhape of man againe, vntill a bone was taken out of his head, which in her former furie ſhee had therein in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed, when ſhee intended to let him liue and die in that monſtrous deformitie) getting néere to the Holbard which <hi>Leonato</hi> had layd by the ſtone whereon he ſate, tooke it vp, and gaue him ſuch blowes there-with, as ſhewed he had forgot how the other had conquered him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leonato,</hi> who for any treaſure deſired not to bee his death, gently bare off his ſtroakes, till féeling his arme much pained by the Holbards waightines, he lifted vp his Sword againſt the Monſters head, with intent to kill him, for indeed he ſuppoſed he had too long forborne him: and entring into like conſideration (as like Champions in ſuch caſes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly vſe to doo) in what part of him the enchaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments force conſiſted, ſaw the Monſter defend no place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him but his head onely, wherefore he laboured to be his death there, &amp; giuing him a glenting blow on the head with his Sword, out fell y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enchaunted bone on the ground. And then was a wonderfull ſight to be ſéene, howe the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage writhing his head about him, beganne to receiue his former manly ſhape: the head and face firſt, next all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther members in their ſeuerall dimenſions, and that with ſuch ſuddaine ſwiftnes and ſpéede, as it was impoſſible for ſence to comprehend, how he became thus deſpoiled of his monſtrous forme.</p>
               <p>Then founde they themſelues all thrée deliuered out of the Vault, the Lady expreſſing her ſelfe highly contented, that her loue had recouered the ſhape of man againe, then by a mighty winde was the whéele brought thether, which as he ſtoode ſtudying how to conuay it to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> hée eſpyed the thrée Giants ſtanding by a Trée, ſo ſore bruſed with the blowes and wounds they had receiued, that they were hardly able to ſtirre themſelues, and fearing he was

now come to kill them out-right, they cryed out to him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: For Gods ſake Sir Knight haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſion on vs, and we will deliuer all your friends and companions ſafe and aliue.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Leonato</hi> ſaw them in ſubiection vnder checke of his Sword, hee aunſwered: I will firſt haue all my priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned freends reſtored me, and next you ſhall promiſe mee, to beare this whéele hence to <hi>Constantinople.</hi> This iniunction ſeemed very hard vnto them, but ſeeing in what deſperate ſtate they ſtoode, eyther to die preſently by the Knights Sword, or of the hurts they had in fight without ſpéedie cure, they made promiſe to fulfill what hee had enioyned them.</p>
               <p>So all of them going to the Pallace together, they were there with very great diligence cured, ſo were the Giants likewiſe, by a Squire of their owne, that was the ſonne to <hi>Ariſdeno,</hi> ſometime the Emperour <hi>Primaleons</hi> Dwarffe. In eyght dayes ſpace they were all well recouered, which made them very iocond and merry: for then they began to talke of nothing elſe, but the aduenture in the Ile of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deria,</hi> the fame whereof was noyſed farre and neere, and that many woorthy Knights of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Court, were there likewiſe detayned as priſoners: ſo they tooke order for carriage of the Whéele thence to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> but there hapned a hinderance, by an accident which ſhall be héereafter declared.</p>

               <p>The Knight of the Sword, who knew him very well to be <hi>Tarnaes</hi> by his faire armes and deuiſe in his Shield, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned aunſwere, that the Knight which had finiſhed the aduenture, would quickly be with him: ſo returning to the Pallace, he put on his Armour, and commaunding two Launces to be brought foorth, ſent one of them to his aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie, and kept the other for himſelfe. Then without vſing any words at all, becauſe he would not be knowne by his voyce, (which at firſt hee ſo diſſembled as no one could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcry him:) they met together in the carriere with ſuch vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, as either looſing their ſtirrops, were glad to catch holde about their horſes neckes, and the beaſts meeting

breaſt to breaſt, tumbled ouer backward with their Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters beſide them, when both of them enraged to be thus diſgraced, lightly leaping on their féete drew foorth theyr Swords, vowing inwardly no peace, till each man was reuenged.</p>
               <p>The blowes fell as thicke as Sommers haile, but by reaſon of eythers nimblenes &amp; good defence, they had not as yet receiued any hurt. <hi>Tarnaes</hi> was more gouerned by furie then diſcréete regard, but <hi>Leonato,</hi> who in all points reſembled his Fathers kinde of combatting, went to work more aduiſedly, which kept his Armour ſtill more ſounde and whole, and made him holde out the freſher and luſtier. Neuertheleſſe, his enemy at laſt gaue him a ſhrewd wound vpon the arme, by reaſon the buckle leathers of his Shield were broken, and ſo he was faine to let it hang before him: but feeling himſelfe hurt, he caſt a thruſt at his aduerſaries Beuer, which breaking a little open, he gaue him a wound full in the forehead.</p>
               <p>Now began the battaile to be much fiercer then before, that the Knights ſtanding by to behold it, thought it the moſt cruelſt fight that euer they had ſéene, making certaine account, that both of them would perriſh ere they gaue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer: yet durſt they not offer to ſtep betwéene them, becauſe they knewe how offenſiuely eyther would take it.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Knight of Fortune, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted with <hi>Dorina,</hi> to ſeeke ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentures in the Ile of <hi>Fortune,</hi> ridde on with her diuers dayes together, vntil at laſt they came to an vncouth coaſt of the Sea, and there <hi>Dorina</hi> (as euer ſhee was wont to doe, when ſhée brought him where any aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was to be attempted) vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed out of ſight, when the Knight looking on the water, to ſée what there was likelieſt to become of him, eſpyed a ſhip a farre off riding at Anker, but yet beheld no perſon in her. Whereupon he called thereto ſo loude as he could, to try if any would make him aunſwere, and hauing called thriſe without any reply, hee beheld two Lyons come vp on the fore-decke of the Ship, and two other on the poope behind, and deſcending into the boate that was faſtned to the Ship, looſed it, and ſet onward to him.</p>
               <p>His Squire began to quake and tremble, when he ſawe the Lyons draw ſo neere his Lord, wherefore he ſaid, Alas Sir, let vs not abide the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of theſe rauenous beaſtes, for doubtleſſe they wil teare vs in péeces. I will not boudge a foote, aunſwered the Knight of Fortune, but ſée the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt end of this aduenture, and conquer theſe Lyons, were they as many more: but I aduiſe thee to goe hide thy ſelfe in yonder wood, and doubt not but I ſhall returne to thee well enough: ſo lacing on his Helmet, he ſtoode looking on the boate, which ioyned cloſe to the ſhoare, and the Lyons without making any motion of aſſailing him, ſtoode verie ſtill and gently.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:14347:95"/>When the Knight noted this, hée imagined that the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons looked he ſhould enter the boate, and they would be his conduct to the Shippe, which made him preſently mount vpon his horſe, whom he could hardly gouerne through his feare of the Lyons: but hauing at laſt got him into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> boate, the Lyons made it returne backe againe, and brought it cloſe vnto the Shippes ſide, where they mounting vp firſt, made ſignes to the Knight that hee ſhoulde come vp after them. He that held himſelfe not meanely fauoured by For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, without any regard what perrill might befall him, mounted vp preſently, when the Lyons immediatly riſing vp on their hindmoſt feete, caught him vp in their clawes, as if they would haue deuoured him, &amp; carried him ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly vnder the hatches, that hee had not the verie leaſt meanes offered how to defend himſelfe, and there leauing him, they returned vp to the decke againe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Primaleon</hi> conſidering with himſelfe, that there might happen ſome matter well worth the noting, went on fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for his way, thorow a darke paſſage, and came at laſt into a faire Cabbin or Chamber, the walls whereof was richly hung round about with cloth of golde, &amp; all the roofe or vpper part, was of Crimoſin ſilke, very curiouſly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broydered with ſiluer Starres, and the Sunne and the Moone therein wrought ſo artificially, as they gaue a ſhy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſplendour to all the Chamber.</p>
               <p>In one part of the roome ſtoode a goodly bed, hung round with purfled curtaines of gold and ſilke, wherto preſuming to aduaunce his ſteppes, and drawing one Curtaine ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what aſide with his hand, he ſaw there lie ſleeping a Lady of ſuch wonderfull beautie, that albeit his loue was deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>Victoria,</hi> yet this faire face ſéemed ſo highly pleaſing to him, as if they both had ſtoode in perſon before him, hée could hardly determine where he ſhould place his election. Standing thus tranſported in his ſences for a long ſpace, he grew ſo deſirous to behold her bright eyes open, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching lightly her ſnowie breaſts with one of his hands, hée made her to ſtart &amp; awaken: but then her heauenly lookes
<pb facs="tcp:14347:96"/>
did ſo mightily preuaile with him, as hardly could hee ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine from that which honour forbad him, till remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring himſelfe, that thether he was brought about ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture of moment, which made him modeſtly refraine: and lending her his hand to helpe her riſe, thus he ſpake to her.</p>
               <p>Beautifull Lady, I wonder as much at your rare per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, as the ſtrangeneſſe of my aduenturing hether: therefore, (ſo pleaſed you) I would gladly know of whence and what you are, and why among Lyons you haue made choyſe of dwelling thus on the Sea? The Lady ſeeming no way diſcontented with his demaund, replyed in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Aduenturous Knight, whoſe vallour hath ledde thée to what others durſt neuer attempt, but when they haue ſeene the Lyons bring the boate to the ſhoare, would cowardlie flie away into the Woods: I account you the onely man, who dreadleſſe of any perrill whatſoeuer in the aduenture, are deſirous to vnderſtand the full nature thereof, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if Fortune be ſo gracious a Miſtreſſe vnto you, you ſhall finiſh the onely aduenture of regard, that euer anie Knight alone accompliſhed.</p>
               <p>Know then faire Knight, that I am the daughter to king <hi>Fryſoll,</hi> who ſometime gouerned the <hi>Morning Ilands,</hi> til age ſetting heauie foote vppon his backe, made him elect a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt of his owne education, whom he had made Lord of the <hi>Flowrie Ile,</hi> and in whom hee repoſed ſpeciall truſt and confidence: to his care and cuſtodie was I and my brother committed, with ſuch allowance of ſubiects homage, and other dignities beſide, as might well ſuffiſe to haue made him very reſpectful of vs. All matters beeing ſo eſtabliſhed, that when death was controuler of the King our Father, my brother ſhould remaine vnder his protection, till ſuch time as by benefite of yéeres hee coulde lay claime to his kingdome, and then hee ſhould haue it honourably reſigned to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Garnides,</hi> (for ſo was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Knight put in truſt called) promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed much more then our dying father could vrge: ſo giuing
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:14347:96"/>
him the Ring and Staffe of Protectorſhip, the King (our Father) cloſed his eyes and died. Nowe was <hi>Garnides</hi> in full poſſeſſion of the gouernment, hauing at his commaund all the Forts, Caſtels, Treaſuries, and euery thing, there wanted nothing but the title royall, and thereto ambitiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie he began to aſpire. My Brother, being the maine ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling blocke in his way, within few dayes hee was bereft of life, and then in all the haſt he would call himſelfe king: but ſéeing things not ſuccéede yet to populare ſatiſ-faction, but that more eyes and tongues went on his procéedings then he willingly would haue: then woulde hee haue mee (ouer-young in yeeres as then) to be his Wife, to ſette a more ſubſtantiall ground on his tirannous vſurpation, yet happily (when time ſerued) to rid the world of me to.</p>
               <p>An Earle named <hi>Bernuccio,</hi> in whoſe Caſtle I was at that time kept by the vſurpers appointment, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he heard that <hi>Garnides</hi> laboured to make himſelfe King, and knew himſelfe ouer-weake to vſe any reſiſtance, he béeing a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailous expert Magitian, thought y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the beſt way to keepe me from the Tyrant: wherefore he brought me hether in this Shyppe, enchaunting héere likewiſe the foure Lyons which conducted you aboard, limitting his Arte to ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, that none ſhould be ſo bold as to come to this ſhip, except his courage ſerued him to vndertake a great aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, vntill which be ended, I cannot be married, and <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuccio,</hi> fearing leaſt <hi>Garnides</hi> (for this) would put him to death, enchaunted himſelfe in his Caſtell in a very ſtrange manner, and he muſt combate with variable ſhapes, that ſhall be his deliuerance.</p>
               <p>At this inſtant (Sir) there remaineth nothing elſe for you to doo, but to fight with thoſe two Lyons on the prowe of the Shyp: nor is there any neceſſity of their death, but onely to binde them faſt, which perhaps will appeare ſo toyleſome a taſke vnto you, as may make you repent the vnderſtanding of the enterpriſe. But that once doone, the other two Lyons will be obedient vnto you, and keepe yée company thorow a Wood which we are to paſſe, and they
<pb facs="tcp:14347:97"/>
will ſtand vs in very great ſted, kéeping vs from being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured of ſtrange wilde beaſts, whereof you ſhall ſee there ſuch aboundance, as els it were impoſſible to eſcape with life.</p>
               <p>The Knight of Fortune, ſtoode with great pleaſure to heare this ſtrange aduenture, and was on fire till he came to try his vallour in it, wherefore, ſéeing the Lady in that ſort to pauſe, he ſaid. Procure (ſwéete Lady) that we may be ſet an ſhoare againe, if I binde the Lyons: for I know not how my ſtrength ſhall preuaile beeing thus on the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Doe (aunſwered the Lady) that which appertaineth to you, and leaue the reſt to my direction.</p>
               <p>Hée hearing this reply, went vpon the decke, and ere he was halfe mounted, the Lyons on the prow beganne to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile him, one of them catching holde with his teeth on his armes, the other graſping his Helmet with his clawes, but <hi>Primaleon</hi> got one of them faſt by the legge, and puld him in ſuch ſort, as he made him tumble ouer backward, and to the other he gaue ſuch a blow with his left hand, as one of his eyes fell out of his head. Yet for all this, when hee would haue ſtept vppon the decke, where hee was to binde the Lyons, one of them caught him faſt by the thigh, and griped him ſo hard, as the Armour which he wore on that part for his defence, was rent in péeces, and the paine of the gripe entred to the very bone: but to auoyde further op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion by theſe beaſts, he caught one of them by the ſhag-hairde maine, and the other by the taile, wherein appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his admirable ſtrength, for lifting them both thus from the ground, he ſtept vp with them vppon the hatches, and there would haue throwne them into the Sea, till remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring himſelfe, that hee was but to binde them, and not to kill them, hee ſtoode there ſtill, holding them faſt in that manner, in deſpight of all the reſiſtance they could vſe, till the Lyon which had loſt his eye, fell downe vpon the deck, and if the Knight had béene prouided of any thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to haue bound him, the fight betwéene them, had then béene concluded, but while he looſed the corde that bounde
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:14347:97"/>
the boate to the Ship, the Lyon recouering himſelfe, made at him againe in farre fiercer manner then before, that hée was glad to ſnatch vp a club which lay on the ſterne of the ſhip, yet therwith he had care how he fought, leaſt he ſhould chaunce to kill them, lamming them both on the backe and ſides with ſuch blowes, as made them keep back from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming néere him, yet had they wounded him on the ſhoulder and on the breaſt, and torne his Armour very ſhrewdlie, which enforced him diuers times to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greater furie againſt them, and many times he could haue caſt them into the ſea, but he onely deſirous to conquer with the leaſt harme, ſo handled the fight, as he got bound the beaſts feete that moſt annoyed him. All which while, the other bit and ſcratcht him in ſuch ſort, as the leathers of his Cuiraſſe was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and he receiued a hurt in the flanck, whereof he made no reckoning at all, but ſéeing he had but that one beaſt to binde, made at him with ſuch extraordinary courage, as the Lyon ſeeing he wanted his companion, became quite out of hart, and ſo he bound his legges with ſuch facilitie, as the Lady admired it very much, albeit at the beginning of the fight ſhe ſhed many teares, as fearing leaſt ſo good a Knight ſhould miſcarry. But now when ſhee ſaw both the Lyons faſt bound, ſhée grew thorowly confident, that there was no enterpriſe (howe dangerous ſoeuer) but by his vertue and vallour it would be accompliſhed: where-vppon ſhee ſaid.</p>
               <p>Truſt mée Sir Knight, you haue gone greatlie beyond mine expectation, becauſe I helde it as a matter moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that it was poſſible for no one man alone to binde theſe two Lyons: but ſince you haue ſo wel therein preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the other two wil be obedient to you. As ſhe ſpake theſe wordes, the other two Lyons came from the poope of the Ship, and falling downe at the féete of the Knight of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, permitted him gentlie to binde them both likewiſe, which pleaſed him not a little to beholde: So returned hée with the Lady into her chamber, where with precious vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guents ſhe dreſſed his wounds.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXXV. How the Ship went to the ſhoare, and how the Knight of Fortune, accompanied with the Lady &amp; the Lyons, departed thence to the aduenture of the Caſtell, and what chaunced vnto them by the way.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He next day following, the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die béeing very deſirous to goe on ſhoare, and perhaps the rather for haſte of her marriage: made certaine Carracters, which the County <hi>Bernuccio</hi> in ſecrete had taught her, whereby the Shyp had power to ſtirre and mooue, when ſuddainly one of the Lions (creeping along to the ſterne) as if he had béene a ſkilfull Marriner, gouernd it very or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, while another of them ſpred the ſaile, and in this ſort they ſailed onward, and came to the ſhoare, when one of the Lyons leaping foorth on land, held faſt in his mouth the Cable that was tied to the Ship: another of them ſhaking off his bands, tooke vp y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lady lightly betwéen his pawes, and in that manner carried her eaſily on Land, then follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed the Knight after, gladde that he had ſo well recouered the ſhoare againe, where taking his horſe out of the boate, he began to looke about him for his Squire, &amp; at laſt eſpied him come forth of the Wood, running toward his Lord ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie iocondly, the rather becauſe he ſaw the Lyons ſo obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, whom now he had the leſſe reaſon to feare, in that hée beheld how gently they were ruled.</p>
               <p>Some little diſcourſe paſſed betwéene <hi>Primaleon</hi> &amp; his Squire, of thoſe occaſions which had befalne him, then mounting on horſebacke, they rode on towards the Earles Caſtell, beeing called <hi>Traſino,</hi> and built in a place of verie
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:14347:98"/>
great ſtrength. There was another noble Countie, who neuer ſhewed any willing obedience to <hi>Garnides,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes continued loyall to his deceaſſed Lord King <hi>Fryſoll,</hi> and was now become ſo poore, by the long and tedious war of the Tyrant againſt him, that oftentimes he determined to flie from thence, and implore aſſiſtance in the Court of <hi>Constantinople.</hi> But as he ſtoode one day looking foorth at a window of his Caſtell, he eſpied the Knight, the Lady, and the two Lyons comming thetherward, wherein hee knew conſiſted ſome great miſterie, eſpecially becauſe for twenty dayes ſpace together before that inſtant, a walking fire had likewiſe gone round about the Caſtell, which witneſſed ſome apparant ſigne of enſuing good ſucceſſe.</p>
               <p>Héere-uppon arming himſelfe, leaſt it might be ſome traine of the Kings to entrap him withall, hee purpoſed to ſée the effect of this meruaile, and going downe to the gate let fall the drawe bridge, whereon the Knight approching with his horſe, and geſſing him to be the Lord of the place, he curteouſly ſaluted, deſiring that hee might haue lodging in the Caſtell, becauſe hee was wounded, and ſome-what ſicklie. The Lord of the Caſtell ſeeing him ſo young, and the Lyons to walke ſo gently by him, ſawe no reaſon why he ſhould be afraid, but guided them into his Caſtell, where after ſome little conference together, &amp; the Knight of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes woundes viewed and bound vp, they ſate downe to meate there prepared for them.</p>
               <p>The Lord of the place, muſing in his minde what La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die that ſhould be, carrying noate of high and honourable diſcent, marking her aduiſedly, eſpyed betwéene her locks of haire a little roſie cullord ſpot, wherwith ſhe was borne, and which was well knowne to all that inhabited the Ile, whereon he knew for certaine, that this was the daughter to his deceaſſed Knig, and Maiſter. The dinner béeing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and all the ſeruaunts commaunded thence, falling humbly on his knée before her, he thus began.</p>
               <p>Gracious Princeſſe <hi>Filena,</hi> your hap and mine I account moſt fortunate, that your firſt arriuall héere ſhould be thus
<pb facs="tcp:14347:99"/>
in my Caſtell, which I haue euer defended againſt the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant <hi>Garnides,</hi> as the true loyall Standard bearer to the King your Father, which yet you may behold diſplaied vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon my Caſtell. I am verily perſwaded, that this Knight hath deliuered you from the enchauntment in the Shippe, and now goes with you to the Caſtell of <hi>Bernuccio,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let me tell you, that you can hardly paſſe thether but by mine aduiſe: for the Tyrant <hi>Garnides,</hi> hauing vnderſtoode by his Soothſayers, that the aduenture once finiſhed at <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuccioes</hi> Caſtell, hee foorth-with ſhall be diſpoſſeſt of the kingdom, hath cauſed to be brought into a Forreſt (through which you muſt paſſe if you goe thether) ſuch aboundance of Lyons, Beares, Tygars, Leopards, Panthers, &amp; other wilde beaſts, as a huge mighty Armie is not able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them, therefore if you would paſſe in ſafetie, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooues you to defend your ſelues with theſe Lyons, as I wil direct you.</p>
               <p>You ſhall méete ſome pretty diſtance hence, with aboue an hundred Lyons, &amp; as many other beaſts, againſt which you haue no other defence, but to make an Armour both for your ſelfe and horſe, all thicke ſette with ſharpe ſteele poynts a handfull long round about, which couering your body, you ſhall paſſe by them ſafely, for when the beaſts feele themſelues hurt, eyther in the mouth or pawe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out daring to endure any other wounds, they will preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with-draw from further offending you.</p>
               <p>This counſell ſeemed ſcant pleaſing to the Knight, for he held it baſe and vile to proceede by pollicie, in any action where vallour farre better beſeemed it: but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering that he could conduct the Lady in no other manner, and her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence muſt needes be had, elſe <hi>Bernuccios</hi> enchauntment was not to be ended, hee gaue order for making him ſuch a kinde of Armour, and in meane while attended the healing of his wounds.</p>
               <p>Within eyght dayes the Armour was finiſhed, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the forme deliuered by the Lord of the Caſtell, and the Knight béeing thus armed, and the Lady and Squire
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:14347:99"/>
alſo after the ſame manner, the Lyons were brought forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with armed to them, who ſéeing that ſtrange kinde of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour vpon them, began to roare with ſuch extremitie and furie, as all the people in the Caſtell were greatlie afraide of them.</p>
               <p>The Lord of the Caſtell ſéeing euery one prepared, was readie himſelfe likewiſe at the ſtaires foote, both he and his horſe armed according to the reſt, and thus rid they on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Forreſt: whereinto they were no ſooner entred, but they preſently beheld infinite numbers of wild beaſts, that without any ſhewe of feare at all, immediatly ſet vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them, &amp; doubtleſſe they could not by any meanes haue eſcaped, but onely through that ſtrange inuented kinde of Armour, which neuertheleſſe grewe yokeſome and burde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous to them, both by the weight and labour of making re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance.</p>
               <p>And albeit the beaſts founde by very good proofe, that their beſt ſafetie conſiſted in kéeping furtheſt off from theſe paſſengers, yet ſuch as had not made this experience, in heate and rage would needes runne vppon them, although they ſawe theyr fellowes ſore wounded, and themſelues to ſpéede no better as faſt as they came.</p>
               <p>The Knight of Fortune hauing his Sworde drawne, layd fiercely about him vpon the wilde beaſts, and the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that attended on them, ſéeing their Maiſter beſtir him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in ſuch ſort, ranne likewiſe vpon the beaſts, but could not teare many of them, by reaſon the Armour they had on was a let to their nimblenes, onely they went ſecure from hurting, &amp; beſides did wound as many as came néere them. So béeing rid of theſe, they rode on very quietly together, and at laſt deſcried ſuch a huge troope of beaſts before them, as they imagined the number to excéede twenty thouſand, which made them doubtfull how to eſcape from all theſe, where-vppon, riding cloſe with the Lorde of the Caſtell, while the Lyons made way for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> among the beaſts, they found themſelues much troubled and tormented by them: for the Lady beeing falne from her horſe among the heard,
<pb facs="tcp:14347:100"/>
thought verily now to be bereft of life, for two Lyons had caught her faſt by the feete, and dragger her along after them vpon the grounde, but the Knight with his waiting Lyons tooke to her in time, for the beaſts had got open the ſight of her Helmet, and had they not come to ayde her at the very inſtant, no meanes was left for her to eſcape with life.</p>
               <p>Now beganne the Knight ſo to beſtirre himſelfe among theſe wilde beaſts, that the Lyons left the Lady, and made directly at him: but ſee a ſtrange accident happening in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and for their great good in this extremitie, for the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſeeing themſelues ſo wounded by the others of theyr owne kinde, they began to be fearefull and timerous one of another, ſo that they refrained to come néere each other, as thinking they receiued no greater harme then fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. By which ſucceſſefull chaunce, they rode on freelie without their diſturbance, yet fought they with diuers Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents by the way, which by reaſon their ſkinns were hard and impiercible, their poynted Armour did them but ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſeruice: and here were they now in moſt danger of all, for when their owne Lyons ſaw that Armour auayled the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not, as it had doone before againſt the other beaſtes, they held backward as fearefull of the Serpents poyſon, and their horſes were ſo affrighted with the fire &amp; ſmoulder, as (doo what they could) they would no further onward.</p>
               <p>This made them more diſmaide then all the reſt had doone, in which deſperate caſe, the Lady (by good hap) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred herſelfe of a Ring, which the Countie <hi>Bernuccio</hi> in former time had giuen her, to ſtedde her in a dangerous and doubtfull extreamitie: no ſooner had ſhee put it vppon her finger, but the Serpents (beeing not naturally bred in that place, but onely brought thether by the force of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chauntment,) came all gently to her hand, and grewe in ſuch ſtrife who ſhould be formoſt, that they fell vpon one an other with wonderfull violence, and had ſo torne each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in peeces, that in very ſhort while not one of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained aliue.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:14347:100"/>This fell out to no meane aduauntage of the Knight, who queſtionleſſe elſe had neuer eſcaped with life, for an hundred as valiant men as himſelfe, were not ſufficient to haue vndertaken this dangerous paſſage.

The Barque put it ſelfe into this Iland, &amp; béeing faſtned to the ſhoare, the Dwarffe (who all this while had béene inuiſible in the Ship) appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in his former likenes, ſaying: Nowe is to be manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted the reaſon of the name that was giuen you, at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant when you receiued your Knight-hood, which though then perhaps you tooke no notice of, yet now vnderſtand it for your further benefite.

               <p>
                  <hi>Oliuanto,</hi> dreadleſſe of any perrill whatſoeuer, which by the hand of man was to be vndertaken, when hée ſawe himſelfe ſo well on Land, and freed from the bluſtering ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards on the Seas, began to climbe vp the bancke, where (the way of paſſage béeing very ſteepie and narrow) before hee could come to the ſight of any houſe, hee was enforced oftentimes to ſit downe and reſt himſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:14347:102"/>Hauing recouered the height of all, he ſaw himſelfe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed with ſo many faire Pallaces, as humane eye had neuer beheld any comparable to them, and the more did he admire them, becauſe he diſcerned no inhabitants in them: yet heard he peoples whiſperings, and ſaw the tract of their footing, euen as in a frequented and populous Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie was to be noted. Beſide, he heard y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knocking at doores, as if ſome were incloſed that would bee at liberty, and was diuers times ſhouldered as he went along, as if the ſtréete had béene full of people to hinder his way, yet could he not ſée any liuing creature.</p>
               <p>Paſſing thus on thorow the very chéefe ſtréete, he came to a ſumptuous Pallace, which ſtoode very ſolitarie to his eye, yet heard he much muttering &amp; whiſpering of people, and ſome that were indifferent plaine to bee vnderſtoode. Standing ſtill awhile to liſten what he could heare, he ſaw the Pallace gate open, before which was a long payre of ſtayres, and a huge Lyon came foorth, as high in ſtature as a great tall Cammell, the beaſt grumming and grinning at the Knight, began to menace him with his pawe. <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanto</hi> remembring the Dwarffes wordes, that the reaſon of his knighted name was now to be manifeſted, imagined that he was to combate with this Lyon, wherefore moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp the ſtepps, and béeing vnſkild in the nature of the enchauntment, neuer ſtayed to try whether the Lyon would aſſaile him or no: but hauing his ſword drawne in his hand, ſtept by the beaſt and entred the gate, where, in the midſt of a goodly Hall hee beheld a bright ſhining Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, with a faire Idoll on the top thereof, holding an engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen labell in his hand, containing this inſcription.
<q>Such as ſeeke honour heere, are ſure of death.</q>
And another whereon was written thus.</p>
               <q>Vertue may conquer mee, but force will faile.</q>
               <p>The Knight, making no account at all of theſe two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, paſſed on further, and ſawe in a high mounted chaire of eſtate a very aged King, who ſeemed as if hee ſate

and ſlept, and the Knight not knowing of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to demaund the qualitie of the place, meant to awake him for further reſolution. But as hee aduaunced his foote vppon the firſt ſtep, ſuddainly ruſhed foorth at a doore ſtanding halfe open by the King, the Lyon, and caught hold of him ſo vnproui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for reſiſtance, that at one thruſt hee ouerthrewe him a long on the grounde, and then walked ouer him twiſe or thriſe, that he thought he ſhould die with the weight of the beaſt: but remembring himſelfe howe cowardly it were to die in that manner, he leapt vp on his feete, &amp; brandiſhing his ſword againſt the Lyon, the beaſt declared no feare at all of him, becauſe hee could not thus preuaile againſt the enchauntment, and out of the Hall al his blowes were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed but in vaine.</p>
               <p>The young Knight ſéeing his ſword thus ſtill to rebound backe, without any offence doone to the Lyon, beganne to grow doubtfull of his fights ſucceſſe, wherefore, ſhifting his ſteps from place to place, to auoyde the gripes and pawes of the beaſt, he gaue backward in ground the value of ſome tenne paces, ſo as he was come iuſt before the doore where the ſtaires deſcended. There aroſe the Lyon vp on his two hindmoſt feete, &amp; with both his pawes gaue him two ſuch blowes on the breaſt, as made him tumble backward about nine or tenne ſtepps, when if the Lyon had followed vpon that aduantage, the ſtrife betweene them had ſoone beene concluded. But the Lyon returned backe againe into the Chamber, and the Knight (béeing in open ayre) recouered freſh vigour, ſeeming to himſelfe ſo freely diſpoſed, as if hee were now but to begin an encounter.</p>
               <p>So entring into the Hall where the aged King ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:14347:103"/>
preuent him, and caſting a full thruſt at his hindmoſt part, the Lyon nimbly turned, and with his taile beate by the blow, without receiuing any danger at all, ſo did he twiſe or thriſe award his ſtrokes, and made all his labour be but beſtowed in vaine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oliuanto,</hi> labouring in his thoughts very buſily, which way he might ſooneſt attaine to wound the Lyon, thought if he could hurt him in the ſide, then hee ſhould eaſily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe the victory, which made him beſtowe his ſtrokes in that manner: but the Lyon perceiuing the Knights intent, was ſo ready in his turnings and windings, that he could by no meanes preuaile in his purpoſe, for one while with his pawes, another while with his teeth &amp; taile hee ſo ouer-laboured the Knight, that he felt himſelfe in great extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, whereupon, he drew backe toward the doore againe, to reſt himſelfe awhile, béeing vnable to giue one ſtroke more he was ſo wearie: but the Lyon, vnwilling he ſhould haue ſo much as a breathing ſpace, ſtoode ouerthwart the doore, ſtill laying mainely at him with his feete and taile, hauing now brought the Knight into ſuch weakenes and debilitie, as it was very doubtfull what ſhould become of him. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, he intended, ſince he muſt needes die there, yet to die valiantly, &amp; caſting a manly thruſt at the beaſtes ſide, he could not ſo well award it, but that thereby he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued a ſmall hurt, which making him ſtagger halfe out of the doore, and the ſworde continuing ſtill within the wound, ſtriking with his foote to get out the weapon, the beaſt threw himſelfe quite out of the doore, whereby he loſt all the power of the enchauntment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oliuanto,</hi> glad that hee had found the wayes to preuaile againſt the Lyon, ſtept forth of the gate, where hée founde himſelfe ſo refreſhed, as if he had not combatted at all with the beaſt, &amp; becauſe he ſaw the night approching on, which hee knewe not how dangerous it might prooue to him, hee went into the Hall againe, and going toward the King, hee found that he remained ſtill faſt a ſléepe, but had lift vp his head, &amp; leaned it vpright, backward to the Chayre wherein
<pb facs="tcp:14347:104"/>
he ſate. <hi>Oliuanto</hi> béeing ignorant howe to interprete thys meruaile, would now needs mount vpon the third ſteppe, when ſuddainly hee was againe aſſailed by the Lyon, who caught him ſo furiouſly by the ſhoulder plate, as the buckles breaking in ſunder, that part was quite diſarmed.</p>
               <p>Euen in this inſtant the ſleeping King awaked, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit his white beard declared him to be very aged, yet ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted he vp ſo lightly and nimbly, and wounded the Knight ſo often with his royall Scepter, as he now thought himſelfe quite loſt for euer, the Lyon one way aſſailing him, and the King another, his caſe was very dangerous and deſperate: at laſt, giuing a full blow at the Kings Scepter, it preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie fell out of his hand, and hee diſtreſſed of further force, with eaſie ſteps departed thence into a chamber adioyning. The Lyon feeling more and more the griefe of his wound, as béeing in the place moſt offenſiue vnto him, went away lamely, and becauſe he had hurt the Knight ſore vpon the ſhoulder diſarmed, it made him reach another ſtroke at him in his departing, which made the Lyon fall downe to the ground, deliuering ſuch a fearefull cry in his fall, that hée made other Lyons that were in the Pallace, roare to him againe: which when the Knight heard, and doubting leaſt he ſhould be newly aſſaulted in that wearie eſtate, he ſtept out againe at the gate, and preſently returned as cheereful as at firſt, yet coulde not put on his Pouldron, which lay there before him.</p>
               <p>As he ſtoode awhile deuiſing with himſelfe what were beſt to be done, he heard his name called by a woman, at which voyce hee ſuddainly ſtarted, becauſe it ſeemed as if ſhe had beene violenced, and paſſing through the Hall, hee ſawe there a goodly Lady, who at firſt ſight hee tooke to be the beautifull <hi>Auriana,</hi> but when hée came a little neerer her, he perceiued his error, and refuſed to accoſt her: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe whoſoeuer loueth a Lady intirely in his hart, is not eaſily carried away with the pleaſing baites of any other new intiſing beautie. The Lady (with very chéerful coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce) tooke him by the hande, and led him into a very

rich Chamber, whereas a ſumptuous table was prepared, and ſitting downe, they feaſted very kindly together. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per beeing ended, he ſawe enter at the doore the aged King with his Scepter in his hand, accompanied likewiſe with a Giant, the King vſing theſe ſpeeches following.</p>
               <p>Knight, well maiſt thou boaſt of thy good fortune, that thou haſt combatted in this houſe in the night time: but if thou dooſt not fulfill whatſoeuer this Lady giues thée coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell in, to morrow morning thou ſhalt looſe thy life by thys Mace, poynting to that which the Giant carried in his hand, and ſo they departed againe.</p>

               <p>Alas Madame, what haue you doone? haue you had no more regard of your honour, but thus to ſhame your father, and ſtaine your owne credite for euer?

Why then you may boldly make this concluſion, that his ſhame and lyfe ſhall end together, and your blame and life depend vpon the king your Fathers ſentence.</p>
               <p>The King (vppon theſe ſpéeches vttered by the Nurſſe) became acquainted not onely with his daughters offence, but likewiſe with the man that had ſo heauily treſpaſſed, which made him enter the Chamber with more then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon rage, and catching her faſt by the haire of the heade, drew her from off the bead along vppon the ground, and ſo would haue ſtrangled her with her owne locks, but that

               <p>This cry brought the Quéene with all ſpéede thether, where hearing the wretched eſtate of her daughter, ſhe fell into ſuch extremitie of paſſion, knowing well how impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable the King her huſband was, and pittying the ſeuere caſtigation he would inflict vpon his daughter, as the verie conceit heereof rent her hart ſtrings in ſunder, and ſo ſhee fell downe, and preſently died.

               <p>The Wizard vnderſtanding the minde of the King, that theſe two Louers were to ſuffer a lingering kind of death, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end they ſhould not endure ſuch implacable torments, went thether with the Meſſenger, where béeing by the King entertained with great honour, and very ſerious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe paſt betweene the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon the matter already reported, the Sorcerers aduiſe was required concerning the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and in his aunſwere replied as followeth.

ſuch diſſimilitude, as the one ſhall euer abhorre the other.

               <p>The King, deſirous to ſée <hi>Rouino</hi> and his daughter in continuall torment, yeelded the more willingly to be thus enchaunted, taking hold of his former promiſe withall, to enioy the benefite of life for ſo long ſpace: and leauing the kingdome to a Nephew of his, the Graund-father to the Princeſſe <hi>Auriana,</hi> came thus into the Caſtel. But by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon this aduenture continued long time, and fewe Knights were ſo hardie as to vndertake it, he would needes haue all the people of the Caſtell enchaunted to in ſuch ſort, that they might ſée and negotiate their affaires among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, yet not to be ſeene or heard of any, but onely by ſoft murmurings and whiſperings: which ſtrange kinde of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible noyſe, made many ſo timerous, as when they were engirt with theſe audible whiſperers, they would preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie turne backe againe, without attempting the aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>The Lady that was daughter to the fore-named King, endued with exquiſite beauty and behauiour, hauing ſeene (for many yeeres together) no other liuing perſon but her aged offended Father, who alwayes vſed threatnings of worſe and worſe extremities to her, and the fierce Lyon, of whom ſhée liued in continuall feare: durſt neuer be ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenturous as to walke about the Caſtell, onely to auoyde the cauſes of her terror, and yet <hi>Rouino,</hi> albeit he was thus tranſ-formed into a Lyon, loued the Lady ſtill exceedingly, offering diuers times to ſport and play with her, but ſhee would flie from him in regard of feare: ſo much to acquaint you with the whole courſe of the hiſtorie, now returne wée to the place where we left before.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14347:107"/>When the Lady had well noted this gallant young Knight, ſeeing him to be of ſuch vertue and admired valour, ſhée grew greatly enamoured of him, hoping by his means to get out of that enchauntment: wherfore, about the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night houre ſhée went to the bed where he ſlept, and laying her hand gently vpon his breaſt, awaked him, and then v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed theſe ſpéeches. I come to doo kinde offices to thee fayre Knight, whoſe good ſtarres haue béene thy guide to ſo high an aduenture, which when thou haſt finiſhed, thy recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence is to enioy me in mariage, being daughter to a king, and onely heire vnto the Crowne of <hi>India.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oliuanto,</hi> who neuer let ſlippe the leaſt minutes ſpace, without continuall remembrance of his beauteous <hi>Auria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> perceiuing this Lady ſo much to reſemble her, grewe halfe perſwaded that it might be ſhée indéede, till viewing her more aduiſedly, and checking his owne error, he thruſt her aſide from him, which ſhée taking very vncurteouſlie, and hardly reſtraining her womanniſh furie, beeing like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe now vpon the inſtant of her tranſ-formation, (becauſe <hi>Rouino</hi> was already become a Giant, &amp; ſhée to alter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in certaine houres after) which happened euen then in this diſcontented moode, for ſhée felt her necke to ſhoote foorth in length, and her parts to change in aunſwerable proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo that ſuddainly ſhée was become a very fierce Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, when without any intermiſſion of time, ſhee leapt vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Knight, and doubtleſſe had ſtaine him, but that by good hap he quickly drew his ſword, wherewith he deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſo many ſtrokes at her, as ſhee was glad to ſhift for her owne ſafetie, without any further damage to the Knight, then immediatly hee armed him, as expecting to be further aſſailed.</p>
               <p>The old King and the Giant came running thether vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this tumult, and finding the Knight armed, the King ſtood and leaned himſelfe againſt the doore, but the Giant entred with his Mace, yet otherwiſe quite diſarmed, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at <hi>Oliuanto</hi> meruailed not a little, but when he came to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labor him with his ſword, he found his body impenetrable,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:14347:107"/>
and himſelfe very ſtrangely beaten with his Mace, becauſe he had not in the beginning well lookt to himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Heereon, growing ſome-what doubtfull of his life, hée leapt forth of the Chamber, to try if in larger compaſſe hee could better reſiſt his enemie: at which inſtant he bagan to imagine in his thoughts, that the Lyon had thus aſſumed the ſhape of a Giant, which made him y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more diligent and reſpectiue, in what part of his body he might ſooneſt attaine to wound him, as not doubting but ſome place or other was to be offended: but the blowes of the Mace ſo ſhowred vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon him, that he needed <hi>Argos</hi> eyes in attendance to auoid them.</p>
               <p>The fight continued betwéene them about two houres, and <hi>Oliuanto</hi> finding his breath to faile him, remembred his former helpe in that caſe, which was, to get foorth at the Hall gate, &amp; then he ſhould be as freſh as euer hee was, whereupon, he laboured thether ſo much as he might: but the Giant perceiuing it, hindered him from it ſo much as poſſibly hee could: neuertheleſſe, <hi>Oliuanto</hi> caſting a full thruſt at the Giants face, by good hap ſore wounded him, which put him in good hope that the aduenture was fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, for the Giant did nothing nowe but ſtand wiping a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his blood, which gaue <hi>Oliuanto</hi> the better meanes to get out of the Hall, where hee felt his courage in ſuch ſort reſtored, that he thought himſelfe able to conquer two Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants.</p>
               <p>Béeing entred the Hall againe, hee met the olde King comming towards him with his Scepter, and the Viper or Serpent with him, which diuers times offered to wind her ſelfe about him, whereby ſhe did endanger him very often, but ſtill the young Knight preuented her valiantly, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the King gaue many maine ſtrokes, yet by his dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie he ſtill ſo auoyded them, that hee coulde not faſten one ſtroke vpon him. The Serpent, notwithſtanding all her ſubtile ſlights, was yet glad to kéepe off from the kéene ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ſword, and one blowe happening to ſtrike the Scepter out of the Kings hand, he preſently vaniſhed: whereupon,
<pb facs="tcp:14347:108"/>
becauſe he would looſe ſo little time as might be, he made at the Serpent very reſolutely: but ſhe leaping vp ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at his Helmet, byting the laces thereof in ſunder, grypt him ſo violently by the throate, as his immediat death was much to be doubted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oliuanto,</hi> ſeeing himſelfe in ſuch extremitie, ſo ſtronglie gryped her about the necke with his hand, that the Viper in humane voyce thus cryed out: Put me to no more paine, for indeede thou canſt not kill me, but if thou giue ouer and let me goe, the aduenture for this time is concluded. By the voyce, <hi>Oliuanto</hi> knew the Serpent was the Lady, that was before ſo enamoured of him, wherefore, pittying her hard fortune, he let her goe: when preſently the King came with the Giant into the Hall, and mounting both vpon the Viper, flew altogether foorth of the window, but the King firſt vſed theſe ſpeeches to him.</p>
               <p>Thinke not (Sir Knight) that thou haſt fully finiſhed with vs, nor that our patience can permit, that <hi>Auriana,</hi> diſcended of our <hi>Indian</hi> blood, ſhall euer be thine, if wee can hinder it. So fled they thence to another enchaunted Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtell, where <hi>Oliuanto</hi> had afterward toyle enough with them, as in his owne hiſtory is more at large declared.</p>
               <p>Great comfort in minde brought theſe words to <hi>Oliuan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> yet hee might hope to enioy <hi>Auriana</hi> at length, though ſome difficulties might long time be his hinderance. Now began the Caſtell to ſhake and tremble, yea, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole Iland likewiſe, as if it woulde haue ſuncke into ſome bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſſe depth, and within leſſe then an howres ſpace, hee might ſée out at the windowes the people of the Ile, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and talking vpon the Market-place, &amp; heare the noyſe of diuers artificers at theyr handy trades, whereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared manifeſtly vnto him, that the enchauntment there was fully ended.</p>
               <p>So deſcending downe the ſtayres, he met the Dwarffe which had béene his conducter thether, who vſing great reuerence to the Knight, guided him backe againe to the Barque, whereinto they were no ſooner entred, but the

Dwarffe vaniſhed as before, and in one night the Barque arriued at the Porte of <hi>Tubante,</hi> among the Chriſtian Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and béeing come on Land, by <hi>Platir</hi> and the Chriſtian Princes he was moſt kindly entertained, and they deſirous to know the reaſon of his abſence all this while, at large he diſcourſed to them the whole aduenture: ſo entred they the Citty together, and then tooke order for the warres pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.</p>

Then told he her, that hee would firſt ſend a defiance to <hi>Garnides,</hi> and when he had ſlaine him, he would make ſuch ſcorne of the Knight of Fortune, (béeing ſo aſſiſted by his varietie of ſhapes) that he (voyde of all hope to finiſh the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture) ſhould depart thence againe with loſſe of his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour:

then would he enioy her quietly in marriage, and ſo come to the abſolute gouernment of the kingdome.</p>
               <p>The Lady, who intirely affected the Knight of Fortune, and was in good hope to poſſeſſe him as her huſband, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled to be well contented with all his ſpéeches, &amp; cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly obtained this ſecrete of him, that whenſoeuer hee ſhould be wounded in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> right eye, he had no further power of tranſ-formation.</p>
               <p>The Knight of Fortune ſtoode calling without the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtell, to haue the gate opened, and entrance admitted, which he vrged with many threatning ſpéeches, and <hi>Bernuccio</hi> craftily intending his death, by ſending him vnarmed to <hi>Garnides,</hi> let him enter the Caſtell: where taking him ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie kindly by the hand, he brought him vp into the Pallace to the Lady, where he was very ioyfull to behold her, but much more was ſhe contented with the ſight of him. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuccio</hi> perceiuing it, grew greatly diſpleaſed there-with, and but that he could not make himſelfe King before <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides</hi> were dead, he would there haue murdered the Knight in the night time.</p>
               <p>But to preuent them of any ſuſpition, hee left the Ladie there with him, where ſhee acquainted him with <hi>Bernuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cios</hi> intent, and what multitudes of ſhapes hee could tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme himſelfe into: the helpe whereof onely conſiſted in wounding him in the right eye, whereby the enchaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would fully be concluded, and no other meanes left of affecting the aduenture, becauſe the Magitian coulde aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume ſo many ſhapes, and was not to be wounded, but in the eye onely.</p>

                  <hi>Bernuccio,</hi> in the meane while cauſed a ſumptuous ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to be prepared, and hauing gathered by his Arte, that the Knight was Nephew to the Emperour of <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> he thereby ſtoode in the greater feare of him: but Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per béeing ended, after much table talke and familiar diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, he ſpake in this maner.

               <p>The Lady, ouer-ſwaied with her owne imaginations, after many ſwéete kiſſes and kinde embracings, departed from him, and the Knight thus left alone, beganne in this manner to chyde with himſelfe. Oh diuine <hi>Victoria,</hi> with what face can I craue pardon of thee for this offence, which indeede dooth merrite no forgiuenes at all? Sentence mee therefore in the ſeueritie of thy iuſtice, deny mee thy loue, and hide from me thy heauenly beautie, which is the ſureſt and readieſt way to my death: for what can I otherwiſe
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:14347:111"/>
iuſtly expect at thy hande, but the rightfull doome &amp; award of death, for this treaſon to thy beautie, &amp; trecherie in mine obliged faith?</p>
               <p>In theſe and ſuch like paſſions hee ſpent the reſt of the night, euen as if his Lady had béene there preſent with him, but when the morning appeared, he aroſe and armed himſelfe, expecting whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the time of his imployment ſhould come: and <hi>Bernuccio</hi> entring the place where hee was, ſaid: Sir Knight, you can neuer attaine the height of thys aduenture, till firſt you haue ſlaine the Tyrant <hi>Garnides,</hi> for he remaining aliue, little ſhall it auaile the Ladie, if you could diſinchaunt this Caſtell: therefore prepare your ſelfe to goe thether, in ſuch ſecrete manner as I will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Primaleon</hi> knowing how the enchauntment was to be ended, thus aunſwered: I had rather firſt conclude thys perrillous enterpriſe, and afterward let mee alone for kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>Garnides. Bernuccio</hi> ſuſpecting by theſe wordes, that the Lady had inſtructed him for his carriage in the aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, grew timorous of his owne ſucceſſe, and willinglie would haue beene rid of his company: wherefore ruſhing forth of the roome, before a man could thinke the very leaſt thought, he was in the broade Court beneath in the ſhape of a Satyre, with two drawne Rapiers in his hand.</p>
               <p>The Knight, not a little ioyfull héereof, becauſe he ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſired to try his fortune in the fight, that hee might ſet free the Lady, enſtall her in her kingdome, &amp; ſo auoyde all further dallying with her: deſcended the ſtaires, and comming againſt the beaſt, he found him to leape ſo lightly heere and there about him, as hee could not deuiſe howe to faſten a blow vppon him, for knightly courage and ſkill in weapon, ſéemed nothing to him, wherefore, all hee coulde doo, was to ſhunne the ſlights and tricks of his ſeueral ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile offers, which ſeemed indeede very meruailous to him. The Satire hauing the aduauntage of his two long Rapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, let flie his thruſts ſo quick at the Sheeld of Fortune, as all the Knight could doo would hardly award them: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon,
<pb facs="tcp:14347:112"/>
hee ſéeing that the fight might thus continue all day, and yet no benefit to him thereby, marking withall, howe the beaſt ſtill defended his face with one of the weapons, with a maine ſtroke he cut one of the Rapiers through the midſt, and ſo it fell out of his hand to the ground: ſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the Satyre beeing now very fearefull of his face, and not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to fight any longer with one weapon, turned his back and fled.</p>
               <p>Soone after he returned in a contrary ſhape, ſéeming a very ſtrange deformed Giant, with a huge broade hande which ſerued him as a Sworde, and a mightie Club in the other, both ſeeming incorporate, as growing naturally out of his body. Hee was all naked, which <hi>Primaleon</hi> ſhamed very much to behold, and thought it ſmall manhood in him, if he ſhould fight with him vpon this aduantage, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made offer of diſarming himſelfe, to the end hee might not be diſparaged by any inequalitie: but the Lady, ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a window aboue to behold the fights ſucceſſe, adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him to the contrary. The Giant ſeemed thereat to be very wroth and angry, &amp; albeit he ſeemed naked, yet was his fleſh ſo hard and impenetrable, as the Knights Sword rebounded ſtill backe againe, as if it had falne on Armour or ſtéele: but <hi>Primaleon</hi> héedfull of the Giants defence, ſtill noted that hee beſt garded the right ſide of his face.</p>
               <p>For more then halfe an howre the fight endured, and the Knight had ſo well awarded the ſtrokes of his enemie, as hee felt very little endamagement by them, wherefore giuing a ſuddaine thruſt very néere his right eye, the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant ſéemed ſo amazed thereat, that <hi>Primaleon</hi> aduantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly running vppon him, forcibly wreſted the Club quite from him: then had he nothing but his broade hand left, to make reſiſtance withall, which hee likewiſe ſtriking at with the Club, thought he had ſmit it quite off, when find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe deceaued, hee gaue a ſnatch at it with his Gauntlet, and pulling it ſtrongly fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the body, founde that he had it faſt in his hand. Now the Giant hauing nothing to defend himſelfe withall, turnd and fled againe, &amp; ſtayed
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:14347:112"/>
not ſo long as one would goe twentie paces, but he heard a doore ſuddainly ruſh open, and ſawe a Collomne therein with an Idoll vppon it, holding a labell with this inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <q>Except thou cast mee downe, thou art but dead.</q>
               <p>Preſently came foorth a huge beaſt like an Elephant, but farre more agill and nimble in ſhew, with ten ſwords by his ſides, which were helde directly out by certaine hands, turning and winding euery way with meruailous facilitie, as if they had naturall vſe and motion, and the beaſts body had certaine bones reſembling ſcales, faſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned after the manner of an Armour. This beaſt went di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers times about the Piller, appearing to be the Gardian thereof, &amp; handled the ſwords euery way with ſuch admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble dexteritie, as <hi>Primaleon</hi> could not deuiſe where beſt to offend him: but remembring his right eye was the place of certaintie, as hee made his ayme thereat, hee foorth-with ſawe two ſwords ſuddainly ſhoote out of his fore-head, and two other out of his temples on each ſide, hauing like agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and motion as the other ſwords had.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding all this, commending himſelfe to God, couragiouſly he went and aſſailed the Monſter, and it was his good hap, that at the very firſt ſtroke hee ſmote off two ſwords, of thoſe which were vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beaſts ſide, which gaue him ſome hope of victory in the end. But yet it ſtoode him on to be very heedfull, otherwiſe by thoſe ſwordes his death was threatned, for ſhould he haue ſtept betwéene the Collomne and the beaſt, both thoſe ſtarting vp, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther making directly at him, it had béene impoſſible for him to haue eſcaped with life: therefore, euer as he came neere the Piller, he felt himſelfe thruſt backe hee knewe not by whom, and when he made at the beaſt, then all the ſwords were oppoſed againſt him: ſo that at one inſtant hée was brought to ſuch diſtreſſe, that he thought the huge Monſter would haue falne vpon him, and ſo haue nailde him to the earth with the ſwords: which to auoyde, and loth to be ſo violently murdred, by vertue of his generous and vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querable
<pb facs="tcp:14347:113"/>
ſpirit, hee threw himſelfe at one leape vppon the necke of the beaſt, and was ſo ſuddenly prepared withall, that with a ſlicing blow hee cut off the ſwordes that ſerued as a defence to his temples, and to his right eye.</p>
               <p>Now began cheerefull comfort to ſeaze vpon his ſoule, which made him ſend ſtab after ſtab directly to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> part, but the beaſt nothing oppreſſed with his burden, turnd the left ſide of his head with mad furie toward him, and there hée ſaw two other ſwords newly ſtarted foorth, which put the Knight to worſe perrill then the other before had doone: nay more, the beaſt began nowe to take the aduantage of his backe, ſo that <hi>Primaleon</hi> was enforced to get away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, leaſt with his fall vppon him, hee ſhould be preſt to death, yet forgot he not ſtill to ayme at his eye, which the beaſt well perceiuing, vſed the more circumſpection.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding, hauing but thrée ſwords now left to make reſiſtance withall, he got néere to the Piller, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his head cloſe to it, put out his hinderpart to be his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, whereon <hi>Primaleon</hi> layd innumerable ſtrokes, but all to no purpoſe: which when hee plainly perceiued, and that he might hold on ſo God knowes how long, yet reape no benefite by all his endeuour, he purpoſed now to hazard life, or winne the victorie, and taking another leape, caſt himſelfe vpon the right ſhoulder of the beaſt, &amp; as hee made an offer to fall that way on the ground, to the end he might ſo get the Knight vnder him, he hapt to turne his head to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him, which opportunitie not neglecting, as being the eſpeciall occaſion he had ſo long ſtriuen for, he ſtabt him in the right eye, and the huge beaſt ſtaggering forward and backward, had falne with the Knight vnder him, but that he gaue a ſudden leape toward the Piller, and ran againſt it ſo mainely with recouering of himſelfe, as hee fell quite ouer backward, where lying in ſome little quandarie for a prettie while, had not the beaſt béene manfully diſpatched before, his life had perriſhed at that inſtant.</p>
               <p>But comming to himſelfe againe, hee went to the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, with intent to hewe it downe in peece, but the Ladie
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:14347:113"/>
cryed to him that hee ſhould forbeare, becauſe the Piller was to be kept whole and ſound: onely hee ſhould bring it into the Pallace, and ſet it on a goodly baſe, where a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand before it had béene ſet by a King of that Iland, who was a meruailous ſkilfull Nigromancer, then would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue out of the place a furious mad dog, whoſe nailes would pierce his Armour as eaſily as woode, and if ouer him hee could get the victory, then the aduenture was fully accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed.</p>
               <p>The Knight without more adoo went ſtraite to the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and taking it vpon his ſhoulder, it ſéemed as if hee had béene loden with a Mountaine: notwithſtanding, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the glorie of ſo great an enterpriſe, hee luſtily aſcended the ſtaires, but before he was halfe way vp, he was met by a man in the likenes of death, who caught hold on the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler behind, and held it ſo ſtrongly, as had hee not béene en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with extraordinarie vallour, hee had béene tumbled o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer backward with it. But becauſe hee would conquer all impediments whatſoeuer, hee layd about him cheerefullie with his ſword, that the fleſhleſſe bones flew all in ſquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders diuers wayes, and beeing ſo ridde of that diſturbance, he went vp the ſtaires, where iuſt at the doore as he would haue entred, he met with a furious dog of wondrous huge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which ſnarled at his legs, tore and rent his armour, and would not let him ſet a foote forward: all this beeing doone to make him let fall the Piller, which when he could not compaſſe, he leapt vpon his ſhoulder and got vpon the Piller, where ſtanding vpon the head of the Image, hee counterpoizde it in ſuch ſort, as himſelfe could hold no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger footing.</p>
               <p>Then ranne he to the baſe where the Collomne ſhould be ſet, where, when all his labour prooued to no purpoſe, the dogge leapt out at a window of the Pallace, and fell downe broken all in péeces. So ſet he vp the Piller, and ſo ended the enchauntment, whereat the Knight receiued ſuch excéeding contentment, as it ſeemed to him that he had endured not trauaile at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14347:114"/>The Lady very ioyfully came running to embrace him, but he (not vnmindfull of the former wrong he had offered his owne Miſtreſſe, repulſed her ſo diſdainfully, that ſhee, who was in hope before to enioy him as her huſband, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to conceiue ſuch hatred againſt him, as her vehement affection toward him, was now quite forgotten, and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to a plotted peece of treaſon, to haue him murdered by the Tyrant <hi>Garnides:</hi> for women loath extreamely, where they loued extraordinarily, eſpecially when no more fruite followes their amourous purpoſes.</p>

But euen in the heate of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:14347:114"/>
there ſuddainly entred the Pallace gate a Damoſell Dwarffe, hauing two men Dwarffes with her that were her Bretheren, and dooing a duteous reuerence to all there preſent, thus ſhee began.</p>
               <p>I (a poore and wretched Lady) doo bring hether no ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of any aduenture to be accompliſhed, but ſéek means to be reuenged on the very ſtrangeſt iniurie, that euer was offered to any Lady. The Knights beholding her to be of moſt admirable beautie, although in ſtature ſo low &amp; little, had the more compaſſion of her cauſe: and <hi>Oliuanto,</hi> béeing the youngeſt Knight of all, made tender of his ſeruice on her behalfe: but his father deliuering a diſcontented coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce thereat, cauſed him to ſit downe againe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned this aunſwere to the Lady. I take it as moſt agrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with reaſon, that my ſelfe, béeing the onely vnfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate man in this aſſembly, ſhould bee your companion in this cauſe, either that wée may both remaine in equall mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery together, or both be fréed at once of ſo inſupportable a burthen.</p>
               <p>The other Knights, who had long noted the diſconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſtate of <hi>Florendos,</hi> thought it ill-beſeeming courtſhip to croſſe and diſſwade him: whereuppon, the Knight arming himſelfe immediatly, tooke leaue of them all, hauing firſt in ſecrete aduiſed <hi>Oliuanto,</hi> to ſette his eye on the admired chiualrie of <hi>Palmerin,</hi> and <hi>Don Florian</hi> his brother, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they had attained to ſuch a height of reputation. The Lady not a litle pleaſed that ſhe had ſuch a Knight of worth in her company, embarqued her ſelfe with him and his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants, and ſayled thence with ſuch ſwiftnes, as in ſhort while, they which ſtayed had loſt the ſight of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And floa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on the billowes of the maine Sea, the Lady imagined in her owne thoughts, that the Knight could not chuſe but be very deſirous, to know whether ſhe intended to conduct him: whereupon, ſitting downe very modeſtly by him, ſhe began to deliuer her minde in this manner.</p>
               <p>Sir Knight, that you may vnderſtand the iniurious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace doone to me, firſt let me tell you, that I am daughter
<pb facs="tcp:14347:115"/>
to a King of <hi>India,</hi> and that part of the country which is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his gouernment, is peopled with none other then Dwarffes, ſuch as we are. Long time did peace liue and floriſh among vs, without any wrong offered to a nation of ſuch weakenes: till another <hi>Indian</hi> King of great ſtature, deſcended (as he vaunts himſelfe to be) from that king <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> which was conquered in battaile by great <hi>Alexander,</hi> hearing ſome fame ſpred abroade of my beautie, made meanes to enioy me in marriage, promiſing to make mee Queene of his Land. The King my Father, diuining be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand what might enſue heereon, and perceiuing more perrill therein, then my ſhallow diſcretion could reach vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, in ſilence ſhewed himſelfe vnwilling of ſuch an alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: yet was hee loth to withſtand what-ſoeuer pleaſed me, becauſe I (as all women are wont to doo) could not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent my ſelfe with one of mine owne condition, but thirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after change, contrarie kinde and noueltie, thought e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery howre a yéere till I was with him.</p>
               <p>Oh how can mens golden promiſes beguile weake wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men? My poore ſelfe, crediting too much his liberall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations, in no place could enioy any quiet of minde, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the match were thorowly concluded: then ſollemnelie hee came (with thirtie of his chéefe attendants) to eſpouſe me, a thing vnlikely in my ſimple opinion, that with ſo fewe people he aymed at vſurpation of a kingdome, which hee ſhadowed with all ſmooth ſemblances that might be, and had continually twentie of them about him, armed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their cuſtome in platted coates of ſhells. The wedding was ſollemnized, and hee ſo full of humanitie and curteſie, that my Father began to repent his former hard co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  </gap>ecture, and thought it a happy and fortunate marriage, no way to be doubted or feared afterward.</p>
               <p>After wee had ſpent ſome two monthes in feaſting and delights, to generall contentment, but eſpeciallie mine, fiue hundred of his people, armed after the ſame manner as the other were, entred my Fathers kingdome, pretending that they came to waite on him home, becauſe ſome diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:14347:115"/>
had hapned among his ſubiects during his abſence, and could hardly be pacified but by his preſence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saboco,</hi> for ſo was this <hi>Indian</hi> King my huſband named, when hee ſaw that he had men ſufficient there to kill vs all, (for I was the talleſt in ſtature in all our Country, beeing a cubit and a halfe in height, and euery one feared me in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of my greatnes) he laboured to haue mee home to his owne kingdome, whether (God knowes) I went with no little willingnes, little ſuſpecting any trecherie towarde me: and this he haſtened with the more ſpéede, becauſe hée had gotten intelligence, that my Father (by theſe armed troupes growne ſuſpitious of his ſonne in law,) had helde conference with a neighbour Nation confining vppon vs, requeſting aſſiſtance if occaſion ſhould vrge it.</p>
               <p>Our departure was celebrated with all poſſible ioy and triumphs, and béeing come to his kingdome, I was recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with exceeding honour, and all maieſticall dignities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſéeming a Quéene. But eyght daies were not fully paſt, till I beheld my huſbands countenaunce ſtrangely chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, which pierced my hart with ſuch inward affliction, that in his lookes I might reade the preſage of my ruine. Within ſome fewe dayes following, I ſitting alone with him in his Chamber, and doubtfull of ſome imminent ill fortune, he ſuddainly caught mee by the haire of the head, and pulling me from my ſeate, after he had ſhaken &amp; tugde me as himſelfe pleaſed, he threw me againſt the grounde, giuing me ſo many ſpurnes with his féete, as the breath was readie to flie out of my body. When hee ſawe mee in ſuch an affrighted &amp; diſtracted eſtate, as hee iudged I durſt not denie what ſoeuer he demaunded, with wordes full of furie and bitter deſpight, he ſpake to me in manner follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iſota,</hi> (for ſo am I called) looke what I enioyne thee, performe vpon thy life, as thou will auoyde worſe torture then I haue yet inflicted on thée. Write to thy Father, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thine accuſtomed courſe of enditing, and tell him thou lyeſt ſickly at the very poynt of death: in regarde whereof
<pb facs="tcp:14347:116"/>
this is thy deſire, that accompanied with thy eyght Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and foure Siſters, he would come and ſée thée before thy death. And becauſe thine owne attending Dwarffe, who (in reſpect of his credite with the King thy father) ſhal carry the Letter, may the better aſſure him by worde of mouth likewiſe, that he ſaw thée very ſick: when thou haſt written and ſealed the Letter, thou ſhalt betake thee to thy bed, feigning and diſſembling extreame ſickneſſe indéed. I perceiuing at what marke <hi>Saboco</hi> made his leuell, though I was ſhrewdly ſhaken, and very ſore with ſtripes, tolde him, that the vnnaturall dealing he had vſed toward mee, might well enough ſuffiſe his vnkind inclination, without making mee the meanes to betray mine owne kinred and Father.</p>
               <p>Then like a mad man, he flew into a more violent fury, excéeding the former crueltie extended to me, and haled me by the hayre along the ground ſo outragiouſly, treading on me, and beating me ſo vnreaſonably, as hee brake diuers vaines in my body and armes: and bringing mee in his armes to a great bay window, proffered to caſt mee head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long out thereat, ſaying: Thus dieſt thou, if thou yéeld not to what I haue enioyned thee. So much preuailed with me the feare of death, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I cryed out to him, ſaying: Deere Lord, ſaue my life, and I will performe what ſoeuer you would haue me.</p>
               <p>Héereuppon, ſetting me on my feete againe, he ſhewed himſelfe to be highly contented, and with a countenaunce pleaſing, and words moſt perſwaſiue, he brought mee pen and incke: then on ſuch a leafe as the <hi>Indians</hi> vſe to write, I ſet downe the purpoſe of what ſoeuer he willed mée: and the Letter beeing cloſed vp, I was conuaied to my bedde, where I needed not to counterfet or diſſemble ſicknes, his rough vſage had brought mee into extreame ſufficiencie, both in bodies debilitie, &amp; affliction of minde. Then bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Dwarffe to me, in whom I repoſed no meane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, I gaue him the Letter, with ſpeeches ſutable to my preſent eſtate and his appointment, deſiring him beſide, to
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:14347:116"/>

               <p>The King my Father, beléeuing the Letter, and the meſſengers teſtimonie that brought the ſame, within ten dayes ſpace was come vnto mee, and finding mee in that weake eſtate, expreſſed a kinde Fathers true ſorrowe for his childe. <hi>Saboco</hi> diſſemblingly entertained him with great honour, till ſo many dayes were out-worne as his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie could allow, in which time, diuers Lords that came in company with my Father, by his direction were returned to theyr owne houſes, (becauſe my Father would attende my death or recouery) and the Lordes fayled not to report theyr royall vſage by <hi>Saboco,</hi> which made euery one free from miſtruſting his trecherous intention.</p>
               <p>When hee ſawe time fitting with his long expectation, he cauſed my Father, with ſixe of my brothers to be layde hold on, and likewiſe my foure ſiſters: but theſe two, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned by me at that inſtant to reſpect themſelues, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to aduertiſe the other, but coulde not compaſſe it, whereupon they fledde with all poſſible ſpéede, not a little gréeued to leaue theyr Father &amp; brethren in a tyrants cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie. <hi>Saboco,</hi> bringing my Father and Bretheren to my beds ſide, with menaces &amp; torments did enforce them, that my Father ſhould write to the chiefeſt in his kingdome, to deliuer the Caſtels of defence, treaſuries, and what ſoeuer elſe him pleaſed, to ſuch as <hi>Saboco</hi> ſhould ſend to demaund them.</p>
               <p>Now, becauſe the <hi>Indians</hi> neuer vſed to contradict anie thing theyr King commaunded, all that the Letter impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, was forthwith performed, and thoſe Princes who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were our confederates, by this meanes remained de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate of theyr owne iuriſdictions. Newes being brought to <hi>Saboco,</hi> that euery thing ſorted to his owne direction, hée brought my Father and his ſixe ſonnes into my Chamber, where before my face he firſt murdered the aged King, and afterward his ſonnes without any compaſſion: then cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing my Siſters to be ſeuerally brought thether likewiſe,
<pb facs="tcp:14347:117"/>
he deflowred them one after another in my fight, and my ſelfe, which had deliuered ſuch a wealthy Kingdome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his hands, he deliuered ouer to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> raſcalitie of his Court, to diſhonour me firſt with abhorred luxurie, and afterward with wilde beaſts to be torne in peeces.</p>
               <p>But heauen beholding my intollerable iniuries, excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the abilitie of any liuing creature to endure, raiſed me vp one friende among ſo many monſtrous inhumaine vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laines, a Gentleman of his Chamber, who ſéeing mée left to violent proſtitution, pittying a Kings daughter ſhoulde be ſo brutiſhly diſgraced, conſidering my beautie pleaded for farre better reſpect, deuiſed this ſhift in hope to doo mée good: that (to auoyde contention who ſhoulde enioy mee) fortune ſhould be deſcided by lotterie, and lots beeing caſt, his was the honour firſt to poſſeſſe me, which hee (crauing that the eye of day might not looke on an act ſo deteſtable) purpoſed to performe me (as he ſaid) the night enſuing: but indeede he promiſed me to conuay me thence, and ſette me ſafe with ſome tryed friende in my Fathers kingdome.</p>
               <p>But Fortune yet not ſatiſ-fied with my ſo many iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, croſt vs againe in this determination, for by the way as we rode (with all circumſpection wee could deuiſe) wee met with certaine of <hi>Sabocos</hi> friendes, returning from ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king poſſeſſion of my fathers Realme in his behalfe. They knowing me, and out-facing mee that I laciuiouſly fledde from my huſband with the Gentleman of his Chamber, who (for my defence) had brought twentie friendes along with him, fell to ſuch diſcention with vs, that in the fight few on either part were left aliue, and I beeing mounted on a tame Hart, (according as the Queenes vſe to ride in thoſe Countries) doubtfull how the iſſue of the fight would prooue, fled into a wood not farre diſtant, for I had no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to expect good of <hi>Sabocos</hi> followers.</p>
               <p>As I rode on ſtill, looking where I might moſt conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently hide my ſelfe, it was my good happe to meete with theſe my two brethren, that by my meanes had eſcaped with ſafetie of life: they eſpying me a fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>They mounting vpon the Hart behind mee, becauſe in ſuch neede no time was to be loſt, wee gallopped away a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine thorow the wood, and came at length to a certaine Cittie of my Fathers kingdome, where <hi>Sabocos</hi> people, as yet had taken no poſſeſſion. There wee aſſured our ſelues of ſome ſecuritie, for when wee had aduertiſed the people, what had happened to the King and his ſonnes, we founde them ſo loyall, ready, and diligent, that they made liberall offer of theyr owne liues, for preſeruation of ours.</p>

               <p>All which notwithſtanding, our people continued theyr faythfull reſolution, deſiring rather a thouſand times their vndooing and deaths, then that we ſhould fall againe into the Tyrants hands.

                  <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Aboco,</hi> hauing doone diuers odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and barbarous trecheries to the <hi>Indians,</hi> grewe to be ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally hated of euery one, that for getting an others kingdome in ſuch bloody manner, hee was now in good forwardnes to looſe his owne. Wherefore, hearing how the Lady was ſo ſecretly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, to prouide her ſelfe of ſome Knight that might pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh his villanies, growing ſuſpitious withall of the <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Caualierie, whoſe fame was diſperſed quite thorow the world: fearing to enter combate in ſo vniuſt a cauſe, hée went to a Magitian of an hundred and foure-ſcore yeeres old, liuing there in his kingdome with good eſtéeme and fauour, and held with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beſt as a man of great experience, to him he imparted his minde, ſetting this downe as a full reſt and concluſion, that who ſoeuer ſhould come to combat in the Ladies defence, muſt by his ſkill be kept backe and impeached.</p>
               <p>The olde Wizard, who knewe that no enchauntment could continually endure, but that iuſtice will preuaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all ſorcery whatſoeuer, aduiſed <hi>Saboco</hi> to reſtore the Lady to her kingdome, and flie all occaſion of reſiſting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt right: but hee, more reſpecting worldly authoritie and pompe, then the puniſhment due to deedes of iniuſtice, with a ſterne countenaunce returned him this aunſwere. I come not to demaunde any counſell of thée, but helpe, therefore ſpéedily determine with thy ſelfe, that leaſt anie

Knight ſhould come to check my hopes, that thou hinder his paſſage by ſome powerfull incantations: and becauſe I ſee thee ſcant willing to pleaſure mée, I will not let thée depart, vntill I ſee my ſelfe free from all dread of danger.</p>
               <p>The old Magitian, ſéeing himſelfe in power of the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, performed ſuch an enchauntment as ſhall héereafter bée declared, but with ſmall hope of life, becauſe he knewe it by ſound experience, that againſt the progenie of worthie <hi>Palmerin,</hi> the greateſt enchauntment would prooue of no force: thus much as an inducement to that which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Florendos</hi> béeing mounted armed vppon his Courſer, and the Lady with her Brethren vppon the Hart, which they found by chaunce there attending for them, rode di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly toward the kingdome of <hi>Saboco,</hi> and ſcarely had they ridden the length of two leagues, but they beheld before them a farre off, a Mountaine ſo ſhining, as if it had beene of the pureſt ſiluer: whereat the Lady not a little meruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, becauſe ſhée ſawe none ſuch in the time of her flight, deſired the Knights oppinion thereon, who béeing well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Magicall illuſions, immediatly geſſed what it ſhould be, and ſaid. Faire not Lady, Knights haue many times met with ſuch enchauntments, and they are borne to conclude farre greater aduentures.</p>
               <p>The Lady perceiuing him to make no more reckoning thereof, beganne to forſake her former diſmaied counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce, ſo rode they on ſtill, vntill they came to the foote of that glittering Mountaine, where <hi>Florendos</hi> ſaw about ſome halfe a miles diſtance aboue him, a woman, that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of thirtie yeeres in age, and a young mayden of fiftéene whom ſhee held by the hand, both of them crying out aloude to him for help. The Knight noting them very aduiſedlie, thought the one to be <hi>Miragarda</hi> his wife, &amp; the other <hi>Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toria,</hi> daughter to Prince <hi>Florian,</hi> going along together hand in hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Florendos</hi> could no longer containe himſelfe, but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting from his horſe, prepared to climbe vp the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:14347:119"/>
after them: but by reaſon it was of fine polliſhed ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, when hée ſeemed to haue attained the height of tenne paces, he ſlid downe againe to the foote where he aſcended. Yet ſtill he heard the voyces call vnto him, the one of them hee tooke aſſuredly to be his wiues: and ſo ſtanding deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing how he might get vp, hee eſpied a poore fellowe with ſuch ſhooes as they vſed in that Country, hauing diuers ſharpe poynted ſtéeles faſtned to the ſoles, which would pierce into ſtones, or any thing whatſoeuer. Taking holde on that benefit, hee preſently prouided himſelfe a payre of the like, and ſo clambred vp much better then before, albeit oftentimes with very great perrill: and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming néere the place where he heard the voices call him, he felt the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to tremble vnder him, and the ſiluer to breake in pée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as though it would haue opened to ſwallow him.</p>
               <p>The ſight heereof made <hi>Iſotas</hi> hart to diſmay, fearing leaſt the Knight ſhould there perriſh: but <hi>Florendos</hi> truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in GOD, who neuer forſakes him that vndertakes a cauſe of iuſtice, ſtill held on his way, &amp; comming to a fayre plaine, he could not ſée the women whom he hoped to finde there, but there onely ſtoode a goodly Collomne or Piller, with this inſcription grauen vpon it.</p>
               <q>Heere, death for honour maist thou ſoone exchange.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Florendos</hi> reading this bréefe, and ſcorning all friuolous threats of Magicall charmes, ſate downe on the baſes that ſupported the Piller, to reſt himſelfe awhile, and to try if he could get a ſight of the women once more or no. He had not ſitten there halfe a quarter of an howre, conſidering with himſelfe what he was to doo, but hee felt himſelfe puld backward, as if ſome mans hand had ſhot forth of the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler and doone it: and ſtarting vp to ſee the reaſon thereof, hee beheld that the great Collomne was changed into a Giant of like height in ſtature, leading two Griffons in a leaſh, as if he had béene a Hunter.</p>
               <p>This Giant flew vppon him ſo fiercelie, as the Knight reputed himſelfe but a dead man, but yet to looſe nothing of what was in him, hee purpoſed to ſell his life at a verie
<pb facs="tcp:14347:120"/>
déere rate: one while deliuering ſome aſſurance of his val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour to the Giant, and then ſeuerally to the Griffons, who much annoyed him with theyr ſharpe gryping tallents, yet ſuch was his ſtrength and nimble dexteritie, as hee got fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them ſtill, though they held him nere ſo ſtrongly. The Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant followed him ſo eagerly with his Club, that hée knew not how to ſhunne his manifold heauie ſtroakes, til watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fit aduantage, ſtriking by a blowe meant very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly at him, he got within him, &amp; gaue him ſuch a wound in the throate, that he fell downe there-with, as if hée had béene ſlaine. When the Griffons ſaw the Giant fall, and themſelues gotten at libertie out of the leaſh, they ſeazed vpon the Knight with ſuch rauenous furie, as if they meant to teare him in péeces.</p>
               <p>But he, perceiuing himſelfe in ſuch extreame perrill, by good hap ſmote off the right wing of one of them, and wounded the other vpon the legge, as they could no longer keepe aloft vppon him: ſo the one béeing vnapt to flie, and the other to hold footing vpon the ground, hee was in good hope he had gotten the victory. But ſuddainly hee heard a great doore open, which ſéemed to ſhut vp the mouth of a huge deepe cauerne, and the Griffons entring thereat, hée beh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Then ſetting him downe vppon a great ſtone there ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to marke the end of ſo ſtrange a meruaile, as he looked round about him, there ruſhed foorth a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary way a great wilde Boare, with two doggs eagerly purſuing him: the Boare running mainly at the Knight, rent a peece of his Armour off, and hurt him in the ſide, and one of the dogges catching hold with his foote on his Shield, brake it off fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his necke, by reaſon the buckled leathers had no ſtrength <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>
                  <hi>Florendos,</hi> ſeeing himſelfe in this deſperate eſtate, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force got looſe his ſword from the dog, but the Boare com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming fiercely vpon him againe, ſo labourd him with his
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:14347:120"/>
ſharpe clawes and tuſkes, that he was conſtrained to fall downe, and the dog got the Sword againe, tugging it ſo violently, that the chaine which helde it faſtned about his arme, brake in twaine, and ſo hee was forced to let it goe out of his hand. The Boare trampled vpon him, euen as he pleaſed, and one of the dogs getting faſt hold on his foote, trayled him vp and downe along on the ground whether he liſted: in which extremitie, albeit <hi>Florendos</hi> could haue but little hope of life, yet did not his courage faile him a iote, and getting the Boare by one of his tuſkes, by meere ſtrength pluckt it out of his head, which made the beaſt, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe diſarmed in that part, to bee leſſe extreame then before he had béene, &amp; to keepe a little further off from the Knight.</p>
               <p>Nor ſtept hee vppon this fortunate aduantage, but faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning holde with his hand vpon one of the dogges legges, it prooued to him very ſucceſſefull: for the dogge pulling and tugging to get his legge looſe, by that meanes pluckt the Knight vp on his feete againe, where looking for ſomwhat to defend himſelfe withall, hee eſpyed the Giants Club ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the ground, which as hee ſtooped to take vp, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dogge got hold vpon his Helmet, and the laces break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through the violent pulling, doo what he could it fell off his head.</p>
               <p>This needes muſt be very diſpleaſing to the Knight, to be thus diſarmed where was moſt danger, but hope of vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie ſtill comforted him, and the Giants Club at libertie in his hand, he firſt layd at one dogge, and then at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other, with ſuch maine ſtrokes, that they ranne toward the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne ſo faſt as they could. <hi>Florendos</hi> looking in at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Caues mouth, eſpyed there his Sword and Helmet, which he bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſirous to enioy againe, without more adooe ſtept in to fetch them, when preſently the doore ſhut, and encloſed him within it.</p>
               <p>As hee went groping in the darke to finde his way, hee heard great clattering of Armour, as if there were ſome multitude of armed men, and that hee ſhould bee there en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
<pb facs="tcp:14347:121"/>
to fight with them: héereupon there hapned ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie a mightie earthquake, which made the Caue to open very wide behind him, where he did diſcerne twentie ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Knights, all prepared with their naked Swordes to come &amp; aſſaile him, which hee awaiting when they would doo it, and they not moouing at all, hee perceiued it was but a Magicall phantaſma, to terrifie ſuch as were not ſkilful in the like accidents.</p>
               <p>Now began he to imagine in his mind, that (ſince they ſtirred not any way to moleſt him) that aduenture was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, whereupon, ſtepping to them, they gaue him each one a light touch with their Swords, and preſently vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed he knew not which way: when <hi>Florendos</hi> ſaw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe off from the Mountaine, which ſéemed Siluer no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger as it had doone before, going on a little further, he found his Sword and Helmet lying together, as before he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken them from the dog: then arming his head, and taking his Sword ready drawne in his hand, hee went about de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſing with himſelfe, where <hi>Miragarda</hi> &amp; <hi>Victoria</hi> might be, whom he thought to be the women whom he had ſeene before.</p>
               <p>As hée looked about him héere and there, he beheld tenne Knights vpon the plaine, and one who ſéemed as Lord and commaunder of them, all riding a pace toward the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. This was <hi>Saboco,</hi> who vnderſtanding by the aged Nigromancer, what <hi>Florendos</hi> did from time to time, and how he proceeded thorow the enchauntment, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he heard that he had finiſhed the aduenture, in a mad rage hee kild the old Wizard, becauſe he did no better protect him by his ſkill. Then riding on toward the Mountaine, hee came thether euen as <hi>Florendos</hi> had newly diſcended, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing readily which way to take, but deſirous by all meanes he might to ſhunne the man, who had brought to end ſo ſtrange an aduenture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Florendos,</hi> by reaſon of his late paſſed turmoiles, being wearie, went a ſoftly pace, and finding his horſe there at the Mountaine foote, and mounting on his backe, rode to

vnderſtand what Knights thoſe were, as alſo to enquire for his Wife and Niece, which very curteouſly hee enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of <hi>Saboco</hi> himſelfe. But hée béeing very much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in his mind, as willing to auoyde all occaſions of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, returned him this aunſwere. Thou ſhouldſt be ſome pretty youthfull <hi>Ganimede,</hi> that demaundeſt for women a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Knights in Armes.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſcornefull words made <hi>Florendos</hi> check his horſe with the bridle, and giue the ſignall y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee would iouſt with him, which <hi>Saboco</hi> made no refuſall of, thinking him to be a man of no merrite at all. But ſuch was the encounter, as <hi>Saboco</hi> bare away <hi>Florendos</hi> his Helmet, becauſe (the laces béeing broken) he could not well faſten it on, and he was run quite thorowe the arme with the others Launce. The other Knights wondred at this valiant courſe, &amp; made offer of aſſiſtance to their Lord: but he, who imagined him ſelfe not meanely honored, if he could get the vpper hande of ſuch a braue gallant, cryed out to them to ſtay &amp; not ſtir, and drawing his ſword, he went againſt <hi>Florendos,</hi> vſing theſe words.

               <p>
                  <hi>Garnides</hi> pulling off his Gauntlet, ſhewed his naked hand, which was a ſigne that he would peaceably conferre with <hi>Primaleon,</hi> and <hi>Primaleon</hi> perceiuing it, dreadleſſe drew néere, when <hi>Garnides</hi> returned him this aunſwere. With patience (Sir Knight) I hope you will heare me, I haue held the kingdome belonging to <hi>Filenia,</hi> by ſuch order as the King her Father appointed me, becauſe her brother dyed by a fatall accident, which <hi>Bernuccio</hi> falſely and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly imputing to me, as if that I had either done or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured it, got hence the Princeſſe, then but very young, and enchaunted her in a Ship with certaine Lyons, which (it ſhould appeare) you haue by your vallour ended. If then I haue not doone what you déeme expedient, herſelfe béeing now at liberty, I will performe what ſoeuer you woulde haue mée: for by no meanes will I aduenture the combate with you, both in regard of your renowned vertues, as alſo becauſe no good ſucceſſe attends on ill actions.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſpéeches deliuered with very good lookes &amp; calme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, ſo preuailed in the minde of <hi>Primaleon,</hi> that beléeuing faithfully what he ſaid, he went very kindly with him into his Caſtle, though much againſt Lord <hi>Traſinos</hi> mind that was there with him: neuertheleſſe, he was very graciouſly entertained, and the Knight expreſſed equall curteſie, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glad <hi>Filenia</hi> ſhould haue her kingdom quietly reſtored, without combatting with a man ſo ful of affability, as <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides</hi> outwardly declared himſelfe to be.</p>
               <p>The dinner was ſerued in moſt ſumptuouſly, and the more to ſecure him from any imagination of ill meaning, hee ſent for a Lady his Daughter of very exquiſite beautie, commaunding her to ſit right before <hi>Primaleon,</hi> which ſo

highly pleaſed him, ſéeing her ſo beautifull and vertuouſlie modeſt withall, as ſuddainly he became much enamoured of her.</p>
               <p>Dinner beeing ended, a fayre Violl <hi>de gamba</hi> was brought her, whereon the Lady ſo rarely and cunninglie playd, and ſung thereto with a voyce ſo ſweet and heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, that <hi>Primaleon,</hi> though his thoughts forbad him to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect her, yet was hee well contented to heare her, &amp; the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to hold out conference with her, oft would hee vrge her to play ſome leſſons twiſe or thriſe ouer, and to ſing againe diuers of her ditties, eſpecially theſe two following, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he very much delighted.</p>

                  </hi> Then her thoughts diuined, that this was the name of the Knight whom ſhee loued, ſo taking it with her into her chamber, ſhee read it at large, and found it was written by <hi>Filenia,</hi> the Daughter to King <hi>Friſoll,</hi> who layd the platforme of the treaſon whereby the Knight was taken.</p>
               <p>Now began a certaine kinde of iealouſie to apprehende her thoughts, afflicting her beyond all ſufferable courſe, ſuſpecting that <hi>Filenia</hi> affected her Louer, becauſe hee had done ſo much in her deliuerance, and perhaps through de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying her kinde ſolicitations, ſhee entred into this diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure againſt him, which made her now the more earneſt in procuring his libertie.</p>
               <p>Héere-uppon, ſhée called a truſtie Coſin vnto her, who waited on her as her neereſt gentlewoman, and promiſing her rich and ſtately aduauncement, if things might ſort to her expectation, they both became confederate in this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe. So the night following, they went to a windowe but of ſlender ſtrength, whereof her Father (it ſéemed) had no knowledge, yet it abutted vppon his daughters lodging,
<pb facs="tcp:14347:126"/>
and therein was <hi>Primaleon</hi> encloſed as a priſoner: where knocking ſoftly on the glaſſe, <hi>Primaleon</hi> beeing awake, and remembring the promiſe which <hi>Laurea</hi> had made him, ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vp to ſée who it was that knocked, and ſtepping vpon a table before the window, layd his head cloſe to the glaſſe, when the Lady (without holding him in any tedious ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpence) ſaid.</p>
               <p>Behold my Lord, now am I as good as my word, heere am I ready to die for your deliuerance, take this Pikaxe, and imploying it as by your ſtrength you very wel can, get forth of this ill harbour, &amp; for the reſt leaue mee to prouide. <hi>Primaleon,</hi> beholding the Lady before him, and ſo happie a meanes to free him from death which he hourelie expected, was both glad and ſad: glad of his owne ſafetie, but ſadde withall, when he conſidered, that when he was eſcaped, he could not requite the Lady to her expectation, hazarding her fame and life ſo prodigally for him. Notwithſtanding, bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bound to the beſt aduantage in a caſe ſo deſperate, hee tooke the inſtrument, and wreſted out the yron barres in ſuch ſort, as hee made a faire large wide window, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out came foorth. So all thrée together getting vp on the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtell wall, by the helpe of certaine cordes faſtned together, which purpoſely had béene left there by the King himſelfe, if a dangerous hazard ſhould betide him, ſo to eſcape away vnſéene of any.</p>
               <p>The Women diſcended with very great difficultie, and mounted the déepe ditch againe with as much labour, but hauing with ſafetie paſſed both, they entred y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wood, where they founde <hi>Traſino</hi> attending with the horſes, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent all loſſe of time, away they galloped toward his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtell.</p>
               <p>Now it came to paſſe, that <hi>Garnides</hi> (conſidering what a great perſon hee had ſeazed on) all the next day was ſo doubtfull in his minde, as hee forgot to giue the key as hee was wont to doe, for carriage of foode to the priſoner: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, <hi>Laureas</hi> waiting woman, ſéeing her Chamber ſhutte that was gone with her Lady, imagined her Miſtreſſe to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:14347:126"/>
be there with her Coſin, about a curious péece of embroide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie whereon they wrought, and often vſed to be thereabout ſo alone by themſelues.</p>
               <p>All things thus continued on till dinner time, when ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they came not forth, neither made aunſwere to ſuch as knockt, vpon a ſudden an out-cry was made, which calling the King thether, the doore béeing opened with certaine en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines, no body there founde, and the chamber windowe (though cunningly cloſed againe) yet appearing to be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, the Pikaxe there lying, and the barres of yron that had béene wreſted out, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he perceiued, that by his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters meanes the Knight was deliuered. Nowe was hee in more extreame ſuſpition then before, not knowing what courſe was now beſt to be taken, yet at laſt hee concluded, that he would not ſend after them, but thus diſcourſed with his thoughts: Since <hi>Laurea</hi> had doone ſo much for a Knight of ſuch nobilitie, it ſéemed likely, that doubtleſſe hee would accept her as his wife, and ſo in marriage ſhée ſhoulde be highlie aduaunced: then flying from this conceite, by craft hee would make out to catch him if hee coulde, ſo was hee blinded with feare of looſing his kingdome.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Primaleon,</hi> with a company thought conuenient, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to returne and ambuſh themſelues in the Woode, to take <hi>Garnides</hi> if hee ſhould ſtirre out of the Caſtell: ſo lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <hi>Laurea</hi> ſafely in the Pallace, he cauſed <hi>Traſino</hi> to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect twenty valiant Knights, euery one béeing allied to him in blood, and ſo they parted thence into a wood, which was foure miles diſtant from where the King lay. Not fullie two dayes had they there remained, but they tooke a Spy that affirmed to them, that <hi>Garnides</hi> was not diſpleaſed at the Knights loſſe or his Daughters, but prepared his men to depart from thence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Primaleon</hi> fore-thinking what the King ſhoulde intend thereby, kept it to himſelfe, and about ſome two houres af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, hee beheld an hundred Knights, which deuided them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues into thrée parts or companies, becauſe <hi>Garnides</hi> (not knowing that <hi>Primaleon</hi> had recouered <hi>Traſinos</hi> Caſtell)
<pb facs="tcp:14347:127"/>
imagined, hee had hid himſelfe in thoſe woods adioyning, and beeing vnarmed, he might there the eaſier be once more poſſeſſed of him.</p>
               <p>Theſe three bands of Knights, hauing diuers houndes attending on them, ſearched all about, diſperſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſo farre each from other, as they coulde heare what was doone by the noyſe they made. The Kings companie hearing the hounds at a bay, made haſt to the place, where <hi>Primaleon</hi> couching his Launce againſt <hi>Garnides,</hi> who knew not him, pierced quite through his Armour into his ſhoulder, and caſt him quite beſide his horſe.</p>
               <p>The King thus wounded and layd on the ground, ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed all his other followers, that ſéeing <hi>Traſino</hi> come vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them with his twentie Knights, they betooke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to flight, leauing their King behinde them: who bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken by <hi>Traſino,</hi> and bound vpon his owne horſe, they conducted him ſafely to his Caſtell, where béeing commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his daughters cuſtodie, for care and dreſſing of the hurt hee had receiued, they would afterward determine what was to be done with him.</p>

               <p>This Letter was highly welcommed to <hi>Primaleon,</hi> as béeing an eſpeciall meanes to further his purpoſe, and to quittance both the Traytors in theyr due kinde, euen with ſuch chaſtiſement as hee déemed moſt conuenient: Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, hee cauſed <hi>Laurea</hi> to diſſemble with her Father, that he muſt ſuffer death according to his treaſons deſerts. The next morning, he wrote vnto <hi>Filenia,</hi> that ſhe ſhoulde come to <hi>Traſinos,</hi> where he held <hi>Garnides</hi> as a Traytour: theſe newes were nothing pleaſing to the Ladie, yet ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining that <hi>Primaleon</hi> knewe nothing of her plotted tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie, and hoping to repoſſeſſe her Kingdome againe, ſhée iournied thether, ſecuring herſelfe with her Lyons: but they were no ſooner out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Caſtel, when preſently the Lyons forſooke and left her, in regard ſhee was become a traytreſſe, and broken her princely faith, and like enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement found ſhe there at her arriuall, béeing ſhutte vp like an offendour in a cloſe Chamber, and vſed as if ſhe had beene a priſoner.</p>
               <p>Now in the time of ordering theſe occaſions, and the Ladies expectation for repoſſeſſion of her kingdome, when <hi>Garnides</hi> was indifferently recouered, <hi>Primaleon</hi> taking <hi>Traſino</hi> with him, and <hi>Laurea</hi> with <hi>Filenia,</hi> who gaue the other many a ſcornfull and iealous looke, in regarde of her former loue to the Knight of Fortune: they all entred the Chamber of <hi>Garnides,</hi> where ſuddenly he became ſo full of gréefe to beholde them, in that all his cruell hopes were ſo croſt and ouerthrowne, as his ſences failing him, hee fell downe in a ſwoune.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laurea</hi> beeing preſent at this gréeuous ſpectacle, moued with naturall compaſſion of her Father, went &amp; recouered him, preuailing ſo well with diuerſitie of good arguments,
<pb facs="tcp:14347:128"/>
as ſhée pacified his perturbations in very reaſonable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, when <hi>Primaleon</hi> taking <hi>Garnides</hi> by the boſome, and <hi>Filenia</hi> by the hand, thus ſpake.</p>
               <p>Let me now tell yee, that like two Traytors you ought to be diſmembred aliue, which the rather I ſhould conſent vnto, more for obſeruation of iuſtice then any reuenge of mine owne iniuries: but confeſſing my ſelfe in ſome ſorte obliged to <hi>Filenia,</hi> for her good aduiſe in the enchaunted Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtell of <hi>Bernuccio,</hi> makes me the more willing to ſaue her life, and the debt I confeſſe as due to <hi>Laurea,</hi> for ſo kind de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuering me from impriſonment, commaunds that I like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe pardon her Fathers life.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Filenia</hi> was hardly contented with this deuiſion, but ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how her liues perrill ſtoode on vrging the contrarie, ſhe willingly condiſcended: the like did <hi>Garnides,</hi> who thought his deſperate aduenture had made a happy returne, in gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning faire <hi>Filenia</hi> whom he déerely loued. Héereupon, they were immediatly eſpouſed together, and ſent to the Caſtell which he had aſſigned them, all which beeing finiſhed, hée called <hi>Laurea</hi> to him, ſaying: I will neuer deny, but that my life is a due debter to you in any occurrences whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, but becauſe I cannot ſatiſ-fie your harts deſire, which (in plainer termes) is to be your huſband, and a reaſon of importance doth directly ſtand againſt it, namely, my boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

and dutiful ſeruice to a Lady long ſince engaged, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, though hetherto my deſerts haue beene ſlender, yet ſince my fortune is no better, I muſt reſt content there-with. Notwithſtanding, becauſe I would acknowledge in part, though vtterly vnable to come néere your merrit, my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward readines to doe you ſeruice, let me intreat you to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a perſon more worthy then my ſelfe, the noble Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie <hi>Traſino,</hi> diſcended of the royall progenie, and for his loyall fayth kept to King <hi>Friſoll</hi> his Lorde, farre better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming you then any other: with him ſhall you enioy the faire kingdome of the <hi>Morning Ilands,</hi> and holde me in duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſeruice euer as your Knight, ſo farre as I offende not my gracious Lady and Miſtreſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laurea,</hi> who little expected ſuch an aunſwere, with the teares in her eyes, ſaid. My Lorde, you haue ſuch power and ſoueraigntie ouer mee, as not daring to deny whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer you commaunde, I reſt ſatiſ-fied with your appoynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and albeit your promiſe gaue me greater hope, I will burie all in ſilence. For I know by experience of my owne loues fire, that you cannot eaſily giue ouer affection, where the chaine of eſpeciall liking hath intirely lincked you: keepe this then in memory, that héereafter I may boldly call you my Knight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Primaleon</hi> was exceedingly contented, hearing the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die ſo kindlie to accept his offer, becauſe he ſhould now wel reward the Countie <hi>Traſino,</hi> (to whom as yet hee had not made this knowne) for all the fauour and good wil he had found by him: and hauing <hi>Garnides</hi> his Ring, wherby all the Forts ſhould bee ſurrendred vp, they leuied two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men, with whom they went from Iland to Iland, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <hi>Laurea</hi> likewiſe in their company, the people dooing great honours to her, becauſe there was neither Citty, nor Caſtell, but helde firme remembrance of ſome benefite or other, which by meanes of her interceſſions they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore receiued.</p>
               <p>Hauing thus the full ſtate in their owne power, and bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing entred into the cheefe royall Citty, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> night they lodged
<pb facs="tcp:14347:129"/>
in the Pallace, where <hi>Primaleon</hi> lying that night with the Countie <hi>Traſino,</hi> none béeing neere but themſelues alone, he thus ſpake. I haue daily labored in my thoughts, which way to requite ſo honourable loue and kindnes, as to me a poore vnknowne Knight you haue extended: wherein yet at length the heauens haue fauoured mee, and though it reach not to your woorthy deſeruings, yet accept it as an earneſt of a greater good will. You ſée how Madame <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea</hi> is beloued of theſe people, who notwithſtanding can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer rule them well without a huſband, therefore will I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow her on you in marriage, and the kingdome likewiſe with her as her dowrie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Traſino</hi> hearing ſuch an offer made him, whereof hee neuer had hope or expectation, ſuddenly fell on his knee, and kiſſing his hand, ſaid: Nowe is it ſeene for an euident truth, that the famous race of <hi>Palmerin d'Oliua,</hi> is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly powerfull in gaining kingdoms, but euen as prompt in giuing them: it were diſhonour in mee to refuſe the gyft, comming from ſo royall a hand, enioying thereby ſo fayre a Lady, and a kingdome ſo wealthy and populous.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Primaleon</hi> béeing well pleaſed with this aunſwere, the next morning wrought ſo with <hi>Laurea,</hi> that ſhee cauſed to aſſemble there many armed Knights, thoſe in whoſe truſt ſhée might beſt relye, leaſt the people ſhould enter into any commotion, and in two dayes they had gathered in one co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie aboue two thouſand, who ioyning with them belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Traſino,</hi> caſt themſelues in a Ring about a Scaffold erected before the Pallace, whereon <hi>Primaleon</hi> ſoone after ſhewed himſelfe, hauing the Ladie <hi>Laurea</hi> and <hi>Traſino</hi> in his company, with more then twenty of the chiefeſt Lords in the kingdome, who were well contented to haue ſuch a King, beeing familiarly acquainted with his fayth and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable diſpoſition, as alſo that he was deſcended of the progenie royall.</p>
               <p>The people there in this manner aſſembled, and <hi>Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon</hi> commaunding ſilence by a ſigne made with his hand, he thus began. You haue already found by very good proofe,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:14347:129"/>
what difference is betwéene a good King &amp; a Tyrant, and albeit I could acquaint yée with the benefits enſuing by the one, and ſad deſaſters attending on the other, yet doo I not now hold it ſo neceſſary, becauſe your owne laſt tryal of ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is ſufficient. It is enough for mee to tell yée, that the Tyrant is chaſed hence, and ſhée to whom the Kingdome in right appertained, turning Traytreſſe to her owne iuſt ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and her defenders damage, ſtands likewiſe depriued of her prerogatiue: and that you néede make no doubt of <hi>File<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi> treaſon, héere is the Letter written to <hi>Garnides</hi> vnder her owne hand, which whoſoeuer ſhall make any ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous queſtion of, at any time the ſight thereof ſhall more at large reſolue him.</p>
               <p>Nowe, in regard I would not leaue you ſubiected to anie other Kingdoms emperie, though partly by deſert, but moſt of all by iuſtice, the diſpoſing of this eſtate conſiſteth in mee: I commit both it and you to the noble Countie <hi>Traſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> whom you all know to be a man of eſpeciall merrit, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured and eſtéemed by this Lady, wel loued of you all, and theſe doo I appoynt to be your King and Quéene.</p>
               <p>No ſooner had he thus ſpoken, but the Crowne of leaues and flowers (vſed of long antiquitie in thoſe part) was brought vnto him, where-with hauing firſt dignified the King, he afterward placed it on the Lady <hi>Laureas</hi> head: to the no little contentment of all the people, right glad to ſée themſelues ſo freed from the Tyrant, and likely now to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy much peace and tranquilitie, ſo with loud ſhoutes they celebrated the names of their King and Quéene.</p>
               <p>This was as pleaſing to <hi>Primaleon,</hi> becauſe his minde ranne ſtill on the aduenture of Fortune, which <hi>Dorina</hi> was to conduct him vnto: wherefore, he would needs haue them immediatly married, and paſſing on royally to the cheefe Church, after a ſolemne Maſſe ſung by an Arch-biſhoppe of very holy life, the marriage was performed, with greater content of the King then the Quéene, who with much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will would haue had <hi>Primaleon.</hi> But after better conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, that ſhe could not enioy him whom ſhe ſo deerelie
<pb facs="tcp:14347:130"/>
affected, <hi>Traſino,</hi> béeing the very nobleſt and moſt eſtéemed Knight of the Kingdome, ſhe beganne to reſpect him with a more regardfull eye, and in their returne backe to the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, ſhe ſhewed him ſuch gracious and delightſome lookes, that <hi>Traſino</hi> (doubtfull before of her grace and fauour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding an alteration ſo ſtrange yet pleaſing) accounted his happines beyond compariſon. The feaſting was ſollemnly performed at the expence of the treaſure royall, euen that which <hi>Garnides</hi> had (with mighty taxations) gotten toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: for hee beeing ſtill doubtfull what ſhould befall him, made prouiſion of treaſure to carry with him when neede ſhold require, euermore thinking to eſcape thence by flight, but it ſorted not to his expectation.</p>
               <p>The feaſt continued for eyght dayes together, and lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the King would haue had it in the honour of <hi>Primaleon,</hi> but he whoſe minde was labouring elſe where, ful of heate and haſtie expectation, that he might the ſooner ſée his <hi>Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toria,</hi> firſt made the King and Queene ſwear to execute iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and that <hi>Garnides</hi> nor <hi>Filenia</hi> ſhould raiſe any more commotions, but iuſtly and truly performe theyr homage, likewiſe, all the people vowing to doo their loyall allege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, he prepared to depart on his iourney.</p>
               <p>Many meanes were made for his longer detayning, yet all would not ſerue to hinder his determination: but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> next morning following, taking the King by the hand, and kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Quéenes fore-head, as the cuſtome there is, ſhee ſhewed herſelfe much diſpleaſed for his departure: Which ſhe perceiuing the King to noate, turned backe to him with theſe ſpeeches.</p>
               <p>Be not ſuſpitious my Lorde, if at the departure of thys Knight, (whom indeede I once loued farre better then you) I expreſſe ſome outward diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentment, becauſe I thought to haue enioyed him as my huſband: but my fortune there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in failing me, by reaſon of his loue elſe where addicted, giue me leaue a while to grow forgetful of him, which by little and little I ſhall eaſily attaine vnto, &amp; then let this be your ſetled perſwaſion, that I ſhall affect you as intirely, as I do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

Theſe words were deliuered with ſuch geſture and maieſtie, that the King both admired and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commended her: ſo, after ſome ſmall diſcourſe concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſtate affaires, he deſcended with <hi>Primaleon</hi> downe the ſtayres, where after an honourable kinde embracing, hee mounted on horſebacke, and ſo departed.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Lorendos</hi> and <hi>Saboco</hi> had theyr wounds well looked vnto, and the danger of life on neither ſide now to be doubted, whereuppon, <hi>Iſota</hi> was ſent for and her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who came together, yet ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie fearefully, as timerous of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bocos</hi> cruell handling: but when they came to the chamber where they both lay wounded, <hi>Saboco</hi> ſhewed ſuch affable ſignes of loue and kindnes, as the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die grewe into good ſecuritie of her ſelfe, hearing that hee would fulfill what-ſoeuer was enioyned him, and reſtore the Kingdom of Dwarffes to her elder brother named <hi>Pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meo,</hi> the other to haue honourable reſpect beſide.</p>
               <p>While thus they attended theyr hurts recouery, <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos</hi> was very deſirous to know, whether any Ladies were hidden in the Mountaine or no, becauſe that two had there appeared to him, whom he thought to be his wife <hi>Miragar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> and the young Lady <hi>Victoria:</hi> but béeing reſolued by the Lords there preſent, that all thoſe illuſions were doone by the Magicall wizzard, he forbare to queſtion any further in the matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14347:131"/>Before ten dayes were fully paſſed, by good care and dil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence they were thorowly recouered, then were diuers Chariots of Ladies prepared, onely to accompany and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend on <hi>Iſota:</hi> ſo rode they honourably to the chiefe Citty of the Kingdome, where their feaſting and entertainement was beyond compariſon, and <hi>Florendos</hi> (as a man going beyond all other in famous deſerts) welcommed, and very honourably reſpected. Thence departed they to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Dwarffes, where <hi>Pigmeo</hi> was created King, and there they gaue themſelues to all kind of pleaſures, but moſt of all they delighted in hunting: wherein <hi>Florendos</hi> ſtill bore the chiefeſt praiſe, for killing the fierceſt and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt beaſts.</p>
               <p>One day among the reſt, when they were preparing to goe to the woods, <hi>Pigmeo</hi> ordained that euery man ſhould arme himſelfe, becauſe there liued a Serpent ſo bloody and cruell, as of whole multitudes that had gone to encounter him, not one could be known to returne back againe. That morning, <hi>Florendos,</hi> being deſirous to deliuer the Country of ſuch a deuouring Monſter, ſent for an yron maule that <hi>Saboco</hi> had, with certaine pykes extended out at the clubbe end, about ſome foure yards long, and making it faſt at his ſaddle pommell, on he rode with them towardes the place: huge numbers of people following very ioyfully, not a little proude of hauing the Knight in their company, by whoſe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour they had good hope to be fréed from the Serpent. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſing themſelues ſeuerally thorow the woods, it was <hi>Pigmeos</hi> hap to meete firſt with the Serpent, from whom he prepared himſelfe ſpéedily to flie, for he was mounted on the Hart he had vſed to ride on: but by ouer-much haſt hee fell beſide his beaſt, and ſo the Serpent got him vp in his mouth, till perceiuing he was a man of ſo little ſtature, as ſcorning a pray of no bigger moment, hee threw him from him againe, ſo that what with feare and force of the fall, he lay ſtill as quite bereft of ſence, beeing hardly able to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer him ſelfe againe. When the Dwarffes at firſt ſawe theyr King in the Serpents mouth, they gaue ſuch a lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:14347:131"/>
out-cry, that <hi>Florendos</hi> and the reſt preſently gallop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped thether: where the Serpent came very proudly againſt them, all the Indians not daring abide to behold him, but onely <hi>Saboco</hi> and a Coſin of his, who were gotten vp into a high ſtanding, to ſée how <hi>Florendos</hi> ſhould ſpeed againſt the Serpent.</p>
               <p>Hee, hauing the fore-named Maule in his hand, and the Serpent making furiouſly at him, ſcaped the Monſters firſt proffer, and wounded him in the left wing, ſtriking off di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of his hard ſcailes: whereat the Serpent grew ſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, that ſuddainly fetching his taile about, he got y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Knight faſt by the Helmet there-with, &amp; making him turne round giddily three times together, ſmit him down at laſt againſt a great ſtone on the Mountaines ſide, and ſuch was the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happines of the ſtroke, that hee fell downe backward, and the Serpent (as vaunting of already gotten victory) paſſed quite ouer him, thinking (as others had ſped before) that he had giuen him his lateſt payment. But the Knight, nimbly recouering footing againe, nothing at all diſmayed with the ſtroke he had receiued, made out into a more ſpacious part of the wood, where by his actiue dexteritie, he might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter helpe himſelfe.</p>
               <p>The Serpent perceiuing his labour not ended, followed him with exceeding rage and furie, where the Knight ſo plyed him with the poynted Maule, that ſtrewing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground plentifully with his hard ſcailes, he gaue him diuers little hurts and wounds, albeit the Monſter helde out ſo againſt him, that he would not permit him the very leaſt breathing while. At length, by ouer-much labour &amp; expence of blood, <hi>Florendos</hi> perceiued the Monſter to waxe weary, whereon, hee aduaunced himſelfe the boldlier before him, and gaue him a very ſhrewde wound in the face: whereat he ſhewed himſelfe ſo enraged, that whéeling againe his long taile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, he got the Knight faſt by the midſt, and throwing him on his backe betwixt his winges, ranne ſo away with him. <hi>Saboco</hi> béeing much grieued to behold him in this danger, prepared to follow him, but it auailed nothing, for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent

ranne excéeding ſwiftly, leaping ouer buſhes, rocks and hillockes, where a horſe had not the power to purſue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Florendos,</hi> feeling no other diſcommoditie, but that hee was thus borne from the ground, after he had with much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe vnwound himſelfe out of the Serpents tayle, leapt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly on his feete, and gaue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Monſter ſuch a ſtroke with his Maule on the head, as, though it ſlaunted ſome-what a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, yet it ſmitte him to the grounde: and thinking then to ſteppe vpon him and diſpatch him, the Maule fell out of his hand ſo neere the Monſter, that hee coulde not recouer it without manifeſt perrill, which made him then to vſe the benefite of his ſword: and comming therewith againſt the Serpent, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Saboco,</hi> who with his Coſin had followed the poyſoning ſmoulder of the Serpent, came at the inſtant, when a farre off hee ſawe the Monſter fall, but not ſéeing <hi>Florendos,</hi> his hart became ſo full of griefe, that mending his pace with greater haſt, he came and found him lying like a man dead. Taking off his Helmet, and perceiuing that hee breathed not, he gaue forth many dolorous complaints: whereat his Coſin breaking forth into a laughter, ſayd. Now dooſt thou euidently prooue thy ſelfe to be a foole, in bemoaning his death, that depriued thee of all thy former honor: me thinks thou ſhouldeſt rather draw forth thy weapon, and ſmite off his head, then abuſe time thus with childiſh lamentations: if I were as thou, I would do it immediatly.

               <p>During theſe ſpéeches, <hi>Florendos</hi> recouered, and <hi>Iſota</hi> with the other Ladies were likewiſe aſſembled, whence they parted with <hi>Florendos</hi> in a royall Litter to the Cittie, where <hi>Iſota</hi> vſed many comfortable ſpéeches to him, ſuch as indeede did well content him: and <hi>Saboco</hi> cauſed the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent to be brought thether, and the ſkinne to be taken off, that <hi>Florendos</hi> might ſende it to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> as a monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his perpetuall honour, and the body beeing deuided into ſeuerall parts, was hanged vp in diuers eſpeciall pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Cittie.</p>

                  <hi>Trineus</hi> ſéeing that there was now in the Court none of the young Knights, that might haue vndertaken to cleare this doubt, crauing licence of the Emperour, went preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and armed him ſelfe, becauſe he was enamoured of faire <hi>Argentina</hi> the Infant of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and returning againe to them, after he had taken farewell of all the other Princeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Ladies, he came and fell on his knee before her, and requeſting her hand to kiſſe, ſpake in this manner. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, my ſpéeches to you muſt be after the blunt <hi>Allmaigne</hi> faſhion, ſuch is your beauty, as it giues mee courage, to maintaine againſt any that dare denie it, that you are the very faireſt Lady this day liuing, and worthy the ſeruice of all other whatſoeuer: grace me then with ſo much fauour, that I may entitle my ſelfe by the name of your Knight, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to add luſter to the firſt enterpriſe that I ſhall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, wherein I doubt not, but being armed with your gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious regard, I ſhall gaine immortall renowne, all which

               <p>The Infant, in the déepe reach of her owne diſcretion, perceauing the young Emperour to eye her with affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate regarding, began to diſpoſe her thoughts to the like, as well in reſpect of his faire and gentle demeanour, as alſo to reach the height of an Empreſſe: for women are ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous by nature, and often times doo ſtriue to out-goe others in beauty and rich ornaments, rather then in diſcréete and vertuous reputation, but returning to <hi>Argentina,</hi> thus ſhee replied.</p>

                  <hi>Oliuanto,</hi> who ſtroue to make himſelfe famous, by any aduenturous attempt whatſoeuer, imagined (as well he might) that this would proue to be ſome ſtrange enchaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: whereupon, with-drawing aſide on the left hand of the Armie, hee aduaunced himſelfe forward beyond all the reſt, and then he might diſcerne it like the ſhape of a Tent, wherof none of the Chriſtian Knights but himſelfe (as yet) had any ſuch ſight.</p>
               <p>When he had ſtrayed from the reſt about a bowe-ſhoote, he gaue his horſe the ſpurres, &amp; riding all night very hard, the next day by noone hee came neere to the Tent, where beholding nothing but certaine poynts of Launces, which were thruſt thorow a doore that ſéemed faſt ſhut, hee would needes yet venture ſo neere to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Tent, that he might heare (as to him it ſeemed) the ruſtling of men at Armes beyond it ſome ſmall diſtance. Héereupon he ſtoode ſtill, and called out aloude, but neither ſeeing any body, nor hearing anie aunſwere returned, hee could no longer containe himſelfe, but coueting to end this aduenture before the other Knights arriuall, he knocked hard at the doore, which preſently hée beheld to open, and with-draw the Launces backe in ſuch ſort, that his entrance was very eaſily admitted.</p>
               <p>No ſooner had he ſtept into the Tent, but he felt himſelfe changed by force of the enchauntment, and nothing elſe could enter into his thoughts, but that the onely reaſon of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming thether, was to kéepe the paſſage there, againſt all commers, and to try theyr valour by iouſting, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they were.

               <p>The next day following, as hée ſtood armed in the doore of the Tent, hée might a farre off, eaſily behold the Armies Launces, before whom (ſome pretty diſtaunce) brauely

               <p>By this time the whole Army was there arriued, which (by reaſon of the haſtie approche of the night) lodged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues very neere to the place enchaunted: but <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> going forth vnarmed to behold the Tent, knewe <hi>Oliuanto,</hi> and the other two in his company: who taking no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of his nakednes without Armes, made all very furiouſly againſt him, euen with as great violence as if they would haue ſlaine him.

                  <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> gathering by apparant likelihood, that theſe Knights (béeing his true affected &amp; endeared friendes) were depriued of all knowledge of him, by the force of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chauntment: was glad that he went forth ſo vnprouided of armes, &amp; returned againe in ſuch ſafety, without any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice either to his or their honour. And being come backe to the royall Pauillion, where <hi>Floraman</hi> (their chiefe Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine generall) had conuocated all the Princes together, as holding a ſollemne councell about the view of this ſtrange Tent: he found <hi>Florendos</hi> to be much troubled in minde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Oliuanto,</hi> fearing leaſt he had ſtrayed abroad to take notice of the Tent, and ſo vnhappily remained therein en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunted.

               <p>This ſtrange and vnaccuſtomed kind of enchauntment, gaue all the Princes matter of déepe and ponderous conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, wherein they coulde not ſet downe any certaine reſolution. As for <hi>Florendos</hi> himſelfe, this was his groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and ſetled opinion, that his owne ſonne would neuer dare to come againſt him, whereon hee determined to goe forth the next morning.</p>
               <p>No ſooner did bright day péepe her fayre fore-head foorth, but beeing armed by his Squire, he mounted on horſeback, and trotting brauely before the Tent, <hi>Oliuanto</hi> with his other two companions (enforced thereto by the enchaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments vigour) all thrée together encountred him with their Launces, ſo that he fell on the ground vnder his horſe bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and before he could frée himſelfe out of their power, hée was carried in priſoner, and poſſeſſed with the ſelfe ſame humour as they were, yet none of them there all this while knowing one another.</p>
               <p>Our braue reſolutes amongſt the Chriſtians, were not a little offended, when they vnderſtoode that <hi>Florendos</hi> was

of <hi>Floraman</hi> their Commaunder, who pauſed thereon very aduiſedly, for better apprehenſion of this enchantme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts danger: and ſo much the rather, becauſe if they two ſhould oppoſe themſelues againſt <hi>Florendos, Dramuſiande, Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanto</hi> and the other twaine, nothing elſe could be expected, but that ſome one either part were ſure to miſcarie, and of ſuch a perrill it behooued him to haue no meane care.</p>

Wherefore, finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe this extraordinarily hindred, he grewe into great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience,
<pb facs="tcp:14347:139"/>
vntill at length hee happened to remember thoſe Bookes, which he found hidden in the garden of his Iland, and going to the place, where with no meane care hee kept them, turning them ouer one after another, he chaunced at laſt to light on this very ſame enchauntment, receiuing thence ſuch rules and directions in the caſe, as were ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to make it of no account, whereof thus prouided, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted well pleaſed.</p>
               <p>Nowe come we againe to Prince <hi>Palmerin,</hi> who could not beare ſo many challengings and prouocations to the fight, but (fired with vexation) would needs goe arme him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, the like did noble <hi>Florian</hi> his brother, both earneſtlie ſtriuing which ſhould be the formoſt, not dreading any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that might befall them from the other, and when they were armed, <hi>Floraman, Gratian, Blandidon,</hi> and <hi>Francian,</hi> came to diſſwade them, vſing theſe or the like ſpéeches.</p>
               <p>My Lords, doo ye not account it as a matter wel worthy blame, for you two to goe hazard the combate againſt ſo many hardie Knights? And looke you with no more iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into this enchauntment, which differs from all other in ſo ſtrange a qualitie, that it requires as many reſiſters, as ſhall be found defenders of the Tent? Be better aduiſed wee intreate yée, and let vs take this courſe: Lord <hi>Blandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> whom we ought moſt eſpecially to preſerue from this Magick, hee ſhall abide heere for Commaunder of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and we thrée (béeing armed) will goe along with you to the Tent, ſo ſhall wee be ſure to equall our friendly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries in number.</p>
               <p>This counſell, as beeing indeede very diſcréete and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, was by euery one commended, and when they had put on their Armour, they went toward the Tent, beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God to guard them all from perrill. <hi>Florendos</hi> and the other with him (without giuing any attention to <hi>Palmerin,</hi> who wafted them towards him with his hand vnarmed, as deſirous firſt to haue ſome ſpeech with them) placed theyr Launces in their reſts, and ran againſt the other with the very ſwifteſt carriere of their horſes, when <hi>Palmerin,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:14347:139"/>
no reſpite at all to receiue a Launce, was taken tardie by <hi>Florendos</hi> thus vnprouided, and looſing his ſtirrops, lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked but little of being diſmounted. <hi>Florian</hi> encountred with <hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> and lay both along on the ground, with their ſaddles betwéene their thighes: <hi>Floraman</hi> with <hi>Oliuanto,</hi> receiuing by him ſome ſmall diſaduantage: <hi>Gracian</hi> with <hi>Berolde</hi> blowe for blowe, but meeting very roughly with theyr Shieldes, both horſes &amp; men tumbled all on a heape, and recouering footing againe very hardly, prepared to combate with theyr ſwords: <hi>Francian</hi> and <hi>Pompides</hi> brake their Launces, and drew their weapons for further tryall of manhood.</p>
               <p>The fight grew to ſuch tearmes on either ſide, as the death of ſome of them muſt needes enſue, yet <hi>Palmerin</hi> and his company, remembring that they fought againſt theyr blood and friendes, vſed the more milde and gentle reſpect: but the Knights enchaunted, grew to all extremitie, ſo that euill ſucceſſe muſt one way needes be expected. For, <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendos,</hi> cutting in ſunder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bridle of <hi>Palmerins</hi> horſe, woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him alſo on the left hand very ſhrewdly: which making him forgetfull of his former patience, returned ſuch angry ſtrokes backe againe in requitall, as <hi>Florendos</hi> was ſore hurt on one ſhoulder, and likewiſe on the left ſide. The like hurts paſſed betweene <hi>Florian</hi> and <hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> ſo was <hi>Floraman</hi> wounded in the right arme, and <hi>Oliuanto</hi> in the face, and as much miſhap befell the other foure: the fielde beeing indifferently dyed with their blood, and pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily ſpred with the peeces of broken ſhieldes and mayles of theyr Armour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Floraman</hi> ſtill cryed to thoſe on his part, that they ſhould but onely award theyr aduerſaries ſtrokes, as hoping of help from ſome one quarter or another, that would diſturbe and breake of this fierce conflict: albeit it was nowe an houre and more paſt noone, in all which time they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer reſpited, ſo that eyther ſide was growne ſo wearie and ouer-laboured, as hardlie could they weild theyr weapons with any diſpoſition.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14347:140"/>As thus the caſe continued, ſuddenly at the doore of the Tent, appeared an armed Knight, hauing the beuer of his Helmet lifted vp, who was no ſooner eſpied by the Knights enchaunted, but they made furiouſly toward him, as hoping right ſpeedily to be his death: but herein they found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues much diſappointed, for the nature of the incantation was ſuch, as it wrought not againſt them that came from <hi>Niquea,</hi> but onely ſtoode in force for ſuch as came toward it, for otherwiſe it might haue offended as wel friends as ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. When <hi>Florendos</hi> and his conſorts had better know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their friend, they ranne and embraced him, which <hi>Palmerin</hi> with his part perceiuing, and knowing him for his noble brother and friende, they followed the other in kindnes and embraces, the like did more then an hundred of the chiefeſt Knights in the Armie, who had ſtood all this while beholding the combate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Florendos</hi> and his crew (who firſt ſawe him enter out of the Tent doore) would haue returned in againe with him: but <hi>Aliarte</hi> calling to <hi>Floraman,</hi> willed him, that hee, and the hundred Knights there with him, ſhould ſeaze on the Knights which were enchaunted, to preuent what elſe might happen worſe to them, and afterward he would find the meanes to frée them from the enchauntment. So cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kling them round as in a Ring, they tooke and vnarmed them, dreſſing theyr wounds, which being ſomewhat dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and chilled with cold, made them ſcarce able to ſtir themſelues, and nowe they ſéemed as if they had no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lede one of another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Palmerin</hi> and his companions, had their hurts likewiſe lookt to, for they knew not how ſoone they ſhould haue néed of employment, then cauſed they the Armie to paſſe on by the aduiſe of <hi>Aliarte,</hi> leaſt <hi>Druſa Velonna</hi> ſhoulde worke ſome worſe impeachment, and hinder them from paſſing any further.</p>
               <p>That night, <hi>Aliarte</hi> by certaine of his carracters and ſpells, wrought ſo ſtudiouſly, as hee founde wherein the ſtrength of the enchauntment conſiſted: Whereupon, the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:14347:140"/>
next day, as Knights came ſtill toward the Tent, and were enchaunted for defence thereof againſt all other commers, he cauſed them to be taken and bound, then did he make the earth to be digged in the ſame place, ſo deepe as it might co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

He interpoſing himſelfe with his ſword drawne, had a very ſtrange kinde of fight with the beaſt: for diuers times he was faſt betweene his pawes, and griped with ſuch ſtrong and intollerable pinches, that well might hee doubt the iſſue of his bold enterpriſe.</p>

               <p>When <hi>Blandidon</hi> heard that name, as yet ſo gratefull to all the <hi>Grecian</hi> band of Knights: he let him liue, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauncing him ſelfe to further imployment, entred vpon a fourth part of the Citty, which ſtoode deuided as into foure ſeuerall Citties, with walls, bulwarks, and ditches, and therefore required time to take the whole, part after part. <hi>Gargante</hi> and <hi>Lanfranco,</hi> perceauing the maine aime to be now at the Citty, began to ſhift for them ſelues, both being ſore wounded, for <hi>Palmerin</hi> would neuer ſuffer <hi>Gargante</hi> to be out of his ſight, but turnd and winded him many times

               <p>Héere-vpon the ſiege began at three ſeuerall places, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſtill their entraunce on the quarter where <hi>Blandidon</hi> had preuailed: which (by aduiſe of all the Princes) was daily ſupplied and ſtronger fortified, becauſe <hi>Dirdan</hi> held it as the place of weakeſt ability, and that there hee could controle euen as him ſelfe pleaſed. The next day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Broco,</hi> the other ſonne of <hi>Palurdan,</hi> came foorth verie néere to the Chriſtian campe, in an Armour of Aſh-colour, without any baſes, and the deuiſe in his ſhéeld, was a Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant ſtrangling a Serpent, becauſe him ſelfe being aſſailed by a Serpent, ſtrangled it. Hée excéeded his brother in mightines of ſtature, and becauſe there could be found no Horſe to beare him, he vſed continually to fight on foote.</p>
               <p>The newes of this wondrous Giants approach, was quickly ſpread through all the campe, and <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> (beeing one of the firſt that heard it) preſently armed him ſelfe, and by lycence obtained of his Captaine, ranne vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly againſt him: but when he perceaued the Giant was on foote, and a huge ſtrong Halberd in his hand, turning back his Horſe, he entred his Tent againe, where taking a kéene battell-axe, which hee vſed to beare euer when hee hunted, being diſmounted from his Horſe, he turned coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly toward his enemie, and without any other Drum or warlike noyſe then their owne blowes, they began to hack and hewe one another, ſlicing their Armour off in ſuch large ſcantlings, as their fleſh felt the temper of their kéene edged weapons.</p>

                  <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> taking aduiſed note of this his furious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, receaued thereby the better hope of good ſucceſſe, and therefore helde him play with tracings about, mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging his Axe ſtill with ſuch ſleights &amp; dexterity, that euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more he put by or rebated his blowes, and hauing a ſharpe long pike in the head of his Axe, by vnexpected doubled ſtroakes, often wounded the Giant, renting the Cuiraſſe and fleſh in many places on his left ſide. All which <hi>Broco</hi> ſéemed to make no reckoning of at all, but continued his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and madde manner of fight, till at laſt it was <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſiandes</hi> ill hap, in auoyding a very dangerous blowe of his aduerſarie, to haue the ſtaffe cut in two péeces by the Halberd, ſo that now (perforce) he muſt ſtand breſt to breſt with a deuilliſh enemie, a miſhap which would haue daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a very reſolute ſpirit: but hee chearing his hopes with this comfort, that Chriſtian Knights are moſt admired in extremities, bated not an inch of courage, but kept <hi>Broco</hi> off ſo valiantly with the pike of his Axe, that at length it was his good hap, to ſtab it into the ſight of his helmet, and wounded him iuſt betwéene both the eyes: nowe as great an inconuenience followed this ſucceſſe, for he could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer his Axe backe againe, but was conſtrained, to leaue it there ſticking in his helmet, which loſſe of his weapon did much diſpleaſe him.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding, to make vſe of time (as he thought for his beſt aduantage,) he ranne and caught the Giant about the midſt, of which boldnes he had but little cauſe to boaſt, for <hi>Broco,</hi> whoſe embrace was larger then his by a whole armes length, gaue him ſuch knocks on the helmet with the pommell of his Halberd, as but that it was of excéeding pure temper in déede, he had cleft it, and then you may geſſe the others danger: for with theſe blowes he was ſo giddied and amazed, that if the Giant had had the reaſon but to haue perceaued it, <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> had falne, but that his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie onely ſupported him. Neuertheleſſe, recouering him ſelfe ſo well as he could, while thus the Giant had him within his encloſure, he gaue him ſo many ſtabs with his

dagger in the left flanke, that he was glad to let him goe at liberty: and beſide, he recouered his Axe againe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with hee once more wounded him in the very ſame place, that the iſſue of blood blinding his ſight, made him raue with madneſſe, and runne vp and downe ſtamping like a deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate lunaticke. Then drew he forth his ſword, becauſe in this raging he had loſt his Halberd, and his ſword excéeded <hi>Dramuſiandes</hi> a full yard in meaſure, whereof it ſtoode the other vpon to be wary and circumſpect, becauſe ſuch an ods was beyond all indifferencie: notwithſtanding, <hi>Dramuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ande</hi> auoyded all perrill with good diſcretion, and for anie one wound receaued, returned his enemie thrée.</p>

At which very inſtant, <hi>Oliuanto</hi> fell on his knée before <hi>Palmerin,</hi> who was preſſing forward to be gone, but that the young Knight ſtayed him, ſaying.</p>
               <p>Moſt honourable Lorde and Vnkle, ſuffer me to gaine that glory, which you now goe for, and are certaine to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy: as euer you reſpected chiualrie, or will further the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of a hopefull ſpirit. <hi>Palmerin,</hi> who knew not wel how to gaine-ſay him, graunted his requeſt, ſo trotted hee foorth with his Launce to méete <hi>Lanfranco,</hi> whoſe Beare caried him with ſuch wilde and giddie trauerſes, that the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Knights Horſe ſtartling at ſight of him, caried his Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter amazedly quite thwart the Beares paſſage, whereof <hi>Lanfranco</hi> taking the aduantage, with a croſſe thruſt woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him a little, beſide diſmounted him from his Horſe.

                  <pb facs="tcp:14347:145"/>
with his kéene edgde ſword, wounded the beaſt in both the féete at once, ſo that as the Giant would haue turned him in haſt for better opportunitie, he fell downe on a heape and his Maiſter vnder him, which good hap admitted y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Knight to reuenge his former fall, and to quittance the Giant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide with two hurts, one on the ſhoulder, and the other vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his right arme, albeit they were wounds of ſlender im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, in regard of his mightie ſtature and corpulence of body.</p>
               <p>After that <hi>Lanfranco</hi> had got on foote againe, he layde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him with his long ſworde, that <hi>Oliuanto</hi> had worke enough to doo, by nimble turnings &amp; ſleights to award and defend them: till at length, the Giant beeing a huge bodie, and very vnweldie, found himſelfe ſo ouer-wearied with the Knights actiue windings and abouts, that indeed it tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to his great diſaduantage, for <hi>Oliuanto</hi> by his agil dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teritie, gaue him woundes in ſixe ſeuerall places, though not ſo deepe and mortall as had béene more neceſſary, and his hurts prooued the ſlighter in giuing, becauſe the Knight had care to ſhun the Giants long heauie ſword, the proofe whereof had beene ſo dangerous to him, that it had robbed him of the better part of his Shield, and giuen him (beſide) a wound in the right thigh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> alſo on the other ſide, intreated <hi>Broco</hi> in ſuch ſort, as the victorie twixt them, was moſt apparant on the Chriſtians ſide: but they were both ſo ouer-wearied with fighting, as little harme could they doo to one another with theyr ſwords. <hi>Gargante,</hi> with two noated Knights of the Kingdome of <hi>Paraz,</hi> who were Coſins by affinitie to the reuolted <hi>Dirdan,</hi> came foorth of the Cittie, and grewe ſo forward in theyr bold enterpriſe, that at length they were in hand with <hi>Palmerin</hi> himſelfe, little thinking to be ſo roughly encountred: for the Knight with his Launce, had pierced quite through <hi>Gargantes</hi> armour, &amp; wounded him ſome-what though little to effect, and contrariwiſe, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe was well aſtonied with the ſhocke, albeit, by reaſon of his admired valour, he quickly recouered his ſences again.</p>

               <p>Theſe Ladies, were they of whom we ſpake before, that were carried away by <hi>Druſa Velonna:</hi> but ſhe would not impart ſo much to the Knight, who ſo déerely affected the faire Infant <hi>Victoria,</hi> that ſhould he haue had knowledge of her impriſonment in ſuch ſort: he would haue put off all hope of this enterprized aduenture, and immediatly haue followed the recouerie of his loue: wherefore being aſked of him what Ladies they were, ſhee was glad to aunſwere him, that ſhe could not tell. So ſailed they on ſtill with a proſperous wind, and it happened one day, euen in the very bluſh of the mornings ariſe, the Ship cloſed with the Iſle of Fortune, which preſently he knew, and (not a little <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>After they had likewiſe brought their Horſes on ſhoare, they mounted, and rode on thorowe the wood, vntill they came to the ſelfe ſame place, where <hi>Primaleon</hi> firſt beheld the Trée changed into the forme of a Theater: which as he nowe looked for to finde againe, hee eſpied there a very fearefull grotte or vault, for Fortune was departed from that place, and had made this Cauerne before the track of her foote-ſteps, to ſée who durſt be ſo bold as to follow her. When he came to the mouth of this frightfull hollowe, he felt himſelfe ſuddainly diſpoiled of his Armour, &amp; left there in his doublet with his ſword onely, whereat he grew very highly offended, and ſéeing no way to get thence againe, he beheld a famiſhed Lyon ſtart out of the vaute, the beaſt (lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp his foote to a piller ſtanding there by) ſhewed him this briefe fixed there-vpon.</p>
               <q>Seeke not thy death in this vnhaunted Wood.</q>
               <p>

them, ſtepping boldly to the beaſt, gaue him an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry ſtroke with his ſword on the head, which rebounded back againe as lightly to him, as if he had ſmitten on a rock of marble, whereat the Knight began to meruaile not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. The Lyon caught hold of him about the middle, and caried him ſo ſwiftly into the vault, that the Squire ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by, (fearing when the Lyon had deuoured his maiſter, hee would returne againe and fetch him too:) foorth-with fled thence, leading along with him his Lords horſe, and ſo rode he directly to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> as in more méet place ſhall at large be declared.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Primaleon,</hi> who for all this ſtrange rapture of the beaſt, failed not in the very leaſt iote of his courage, hauing drawn his dagger, thought there-with to wound the Lyon in the throat, but the beaſt (like one poſſeſſed of a reaſonable ſoule) in the voyce of a man thus ſpake vnto him. <hi>My death will be thy deſtruction, becauſe of my blood ſhall ariſe ſo many Lyons more, as thou canſt not defend thy ſelfe againſt them: Permit me then to carry thee to the place, where thy loſt Armes ſhall be reſtored againe vnto thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It ſeemed a matter of no ſlender moment to the Knight, to heare a Lyon ſpeake in this manner, but yet hee helde it much more ſtrange, that he ſhould ſuffer himſelfe to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away in this ſort: neuertheleſſe, not dreading the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of any vile eſteeme, either by neglect of courage, or other behauiour beſt beſeeming a man, hee thus replyed. Carrie me whether thou wilt, for in all occaſions whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer that may happen to me, faire Fortune and mine own valour ſhall ſufficiently defend me.</p>
               <p>The Lyon holding him faſt betwéene his fore-pawes, bare him aboue a miles length through a mightie darknes, vntill at laſt they came to a goodly large plaine, ſo thicke beſet with high ſpreading trées, that they hindred y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſight of a round bright-ſhining Tower neere adioyning, to which the Lyon brought him ſo neere, that he wondred he had no ſooner eſpied it, there did the Lyon ſet him downe, and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly departed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14347:148"/>The Knight not ſéeing any bodie, by whom he might be informed what was there to doe for him, ſtoode ſadly pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering to himſelfe, and hauing ſo continued for a good halfe houres ſpace, yet neuer the neerer of his expectation, hee coaſted about to come to the Caſtell, and more then an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred paces had he ſpent about it, yet could not diſcerne any gate for entrance, but onely diuers high-built windowes, out of which he ſeemed to heare a diſordered noiſe of people, reſembling rather to be of Giants, then ſuch as were of his owne ſtature or proportion.</p>
               <p>Standing doubtfull awhile what hee ſhould doe, two Siluane young men, cirkled and wrethed with Iuie both alike, came ſuddenly before him, and one of them ſpake in manner following. Indiſcréete &amp; ouer-audacious Knight, know that Fortune hath conducted thée hether to thy death. This which thou ſeeſt, is called the <hi>Dreadfull Tower,</hi> for the faire Quéene <hi>Melia,</hi> Siſter to the King <hi>Armato,</hi> who in his ſoule abhorred Chriſtians, and contended in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall Sciences with the wiſe <hi>Vrgando,</hi> erected this tower where thou ſéeſt it ſtand, the place all ſolitary and vnfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented, and circkled with ſuch a powerful enchauntment, that whatſoeuer Chriſtian dares to enter it, immediatly he falls downe dead, except hee firſt be poſſeſſed of the meanes, to make voyde and of none account this incantation, which wee eſtéeme to be impoſſible, becauſe many Knights haue alreadie come hether, and ſuffered themſelues to be carried into the Tower, (as annon thou ſhalt ſée by vs the maner how) and died ſo ſoone as they ſet foote within it, whereof leaſt thou ſhouldeſt make any doubting, looke in that large ditch vpon thy left hand, and ſee the bones of the dead that héere haue perriſhed.</p>
               <p>No ſooner had hee thus ſpoken, but a ſtrange kinde of Tunne or Dryfat deſcended downe the Tower, whereon the two Siluanes preſently mounted, and in a trice were rapt vppe immediatly. This meruaile made <hi>Primaleon</hi> to ſtudie a little one it, but yet feareleſſe of it, or any thing els whatſoeuer, he walked on againe about the Tower, to try
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:14347:148"/>
if hee could finde any helpe for the finiſhing of this aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. As thus he went on, hee heard the treading of a man directly before him, yet could diſcerne nothing at all, but a great yron Sledge lying iuſt in his way, which he helde to be very conuenient for his purpoſe, either for compaſſing his entrance into the Tower, or for expelling ſuch as hee ſhould finde within it.</p>
               <p>So taking vp the hammer, which ſéemed to him to be very weightie, he beganne to knock there-with againſt the wall, with as loude ſtrokes as a Smith vppon his Anuile, and the wall being of bright ſhining mettall, deliuered ſuch a ſtrange high kind of ſound, that the beaſts which were in the wood néere adioyning, hearing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> noiſe, fled thence with feare.</p>
               <p>The wall (with his long battering vpon it) began to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen a little, but not to any purpoſe for entrance, albeit (by the rift) it appeared not aboue a fingers bredth in thicknes: nor could he make any larger rupture, notwithſtanding he vſed his very vtmoſt ſtrength, and laboured till he was all on a ſweate, when ſuddainly he ſaw the Tunne deſcend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and out of it ſtarted a huge Giant, with his face like a dogges, and of horrible ſtature, not hauing any vſe of ſpéech, therefore his language was barking onely. As hee was going toward him, one of the young Siluanes deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againe, crying aloude to the Giant, that he ſhould ſtay, whereon he preſently ſtoode ſtill, and the young man being come to the ground, went to the Knight with theſe ſpéeches. Sir, the feare of your perrill by this monſter, dooth much afflict me, for this is a Caniball, a people of that part of the world, where the <hi>Antipodes</hi> are, and fifty ſuch as he is, are within the Tower, with all which you muſt hazard your ſelfe, if you abide there.</p>
               <p>Quéene <hi>Melia</hi> fetcht them from that Countrey to this place, enchaunting them in ſuch a ſort, as they cannot die till the Tower be taken: all which may ſéeme no more then a ieſt in the eye of your valour, but farre greater dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers will aſſaile ye, then you are aware of. This ſpake the
<pb facs="tcp:14347:149"/>
young man, as thinking with great wordes to ſende him thence: but euer when the Knight ſtrooke on the wall, the Siluane trembled, doubting leaſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aduenture would now he concluded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Primaleon</hi> remembring he was vnarmed, conſulted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while with his thoughts, whether he ſhould deale with this ſtrange creature thus hand to hand, or ſtay in expectation of his Armour, which (as you haue heard before) was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed him againe. As thus hee ſtoode muſing, there came forth of the woode a Knight in yellowe coloured Armour, with a border or liſt or blacke about it, in his Shielde was a hammer or ſledge as his deuiſe, and <hi>Primaleons</hi> Armour he bare vpon a Launce, in manner as Trophies are borne before Conquerours, and beeing come to him, hee ſaid. Heere Knight, take your Armour, and this young man ſhall helpe to arme yée: as for my ſelfe, expect no fauour at my hands, but fierceſt hatred. Neuertheleſſe, I will not ſee you in any ſuch perrill, that you may haue any iuſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe to colour your vanquiſhing, and hauing thus ſaide, he parted thence againe.</p>
               <p>The young man (with lookes full of gréefe) foorth-with armed him, &amp; then was quickly drawne vp into the tower. When <hi>Primaleon</hi> ſaw himſelfe armed ſo ſoone, hee wiſhed to haue preſent dealing with the Caniballs, rather then to looſe time againſt that one, and aduauncing his weapon, went to aſſaile him, thinking to kil him at the very firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter: but he found himſelfe deceiued, for the Giant, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit he was vnarmed, had ſuch a maſſie Clubbe, as would endure againſt the keeneſt edgde ſword, without any har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming: beſide, hee was ſo quicke and nimble, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Knight ſpent many ſtroakes in vaine, before he could wound him. Which when he perceiued, he began to make better vſe of his labour, and watching apt occaſion for his owne aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, ſtriking at the vpper hand that held the Club, cut it quite off: ſo the Giant was nowe both without hande and Clubbe, which made him runne rauingly vpon the Knight, and thinking to murder him, bit gréedily his Armour, but
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:14347:149"/>
to little purpoſe, for <hi>Primaleon</hi> gaue him ſo many ſtabs, that at laſt he fell downe for dead at his foote, and then he tooke vp the hammer againe, beating therewith on the wall, as he did before, which ſéemed to open wider then it did, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though indeed it was very little, neuertheleſſe it ſomewhat increaſed his comfort.</p>
               <p>While thus hee ſtood beating againſt the wall, two Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants were let downe together out of the Tower, and they came very ſuddenly vpon the Knight, who was ſo extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie wearied with lifting the hammer, that one would haue thought he had beene dead: for the one gaue him a mightie ſtroke vpon the Helmet, and the other ſmote him ſo ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon the right ſhoulder, that he ſtaggerd and réeled from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aboue twenty paces. But recouering his ſpirits quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and perceiuing two ſuch fierce enemies vpon him at once, he brauely buckled to them, and ran one of them with his ſword through the right ſide: at the other hee reached a ſlaunting ſtroke, which hee very well auoyded with his Club, and returned him ſuch a requitall vpon his Shield, as if it had not béene that belonging to Fortune, it would haue béene ſquandred in many péeces.</p>
               <p>Now was he beſet with much extremitie, and indéed had falne into vnreſiſtable perrill, but that good hap ſo well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friended him, as from the one hee ſmote of his doggs head, and the other (béeing wounded before) had little abilitie of defending himſelfe, but fell downe dead after his fellowe. This ſucceſſe made him ſo deſirous of entrance into the Towre, that againe he ran to his hammer, and charging the wall with no ſimple ſtrokes, beheld a farre larger ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the breach: but he ſaw it defended by thrée furious Caniballs, which from the Towers toppe were let downe on the other ſide, and they with huge Maces ſtood rayſing vp the wall againſt him.</p>
               <p>But he whoſe deſire was on nothing but victory, ſeeing them to be vnarmed as the other were before, threwe his hammer at one of them, which breaking his bulke, made him fall downe dead: then with his ſword he recouered the
<pb facs="tcp:14347:150"/>
ſledge againe, and ſpurned it by him, not willing to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſt thereof as yet, becauſe he expected good ſucceſſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, he cleft another of them from the ſhoulder to the bellie, and he fell downe as ſpred in two part. The third ſhewed himſelfe ſo gallantly diſpoſed, that <hi>Primaleon</hi> (beholding the night to haſt vpon him) doubted leaſt he ſhould be moſt troubled with this Caniball: and looking vp to the toppe of the Tower, hee ſawe a number of them ſtand barking at him, which made him the leſſe reckon what his enemie could doe, but doubling his ſtroakes couragiouſly vpon him, at laſt he fell downe dead among the other.</p>
               <p>Nowe began all the Caniballs aloft on the Tower, to howle and cry in very fearefull manner, becauſe this laſt Caniball which <hi>Primaleon</hi> had ſlaine, had there his Wife and eyghteene children, who would all haue deſcended ſnarling together to reuenge their Fathers death in theyr doggiſh furie: but the Knight before ſpoken of, who (albeit inuiſibly) brought him the hammer, came againe out of the wood, and made ſuch a ſigne to the Giants aboue, that they left whyning, and with-drew themſelues, then ſtepping to <hi>Primaleon,</hi> thus hee ſpake. Although the nature of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chauntment be ſuch, that no kindnes or curteſie ſhould bee ſhewne vnto you, neuertheleſſe, Fortune reſeruing you to more glorious enterpriſes, commaunds me to bridle all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, and not to vſe you as in iuſt rage I might: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw your ſelfe therefore into that little Cottage, and there you ſhall finde what is conuenient for you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Primaleon</hi> feeling the laſt Caniballs blowes moſt offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue to him, the more gladlie yéelded to this inuiting, and being entred the Cottage, hee found there a table daintilie furniſhed, and a goodly bed for him to reſt in: there ſupt he without any dread of ſuſpition, and ſeeing none to hinder him, went afterward to bed, and there ſlept ſoundly.</p>

               <p>Now in this idle loytering from the exerciſe of military imployment, a ſofter temper had beleagerd his affections, and carrying them in doating errour toward fayre <hi>Candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Beliſart,</hi> prouoked him to diuers priuate viſitations of her: all which notwithſtanding, the diſcréete and fayre natured Empreſſe <hi>Grydonia,</hi> (neuer minding the becks, nodds, and other ceremonies of an olde enamoured huſband,) deliuered apparantly that ſhee diſcerned no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, whereat the Emperour was not a little contented, albeit he would not for all his Empire, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the world knew his vaine deſires, as his in very deede Empreſſe did.</p>

               <p>Right royall and my moſt eſteemed Lord, by the vertue of that loue which you truly declared, when deliuering mée your ſword, and laying your head on my lappe, you proſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted your ſelfe to death, and bad me reuenge my wrongs for <hi>Perequin</hi> of <hi>Durace:</hi> let me intreate you to forget theſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and liue with me in honours league as you ought to doe. Admit you haue loſt a noble Nephew, yet comfort your ſelfe in <hi>Oliuanto</hi> his brother, &amp; doubtleſſe his Mother will alſo be well recouered againe: for aſſurance whereof, take this as a teſtimonie, that in the heauieſt and moſt diſconſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late afflictions of all, the Diuine fauour preſerued and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored you to your Empire.</p>
               <p>The Emperour beeing come to better patience, was ſo inwardly comforted with theſe pleaſing ſpeeches, that folding her in his armes, hee declared himſelfe to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly ſatiſ-fied: commaunding all the other Ladies and young Princeſſes to his preſence, with whom hee ſate diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing on matters beſeeming theyr aſſembly, the better to expell theſe ſad tydings which ſo much afflicted him, yet the death of his déere Nephew often interpoſing it ſelfe, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled many broken (yet well ſhadowed ſighes) which (ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe) the Empreſſe with heedfull eye obſerued, and
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:14347:151"/>
made her very hardly to refraine from teares. But nowe the houre of dinner beeing come, a generall feaſting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the hall was commaunded: whereto the Emperour was the rather induced, becauſe hee helde it as a matter woorth generall reſpect, that a Knight ſo fauoured of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and ſo full of fayre hopes, ſhould ſo vntimely be tane away, euen in the freſheſt flouring of his youth.</p>
               <p>This dinner was very ſumptuous, and honourably per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, in which time, many iocond humours and fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies ranne in the Emperours thoughts, that he could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beleeue his Nephew was dead: and dinner beeing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, hee called to him ſundry Princes of good yeeres, to whom he imparted his priuate oppinion, which ſauouring as likely in their coniectures as his, they fell to this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, that the Squire ſhould be deliuered ouer to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, thereby to vnderſtand the truth of his Maiſters death.</p>
               <p>So without any long delaying, hee was taken and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in ſuch ſort, that hee confeſſed the reaſon of his ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, was, becauſe hee thought him for certaintie to be dead, and in excuſe of his owne returning thether without him: for how could it be otherwiſe? his eyes were witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, how a Lyon carried him into a deepe vaulte, againſt which beaſt he could not well defend himſelfe, his Armour being before taken from him at the Tree of Fortune. The Emperour aduertiſed the Empreſſe heereof, and ſending kindly to entreate her company, ſo ſoone as ſhe came, thus he began.</p>
               <p>Madame, cherriſh your good hopes, for queſtionleſſe my Nephew is liuing: for I dare affirme (according to ſome Magicall incantations, which I haue both ſeene and heard of,) that the Lyon is ſo friendly a beaſt to the progenie of <hi>Palmerin,</hi> that this carriage away of our Nephew by a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, will ſort in the end to his fame and glory.</p>
               <p>Now began all former ſad oppinions to be quite bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and nothing but courtly pleaſures onely proſecuted: but ſée a ſuddaine vnexpected change againe, <hi>Franardos</hi>

               </p>
               <p>This freſh allarum of vnfortunate tydings, raiſed ſuch a new diſcontent in the Court, that nowe they began to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite the former report, comparing preſent ſucceſſes with paſſed accidents: that Fortune now ſtroue to weaken the Court of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and reduce it into the like deſperate eſtate, as when <hi>Don Edward</hi> the Prince of <hi>England</hi> was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned: but this new croſſe ſtoode on farre worſe conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by reaſon theſe Knights could not be deliuered, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the intended death of <hi>Leonato,</hi> which admitted no hope in ſo hard an extremitie, but rather cauſed a more confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in griefe generally thorow the Court.</p>
               <p>The Empreſſe outſtanding the firſt affliction, with more then manly courage, being aſſaulted now againe with ſuch a waightie oppreſſion, could no longer containe her former diſpoſition, but lauiſhly ſent foorth a whole Sea of teares, and the Emperour likewiſe fell downe halfe deade with griefe: ſo that the Cittie was in ſuch a ſad turbulence, for the loſſe of ſo many famous Princes, as it neere hand now reſembled an vnfrequented deſert place, all bemoaning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely <hi>Trineus</hi> the Emperour of <hi>Allmaignes</hi> departure, and the wanting of the other flouriſhing companie, for if nowe an Armie had ſet vpon <hi>Constantinople,</hi> it had béen no matter of difficultie to take it, beeing thus diſpoſſeſſed of all her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders.</p>
               <p>Theſe gréefes growing to more diſcréete moderation, and the Emperour (making a better recollection of his thoughts) beganne to conſider, that the ſtrongeſt inchaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which in thoſe times could happen, did but giue ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant

               <p>In which reſolution, hée chéered vp the Ladyes young and olde, but <hi>Polinarda</hi> the mother of <hi>Leonato,</hi> and fayre <hi>Candida,</hi> (who was deepely enamoured of him,) they could take little truce with theyr teares, and the heauier was this croſſe to the other Princeſſes, who albeit theyr ſonnes were priſoners, and nature made them as deſirous of their libertie, yet none of them woulde purchaſe the ſame at ſo deere a rate, as to buy her ſonnes life with <hi>Lenatos</hi> death. The Emperour ſéeing himſelfe thus left alone, and the Empire ſtanding on tearmes of hazard, if any hoſtile ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſhould ariſe againſt it: wrote to <hi>Don Edward</hi> then King of <hi>England,</hi> that hée ſhould bring what power he could with him to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> for the better withſtanding all dangers what-ſoeuer: but he did not acquaint him with the caſe of <hi>Primaleon,</hi> neyther the diſaſter allotted to <hi>Leonato,</hi> becauſe hée might iourney the more contentedly.</p>

                  <hi>Blandidon,</hi> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this caſe did moſt of all concerne, would haue his Siſter put into the hand of iuſtice, and puniſhed as her offence had worthily deſerued: vpon which opinion he ſtoode ſo peremptorily, that <hi>Palmerin</hi> grew ſome-what diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed thereat, but <hi>Floraman</hi> being diſcréete and wiſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned <hi>Blandidon</hi> this aunſwer.

               <p>
                  <hi>Blandidon</hi> knew not howe to aunſwere this ſentence, perceauing how euery one leaned to that courſe, therefore it being thus concluded on, and wanting but execution, ſo

ſoone as <hi>Pompides</hi> was well of his hurts receaued, with two hundred for her guard, they were diſpatched thence to <hi>Tubante,</hi> where afterwarde they ſhould embarque them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues for <hi>Constantinople.</hi> In their marching, they were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned farre off from the Citty, and <hi>Dragonalte</hi> (being on the chiefeſt Turret) not well acquainted with the Scottiſh Armes they beare, armed him ſelfe to preuent the woorſt, going more then halfe a mile out of the Citty to méet them, where knowing each other, and kindly embracing, as they walked on, <hi>Pompides</hi> reported the whole ſucceſſe of the warre, as alſo the preſent caſe concerning <hi>Tirrena,</hi> and how ſhe ſhould be ſent to <hi>Constantinople.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus paſſed they along into the Citty, where <hi>Targiana</hi> awayted their comming, with longing deſire, to heare ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinges of the Chriſtian Princes, but moſt of all of noble <hi>Florian.

So full of gréefe did theſe newes make <hi>Targiana,</hi> that ſhee was ready to fall downe dead, but bearing it out (with a good ſpirit) ſo long as ſhee could, at laſt ſhee tooke leaue of the Knights, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing into her priuate chamber, where giuing more ſcope to her hearts oppreſſion, ſhee remembred the hatred which <hi>Druſa Velonna</hi> bare to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Chriſtians, holding it now for moſt certaine, that ſhe had thus caried away thoſe La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, to endaunger the Knights by ſome helliſh enchaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and knew not héerein how to comfort her ſelfe.</p>

But Fortune, the daily enemie to the very leaſt quietnes, wrought in ſuch ſort, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Monſter (which was taken before by our Knights, when they combatted the Kings that came with <hi>Riſtorano</hi>) had laboured ſo ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſefully with his ſharpe nailes, that the ſtrong giues were broken which bound him faſt by the féete: beſide, he had

wrenched out the yrons which grated the window, where <hi>Riſtorano</hi> was kept priſoner with too much courteſie, for he was neither manackled on hands nor féete: and then paſſing ſo on together, thorow doore and doore, they came at laſt to the vttermoſt, which (by good hap) they found open, and not guarded at all, where <hi>Riſtorano</hi> aſſuring him ſelfe now on liberty, gaue ſignes to the Monſter to be very quiet. So eſcaped they thence to a kindſman of his, whom he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had acquainted with his meanes of fréedome, hoping that but fewe Chriſtians were as then in <hi>Tubante,</hi> (for hee knew nothing of <hi>Pompides</hi> arriuall) and now was the time for the deliuerance of his Countrey.</p>
               <p>But his kindſman, hauing already ſéene the two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred valiant Souldiours when they came, and a Captaine of ſo woorthy reputation withall, ſtoode a while doubtfull what were beſt to be done: but being ouer-weyed with <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoranos</hi> bold ſpéeches, he would néedes make venter of his fortune, and dealing cloſely with tenne other of principall reckoning (ſecret ſworne enemies to the Chriſtians) they wrought with ſuch politique ſubtilty, that they were aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of two thouſand Turkes in their aſſiſtaunce, making this courſe their hope, that if a tumult were ſuddainly rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, they ſhould want no harts nor hands to help them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Riſtorano</hi> (with his elected company) went to the place where he had left the Monſter, and engirting the Pallace where the Chriſtian Caualierie were, (onely ſuch excepted as guarded the gates and kept the Caſtell) crying out, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, murder, murder the falſe Chriſtians: they forcibly brake through the doores where the Knights lodged, and there had ſuddainly murdered them all, but that the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter (ouer-gréedy in his forwardnes) ſhooke the doore of the roome where <hi>Dragonalte</hi> &amp; <hi>Pompides</hi> ſlept. Now was there heard ſuch a terrible noiſe, as if the Pallace had béen ſhatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in péeces, ſo that the Princes awaking, &amp; their Armour euermore by them, they were immediatly armed: <hi>Targiana</hi> likewiſe armed her ſelfe, &amp; perceauing ſhee could repoſe no truſt in her Turkes, hence-forth would ſecure her ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

the Chriſtians. Thirty of the beſt knights in the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace were ſpéedily in a readines, &amp; fifty more came by a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret vault vnder the Caſtel to them: <hi>Dragonalte</hi> with theſe foureſcore reſolutes, hauing left <hi>Targiana</hi> in <hi>Pompides</hi> charge, with twelue of her beſt affected ſeruants in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, all vowing to looſe their liues in her defence: went on to the gate, where néeded no labour to open it, for the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter had made ſo large an entrance, that our men might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily ruſh forth vpon them, but the Monſter could not get in thereat, being only hindered by his huge greatnes. When <hi>Dragonalte</hi> beheld ſuch a wide rupture, which (though the night was dark) he too plainly perceaued, he imagined ſuch a breache could not poſſibly be made, but doubtleſſe it was the Monſter that did it, wherefore, holding it not requiſite, to reſpect a beaſt with manly curteſie, he cauſed thrée Laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to be bounde together, becauſe the Monſter had ſuch ſtrength in his hands, as with eaſe he could cracke one in péeces: and as the beaſt ſtoode crouding for entrance, he ran with the Launces againſt his ſide ſo ſtrongly, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> gaſhing his ribs, it rent away a good deale of his fleſh.

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14347:155"/>Our Caualieres with their handy blows had ſo diſharte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the formoſt rancks, that with very good will they gaue them paſſage, and (thereby) releaſt their paſſage into the open Court, where being ſeconded with new ſupplies of freſh friends, and comfort of others which were in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes preparing, the enemy made a preſent recuile out again, ſo that there might be eaſily numbred two thouſand ſlaine, euen in this forcible retire of the enemie and his troups.</p>
               <p>The Monſter being ſtarke mad with the wound he had receaued, ranne thorowe the Citty, ouerthrowing and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling all that he met withall, making ſuch a confuſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them which fauoured <hi>Riſtoranos</hi> procéedings, as ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie many of them (growing doubtfull what ſucceſſe would enſue) drew back cloſely into their houſes, as fearing now to be held rebellious, by reaſon wherof, <hi>Riſtorano</hi> made not his part ſo good as before he hoped of: neuertheleſſe, very fiercely and deſperatly he maintained ſtill the fight, and the Monſter returning againe where he was, crowde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Pompides</hi> ſéeing ſuch damage done to his men, came in perſon to encounter him, but the Monſter running at him with all his might, thwarted his paſſage ſo vnluckily, that tumbling his Horſe and him quite ouer backward, the beaſt fell likewiſe vppon him, and there (with his huge waight) he had béene preſſed to death, but the Monſter (hauing loſt much blood out of his ſide and other hurts) fell faintly beſide him, when <hi>Pompides,</hi> hauing quickly recouered footing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, commaunded him to be taken by méere ſtrength.

               <p>
                  <hi>Pompides</hi> being very weary, and ſomewhat ſore with his vnhappy fall, meeting with <hi>Carino,</hi> had there by him beene ſlaine, if <hi>Targianaes</hi> good hap had not conducted her thether, attended by her twelue faithfull followers: where beholding her ſtate and rule in a very deſperate hazard, if our Knights of repute ſhould ſo be diſcomfited, both ſhe and they fought ſo gallantly, clearing their way with ſuch va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour before them, as they ſaued <hi>Pompides</hi> life, euen in the narroweſt perill, and brought him where he might breathe and reſt him ſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dragonalte</hi> (on the other ſide) labourd with ſuch ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, that whereſoeuer he ſmote about him, at euery ſtroke it coſt a life: neuertheleſſe, the enemie came ſtill ſo freſhly vpon them, that euery moment their ruine was expected. But <hi>Targiana,</hi> like an aduiſed and prouident Princeſſe, hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping where moſt néede required with new ſupplies, cried out all the way as ſhe went with her troupes, that who ſo euer had taken Armes againſt her in the fauour of <hi>Riſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> if now they would forſake him, and witneſſe true duty to their lawfull Princeſſe, frée pardon was graunted, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any after remembrance of their paſſed offences, ſo that euery one might ſafely betake him to his abiding.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Targiana</hi> was reputed ſo faithfull of her promiſe (as indéede it becommeth any Prince to be,) as therefore ſhée deſerued highly to be reuerenced: and (except the kindred or néere friends of <hi>Riſtorano</hi> and <hi>Carino</hi>) all the reſt depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted preſently to their habitations, ſo that thoſe two Princes were there left nowe, with not aboue an hundred men to helpe them. When <hi>Dragonalte</hi> ſaw the people part thence in ſuch ſort, he ſpent no time in vaine againſt the ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder,
<pb facs="tcp:14347:156"/>
yet <hi>Riſtorano</hi> and <hi>Carino</hi> were withdrawne to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and ſtoode vpon their owne guard with very ſpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly courage: but when <hi>Pompides</hi> and <hi>Targiana</hi> came with freſh enforcement vpon them, then they began to think the day loſt, and <hi>Carino,</hi> who meaned to be impriſoned no more, leaping foorth of the circkle wherein he was round engirt, ranne into the thickeſt of the Chriſtian ſquadron, calling with loude voyce for <hi>Dragonalte</hi> and <hi>Pompides,</hi> that hee might die by the hand of one of them. But becauſe a Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour deſerues no honourable end, ſuch was the loude clat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of ſwords vpon Armour, and the out-cries of them which were doone round about him to death, as he was not heard at all, but falling downe among an hundred Laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, was there very cruelly ſlaine by them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Riſtorano</hi> defended him ſelfe ſo well as he could, hauing no more then twelue men now left with him, for the reſt were departed to their houſes, as loath to looſe their liues and poſſeſſions: but <hi>Targiana</hi> hauing round ringd him with her power, conſidered with her ſelfe, that if he ſhould yéeld, and be ſent thence to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> the Emperour was ſo benigne and full of clemencie, that (in time) his life and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty might be graunted, whereof would ariſe a following affliction to the Turkiſh eſtate: therefore, to preuent ſuch an after daunger, ſhee ſet vpon him with forty of her beſt Souldiours, and there cut him in an hundred péeces, with all the other that ſtoode in his defence, and thus the hurley burley was concluded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dragonalte</hi> and <hi>Pompides</hi> ſummoning their troupes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, found that they had loſt three hundred men, which could not but be ſome gréefe vnto them: neuertheleſſe, they were content that the rebels ſhould be pardoned, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there was no aſſurance in holding of the Kingdome. So order being giuen for regard of the wounded, and good watch appointed for the Citties ſafety, the Captaines and Commaunders went to haue their hurtes dreſt: the like did <hi>Targiana,</hi> who albeit ſhe were wounded, yet grew ſhe ſo affectionate to the following of Armes, as quite giuing
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:14347:156"/>
ouer the néedle and diſtaffe, ſhee would trie the fortune of ſword and Launce like a warrionneſſe, and became famous for chiualry, as héereafter ſhall be ſhewne.</p>
               <p>The next day following, the Princes held a counſell to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to ſend <hi>Tirrena</hi> and the Monſter to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and prouiding a Shippe ready for ſuch a ſeruice, ſent them a boorde, committing the truſt thereof to <hi>Mirante,</hi> the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phewe of <hi>Maulerino,</hi> who went the more willingly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would make him ſelfe knowne to the Emperour. The Ship ſet ſaile, hauing therein Letters from <hi>Floraman</hi> the Generall, with others from the Princes and <hi>Targiana,</hi> which gaue intelligence of all ſucceſſes and occaſions, euen to that inſtant.</p>
               <p>Nowe began no little ioy thorowe the whole Court, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially for ſo happy an attayning to knowledge, in whoſe cuſtodie <hi>Miragarda, Victoria,</hi> and <hi>Argentina</hi> were, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at <hi>Oniſtalda</hi> her mother much reioyced. The Monſter was generally beheld with wonder, becauſe no ſuch ſight had beene vſuall to them, and <hi>Mirante</hi> had royall welcome of the Emperour, remembring what his Graundſire had doone in fauour of his Father, and this ioy qualified the gréefe for the former ill tidings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tirrena</hi> was deliuered to the change of the Empreſſe, who kept kinde company with her in her owne lodging, without her enduring any other diſcontentment, but that ſhe might not part thence at her owne pleaſure.</p>

                  <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Rineus</hi> the <hi>Allmaigne</hi> Emperour, who parted with the Armie from <hi>Constantinople,</hi> to goe for <hi>Tubante,</hi> when he had ſailed diuers dayes with contrary windes, there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe at laſt ſuch a furious tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, that the Shippes (for feare of breaking one againſt another,) were glad to make way as beſt they could. <hi>Trineus</hi> ſorry to ſée the Seas diſtemper, was ſuddainly caried farre off from the Fléete, and borne away with ſuch celerity, that a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie neuer did flie ſwifter from a bowe, ſéeming to him, as if he had in ſhort while diſpatched ſixe dayes ſayling together. At length the Shippe entred a port made onely by nature, and caſting Anker where moſt conueniently they might, <hi>Trineus</hi> was the firſt that would ſtep a ſhoare, being follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed by three other Knights of his owne Nation.</p>
               <p>Paſſing on long, there was neyther trée, hearbe, nor plant to be ſéene, but onely vaſt and naked grauell, which led on directly to a great water, wherein there appeared to be both men and women, who ſeemed as if they knewe not how to liue vpon land, and on the bancks that encloſed this water, grew certaine little grafts or trées, the fruite whereof was like to Quinces, but much leſſe and very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle indéede, yet paſſing pleaſant and nouriſhing in taſt.</p>
               <p>This Countrey ſéemed to <hi>Trineus</hi> commodious enough, and dreadleſſe of any harme to harbour there, he put off his helmet, ſo did the other that were with him, to refreſh them ſelues with the ſwéet ayre. Standing to ſolace them ſelues
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:14347:157"/>
by this water, there ſuddainly came on the further ſide a huge number of wilde beaſts, as Lyons, Beares, wolues, Tygers, Panthers, and other ſuch like: and becauſe there was no other water in the Iland for them to drinke of, the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they came alwaies to quench their thirſt. <hi>Trineus</hi> was not tardy in clapping on his Helmet, nor y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other Knights neither, to defend themſelues from violence, but ſuch reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance was of no reckoning, for there were aboue thirtie thouſand of the beaſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Trineus</hi> béeing of an vndaunted courage, made little care of ſo imminent a perril: but ſuch was the ſubtile quality of the enchauntment, conſiſting on the other ſide of the riuer, that a little boate came floating toward him, guided by a goodly Damoſell, who ſpake vnto him in this manner. My Lady and Miſtreſſe, beholding (a farre off) your comming hether, intreates you to come and ſée her, that ſhe may giue you ſuch inſtructions, as may make your vertues for euer immortall.</p>
               <p>Theſe laſt wordes carried ſuch weight in the thoughts of young <hi>Trineus,</hi> that without returning any aunſwere, both hee and the other Knights ſtept into the boate, béeing conuaied thence with vnſpeakable ſpéede: and they beheld the men and women in the water, expreſſing very paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and mournfull geſtures, as ſignifying that they were carried to ſome fatall miſery. <hi>Trineus,</hi> not regarding theſe ſignes of gréefe at all, ſtept foorth on the other ſhoare, and preſently was ſurprized with ſuch paſſion, that hee muſt néedes caſt himſelfe headlong into the water: and indeede he had doone, but for a Iewell he had about him, giuen him by his Aunte <hi>Bazilia,</hi> which defended him from the force of the enchauntment: but the other thrée Knights that went with him, threw themſelues into the water, where they ſtoode diſpoiled of their Armour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Trineus</hi> much lamented the loſſe of his companions, but remembring the vertue of his Iewell, comforted himſelfe thereby: becauſe (it fréeing him from any magicall oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) chéered his hopes with likely perſwaſions, that hee
<pb facs="tcp:14347:158"/>
might accompliſh this ſtrange aduenture. So going on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, he came where the Sorcereſſe had taken out of the water two fayre young women, to traine him (as was her cuſtome) to luſt and dalliance, then ſhould they tumble in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the flood againe: where looſing all former remembrance (of what-ſoeuer they had knowledge of) to that inſtant, they could not declare what had happened to them by the Enchauntreſſe.</p>
               <p>This comming thether of <hi>Trineus,</hi> was ſo diſpleaſing to the Witch, that ſhee ſtarted vp on foote, and forgetting to caſt the young Women into the water againe, ſhe came to <hi>Trineus</hi> with theſe words. Thou raſh and too bolde aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous Knight, ouer-late wilt thou repent this foole-hardie enterpriſe: then ſuddainly with-drawing herſelfe into a Tower, ſhée ſo plyed her ſpells and helliſh exorciſmes, that immediatly all the ayre was couered with darknes, with ſuch terrible breakes of thunder and flaſhes of lightning, as if the whole world ſhould foorth-with haue béene ruined. At the firſt, <hi>Trineus</hi> began to be a little daunted, but when hée called to minde, howe the Emperour <hi>Primaleon</hi> had often told him, that enchauntments (in their firſt apparition) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered foorth ſeares, but afterward would ſort meerely to nothing, hee concluded to ſee the end of what-ſoeuer might happen.</p>
               <p>The two young Women, who had recouered theyr for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer vnderſtanding, by reaſon the Witch forgot to throwe them into the water againe, accoſted <hi>Trineus,</hi> reporting to him the baſe laſciuious life, wherein the Sorcereſſe ſpent all her daies, ſhée being deſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of <hi>Malfada</hi> the Enchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe, that was ſlaine by nob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Come what may (replyed <hi>Trineus</hi>) for the exerciſe of a dreadleſſe courage, I ſhall be readie (through Diuine aſſiſtance) to award the very vttermoſt, therefore I care not, come what can.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:14347:158"/>Now beganne the ayre to cléere it ſelfe againe, and the ſtorme and rough winde was more mildly calmed, when the Damoſell, which before receiued <hi>Trineus</hi> into the boat, comming once more to him, thus ſpake. The powerfull Lady <hi>Dircea</hi> my gracious Miſtreſſe, taking kinde compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on thy towardly youth, giues thée to vnderſtand by mee, that if thou wilt depart hence with thy company, thou ſhalt be ſafely brought to thy ſcattered Nauie: ſo ſhalt thou fréely eſcape the ineuitable daungers, included in thys paſt-compare enchauntment, which to bring to a full period or concluſion, the whole race of <hi>Palmerin</hi> are not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiicient.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Trineus</hi> gathering by theſe ſpéeches, that the Hag grew fearefull of her enchauntments ending, boldly thus aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. Signifie from me to thy Lady and Miſtreſſe, that I haue ſet downe my lifes reſt and final determination, but I will breake through her deuilliſh charmes and coniura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, detaining ſo many Knights and Ladies in ſo wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched a ſtate of life, onely to pleaſe and glut there-with her owne ſenſuall appetite.</p>
               <p>No ſooner was the Damoſell returned backe to the Tower, but a mightie yron doore was heard to open, and that with ſuch a dreadfull roaring, as if it had béene a long rowle of thunder, after which, iſſued foorth of the Tower the ſtrangeſt miſhapen Monſter, that euer any eye before had beheld: for to the girdle-ſted he ſéemed like a man, but in ſuch wondrous ſort altered and deformed, as no wilde beaſt could be more fierce and hideous: his téeth ſtoode out like the tuſhes of a ſaluage Boare, but much more ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched foorth in length, and backe turning againe at the ends thereof: his armes verie huge, and extreamely ſtrong, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for his weapon, a long ſharpe poynted Forke made of yron on one of his ſhoulders: and his féete were armed with ſuch horrible crooked bending tallents, as they could little he differed from thoſe of a Griffon: beyond all this, hee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be very ſpéedy of foote, and moſt agile and readie to performe the intended combate.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14347:159"/>
                  <hi>Trineus</hi> beholding a ſhape of ſuch ſtrangeneſſe, making the ſigne of the Croſſe on his breaſt, and aduauncing his Shield for his defence, ſtoode to defend what this deformed Monſter durſt doe: who lifting vppe his tridented forke, ſtrooke it quite thorow his Shielde, and the blowe falſing along his pouldrone, wounded him a little in the arme.</p>
               <p>The Knight learning heerby the Monſters fortitude and ſtrength, purpoſed to ward his charges with nimble ſlights of defence, ſo that hauing a more heedfull eye to his blows, hee breathed him well about with ſhifts and eſcapes: yet could he not auoyde a hurt now and then: for the Monſter was ſo readie in his turnes euery way, and ſo ſkilfull in handling of his Forke, as it ſtoode the Knight vpon to bee very circumſpect, if he meant to preſerue both his life and honour, neuertheleſſe, hee gaue the Monſter a ſhrewd wound in the left hand. Whereat he waxing very ſpleene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, ſtabbing the fangges of the forke into the earth, hee grapled and caught <hi>Trineus</hi> by the ſhoulder, griping him ſo ſtrongly with his ſharpe tallents, that bruſing his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour very much, hee made him feele extreame affliction, both with his huge weight and forcible pinching, for eaſe whereof, the Knight thruſt his ſword at him, but the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter graſping faſt holde vppon it, leaping lightly off from him, bare away the ſword with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Trineus</hi> hauing thus loſt his weapon, caught vp the Forke to guarde himſelfe there-with, ſo that theyr former manner of fight was now quite changed: for the Monſter layde luſtilie about him with the ſworde, which <hi>Trineus</hi> ſtill well awarded with the Forke, the length whereof did greatly auaile him, and hee gaue the Monſter there-with ſuch a ſtabbe in the bellie, that hardly could hee make any more reſiſtance.</p>
               <p>The Witch (ſtanding all this while at a window, to ſée what ſucceſſe this combate would ſort to) had in ſuch ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ornaments attired herſelfe, that ſhée ſéemed a verie goodly and beautifull creature: aloude ſhee cried out vnto the Knight, not to kill the Monſter in any caſe, promiſing
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:14347:159"/>
in recompence of ſparing his life, that ſhe would deliuer to him all the men and women which ſhee there detained in the enchauntment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Trineus</hi> beeing moued both with her beautie and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſpéeches, ſtoode ſtill to condiſcend to her requeſt: but one of the young women thus cryed to him. Faire Knight, giue no credite to the fained gloſings of this damned Hagg, for ſhée will not performe whatſoeuer ſhe promiſes, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delude you with friuolous deuiſes, to hinder yée from fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing ſo important an aduenture.</p>
               <p>Theſe words made <hi>Trineus</hi> ſtep againe to the Monſter, hoping by his foyle to conclude the enchauntment, but hee caught the Knight ſo ſtrongly within his armes, that hee had much adoe to fetch his breath: and in this manner hee ranne with him toward the water, as purpoſing there to throw him in, to the end he might be bereft of all vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. But the Knight ſtrugling mainely with him, gotte at laſt out his dagger, where-with he gaue him ſo many ſtabs, that he was glad to let him goe, &amp; then the Monſter made offer of caſting himſelfe into the Lake, but <hi>Trineus</hi> miſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting no good meaning therein toward himſelfe, caught him faſt by one legge, and held him ſo violently, that downe fel the beaſt and he together: then did the Monſter catch him faſt by the Helmet, and had ſo bruſed him with the fall, as alſo with his heauie burden lying vpon him, that hee was well néere paſt all remembrance of himſelfe, and with his ſharpe tuſhes he ſo beate him about the Helmet, that hee ſhiuerd it in very many places.</p>
               <p>At laſt, recouering his ſences againe, by méere extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of anguiſh hée felt in his head, hée gotte the Monſter ſo ſtiffely by the throate, that hée compeld him to tumble be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide him, and then with his dagger hee quickly diſpatcht him: When ſuddenly the earth beganne to tremble verie ſtrangely, and opening with a wide gaping rift, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly ſwallowed the Monſter and his Forke, nor could the leaſt droppe of blood be diſcerned, but it was likewiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured in this opening of the ground.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14347:160"/>
                  <hi>Trineus</hi> béeing ſore laboured and ſpent with trauaile, ſought for ſome conuenient place where he might ſit to reſt himſelfe, and eſpying a lowe ſeate a pretty way from the Lake, went preſently thether: where hee beheld the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Armes of ſuch, as had béene before deſpoiled thereof, and afterward were throwne into the flood. There did he put off his owne Helmet, becauſe it was bruſed and battered with many ſore blowes, and taking vp an other, made proofe thereof, by diuers ſtrokes giuen with his dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers pommell, and not knowing where to prouide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe better of a ſword, tooke vp a goodly one, which indéede belonged before to one of his owne Knights.</p>
               <p>No ſooner was hée in this manner prepared, but hée ſawe comming againſt him, a Beaſt of an vnaccuſtomed ſtrangeneſſe, béeing in ſtature as great as a Camell, with two hornes, which hée turned euery way at his owne plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: his feete and clawes were like to a Lyons, his tayle aboue foure times the length of ones arme, and faſhioned round like vnto a roape, where-with it ſéemed hee made good vſe of ſeruice, by binding ſuch Knights as ſhould enter combate with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Trineus</hi> ſtoode awhile conſidering with himſelfe, more doubtfull of the beaſts tayle then of his hornes, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede both gaue matter enough of admiration: but becauſe that was no place for fruitleſſe expence of time, hee prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelfe in action for ſafeguarde of his life, practiſing which way victory was likelieſt to be obtained.</p>
               <p>The beaſt made at him furiouſly with his hornes, and perceiuing hee could not catch him within compaſſe of his tayle, becauſe by his heedfull eye-ſight and nimble leaping off he very well preuented it, hee turned aſide at him with his left horne, and ſmote him ſo forcibly there-with on one ſide of his head, that he tumbled quite ouer and ouer on the ground: and ſurely if the Beaſt had had ſo much power as then to haue ſtayed himſelfe, the fight had there béen ended on <hi>Trineus</hi> behalfe, but holding on his courſe, as vnable to ſtay ſo ſuddainly, returning backe againe, hee founde the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:14347:160"/>
Knight gotten vp on his féete, but yet ſo greatly aſtonied with the ſtroake and fall, as if the Beaſts capacitie coulde haue reached to the vnderſtanding thereof, the caſe had ſtoode very hard with the Knight.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Trineus,</hi> perceiuing (by this former triall) the Beaſtes aſſaults to be very dangerous, with moſt circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and watchfull care ſtood well vpon his guarde, that by no meanes hee ſhould come to cloſe with him: and as the Beaſt had knit round his taile, thinking to catch him faſt there-with about the necke, the Knight intercepted it with a reuerſſe blowe, that cutte it off aboue an armes length. Nowe was <hi>Trineus</hi> in greater perrill then before, for the Beaſt béeing mightily enraged through the anguiſh of this wounde, beganne to flie aloft aboue the Knights height, as ſéeking that way to ſeaze vppon, and gette him faſt bounde within his taile, ſo that nowe if he had not a very prouident fore-ſight and héedfull reſpect to him, there was no remedie but he muſt be ſlaine.</p>
               <p>Aloft therefore aboue his head did <hi>Trineus</hi> wheele his ſworde, with many ſharpe thruſts amongſt his flouriſhes, which wounded the Beaſt often as hee ſoared aboue him: yet ſtill he perſeuerd on craftie aduantages, and chaunced to fling his tayle ſo vnluckilie, that hee bound the Knights legges ſo faſt there-with as he could not ſtirre, and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp ſo aloft with him, gaue his head diuers dangerous blowes againſt the ground: but the extreame payne hee felt by loſſe of part of his tayle, made him not able to holde him long in that ſort, and <hi>Trineus</hi> féeling himſelfe at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, quickly recouered his footing, following the Beaſt at ſo apt an opportunitie, that hee quite cut off one of his hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der legges, and (hoping of further ſucceſſe) ſtill followed vppon him, but the Beaſt hurt him in the breaſt with his horne, and vnder the ribbes with one of his pawes, where he had rent his Cuiraſſe open, but the wounds were not of any great validitie.</p>
               <p>The Knight giuing the beaſt as little reſpite as might be, gaue him a great hurt in the head, which hee awarded

                  <hi>Trineus</hi> being ſore wounded and weary, when he ſaw ſo many returne like enemies, (for they were aboue ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand in number,) he reckoned him ſelfe as a dead man: but not to looſe his life fondly and raſhly, he ſtood prepared what euer might happen, a teſtimonie of his vnconquerable ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. The armed Knights, prouoked by the enchauntment, went on againſt him, but he mooued not from his place, and when they came néere him, they ſtood all ſtill, as if they had not the power to hurt him.</p>
               <p>The Witch, thinking verily to murder him among ſuch a multitude, when ſhee ſawe not one of them ſtirre to ſtrike him, ſhee ranne to her ſpelles, and finding that he had a Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, which defended him from her charmes, contriued another ſtratagem to endaunger him withall, and made a large bridge appeare ouer the water, whereon the wilde beaſtes on the further ſide of the lake, might haue liberty of paſſage whether they would.

The beaſts beeing driuen away, nothing nowe remained,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:14347:162"/>
but onely his entraunce into the Tower, which was all of fine Marble, and ſo ſmooth, as no holde might any way be faſtened on it.</p>
               <p>The men, who by the Witches commiſſion came out of the lake, and receaued their Armes for her defence: by this foyle of the beaſts, were fréed from enchauntment, and nowe deſired to be reuenged on her, who had helde them ſo long in ſuch a wretched ſtate of life: and electing <hi>Trineus</hi> as their Generall, went on toward the Tower, but <hi>Dir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cea,</hi> perceauing her imminent caſe of perrill, threwe a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilliſh ſpell abroade, that euery one of them were ſtrucken blinde, ſight remayning onely but to <hi>Trineus,</hi> by the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wells vertue which ſafely defended him.

               <p>Nowe was this the laſt and moſt dangerous acte of the enchauntment, becauſe (ſoone after) iſſued foorth of the rockie Tower, a Knight hauing the ſtature of a Giant, his Armour beeing blacke, his Shielde without any impreſe, and mounted on a darke bay Courſer, with a Dwarffe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing him, and armed in all reſpectes like him. This Knight, without vſing any other courteſie to <hi>Trineus</hi> (who was one foote) ranne proudly at him with his Launce, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering many thruſtes and blowes at him, but none came néere him: for our gallant Champion, deſirous to conquer nowe or neuer, auoyded all his attempts with nimble dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teritie, deliuering diuers fierce ſtrokes at the Horſes legs, to the ende he might fall downe with his Maiſter, but eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie blowe ſeemed as ſmitten vpon braſſe, rebounding backe without any other ſucceſſe, which made him growe doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of the aduentures concluſion, becauſe he felt him ſelfe excéedingly wearied, and the wounds in his breaſt did very much annoy him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14347:163"/>As thus he ſtood wayting ſome better opportunity, for his readieſt departure thence with honour, the Horſe paſſing ſomewhat néere him, he caught faſt hold on his bridle, and turning him often about, gaue ſo many ſtabbs at the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Knight, that hee made him fall beſide his backe to the ground, caſting him ſelfe vp preſently into the ſaddle, but had no Launce to helpe him withall.</p>
               <p>The Dwarffe, who all this while ſtoode beholding this battaile, when hee ſawe the Giant on the ground, and the Knight ſeated in the ſaddle: hee leapt vp on the crouper of the Horſe, &amp; troubled <hi>Trineus</hi> about his neck very ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and hee (to rid him ſelfe of this apiſh burden) made di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers proffers with his hands to take holde of him, but the Dwarffe was ſo ſkittiſh euery where about him, that hee did nothing but hold him daliance, till the Giant had got vp on foote againe, and came a freſh to charge him with his Launce, which euermore as hee made a thruſt forwarde, withall with a quicke hand, he ſtill drewe it back againe, whereat <hi>Trineus</hi> began not a little to meruaile, procéeding on to this coniecture, that therein the force of the incantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conſiſted, and making no reſpect of any trauaile what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, hee oppoſed him ſelfe to the Dwarffes ſhiftes and ſleights, the rather becauſe hee had no weapon to defende him, and being watchfull withall of the Giants Launce, as he thruſt it at him and puld it back againe, he made vpon him with the Horſe, and by good hap caught hold of it with his right hand, when preſently the Dwarffe ſkipt iuſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, onely to impeach his hold of the Launce, and with the other hand hee faſtened on him alſo: but the Giants ſtrength was ſo powerfull in drawing back the Launce, as he felt great paine in the with-holding it: neuertheleſſe, he purpoſed rather to forgoe his life, then leaue his hold of the Launce, and (catching the Dwarffe at an aduantage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene his arme and his body) hee faſtned his left hand on the Launce likewiſe, and ſo haling it to him with both his handes, ſtill looke howe much the Knight recouered of the Launce, ſo much did the Giant looſe of his magicall ſtrength
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:14347:163"/>
giuen him by the Witch, ſo that forgoing it all at laſt, he fell downe backward along on the ground, &amp; the Dwarffe then getting looſe from <hi>Trineus,</hi> ranne a pace toward the Tower, which began to ſmoulder and ſmoke in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as if it burned, and getting entrance, the Dwarffe was neuer after ſéene.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Trineus</hi> leauing the Giant there lying, went néerer to the Tower, where beholding the windowes and gate to be open, he imagined that the Enchauntreſſe was fled: the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe all the people which before were ſmitten blind, had now recouered their ſight againe, and came run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning altogether to the Tower, but being vnable to enter, by reaſon of the ſmoke, ſome of them returned back where the Giant lay, and ſtabbing at him with their Launces, leaſt hee ſhould ariſe againe, found nothing there but the empty Armour. Within an houre after, the Tower fell, and the ſmoke ceaſed, to the no little ioy of <hi>Trineus,</hi> when he perceaued the aduenture to be finiſhed, ſo (with-draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him ſelfe to bind vp his wounds) <hi>Dircea</hi> the Witch, fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aloft in the ayre ouer his head, ſtayed her haſt a while, and thus ſpake to him. I am not willing <hi>Trineus,</hi> to tarry any longer in this Iland, which thou haſt gotten badly from me: but hold it for moſt certaine, that to whatſoeuer place thou ſhalt betake thy ſelfe, I will ſtill be by thée to hinder thy deſſeignes: but eſpecially I will ſo plague the courſe of thy loue, as thou ſhalt neuer quietly enioy it: and hauing thus ſaid, away ſhe fled.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Trineus</hi> made no account of all theſe threatnings, but calling ſome of them, who had beene held by the Witch in ſuch a wretched kinde of life, enquired further of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, but could learne no otherwiſe of them then he had done before. So remaining a while there vnder cure, thoſe Knights and their aſſociates which had ſo long béen there, were very deſirous of viſiting their own natiue Countries: and ſtanding on the Sea ſhoare, they diſcerned farre off di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers ſpread ſailes, which (on their call) comming thether to them, thanking <hi>Trineus</hi> and taking leaue of him, many

               <p>All the Chriſtian Armie, ſéeing <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> in ſuch danger, gaue a meruailous loude out-cry, which mooued <hi>Palmerin</hi> foorth-with to catch at another Ladder, and hee aſcended the wall with ſuch ſpéedineſſe, that hee ſéemed to ſome as if he had flowne vp, and finding he was reſiſted by <hi>Broco,</hi> thought yet to make his part good enough, but then he was in perrill to be caſt downe with diuers Launces, which out at the loope-holes were bent againſt him: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe,

               <p>Now indéed, becauſe the wall was well furniſhed with men, which came ſtill in freſh ſupplies, to preuent our Souldiours from their entraunce: the multitude of Laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces darted at them, and ſhowers of ſtones falling euerie way on them, had queſtionleſſe there concluded their liues, but that it fell out ſo well and luckilie, that <hi>Blandidon</hi> had begunne a freſh charge in his quarter, whereto <hi>Francian</hi> and <hi>Oltrando</hi> (neighbouring with their forces) raiſed an vnexpected aſſault on thoſe parts of the Cittie.

               <p>
                  <hi>Floraman,</hi> not diſliking this aduiſe, cauſed certaine Rammes and other engines to be brought, which béeing imployed againſt the wall, with ſuch ſufficient ſtrength as was requiſite, in a little while they made ſo large a breach, that the Pagans in the Citty (béeing no way able to hinder them) the Chriſtians forcibly entred like to a maine cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lanfranco</hi> and <hi>Broco,</hi> ſéeing they were thus entred the Citty, leauing the former taſke they had in hand, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently forſooke the Wall, beginning to make ſpoyle among our people: but <hi>Floraman</hi> and <hi>Trineus</hi> ſo valiantly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode them, that <hi>Palmerin, Dramuſiande,</hi> and <hi>Gracian,</hi> had leiſure to deſcend, and came to aſſiſt them with their friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuccour.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Dirdan</hi> had gotten intelligence héereof, leauing <hi>Leouino</hi> and <hi>Treſino</hi> to defend theyr quarter, hee haſtened to helpe where was more neede, and ſeeking for <hi>Palmerin</hi> to die by his hand, he ranne like a furious mad man vp and and downe, till at length méeting with him, he thus ſpake.

               <p>When the Warriours for the Cittie ſawe the death of their Lord, and that <hi>Blandidon</hi> had gotten entraunce like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in the quarter which he held, they would very gladly haue deſired mercie: But <hi>Lanfranco, Broco,</hi> and <hi>Leouino,</hi> cruelly menacing ſuch as offered to yéeld themſelues, made forward among the thickeſt, béeing lothe to fall into the the Chriſtians power, as knowing that they iuſtly merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the names of Traytours, becauſe theyr Father <hi>Palur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> held his Kingdome by fauour of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Empire, all which they now made no account of, but hartened on the Souldiours that were vnder theyr charge, and continued the fight with vndaunted reſolution.</p>

This maime was ſo full of anguiſh to the Giant, that making now no more reckoning of his life, with his other hand hee got <hi>Palmerin</hi> faſt by the Helmet, ſhaking him forward and backward in ſuch rude manner, as by no meanes hee could gette looſe from him, but there had had his breath ſhaken out of his body: for the Giant (féeling ſharpe death approching) ſo boyſtrouſly flung and threw him about, as if <hi>Francian</hi> by good hap had not béene neere, who gaue him a ſpéeding ſtab in the flancke, (which wounde comming altogether vnloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for) made him leaue <hi>Palmerin,</hi> and vſe what extremitie he could to <hi>Francian,</hi> when grapling faſt with him, his weakeneſſe (with expence of blood) did quite ouer-beare him, ſo that downe fell <hi>Francian</hi> and the Giant vpon him, where hée had vndoubtedly died vnder his heauie weight, but that certaine Knights being by, and eſpying the danger wherein he was, did quickly recouer him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Broco,</hi> combatting this while with <hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> yet ſéeing when his Brother fell downe, ſpake as followeth: Braue Knight, if thou be as curteous as valourous, permit me to goe and comfort my Brother, whom thou ſeeſt yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der falne to the grounde, and wounded (to death I thinke) by one of thy company.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> béeing euer of a gentle nature, ſtepping backe from him, ſayd: Goe, and (if thou canſt ſaue thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers life) doe, thou ſhalt not ſay, but thy foe can affoorde thée that honeſt curteſie.</p>
               <p>This kinde aunſwere, did <hi>Broco</hi> as kindly commend in his hart, and kneeling downe by his Brother, founde hée was dead: whereupon, knowing that was no place for fruitleſſe lamentation, hee returned backe againe to <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſiande,</hi> &amp; thus ſpake to him.

               <p>At theſe ſpéeches <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> threw by his ſword, and catching him faſt in his armes, accepted him as his louing Brother, agreeing thence-forward to holde conſtant amitie together.</p>
               <p>By this time was <hi>Palmerin</hi> face to face with <hi>Gargante,</hi> betwéene whom grewe ſuch a fierce battaile as the like was neuer ſéene, and <hi>Leouino,</hi> (after he forſooke the wall towards <hi>Blandidons</hi> quarter) came and met with <hi>Dramu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiande,</hi> againſt whom a while hée bare himſelfe valiantlie, but in the end, hee was ſo ouer-laboured with the Giants ſturdie blowes, and ſo faint with long continuaunce of the fight, beeing alſo wounded vnder the ſhort ribbes, that hee fell to the earth, when <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> (quickly vnlacing his Helmet) had ſmitten off his head, but that hee cryed out: Sir Knight, for Gods ſake ſpare my life, (and kill me not) doe with mee otherwiſe whatſoeuer ſéemeth good in your owne liking.</p>
               <p>The Giant tooke from him his ſword and Shielde, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining that hée ſhould be carried thence to <hi>Broco,</hi> and then afterward they went together to the place, where <hi>Oliuan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> and <hi>Pompides</hi> were detained as priſoners, where the doore of the Chamber béeing opened vnto them, they were both foorth-with armed as before.

But <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gante,</hi> being altogether gouerned by his great valour, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſight or iudgement in euident perrill, continued his fierce rage of laying about him, till in deede he was ſo farre ouer-gone with trauaile, that whatſoeuer blowes he ſmote, could doo no more domage.</p>

                  <hi>Oliuanto</hi> (all this while) making vſe of the others fury, and knowing aſſuredly what it would ſort to at laſt, ſpared his owne labour till occaſion better ſerued: and then his blowes (like thunder) fell on his enemie, that making him to réele and ſtagger round about the place, at laſt hee fell backward, when <hi>Oliuanto,</hi> taking off his helmet, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding whether he would yeelde or no, perceauing no aunſwere was returned, preſently he parted his head from his body.

               <p>Encountring at laſt vpon a croſſe way, the young Knight cried to <hi>Tarnaes,</hi> that he ſhould ſtay, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> taking his Launce, which he had reared vp againſt a tree, he came toward him vſing theſe ſpéeches.

                  <hi>Tarnaes</hi> would haue defended him ſelfe, by allegation of not knowing him, and that her brother had highly wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him, in aſſayling him without any cauſe of offence: but the Damoſell, whoſe tongue ranne a little at too much ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, multiplied her iniurious ſpéeches in ſuch ſort, and went ſo farre in womanniſh weakenes, that he (not to be ſeene in ſo ſhameleſſe a contention,) turning his Horſe, left her there rayling at her owne pleaſure. The Damoſell, being named <hi>Pandina,</hi> cauſing her brother to be caried to curing, mounted on her Palfray and purſued <hi>Tarnaes,</hi> arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing before him at the Ile of <hi>Carderia,</hi> whereas ſhe fell in arguing with <hi>Leonato,</hi> and boldly deſired him to reuenge her on a Knight, that bare for his deuiſe a mans head in his Sheeld, declaring withall, that he wanted an eye, and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped ſuch a ſound tale to him, as <hi>Leonato</hi> verily beleeued it for an vndoubted truth, and there-vpon grew ſo encenſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Tarnaes,</hi> as nothing but death was his determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and (within leſſe then an houre after the Damoſels de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture) <hi>Tarnaes</hi> came trotting his Courſer thether.</p>

                  <hi>Leonato</hi> ſeeing him make toward the Iland, being ready armed for all commers whatſoeuer, rode forth to meet him, ſaying.

I come to vndergoe the aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this Iland, and to conquer thée, except thou knoweſt how better to forbid me.</p>
               <p>I can and will forbid thée, aunſwered <hi>Leonato,</hi> and ſo (without any more words) they fell to the encounter, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding little difference in the vertue of eithers ſtrength, ſaue onely <hi>Tarnaes</hi> appeared to haue the moſt diſaduantage, by a ſlight hurt receaued on the ſhoulder, which onely happened by power of the enchauntment: which he neuer minding, came to try his enemie at the ſwords point, ſaluting him ſo ſoundly on the helmet, that it ſeemed as if he had cleft it in twaine. Nowe albeit his ſtrokes were giuen with great manhood, and able enough to ſtagger a ſetled iudgement:
<pb facs="tcp:14347:172"/>
yet the falſe appearance of beléeuing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to be woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, grew to ſuch a perturbation of minde betwéene them, that eyther fell into a mighty ſuſpition, which way the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie was likelieſt to encline.</p>
               <p>Heere-vpon, <hi>Leonato</hi> gaue back ſtill toward the Iland, and <hi>Tarnaes</hi> with vndaunted courage followed, ſo that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was halfe aware of it, he found him ſelfe to be vpon the Bridge, and there he was ſurprized with a ſuddaine vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent winde, which caried him to the abiding of <hi>Don Roſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell</hi> and <hi>Almaroll,</hi> where changing his former thoughts to a contrary alteration, with the reſt, hee gaue him ſelfe to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace and paſtimes.

               <p>Many Knights came thether from diuers Prouinces, ſuſtayning the like fortune at <hi>Leonatoes</hi> hands, and caried by him into the Iland. So farre ſpread the fame of this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture, that from all Countries came gallants to combate <hi>Leonato,</hi> who maintayned his vndertaken charge with ſuch hardy valour, as whoſoeuer hazarded his fortune, hee remained ſtill the conquerour.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Lorendos, Florian,</hi> and <hi>Berolde,</hi> when they had loſt the ſight of the Ladies, followed their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite two dayes in vaine: becauſe <hi>Druſa Velonna,</hi> (after ſhee had let the Knights once haue but a ſight of them,) engirt them with ſuch a coale-blacke cloude, as it was impoſſible any more to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde them, vntill the Witches pleaſure were woone thereto. So ſeating them ſelues all thrée by a Fountaines ſide, vpon an aduiſed conſultation, they concluded each man ſhould trauaile alone, not doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting but it might fall to one of their haps, to finde the place where the Ladies were enchaunted: ſo, hauing well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed themſelues, with ſuch prouiſion as their Squires could get, friendly they tooke farewell one of another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Berolde</hi> not knowing in what Countrey he was, tooke (by chaunce) the way toward <hi>Macedon,</hi> and in very fewe dayes (without any queſtioning after the ſoile, becauſe hee rode on ſad and melancholly) he arriued at the Ile of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deria:</hi> where ſuddainly beholding a goodly Pallace, and an armed Knight prepared to the Iouſt, hee thought hee had found the enchauntment of <hi>Velonna,</hi> ſo riding to the man, to be reſolued in his hope, he thus ſpake. Sir Knight, let it ſéeme no matter offenſiue to you, to let me vnderſtand the quality of this place, and whether any paſſage muſt be bought by the perrill of your power, or no.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:14347:173"/>The qualitie of the place (aunſwered <hi>Leonato</hi>) you may not know, but concerning the danger of your paſſage, that conſiſts in your ſelfe: either by turning backe againe, or leauing (as vanquiſhed) your Shield and name. Neither of theſe conditions (ſaid <hi>Berolde</hi>) can I accept of, except my hands were bound behind mee, and with theſe wordes, hee turnd his horſe for the tryall.</p>
               <p>The encounter was ſharpe and furious, <hi>Leonato</hi> loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his ſtirrops, but <hi>Berolde</hi> was diſmounted, imagining that hée receiued a hurt in his ſide, and béeing on foote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, prepared to enter combate with the ſword, but a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent winde carried him into the Pallace, and there ſtaied he priſoner in <hi>Carderia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Florian</hi> tooke toward the Mountaine of Stéele, onelie through the bruited fame of that enchaunted place, where looke howe many hapned thether, were tranſ-formed into Stéele, yet kéeping the ſhape and forme of men, and al ſuch Knights as coaſted this Country, remained there in like ſort enchaunted. The difficultie of this hazardous aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo laboured the forward deſires of <hi>Florian,</hi> that hoping to finde his daughter there, hee went to the Sea-ſide, and finding conuenient paſſage, hee ſhould be brought within a miles diſtance of the Mountaine, but further they durſt not bring him, as dreading (if they went neerer) to be changed into ſtéelie ſhapes.</p>
               <p>Two dayes they ſayled, beholding the Mountaine to glitter where the Sun-beames touched, and the next day in the morning, they found themſelues ſo néere, that the Marriners cryed out with feare, doubting they ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer more part thence againe, and therefore by no meanes would put to ſhoare: but <hi>Florian,</hi> not willing to be thwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his deſſeignes, ſéeing they would beare him backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine whether hee would or no, drewe foorth his Sworde, threatning the Marriners with immediate death, except they landed him where he appointed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The Marriners little dreading with who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they contended, prepared to ſtand vpon their owne defence, but a Turke of <hi>Tubante</hi> béeing in
<pb facs="tcp:14347:174"/>
company, that very well knew <hi>Florian,</hi> and (for his owne ſafetie) had helde his peace: aduertiſed the Marriners, that this was one of the high eſtéemed Knights of the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> Court, and there was no wiſedome in medling with him, except they were all a-wearie of their liues.</p>
               <p>This counſell preuailed in ſuch white-liuerd fellowes, ſo that (in great terrour) they put to the ſhoare, where hée with his horſe and Squire went quickly a-land, preparing toward the foote of the Mountaine: but the Ship foorthwith departed, and the Turke wrought ſo aduiſedly, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſtoode ſtill vpon the Anchor, to ſée what would become of <hi>Florian,</hi> that he might giue intelligence thereof to <hi>Targiana</hi> his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, who he knew had accepted him for her huſband. <hi>Flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> who tooke no héede of ſuch idle matters, leauing his Squire ſome-what ſhort of the Mountaine, where was no danger of alteration, went on about his buſines, and as hee ſet foote vpon the Mount, all thoſe Knights, (which had been there before metamorphoſed to ſtéelie ſhapes) began to ſtir theyr armes, as if they purpoſed to oppoſe themſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him: but when he perceiued they mooued not out of theyr places, hee ſmilde at ſo vaine and cauſeleſſe a feare, hoping all the reſt would prooue no otherwiſe, wherein hee ſoone founde himſelfe deceiued, for hee had not gone vp the quantitie of halfe a mile, but he came to a quadrant plaine, of thirty paces euery way, where before his face he beheld a doore of Steele, which ſeemed to belong vnto a Caue, and ouer it was a Tombe of the ſelfe-ſame mettall.</p>
               <p>Standing ſtill to regard a matter of ſuch admiration, as that hollowe vaſt place appeared to be, the couerture of the Tombe was ſuddainly lifted vp, and throwne to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground, when preſently aroſe vppon her feete, a Lady with diſheue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led hayre and moodie lookes, hauing a Sworde thruſt tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row her necke, tearing a wounde that ſeemed freſhlie to bléede, and ſhée leaping foorth vppon the ground before <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</hi> began to vtter theſe ſpeeches.</p>
               <p>Foole-hardie Knight, right ill for thée is this thy b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:14347:174"/>
Know that thou art to combate with mée, and vntill I am vanquiſhed, make thou full account to enioy no reſt. So concluding her ſpéeches, ſhee drew another ſword from her ſide, and beganne there-with luſtily to lay at <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</hi> who (bluſhing as aſhamed of ſo infamous a conflict) awarded her ſtrokes with his Shielde, not drawing foorth his ſword to ſtrike againe: but one blowe béeing giuen by her at his knée, hee felt it to cut quite through his Armour, whereon hée imagining her to be no Woman, but rather ſome infernall Hagge or Furie, drewe likewiſe his wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, and gaue the Lady ſuch a ſtroke vppon the ſhoulder, as might eaſily haue entred thoſe men of Stéele, yet made no ſigne at all of hurting her, whereat the Knight meruailed not a little, feeling his body in many places payned, where the Ladies blowes had lighted on him, and when theyr ſwordes chaunced to méete together, he feared leaſt his own would fall out of his hand.</p>
               <p>Greatly did it abaſh and diſgrace <hi>Florian</hi> (in his owne thoughts) to holde this kinde of difference with a Lady ſo long, yet ſince his wonderment in bootleſſe reſiſtance, and alſo her weighty ſtrokes in ſufferance, perforce conſtrained him ſo to doo: hee ſhaped an aduantageable blowe at the wound in her necke, which the Lady with agile and right ſpéedie defence auoyded, whereupon, the Knight in preſent iudgement gathered, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in her necke lay the hidden meanes of her conuincing, which made him ayme euery ſtroake di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly at that part, forcing thereby the Lady to cunning retires, which <hi>Florian</hi> ouer-ſlipped not, but with heedfull care and dilligence followed, vntill hee had driuen her to the doore before remembred, which (ſuddenly of it ſelfe) o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, and the Lady catching <hi>Florian</hi> faſt about the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, carried him with her into the Caue, and preſently the doore cloſed againe.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Florian</hi> ſaw himſelfe in ſuch a helliſh darkneſſe, and on euery ſide ſmitten all the way he went, he began to flouriſh his ſword about him, yet féeling nere a ſtroke of his to light on any thing: but ſtill the more hee went forward,
<pb facs="tcp:14347:175"/>
the more it ſéemed to him he deſcended, and ſtill the Ladie layd on him, whom in this darknes he could by no meanes diſcerne, yet at laſt, his fayre ſtarres ſo fauouringly ſmilde on him, that his weapon happened into the wound in her necke, and hearing her fall, at the inſtant he heard theſe ſpeeches deliuered: <hi>Fortune hath fauoured thee, but Arte ſhall ouer-come thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Florian,</hi> whoſe high ſpirit aymed onely at victorie, ſpurnd at theſe threatnings, as matter of no moment, but paſſing on ſtill, and ſtill deſcending, he beganne to diſcerne a great light, which very much comforted him in this obſcuritie, hoping now to be deliuered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo long a ſtay vnder-ground: but his apprehenſion was erronious, for it was a Baſiliſke which thwarted his way, and came mainly againſt him beating his winges, flying round about him with ſuch cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, as <hi>Florian</hi> could faſten no blow to offend him, yet did the Baſiliſke ſwéepe at him in ſuch ſort, as hee was enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to fall downe back-ward, when houering ſtil euer him, and flapping him with his winges, hee tumbled him ſtill downe and downe, aboue fiftie ſteppes in eſtimation. All which not diminiſhing a iote of his valour, at laſt hee gotte footing, and awayted the Baſiliſke, that came with a freſh intent to ouerthrow him againe, but the Knight ſtanding aduiſedly on his guard, ſcaunced aſide, and (in his paſſage by) gaue him ſuch a ſtroke, as ſeuerd from his bodie one of his winges: which maime was ſo gréeuous to the Baſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſke that turning furiouſly vpon him againe, hee gotte faſt hold on him betwéene his feete, and terribly cut his Helmet with his ſharpe beake, though that was nothing (in reſpect) to the venim that came foorth of his eyes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Florian</hi> well perceiuing, that except hee beſtird himſelfe the ſpéedier, he muſt néedes end his life betwéene the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters féete, whéeled his ſword about with all the nimblenes he could vſe, &amp; chaunced to giue a blow at the bright ſtone, which the Baſiliſke bare on his head in ſtedde of a creaſt, which falling downe on one ſide of him, ſo did the Baſiliſke on the other, quite bereft of all ſence and power of further

offending. <hi>Florian</hi> caught vp the ſtone, and placing it in the fore-part of his Helmet, procéeded onward, beeing no more impeached by the dim darknes.</p>
               <p>The way euer-more deſcending by degrées, made him grow ſuſpicious, that he ſhould at length goe downe to hel, but ſuddenly hee eſpied a Chamber doore open, whereinto boldly entring, he ſaw that it was hung round with black, and in the midſt thereof a couerd Tombe, out of which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared the handle of a Sword: there ſtood like-wiſe beſide it a goodly bedde, with Curtaines drawne round about it of black Veluet, which he preſuming to open a little, beheld the Lady there lying, with whom he had fought before, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the ſword ſtill thruſt thorow her necke, which vrging him to excéeding compaſſion, made him deliuer foorth theſe ſpéeches.</p>
               <p>Alas ſwéete Lady, if there be any thing, that may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déeme you from this wretched condition, doe but declare it, and reſt vndoubtedly aſſured of it.

               <p>
                  <hi>Florian</hi> defying all daunger what-ſoeuer, oppoſing his life to the very vttermoſt perrils, for fréedome of any that ſuffered diſtreſſe, as hée ſtoode leaning himſelfe againſt the bedde, there entred with a dreadfull noyſe into the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, a Monſter hauing the face of a man, his armes and breaſt like to a Lyon, but his clawes much longer then that beaſtes, then (in all reſpects like to a Griffon) was his body couered ouer with great broade ſcailes, ſurpaſſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Stéele in hardneſſe, his legges were longer then anie

mans, but in like manner armed as his body, and a huge taile he had, which euer (as he mooued it) flung forth ſmoke: but farre worſe then all this, he ledde a dogge in a leaſhe, of ſtrange forme and ſtature, the moſt miſhapen and ilfauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redſt Curre that euer was ſeene.</p>
               <p>The Lady ſéeing the Monſter, beganne to tremble, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating the Knight to defend her from the dogge, as béeing the deadlieſt enemie ſhe had. <hi>Florian</hi> kéeping them both off at his ſwords poynt, went firſt to the dogge (béeing the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt) and ſmiting him on the heade at his owne pleaſure, made him giue backe, but did him no hurt, whereat he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to meruaile not a little. The Monſter leapt vpon <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</hi> and hitting him with one foote iuſt on the breaſt, made him ſtagger ſo ſtrangely backe to the Tombe, that the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerture thereof fell quite beſide it, where he might beholde the ſword fixed in a Knights breaſt, which had ſo continued the ſpace of thirtie yeeres, and he ſtill breathing forth moſt doleful lamentations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Florian</hi> bluſhing to be ſo weakely thruſt backe, deliuered many ſounde ſtrokes on the Monſters ſcailes, but coulde make no entrance whereby to wound him: and the dogge riſing vp vppon his hinder féete, caught holde with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt on the Knights Helmet, byting him by the ſhoulder, then ſnarling at his legges, and racing his Armour with his horrible pawes, that it pained him very much to endure it.</p>
               <p>Much trouble did he endure in this fierce fight, and ſaw no likelihood of any good ſucceſſe to enſue, for the fierce rage of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Monſter was ſuch, as no humane ſtrength could haue conquered him, if the meanes wherein the enchauntments force conſiſted, were not by good hap firſt found out. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hauing made proofe of many ſtroakes, but all to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, he now would doo nothing elſe, but onely giue thruſts and foynes at him, whereof both the dogge and Monſter ſéemed to be fearefull: which <hi>Florian</hi> well noating, gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that this might be the way to ouer-come them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore continuing his foynes and thruſts ſtill, hee found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe

not ſo ſharply aſſayled by them as before. The Lady ſeeing the Knight to take ſo good a courſe, ſayd: Holde on ſo ſtill, thou honourable ſpirit.</p>
               <p>The Monſter hearing theſe wordes, let looſe the dogge out of his leaſh, which preſently catching the Ladie by the foote, drew her beſide the bedde, and dragd her along with him foorth of the Chamber, the Monſter likewiſe ſtepping to the Tombe, tooke the Knight vp on his ſhoulder, and went away with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Florian</hi> ſéeing them both borne thus away, whom he had ſo reſolutely purpoſed to defend, prepared to follow them, and the bright ſtone ſtill guiding him the way, brought him where the dogge and Monſter were in a Meadow, which had but one onely entrance into it, and was ſo rounded with ſtéepe hills on euery ſide, as whoſoeuer was once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, could not get foorth againe but by the ſame entrance. <hi>Florian</hi> made little account of this paſſage, but entring the Meadow, went toward the dogge and the Monſter, who had put the Knight and Lady into a corner of the Fielde, where they ſtoode wayling for the grieuous hurts they had receiued.</p>
               <p>The fight began nowe againe more dreadfull then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Florian</hi> perſwading himſelfe, that his ſtrength was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled, and defending himſelfe couragiouſly both againſt the one and other, remembred his former aduantage of thruſting, whereby his enemies gaue backe to the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, but turnd againe vppon him more freſhly then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: therefore when he likewiſe wexed wearie, as he ſaw the dogge and Monſter leane againſt the rampirde hills, euen ſo did hee, and founde his courage much thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed.</p>
               <p>Thus came he to be acquainted with the meanes, how the Monſter and dogge renewed their violence, ſo the fight holding on ſtill in this manner, his Armour was ſo bruſed about him, what with the Monſters pawes and the dogges ſharpe téeth, that hee felt himſelfe much afflicted thereby. Wherefore, vpon a breathing aduantage againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hill, not

regarding the dogge, hee went againſt the Monſter, and it was his good hap to hurt him in the throate, and the ſworde paſſing quite thorow, made him fal along backward, when <hi>Florian</hi> made offer to ſmite off his head, but the Lady cried to him, not to doe ſo: and preſently the ſword fel out of her necke, where nowe no hurt or wound could be diſcerned, but ſhe appeared right iocond and ioyfull, hoping to ſée her Knight likewiſe deliuered.</p>
               <p>Vpon the Monſters fall, the dogge began to flie ſo furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly on the Knight, that hee thought the ſtrength (of both together) was now in the dogge, but ſeruing his neceſſitie with ſtoute thruſts and foynes, and reſting him ſtill as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion gaue libertie: at laſt, (reſolued to liue or die) after a conflict of ſome long continuance, the dogge riſing vp to catch him by the Helmet, and biting him in diuers places as before he had doone, the Knight eſpying apt aduantage, made a full ſtabbe at the dogs breaſt, which pierced quite thorow on the other ſide, whereon the ſword fell out of the Knights breaſt, and hée was then in as good eſtate as euer he was before.</p>
               <p>The Lady beholding <hi>Florian</hi> full of painfull appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, by the oppreſſing blowes and gripes of two ſuch ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, conducted him thence into a Chamber, where ſtoode thrée ſumptuous beddes, the Curtaines of Crimoſine Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet frindged with gold, and ſuch were the hangings about the Chamber, in ſigne of chéerefull ioy and gladnes. Into the richeſt bedde was <hi>Florian</hi> layde, and his wounds right carefully dreſt by the Lady, who was ſtrangely altered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her former condition, when at firſt ſhee fought againſt the Prince, for ſhe appeared now to be of incomparable beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and alſo of right royall behauiour.</p>
               <p>Soone after, were the dog and Monſter, brought like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe into the ſame chamber, where (before theyr eyes) they both ſuddenly changed, the Monſter to a man of forty yeres age, and the dogge to a youthfull gallant, about foure and twentie, the one wounded in the throate, the other in the breaſt, and both ſo féeble, that they began to lye downe.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE day enſuing, <hi>Florian</hi> felt his hurts leſſe painfull to him, and the Lady with the Knight, ſtanding by his bed, holding fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar diſcourſe with him: hee earneſtly entreated them, that they would tell him of whence they were, and the reaſon of the ſtrange eſtate wherein he found them. The Lady, béeing deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to doo him any honourable ſeruice, ſaide: Stay my Lord a little. And going to a corner of the Chamber, ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned there a little doore, out of which came a Serpent ſome fiue foote long, of a very freſh gréene colour, and when it drew nere the bedde it leapt vpon it, putting the head ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of néere to <hi>Florians</hi> face, thinking to terrifie &amp; affright him: but hée who was neuer capable of feare, mooued not at it, but taking it to be ſome houſe Serpent, began to ſtroke it with his hand, and looke where his hand had toucht, the Serpents ſkinne immediatly fell off, and humane fleſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to appeare, ſo that by paſſing all thorowe his hand, the Serpent altered to a very beautifull Lady, but younger then the other, yet very like in countenaunce to her.</p>
               <p>No ſooner was this ſtrange mutation made, but the firſt Lady thus beganne. Underſtand (thou perfect mirrour of
<pb facs="tcp:14347:179"/>
honour and Armes) that I and this my Siſter, are daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the King of <hi>Carpatia,</hi> which is the olde man that lieth there, and by our guilty deſtenie it was appointed, that we ſhould both become enamoured, my ſelfe, of this Knight na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Cauno,</hi> and my Siſter, of him lying by my father, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Spinalo:</hi> folly, loue, and ignorance ſo farre preuailing with vs, that to them wee were not ſparing of our honour and perſons.</p>
               <p>Two yéeres together our practiſe continued, but with ſuch ſecrecie, as no eye could blab our ſweete felicity, till Fortune, the common enemie to happy quiet, made <hi>Spinalo</hi> grow regardleſſe of my Siſter, and with ſuch fierie temper become affected to me, that he ſought all meanes poſſible to compaſſe his deſires. I, who had dedicated my whole loue to <hi>Cauno,</hi> and held it as woorſe then abhorred ſacriledge, that one man ſhould haue knowledge of two naturall Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters: with diſcontented lookes, and thoughts as ſpléenfull, thus aunſwered him. Thou ſhouldſt (<hi>Spinalo</hi>) remember, how furtherous I haue beene vnto thée, in the ſilent poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of my Siſters loue, of whom (beyonde opinion) thou didſt ſéeme enamoured: but now I ſee thée ſo farre different from thy ſelfe, that contrary to all law of honour and reſpect, thou laboureſt, to make me turne traytour, to mine owne déere-reckoned delight: diſtaſt not thy (reputed good iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) with ſuch inciuilitie, nor ſuffer thy earſt-moderate temper, to be ſwayed by ſo baſe and vnmanlike behauiour: but kéepe thy faith vnſtaind to my Siſter <hi>Silinga,</hi> whoſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme of thée, is beyond my weake ability to expreſſe: ſo ſhalt thou iuſtly performe the office of manhood, &amp; we (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out impeach) ſtill enioy the benefits, of that which Fortune priuately hath enriched vs withall.</p>
               <p>Theſe honeſt and effectuall perſwaſions, might haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued him from ſo vile a ſinne, if but with diſcretion hee had ballaunced his owne woorth or ours: but they rather ſpurd him on to a more violent proſecution, exceeding the limits of any reſpect at all, ſo that turning to me (with an ill-appearing countenance) he ſayde. Imagine not, that
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:14347:179"/>
thou canſt eſcape me ſo, or that my deſſeignes will brooke this anticipation: rather will I aduenture the King thy fathers indignation, by beeing the trumpet of our ſecret ſtolne pleaſures, to inflict the heauier puniſhment on thee and <hi>Cauno.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now thinke (gentle Knight) what extreames aſſayled me, eyther I muſt doo a déede of damnation, or looſe louer, life, and honour together: héere-vpon I flung from him, and went to acquaint <hi>Silingo</hi> with theſe vnwelcom newes, appoynting time, place, and apt conuenience, when her owne eares (twixt him and me) ſhould drinke this balefull potion. When ſhee (too euidently) perceaued, howe farre <hi>Spinalo</hi> was become eſtraunged from her, hauing hid her ſelfe in a litle thicket, while thus the traytor aſſaild my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>One concluſion was, to aduertiſe <hi>Cauno</hi> thereof, that hee might the better foreſtall his perill: but this courſe of ours prooued, as (for the moſt part) womens counſels doo, woorſe and woorſe, for <hi>Cauno,</hi> who in his Loues priuation could cary no patience, made his iuſtly-conceaued diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure knowne to <hi>Spinalo,</hi> charging him to deſiſt from ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable a purſuite. But he who aymed ſtill at his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe with me, made no outward note of any ſuch prohibitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but goes and works with my Siſter <hi>Silinga,</hi> that ſhe ſhould labour me on his behalfe, vowing neuer to forget ſo great a kindneſſe: proteſting withall, it was but a capricious humour that thus ouer-ruled him, which if (but for once onely) hee might enioy, he would neuer mooue it after any more: where contrariwiſe, if ſhee could not winne me to affoorde him this grace, he would publiſh our ſtolne ſports to the King our father.</p>
               <p>The miſerable young Mayden, beſet on each ſide with ſuch weighty oppreſſion, promiſed to vndergoe ſo vnkinde an office, and awayting fit opportunity, prooued ſo preuay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling an Oratour, alleadging the vnauoydable perill, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb facs="tcp:14347:180"/>
we both ſtoode, that (as heauen knowes) with mighty vnwillingnes, I yéelded to her importunate perſwaſions. Behold into what ſtate looſe loue now brought me, my Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter gaue intelligence to <hi>Spinalo,</hi> that (at her entreates) I had condiſcended, and he (not a little proud thereof) thought euery minute a moneth till the time, which was concluded to be the morning following, when <hi>Cauno</hi> had appointed to ride on hunting. The houre being come, a moſt vnhappy houre for vs, ſhe brought <hi>Spinalo</hi> by an vnuſuall paſſage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a priuate way thorowe my Garden, and then <hi>Silinga</hi> (whoſe loue I know not how iuſtly to tearme, that (for his ſake) would ſo highly thus offend her ſelfe) hauing likewiſe accompanied me to the place: without vſing any wordes, with-drewe into her owne adioyning lodging, to bemoane her owne hard hap and my diſgrace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Spinalo</hi> hauing ſhut the doore, enioyed of me what he moſt deſired, and as I lay by him vpon the bed, he loath to leaue my company ſo ſoone: <hi>Cauno,</hi> who had purpoſely ſtaid from hunting, to awaite an occaſion ſo hatefull and accurſed, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a key, which euermore brought him to me, without the knowledge of any one, ſuddainly ruſht in vpon vs. How pleaſingly he tooke it, to finde me in that ſort, you can bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter imagine then I expreſſe, but I leaping from the bed, and he ayming all his mallice at me, ranne his Rapier through my neck, as your ſelfe lately beheld: and <hi>Spinalo,</hi> hauing likewiſe his weapon drawne, with enraged fury paſt it through his breaſt. My Siſter (whoſe ſorrowing thoughts fore-told her ſome fatall miſhap,) vpon my crie, came run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning into the chamber, and ſéeing the ſword ſo thorowe my necke, lamenting my hard lot, cried out aloude: Oh come and helpe vs miſerable wretches. This noiſe drew preſent concourſe to vs, firſt our wayting Gentlemen, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Guard of the Court, who foorth-with layd hands on the vnfortunate young Lords. And the King being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thether by ſo great a rumour, beholding an accident ſo vnexpected and vnpleaſing, would néedes be immediatly ſatiſfied therein: when, euery one being ſilent, I like one
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:14347:180"/>
deſperate, from the very originall declared the whole diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, whereat the King grewe ſo diſpleaſed, that (for a while) he ſéemd like one diſtraught of his ſences: but reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering better iudgement, breathing foorth a ſigh (as if his hart had broken,) he began in this maner. I will not with preſent death finiſh your offences, but inflict more paine for a further puniſhment, vntill ſuch a Knight of valour may be found, as dare to vndertake and accompliſh the ending of a fierce enchauntment, which ſhal be right ſuddainly and ſtrangely deuiſed: then turning him ſelfe to me, he ſayde. Thou that art falne in the very greateſt offence, which no ſhames bluſh can ſerue for, nor wil euer be forgotten: ſhalt haue that weapon ſo thruſt through thy necke, vntill my magick ſpells can be confounded. And thou <hi>Cauno,</hi> for of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending againſt thine owne honour, and concealing the vile purpoſe of <hi>Spinalo</hi> from me: ſhalt likewiſe haue that ſword abiding in thy breaſt, till like date of time may expire thy puniſhment, then calling <hi>Silinga,</hi> he ſayde. As for thee <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linga,</hi> reaping the iuſt harueſt of thy fonde ſowne folly, and wounding thy Siſters ſoule, to ſheeld thy ſelfe from thy idle fancies reiection: ſhalt become a Serpent, but ſo timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and hurtleſſe, as thou ſhalt ſhunne euery ones ſight, and deſire to approach néere none, yet ſhall the Knight be of vnequalled courage, that ſhall dare to touch thée with his hands, and thereby make thée receaue thy womans ſhape againe. For thée <hi>Spinalo</hi> (whom he could not beholde but very impatiently) that according to the brutiſh nature of a dogge, haſt made no diſtinguiſhing of humaine ſociety, but had the knowledge of two royall borne Siſters: I will haue thée tranſ-formed into the ſhape of a foule ill-proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned dogge, but to with-hold thée from ſo brutiſh ſtraying, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine thy liberty vnder check of a leaſh.</p>
               <p>Now come I to my ſelfe, to whom I will not be parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, in a caſe ſo mightily and mainely importing: but for my too-much neglecting the office of a father, not carying a ſtricter eye on my daughters looſenes, I will metamorphiſe my ſelfe to an vgly Monſter, for the ſafer defence of mine
<pb facs="tcp:14347:181"/>
owne enchauntment, and haue the charge of thée <hi>Spinalo</hi> in my leaſh.</p>
               <p>No ſooner had hee ſpoke theſe wordes, but making cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſignes and carracters about vs by his Arte, he cauſed this mountaine to appeare as couered with ſtéele, bringing hether the Baſiliſque which you haue ſlaine, and carying vs all in an obſcure cloude, brought vs to our ſeuerall pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, me into the Toombe before the gate: <hi>Cauno</hi> in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sepulcher in the chamber: <hi>Silinga</hi> in the little en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſure where ſhee came foorth: him ſelfe and <hi>Spinalo</hi> in thoſe other monſtrous ſhapes, to the place where they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted and ſet on you: and ſo for many yéeres haue wee continued, in which time ſundry woorthy Knights haue heere arriued, but beeing vnable to accompliſh the aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, haue béene changed into the forme of Stéelie men, but yet may recouer their former ſhapes againe, if you will binde my father to breake the force of the enchauntment. More then an houres ſpace, laſted the diſcourſing of this Hiſtorie to <hi>Florian,</hi> who when he ſawe the Lady had fullie concluded, roſe out of his bed, and taking the aged King by the beard, ſayde. How farre haſt thou ſwarued from a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers diſcretion, in puniſhing thine owne children to the hurt of others? thou mightſt haue chaſtiſed them in other maner, then by the ouerthrow of ſo many valiant Knights: but end all now, and let them be deliuered, or (deſpight thy deuils) I wil be ſoundly reuenged on thée.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solco,</hi> for ſo was the King named, ſéeing he grew ſo ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie with him, replied thus. Thinke not Sir Knight, that albeit (by mine Arte) I haue wrought ſo rare an enchaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I can therefore finiſh it at mine owne pleaſure. No Sir, your valour as much as my ſkill is required therein: for there are two fierce Lyons, which guard a little Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret, where they kéepe a Glaſſe continually ſmoaking, and thereby is the enchauntment maintayned: you muſt firſt conquer thoſe Lyons, and afterward doo ſomewhat elſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, which perhaps will be troubleſome enough vnto ye. A Gods name, ſaid <hi>Florian,</hi> let vs goe to it when thou wilt,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:14347:181"/>
and likewiſe (to him) commit our whole ſucceſſe: héere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon the Lady ſayd to <hi>Florian.</hi> Oh my Lord, giue no beleefe to this ſpéenfull olde man, who would haue vs (poore ſoules) continue ſtill in this his helliſh enchauntment: beſide, be be very carefull of your ſelfe, that you part not with the Baſiliſkes bright ſtone, for then we are all in danger of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. <hi>Florian</hi> tooke the leaſh, wherewith before <hi>Spinalo</hi> was led bound, &amp; faſtened the one end about the Kings neck, reſeruing the holde of the other part to him ſelfe, ſo did hee driue him along before him, commanding <hi>Spinalo</hi> likewiſe to follow iuſt behind him, who (alas) did ſo, but with no little gréefe, as knowing the fatall houre drew néere, when hee muſt (for euer) be tranſ-formed to a continuall Statue of Stéele. Hauing thus left the chamber, they went vp on the very higheſt of all the Mountaine, where (a far off) they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the little Turret, &amp; drawing néere vnto it, the other two began to ſtay, and <hi>Florian</hi> now went formoſt him ſelfe, but could not perceaue the Lyons to ſtir, vntill he had attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a little neerer them. Forth-with (together) they ſet vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently vpon him, one of them catching ſuch holde with his pawes on the Knights ſhéeld, that he rent it from about his neck, &amp; the other diſarmd one of his ſhoulders with his téeth: this fierce aſſault damped <hi>Florian</hi> a little, yet knowing that death could but be the woorſt, would ſet ſome deere price on it ere he parted with his life, returning ſuch a manly ſtroke to the firſt beaſt, that he gaue him a déepe wound on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and beſtowed the like hurt on the other in his flanke. Theſe two wounds did put him in preſent perill of his life, for (at one inſtant) both the Lyons ſo graſpt him about the legges, that down he fell whether he would or no, and then they ſo trode and ſcratcht him with their pawes, as the like was neuer ſéene before: but he beholding him ſelfe in ſuch danger, gaue ſuch a glenting blow with his ſword, that (fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the angrieſt beaſt) he cut off one of his féet, then holding vp his leg, as expreſſing his ſore paine, he gaue back &amp; ran into the Turret. The other Lyon caught the Knight faſt by one of his feete, &amp; dragd him ſo violently along vpon the ground,
<pb facs="tcp:14347:182"/>
as his ſword could doo him now but ſlender ſeruice, he found ſuch mighty inconuenience by the beaſts haling him.</p>
               <p>In this wonderfull perill, occaſion yet ſo fauoured <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</hi> that he caught holde about the ſtump of an olde Trée, whereto kéeping faſt with all his ſtrength, he ſuffered much diſtreſſe and anguiſh, by the Lyons ſtretching him forth to his vtmoſt length, as if hee had béene drawne out vpon a Rack: yet hoping this way to preſerue his life, ſo long hee held, till the Lyon growing weary of his ſtrong tugging, let goe his gripe, to get ſome better hold of him, when pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently the Knight leapt vp vpon his féete, and gaue ſo vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant a ſtroke at the beaſt, that it pared away a good part of his head, and queſtionleſſe had foorth-with ſlaine him, but that he ranne backe and got into the Turret. Beholding now none other to gaine-ſay his paſſage, he went on to the Turret, where he found the Lyons grinning and murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring at him, but ſéeing they were ſo hurt, as they could doo him litle harme, he began to enter: where-vpon, the beaſts (hauing loſt all power and vertue of the enchauntment, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen at the Knights ſetting foote on the Turrets foundation) ran away with all poſſible haſt vpon the mountaine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Florian</hi> hauing broken the bolts and locks of the Turret, opened the doore, and as hee put foorth his hand to take the Glaſſe which hee ſawe ſmouldring, there appeared a man with a huge Axe in his hand, who when <hi>Florian</hi> made offer to lay holde on the Glaſſe, ſmote ſuch blowes at him with the Axe, as not onely had béen ſufficient to cut off his arme, but likewiſe to cleaue him quite thorowe the midſt. Then heard he <hi>Solco</hi> (being behind him) ſhut the doore of the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret, locking him in, in ſuch a manner, as he was not to get out againe during the enchauntment.</p>
               <p>Now was the Knight very hardly beſted, when he knew neither how to come by the Glaſſe, nor how to recouer his Sheelde for his defence, for ſtill as hee profferd to take the Glaſſe, he with the axe boldly reſiſted him: and there might he haue ſo continued for many yeeres together, but that (by good hap) he remembred him ſelfe, that he which thus with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:14347:182"/>
him, might be a liuing man, and ſubiect to the danger of his weapon, defending the Glaſſe by treaſon and deceite. As this happy thought had thus poſſeſt him, taking his ſworde in the one hand, and making offer as before with the other to the Glaſſe, when the man made reſiſtance, hée gaue him a ſtabbe directly in the forehead, that the blood iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued forth and blinded his ſight: by meanes whereof he had libertie to ſeaze the Glaſſe, and giuing him other ſtabbes in the meane ſpace, made him fall downe along at his foote.</p>
               <p>Nowe were <hi>Solco</hi> and <hi>Spinalo</hi> come to the grated win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of the Turret, where with cunning ſpéeches they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured him, that by no meanes he ſhould breake the glaſſe, aſſuring him that if the glaſſe were broken, there was no way for him to get out of the Turret. <hi>Florian</hi> taking vp the huge great Axe, aunſwered: Then this ſhall ſerue mee as a key, and make an end of the enchauntment, which hee had no ſooner ſaid, but hee daſht the glaſſe in péeces againſt the yron grate, when ſuddenly was felt ſuch a terrible Earth-quake, as if all the Mountaine had ſplit in ſunder, which béeing ceaſſed, all the Knights (before tranſ-formed into Steelie-ſhapes) returned againe to their former condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but <hi>Spinalo,</hi> as one well woorthy of all ſeuere chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was preſently ſet on a piller of the Mountaine, and there conuerted into a Stéelie ſubſtaunce, with a ſpacious briefe fixed ouer his heade, declaring the whole hiſtorie at large of his lewdneſſe, as a méete example for all wicked men, forewarning them thereby to abſtaine frem ſuch baſe and luxurious deſires.</p>
               <p>Theſe thinges béeing thus doone, and none remaining there now but <hi>Solco,</hi> reioycing at the metamorphoſing of falſe <hi>Spinalo, Florian</hi> tooke the great Axe, and began to lay ſuch loade there-with vpon the grate, as (in little while) he made a window large enough to get out at, and béeing not ſo warie of <hi>Solco</hi> as the caſe required, (who diſſembled ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute contentment at all which had hapned) he ſnatcht fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him ſuddenly the Baſiliſks ſtone, and ran away ſo ſpéedily there-with, that <hi>Florian</hi> (little inured to ſwiftnes of foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip)
<pb facs="tcp:14347:183"/>
ſcant knew how or which way to follow him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solco</hi> ſtayed not till hee came where the Baſiliſke lay, vpon whoſe head he firſt placed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> creaſt, and then alſo fixed the ſtone therein, where-upon it returned to life againe, but much more furious then it was before. The Lady with <hi>Cauno</hi> &amp; <hi>Silinga,</hi> quickly came thether, and knowing that this would prooue a harder conflict, then any that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Knight had yet endured, they ſtoode all very penſiue, neuertheleſſe, <hi>Silinga</hi> ſaid: Now my Lord, raiſe vp your very ſprightfull valour, for this is the laſt action of the enchauntment.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Florian</hi> heard thoſe words, he felt ſuch a chéerfull vigour diſperſe it ſelfe through his veines, as if (before) hée had not trauailed at all, and aſſayling the Baſiliſke in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight of all his furie and fiercenes, he made him giue back aboue twentie paces: for hauing made triall before ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently of the Knights vertue, hee betooke him to his wonted flying aloft, and ſwéeping often ouer him, at laſt, ſmote him in the Helmet with his tallents in ſuch ſort, that hee fell downe groueling vppon the ground, and but that his flight carried him away ſo ſwiftly, as he could not turne quicklie to ſeaze vppon the Knight, hée muſt néedes haue kild him, ere he could haue riſen vp.</p>
               <p>The qualitie of theſe flights altred the condition of the battaile, the Knight béeing ſtill belowe, and the Baſiliſke aloft, whereby <hi>Florian</hi> ſuſtained many diſaduantages, and loſt diuers good blowes deliuered to no purpoſe: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, lothe to leaue a labour (of ſuch conſequence) vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, and hauing runne through the maine, it were end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſhame to ſhrink now in the rere, he began now to caſt a warie eye on all opportunities, ſuffering the Baſiliſke to beate out his furie, whereof hee had ſo emptied himſelfe in leſſe then an houre, and ſo lagd his wings with ouer tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous labour, that very often hee was readie to fall downe flat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Florian</hi> (not héedleſſe of ſo faire an occaſion) perceiuing him not to bounde aloft with his wonted violence, nor his winges to beare him with ſo ready a flight, purſued euerie
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:14347:183"/>
aduantage, ſtill as it was offered, and (in his turnings) ſo ſliced away his hard ſcailes, that the ſworde made inciſion through fleſh and all.</p>
               <p>When the Baſiliſke felt himſelfe mortally wounded, and that his former ſtrength was much impaired, he would now part with his life at a very diſperate aduenture, and flewe againſt the Knight with ſo maine a vigour, as if the blow had hit him, it could not be otherwiſe but he had béene ſlaine: but he auoyding it very dexteriouſly, and ſéeing the Baſiliſke falne to the ground, gaue a ſpéedy ſtroake at his creaſt, and downe fell the ſtone againe, whereupon, as hée made offer to flie away thence, <hi>Florian</hi> intercepting him, ſeuerd one of his wings from the body, and likewiſe ſmote off one of his legges, whereat <hi>Solco</hi> growing deſperate to ſee his enchauntment fully concluded, fell downe and dyed with extremitie of gréefe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Daria,</hi> for ſo was the eldeſt Siſter named, with <hi>Cauno</hi> and <hi>Silinga,</hi> were greatly agréeued, to ſée <hi>Solco</hi> theyr Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther die ſo ſuddenlie, but ioy, for ſafe poſſeſſion of their own libertie, excéeded the impreſſure of griefe &amp; paſſion. Gladly would they haue had <hi>Florian</hi> gone with them to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Carpatia,</hi> but he, after he had repoſed himſelfe there foure dayes ſpace, and queſtioned with the Knights reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to their right ſhapes, who (admiring his memorable vertues) were not ſparing of thankes for ſo ineſtimable a benefit receiued: departed thence in ſearch of his daughter, and not knowing which way he rode, tooke directly toward the Ile of <hi>Carderia,</hi> where he remained priſoner among the reſt, onely by the force of the enchauntment.</p>

               <head>CHAP. LVI. Howe <hi>Florendos</hi> combatting with <hi>Leonato,</hi> was carried captiue into the Ile of <hi>Carderia.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Lorendos,</hi> who ſtil followed that way which his mind perſwaded him his Wife was ledde before, trauailed in vain for many daies together, lighting ſtill on ſome aduentures, but none of noate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy marke or qualitie: and finding himſelfe at length to bee in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> he remembred the ſo far-famed aduenture of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deriaes</hi> Ile, and to try if he could giue end thereto or no, hée ſhaped his courſe that way.</p>
               <p>Nowe it happened, that his Sonne <hi>Oliuanto,</hi> whoſe minde ranne on the accompliſhment, of all occaſions what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer the worlde yeelded, or dye with diſgrace in fayling thereof, chaunced likewiſe to iourney that way: but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any enſigne or impreſe, becauſe hee would paſſe as one vnknowne, as in like manner did his Father <hi>Florendos,</hi> and ſo they met both together at the entrance of a Woode, where curteouſly they ſaluted one another. <hi>Oliuanto,</hi> who knew his father to be a good Knight, albeit he little thought that this was he, doubted of this mans going to the Ile of <hi>Carderia,</hi> yet deſirous therein to be reſolued, entring into diſcourſe with him, ſayd.</p>
               <p>You (Sir Knight) that beare ſo faire a preſence, what, are ye trauailing to the Ile of <hi>Carderia?</hi> Yea marie am I Sir, aunſwered <hi>Florendos:</hi> whereupon, <hi>Oliuanto</hi> (ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laying hold on his arme) ſayd. Then Knight you verie much erre and miſtake your ſelfe, if you thinke to be there before me. <hi>Florendos,</hi> not wonted to be ſo iniuried, foorth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with gaue back, ſaying: Thou ſheweſt thy ſelfe a villaine,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:14347:184"/>
and no Knight of gentle bloode, in offering to fore-ſtall the forwardnes of any mans vertue, but I will ſo chaſtiſe thys preſumption in thee, as thou hadſt béene better (with quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes) to haue ſuffered me paſſe from thée. So turning quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie his horſe, he ranne againſt his ſonne, but yet with a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine inward attaindour of griefe, fore-telling ſome fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſadnes to enſue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oliuanto,</hi> by béeing more furious then néeded, fayled in the encounter, but receiued ſuch a welcome, as made him forgoe his ſtirrops, and ſet him in a pretty forwardneſſe of falling: but courage quickning his ſpirits in the ſhocke, kept him ſtill in the ſaddle, and turning gallantly with his ſword drawne, made him giue his Father a wound verie ſhrewdlie, which afterward he not a little lamented, when he came to knowledge of whom he fought withall, for the blow entred ſome-what déepe into his arme, yet he eſcaped not without a iuſt requitall, himſelfe receiuing as much in the right ſide. For two houres ſpace the combate continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, both theyr horſſes being ſo wearied, as they could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtirre vp and downe, and <hi>Florendos</hi> horſe had receiued a hurt in the head, ſo that both were glad to alight, and ſettle themſelues to theyr beſt behauiour.</p>
               <p>Now began they to hacke and hewe their Armour, often catching each other faſt about the middle, to try whethers ſtrength could caſt his enemy: in all which appeared no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther difference, but that <hi>Florendos</hi> had his arme moſt hurt, and by reaſon of his lameneſſe, he ſéemed to treade a little more ſtiffely. Notwithſtanding, both theyr liues had que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſſe there perriſhed, but that the Enchauntreſſe, who ſupported the miſticall ſpell of <hi>Carderiaes</hi> Ile, made an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in this hote ſkirmiſh, ſending <hi>Leonato</hi> to the place where the Knights fought, who ſtepping betweene them, ſaid.</p>
               <p>Lords, it neyther agrées with honour nor armes, that Father and Sonne ſhould ſley each other, therefore all this toyle of yours is fruitleſly beſtowed: for eyther of you is to combate me, who doe guarde the paſſage, where none muſt
<pb facs="tcp:14347:185"/>
obtaine what is onely due to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oliuanto,</hi> béeing vnable to make any euaſion, from the fault which he had ſo peremptorily committed, perceiuing his aduerſary altered to a Father, and compaſſion (for his hurts) to flowe aboundantly from him: ſuppreſt with na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures inward touch, &amp; true feeling of ſo manifeſt a diſgrace, he threw his ſword from him, and proſtrately offered to kiſſe his Fathers foote. But he who was double wounded, both in body &amp; affection, the one not ſtreaming more blood, then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other the intire pitty of a Father: chaining him faſt in his armes, deſired reference for ſuch accomplement till ſitter leyſure, and their Seruaunts (hauing prepared two knightly Béeres) carried them along into <hi>Leonatos</hi> Tent, where the Sorcereſſe cauſed them with all dilligence to be cured, becauſe ſhe would haue none to miſcarry in this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture.</p>
               <p>Eyght daies were ſcarcely paſt, but theyr loſt blood was thorowly recouered, and they found themſelues in ful ſtate of health, ſo that now they began to caſt lotts, whether of them firſt ſhould combate <hi>Leonato:</hi> it fell to <hi>Florendos,</hi> who béeing ſoone armed, came foorth in hope to finiſh the aduenture, and paſſing the Iouſt with <hi>Leonato,</hi> both were diſmounted: then going to the tryall of the ſwordes fight, they hurt one another without regard, which outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of wounding, at length ſo mooued <hi>Florendos</hi> to diſtraction, that (coueting onely the aduentures concluſion) hee ſéemed then to fight with much more diſcretion. And becauſe he would hazard his hopes together, hee caught his aduerſarie about the middle, and carrying him about with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any prouident reſpect, they fell both together (beſide the Bridge) into the Riuer, where <hi>Leonato</hi> getting looſe from him, ſuffered him to be carried into the Iland, and hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned againe, ſwimming to Land: where hardly had hee gotte on ſhoare, but <hi>Oliuanto,</hi> gréeuing that his father was ſurprized by the enchauntment, with his ſword ſette vppon <hi>Leonato,</hi> where now happened as firce a battaile between them two, as euer had beene ſéene before.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:14347:185"/>And although it appeared to <hi>Oliuantos</hi> iudgement, that euery ſtroke of his enemy right ſharply wounded him, yet reſolute courage made him careleſſe thereof, becauſe he felt not his breath to faile him: but earneſtnes ſwaying him more then heedfulnes, and his aduerſary ſtill driuing him toward the Ile, no ſooner ſet he footing vpon the Bridge, but the wonted violent winde ſeazed vppon him, and quicklie conueied him into the Iland, where ſeeing himſelfe among ſo many good Knights together, hee coulde not deuiſe what was beſt for him to thinke of it, albeit this was the general ſuppoſition and doubt among them, that this impriſonment of theyrs, would prooue the ruine of the whole <hi>Grecian</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</p>
               <p>The Squires that attended on <hi>Florendos</hi> and <hi>Oliuanto,</hi> noating ſuch ſucceſſe as others before in theyr Maiſters had ſéene, returned to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where they declared the miſhaps befalne to theyr Lords, which cauſed ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet thorow the whole Court, that the Emperour <hi>Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon</hi> was readie to die with conceite of griefe, ſéeing he had ſo loſt his Sonne and his two Nephewes. But thys ſad ſtorme was indifferently ouer-blowne, when the Armie from <hi>Turkie</hi> arriued there, with <hi>Floraman</hi> and <hi>Dragonalte,</hi> who firſt of all aduertiſed the Emperour, of the warres ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe at the ſiedge of <hi>Niquea,</hi> the death of <hi>Dirdan,</hi> and pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of all troubles in <hi>Turkie:</hi> letting him vnderſtande withall, the departure of <hi>Florendos, Florian,</hi> and <hi>Berolde,</hi> for regaining of <hi>Miragarda, Victoria,</hi> and <hi>Argentina,</hi> who were ſtrangely ſhewne to them, by an Enchauntreſſe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Druſa Velonna,</hi> according as the wiſe <hi>Aliarte</hi> before had told them.</p>
               <p>Then did the Emperour requite their ſad diſcourſe, with report of his Nephewe <hi>Primaleons</hi> reputed death, as alſo ſuch Knights, as were before impriſoned there, among whom <hi>Florendos</hi> and <hi>Oliuanto</hi> now holpe to make vp the number. <hi>Oltrando</hi> of <hi>India</hi> was brought to the Emperour, and kiſſing his hand, ſware loyall alleagiance to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of <hi>Constantinople.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14347:186" rendition="simple:additions"/>During the time of theſe ſo little pleaſing reports, there arriued from the <hi>Perrillous Ile</hi> a Sonne of <hi>Argentaoes,</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Saraſto,</hi> and hee gaue addition of the heauie tydings, howe the wizzard <hi>Aliarte,</hi> was by a Witch ſhutte vp in an yron Cage, and faſtened to a Mountaine hanging ouer the Sea, whereas no other Land could be diſcerned: and when any Shyppe came to ſuccour him, if they drew within leſſe then halfe a miles diſtance of him, ſuddainly hee would be ſnatcht away in ſuch ſtrange manner, as no way could be imagined howe to come at him.</p>
               <p>Theſe newes toucht neerer then all the other, and made his Maieſtie readie to droope downe dead: nor could the Empreſſe and the Ladies conceale theyr paſſions, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing loſt the onely anchor-hold of their comfort: and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſome ſtrange inconuenience had happened in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Court, but that at thys very inſtant (as good happe would haue it) a Letter was ſéene come floating on the Sea into the Port, which béeing directed to the Emperour, was (by the finder of it) brought ſtraite to his Maieſtie, who knowing it to be the wiſe <hi>Aliartes</hi> hande writing, right ioyfully opened it, the contents whereof in order followeth.</p>

what meanes hee might vanquiſh ſo many Monſters, and gaine his entrance into the Tower. As thus he ſtoode pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering on the likelieſt perſwaſions, the Knight how the Wood came to him againe vnto him, ſaying. Prepare your ſelfe Sir, in regard you are forth-with to be aſſayled: and becauſe your life is not to miſcarie in this enterpriſe, take this direction from me: theſe Caniballs defence conſiſts on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie of their faces, therefore make thereat your marke and ayme, and ſo be aſſured to part with victorie.</p>

                  <hi>Primaleon</hi> preſently armed him ſelfe, &amp; taking his ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, went forth of the Cottage, where beholding not any one to offer him reſiſtance, hee ſtoode beating againſt that part of the wall, where before hee had made ſome ſlender rupture, and ſuch were the blowes he gaue, that the fracture extended it ſelfe now aboue an hand breadth, more then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it had done, from which labour he was quickly coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termaunded, by ſixe Caniball brethren, who were come to reuenge the death of their father: wherefore bethinking him ſelfe of the Knights former aduiſe, he made a thruſt full at the noſe of one them, paſſing the ſword quite vp into his braine, whereby he fell downe dead at his foote. The other peſtered about him terribly with their Clubbes, but ſtill as they were hurt in the face, they fled away from him toward the Wood, where turning back at the very entraunce, they did nothing but ſtand barking at him, ſo that there he ſlew two of them, and the reſt ran away wounded.</p>

This gladded him (not a little) that he had wounded the beaſt, hauing giuen aboue twenty o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtrokes at him, yet could by no meanes enter his ſkin, which putting him now in ſome hope of victory, made him watchfull of like aduantage, for his further hurting: but by reaſon his hornes were ſtill dangerous to him, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraind to keepe off, and ſpend many a ſtroke in vaine, till more auayling ſucceſſe might better ſted him.</p>
               <p>Now grew the battaile to ſuch deſperate condition, that <hi>Primaleon</hi> (like one prodigall of life and honour) ſet downe his reſt on the vtmoſt hazard, and holding his Partezanes ſtaffe on the ground, with good regard to the beaſts fury, his minde halfe perſwaded him, that good hap would direct his ſwords point, to the very tendreſt part of the Monſters ſkin, as in deede it followed in the proofe: for the weapon entred vnder the blade of the ſhoulder, and paſſed along to his very heart, whereon the beaſt ſtaggerd toward him, which the knight perceauing, leapt off from him, elſe had he falne full vpon him, and ſo might haue endangerd him by his huge weight: the Lady not a little glad of ſuch ſucceſſe, ſayde. Sir Knight, let vs returne the ſame way we entred, ſo ſhall we get forth of the Tower, otherwiſe, there is no place for reſting you, but the Caniballs wil fiercely againe ſet on ye. <hi>Primaleon</hi> followed her direction, and then they beheld the Tower to open, iuſt on the ſame ſide where he had entred, ſo they iſſued forth, and went into the afore-ſaid Cabben or Cottage, euen as the Sunne was at his deſcending: fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding there the table ready furniſhed, and two goodly beds ſeuerally to reſt in, which (to him) ſeemed highly pleaſing. Then entred hee into conſideration of the Lady, reputing her to be of quality and greatnes, by making ſuch eſteeme of him in this enchauntment: but hee might not knowe of whence or what ſhe was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe the force of the Magicke would not admit it: notwithſtanding, among ſome other gentle conference, ſhe ſpake to the Knight in this manner. Moſt euident and apparant is it, what happy fortune <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merin
<pb facs="tcp:14347:189"/>
d' Oliua</hi> left to his of-ſpring, in that your gracious ſtarres pleaſed to guide your hand, to the onely direct place for confounding the beaſt, which elſe, all the ſtrength in the worlde could not haue conquered. But to morrowe, there remaines a farre greater aduenture for ye, as neuer could you deſire a matter of more eſteeme: thereby may you gaine an vnguent, which can cure the Emperour <hi>Primaleon, Don Edward</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and your father <hi>Florendos,</hi> marie the purchaſe of it, will coſt you much labour and perill, &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps will make you repent, that euer you vndertooke it. So excéeded <hi>Primaleons</hi> ioy, that theſe Princes (by his meanes) might be recouered, as he thought euery houre a yéere till the next day came, and hauing ſupped, he went to his reſt, vntill the bright morning early ſaluted him, when beeing riſen, hee found the Lady in deuoute prayer for his ſafety. Nowe began he to conſider with him ſelfe, that the Sledge or Hammer might ſtand him in ſome ſted, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore taking it vp on his neck, he went to the place where he iſſued foorth, which he found to be open, and (dreadleſſe of any perill) he entred with the Lady, who (for her ſecurity) kept ſtill by his ſide.</p>
               <p>No ſooner were they entred, but the wide-open rift clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed againe, and then began the terribleſt noyſe that euer was heard, which all the remayning Caniballs made to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as they came deſcending downe the ſtaires: but <hi>Primaleon,</hi> to kéepe ſo many brutiſh ſauages off him, laid at them with his Partezane, oppoſing him ſelfe at the foote of the ſtaires, where making his ayme ſtill at their faces, at laſt he wounded the oldeſt of them, vpon whoſe life depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the enchauntment of the Tower, and the weapon paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing quite thorowe his braines, immediatly he fell downe dead, where preſently the wall of mettall ſunke déepe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ground, and <hi>Primaleon</hi> ſtoode with the Lady on the lowe pauement, ſome-what abaſhed, becauſe they behelde ſuch a ſtrange alteration. As they ſtaide there ſtill to ſee what would enſue, they ſawe the top of a goodly houſe ariſe out of the earth, and afterward the walls &amp; gate appeared,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:14347:189"/>
ouer which was written in golden Letters as followeth: <hi>The houſe of the fayre princeſſe <hi>Melia,</hi> wher-into whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer enters, looſeth his life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Primaleon</hi> ſmyled at this ſeuere threatning, and taking vp his great hammer, went to beate againſt the gate there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pauſing a little, he heard a noyſe of people with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as if it were of ſuch as meant to defend it: neuertheleſſe, the ſtrength of the blowes he layd on it were ſuch, that the gate ſhaking and tottering euery way, at laſt fell downe, and <hi>Primaleon</hi> receiued ſuch a ſounde gréeting on the head, as (if he had not ſuddenly ſet the hammer to the ground, for his ſupport) he had lyen along, but ſtout courage neuer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking him, boldly made him leape forward in at the gate, where he was immediatly ſnatcht vp in the armes of two Giants, who carried him by méere ſtrength to an Altare, which ſtood not farre off from the entrance, and then one of them ſayd. Let vs ſacrifice this man héere, to the ſoule of the Princeſſe <hi>Melia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Agréed (quoth the other) and his hammer that lyes yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, will greatly ſtedde vs, to breake his bones in péeces at a blow. Thou ſaiſt true (quoth the firſt Giant) therefore goe fetch it, and leaue the Knight alone to mée. <hi>Primaleon</hi> perceiuing in what danger he was, drawing ſuddenly his dagger, gaue the Giant (that held him) a ſtabbe in the ſide, which made him let goe his holde, and <hi>Primaleon</hi> recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his feete, got foorth his ſword, and layd about him ſo fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly there-with, that the Giant found hee had no idle la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in hand.</p>
               <p>By this time was the other come with the hammer, which ſéemed of no poyſe or weight in his hand, ſo hée with that, and the other with his huge Club, layd at the Knight with ſuch furie and violence, as neuer before was he in the like perrill: for he beheld it moſt euidently, that if he auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not the blowes of the hammer, his life muſt there im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly perriſh, beſide, the other ſo canuaſt him with his Clubbe, that hee ſtaggard héere and there like a drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: and ſcarce knowing in this extremitie howe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue
<pb facs="tcp:14347:190"/>
himſelfe, he ſet his backe againſt the Altare, to kéepe both his enemies directly before him, when calling to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce, howe much héere-to-fore thruſts and foynes had befriended him, hee did nothing elſe but giue out-right thruſts and ſtabbes, which made the Giants kéepe the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off from him, but hee was ſo ſpent and ouer-laboured in this combate, that the end of the fight ſéemed doubtful vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.</p>
               <p>The Giant that fought with the hammer, grewe ſo out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious and tranſported with violence, that his blowes flew about without any diſcretion, beating the ground, and dooing no harme elſe, till meere furie made the hammer ſlippe ſuddenly out of his hande, ſo that then hee was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to be-take himſelfe to his Clubbe again: in which ſmall opportunitie, <hi>Primaleon</hi> (with a thruſt) had hurt the other Giant in the face, where-uppon hee retired backe to the Altare, and vaniſhed preſently out of ſight.</p>
               <p>Then to kéepe play with the other, leaſt by breathing he ſhould grow freſh and luſtie, he followed him cloſe euerie way about: but he ſéeing his companion was gone, and that the Knight very hardly ſet him, did what hee could to with-ſtand his enemie, till receiuing likewiſe a maine thruſt in the face, he quickly fled after his fellow.</p>
               <p>Nowe went <hi>Primaleon</hi> (as glad of a little reſt) to leane awhile againſt the Altare, but thereof hee was preuented, for he ſawe come foorth from vnder the Altare, two Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents hiſſing, appearing as if they were knit together. <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maleon</hi> conſidered with himſelfe, that as the one Giant fledde, ſo the other fayled in his ſtrength, therfore he would fight with one of the Serpents firſt, hoping his ſucceſſe that way would prooue the like: but they were ſo cloſely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined together, as he knewe not by what meanes to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe his intent, whereupon, hée aymed with thruſts at them both, which with theyr winges they ſtill put by, and gaue him many a violent ſtroke.</p>
               <p>While this fight thus continued, he heard the clattering of Armour, as if he were to be aſſailed by an hoſte of men,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:14347:190"/>
a matter wrought by force of the enchauntment, onelie to diſmay and terrifie his thoughts: but hee made no recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of all this terrour, becauſe he was prepared for anie danger whatſoeuer, ſéeking firſt to end the taſke he had in hand, and deliuered ſuch a ſtroke at the one Serpent, as (lighting where the winges were ioyned to the bodie,) did cutte them quite off, and then redoubling the blowe with a thruſt, ranne him quite through the head, whereby hee fell downe, paſt all abilitie of harming any more: which did ſo lagge and wearie the other yet liuing, to defend himſelfe, and dragge the other Serpent about to, as the Knight (ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king aduantage offered) diſpatcht him after his fellow for company.</p>
               <p>Nowe thought <hi>Primaleon</hi> that his labour was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and going to the Altare, he eſpied (in an yron Cheſt) a Boxe of ſtone, preſerued there from the knowledge of any one, which (when he had broken the yron Cheſt) he purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to beare thence away with him: and as hee procéeded with this intent, hee beheld the figure of a Woman vppon the Altare, whoſe yéeres of age ſéemed to be about fiftie, which as he ſtoode awhile beholding, the figure beganne to ſpeake to him in this manner.</p>
               <p>Perhaps thou thinkeſt (Sir Knight) to carry hence this vnguent, which I neuer made for any Chriſtians helpe, but for the race of <hi>Armato,</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and my brother: if ſuch be thy perſwaſion, it is méerely in vaine. At which words, ſuddenly aroſe a Table before the Altare, where vnder (as in a déepe Cauerne) were to be ſeene Beares, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Wolues, Tygers, Panthers, &amp; diuers wilde beaſts, then ſpake the Image againe, ſaying: Thou muſt firſt fight with theſe and ouer-come them, before thou canſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine thy deſire.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Primaleon</hi> perceiued ſuch an ineuitable danger, he conferred with his thoughts, which way were the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt to compaſſe victory, then did the Table on a ſuddaine deſcend againe, and he beheld there a locke with a key, and a Trumpet hanging by it: Héere-vpon came the Ladie to
<pb facs="tcp:14347:191"/>
him, who had learned many particularities (concerning the enchauntment) of two young Ladies ſhee met withall in the Tower, and therefore ſpake thus to him againe.</p>
               <p>Locke downe the Table with that key Sir Knight, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it onely is the doore of the Cauerne: then ſound the Trumpet, for therein conſiſts the meanes of ending the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chauntment. <hi>Primaleon</hi> was not ſlowe in locking it downe with the key, and taking the Trumpet in his hand, meant to ſound it: but a Spirit excéeding any humane ſtature, came and caught hold of him, and a very ſtrange kinde of wraſtling grew betweene them, for <hi>Primaleon</hi> could faſten no hold on the Spirit, but was ſo violently hurld about eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie way by this phantaſma, as very hardly could he keepe himſelfe on his féete, but ſupporting himſelfe ſo well as hée could, he ſounded the Trumpet, and then the Spirit vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in a ſmoake, likewiſe all the wilde beaſtes beneath in the vault, breaking a doore on the Mountaines ſide, ranne altogether mainly thence, to be out of the trumpets dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full noyſe.</p>
               <p>Nowe remained the Altare without any defender, and <hi>Primaleon</hi> turning to thanke the Lady for her good aduiſe, preſently knew her to be his Mother <hi>Miragarda,</hi> whom the enchauntments force would not let him know till now, and ſhee not a little ioyfull of his preſence, ſayd.

               <p>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:14347:191"/>The one of the young Ladies ſtept vnto him, and ſhewed him how he ſhould vndoe (by ſtrength) an yron barre, that was faſtened a hand breadth aboue the Cheſt, and there he ſhould find the key to open it. <hi>Primaleon,</hi> though he thought it vnpoſſible by might to vndoo it, yet becauſe he was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thus aduiſed, kneeling downe cloſe to it, hee beganne to pull thereat with ſuch force, as was fore-graunted to the race of great <hi>Palmerin,</hi> euen as if his veines and ſinnewes had crackt in ſunder, and getting off the barre, a little key ſtarted foorth, which <hi>Dorina</hi> tooke to her, becauſe <hi>Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon</hi> was falne into a ſwoune, by the extreame labour of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening the barre.</p>

               <p>Know then, if you would finde the faire Lady <hi>Victoria,</hi> ſhee remaines enchaunted in the Pallace of the Princeſſe <hi>Melia,</hi> euen there, where the Lady <hi>Leonarda</hi> was ſo long detained: but if you would (you cannot) be her deliuerance, till firſt you haue fréed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> impriſonment, almoſt the whole band of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Knights, as alſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wizzart <hi>Aliarte,</hi> who is kept in ſuch a hard and narrow ſtraite, as except he be ſette at libertie, and his ayde mightily aſſiſting you, no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane power can compaſſe what you are to paſſe thorowe.

and the precious oyntment.</p>
               <p>It grieued <hi>Primaleon</hi> not a little, to heare his beloued <hi>Victoria</hi> was enchaunted, and that her deliuerance might not foorth-with be vndertaken, wherfore, when the houre of dinner was come, they feaſted againe merily together, and no ſooner were they riſen from the Table, but they eſpied a Knight come riding vnder the wood ſide, whom <hi>Primaleon</hi> (vnarmed) went forth to méet: the Knight béeing <hi>Trineus,</hi> when <hi>Primaleon</hi> drew néerer him, he preſently knew him, and raiſing vp his beuer, alighted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his horſe, enterchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging kind embraces and ſalutations together. <hi>Primaleon</hi> remembring the olde Knights wordes, and couetous to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the height of his diſſeignes, ſaid: Moſt honoured <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus,</hi> if euer you loued me, expreſſe it now, in granting me one requeſt, which not onely will much enlarge your repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but likewiſe redound to my Lord the Emperours e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeciall contentment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Trineus,</hi> not knowing what hee would enioyne him to, without any exception, franckly graunted it: whereupon, <hi>Primaleon</hi> taking him by the hand, walked on with him to the Cottage, where hee greatly meruailed to behold <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garda,</hi> but beeing reſolued in all the paſſed accidents, <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maleon</hi> thus procéeded.

               </p>
               <p>This ſo ſpéedie returne, greatly diſcontented <hi>Trineus,</hi> becauſe his thoughts laboured on the aduenture in the Ile of <hi>Carderia:</hi> but reſpect of honor ſtrictly tied him to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, whereupon the old Knight made ready two faire Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, placing the Princeſſe <hi>Miragarda</hi> in one of them, and the two Ladies in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other, himſelfe likewiſe mounted on a

Heauen be praiſed (faire Daughter) that I ſee thée in ſafety, nowe hope I that my Court ſhall recouer her former floure and maieſtie.</p>
               <p>By this time <hi>Don Edward</hi> was come likewiſe to them, who (not a month before) arriued there from <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Trineus</hi> ſtepping forward to ſalute his moſt eſtéemed friends, taking either of them by the hand, thus ſpake to the Emperour. Be of good comfort (moſt ſacred Maieſtie,) for your Nephew <hi>Primaleon</hi> is in good eſtate of health, and hath ſent vnto ye the ſoueraigne vnguent, which the fayre Princeſſe <hi>Melia</hi> her ſelfe did make, for the cure of her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Armato</hi> King of <hi>Perſia</hi> and his race: and hath wone it by no meane hazards and endeuour, wherefore he ſends it, to heale Prince <hi>Edward</hi> and your ſelfe, of thoſe vnrecured hurts which doe yet annoy you.

               <p>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:14347:193"/>Neuertheleſſe (quoth ſhée) beleeue it as a matter moſt certaine, that they ſhall both be ſet at liberty: the one by <hi>Primaleon,</hi> after he hath giuen end vnto two great enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes, and the other, by the noble Prince <hi>Florian.</hi> Then preſented they to his Highnes the auncient Knight, whoſe name was <hi>Helizabat,</hi> ſometime the huſband to the wiſe Enchauntreſſe <hi>Vrganda,</hi> and now ſo aged, that his yéeres amounted to aboue two hundred: as he made offer of knée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to the Emperour, his Maieſtie (mooued by ſo reuerend an aſpect) helde him vp in his armes, deſirous to knowe of whence and what he was, wherein him ſelfe ſo diſcréetly reſolued him, as both he and <hi>Don Edward</hi> were highly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, vnderſtanding by him ſo many ſtrange matters paſt, as alſo diuers other that were to enſue.</p>
               <p>Theſe and ſuch like diſcourſings beguiled the time, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they were arriued at the Pallace, where the Emperour and <hi>Don Edward,</hi> to honour the reuerend age of olde <hi>Heli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabat,</hi> would néedes (by each hand) guide him vp the ſteps, when happened (by the vnguent) a matter almoſt miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous: for within leſſe then an houres ſpace, the Emperour ſtird at pleaſure his ſtiffe benummed arme, féeling it in as good eſtate as euer, and <hi>Don Edward</hi> turning to ſee the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours happy recouerie, felt his head (leaning before a ſide vpon his ſhoulder) to ſtand vp right and mooue as readily, as if it had neuer beene in any ſuch condition, to the wonder and amazement of all the beholders.</p>
               <p>Now to expreſſe the feaſting and reuelling thorowe the Citty, for ioy of theſe ſo happy euents, is a thing whereof I am no way capable: but let it ſuffiſe, that Princes (ruling by iuſtice and humanity) doo reach ſo far into their ſubiects harty affections, as continually they receaue from them the tribute of ſo gracious deſeruing, yea, ſometimes with an ouer-flowing largeſſe and bounty, as people right proude of their Soueraignes loue and kindnes. Such was the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ioy in <hi>Constantinople</hi> at this time, man, woman, and child applauding <hi>Trineus,</hi> for bringing thether that vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous oyntment: but much more they extolled the Knight of
<pb facs="tcp:14347:194"/>
Fortune, whoſe honourable labours had obtayned it. <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus,</hi> whoſe deſire was after ſtrange aduentures, the next day conferred with <hi>Bazillia,</hi> concerning the gouernment of <hi>Allmaigne,</hi> and taking leaue of her, without vſing a word to any other, being armed, he departed from the Citty, cary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no deuiſe or impreſe, becauſe hee purpoſed to trauaile vnknowne: ſo rode hee toward the Ile of <hi>Carderia,</hi> where hee arriued within fewe dayes after, ioyfull and glad be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond conceite, that <hi>Primaleon</hi> was not come thether before him, making no doubt of finiſhing the aduenture, by helpe of the Iewell he bare about him, which kept him ſafe from all enchauntments.</p>
               <p>Staying ſome little while a-loofe from the place, to eaſe his Horſe (well néere ſpent with trauaile) at length when he ſawe time beſt befitting him, he went toward <hi>Leonatos</hi> pauillion, euen as he had newly vanquiſhed a ſtrange er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Knight. Without any idle or talking daliance, they made triall of the Iouſt, and ſuch was the encounter, as <hi>Leonato</hi> loſt his ſtirrops, and <hi>Trineus</hi> was lifted out of his ſaddle on the trooper of his Horſe, very hardly kéeping him ſelfe from falling: but recouering his ſeate againe quickly, he came againſt his enemie with his ſword drawne, who entertayned him with as chéerefull a ſpirit, <hi>Trineus</hi> hauing this aduantage in the fight (beyonde all the reſt) that no hurts or wounds appeared to him, as to the former aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers they vſually did, which onely was cauſed by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his Iewell. The combate continued aboue two houres, and there might they haue fought two dayes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or elſe haue miſcaried by wearines, their equality of valour was ſo correſpondent, and their knowledge in fight ſo aunſwerable, as (albeit they did little harme to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) yet grew they breathleſſe and quite tired.</p>
               <p>Now the Sorcereſſe, not coueting the death of any knight in this aduenture, knowing no other meanes to appeaſe this contention, ſent forth a Damoſell heauily countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, wrapt in a mantle of white Satten, ritchly fringed with gold, ſitting in a ſaddle of gréene veluet, on a very gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:14347:194"/>
Palfray ſumptuouſly capariſoned, and comming to them with mournfull deiected lookes, ſhe ſpoke in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Which of you (faire Lords) will take pitty on an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Lady, to whom hath happened a diſgrace beyond compariſon, and onely through the fault of a falſe and moſt diſloyall Knight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leonato,</hi> being tied by the enchauntments power to that place, leaſt any ſhould come to end the aduenture, tooke no héede of her wordes: but <hi>Trineus,</hi> (exempt from ſuch an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-ruling oppreſſion) taking compaſſion on the Damoſels teares, ſaid. Sir Knight, ſince I perceaue no ſuch readines in you, I will goe reuenge the wrong of this iniuried Lady. Thats nothing to me (aunſwered <hi>Leonato</hi>) nor will I be offended whether you goe or ſtay: onely the charge impoſed on me, is to kéepe any man whatſoeuer from concluding this aduenture. Vpon this reply, <hi>Trineus</hi> turnd his Horſe, and rode thence with the Damoſell, of whom he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer learne whether ſhe would conduct him, but ſtill ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed him on a whole moneth together, and ſo farre from the Ile of <hi>Carderia,</hi> as he could not returne thether againe, before the expiration of the aduenture.</p>
               <p>But come wee nowe to <hi>Primaleon,</hi> who parting with his Mother, as you haue already heard, entred conference with <hi>Dorina,</hi> concerning his beſt meanes, for arriuing at the Ile of <hi>Carderia</hi>: ſhee (as one well acquainted with the nature of the enchauntment) tolde him, that hee ſhoulde haue néede of the great Hammer, which taking with them, and entering afterwarde into their little Barque, they ſayled thence away, and came to the Riuer which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>girted the Ile of <hi>Carderia.</hi> But before theyr departure, <hi>Primaleon</hi> well liking <hi>Dorinaes</hi> aduiſe, made a déepe ſearch before the Pallace, and founde there a huge wide Caue or pitte, wherein hee behelde a number of the dead Cani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balles, as alſo a Golgatha of dead mens bones: by it lay the great Hammer, which hee caſting on hys ſhoulder, went aboorde with <hi>Dorina,</hi> launching out thence into the maine Sea, with earneſt deſire to reach the Ile of <hi>Carderia:</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14347:195"/>
and ſcarſely were they entred the Barque, but the waters grew ſo outragious and turbulent, as <hi>Dorina</hi> knew not by her Arte the reaſon thereof: yet more and more the tempeſt encreaſed, the Shippe often times ready to ſplit in ſunder. At length, drawing néere vnto the Iland, where <hi>Primaleon</hi> reputing more ſafety to be on land then on the water, hee ſuddainly leapt out on the ſhoare, the Barque putting off againe very expeditiouſly, and he eſpying a goodly Tower in the midſt of the Ile, walked on thether-ward: but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring he had left the great Hammer behinde him, and that <hi>Dorina</hi> tolde him he ſhould haue néede of it, he turned back to goe fetch it. As thus he walked on, <hi>Leonato</hi> eſpied him, who meruailing to ſée him paſſe thus a-long the Iland, contrarie to any of the other before enchaunted, began to thinke with him ſelfe, that this man was likely to finiſh the aduenture, where-vpon, he began to giue him very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurious ſpéeches, challenging him to the triall of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. For all this, <hi>Primaleon</hi> was not offended, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the Bridge, tolde him his name and cauſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thether: for he ſo déerely affected <hi>Leonato,</hi> as he was loath to enter the fight with him, where-vpon they conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not to combate at all. But the Enchauntreſſe, percea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the finiſhing of her Magick ſpells ſo néere at hand, to preuent the ſame as long as ſhe could, ſhée came in perſon betwéene them, ſaying. Knights, farre off are you from the valour of <hi>Polendos</hi> King of <hi>Theſſalie,</hi> who made no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of any perſon whatſoeuer, to attaine the height of his owne diſſeignes.</p>
               <p>Theſe prouoking wordes ſtirred a deſire in eyther of the Knights, preſently to vndertake the combate, and it had likewiſe followed in action, but that <hi>Dorina,</hi> being acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the mighty ſpléenes of them both, which might ſo farre endanger their lyues, as the aduenture thereby would remaine vnperfected, ſuddainly raiſed the Iland water ſo high, as all the bridge was couered there-with, ſo that they had no place for their difference, when the Enchauntreſſe (thus ouer-taken in her owne intent) grewe ſo diſpleaſed
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:14347:195"/>
thereat, as ſhee could not deuiſe what to doo or ſay. The Knights were very willing to haue come together, &amp; practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all the wayes which poſſibly they could: but ſeeing the high water woulde not permit them, <hi>Primaleon</hi> went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Iland, and <hi>Leonato</hi> held it now for certaine, that <hi>Primaleon</hi> was ſo reſpected by Fortune, as he onely ſhould extirpate the enchauntment, for this enchauntment of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinaes</hi> (fore-ſtalling the other) gaue him good reaſon ſo to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine, ſo went he to his Tent againe.</p>

Think not Sir Knight, that this great enchauntment was made to ruinate the Court of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> but this is the reaſon of it: the laſt of thoſe thrée Fairies, which holy great <hi>Palmerin</hi> to the precious water, kept on the mountaine <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiferia,</hi> was our Aunt, and left héere as ſtrange an enchaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as euer was heard of, yet with ſuch a condition, that it ſhould be concluded by one of <hi>Palmerins</hi> progenie, and
<pb facs="tcp:14347:196"/>
there are other aduentures beſide left by that Fairie, which will renowne that family to all poſterities.</p>

Then did the Enchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe and the Knight guide him from the Tower, to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine quarter of the Iland, where (without bidding him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diew) they ſuddainly left him, as fearefull of a ſauage wilde Beare, which kept in a Wood very néere adioyning. <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maleon</hi> helde on his way into the Wood, which he found to
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:14347:196"/>
be maze-like and full of turnings, thicke ſette with great Oakes, broade ſpreading Elmes, and other goodly trées, as if no Axe had euer come neere them: and becauſe their thick braunches hindered his paſſage, he beate them downe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him with his Hammer, ſo that his blowes were eaſily heard quite through the Iland, and when (by much labour) he had gone about halfe a mile by eſtimation, he came forth into a faire plaine, about forty paces euery way in large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, where ſtanding to beholde a curious Fountaine, ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly ruſhed foorth the ſauage Beare, which hee neyther hearing nor perceauing, the beaſt reard vp vpon his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, &amp; gript him ſo ſtrongly about the midſt, as he thought there was no way now to eſcape with life, becauſe he could not turne to hurt the beaſt in any place, he held him ſo forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly betwéene his huge pawes.</p>
               <p>As hee ſtrugled and ſtroue to get looſe from the Beare, by chaunce he got vp one of his armes, and catching one of the beaſts eares faſt in his hand, he hung thereon ſo maine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, as willingly the Beare let goe his holde: but he had ſo ſoyled and anoyed the Knight with his frothy foame &amp; ſlaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that he was ouercome with the foule ſent and dampe thereof, falling to the ground bereft of his ſences. But For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune protecting him as her déere eſtéemed fouorite, made the Beare drag him along to the Fountaine, and tumbling him into it, ſuch was the vertue of the water, as the filth being waſhed off him, hee found him ſelfe very freſh and luſty, whereby hee gathered, that this water would ſted him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Beare, whenſoeuer he ſought in that manner to ſtifle him again. So leaping out of the Fountaine, he made toward the Beare, which now held off, and would not come néere the water, then aſſayling him with his ſworde, the beaſt ranne at him on ſuch an aduantage, that paſſing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene his legs, he once more ouer-threw him, giuing him many violent ſtrokes with his pawes, &amp; foaming vpon him as he did before, had almoſt choakt his ſences again, but that recouering vpon his féet, he threw himſelfe quickly into the water, &amp; becam quite altered from his ſenceleſſe ſurprizing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14347:197"/>This ſtrife thus continuing the ſpace of two houres, the Knight grew doubtfull of his ſucceſſe, becauſe he could giue no wound to the Beare, his courſe of aduantage preuailed ſo ſtill againſt him: at length, he deuiſed howe to caſt the beaſt into the water, thinking that way to rid him of his ſo noyſome foaming, and determining héere-vpon reſolutely, he trauerſed about, awayting opportunity, till the Beare was reard vp againe on his hindmoſt legges, when taking him at that aduantage about the middle, the beaſt likewiſe caught him faſt about the neck. Heere found he now work enough to doo, and neuer in all his life did hee endure like trauaile, for the Beare vſed all his might not to come néere the Fountaine, and <hi>Primaleon</hi> ſtroue as ſtifly to bring him thether. Aboue halfe an houre this kinde of wraſtling la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, and <hi>Primaleon</hi> being face to face with the Beare, his breath and filthy driuell entred through the ſight of his hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, making him almoſt as mad and furious as the beaſt, which prooued the onely way for him to gaine the victorie: for ſeeming nowe rather like a franticke body, then a man poſſeſſed of any ciuill parts, he tooke vp the Beare by very méere ſtrength, and carying him forcibly to the Fountaine, they both fell together into the water, where each of them forſaking his former hold, the water caried them one from another, and tooke away all their fury and madnes. The Beare was the firſt that got out of the Fountaine, reſting him ſelfe vpon the bank ſide, but with ſuch a milde and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle look, as witneſſed his ſauage nature to be quite changed. <hi>Primaleon</hi> came out of the water farre off from the Beare, and prepared once againe to aſſaile him, but beholding him to ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>and ſo ſtill and quiet, he drew the néerer him, when he might perceaue the beaſt to beckon him with his pawe, as ſeeming that hee would haue the Knight to followe him, which he not refuſing to doo, tooke vp his Hammer vpon his ſhoulder, and the Beare (leading him a narrowe crooked path) brought him at length to an auncient building, which ſeemed to haue beene ſometime a goodly Tower or Caſtell, but it was now déepe ſunke into the earth, ſo that not aboue
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:14347:197"/>
the ground was to be ſéene of it, the quantitie of more then ſixe foote in height. Paſſing round about it, he eſpied a doore made all of Glaſſe, with a key ready placed in the lock, by the tranſparance whereof, they diſcerned within, a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell furniſhed round with Idols, in the midſt of it ſtood the ſtatue of a Giant, with a mightie Axe in his hand, and ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to menace ſuch as durſt offer to enter at the doore.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Primaleon</hi> being thorowly perſwaded in his minde, that he ſhould abſolutely finiſh the aduenture, ſince hee had ſo well ridde the Beare of his wilde ſaluage nature: went to the doore and tooke downe the key, and ſcarce had hee halfe turnd it in the locke, but the doore opened, &amp; he felt a beaſt to glide in betweene his legges, but ſaw not what it was, wherefore he went toward the Image with the Axe, which at the firſt ſight ſeemed to be immooueable, neuertheleſſe, it ſtirrd and came againſt him, and ſmiting with the Axe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his Shield, brake his impreſe of Fortune quite thorow the midſt, which <hi>Primaleon</hi> tooke as a bad preſage or augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, imagining thereby that Fortune had forſaken him, whereas (indeede) the reaſon of it was, that he ſhould now ſtand vpon his valour and manhoode, without expecting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fauour from Fortune, who (notwithſtanding) left him no more now, then before ſhée had doone in his very grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt perrils.</p>
               <p>This blow ſhewed him how he ſhould gouerne himſelfe againſt the Idole, wherefore beſtirring himſelfe rounde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout as occaſion beſt ſerued, and deliuering diuers ſtroakes at the Idoll, the ſword ſtill rebounded backe, and did no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther harme, albeit the Image was vnarmed: but hee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing the Axe had too much aduantage againſt his ſword, began to awaite ſome apter meanes of help, doing nothing in meane while but defend the Idols maine ſtrokes, and when the fight had continued aboue an houres ſpace, and no more benefite receiued by his labour, then he had at the firſt, he found himſelfe to be ſo ouer-trauailed, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee could not ſhunne a blow which ſmote him on the head, and made him fall backward in a ſwoune.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14347:198"/>Vpon this aduantage, the Idoll caught him vp in his armes, and ran a pace with him behind an Altare, where was a great fire readie prepared, and there the Idol ſtroue to caſt him in: but by this time his ſences were wel againe reſtored, and his good happe was ſuch, that (in the fall) he lighted on his feete, and leaping quickly out of the fire, layd about him luſtily vppon the Idoll, who wanting the Axe, ſtoode ſtill and ſtirrd not, like an Image of ſtone.</p>
               <p>The Knight hauing beſtowed many blowes and thruſts, and ſéeing all his endeuour prooued but in vaine, he went toward the Altare, where, as hee offered to aſcend vp the riſing ſteps, he ſaw a fierce dog come foorth from vnder it, and after him another of like reſemblance, but both of them were armed all ouer. At one inſtant they flew very eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vppon him, and ſought to gnaw in ſunder the buckles of his Armour, which he preuented ſo well as he could, though euer-more one of them was vppon his backe, and theyr Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour appeared to be ſtronger then ſtéele. He ſawe that his ſword now ſerued him to ſmall vſe, the dogges did cling ſo neere about him, wherefore he fought with his dagger on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which hee could by no meanes pierce thorow theyr Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour: but one of them rauenouſly gaping before him, hee ſtabd him in at the mouth, and the weapon paſſing through his hart, made him fall downe dead at his feete, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dogge by béeing thus alone, wanted the ſtrength of the enchauntment, which made him draw backe to the great Idoll, as accounting there his place of ſafely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Primaleon</hi> againe began to mount the ſteps, and when he came néere the Altare, hee beheld a Knight to lie there wounded, humbly deſiring mercy at his hands, and he not thinking it to be a phantaſma, gaue forth his hand to raiſe him on his feete, and bring him neerer to the Altare: but as he ſtoode vpon the pauement, his former weake eſtate was ſuddenly changed, and he getting vp the Axe in his hand, began to lay luſtilie at the Knight, with quicker ſpéed and greater cunning, then any the Idoll before had vſed. It much diſpleaſed <hi>Primaleon,</hi> that he had raiſed vp ſo fierce an
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:14347:198"/>
enemie, but ſéeing his owne folly iuſtly ſcourged, he muſt amend it as he can or may, till ſome better occaſion might happen to end all this labour.</p>
               <p>The Knight with the Axe was ſo wondrous ready, that <hi>Primaleons</hi> ſkil very hardly could auoide his ſtrokes, which (albeit they entred not but ſlightly) yet did they paine him very gréeuouſly, and perceiuing he could not get the Knight from the Altare, but when himſelfe retired, the other refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to follow, and the fight (this way) would neuer be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, he (at laſt) ſo doubled and trebled his blowes on the Knight, that hee conſtrained him to mooue from his place, purſuing him ſtill with ſuch ſprightly courage, that the Knight (ayming a dangerous ſtroke at <hi>Primaleon</hi>) y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blow glaunced by in vaine, and the Knights legs ſlipt vnder him, by reaſon the pauement was very ſlippery, ſo fel he downe the ſteppes, and the Axe tumbling out of his handes, he lay there depriued of all further power.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Primaleon</hi> aduaunced his foote vppon him, with full in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to ſmite off his head: but he crauing mercy once more, ſaid: <hi>Sir Knight, if (with life) you meane to eſcape this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chauntment, take vp the Axe, which was made to be the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of this place, for by no meanes elſe can it be compaſſed. Primaleon</hi> taking the Axe in his hand, felt himſelfe ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly fréed from his former wearines, as if he had not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batted at all, and paſſing through the Temple or Chappell, without any other offence or reſiſtance, hee went behinde the Altare to the fire, where-into the Idoll ſo faine would haue caſt him: there hee beheld it gather it ſelfe together, and (by little and little) receiue the ſhape of a Lady, the ſaddeſt in countenaunce that euer was ſeene, ſhée falling on her knées before him, ſaid.</p>
               <p>Moſt euident it is (right woorthy Knight) that in you is contained the whole worlds vertue, for the Enchauntreſſe would not permit till this inſtant, that any of <hi>Palmerin d' Oliuaes</hi> race ſhould come to this aduenture: yet would you haue found toyle enough to vnder-goe it, if you had not béen poſſeſſed of that Axe, which will be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meanes of your happy
<pb facs="tcp:14347:199"/>
victory. While thus ſhee ſpake, the Beare (which loſt his former wildnes) ſtanding vp on his hindermoſt feete, was changed to a Knight, who taking vp a batte of wood which leaued behind the doore, it altered likewiſe to a fayre long ſword, and the humbled Knight (that twiſe before had cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued mercy) became more fierce and violent then euer hée was: with theſe came alſo the dogge and Idoll, and ſet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together very furiouſly vppon <hi>Primaleon,</hi> who vſing one while his Axe, another while his great hammer, kept in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different good play with them, enforcing them to kéep faire and farre off him, till hitting the dogge on the head with his hammer, he tumbled backward and ſtird no more, heereby hee gathered, that all the reſt muſt be wounded in theyr heads, (which he perceiued them to defend with very ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall care) or elſe he ſhould neuer compaſſe his intent.</p>
               <p>But the firſt Knight was ſmote on the head ere he was aware, and preſently hee fell downe bereft of his ſences, now the Idoll, in regard of his great ſtature, had the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter meanes for his defence, the other Knight alſo held out as furiouſly, as when he was before in the ſhape of a Beare, till <hi>Primaleon</hi> ſtriking at him with the Axe, by good hap ſmote the ſword out of his hand, which he ſtooping to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, another blow lighted vppon his head, which made him fall downe as if he had béen dead. Now none remained but the Idoll onely, who made the readieſt turnings and win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, that euer in any fight had beene diſcerned, cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly auoyding euery blow that made any proffer at his head.</p>
               <p>The battaile betwéen them laſted til the euening, when <hi>Primaleon</hi> (perceiuing the Sunne was neere ſetting, and doubtfull leaſt <hi>Leonato</hi> ſhould come thether, and robbe him of ſome part of the honour) hee beganne to labour the more earneſtly, and plyed the Idoll with ſo many quicke doubled ſtrokes, that hitting (at length) where he moſt deſired, hee ſtaggerd diuers wayes, and falling, ſmote <hi>Primaleon</hi> on the ſhoulder, as if a huge Collomne or Coloſſus had light vpon him, ſo that very hardly he kept on his féete, but réeled about as if hee were ſenceleſſe, when the Lady (ioyfullie
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:14347:199"/>
running vnto him, and opening his beuer to giue him aire) ſpake thus cheerefully to him: <hi>Nowe Knight take courage, for the aduenture is accompliſhed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe wordes reuiued him, and as they were going to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Altare, they ſaw it was vaniſhed, &amp; after it ſunck downe the Idoll, whereuppon, the two Knights came to theyr ſences againe, and perceiuing the vaile of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple fall toward the Tower, they knew that <hi>Primaleon</hi> had ended the enchauntment, wherefore comming to him with great humanitie, they kindly embraced him, and guiding him forth, commended his rare vertues as they woorthilie merrited.</p>
               <p>Béeing come neere the Tower, all the impriſoned Knights right ioyfully met him, onely <hi>Arguto</hi> excepted, who had rather haue ended his life there in priſon, then to acknowledge any ſuch benefite at the hand of his enemie: therefore very ſadly he kept behind the reſt, and while they were buſie in their ſalutations and embraces, hee ſlipt by ouer the Bridge, and ſo departed thence.</p>
               <p>Theſe newes were highly diſpleaſing to <hi>Primaleon,</hi> and in all haſt he would haue followed him, but for his Father <hi>Florendos,</hi> and his Brother <hi>Oliuanto,</hi> who forcibly kept him backe with mightie perſwaſions. <hi>Florian, Forzato, Franardo, Almaroll</hi> and the reſt, could neuer enough ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe theyr kindneſſe to him, but béeing all conducted to a ready prepared Table, <hi>Don Roſuell,</hi> who was next in yeeres to <hi>Florendos,</hi> deſired the Enchauntreſſe to acquaint them with the originall of this enchauntment, which had ſo diſtracted the Emperour <hi>Primaleons</hi> thoughts, and left his Court emptie of ſo many gallants: to which requeſt ſhe aunſwered as followeth héereafter.</p>

Let it not ſéeme offenſiue to you, if I diſcouer the ſecretes of this ſoyle to this Knight, whoſe honour and vertue ſo woorthily deſerues it, beyond all other that yet haue come hether: ſo ſitting downe with the two young Ladies, ſhée commaunded the elder of them to tell y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole ſtorie, whereto ſhe obeying, began in this manner.</p>
               <p>Sir Knight, the hard allotted deſtenie to this Damoſell my Siſter, whom you deliuered out of the Temple, hath beene the cauſe of your ſo late-paſſed trauaile, to frée her fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Ile of <hi>Francelina,</hi> which albeit (in ſome ſort) it was wel procéeded in, when <hi>Polendos</hi> gaue beginning to the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe: yet neither did his worth extend ſo farre, nor her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune merrite ſo much happines, as that all his paines could conclude a matter ſo important, ſuch was the weight of her tranſgreſſion, and ſuch the penaltie thereon impoſed. For her ouer-fond tranſgreſſion in neglect of her honour, firſt gaue beginning to the enchauntment, as briefely I wil tel you the manner how.</p>
               <p>The Knight whom you beheld in the ſhape of a Beare, became ſo deepely enamoured of her, that (in hope of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:14347:200"/>
aduiſe and furtherance) he diſcloſed his affection to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Knight, béeing the ſame with whom you lately combat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. During the progreſſe of this amourous purpoſe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my Siſter gaue kind co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſenting, the ſecond Knight (that knew his friends election in loue) neuer minding the faith and obliged dutie in ſuch a caſe required: became himſelfe extreamely affected toward my Siſter, and becauſe he was better practiſed in loues negotiations, and could handle queint dalliances with more pregnancie then his friende, he preuailed ſo farre, that ſhée, like a light-headed wench, (as for the moſt part young Damoſells are no other, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the experience in ſo dangerous a kind of traffique) left off her firſt Louer, and gaue entertainement to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</p>
               <p>Héere now (Sir) is a little leyſure admitted ye, to ſpend ſome ſmal yet néedfull conſideration, in imagining the iuſt griefe of the Knight reiected, (hauing before receiued ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie faire promiſes, and goodly inſtances of her loyall mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that now the day of marriage beeing appointed, for farre were his thoughts from any other baſe purpoſe:) to behold his hopes ſo apparantly abuſed, his intire affect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed, his true meaning bafled, and his choyce now ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die at anothers commaund, euen his, in whoſe truſt he had repoſed his loue and life, geſſe (I ſay) but the ſorrow of ſo highly a wrongd ſoule. Yet neuertheleſſe, bearing all this with more then manly patience, he diſſembled his diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and kept outward appearance of his loue as earneſt as euer, onely to ſée what it would ſort vnto.</p>
               <p>The other falſe and periurd Knight, his ayme was one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at baſe lubricitie, contaminating the fayre and ſpotleſſe chéeke of chaſtitie, without regard of my Siſters honour, or any due reſpect to his owne life. Shee continuing in this hapleſſe kinde of courſe, affecting earneſtly the one, and feigning cunningly with the other, vppon a certaine day, when the Enchauntreſſe had betooke herſelfe to repoſed thoughts, after ſome former ſerious imployment: my Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter went with her Louer into a little thicket, where being
<pb facs="tcp:14347:201"/>
ſet downe together, and ſhee crowning his temples with a flourie chaplet, they fell to amourous purpoſes &amp; purſuites, and (enterchange of faith beeing equally plighted, action confirming theyr former arguing,) the firſt Knight chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſteale vpon them, where ſeeing his ſimplicity ſo hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſly iniuried, in a violent fury he would haue ſlaine them both, but the falſe Knight eſcaped, with a hurt in his breaſt onely, and ſhe making away ſo faſt as ſhe could, was nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly purſued by him with his Rapier drawne. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple knowing her to be their liedge Lords Daughter, aroſe in her defence, and while they layd hold on the Knight, ſhe got with ſafety into the Caſtell.</p>
               <p>Now did the rude multitude ſo threaten the Knight with death, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he (more ouer-come with true ſence of his wrong, then any terrour of theirs could any way elſe mooue him:) fell mad and franticke, byting euery one that held hand vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and they likewiſe became mad by ranckling of his byting. The rumour of my Siſters feare, and the Knights madnes, awaked the ſléeping Sorcereſſe, and ſhe comming foorth at the gate of the Caſtell, euen as my Siſter was paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by, commaunding her to ſtay, woulde néedes know of her the cauſe why ſhe fledde: which ſhe either could not, or would not manifeſt, as lothe to blabbe her owne ſhame, or elſe ouer-poyſed with ſo deſperate an affrightment.</p>
               <p>Whereupon, the Enchauntreſſe going in with her, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the frantique Knight to be brought before her, beeing ſtrongly fettered with cordes &amp; manacles, leaſt any more ſhould be bitten by him: there did hee reueale his true loue to my Siſter, and how immodeſtly hee found her with the falſe Knight, to whom hee had imparted his affection, and ſaid, though not ſo ſufficiently reuenged, as he could haue wiſhed himſelfe, yet had hee left him wounded to death in the Garden.</p>
               <p>No ſooner had hee thus ſpoken, but the wounded falſe Knight was brought before the Sorcereſſe, and to appeaſe the confuſion of iudgements in this caſe, to three diſtinct ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate places the offenders were appointed, vntil the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:14347:201"/>
of the next day enſuing, which beeing come, the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chauntreſſe pronounced this ſentence folowing. Firſt, that my Siſter, for hauing no more reſpect to her female digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, ſhould be confined to burne in a quenchleſſe fire, as a iuſt puniſhment to the heate of her looſenes: and her wounded falſe Louer, ſhould ſo continue without any cure. As for the poore wronged and diſtracted Knight, who (mooued by the méere iuſtice of his loyaltie) was falne into this miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble frenzie, paſt any preſent recouerie, becauſe his madnes had aſſumed the very height of violence: he ſhould be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into a wilde Beare, whoſe nature leanes much to furious madnes. So the Wood and Temple were his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned haunts, and the Fountaine (in compaſſion of him) was there erected, to frée him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that furious frenzie, when ſuch a Knight ſhould happen to come thether, whoſe valour would embolden him, to drag the beaſt into the water.</p>
               <p>Now as concerning the huge Idoll of ſtone, the ſpell al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted thereto, was in this manner, that whenſoeuer any one came thether to end this enchauntment, it ſhould haue the motion of a lyuing man, and the ſtrength of a Gyant. Thus were the Knights aſſigned a lingering death in life, the one by his mortall wound, the other in his tranſ-formed madnes, and my Siſter (who indéede ſhould iuſtly ſuffer for them both) had continually remayned in that fire, except your vertue had allayed the vigour thereof, which ceaſed ſo ſoone as you tooke her foorth of it. Thus haue you briefely heard the ſum of this aduenture, after which, may it pleaſe you to goe take your reſt, becauſe you muſt returne to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the Emperour <hi>Primaleon.</hi>

In the morning, euery man armed him ſelfe to depart thence, and the Knight of the Iland (knéeling before <hi>Florendos</hi>) would be inſtituted by him (who was ſonne to the Emperour) a Deputie gouernour of the Iland, which was performed on both ſides with great loue and kindnes.</p>

                  <hi>Primaleon,</hi> dreaming ſtill on the wizzard <hi>Aliartes</hi> deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, to ſerue him ſelfe with his ayde in enfranchizing <hi>Victoria,</hi> eſpecially in ſuch occaſions appertayning to the enchauntment, as his courage and valour would but little ſted him in: after that he had aduertiſed his Father, how he had ſet frée his Mother from an enchauntment, and ſent her by <hi>Trineus</hi> to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> taking his gentle farewell of them all, he parted thence, and arriuing where <hi>Dorina</hi> expected him, he entreated her to leaue him a while to him ſelfe, and meete him at the <hi>Perillous Ile,</hi> if he ſhould ſtand in neede of her helpe concerning the enchauntment.</p>
               <p>The reaſon why he would not now haue her companie, was becauſe he hoped to méete with <hi>Arguto</hi> againe, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile him from his péeuiſh obſtinacie, but he found a quite contrary hinderance in his way: for <hi>Palmerin</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> whom Fortune had conducted to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> entred there vnknowne to any but his Lady <hi>Polinarda,</hi> and ſhée percea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his cloſe intent, was as ſecret to him as his part deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. There heard he of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Knights impriſonment, alſo the miſhappe and diſgrace befalne the wiſe <hi>Aliarte,</hi> his brother, and hauing ſtayed eight dayes thus ſecretly with his wife: he determined firſt to deliuer his brother, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward goe to the Ile of <hi>Carderia,</hi> holding it for moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and aſſured, that all theſe things happened but by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chauntment, wherein his brother <hi>Aliarte</hi> would highly ſted him: ſo, cauſing his Horſe and Armes to be cloſely caried out of the Citty gates, he proceeded according to his reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued purpoſe.</p>

               <p>Theſe wordes incenſed <hi>Palmerin</hi> beyond all meanes of ſufferance, and becauſe (for very anger) hee could returne him no aunſwere, he gaue preſent way to his Horſe for the Iouſt. <hi>Primaleon</hi> repented, that he had ſo furiouſly prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him, as well in regarde of his great valour, which he had neuer approoued, as alſo becauſe he was his Vnckle, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward whom (indéede) hee ought to haue béene ſomewhat more dutifull: but being vnable now to ſhunne the tryall, without blame and diſgrace, committing him ſelfe to his euer-fauouring Miſtreſſe, he gaue the ſpurres to his Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer to méete him valiantly.</p>
               <p>In the encounter, the earth trembled as if it had opened, and the Horſes met with ſuch violence together, that they both were ſet on their buttockes on the ground, and riſing againe by the quickning of the ſpurre, the Knights Laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces beeing ſhiuerd in péeces to their hands, they were both mightily aſtonned, <hi>Palmerin</hi> réeling twiſe, as if he would haue falne beſide his Horſe, and <hi>Primaleon</hi> ſo ſhaken, as if his ſences were quite bereft him.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Palmerin</hi> conceiting inwardly with him ſelfe, what hee might be that ſet him thus hardly, could not thinke it to be <hi>Don Florian</hi> his brother, nor yet <hi>Florendos,</hi> becauſe he ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried no ſuch corpulence of body: where-vpon, he grew into ſuch fury, that croſſing his ſworde arme ouer <hi>Primaleons</hi> back, &amp; thwarting the other directly before him, he thought ſo to get him forth of the ſaddle.

               <p>Thus ſo many Knights ſtrayed after aduentures, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countring with diuers Ladies and Knights, that endured wrongs in many ſeuerall kindes, and were by their prow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſe right happily deliuered. But as the thrée Giants rode

thorow a Forreſt, they held an earneſt diſcourſe to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, about a noyſe of hammers which they heard, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured (by ſeparating themſelues) to finde out the reaſon thereof: but all their endeuour was to no purpoſe, becauſe this aduenture appertained to neither of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Franardo</hi> not knowing whether he went, turned direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly backe the ſame way he came, and meeting with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the ſudden ioy in either at their encounter, ſmothered ſpéech a while in dumbe embraces: and riding to meet their other companions, to take the courſe before concluded on, they chaunced to heare the voyce of <hi>Almaroll,</hi> and ſo in ſhort while met altogether. But ſpeake we now of <hi>Florendos</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, who méeting by the way with no notable aduenture, arriued in a morning with his ſonne <hi>Oliuanto</hi> at <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> where the Emperour, <hi>Don Edward,</hi> and diuers Knights being in company, welcomd them with no meane ioy and feaſting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Florendos,</hi> perceiuing the Emperour his Father, and <hi>Don Edward</hi> of <hi>England</hi> to be both in ſound eſtate, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding glad, in regard of the loue he bare to them, &amp; good hope he had of his owne recouery.</p>
               <p>Paſſing on along the Pallace, his Mother <hi>Grydonia</hi> the Empreſſe, <hi>Miragarda</hi> his wife, and fayre <hi>Polynarda</hi> his ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, came all and embraced him, each contending who ſhoulde expreſſe moſt affection in theyr kinde embraces. Theſe curteſies being growne to a milder kindnes, <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos</hi> entreated the Empreſſe his Mother, that ſhee would vouchſafe to annoint the place, where the nerues of his leg were contracted numly together: which was no ſooner ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with the oyntment, but his legge became as nimble as euer, each one reioycing at ſo pleaſing an accident.</p>
               <p>After that <hi>Oliuanto</hi> had taſted the kindnes of his grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother, and the other Quéenes, hee went and fell on his knee before <hi>Auriana,</hi> who nothing aſhamed of the honeſt loue ſhe bare him, made the leſſe outward ſpare of her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward affection. When he had tolde her his mighty labour at the enchaunted Pallace, ſhe fetched a déepe inward ſigh,
<pb facs="tcp:14347:206"/>
as knowing that ſuch an enchauntment was neuer begun, (the King beeing a Magitian of ſo great experience, and able ſtill to renew it at his owne pleaſure) but that hee pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ſeuere reuenge vpon <hi>Oliuanto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nowe come we to <hi>Arguto,</hi> who was ready to die with very enuie, becauſe ſo many famous occaſions fell to <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maleon,</hi> and ſtil were concluded by his princely valour, hée happened into the Woode, ſo ſoone as the thrée (before na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Giants) were departed thence on theyr iourney, and hearing what a noyſe the hammers made, drew directly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the place: but euer as he attained neerer and néerer, ſo much the louder and more violent he heard the noiſe, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the very earth to tremble vnder him, yet his bold cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage could not be diſmaied, but ſtill guided him onward, til hee came where hee might beholde a goodly Sepulcher or Tombe, which appeared by the principall image or figure made in the midſt thereof, to be prepared for ſome King, there to enioy his royall enterment.</p>
               <p>Now by reaſon the hammers noiſe exceeded in violence, his horſe (by no meanes) would endure it, whereby he was conſtrained to allight, and going néerer, found the place hemd in with a wall thrée pearches high, but not any doore to be diſcerned: as he ſtoode muſing heereon a while to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, vppon a ſuddaine a great gate opened in the Wall, whence iſſued foorth a Knight, armed from heade to foote in blacke Armour, with a ſhort Arming ſword in his hande, who ſpake to <hi>Arguto</hi> in this manner. Proud Knight, hard is thy hap in ſeeking this Sepulcher, which was made for <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, though hée dying ſoone after in <hi>Perſia,</hi> could not héere receiue his buriall. Neuertheleſſe, the wiſe Magitian that builded this place, was willing that no eye ſhould beholde it, as aſhamed of his owne mightie errour, that hee ſhould be croſt in the buriall of <hi>Alexander</hi>: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſée no other remedy, but thou muſt needes venture the combate with mee, and if it be thy happe to ouercome mee, thou wilt afterward wiſh that thy ſelfe had been van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:14347:206"/>Theſe words daunted not the hart of <hi>Arguto,</hi> where va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and arrogancie ſhooke friendly handes together, but drawing forth his ſword, aſſailed the Knight, to get within the gate, leaſt it ſhould be ſhutte againſt him when hee had conquered his enemie, and many blowes he deliuered, but the other Knight was ſo quick and expeditious, as he could not faſten one ſtroke vppon him: neuertheleſſe, ſo manie thruſts were returned vppon him, as if hee had not broken them readily with his Shield of the Sun, the leaſt of them had béene of force to haue paſt quite thorow him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arguto</hi> could not deuiſe what to thinke of the Knights agilitie, which made all his labour ſort to no effect when he ſmote at him, nor did he deliuer any downe-right or ſiding blowes, but onely foynes and thruſts, which ſtill hée drew backe againe ſo farre as hee could, by reaſon they ſtoode ſo cloſe to each other, which prooued but little aduantageable to the ſtrange Knight, for now when he ſaw he could make no more thruſts, he was glad to ſmite any way as beſt hée might: whereof <hi>Arguto</hi> made no reckoning at all, becauſe his aduerſaries foynes had not hurt him, and theſe other ſtrokes fell ſo lightly on him, as if they had béen the blowes of a child, whereupon, letting fall his weapon, hee caught <hi>Arguto</hi> faſt about the middle, and drew him into the gate, where the Knight vaniſhing, left him ſhutte vp within the wall, and nowe no gate nor ſigne thereof, was any more to be ſéene.</p>
               <p>This rayſed ſome ſuſpition in <hi>Arguto,</hi> that there he was encloſed to be famiſhed to death, and walking about to ſee what might betide him, hee beheld a great yron doore to lift it ſelfe vp, which couered a déepe hollowe vaulte that went vnder the Tombe, and he looking into it, ſawe that it was full of rauenous Serpents, lifting vp theyr heads, as if they would preſently haue deuoured the Knight: hee not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this caſe what was beſt to be done, a Lady appeared to him, looking foorth at a little window in the Sepulchers ſide, and thus ſhe ſpake. Sir Knight, héere art thou like to die with famine, except thou caſt thy ſelfe into this hollow
<pb facs="tcp:14347:207"/>
vault, where (except heauen be the more propitious to thée) thou art aſſured likewiſe to be eaten vp of Serpents.</p>
               <p>Theſe two extreame choiſes ſéemed ſomewhat difficult, a preſent diſpatch by gréedy Serpents, or a lingering death by hunger-ſtarued famiſhment, nor blame him, to conſider a while on ſo hard an election: to yeeld to famine, beſide the ſhame and infamie of the death, it would bereaue him of chriſtian and charitable patience, which is a mans chiefeſt glory in ſo fierce an agony: to caſt him ſelfe downe among the Serpents, therein appeared a manly reſolution, and the diſpatch of life would be immediate, but how reported of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, there the queſtion remained.</p>
               <p>Hauing thus conſulted with his ſilent thoughts, which were guilty rather of too much forwardnes, then any baſe feare or ſléepy cowardiſe, the ſelfe ſame courage ſeazed on his ſpirits, which neuer left his Graundfather <hi>Fryſoll,</hi> and without any dread of the very greateſt danger, he caſt him ſelfe at one leape into the Caue: No ſooner had hee thus done, but he found him ſelfe ſo writhd about with the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, as he could ſtirre no part of him but his hands only, wherefore in ſuch a ſtrict diſtreſſe, he truſted onely to God and his manuall ſtrength, catching the Serpents faſt by the neckes, and wroong them about with ſuch facility and eaſe, as he had kild aboue an hundred of them very quickly, which could not but be great comfort to him, ſéeing his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour thriue ſo ſucceſſefully, and him ſelfe not ſo much mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted as at his firſt entraunce: notwithſtanding, there was one Serpent excéeding y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſt in greatnes, that had a crowne vpon his head, and he held the Knight to ſo buſie a taſke, as by no meanes he could get from him, yet did he often catch hand faſt on the Serpents necke, but all his ſtrength was not able enough to hold him.</p>
               <p>While this buſie conflict thus continued, the Knight which before had vaniſhed from his ſight, appeared now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine aboue at the mouth of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Caue, hauing a goodly Launce in his hand, and there-with he gaue ſo many thruſts at our Champion, as he would not affoord him the very leaſt brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:14347:207"/>
while. Nowe began <hi>Arguto</hi> to deſpaire of his life, thinking no meanes were left for him to eſcape, for ſtill as he turned to reſiſt the Serpent, that he ſhould not writhe his taile about his legges to ouerthrow him: the Knight aboue moleſted him mightily with the Launce, putting him often times to very hard extremities. The great Serpent hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out ſtil fiercely againſt him, at laſt caught the Knights head (helmet and all) in his mouth, ſo that <hi>Arguto</hi> was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to fall: and had he not ſtifly graſpt the Serpents necke, whoſe filthy breath &amp; ſauour well-neere choakt him, he had preſently falne down dead, but this gripe made the Serpent let goe his hold, &amp; flying off from him to recouer breathing, the Knight aboue then layd at him with the Launce, ſo that he could ſtir no way without intricate trouble. At laſt, he thought it his beſt courſe to cloſe with the Serpent, and try if by méere ſtrength he could ouercome him, but ſoone did he repent ſo fond an opinion: for the Serpent ſuddainly ſpread out his wings, and wroong him ſo painfully betwéene their gripe, that he neuer felt the like agonie before.</p>
               <p>Neuertheleſſe, <hi>Arguto</hi> well remembring with himſelfe, that his life &amp; honour ſtood now on the very laſt caſt, caught once more the Serpents neck betwéen his hands, &amp; griping it with like ſtrength as he had done before, he quickly got looſe forth of his wings, which prooued no great aduantage to him, for the Knight with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Launce as cruelly vexed him, and made him endure a miſerable torment, wherof to be rid one way or another, &amp; either end his life or the aduenture, he got faſt hold of the Launce, which he puld vnto him with ſo maine violence, as (being wholy poſſeſſed of it) the Knight was gone againe, &amp; not to be ſéene. When he ſaw y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Launce thus in his owne cuſtody, by which he had ſuffered ſo much paine &amp; trauaile, his mind halfe perſwaded him, that in it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained ſome ſecret vertue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherby y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enchauntment might be brought to concluſion, &amp; beginning to ſmite the Serpents with the Launce which nowe came about him more furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly then before, ſo many of them as the Launce lighted vppon, preſently turned about and fell downe dead.
<pb facs="tcp:14347:208"/>
But the great crowned Serpent, making no account at all of his ſtrokes, put him to more perillous trouble then all the reſt did, therefore he was glad to wayte opportunities, and by many leapes and turnes to keepe ſtill aloofe, defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him ſelfe ſo well as hee coulde with the Launce, the length whereof was diuers times diſcommodious to him. At laſt, watching aduantage that might prooue to ſome pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, euen when him ſelfe leaſt expected ſuch good luck, the Serpent (waxing weary of the blowes he receaued by the enchaunted Launce) giuing back a pretty diſtance from the Knight, made proffer of a ſuddaine leape vpon him, to catch his head once more in his mouth, &amp; ſhooting forth his necke, lay gaping to expreſſe what he intended.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arguto</hi> (loath to looſe time ſo apparantly offered) thruſt his Launce into the Serpents throate, and driuing it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to his hart, tumbled him ouer and ouer ſtarke dead, which good occaſion (had it not thus happened,) hee might ſooner there haue loſt his owne life, then gained the victory againſt the Serpent.</p>
               <p>Being now ſore laboured and very weary, he ſate down and reſted him ſelfe vpon the dead Serpents, and not drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of any further danger to enſue, ſuddainly a Serpent gript him by the belly, and dragging him along downe a paire of ſtaires, his head hung ſtill vpward, receauing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie knockes and thumps all the way hee was thus caried. When he was come to the hethermoſt ſtep of all, he would haue riſen vp, but he could not deuiſe how, when preſently there came a ſauage man, with a ſtrange faſhioned ſword, ready drawne in his hand, and ſmiting a mighty blowe a thwart the Serpent, ſeuerd it in ſunder iuſt in the midſt: but <hi>Arguto</hi> was almoſt dead with his dragging downe the ſtaires, and doubtleſſe had periſhed, but that his good Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour did very much ſted him, but being deliuered from ſo painfull a griping, he ſtarted vp on his féete, preparing his ſworde to encounter with the ſauage man, who vſing no words at all, but making ſignes to haue him ſtand on his beſt guard, they buckled cloſe together, <hi>Arguto</hi> wounding
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:14347:208"/>
the ſauage man in many parts of his body, becauſe he had no ſkill in defending him ſelfe, nor diuers times could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie kéepe vp on his féete, which made <hi>Arguto</hi> the more hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of victory, and ſtepping vpon him at an aduantage, offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to haue ſlaine him: but that the firſt Knight came again crying to him, that he ſhould hold his hand and not kill him, becauſe of his blood would ariſe vp more Serpents, then all thoſe he had ſlaine before in the vault.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arguto</hi> preſently drew back his ſword, &amp; deuiſing how he might otherwiſe ouercome him, ſaw fixed in the marble wall of the Caue, a great Ring of yron, with a long chaine hanging downe and faſtened thereto, which he immediatly imagined, was purpoſely kept there to binde this furie. With much a-doe he haled him to it, where at length hee bound him very ſtrongly, &amp; finding no other encombrance to hinder him, he came forth of the Caue, on the other ſide of the Sepulcher, which he perceaued to be fairer and richer then that he had firſt ſéene.</p>
               <p>Héere began he now to glut his gréedy eye, with ſight of the ſeuerall ſtatues in order, which declared the admirable deedes of <hi>Alexander</hi>: firſt, how he fought with <hi>Darius</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and ouercame him: next, his battaile with King <hi>Porus</hi> of <hi>India:</hi> as alſo his artificiall paſſage of the Riuer <hi>Indus.</hi> And as hee ſtoode noting a very dangerous hazard, which happened to him at a Caſtell where he fought: hee heard him ſelfe called by his name, and turning to ſee who was ſo familiar with him, hee eſpied cloſe by him two ſtrange Monſters, hauing the heads and breaſts of a Viper, and all their other parts like to a Lyon, except the clawes, which rather ſéemed like the tallants of a Griffen. Theſe two catching faſt holde with their téeth on his arme, gript him ſo ſtrictly, as for a good while he could hardly ſtir him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: but when they ſaw that he ſhrunk no more, neither fell downe (as they expected) they let goe their hold, and he recouering quickly the Launce, accounting it his beſt wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon to fight with againſt them, layde at each of them with ſuch ſkill &amp; readines, as if he had not that day béene wearied
<pb facs="tcp:14347:209"/>
at all. In ſhort time he had ſo wounded both the Monſters, that they (as their lateſt refuge and helpe) got on each ſide ſo néere him, that riſing together on their hinder féete, they faſtened their former fangs about him, and their tallants ſo pierced through the cloſing of his Armour, as thereby he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued ſixe little hurts, and loſt the benefit of his Launce, wherefore a while he muſt make vſe of his hands, catching either of them ſo ſtrongly by the legges, and bending them violently (as if he meant to breake them) made them at laſt to giue him liberty, when perceauing he could not regaine his Launce, he drew forth his ſword, where-with defending him ſelfe, more then offending the Monſters, he trauerſed about a while, as ayming at the likelieſt means for victory. Suddainly he apprehended this reſolution, eyther to make a ſpéedy diſpatch of his life, or by one way or another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude his enterpriſe, where-vpon, he fell downe flat on his back, with his ſword in the one hand, and his dagger in the other, that the Monſters might imagine him to be fully vanquiſhed. Which ſorting to his expectation, &amp; they ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping ouer him to teare him with their tallants, he found his hope almoſt quite fruſtrated, for ſtabbing at their bellies, which he ſuppoſed to be tender, he found that their ſkinnes were of exceeding ſound proofe, till chauncing at laſt vpon the nauell, he made ſuch a large inciſion with his ſword, as the bowels of one of them dropt out on the ground, and the other ſled away he could not tell whether.</p>
               <p>So ſoone as the Monſter was thus fied and gone, all the ſeuerall Statues began to mooue and ſtir, eſpecially that of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, framing ſuch actions and comely ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, cach after his Countrie quality and faſhion, as if they expreſſed ſignes of thankfulnes to him, which (deſpight the Magitians vtmoſt malice) they ſtill continued, to his no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>Heereby <hi>Arguto</hi> vnderſtood, that the aduenture was now fully concluded, whereof his thoughts growing greatlie proud, he thus reſolued, that this his conqueſt was of as much fame and glory, as <hi>Primaleons</hi> was at the Ile of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deria:</hi>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:14347:209"/>
then turning him about, the Knight that was the Magitian, and could not die while the enchauntment endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, appeared before him very ſadly, &amp; in regard of the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate death he now expected, he ſpake vnto him in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Sir Knight, well mayſt thou vaunt of the worthieſt enterpriſe, that any Knight errant durſt euer vndertake, yet nowe by thée right nobly accompliſhed: for I am the man that made this Sepulcher, hoping to haue had y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole world wonder at it, but errour beguild me, and baffuld the height of my chiefeſt hopes, for <hi>Alexander</hi> dying ſo farre hence, and his abſolute rule deuided into foure faire Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies, I forthwith framed this enchauntment, to the end no mortall eye might euer behold it. But thou art come, and haſt diſappointed my determination, which, as it cuts the threed of my life, ſo ſhall it inflict this puniſhment vpon thée, that thou ſhalt neuer haue her whom thy heart longs moſt after. And this (beſide) I tell thée that all my deſſignment is not fruſtrated by thée, for in this Tombe ſhall be buried the only vertuous and renowmed Emperour, that euer the future ages ſhall affoord: hauing thus ſpoken, he died, and immediatly the noiſe of Hammers ceaſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arguto</hi> was diſpleaſed at this ſad prognoſtication con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his Loue, but ſuch was his preſent ioy for his victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, as hee ſuffered other thoughts the eaſier to paſſe his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance: and ſearching further about the Sepulcher, at laſt he eſpied two huge Giants of yron, with each a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Hammer in his hand, whereby he gathered, that their knocking had maintained the enchauntment. So finding nothing elſe there to doo for him, he prepared to part thence, when preſently he beheld his Squire to enter bringing him ſuch prouiſion as he could get, becauſe he thought his Lord had neede of refreſhing: when the Squire had bound vp his wounds receaued in the fight, they ſate downe to eate, and afterward betooke them ſelues to reſt, where a while wee muſt leaue them, returning nowe to <hi>Palmerin</hi> and <hi>Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon.</hi>

               <p>The Knight heereat grew greatly diſpleaſed, yet reputed it no leſſe then baſeſt villanie, to draw his ſword on an aged man, and flight (on the contrary) was as ſhameful: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore taking vp a little club that lay by him, and there-with bearing backe his beard when he offerd it toward him, the old man at length was ſo mad angry, that leaping vppon <hi>Primaleons</hi> backe, he wound his long beard about his neck, and ſet ſuch a flame about his head, that the olde man ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from him for ſafetie of himſelfe, left the Knight in ſuch a wonderfull perrill, as <hi>Aliarte</hi> himſelfe was fearefull of his death. But the flame being extinct, and <hi>Primaleon</hi> wel perceiuing that all the olde mans power conſiſted in his beard, he drew his ſword, and there-with cut it cloſe by his chinne, where-upon the olde man fell downe bereft of his ſences, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fire (which in this bickering had caught hold on his Armour) immediatly vaniſhed.</p>
               <p>Beeing thus at libertie from any impeachment, he caſt out another corded hooke, which likewiſe linckt faſt about abarre of the Cage, ſo that now by helpe of both the ropes, hee could drawe himſelfe the néerer to it: but as hee buſily thus beſtowed his time, the great Fiſh, which at firſt made proffer of ouer-turning the boate, leapt now into it, lading it with ſuch an incredible poyſe, that euery minute it ſtoode vpon the ſincking. The Fiſh opening a wide huge mouth, ſwallowed vp the old man aliue &amp; luſtie, which ſome-what terrifying the thoughts of <hi>Primaleon,</hi> (ſéeing himſelfe in ſo helpleſſe a place, where hee knew not how to imploy his

Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe, by the Knights mighty ſtirring and ſtriking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, at laſt he grapled holde on the olde mans chinne againe, which lay againſt the very tendreſt part of the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes belly, and there the Knight ſo labourd with his dagger, that at laſt he made a large wide paſſage, out at which hee ſlipt very eaſily, and after him came foorth a Beaſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what bigger then a dogge, but of ſuch a ſtrange deformed ſhape, as he could not imagine of what kinde he was: this beaſt caught the great Fiſh by one of his finnes, and caſt him out of the Boate into the water, but ſuch was the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the Boate in the Fiſhes turning ouer, that the Boate was ready to ſinke flat downe.</p>
               <p>This feare beeing ouer-blowne, and the Boate in bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter eſtate of ſtayedneſſe, the beaſt began proudly to walke vp and downe, and <hi>Primaleon</hi> ſtill expecting when he ſhould be aſſayled, was not vnready in the like to the beaſt, and blowes he felt to light vppon him ſelfe, but euer when hee returned requitall, he ſawe the beaſt to leape euery where about him, but no ſtroke of his to faſten vppon him: ſo that <hi>Primaleon</hi> (very much wearied with labouring thus in vaine) the more willingly deſired to ſitte downe and reſt him, but then the beaſt leapt very ſwiftly about him, and the beaſt hauing the pawes of a Lyon, as alſo the tuſhes of a wilde Boare, had rent off ſome part of his Armour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, and with his téeth hurt him vppon the right thigh. The ſtrife thus continued betwéene them for two houres ſpace, with no meane vexation and trouble to <hi>Primaleon,</hi>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:14347:212"/>
who perceauing the beaſt to offende him ſo harmfully with his teeth and pawes: concluded vpon a quick ſpeedy diſpatch of life, or elſe to break through the Ice of the dangerous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe. Which he could not accompliſh while he kept vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his féet, wherefore he fell flat on his back all a-long, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting when the beaſt ſhould offer to make his ſeazure to kill him. As he thus lay awayting his aduantage, with no ſilly care to auoyde the beaſts dangerous proffers, he gaue a foorth-right thruſt with his ſword, which happening full in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the beaſts mouth, cutte quite in ſunder his longeſt teeth, and many of the other beſide, ſo that they falling out of his mouth on the ground, and the beaſt thus deſpoyled of his chiefeſt Armour, with his feet kept a treading on the throat of <hi>Primaleon,</hi> wounding him in diuers places very daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly. But becauſe hee ſcorned to be ſlaine in ſo ſeruile a manner (his hopes thereby ayming at much better ſucceſſe) he recouered footing againe, making many gallant aſſaults for diſpatch of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beaſt, who being defeated of his teeth, could not annoy him ſo much as he did before: for nowe his beſt fight conſiſted in his formoſt feete, which the beaſt lifting vp both together, to ſeaze on the Knight withall, with a glen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſtroke he ſmote them off both together, which making the body to réele about confuſedly, at laſt it tumbled into the water.

So long his thoughts were thus imployed, till (had not <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarte</hi> cryed out the ſooner to him, to beware of a Monſter of the Sea, which ſoftly had ſtolne vp into the boate) he had beene pluckt backward into the water: but turning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vpon this warning, he beheld the ſtrangeſt forme and ſhape, that euer any man had ſeene before: nor was this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny faigned Monſter, but a meere abortiue of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sea, which <hi>Druſa Velonna</hi> (by her arte) had brought out of the wideſt Seas, to prohibite the freedome of <hi>Aliarte</hi> by any man.</p>

               <p>Hée not knowing in this extremitie what was beſt to be done, perceiued the long beard which he cut from the olde man, to grow vppon the chinne of the Monſter, wheron he tooke faſt hold, and dragd him about the boate after him in ſuch manner, that ſeeing he vſed no furder contention, hee caſt off the Monſter to his owne libertie: whereuppon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would come no more in ſo ſtrict handling, hee lay ſtill a while very ſeruilely, but ſtarted vp afterward verie quicke and ſprightly, and leaping about him, to catch him within the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſe of his beard, the Knight as nimbly kept aloofe off from him, ſo that all the Monſters ſlights prooued but in vaine.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe this conflict ſhewed not as yet, on which ſide the victory was likelieſt to fall, a crimo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And let me tell ye withall, that our Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions lauiſh expence of his blood, abated his courage and very much weakened him, ſo that while the Monſter drew backe to breathe, he (as gladly) leaned on his ſword to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy a little reſt.</p>
               <p>As thus he ſtoode, a ſudden flawe of the Sea ſmote the boate againſt the rocke, and made the ſterne end to ſplit a little, which ruſh of the boate caſting <hi>Primaleon</hi> backward, the Monſter caught him by the feete, dragging him along ſo rudely and ſpéedily, that hauing gotten him halfe out of the boate, the Monſter leapt into the water, ſtill holding him faſt by the feete, but the weight of his body ſo counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Where vpon, aduauncing him ſelfe née<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to the Barque, he ſtept into it, when preſently it laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched off from the ſhoare, with an eaſie gentle gale of winde, and ſo ſtruck vp into the maine Sea.</p>
               <p>Then ſuddainely happened a violent tempeſt, which made him euery minute in daunger of periſhing: but his minde deſpiſing all perill whatſoeuer, cheared his hope in the very ſharpeſt agony, and the Barque ioyned at length cloſe to a vaſt mountaine. Where ſtepping forth armed as he was, he went on foote vp ſuch an high aſcending hill, that ſlipping oftentimes vpon the ſmooth ſtones, hee ſlid downe often backward, &amp; made very ſlender riddance of his way. This kind of labour laſted him all that day, with much vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, &amp; but to little purpoſe, as ſéeming that he ſhould neuer attaine the height of the hill: ſo, night ouer-taking him, he made a better ſupper of ſad conceites, then any other viands which could content him: his mind ſtill ayming at nothing elſe, but how he might ſooneſt finde the faire Lady, and then (if ſhe likewiſe diſdained to loue him) to practiſe ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent diſpatch of his life, but with a memorable teſtimonie, that he died for loue. The morning ſhaking off his dumpiſh cogitations, he coaſted along the ſide of the mountaine, and came at laſt to a pretty large Plaine, which round was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>girt with big riſing hils, &amp; in the midſt thereof ſtoode a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull goodly Pallace. Now albeit he had neuer ſéene this place before, yet he called to remembrance, ſome former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Princeſſe <hi>Leonarda,</hi> &amp; that (in all reſpects like this) ſuch another was the Pallace belonging to Quéene <hi>Melia:</hi> heereupon, his hart began to leape with conceite of ioy, &amp; he held it as a matter moſt certaine, that here the Lady <hi>Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> was enchaunted.</p>
               <p>As he directed his courſe on toward y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pallace, he beheld a Knight, with two goodly blood-hounds walking by him,
<pb facs="tcp:14347:217"/>
come (as it were) with intent to méete him, and ſuddainly the Hounds began to runne toward him, where doubtleſſe (being hunger-ſtarued &amp; gréedy) they had torne him in pée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: but that the Knight, (who indéede was <hi>Druſa Velonna</hi> thus tranſ-formed, to guide <hi>Floraman</hi> into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pallace with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any combate,) reclaimed them back, and then ſtepping to him, he vſed theſe or the very like ſpéeches. Sir Knight, I ſée that you are a ſtraunger in theſe parts, wherefore, if loue haue béen your conducter hether, eſpecially to the Lady encloſed in this Pallace: you may account it as no meane fortune, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is your good hap to méete with me, who bids you boldly to reſt aſſured, that here is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> choiſeſt beauty enchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which euer mortall eye as yet hath lookt vpon, therfore, if it pleaſe you to goe along with me, your owne eyes ſhall be apparant witneſſes, that the world containes not a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable beauty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Floraman</hi> being fully confirmed in opinion, that it was the faire Lady <hi>Victoria,</hi> without any further protracting of time, followed the guidance of the Knight, &amp; he was no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner entred the Pallace, but hauing a ſight of <hi>Victoriaes</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he became (by power of the enchauntment) ſo iealous of her, as he would néeds vndertake y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iouſt, againſt any that durſt preſume to come thether. But quickly was ſhe rapt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine from his ſight, which enflamed his deſire with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vehemencie, &amp; bound him moſt officiouſly to her ſeruice.

Being then thus ſummoned to the ſearch of <hi>Victoria,</hi> and he loath to looſe any time in vaine, directed his courſe as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you haue heard, and riding through a queachie thicke Wood, an angry wilde Beare came mainely againſt him, as meaning to ſtaunch his hunger vpon him: but he hauing his Launce ſtill ready charged, defended him ſelfe with ſuch ſkill and manhoode, as the Beare (not daring to endure his blowes) began to runne from him a ſoftly pace, euen as if (through méere wearineſſe) hee coulde ſpéede no faſter. <hi>Arguto</hi> purſued the track of the Beare, till it brought him directly to the Sea ſide, where the beaſt ſtill holding his courſe a-long, met by chaunce with a Damoſell vppon the way, whom hee catching vp betwéene his pawes, ranne with her into a little Pynace, which lay at Ankor there hard by the riuage.</p>
               <p>No ſooner had the Beare caried his pray a boord, but the Pynace launched (of it ſelfe) into the water, <hi>Arguto</hi> riding his Horſe ſtill after, where ſuddainly he eſpied the Beare on the hindeck of the Pynace, and the Damoſell ſitting downe cloſe by him, without any touch or offer of violence. This gaue the Knight a preſent apprehenſion, that héerein
<pb facs="tcp:14347:218"/>
conſiſted ſome ſtrange aduenture, wherefore, riding néerer to the Pynace ſide, he gaue his Horſe the ſpurre, and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into it: the veſſell putting off immediatly from the ſhoare, before the Squire could gaine his entrance, and ſo it rode out into the maine déepe, hauing neither the helpe of Oares or ſailes.</p>
               <p>Hauing (by his owne eſtimation) gone aboue a thouſand miles, at length the Pinace drew néere to a ſtéepy moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, whoſe diſcent fell downe into the Sea, affording no eaſie place for landing: which he not regarding, at all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture mounted forth on ſhoare, &amp; the Pinace ſtrooke back againe into the Sea. Being thus alone there by him ſelfe, he happened vpon a narrow path, which guided him along the ſide of the mountain, where riding on with what haſt he beſt could, he came at laſt to the quadrant plaine, where he ſoone had a ſight of the fore-mentioned Pallace: there met he alſo the Knight, &amp; his two rauenous blood-hounds, one of them flying ſo fiercely vpon him, that he caught his Horſe by the noſthrill, and made him fling about very diſtempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratly, which <hi>Arguto</hi> perceauing, &amp; loath to be ouerthrowne by his Horſe, leapt out of the ſaddle, oppoſing him ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Hounds &amp; the Knight, who hauing a kéene edged Axe in his hand, deliuered thrée or foure ſuch rude ſtrokes there-with, as <hi>Arguto</hi> réeld about twiſe or thriſe, &amp; (at laſt) was glad to leane himſelf againſt a trée. The blood-hounds ſtill made violently at him, &amp; faſtning holde vpon one of his legs, dragd him along as purpoſing to kill him: but his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage contemning all dangers whatſoeuer, &amp; ſcorning to die in ſo vile a maner, being got vpon his féet, he drew forth his ſword, &amp; aiming a maine ſtroke at the Hounds, they flew off from him, &amp; then the Knight ſet to him with his Axe, which in ſhort while after ſlipt out of his hand, &amp; <hi>Arguto</hi> doubling ſtroke vpon ſtroke, had brought y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Knight into weak eſtate, but that the blood-hounds leapt vpon his backe, and (by ill hap) rent in ſunder the laces of his helmet, which falling off his head to the ground, and he (ſtill fiercely ſet vpon by them) began to imagine his caſe ſomewhat deſperate.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:14347:218"/>Now, albeit he would more gladly haue parted with his life, then vſe any baſe meanes for ſafetie thereof: yet ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his head in this ſort diſarmed, it coulde not but make him the more warie of himſelfe: wherefore, auoyding the blood-houndes ſo well as he could, and the Knights aſſaults which grew troubleſome to him, hee found that he had no loytering worke in hand. For ſuch was the agilitie both of the houndes and the Knight, as they got aduantage ſtill on him, but he could not faſten a blow vppon them: yet grew they (at length) to retire from his ſtrokes, and hee (ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a dangerous proffer of the Axe) followed the houndes as they tooke toward the Pallace, intending to accompliſh ſome noble act, or elſe to die in the height of his preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>And as the Knight came vppon him with the Axe, with a full intent to haue cleft his head, the hounds caught holde on the lappets of his Armour, and hald him forward ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſedly, as at laſt he was drawne within y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pallace, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Knight beeing very ioyfull, that he had him within compaſſe of the enchauntment, hee came to <hi>Arguto</hi> with theſe ſpeeches. Be not offended Sir Knight, that thou art thus brought into this Pallace: for héere thou ſhalt ſée the richeſt beauty of the world, and it may be thy good happe to be poſſeſſor thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arguto</hi> perſwading himſelfe, that he meant the beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>Victoria,</hi> tooke this as a happy welcome to him, and anſwered. To me (Sir) can come no greater good fortune, then ſo rare a beautie as you haue ſpoken of: which I am the more deſirous to behold, to know whether it be ſhée or no, that is the onely cauſe of my trauaile. Euen ſhee it is, (replied the Knight) and for your better aſſurance héerein, goe along with me, and you ſhall ſée her. So walking on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward into a Chamber, hee there beheld the faire <hi>Victoria,</hi> and as he offered amourous parlance and ſeruice to her, ſhe vaniſhed from him, leauing him ſo full of paſſionate tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentings, that now hee wiſht himſelfe hand to hand with <hi>Primaleon,</hi> to try which of them could beſt deſerue her.</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:14347:219"/>In that very inſtant came <hi>Floraman</hi> to him, who (by meanes of the enchauntment) had no knowledge of him, neither <hi>Arguto</hi> had any of him: and thus wrought <hi>Velon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> becauſe they ſhould not combate together, by reaſon the nature of the enchauntment was ſuch, that ſo ſoone as any mans blood was ſpilt in the Pallace, immediatly the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chauntment ceaſſed.

But hee ſcorning to ſerue for foode to two ſuch rauenous Beaſts, layde at them chesrefully with his ſword, albeit the nimblenes of the beaſts was ſuch, as doubtleſſe they had ſlaine him, but that the ſharp ponyar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the furder from him, and be leſſe troubleſome to him then before. The Griffon likewiſe houering aboue him, made many proffers at him with her ſharp tallents, and ſtriuing to gripe him thorow the Armour, wounded her ſelfe in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny parts vpon the ponyards, ſo that ſhe was conſtrained to let him fall, hauing him aloft, as intending to flie thence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with him, and in the fall, <hi>Primaleon</hi> hit his head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the great ſtone, ſo that he lay there ſtil in a traunce, and might right eaſily haue beene depriued of his life, but that the Lyon and the Griffon were both ſore wounded. So ſoone as he was vpon his feete againe, (ſomewhat aſhamed of his fall) he layd about him ſo couragiouſly with his wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, that both the beaſts whoſe hurts grew num and ſtiffe with cold, lagd about very lazilie, and ſtill receiued wound after wound.</p>
               <p>The Griffon, to make her vttermoſt aduantage, moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted once more aloft, and ſoaring about as waiting opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, though ſhe durſt faſten no more hold vppon him, yet ſhe compeld him to waſte time in ſéeking to ſhun her: and often did ſhe beate her wings about his head, till at laſt ſhée ouerthrew him, when ſuddenly the Lyon catching him by the legge, where none of the poynted ponyards were pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, dragd him along vppon the grounde, making him to féele extreame affliction, but freeing himſelfe at laſt by his thicke doubled ſtroakes, and preparing to auoyde a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous proffer of the Griffon, his blow hapned iuſt betweene the cloſing of her wings, cutting one of them quite from the body, whereby ſhe being diſabled from mounting aloft any more, made what haſt ſhee coulde to gette away from the Knight, the like did the Lyon, (hauing laboured ſo long in vaine, and receiued many hurts) kept backe, as willing to come no more neere him.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Primaleon,</hi> going on to the Pallace gate, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no other contradiction to his paſſage, he holdly went in, and becauſe he knew not how he might be encountred, or what dangers might aſſaile him within the Pallace, hee tooke his Axe with him, when preſently the gates clapt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether

Yet (for all this) he ſtil went onward, knocking his heade oftentimes againſt the walls, as if hee deſcended downe into ſome vaulte or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne, till at laſt he ſaw a light a farre off from him, and it ſéemed as if a torch were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming toward him, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what chéering his ſpirits, hee made the more haſt to come neerer to the light. Being come to it, he ſaw that it ſtoode ouer the doore of a Chamber, wherein hee beheld a beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full young Ladie, euery way reſembling his fayre <hi>Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Lady was dragd along deſpightfully by a rude vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciuill villaine, and ſhe (with loude exclaimes) cryed out in this manner: Helpe me (for Gods ſake) any man that can, and let mee not be violenced by this diſcourteous Knight. <hi>Primaleon</hi> perſwading himſelfe, that this was his Ladie, would haue ſtept into the Chamber: but as hee toucht the torch, he ſawe a great fire ſuddenly flaming before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber doore, by the light whereof he beheld the Lady cruellie beaten, becauſe ſhe would not yéeld to the Knights perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>

                  <hi>Primaleon</hi> preparing himſelfe to follow the Adder, ſtood awhile pondering to himſelfe, that this might be but ſome cunning deceit, as indeede it was: for <hi>Druſa Velonna</hi> had aſſumed this ſhape, with intent to guide him to a ſtéepie downe-fall, where ſhee (acquainted well enough with the meanes for her owne ſafety) would no way be endangered, but he (ſuddenly falling downe) ſhould be ſquandred into numberleſſe péeces, according to the nature of the place.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Knight which came foorth of the Serpent, and therefore was called the Knight of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Serpent, walking on his feete along the great Hall, managed the liuing Serpent which hee helde in his hand, with ſuch extraordinary fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitie &amp; nimbleneſſe, as nothing can be imagined more quick and agill. Nowe albeit hee gaue our Champion many cruel ſtrokes therewith, yet this was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, in regarde of the Serpents ſharpe teeth and clawes, which often-times faſtened on the bucklings of his Armor, and made it hang very looſely vpon him, ſo that he ſeeking to ſhunne theſe aſſaults of the Serpent, the Knight flung it faſt about his Helmet, whence writing it ſelfe down along his breaſt, he found his body to be quite diſarmed, and his Helmet to fall beſide his head.</p>
               <p>This perrill did put newe life into all his ſpirits, and lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Axe vp with both his handes, hee gaue a mighty ſtroake ouerthwart the Serpent, whereby it fell downe dead out of the Knights handes: and hee (hauing no other weapon for his owne defence) the doore opening againe in the brazen Serpents ſide, he ran preſently in thereat with no meane haſt, and there ſtoode vpright, as quite bereft of all his ſences.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14347:226"/>
                  <hi>Primaleon</hi> taking vp his Armour &amp; Helmet, went foorth of the Pallace, where <hi>Florian</hi> holpe to arme him againe, earneſtly intreating to returne in with him: but the youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full gallant, to haue the honour alone of ſo great an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, deſired that he would not be ſo much his hinderance, the rather, in regard the aduenture was deſtenied for him onely, and by no man elſe could be concluded. So <hi>Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon</hi> departing from the Prince, came againe to the Hall where he had left the Serpent, and finding there no further reſiſtance, hee went through a doore into another goodlie roome, where ſtoode the armed ſtatues of many Pagane Princes, and huge great cheſtes, wherein the ineſtimable treaſure was contained, whereof we haue briefely ſpoken in the ſecond part of this Hiſtorie, but more at large to be diſcourſed on, both whoſe they were, and for whom reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, either in the end of this booke, or ſome tractate thereon depending.</p>
               <p>Finding there likewiſe no deniall of his paſſage, as hee profferd to enter a little doore directly before him, looking in thereat, he beheld two angry Lyons, each ſtanding rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp on his hinder feete, and placing theyr formoſt on the young Lady <hi>Victorias</hi> ſhoulders: whereupon, ſuch was his feare leaſt the Lady ſhould be endangered, that (neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring his Axe) he ſtept boldly in at the doore, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth his ſword, went to one of the Lyons, which ſtoode ſtill and ſtird not, as if it had béene an Image of ſtone, but onely ſtoode as admiring the Ladies beautie, and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a kinde of feare, leaſt ſhee ſhould by the Knight be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from him, the other Lyon dooing the like in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</p>
               <p>But that which made him moſt of all to meruaile, was the faire <hi>Victoria,</hi> ſtanding as if ſhee were immooueable, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing no word at all, or any ſigne of knowledge of him: this ſight afflicted him more then all the reſt, and made him euen ready to ſinke downe dead with gréefe, till going ſomwhat neerer, and offering his hand to leade her thence, both the Lyons ſuddainly leapt vpon him, and catching him vp be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéen
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:14347:226"/>
their pawes, caried him forth of the chamber, where with their teeth and clawes they cruelly graſpt him, batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and bruſing all his Armour, yet he could not faſten one blow vpon them, but fought as if it had beene with the ayre, till he wexed ſo wearie, that he could very hardly fetch his breath. Notwithſtanding the very vttermoſt of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame agonie, his minde held out couragiouſly, and labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on the likelieſt courſes to be taken, for ſpéedieſt gayning the glory of this enterpriſe, and fréedome of the faire young Lady his Miſtris: in which meditation, he remembred his Axe, which hee ſawe leaning againſt the chamber doore, whereas him ſelfe before had left it, &amp; catching it vp quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, ſmote one of the Lyons there-with vppon the ſhoulder, cleauing him down to the very entrailes, which the Knight reioyced not a little to behold, hoping now of good ſucceſſe in the reſt of his labour. And turning to the other Lyon, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to ſpéed as well with him, becauſe he grew the fiercer vpon him, as hauing (by vertue of the enchauntment) his owne ſtrength redoubled, and the force of his wounded fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes likewiſe infuſed: hee found his hope mightily diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, for the Lyon catching holde with his teeth on the Axe, wroong it out of his hands, ſo that now he was glad to make vſe of his ſword againe, where-with he could defend him ſelfe but very ſlenderly, becauſe all his blowes were ſtill ſpent in vaine.</p>
               <p>Hauing thus fought a long while together, yet all his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour fruitleſſe and to no purpoſe, his owne life alwayes in greateſt hazard, and no likelyhoode of preuailing in the end: hée ſawe the beaſt riſe vp on his hinder legges, when ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly he ranne and caught him in his armes, but thereby he endured the extreameſt paine and turmoile, as in all his life time he neuer felt the like, for the Lyons ſtrength was ſtill doubled againſt him: neuertheleſſe, <hi>Primaleon</hi> helde out ſo currantly, making vſe of cunning ſleights and witty preuentions, that the beaſt got little aduauntage of him. The woorſt that befell <hi>Primaleon</hi> in this dangerous fight, was the beaſts continuall gripes vppon his armes, which
<pb facs="tcp:14347:227"/>
hindered him from getting his dagger foorth, albeit he had made many faire offers at it: but at length, the Lyon wex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing almoſt as wearie as he, and ſtarke mad with rage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee could not ouerthrowe the Knight, letting goe his hold, drew back to watch ſome better aduantage.</p>
               <p>Now had <hi>Primaleon</hi> liberty to recouer his dagger, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with (as the Lyon came fiercely againe vpon him) he ſtabd it into the beaſts right ſhoulder, that it paſt quite thorowe on the other ſide, and there he left the dagger ſtill ſticking. This wound made the beaſt ſo fell &amp; outragious, that graſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping <hi>Primaleon</hi> once more betwéene his pawes, he threw him violently againſt the ground, and went ouer him twiſe or thriſe, as ſéeking the readieſt way to kill him. But as <hi>Primaleon</hi> lay vpon his backe, turning aſide his head to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide the beaſts foote, hee had a ſuddaine ſight of the young Lady <hi>Victoria,</hi> who (in his eye) ſéemed dead, albeit ſhe ſtood vpright on her féet: whereat he was ſo affrighted, that ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting quickly vp, he gaue another thruſt at the Lyon, which made the beaſt to tumble along, and beating him ſelfe a while againſt the ground, at laſt he was quite depriued of life.</p>
               <p>Then went <hi>Primaleon</hi> into the chamber where the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die was, and going reuerently neere her, tooke her by the hand, which he felt to be ſo cold, as if it had beene a hand of marble, in all which time ſhe moued not a iote, but ſtoode ſo ſtill as if ſhe were dead. Such was his greefe to ſee her in this ſort, as he grew into a great impatience, and profferd to carry her out of that chamber, to try if any where elſe he could be better comforted: but as hee laide holde on her to beare her thence, there ſuddainly ſtarted vp from vnder a great ſtone, two wild Saluage men, with clubs of yron in theyr hands, and at each clubbe hung foure great chaines, with bigge yron balls faſtned to them: very furiouſly ſmote they at <hi>Primaleon,</hi> and beate him ſo about the head with the balls of yron, that he fell downe on the floore, when the Saluage men taking him vp betweene them, intended to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This is no place (Gentlemen) for quarrell &amp; contention, forbeare then (wée pray you) till wee come to Land, where either of you may maintaine his argument of loue and valour.</p>
               <p>Theſe reaſonable ſpéeches pacified the Knights, but for no longer time then they ſhould be landed: ſo the Barque

The boone (quoth <hi>Tarnaes</hi>) which we vrge yée to grant, is, that (now wee are héere landed) you would folow your beſt intended courſes, and leaue vs to try the effect of our contention. Greatly it diſpleaſed <hi>Oliuanto</hi> and <hi>Floraman,</hi> that they had ſo raſhly paſſed ſuch a promiſe, but becauſe honour tyed them ſtrictly to their word, they left them, and parted toward <hi>Constantinople, <hi>Oliuanto</hi>

               <p>This equalitie in courage ſo long continued, that wound for wound was readily deliuered, their bodies and Armour pittifully mangled, but yet the hurts not déeply entring, by reaſon their dexteritie and ſkill much holpe them, which is a matter of great conſequence in a combate triall, where both parts are of equall valour, and knowledge. Til about mid-day thus laſted the difference, their bloode (in manie places) altering the cullour of their Armour, when at laſt <hi>Tarnaes</hi> thus ſpake to <hi>Leonato.</hi> You ſee (Sir) in what eſtate we are both brought, yet neither of vs certaine who ſhall haue the victory, therefore (ſo pleaſe you) wéele pauſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while, and putting off our Armour, wee ſhall ſoone make

               <p>When the Squires beheld their Lordes in ſo apparant perrill of their liues, they intended to make out vnto the roade wayes, in hope to find ſome Knight that might come to pacifie them: and purſuing their purpoſe, they were no ſooner entred vpon the high-way, but they ſawe a Knight come riding toward them, ſeeming anſwerable in courage to either of theyr Maiſters, to him thus ſpake one of the Squires.

Thou truly valiant, and worthily renowned Knight of Fortune, right well I wote, that your heart nowe tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailes with no other thoughts, but onely how to eſpouſe the faire <hi>Victoria,</hi> whom you haue with ſuch honour and déere paines deſerued: Yet fauour me to tell you, that in reſpect you are Nephewe to my Lord the Emperour, it is neceſſary that he ſhould beſtow ſo great a gift on you, for neither dare her Father nor I deale in the matrimoniall contract, before his highnes pleaſure be firſt vnderſtood.

                  <hi>Primaleon,</hi> though but young, yet being wiſe &amp; diſcreete, allowed the wizzards counſaile to be ſound and good, and therefore without dwelling vpon any other doubts, he went to the Prince <hi>Florian,</hi> (who was reaſoning with his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, concerning <hi>Primaleons</hi> valour and vertues, to tempt and try her diſpoſition toward him, becauſe already he had determined in his owne minde, frankly to beſtow her vpon him in marriage,) <hi>Primaleon</hi> being come to him, ſpake in

               <p>So <hi>Primaleon</hi> leauing them, went aboorde a little Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, which (by <hi>Aliartes</hi> appointment) ſet ſaile for <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> and in fewe dayes he came within foure miles of the Citty, when (becauſe it was night) he tooke vp his lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging in the neighbouring village. <hi>Arguto</hi> making cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine account, that <hi>Primaleon</hi> would come with <hi>Florian</hi> and <hi>Victoria,</hi> vſed often to ſtray abroad from <hi>Constantinople,</hi> hauing ſtill a care what Shippes tooke landing, becauſe he longed to encounter <hi>Primaleon,</hi> for the vtmoſt proofe of his ability in Armes. So it happened, that as <hi>Primaleon</hi> came from his Inne in the morning, <hi>Arguto</hi> met him, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, by reaſon he wore not his helmet, he ſpake as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth. Sir Knight, put on your helmet, and that ſpeedily, for I am to try the combate with you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Primaleon</hi> muſed a little to himſelfe, returning no aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, becauſe he knew not the man that challenged him, for <hi>Arguto</hi> had couered his Shéelde of the Sunne, becauſe hee would by no meanes be knowne: but at laſt, without ſpeaking any word at all, hauing laced on his helmet, hee
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:14347:232"/>
turned his horſe for the courſe, ſo did <hi>Arguto,</hi> with a minde full of furious deſire to wound his contrary, the other being nothing ſo much mooued, becauſe he knew not with whom hee ſhould encounter, which made <hi>Arguto</hi> to receaue the greater aduantage in the ſhock, in being not ſtird a iote by his aduerſaries Launce, but <hi>Primaleon</hi> loſt one of his ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropes. This ſéemed ſomewhat ſtrange to him, and made him forgetfull of his former patience, his imagination pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently apprehending, that doubtleſſe his enemie was <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guto,</hi> whoſe enuious nature (toward him) excéeded all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie compaſſe, wherefore now he purpoſed verily his death, to be rid of ſuch a riuall both in his loue and honour, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king another Launce, prepared to the ſecond encounter, whereof <hi>Arguto</hi> made no refuſall, but met him with ſuch a furious diſdaine, that he was caſt out of his ſaddle on the crooper of his Horſe, very hardly eſcaping the fall, and <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maleon</hi> was ſet vpon his Horſe buttocks, but not in perrill of any fall: ſo, both recouering their ſeates againe, they charged a freſh for the third triall.</p>
               <p>Now met they together with ſuch maine violence, that the girtes of <hi>Argutoes</hi> ſaddle breaking, hee tumbled back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the ground, being ſhrewdly bruſed with the fall: but <hi>Primaleons</hi> Horſe (by ouer-great miſhap) brake his two fore legges, and falling to the earth, chaunced to ſtampe one of his hinde féete vppon his Maiſters foote, ſo that both were faine to lie a while and reſt them ſelues. But hauing recouered footing, they came together with their ſwordes drawne, <hi>Primaleon</hi> féeling his foote ſomewhat ſtonned, with the tread which his Horſe had giuen him vpon it, yet did he carrie him ſelfe with ſuch ſprightly agilitie, that his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie diſcerned not any impediment at all. Now flew their weapons ſo nimbly about them, that in their careleſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of defence, they were both wounded, <hi>Arguto</hi> in the right ſide, and <hi>Primaleon</hi> vppon the left legge: neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the battaile endured in ſuch ſort, as if they had but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly begun the ſame, and they that came to be beholders thereof, iudged <hi>Arguto</hi> to be the fiercer, becauſe <hi>Primaleon</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14347:233"/>
ſéemed to limpe a little, onely by the paine he felt of his foot. So long laſted this combate, that their armour beeing he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen in peeces from about them, and their bodies wounded in many places, a multitude of people flocking thether to ſée the ouent, and admiring the ſtearne reſolution in ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: coniectured (as well they might) that if they were not the ſooner ſundered, the liues of them both perforce muſt miſcarie, where-vpon diuers ranne and galloped to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> carrying ſuch newes héereof to the Pallace, that <hi>Palmerin, Florendos, Floraman, Leonato, Tarnaes,</hi> (who were all there the day before arriued) preſently armed them ſelues, and departed thence with all poſſible ſpeede, to ſaue the liues of two ſuch hardy Knights.</p>
               <p>No ſooner were they come thether, but they vnderſtoode immediatly, that one of them was <hi>Primaleon,</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Florendos,</hi> and to know the other, <hi>Palmerin</hi> called vnto <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gutoes</hi> Squire, and prayed him (for ſafety of his Maiſters life) to let him vnderſtand of whence he was. The Squire beeing honeſt and wiſe, knowing hee would haue intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of his Lord, though not by him, tolde him, that his Maiſters name was <hi>Arguto.</hi> Greatly did it gréeue both him and the reſt, to ſée Lords (of one Court) in ſuch furie thus hand to hand, ſo that they ſtept betwéene and labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to appeaſe them: but they (without any reſpect to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers friendly endeuour) by no meanes would be pacified, but ſtriking at them, to get foorth from amongſt them, ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med tenne times more violent againſt each other then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and all the others honeſt labour prooued but in vaine. When they perceaued that they might not preuaile with them, and their lauiſh expence of blood, deliuered appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant daunger of their liues: they concluded, that <hi>Leonato</hi> ſhould poaſt to the Emperour, to entreate him (for ſafety of <hi>Arguto</hi> and his Nephewe <hi>Primaleons</hi> life) he would come thether with all haſt poſſible.</p>
               <p>When the Emperour heard theſe tidings, immediatly he deſcended the ſteps of the Pallace, and mounting vpon an eaſie Ambler, in leſſe then halfe an houre he came to the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:14347:233"/>
Combattants: whoſe extremitie of fury was indifferently qualified, becauſe both wearineſſe and loſſe of blood had ſo weakened them, as their blowes nowe did but very little harme. The Emperour riding in betwéene them, ſpake in this manner. I halfe perſwaded my ſelfe, that you young Knights, woulde maintaine the royall reputation of my Court: but nowe I ſee, that you rather endeuour to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw it, in ſéeking ſo cruelly to violence one another. Let me vnderſtand the cauſe of your contention, and I will ſo order and accomodate the caſe, as neither of your honours ſhall thereby be impaired.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Primaleon</hi> hearing his Grandfather ſpeake, reuerently gaue backe, ſaying. Truſt me my Lord, I know not the leaſt particle of any cauſe, wherefore this Knight ſhould thus combate with me, for I am vtterly ignorant what he is: onely it pleaſed him to take knowledge of me, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke me to the fight with chalenging tearmes, neuer yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding me any reaſon of his diſcontentment, or how, or wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I haue offended him. Then the Emperour turned to <hi>Arguto,</hi> to knowe whence the cauſe of this preſumptuous quarrell grew: when he (more in reuerence to ſo great a commaund, then otherwiſe) declared all at large, howe in reſpect of the loue he bare to the faire Lady <hi>Victoria,</hi> he had borne a long enuious ſpléen to <hi>Primaleon</hi>: but more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, how duly he had awaited this opportunity, to try which of them two was the ableſt man at Armes. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, (loth to hold them there in ſuch euident perill,) promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to carrie ſuch an euen hand in this cauſe of their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, as each of them ſhould be wel ſatiſfied therewith, both in enioying wiues to eithers good liking, &amp; alſo in this ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous caſe of their valour, wherein, neither was reputed inferiour to the other, by their late ouer-bold and hazardous triall. But (quoth he) I am lately informed of an intended war, leueyed by <hi>Corcuto</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Albayzar,</hi> &amp; now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalled Souldane of <hi>Babilon,</hi> prepared only againſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: there wil be a better triall of manhood vpon Gods ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie and ours, then thus one friend to miſentreate another.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14347:234" rendition="simple:additions"/>Vppon theſe ſpéeches the Knights were pacified, and preſently two ſumptuous Litters were brought from the Court, where-into (after by the Emperours commaund, the Knights had embraced each other, and ſolemnly prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted a league of friendſhip) they were ſoftly laide, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> were lodged in one goodlie chamber, wherein two beds were purpoſely placed. Now ranne a certaine muttering among the other Lords, which of theſe two Knights might bee reckoned as the hardieſt warriour, in regard they were both ſore wounded, and ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers eſtate was cenſured vpon, <hi>Primaleons</hi> greateſt harme being thought the bruſe of his foote, but <hi>Arguto</hi> had recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued moſt hurts, and his armour was battered farre woorſe then <hi>Primaleons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Emperour and the other Princes, came daily to viſite theſe wounded Knights, of whoſe liues the Chirurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as yet ſtoode in doubt, eſpecially of <hi>Arguto,</hi> becauſe hee had a daungerous hurt in his throate: to them likewiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted all the Princeſſes in the Court, of whom, the moſt impatient in gréefe, was the Empreſſe <hi>Gridonia</hi> and the Princeſſe <hi>Miragarda,</hi> in their iuſt compaſſion of <hi>Primaleons</hi> perill.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou remember, that when <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maleon</hi> ſet away for <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> we left <hi>Aliarte, Florian,</hi> and <hi>Victoria</hi> ſtil at the Iland, where the wizzard diſcourſing with the Prince, about giuing his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Victoria</hi> in marriage to the Knight, who (ending the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chauntment) had ſo highly deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued her: and he found him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to right willingly addicted, prouided, that the Emperour miſliked not thereof. So taking with him the booke before remembred, which ſometime belonged to Quéene <hi>Melia,</hi> they entred into a veſſell of larger fruite, then the other which he had ſent away before, as being iealous of ſome diſaſter, which <hi>Druſa Velonna</hi> might worke againſt them.

               <p>As thus he ſate tranſported with varietie of paſſions, he ſawe a darke cloud ſuddainly to engirt the Shippe, and out

               <p>The Wizzard <hi>Aliarte,</hi> hauing brought faire <hi>Victoria</hi> a ſhoare, eſpied firſt the Princeſſe <hi>Polinarda,</hi> and with her was <hi>Floraman</hi> come to ſée the young Lady, ſo mounting on horſebacke, they rode into the Citty, and being alighted at the Pallace, all the Princeſſes and Ladies deſcended the ſteppes, to entertaine the beautifull <hi>Victoria,</hi> where paſt ſuch kiſſes and kinde embraces, as truly reported the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they bare her. <hi>Aliarte</hi> hauing kiſſed the Emperours hand, was loth to ſlack time ouer-long for helpe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Knights, wherefore, being deſirous to ſée them, <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos</hi> and <hi>Palmerin</hi> taking him by each hand, they brought him to the Chamber where they languiſhed in paine, onely through the ſmall hope they had of amendment, but when they beheld the wizzard <hi>Aliarte,</hi> their former doubts were remooued, and nowe (by his meanes) they were halfe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of immediate recouery. He going ſeuerally to the bed of either Knight, whiſpered thus in their eares: I am come to helpe your greateſt extreamitie, &amp; to procure your harts long wiſhed contentment.</p>
               <p>This promiſe ſo cheered their former drooping mindes, that he applying his precious oyles and vnguents to theyr woundes, made them expreſſe the next morning, manifeſt ſignes of a much better condition, and within eyght dayes they were ſo well amended, that they were able to goe kiſſe the Emperours hand, who welcommed them with a chéer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full countenaunce, not vnmindfull of the honourable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe he had made them. After ſome priuate conference had with <hi>Aliarte,</hi> his Maieſtie ſent for <hi>Florendos, Palmerin, Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raman</hi> and the reſt, whom he acquainted with his determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and found each man thereto agréeable, except vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate <hi>Floraman</hi>: who perceiuing that his own tongue muſt confirme her marriage to another, whom hee beyond all women in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world moſt déerely affected, when his turne came to ſpeake, hee ſtoode awhile ſilent, as inwardly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
<pb facs="tcp:14347:236"/>
with extremity of paſſion.

               <p>
                  <hi>Floraman,</hi> hearing the diſmall ſentence againſt his ioyes for euer, ſtepping forth before them in the midſt of the hall, thus began. Moſt mighty Emperour, I haue found by true experience, that to be a louer, hath béen the onely infelicity awayting on my life. Firſt I loued <hi>Altea,</hi> and by her death my loue proued fruitleſſe, after which, long time I liued diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolate, till vainly dreaming, that better happe might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide me, I became enamoured of <hi>Clariana,</hi> who reiected me with a ſcornfull diſdaine, as iuſtly my breach of faith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, vowed to the ghoſt of my deceaſed <hi>Altea.</hi> But then a worſe affliction befell me, and a third amourous humour enthralled my ſences, namely, to the faire Lady <hi>Victoria,</hi> whoſe mariage now being likewiſe agréed vpon, giues me yet this benefit, that I may liue heereafter among poore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed Louers, performing ſome rare and memorable acte, that may regiſter the fame of her beautie to all poſterities.</p>
               <p>No ſooner had he thus ſpoken, but ſetting the pommell of his ſword againſt the ground, hee fell ſuddenly vppon the poynt thereof, which paſt quite thorow his body, before any Knight could lay hand vpon him, albeit they ranne to ſtay him as ſpéedily as they could. This deſperate miſhappe of <hi>Floraman</hi> was generally lamented, and the Emperor him ſelfe tooke it very grieuouſly, becauſe <hi>Floraman</hi> had béene a Knight of good eſtéeme, and euer-more faithfull to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour: notwithſtanding, ſeeing ſadneſſe and ſorrow could not nowe redreſſe it, they concluded to honour him with a royall buriall.</p>

               <p>Vpon the Sonday following, as the Knights ſate plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly diſpoſed in the Hall after dinner, entercourſing ſuch deuiſes as themſelues thought meeteſt, they heard a great noyſe in the ayre ouer the Pallace, and ſtarting vp to be further reſolued thereof, they ſawe an armed Knight enter at one of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> windowes, with a huge crooked bill in his hand, which (clapping to the ground before the Emperour and them all) he thus began. Inuinſible Monarche, I am the moſt vnfortunate Knight, which liues at this day in the world: but not to make ſad this mirthfull Court with my miſhaps, I wil conceale my diſgraces, &amp; acquaint ye onely with the cauſe of my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming hether. Briefely then (dread Lord) to finde ſome eaſe for my inſupportable miſerie, I néede the ayde of ſome valiant Knight héere in your Court: hauing thus ſpoken, he ſtoode ſilent, as expecting an aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere.</p>
               <p>The Emperour, although hee deſired that his Court might be famous, yet in regarde ſo many gallant bloods were there preſent, he ſtoode in doubt whom he ſhould elect for this enterpriſe, without giuing offence to all the reſt: and (indéede) a great murmuring aroſe in the Hall, becauſe euery man expreſt himſelfe ready, and it was doubtful leaſt ſome diſcord would ariſe among them, which nothing but the Emperours preſence did hinder, for <hi>Florendos</hi> and his ſonne <hi>Primaleon</hi> fell to thwarting ſpéeches, either ſcorning to giue the other place in matter of honour.</p>
               <p>While the Court continued in this ſpléenefull humour, the Knight well perceiuing it, and fearing if any diſorder
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:14347:237"/>
enſued, he might depart thence without any aſſiſtance, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſting to be heard, he thus procéeded. Great Emperour, let me intreate this gracious fauour, that I may my ſelfe make choiſe of the Knight, whom I ſhal imagine as méeteſt for my purpoſe. With all my hart, replied the Emperour: as iudging this the likelieſt way to auoyde all partialitie, and qualifie the diſcord among his Knights. Firſt, (quoth the Knight) I deſire to knowe the Emperours Nephew, named <hi>Primaleon,</hi> and becauſe not farre from the place of my torments, there liues in the like miſery a noble Ladie, the onely woman that euer made proofe of her loyaltie: I would likewiſe haue another Knight, called <hi>Arguto,</hi> who I am aſſured will as honourably end this aduenture, as he effected that of the enchaunted Sepulcher.</p>
               <p>Theſe two young gallants, who had almoſt renewed their auncient enmitie, as couetous of this honourable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, when they ſaw this election made of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> twaine, before all the other great ſpirits of the Court, they were highly pleaſed: and becauſe the Knight was vppon his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, they craued licence of the Emperour and all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Princes, then knéeling before their affianced Ladies, they deſired to kiſſe their hands, and bare the title of theyr Knights. <hi>Victoria,</hi> knowing how long time <hi>Primaleon</hi> had loued her, moſt kindly embraced him, ſaying: Seeing it pleaſeth my Lord the Emperor, and my noble Father, that hereafter I muſt be yours in marriage, I accept you, not ſo much for my Knight, as for my Lorde and chiefe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunder. But <hi>Concordia,</hi> béeing ſlenderly ſkild in loues affaires, knew not what to anſwere, but that ſhe was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, and if her worth might make him glorious, ſhe told him plainly he ſhould one day haue it.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe theſe young and amourous bloods, thought time neuer long enough in theſe kind of purpoſes, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Knight with whom they were to depart, clapping each of them vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the ſhoulder, ſaid. Young Lords, ſo important is the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines which I muſt bring you to, that it will put yée paſt the remembrance of theſe faire Ladies. The Knights thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waked
<pb facs="tcp:14347:238"/>
from their louely traunce, preſently aroſe, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their leaue, went to put on their Armour, returning in ſhort while right gallantly appointed. Then did y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Knight cauſe a Ship of Chriſtall to floate about the Hall, wherein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to he conducted ſeuerally the Knights, &amp; preſently it moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vp into the ayre, fléeting away with ſuch wonderfull ſwiftnes, as all of them had quickly left the ſight of it: to the great admiration of the Emperour, and extreame griefe of poore <hi>Victoria,</hi> who rather could haue wiſhed with al her hart, that her Knight had ſtaied to effect her marriage.</p>
               <p>The Ship in two houres ſpace was gone ſo farre, that the Knights thought they were brought to the furtheſt part of the worlde, when ſuddenly the Ship falling downe on a great ſtone, ſéemed as if it was ſhiuerd all in peeces, and they thought themſelues likewiſe to be broken in the ſame manner, whereat the ſtrange Knight laughed hartilie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knew it was but a vaine apparition. So mightie was the fall of the Ship on the ſtone, as if it had béen made of the hardeſt yron, it had béen ſufficient to haue broken it, but the enchauntment beeing of greater power, made it ſtand whole and ſound vpright on the ſtone: when they iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing foorth, followed the Knight, and he being theyr guide ſome ſmall diſtance thence, went downe into a Caue that ſéemed very darke, beckning to <hi>Primaleon</hi> that he ſhould follow him, and <hi>Arguto</hi> to ſtay till he returned. It was not long before he came backe againe, and then went toward a huge thicke Wood, whereinto hee wafted him with his hand to enter, and ſo <hi>Arguto</hi> very reſolutely did.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Rimaleon</hi> being thus within the Caue, went downward aboue a mile by eſtimation, not diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning any light all the way hee had gone, till at laſt hee came to certaine high windowes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſome ſmall glimmering en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the Caue. Still paſt he on along, till at length hee eſpied a Wall, which was built with the bones of dead men and beaſts, and therein was a gate made all with the heads of men, ſerpents, horſes and Grif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fons, in a cunning diuerſitie mingled together, whereby he gathered, that it had béen the handy-worke of men.</p>
               <p>Boldly ſtept <hi>Primaleon</hi> in at this gate, but afterward he was ſorry he had aduentured ſo farre, for hee ſaw it was a ſpacious ſquare plot, being round about encloſed with that wall, at the further ſide whereof hee ſawe a higher gate, where there ſtoode a beaſt greater then any Elephant, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his head directly toward him, and feeding on diuers mangled bodies, which were ſliced into ſo many péeces, that he could not geſſe whether they were men or beaſtes. No ſooner had hee ſtept a little forward, but this hideous beaſt, as if he were extremely hunger-ſtarued, came main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt him, when <hi>Primaleon</hi> (as loth to be deuoured by ſo rauenous a Monſter) hauing his ſworde ready drawne, gaue him a mightie blow vppon the head, but the ſword re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded back againe vnto him, as if he had ſmitten vppon a hard ſtone. Then lifted y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beaſt vp ſuddenly one of his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feete, before <hi>Primaleon</hi> had ſufficiently retired, and faſtning hold vpon his pouldron, rent it quite away, &amp; miſt verie lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, of wreſting the ſword from forth of his hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14347:239"/>This graſpe of the Monſter, gaue him plainly to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that hee muſt not receiue ſuch another gripe from him, except hee meant to part with life and all, wherefore, keeping him off with his weapon ſo well as he could, he gaue the Monſter diuers wounds in the midſt of his body, and albeit the hurts were ſoundly giuen indeede, yet was the beaſt of ſuch a wonderful groſſenes, as they pierced not into any of the vitall parts. While the battaile thus conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, he noated a matter moſt admirable to be reported, for of the blood which iſſued foorth of the Monſters woundes, aroſe vp ſundry ſtrange miſhapen beaſts, beeing ſome of them which he had before deuoured, and they went aſide into an angle of the roome, menacing <hi>Primaleon</hi> with their lookes and howlings, as if they intended ſome miſchiefe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him.</p>
               <p>By this time was our Champion ſo ouer-toyled, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing almoſt out of breath, he was glad to ſhift from place to place, yet with a héedfull eye to the Monſter, inuoking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly the helpe of heauen, to ſtrengthen him in ſo great an extreamitie: in which meditation of minde, hee beheld the Knight which had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ducted him thether, enter in at the gate with the hooked Bill on his back, and oppoſed himſelfe againſt the Monſter, which preſently left <hi>Primaleon,</hi> &amp; (as bearing deadly hatred to the Knight) turned furiouſly vpon him. So dexteriouſly did the Knight handle his bill, that he wounded the Monſter in many places therwith, and ſtil as blood ſtreamed from him, aroſe ſundry kindes of ſtrange beaſts, all which (at one loude groane giuen by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Monſter) ran furiouſly vpon the Knight, &amp; rent him in innumerable péeces, which were al afterward ſuddenly ſwalowed by the monſter himſelfe, the bil only left lying on the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. This ſudden death &amp; deuouring of the Knight, droue <hi>Primaleon</hi> to ſome little amazement, and perceiuing the monſter, now to make a freſh toward him, bethought him of the bill, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Knight had fought ſo nimbly, and giuen diuers ſhrewd hurts to the beaſt, that ſome vertue (touching the enchauntment) might remaine in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="233" facs="tcp:14347:239"/>Quickly he caught it vp in his hand, and although he had no great ſkill in the vſe of ſuch a weapon, becauſe it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing appertained to Knighthoode, yet hee made it to ſerue his turne in ſuch ſort, as at euery blow he drew blood from the beaſt: and happening at laſt to wounde him in the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, he perceaued the hurt to open ſo wide, that the Knight leapt foorth vpon his féete aliue and well, and hee wreſting again forcibly the Bill from <hi>Primaleon,</hi> gaue a freſh charge vppon the Monſter, whoſe belly immediatly was become whole and ſound. The other beaſts, which ſtill roſe vp out of the Monſters blood, as they had done before, tore him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in péeces, and the Monſter quickly ſwallowed him vp, when <hi>Primaleon</hi> recouering the Bill once more, defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him ſelfe there-with againſt the huge beaſt, who now (by reaſon of his many woundes and loſſe of much blood) went ſomewhat faintly vp and downe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Primaleon</hi> taking good notice thereof, conceaued in his minde, that if he could diſpatch the other leſſer beaſts, the Knight ſhould no more be torne in péeces: where-vpon he fiercely made againſt them, cutting a many of them off by the legges, whereby they being abandoned of the enchaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, could riſe no more, their legges in this manner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parted from their bodies. Hée made ſuch a ſlaughter of theſe beaſts, that but very fewe of them remained aliue, all which ranne ſpéedily behinde the great Monſter, where in a moment they had bound vp his woundes, as hee ſéemed now as able as euer.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Primaleon</hi> ſaw the Monſter ſo ſtrangely recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, hee had good cauſe to doubt the iſſue of his enterpriſe, notwithſtanding, he gaue the beaſt ſharper wounds then he had doone before, with a ſetled reſolution to die or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer: and caſting his head aſide, he behelde the Knight to ſtand hard by him, who taking the Bill againe from <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maleon,</hi> with very great courage aſſayled the Monſter. Right quickly did the beaſt catch him by the arme, &amp; fling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him aloft, caſt him quite ouer beyond the wall, ſo that <hi>Primaleon</hi> knew not what was become of him, and hauing

Neuer waſt time (Sir) in killing of this Monſter, but goe you onward, and you ſhall behold me in ſuch mercileſſe torments, as are to continue many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of yeares, except by your vertue onely I may be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered. No ſooner had he thus ſpoken, but <hi>Primaleon</hi> ſawe him diue into a deepe water, whereon he had not looked very long, but ſuddainly there aroſe vp a goodly Tower, engirt round about with the water that ran very ſwiftly, &amp; two ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage Beares he ſawe running about the Tower, purſuing the Knight who fled before them, &amp; euer as they caught hold of him, they bit him moſt cruelly, ſo ran they with him into the Tower, where (out of a window) he heaued vp his hands to <hi>Primaleon,</hi> deſiring him to take pitty &amp; come to help him, which mooued his minde to ſuch compaſſion, as hee would gladly haue paſt through a thouſand waters to yéelde him ſuccour. After he had walked on the bancks a while about the water, to ſee if he could finde any place for paſſage, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held from a window a great Baſket let downe, which the two Beares droue toward him from the Rock, as deſirous to haue him leape into it, &amp; they would thereby conuay him to the Tower: but the Knight cried to him out at another window, that by no meanes he ſhould accept their ſubtill of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, but ſtay, and awaite a better meanes of bringing him to the Rock, where-vpon, the Beares more and more labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red toward him with the Baſket, making ſignes, as if hee could haue no other paſſage. <hi>Primaleon</hi> ſtill thruſt away the Baſket from him, &amp; perceauing no liuely way to helpe him to the Tower, in the ſelfe ſame place where he ſaw the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:14347:240"/>
Knight diue, there did he likewiſe boldly caſt in him ſelfe, and aroſe at the Tower againe, as the Knight before did: but as he offered to mount y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſteps to enter, the Beares flew vpon him with ſuch maine violence, that one of them griped him ſo ſtrongly by the head, as he had almoſt falne downe in a ſwoune. But his dauntleſſe ſpirit ſcorning all ſeruile feare, quickly ſhook off this paſſion, &amp; hauing the Bill in his hand, which he would not willingly part withall, he gaue one of the Beares ſuch a blow therewith on the head, that a great part of it fell on the ground: in this while, the other Beare ſo gript him about the body with his pawes, as hee was no way able to ſtir him ſelfe, &amp; the wounded Beare got ſo ſtrong hold of his leg, (being furiouſly mad with his neere approching death) that bruſing in péeces his armed greaues or gamaſhes, made him to féele intollerable paine. But now did <hi>Primaleon</hi> moſt manifeſtly declare, that his equall (for chiualry and valour) liued not in the world, for he cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Beare faſt by the throate, to make him looſe his horrible gripes, tweakt his weazand with ſuch ſtrength, that he well-néere ſtrangled him, when ſéeing him ſelfe at liberty, he ſtill held his holde with one hand, and drawing forth his dagger with the other, gaue ſo many ſtabs vpon the beaſts throat, that he fell downe dead, and both the Beares bodies immediatly vaniſhed, to the no little admiration of <hi>Primaleon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then aſcended he the ſteppes, thinking he had alreadie concluded the aduenture, but the Knight, for whoſe deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance he had thus dangerouſly aduentured, ſnatcht the Bill out of his hand, as before hee had doone, in the perilous fight betweene him and the Monſter, whereof <hi>Primaleon</hi> making no reckoning, nor miſtruſting any ill intent in him, thought hee might with more ſafety mount vp the ſtaires. But the Knight oppoſed the Bill to his breaſt, as if hee meant to kill him there-with, which vngentle act in him, greeued <hi>Primaleon</hi> more then all his paines had doone, in that hee rather expected aſſiſtaunce at his hand, then thus to threaten his life, as ſtill hee did: where-vpon, his
<pb facs="tcp:14347:241"/>
pacience conuerting to angry choller, he made an offer to ſmite at the Knight with his ſword, but then was hee ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly metamorphozed to a Leopard, and aſſayled <hi>Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon</hi> ſo cruelly with his téeth and nailes, as hee was diuers times in very deſperate hazards.</p>
               <p>Nowe would he either be a conquerour, or elſe Deaths captiue, and perceauing the beaſt to ſtande vpright on his hinder féete, he threw by his ſword, and cloſed with him as if they would wraſtle: but <hi>Primaleons</hi> armes excéeding the beaſts legges in length, gaue him ſuch a graſpe vpon an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage, that the beaſt was almoſt thratled, and fearing leaſt he ſhould die in that manner, he called thus to him in his manly voyce. Alas Sir Knight, the continuall torment I haue ſuffered ſo many yeares already, me thinkes your ſelfe might account ſufficient, and not paine me more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene your ſtrong armes. But notwithſtanding theſe ſpeeches, and diuers other entreates deliuered like a man, <hi>Primaleon</hi> would not let him at liberty, but held him ſtifly ſtill, (by what meanes I knowe not) from the forme of a Leopard, he changed again to the ſelfe ſame ſhape, as when he firſt conducted him into the Caue, when expreſſing ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full lookes, hee thus ſpake to <hi>Primaleon.</hi> Well maiſt thou vaunt thy ſelfe to be the beſt Knight in the world, in being able to accompliſh ſo dreadfull an aduenture.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Primaleon</hi> heard him ſpeake ſo humanely, he let goe his holde, and ſuddainly appeared to them an auncient Knight, who was Lord of the Tower, and an expert Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gromancer, being father to the Lady, which was to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franchiſed from her thraldome by <hi>Arguto,</hi> with very ſad looks he began in this maner. It greeues me (Sir Knight) that it is your fortune to ſet at liberty, this wretched man and diſloyall Louer, from the enchauntment wherein I had confinde him, as purpoſing to haue his ſinne ſufficiently puniſhed: and much more it offendes mee, that the other Knight which came with you, ſhall likewiſe ende the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chauntment of the indiſcréet Girle my daughter, the whole ſtate whereof I wil more at large acquaint you with, when

               <p>Héereby he gathered, that except he were more héedefull of this villaines hand, he might ſoone there be murdered, a matter more hatefull to a generous nature, to periſh by the trecherie of ſuch a villaine, then the cruelleſt death he could receaue from the weapon of a Knight, where-vpon, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth his ſword, which all this while he refuſed to doo, becauſe the villaine had no other weapon then a knife, hee ſpake to him thus.

               <p>Hauing thus ſpoken, he deliuered a very fierce ſtroke at the villaine, which cunningly hee receaued vpon his long knife, and helde out againſt <hi>Arguto</hi> with ſuch dauntleſſe courage, that albeit he was vnarmed, he was ſo ready eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie way with his knife, as, doo what the Knight could, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt euery ſtroke it was ſtill his defence, and no where could they light but only on the knife. Aboue an houre and more the fight thus continued, in which time, <hi>Arguto</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:14347:242"/>
with him ſelfe, in what part of him the force of the enchauntment lay, whereby the villaine was able to ſtand ſo long againſt him, and yet all his paines no more to enda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage him. At laſt, by wary obſeruation he perceaued, that he defended himſelfe onely with his right hand, managing his knife there-with as him ſelfe pleaſed, and helde his left hand directly behinde him, neuer offering it forward, either to breake, awarde, or put by any blow: héere-vpon he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended this imagination, that if hee could compaſſe to hurt him in the left hand, hee might the ſooner preuaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him.</p>
               <p>Now began he to make all his ayme that way, and the villaine well perceauing it, was the more diligent to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent him with his knife, and defended his left hand with meruailous carefulnes, ſo that neuer a thruſt or blow could once come néere it. Neuertheleſſe, among the multitude of mighty maine ſtrokes, one (by good hap) miſt the villaines knife, and lighting betwéene his arme and body, did quite cut off his left hand: but the villaine catching it vp quickly with the other hand, ranne away from him ſo ſpéedily, that he could ſcarce diſcerne which way he tooke, and the Lady likewiſe, lying all this while as quite bereft of life, ſtarting ſuddainly vp on her feete, fled away from him he knew not how. To ſee them both gone in this ſtraunge order, made him wonder thereat not a little in his minde, and entring the Tent to reſt him ſelfe a while, he was ſcarſly ſet down, but a Satire all couered with long ſhaggie haire, holding a young trée in his hand as his weapon, came in vpon him, ſaying with a loude and hollow voyce. Miſchaunce (and not good fortune) brought thee into this Wood, where who ſoeuer enters, muſt die the death.</p>
               <p>As he had ſpoken theſe words, he gaue him ſuch a cruell blow with his bat, that bruſing his helmet very ſhrewdly, made him ſo aſtonned, that as he thought to riſe, he ſtaggerd to and fro: where-vpon, the Satire ſeeing him in ſuch an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement, caught him vp in his armes, and ranne away with him toward a Fountaine, meaning to make him drink
<pb facs="tcp:14347:243"/>
more then he ſtood in néede of. He had not gone aboue halfe a bowe-ſhoote, but <hi>Arguto</hi> recouering his former ſpirits, puld the Satire ſo ſtrongly by the long haire, that the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter (growing angry to be haled in ſuch rude ſort) threwe <hi>Arguto</hi> with ſuch violence againſt a huge flint, as he made him lie ſtill enough from ſtirring in haſt, and but that the Satire had not his trée there with him, our Knight had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer gone thence to ſée his <hi>Concordia.</hi> While the Monſter ranne backe to the Tent to fetch his trée, <hi>Arguto</hi> (being of an high and heroyick ſpirit) was gotten vp on his féete, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing to defend him ſelfe from any more ſuch blowes, and the Satire being returned to him, layd ſuch thicke and furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtrokes at him, that he could not retort one back againe at the Satire, but onely had worke enough to doo, to defend and beare off his angry blowes: for in regard of the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters nakednes, one blowe or thruſt of the Knights, (in his owne conceite) might eaſily haue ſped him. The battaile continuing in this manner, he ſaw the Lady come running toward him, with a naked Rapier in her throate, and pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully deſiring helpe at his hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arguto,</hi> who albeit he deſired the death of this Satire, hauing twiſe offended him in ſuch dangerous ſort, yet immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent &amp; extraordinary perill of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lady, made him forſake the Satire, and follow her, who guided him to a goodly plaine, where ſtoode ready armed thirty valiant Knights, all which engirt him preſently in a ring, and euery man had a maine ſtroke at him: but he (by good hap) ſtriking at one of them, his ſword lighted on the creſt of his helmet, where-vpon the Knight immediatly drew backe, as if he could endure the fight no longer.</p>
               <p>Heereby he halfe perſwaded him ſelfe, that the enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment conſiſted in the creſts of their helmets, and therefore ſhe ſhaped his ayme accordingly, whereby he quickly made many of them retire, when ſtepping foorth from amongſt them, he ſet his backe againſt a broad leaued Béech, where he both ſtoutly defended, and wel breathed him ſelfe. As he ſtoode thus oppreſt by the multitude of their blowes, fréely
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:14347:243"/>
deliuered on euery ſide, he eſpied the Satire come running thether, who laying hande on the Rapier in the Ladies throate, hurld her vppon his ſhoulder, and away he ranne againe with no meane haſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arguto</hi> was greatly grieued, to ſée her thus violentlie hurried thence, wherefore, in hope of recouering her, hee ventured to make his way through the Knights, and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his weapon with ſuch ſucceſſe among them, that by the blowes he gaue them on the Helmets, thrée onely of them remained to confront him, which thrée, either becauſe they durſt not contende any longer, or whether the enchaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would not permit them, they likewiſe right gladlie retired. This ſucceſſe was no little comfort to <hi>Arguto,</hi> and added a chéerefull perſwaſion of finiſhing the aduenture, ſo that neuer minding how weary he was, he went to purſue the Satire which had carried away the Lady, and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till Monſter, making a mock at <hi>Argutos</hi> great labour, ran in and out leaping, ſkipping, and dauncing, neuer ſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing farre, but keeping ſtill néere him, the Lady continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly crying to the Knight for helpe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arguto</hi> melted with meere compaſſion, &amp; was extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tired with following the Satire, for the ſwifteſt Harior in the world could not haue out-ſtript him, much leſſe a man armed, and ouer-wearied with ſo long combatting. All which notwithſtanding, he would not as yet giue ouer his purſute, but noated ſtill the Satires friſkes and gambal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, often looking backe with mocks and gires at the Knight, till hee was ouer-reached in his owne folly, for dauncing careleſly, and looking backe at the very ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, he chaunced to ſtumble at the roote of a trée, and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling downe, the Lady eſcaped from him, running with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen armes vnto <hi>Arguto,</hi> and embraced him in ſuch forcible manner, as he could not deuiſe which way to ſtay himſelfe, which the Satire perceiuing, came backe againe toward him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arguto,</hi> béeing helde in this ſort by the Lady, and her leggs likewiſe faſt twined about his, he gathered héereby,
<pb facs="tcp:14347:244"/>
that albeit it was to his mightie encombrance, yet ſhee did it as loth the Satire ſhould ſeaze on her againe, nor coulde he ſhunne a dangerous blow which the Monſter gaue him with his tree, ſo that now hee was in two mightie extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, one, right fearefull of the Ladies iniurie, the other, that he had no meanes howe to helpe himſelfe, but doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe his life muſt there needes miſcarie. But ſée how it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned, the Satires tree ſmiting <hi>Arguto</hi> on the Helmet, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended vpon the Ladies ſhoulder, and ſuch was the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence of the blow, that ſhee (looſing her holde) tumbled downe backward.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Arguto</hi> ſawe himſelfe fréed from his former op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, he ſtept boldly to the Satire, &amp; giuing a full blow at the hand wherein he held the trée, cut it quite off, ſo that the Monſter roaring with ſence of his paine, fledde away from him ſo faſt as he could runne. The Lady lying all this while in a dead traunce, ſtarting vp on her féete, ſaid. Sir Knight, if thy hart ſerue thée ſo well, as that thou dareſt vndertake an attempt which I ſhall ſhewe thée, my hopes will then aſſuredly perſwade me, that not onely my ſelfe ſhall be freed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this enchauntment, but diuers other beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull Ladies beſide. Guide mee whether thou wilt, quoth <hi>Arguto,</hi> for a Knight ought not to queſtion after any caſe of perrill, but boldly aduenture on any enterpriſe of honour, whatſoeuer.</p>
               <p>So following the Lady, ſhee led him along a very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row crooked cauſey, till at length hee behelde a Tower, which ſeemed as if it were made of Siluer, and being come neere it, they ſaw an high engine of warre like a Ramme, made with a deuiſe to let vp and downe, ſuch as were vſed in elder times, before they had any knowledge of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, to hurle great ſtones, or any other annoyance ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with into a Towne or Caſtell. By this engine, quoth the Lady, muſt you gaine your entrance, and ſuffer your ſelfe to be throwne aloft vppon the Tower, becauſe there is no other paſſage admitted. <hi>Arguto</hi> tooke it very ſtrangelie, that he ſhould oppoſe his life to ſuch manifeſt perrill, but
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:14347:244"/>
his great courage, treading all feare vnder-foote, he boldly entred into the cradle fixed on the maine beame, being the receptacle for whatſoeuer ſhould paſſe into the Tower.</p>
               <p>No ſooner ſtoode he vpright in this conueyance, but he heard moſt delicate Muſique ſound within the Tower, as it ſéemed for ioy of libertie and fréedome, which the people there impriſoned hoped for by this Knight, who durſt ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenturouſly put himſelfe into the carriage, which no man (till now) was ſo hardie as to offer it. The engine ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mounting it ſelfe vp, in a moment hee was lifted aloft vpon the Tower, without any other harme or perrill at all, where-vpon the Muſique preſently ceaſſed, &amp; a great noyſe of Armour-clattering was heard, whereby hee expected ſome rough encounter. Then beheld he a wilde Beaſt ſo ſtrangely miſhapen, as he could not comprehend his true naturall forme: for he had the head of a Beare, the téeth and tuſhes of a Boare, the necke and breaſt of a Lyon, the tallants of a Griffon, and his taile deuided in two parts, hauing at each end a hooke of ſtéele, with the poynts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſo ſharpe and piercing, as they were able to enter the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſoundeſt proofe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arguto</hi> beeing well ſkild in ſuch matters of enchaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, perſwaded himſelfe, that with this Beaſt was the lateſt trouble he ſhould finde there, and therefore reſolued to ſhew his vttermoſt vallour. The Monſter was not ſlow in aſſayling him with ſuch fury, as would haue diſmaied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hart to behold it, hauing neuer ſeene ſo eugly a Monſter, but <hi>Arguto,</hi> purpoſing to kéepe off from his tallants and teeth, made many faire proffers to cut his leggs in ſunder, which the Monſter ſtill right cunningly auoyding, ſmote one of his long tuſhes into his Shield, and rent it from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his necke ſo forcibly, that he made him fall downe flat vppon his face, where he might haue béene preſt to death with the Monſters huge weight, but that right quickly he recouered footing againe, but he could not ſhunne a ſudden gripe with his tallants, which piercing through the cloſing of his Armour, wounded him a little in the left flanck.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14347:245"/>This hurt ſo much diſpleaſed <hi>Arguto,</hi> that ſtriking cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiouſly at the Monſter, he gaue him a great wound full in the breaſt, for which he receiued an immediate caſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by being ſmitten into the ſight of his Caſke with the Monſters tuſhe, which tearing downe the whole Beuer, gript his head with ſuch extreame anguiſh, that hee was conſtrained to cut the laces of his Helmet, and let it in that ſort be taken from him. Being thus without both Shielde and Helmet, his life ſtood on ſhrewd termes of hazard, and doubtleſſe had miſcaried, if he had not laboured to end the battaile in this manner.</p>
               <p>Feigning as if he could hold out no longer, he fell downe flat againe vppon his face, and the beaſt intending to teare him in peeces, ſtoode ſtradling ouer him, when ſtabbing his ſword vp into the Monſters belly, he made ſo large an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cition, that his bowels dropt out vpon the ground, and then <hi>Arguto</hi> crept from vnder him, leaſt with his huge weight he ſhould haue queld him. Now heard hee the Muſique a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, but with farre louder and ſwéeter ſtraines then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as ſéeming that the aduenture was almoſt concluded, and nowe came the Lady againe vnto him, with tenne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther faire beauties attending on her, all of them together ioyfully ſaying: <hi>Welcome the braueſt Knight that euer bare Armes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So taking him by the hand, they guided him thence, and brought him downe into a faire ſquare Court, where no doore could be diſcerned for paſſage out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Towre, which made him awhile to ſtand as abaſhed, doubting leaſt the Ladies intended ſome trecherie toward him, but one of them ſpake to him in this manner. Sir Knight, doe but lift vp this ſtone, and preſently the Towre will vaniſh, and the enchauntment ceaſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arguto,</hi> thinking nothing impoſſible for him to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, went to the ſtone, and putting his hand into a great yron ring, which was faſtened directly in the midſt of the ſtone, he lifted vp the huge ſtone, and threw it a pretty way from him, albeit it was ſo great and weightie, that tenne
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:14347:245"/>
ordinary men could hardly mooue it. Out of the place which the ſtone had couered, ſtarted vp the leaſt Dwarffe that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was ſéene, who ſkipping about very pleaſantly, tooke vp certaine glaſſes out of the vaulte, and breaking them in péeces one againſt another, vaniſhed out of ſight ſuddenly, and with him the Tower and the Wood likewiſe, ſo that <hi>Arguto</hi> and the eleuen Ladies, found themſelues at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in a large ſpacious Fielde. There found he the aged Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gromancer, and <hi>Primaleon,</hi> calling vnto him with a loude voyce, and the Lady knowing her old angry Father, durſt not approche néere him, fearing leaſt he would againe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe her in the enchauntment, as hauing already taſted his cruell ſeueritie.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Arguto</hi> ſecuring her, went chéerefully to méet them, when being come together, the aged Father could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare but very louingly embraced his Daughter, the like did <hi>Primaleon</hi> and <hi>Arguto.</hi> So going along with the olde man to his abyding, it drew to Supper time, where ſitting downe at a Table right ſumptuouſly prepared, all the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per while, the olde mans Daughter did nothing elſe, but earneſtly looke vppon the deliuered Knight, and breathed forth many broken ſighes, whereby <hi>Primaleon</hi> and <hi>Arguto</hi> coniectured, that the young Lady was enamoured of the Knight, ſo paſt they the ſupper time in mirthfull talke, and pleaſant diſcourſings.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">Q</seg>Vickly after the Tables were with-drawne, the old man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the Squires to walke aſide, and then turning towarde the Knights, he thus began. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and vertuous Lords, I am vndoubtedly perſwaded, that you repute mee as a cruell &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde Father, beeing bleſſed but with one Daughter onely, I ſhould be ſo tranſported with furie and paſſion, to cenſure her with ſo ſeuere a puniſhment: but if I tell you the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt caſe that euer you heard, I doubt not but your oppinion will bee ſo altered, as you will wonder I ſhould be ſo hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and gentle, in inflicting no heauier a iudgement on her: albeit in the end, each fault ſhould merritoriouſly haue béene doubled on this diſloyall Knight, well woorthy to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure vnconfined torments, ſo long as this ſpacious rounde hath continuance.</p>
               <p>Know then (faire Lords) that this enfranchaſed Knight named <hi>Brunoro,</hi> redéemed by your manly paines and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, was Lorde of a Caſtell ſome ſixe leagues diſtance hence, who being enriched with countleſſe treaſure, would make no ſpare of large and liberall ſummes, to haue at his pleaſure, the faireſt maidens dwelling in theſe parts. Hée hearing that my Daughter was ranckt &amp; reckoned among thoſe of choiſeſt beautie, attempted not by coyne or rich promiſes to win her to his purpoſe, becauſe he well knew,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:14347:246"/>
ſuch courſes were ſillie and very vnſauourie, to preuaile with a Ladie of high blood &amp; reſolution: wherfore he prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed by more facill and tractable meanes, and which much more eaſilier preuaileth with light-headed Damoſels, to wit, patheticall ſpéeches, quick and queintly couched, ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with ſad ſighes, vowes, &amp; diſſembled atteſtations, that he was truly and ſincerely deuoted to her in affection.</p>
               <p>The young virgine, altogether vnacquainted with loues idle dalliances, caſting a raſh inconſiderate eye vpon him, apprehended (ouer-haſtilie) that hee was a man of comlie perſonage, debonaire, well qualitied, rich, and ſo worthie in loue to be reſpected, that ſhe gaue him ſo franck a poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of her hart, as there wanted nothing but apt meanes to conſort herſelfe with him. He perceiuing this too ſuddaine inclination of the Damoſell, purpoſed onely to ſerue his luſtful appetite with her, &amp; then afterward to caſt her off, as he had in like manner dealt by diuers other: and procuring to haue ſecrete conference with her, he compaſt it ſo cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as no eye in my houſe could be guiltie of it. At which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, it was my miſhap, to be farre off from my Country, in ſeruice of the young Soldane of <hi>Babylon,</hi> who gathered together his martiall forces, to reuenge the death of <hi>Albay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer</hi> his Father: by meanes whereof he had the apter oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie, to obtaine of my vnhappy childe <hi>Roſella,</hi> euen what his looſe deſires beſt pleaſed him to vrge. But yet her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion gouernd her thus farre, that before her maiden con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence ſhould forſake her, an honourable promiſe of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage paſt betweene them, to be performed in a Woode ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie neere adioyning, where hee would loially combine the matrimoniall knot, neuer to be diſſolued but by death one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.</p>
               <p>And his alleaged reaſon, why it ſhould be there thus cloſely conſumated, was, becauſe his Parents &amp; Friendes ſhould be no hinderance, to his quiet enioying her in that ſacred eſtate: for (in nobilitie and wealth) he ſomewhat ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeded her, and therefore, (as he ſaid) he was the more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing, to be iniured in this ſollemne determination.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14347:247"/>The ſillie Damoſell, too full of credulitie, ſtretched her well-meaning thoughts no further then his promiſes, and therefore iumpt with <hi>Brunoro,</hi> both for place and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without conceiting, that an honourable mind, which ſhe (till this miſhap) continually carried, would euer giue entertainement to ſuch degenerate baſenes, as his hollow hart right cunningly cloaked. The next night following, without coyne, iewels, or ought elſe of eſtéeme, ſhe ſecretly got foorth at the Garden-gate, where <hi>Brunoro</hi> diligently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waited her comming, and this was done with ſuch warie héed and circumſpection, that not any in my Caſtell did ſo much as ſuſpect it: there did ſhe louingly embrace her <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noro,</hi> and he (the better to couller his vntruth) expreſſed as kinde a welcome to her.</p>
               <p>Away they went to the afore-ſaid Wood, where with kiſſes, coyings, and ſuch like flatteries, but no act at all performed of marriage, he cropt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faireſt flower that beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified her boſome.

<pb n="241" facs="tcp:14347:247"/>
glutted his libidinous and inſatiate deſire, as (almoſt) it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céedeth modeſty to report it.

The next morning after this heauy accident, it was my hap to come home againe, where I found a ſtrange and vncouth confuſion, becauſe my <hi>Roſella</hi> was no where to be heard of.</p>
               <p>Héere-vpon, I betooke my ſelfe preſently to mine Arte, thereby to be reſolued what was become of her, but my ill hap chaunced to be ſuch, that a certaine wizzard among you Chriſtians, had gone beyond me in mine owne experience, and taken the matter out of my hand, ſo that this way I could learne nothing of her. Then ſhaped I my courſe by another progreſſion, &amp; taking two Knights with me, moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted forth-with on horſe-backe, purpoſing by diligent ſearch to finde her againe, riding directly toward <hi>Brunoroes</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtell, becauſe that very day I vnderſtoode, how he had béen often ſéene paſſing to and fro from my dwelling, and by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers meanes had ſaluted my daughter, declaring euident ſignes of loue to her: at which report, my hopes wexing more chéerefull, I was halfe perſwaded to finde her linckt with him in mariage.</p>
               <p>As we rode along through that vnhappy Wood, (the cloſe betrayer both of my daughters ioyes and mine) by what chaunce I know not, we miſtooke our way, and happened into the very thickeſt of all the Wood, where gazing vp and downe for a more eaſie paſſage: my daughter, ſhunning all
<pb facs="tcp:14347:248"/>
places where ſhe might likelieſt be ſéene, had hid her ſelfe behind a thick leafie brake, yet not with ſuch ſkill, but that her ſnow-white ſkinne ſhot a lightſome radiaunce through the twiſted braunches. Now, albeit I little thought what this bright appearance might be, yet the minde (euermore the Augure and preſager of harmes) ſtrooke this harſh diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation on the vntunde ſtrings of my ſoule, that this ſhado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed Alablaſter brightnes was my daughter. And making toward the place, when ſhe perceaued that ſhee could no longer conceale her ſelfe, ſhe came vnto me, veyled before with an apron of thick-wrought leaues, which the ſight of her owne ſhame had inſtructed her to make, and falling ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſiuely vpon her knées, ſpake in this manner. Beholde (deere Father) thy vnfortunate daughter, and kill me not, though (in iuſtice) I haue deſerued no leſſe.</p>
               <p>I (inly toucht with the true ſence both of ſhame &amp; gréefe) was ſo furiouſly tranſported, that neither pitty or patience preuailing againſt rage, I tooke her by the long treſſes of her haire, &amp; lifting her thereby violently from the ground, would with my dagger haue ſtabd her to the heart: but the Knights in my company, forcibly reſtrained me, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailed me like friends, to take her home with me to my Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtell, where (vpon more deliberate conſideration of the caſe) I might further determine of her as I found occaſion. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie thankfully I tooke their kinde aduiſe, becauſe I iudged it an ouer-light puniſhment, to let her eſcape with ſo ſpeedy a diſpatch of life, rather (me thought) the caſe might appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend ſuch merit, that tenne thouſand ſeuere caſtigations would ſéeme inſufficient: wherefore, cloathing her in the garment of my Page, becauſe that was the neereſt and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieſt helpe, I brought her to my Caſtell, where impriſoning her in a remote chamber of my houſe, for two dayes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I gaue her nothing to féede on.</p>
               <p>The two Knights my friendly companions, knowing for certainty, that the death of her would be mine owne di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch alſo, right kindly comming to me, tolde me in graue and ſenſible ſort, how highly it would redound to mine own
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:14347:248"/>
ſhame, when her death ſhould be reported to happen, by my meanes, &amp; the nature of her offence neuer heard or known. They hauing certaine precious confectious about them, and wine of rich and ſoueraigne power, by my conſent went to her chamber, where firſt cheriſhing her faintnes with thoſe neceſſary helpes, and addition of apparant likelihoode, that my grace and fauour might againe be recouered: they won from her the ſum of all, both by what meanes ſhe came into the Wood, and how (in that ſort) ſhe was left there naked, which they perceauing, to happen onely through fond loues ſimplicity, returned againe to me, and tolde me the whole ſtorie of my daughters miſ-fortune.</p>
               <p>Then grew I incenſed againſt this trothleſſe man, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming my kindled rage (ſomewhat) toward my daughter, conſidering, that a young Ladies firſt offence, ſhould not be ſo ſeuerely chaſtiſed, eſpecially when earneſtly one was the cauſe of her treſpaſſe: where-vpon I faithfully promiſed the Knights, that I would not procéede in any further ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour againſt her. But ſitting all alone by my ſelfe, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to practiſe, how I might be ſufficiently reuenged on the Knight, by whoſe villanie I was ſo hainouſly iniuried, and making many plat-formes in my braine, thus I concluded: that <hi>Roſella</hi> (by writing) ſhould certifie <hi>Brunoro,</hi> howe I lay ſicke at the point of death, ſo that if he would then come to her, he ſhould enioy my money and goods, and likewiſe be poſſeſſour of all my bookes, whereof (a long while) he had béene very deſirous, and offered large ſummes of money to haue them: as for his leauing her ſo vnkindly naked, in the depth of her loue ſhe had buried that blame, &amp; by no meanes tooke it as any fact of his, but rather of ſome ſlauiſh vnciuill ſeruant, who vpon a malicious inclination toward her, had (contrary to his knowledge) ſo miſ-entreated her, and hee (no doubt) in great heauines for lack of her company.</p>
               <p>My purpoſe heerein was, that (vppon his comming) I might be poſſeſt of him, and afterward to vſe him as I ſaw occaſion: ſo, with a Letter or tranſcript drawne to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, I entred into my daughters chamber, where giuing
<pb facs="tcp:14347:249"/>
her good lookes, and taking her by the hand, thus I began. Although the iniurie I haue receaued by thée, hath made a large paſſage thorow my hart: yet am I willing to forgiue and forget it, ſo thou wilt pleaſure me but in one only mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which ſhall yeelde contentment both to thée and mee. I will doe (quoth ſhe) whatſoeuer it ſhall pleaſe you to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, in recompence of the great grace I receaue from you ſo vnworthily.</p>
               <p>My will is, quoth I, that thou write this Letter vnto <hi>Brunoro:</hi> and there-vpon I gaue it her to reade. The ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low witted Girle, whoſe doating affection would not let her looke into the vnrepairable wrong ſhee had receaued by <hi>Brunoro,</hi> ſuddainly thus replied. Oh God forbid (déere fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) that I ſhould prooue ſuch a traytreſſe to him, whom (more then mine owne ſoule) I loue and eſtéeme: and no ſooner had ſhe thus ſaide, but ſuddainly would haue caſt her ſelfe out at the caſement of her window, becauſe ſhe would not be guilty of writing ſuch a Letter.</p>
               <p>I, who knew too well her firme reſolution, immediatly became ſo furiouſly diſcontented, as had not the Knights ſtept in ſuddainly vpon me, queſtionleſſe ſhe had there peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by my hand: but beeing by them with-helde from my purpoſe, I tolde them the wilfull folly of the wench, and how fooliſh loue quite blinded her iudgement, and made her ſtill doat on him that had ſo vilely abuſed her. The Knights ſpent ſome little while, in perſwading me to more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, becauſe ſhee had confidently aunſwered, that ſhee woulde endure all tormentes whatſoeuer, rather then bee wone to betray <hi>Brunoro:</hi> and they well noting her ſetled purpoſe, held it neceſſary, that ſhee ſhould haue her minde, I to pardon her, cloathe her againe in her owne habite, and let her goe at liberty, but with a farre ſtricter eye of care of her, then before had béene vſed. All which I yéelded to, and ſhe (as impiercible as the diamond) could be drawne to no other beléefe, but that <hi>Brunoro</hi> right déerely affected her, whereon ſhe compaſt the meanes, to acquaint him with my determination, writing vnto him what I had entended:
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:14347:249"/>
and (which was moſt to my preiudice,) that my Art failed me, and could at this inſtant doo me no ſeruice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brunoro,</hi> being (at that time) the very arroganteſt Knight in all this Countrey, grew proude and diſdainfull againſt me, and hearing that I practiſed his death, did not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the like by me, but how to bring me into a moſt wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched condition of life: and perceauing it was publiquely bruted abroad, what wrong he had done to me &amp; my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he deuiſed with him ſelfe, to lay a freſh affliction on me, and (by trayning her once againe from my houſe) to abuſe her more villainouſly then hee had done before: neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring, that ſo rare loue and fidelity in a woman, deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to be matcht with the greateſt Prince in the worlde. Vpon this vile determination both againſt her and me, hee wrote to <hi>Roſella,</hi> that the third night following hee would come and confer with her in the garden, and at the appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted houre, the vnfortunate Damoſell perceauing him there, went ſimply to him, where taking her vp againe behinde him on his Horſe, vnſéene of any one, he caried her away. They had not ridden aboue two leagues, but (like a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning traytour) faigning that hee would make amendes for his paſſed diſcourteſie, he cauſed her to diſmount: then gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing her counterfaited kinde kiſſes and embraces, and glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his luſt againe with her diſhonour, his brutiſh heate was no ſooner alayed, but then he manifeſted his damnable purpoſe, and dragging her along by the haire of the head, ſayd, that he purpoſed there to kill her.</p>
               <p>Shée (ſilly ſoule) ruing too late her fond credulity, entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him (for Gods ſake) to ſpare her life, whereto he yéelded on this condition, that ſhe would procure his entraunce in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my Caſtell, and make him Lord of all that was mine. The miſerable Lady, not knowing how otherwiſe to ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome her life, made him promiſe to performe it, and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with him back to my Caſtell, with thirty attendants all well prouided: through the Garden ſhe conducted them into my great Hall, where making their paſſage forward with engines of yron, the noyſe quickly awaking me, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb facs="tcp:14347:250"/>
conceited who they were, and ſtepping immediatly into my ſtudy, I found, that a Chriſtian wizzard, called the <hi>Sage Aliarte of the obſcure valley,</hi> had all this while béene the hinderer of my Magick ſpelles, but hauing done what him pleaſed, I was now againe at liberty.</p>
               <p>Héere-vpon, out of my chamber window I threw a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine powder, which ſmote <hi>Brunoro</hi> blinde, &amp; all that were with him, ſo that except I pleaſed to releaſe them, they could neuer haue the benefit of ſight any more. Then ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping downe my ſelfe among them, in a diſſembled voyce I tolde them how eaſily they might come by my treaſure, and opening a doore fit for my purpoſe, I ſayde: Followe mee Gentlemen, and I will make you all rich for euer, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring where I bad them, were all by me lockt vp in a cloſe priſon, but my daughter I conuayed to her former place of reſtraint.</p>
               <p>Early the next morning, I ſent for my friends, the two fore-remembred Knights, ſhewing them howe well I had hunted, and what a booty I had caught, yet neuer iſſued forth of my Caſtell: whereat a while they ſtood ſomewhat ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, but moſt of all, at the mad and inconſiderate loue, which my daughter ſtill bare to ſo falſe a tretcher. I vrged their aduiſe, whether thus blinde they ſhould die there in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or haue their heads ſmitten off for ſo manifeſt villanie. The Knights ſtudying how to ſaue <hi>Roſellaes</hi> life, in regard of her wonderfull error in loue, after ſome little conference had together, one of them thus ſpake. In our opinion Sir, you ſhould not put them to death thus blinde in priſon, for wanting the ſight of their owne miſery, they ſhall alſo giue no example, of ſo monſtrous an ingratitude toward a true louing Lady: beſide, they ſhould not eſcape with loſſe of their heads onely, becauſe a fault of ſuch great quality, iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie deſerues an aunſwerable puniſhment. Wee rather déeme it more conuenient, that (diſcharging all the reſt) you enchaunt <hi>Brunoro</hi> and your daughter in two ſeuerall pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, with ſuch varietie of chaſtiſements inflicted vpon them, as ſhould neuer ceaſe or they be frée from, till two of the
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:14347:250"/>
beſt Knights in the worlde wrought theyr deliueraunce. This ſentence pleaſed me excéedingly, ſo that ſetting all the reſt at liberty, I cauſed <hi>Brunoro</hi> to be brought bound before me, where reſtoring his ſight againe, and reproouing his baſe ingratitude to ſo loyall a Lady, I adiudged him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine within the Tower, vntill ſuch a Knight ſhould come to redéeme him, and there ſhould he continually be hunted by two ſhée Beares, and my ſelfe (to féede mine eyes ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently with his affliction) enchaunted my owne abiding in the ſame Tower, where you my Lord <hi>Primaleon</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to finde me.</p>
               <p>My daughters doome was within the Wood, where ſhee loſt the bright beauty of her virgine honour, there ſhould a murderous villaine daily cut her throate, and afterward ſhe was to liue in the vncouered Tower, feeding onely vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the bounty of the ayre, aunſwerable to her miſerie in the Wood, where ſhe was rauiſhed and left ſo inhumanely naked.</p>
               <p>At theſe words he began to looke about him, and percea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing it wexed late, hee would not trouble them with anie further diſcourſe: ſo the Knights prepared to take their reſt, with intent to pacifie this diſcontentment, and procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the olde man to be more friendly to the Knight <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noro.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Brunoro,</hi> who (by this long time of chaſtiſement) had alayed his proud ſtomack, ſayde. That it was in vaine for him to offer any ſuch attonement, when her diſcontented Father would no way be wonne thereto. Then the two Knights tooke the olde man betwéene them, ſhewing him, how hee might (in one inſtant) make firme his daughters loſt honour and his owne, by graunting to a conuenable marriage betwéene her and <hi>Brunoro,</hi> who had now enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a more milde and obedient ſpirit, and by the feeling ſence of his paſſed miſeries, had hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled his proud thoughts to a more gentle temper.</p>
               <p>The aged Magitian, confidently crediting what they ſaid, and that they would not report it, except it were ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, was contented to giue his daughter in marriage to
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:14347:251"/>
                  <hi>Brunoro:</hi> but firſt he deſired to ſee ſome proofe of him, for the better clearing of all doubtes to come, where-with the Knights could finde no miſlike, wherefore they called him before the olde man, and thus <hi>Primaleon</hi> ſpake in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of <hi>Roſella.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brunoro,</hi> this auncient Lord is very well pleaſed, that this faithfull Lady his daughter ſhall be your wife: proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded you doo vndertake ſome glorious enterpriſe, which may wipe out the ſcandale of your paſſed offences. I will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme (quoth <hi>Brunoro</hi>) what ſoeuer it ſhall pleaſe him or you to commaund me, although I were aſſured to looſe my life, which truely (in iuſtice) I haue woorthily deſerued. This aunſwere was of ſuch powerfull efficacie, that the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Magitian (as one ſufficiently perſwaded already) would haue him to aduenture on no further perill, but <hi>Brunoro,</hi> to let the Knights ſée his forwardnes and valour, would néeds performe what he had intended.</p>
               <p>When he was armed and mounted on horſe-backe, <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maleon,</hi> loth to make any longer aboade there, cauſed him to be called, when, to the good liking of the aged man, but much more of <hi>Roſella,</hi> they aſcended the ſtaires, and <hi>Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon,</hi> holding the Lady by one hand, and <hi>Brunoro</hi> by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, crauing fauour of the Magitian, began as followeth. Your preſent behauiour Sir <hi>Brunoro,</hi> with no doubt of your after progreſſion in all honour, hath made <hi>Roſellaes</hi> father to forget all former diſlikes, &amp; giues you his deareſt daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as your wife, with abſolute promiſe, that after his death, his wealth and poſſeſſions remaine wholy yours, as a dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in mariage with his beloued child. Then cauſing a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Prieſt to bee called, which liued ſecretly among ſome fewe Chriſtians in that Countrey, he prayed the olde man, that <hi>Roſella</hi> and <hi>Brunoro</hi> might be baptized as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, according as he promiſed him, when he brought him forth of the Tower.</p>
               <p>The Nigromancer beeing ſomewhat obſtinate in his owne errour, would gladly haue denied it, but not daring to contradict <hi>Primaleon</hi> in any thing, expreſſed an outward
<pb facs="tcp:14347:252"/>
willingnes: ſo being baptized, they were then eſpouſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and ſollemne feaſting was there performed, ſuch as the time and place could affoord.</p>
               <p>When our Knights had remained there two whole daies, they called the old Magitian aſide, and demaunded of him a plaine information, concerning the procéedings of <hi>Albayzars</hi> ſonne, that they might the better prouide for any harme to enſue. Of him they vnderſtood, how this Prince had ſtird vp the Soldane of <hi>Perſia,</hi> ſonne to him that dyed before <hi>Constantinople,</hi> with the Kings of <hi>Tartaria</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia,</hi> the Emperour of <hi>Trebiſonde,</hi> and other Princes, with them alſo was a younger Brother of <hi>Riſtoranoes.</hi> The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why hee gathered ſuch a puiſſant ſtrength together, was, to be poſſeſſed of ſo many of the beſt Chriſtian Knights as he could come by, not to put them to death, but as hoping to draw them to his blind ſect and error, or at leaſt ſo to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, that they might not beare any armes againſt him: for the young Soldane was of ſuch a generous ſpirit, as hee would not reuenge his Fathers death on any man, that by deceipt ſhould fall into his power, but openly &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably in a pitcht field of battaile.</p>
               <p>The Knights being thus farre acquainted with the caſe, tooke their leaue of the old Wizzard, <hi>Brunoro</hi> and <hi>Roſella,</hi> as if they went for <hi>Constantinople,</hi> not reuealing their cloſe purpoſe to viſite <hi>Babylon,</hi> yet did the Magitian plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it, that their determination was abſolutely thether, wherefore when they were gone, hee went to his ſtudie, doubting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Primaleon</hi> (by the muttering &amp; priuie whiſpering which he perceiued to be among the people,) iudged verily, that this was ſome valiant Pagane, and ſéeing his owne ſillie Iade, by reaſon of his running ſo many courſes, to be very weake and almoſt vtterly tyred, ſent this meſſage to <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuto:</hi> that if he would haue the honour of vnhorſing him, he ſhould not preſume on ſo apparant an aduantage, but commaund him a better horſe, more apt for the encounter, to the end (he being a Stranger there) if he had the fal, yet he might not lay the blame on his horſe. <hi>Corcuto,</hi> hearing a demaund ſo reaſonable, preſently ſent him a gallant Courſer, right richly capariſond, whereon <hi>Primaleon</hi> luſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie mounting, trotted him brauely to his place, and mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him ſo loftilie at the ſounde of the Trumpets, that the <hi>Babylonians</hi> at the ſight thereof, beganne to miſtruſt theyr owne partaker.</p>
               <p>The encounter betwéene them was with terrible fury, expreſſing dreadleſſe ſpirits in both the Champions, <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuto</hi> looſing one of his ſtirrops, but recouering it very quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againe, and <hi>Primaleon</hi> glentring a little aſide, but ſate vpright immediatly on it.

                  <hi>Primaleon,</hi> leaſt as a tryumpher he ſhould be conducted to the Pallace, ſhruncke ſuddenly away among the croude, and went to his lodging, where being vnarmed, his friend and he fell to pleaſant conference. <hi>Corcuto</hi> being perfectly recouered, and feigning to haue béen abſent about ſome vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent buſines, came downe into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great Hall, where he fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d his Barons and diuers ſtrange Kings, who hauing ſéene the ſport to end, with the fall of the Pagane Knight that

               <p>
                  <hi>Corcuto,</hi> not a little iocond at this good happe, gaue the Hoſt what was promiſed by Proclamation, and conſulting of this matter among his Barons, the concluſion was this, that certaine Spies ſhould be ſent thether, and finding him to be a Chriſtian, immediatly to ſurprize him, thereby to weaken the glory of the Chriſtian Court, but beeing a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racen, then highly to honour him, and giue him the rich prizes ordained for the tournament. Election was made of ſuch men to be ſent thether, as had béene diuers time at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and other places of great concourſe in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome, among whom was a wealthy Merchant, that had often ſold Iewels to the Empreſſe <hi>Grydonia,</hi> and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to the Princeſſe <hi>Miragarda,</hi> by meanes whereof, he had diuers times ſéene both <hi>Primaleon</hi> and <hi>Arguto:</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring them very perfectly, hee quickly returned to the Soldane and tolde him: that theſe were two of the moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed Knights among the Chriſtians, and making ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zure on them, he might the eaſier reuenge his iniuries ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained. <hi>Corcuto</hi> calling the Kinges and Barons to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, ſhewed them what a good beginning had happened to theyr proceedings, whereby they might the more aſſuredly perſwade themſelues of victorie: and among the diuerſitie
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:14347:254"/>
of oppinions, it was thus determined, that they ſhould be peaceably taken, to returne in exchange for ſome of them, if any ſhould happen to be taken as priſoners, becauſe there were many other worthy Knights in the Chriſtian band, at whoſe hands they expected ſcarce kinde entertainment. This being reſolued on, <hi>Corcuto</hi> gaue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Hoſte in charge, to ſerue them at Supper with a commixed Wine, purpoſelie prepared to cauſe heauineſſe of ſleepe, ſo to be poſſeſſed of them without any furder danger: which beeing according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put in execution, in the night time they were taken and ſtrongly bound, without any further knowledge in the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>
               <p>On the next morrow, when they ſawe themſelues thus taken priſoners, they made vndoubted account to looſe their liues: but when they were brought before <hi>Corcuto,</hi> who (with a chéerfull countenaunce) embraced <hi>Primaleon,</hi> their hopes were ſome-what better reuiued, and <hi>Corcuto,</hi> being of a very honorable reſpectiue nature, ſpake to them in this manner. Albeit I haue iuſt reaſon to hate you, as the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to my blood and fayth, yet am I not any way cruellie enclined toward yée: wherefore let me tell yée, that you muſt remaine with mee, ſo long as I thinke it conuenient, and you ſhall be ſerued as in your owne Chriſtian King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, wanting nothing elſe, but libertie of departing hence at your owne pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Our Knights, who lookt for far worſe entertainement, right humbly thanked him for this royall kindnes: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon they were diſcharged of their bands, and permitted to walke about the Cittie and Pallace, but alwayes with a good guarde attending on them, whereby theyr hopes grew deſperate of euer parting thence.</p>
               <p>Now come we to the aged Nigromancer againe, who (as hath béene already declared) had a daily reſpect to what they did, as fearing leaſt ſome diſaſter might befall them, when he found by his Arte that they were impriſoned: hée preſently purpoſed to ſet them at libertie, in reſpect of the honourable benefit, which he had receiued onely by them,
<pb facs="tcp:14347:255"/>
but yet hee intended to doe it ſo ſecretly, that the Soldane ſhould not at any time impute it to him, ſo, without impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his purpoſe to his Daughter, nor yet to his Sonne in Law, hauing prepared two excellent Armours, and two gallant Courſers, he departed toward <hi>Babylon.</hi> There hee arriued at the inſtant time, when <hi>Albayzars</hi> ſonne the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dane of <hi>Babylon,</hi> had ſecretly determined the death of our Knights, in reuenge of his Fathers death among the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, beeing thereto prouoked by the importunitie of his Barons, which greatly repined at the fauour hee ſhewed them, and therefore, though they had wone him to it, yet they meant to performe it when he leaſt dreampt of it.</p>
               <p>The Magitian perceiuing their imminent perrill, that very night entred into the Cittie, and going to the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber where they were ſafely guarded, hee awaked them out of a very ſound ſléepe, &amp; making himſelfe knowne to them, told all the treaſon intended againſt them: then gaue hee them a certaine roote, where-with rubbing theyr faces, they ſhould be altered in ſo ſtrange a maner, as no man poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly could haue knowledge of them. Then did he appoynt a place for their meeting, where he would prouide them of horſe and Armour, and afterward guide them til they were in ſound aſſurance: they thankfull for ſo great a courteſie, and loth to be murdered there ſo inhumanely, made vſe of this good hap in ſuch an vrgent neceſſitie.</p>
               <p>The Magitian beeing gone very early in the morning, <hi>Primaleon</hi> and <hi>Arguto</hi> feigning an accuſtomed ſléeping, much longer then before they had beene wont to doe, ſéeing the Guard and ſeruaunts with-drawne to theyr breakefaſt, put on nothing but theyr ſhirts, and cullouring theyr faces with the roote, they became all black as any Negro, which changing them ſtrangely from their former appearance, they wondred at one another, and aſſured themſelues that no man could know the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: So paſſed they out of their cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and by the Guard, being taken by them verily for <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> whereof there vſed many to the houſe, that attended on the ſtrange Kings then there being.</p>

                  <pb n="249" facs="tcp:14347:255"/>In this ſort paſſed they by the Pallace gate, and walked vnſuſpected forth at the Citty port, reputed ſtill to be <hi>Indian</hi> noble men, and ſuch as were alied to thoſe black Princes. Being come to the place aſſigned by the Nigromancer, he was right ioyfull of their ſo ſafe eſcape, and waſhing them with a water which hee had brought for the purpoſe, their countenances receaued their true complexion. When they were armed, and had thanked the Magitian for his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full kindnes, with promiſe neuer to forget ſo great a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit: they rode on a while together, and when they were far enough from the Citty, he tooke his farewell of them, and they rode away as beſt them ſelues pleaſed: leauing no lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle noiſe and diſquiet in the Citty, when it was known that the two Chriſtian Knights were eſcaped, and no man could imagine how or in what manner, or whom to holde guilty of their cloſe departure.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:14347:256"/>
in affection, and intirely loued the faire Lady <hi>Candida,</hi> yet to keepe his honour from noted touch thereof, hee couerd it very cunningly, and ſeeing that his ſonne muſt néedes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy her in mariage, to croſſe the match, and compaſſe his owne hopes in after time, hee practiſed how to hinder their proceeding.</p>
               <p>The Emperour <hi>Primaleon</hi> in like manner, without any regard of his age and imbecilities, hee was alſo ouercome with ſuch amorous paſſions, and ſo enflamed with loue to <hi>Candida,</hi> that it was hell to him to heare talke of her mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age: but <hi>Leonato</hi> and <hi>Tarnaes,</hi> relying wholy on <hi>Palmerins</hi> promiſe, were the bolder to breake their minds to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, finding him accompanied with <hi>Florendos</hi> and the wizzard <hi>Aliarte,</hi> who likewiſe made loue to the ſame <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dida.</hi> By the Emperours aunſweres it plainly appeared, that he was not willing ſhe ſhould be ſo maried, but ſaid, he had purpoſed in his priuate thoughts, to beſtow her on <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanto</hi> young <hi>Primaleons</hi> brother, which he vrged the rather, becauſe <hi>Oliuanto</hi> was not at that preſent in the Court, ſo the more ſurely to deferre off the mariage: but <hi>Leonatoes</hi> reſolution continued in ſuch ſort, as the Emperour (not knowing eaſily howe to get him out of <hi>Constantinople</hi>) was enforced to ſay, that it was not meete time to marry ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie a Lady, without performance of ſome higher attempts for her ſake, then (as yet) he or any elſe had vnder-taken. When <hi>Leonato</hi> ſaw his hopes fruſtrated with ſuch peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie ſpeeches, he ſtept boldly before the Emperour, ſaying. Since I ſee your highneſſe is my onely hinderer, in the long expected felicity of my deſires, which (but for you) I might now freely enioy: were you as other men are, I would then tell yée, that age will not let you performe the office of a Knight, and I will maintaine, againſt him whoſoeuer dare combate in your cauſe, that you doo me moſt vnkingly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Palmerin</hi> hearing theſe proud ſpéeches of his ſonne, ſtept forth, and checkt him with a ſharpe reprehenſion, for being ſo careleſſe of his duty: but <hi>Leonato,</hi> ſcorning to be baffuld
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:14347:256"/>
by any man in his loue, or that the greateſt Monarch on the earth ſhould intercept his deſſeignes, drewe foorth his ſword, ſaying. Whoſoeuer dare denie, that beautious <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dida</hi> ſhall not be my wife, let him come forth of <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> there (like a Knight) will I expect him, and there let him try, whether I be worthy of her or no.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Palmerin</hi> called preſently for his armour, to defend (as he ſaide) the honour of the Emperour, but indeede hee rather ſought to diſappoint his ſonne, and compaſſe the meanes of his owne fond deſires. The Emperour, who was not wont to beare ſuch an iniurie, cauſed his Armes to be brought, with intent to aduenture the combate with his Nephew: but <hi>Aliarte,</hi> as forwarde in affection to <hi>Candida</hi> as any of them, albeit he gouernd it with greater modeſty, falling on his knée before the Emperour, tolde him, that he ought by no meanes, to hazard his perſon in fight againſt <hi>Leonato,</hi> becauſe to whatſoeuer iſſue the combate ſorted, he could not but repent it: beſide, he would neuer preſume ſo raſhly on ſuch an enterpriſe, but that in generall opinion it would paſſe for currant, that he was growne amorous of the faire young Lady, which would be a great diſgrace to his reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend yeeres.</p>
               <p>When the Emperour found his gréefe toucht, where it pained him indeede, he ſtayed his haſtines, yet to ſhew that he was mooude with the zeale of his owne honour, he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to baniſh <hi>Leonato</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Constantinople,</hi> holding it as great grace, in that hee proceeded with no other ſeueritie againſt him: yet he determined within a while to repeale his ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, vpon ſome earneſt entreatie of his father <hi>Palme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin,</hi> who verily entended nothing leſſe, or declared himſelfe offended a iote at his ſonnes exile, but rather was highly contented there-with, hoping by meanes of his abſence, the eaſier to proceede in his amourous purpoſe.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Leonato</hi> heard that the Emperour had baniſhed him, he cloſely went to the lodging of the Princeſſe <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narda,</hi> where he thought him ſelfe ſafe, albeit the Emperour ſhould vnderſtand of his being there: and ſuch ſpeeches paſt

betwéene him and his mother, (who already was iealous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of her huſband,) that ſhee hauing ſent for <hi>Candida</hi> into her chamber, fell into queſtioning with her concerning <hi>Leonato,</hi> onely to heare how ſhe ſtoode affected toward him, he ſtanding cloſe hid all the while behind the Arras.</p>
               <p>The young Lady being in his mothers preſence, whom in her ſoule ſhe moſt intirely loued, ſtood not on nice termes or coying ceremonies, but plainly declared, that none but <hi>Leonato</hi> was Lord of her deſires, him had ſhe elected as her harts beſt choiſe, albeit her hopes ſtoode nowe on deſperate hazards, deliuering no likelyhoode that ſhe ſhould euer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy him, becauſe the Emperour had pronounced his baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, euen at the inſtant when their mariage ſhould haue béene confirmed. <hi>Polynarda</hi> ſeeing the Lady ſo firmely min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and that in ſuch diſcréete modeſt manner, ſhe had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted her true affection toward her ſonne <hi>Leonato,</hi> ſhe ſaid. Swéete Lady, if I worke the meanes that <hi>Leonato</hi> ſhall be your huſband, and him ſelfe as ready as you to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh it, tell me (faire ſoule) what will ye ſay then? When <hi>Candida</hi> heard the Princeſſe vſe theſe ſpéeches, a flood of ioying teares ſtreamed downe her faire chéekes, and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently taking the Princeſſe by the hand, ſpake in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. I know that your highneſſe, beeing ſo néere allyed to my Lord the Emperour, will not determine any thing, that ſhall returne to my blame or diſparagement: therefore (if it pleaſe you) I will aſſure my ſelfe in your preſence to my Lord <hi>Leonato</hi> your ſonne, and confeſſe my ſelfe to be his troth-plighted wife, committing all my for<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

My noble Lord, doo not ſo much wrong your worth and reputation, that I being your
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:14347:257"/>
humble and obedient ſpouſe, you ſhould thus humiliate your ſelfe to me: riſe therefore I beſeech you, and doo as your princely mother ſhall aduiſe yée.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Polynarda</hi> ſeeing matters in ſo good a forwardnes, ſayde. Since you hold both one ſolemne purpoſe, and that I haue no doubt of my ſonne, but his behauiour ſhall be as become a loyall Knight: by your hands plight your harts in a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious contract, and afterward we will take order for other kinde of proceeding. So ioyned they hand and harts mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally together, nothing wanting but the ceremonie of the Church to confirme them. Such was <hi>Leonatoes</hi> ioy for this high good hap, that ſpeaking ſomewhat louder then nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, he was ouer-heard by one of his fathers followers, who preſently aduertiſed his Lord therof: which <hi>Polynarda</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing, ſhifted <hi>Leonato</hi> away, into the lodging of <hi>Lucilla</hi> her wayting Gentlewoman, and kept him there ſo cloſely, that <hi>Palmerin</hi> ſuppoſed he was gone on his baniſhment.</p>
               <p>But matters falling out beyonde expectation, and that <hi>Leonato</hi> might no longer (with ſafety) abide in <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople:</hi> he ſo ordered the caſe with his Lady <hi>Candida,</hi> as ſhe ſhould goe thence with him into <hi>England,</hi> whereto he found her very tractable. And preparing all thinges for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, without acquainting his mother <hi>Polynarda</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, one night, when <hi>Candida</hi> ſhould haue betaken her ſelfe to reſt, commaunding her wayting Damoſels to bed, ſhe attired her ſelfe like a comly young Gentleman, and in the company of an Engliſh Squire, who was moſt loyall and firme to <hi>Leonato:</hi> they cloſely eſcaped vnſeene out of the Emperours Pallace, going to the place where her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band attended her, and with like ſafety they paſt forth of the Citty, ſhaping their courſe directly for <hi>England,</hi> where on their iourney we will leaue them, till time ſerue more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily to report, what miſhappes they endured vpon the way.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Lorian,</hi> who (as you haue heard already) came with <hi>Victoria</hi> to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> not ſuffering him ſelfe to be ſeene by the Emperour or any other: returned towarde <hi>Turkie,</hi> reſolued to trauaile to the Adamant Caſtell, and hauing ſailed very proſperouſly, within few dayes he arriued at <hi>Tubante,</hi> where <hi>Targiana</hi> welcomde him with ſuch ſincere loue, as he could not but make moſt choiſe account of her.</p>
               <p>Hauing aboade ſome fewe dayes with her, tidings came thether, that <hi>Corcuto</hi> intended his firſt expedition againſt her, as gréeuing that his mother had ſo forſaken him, and maried the man that ſlew his father: ſo that to make proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for this purpoſed inuaſion, a proclamation was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſent abroade, that all thoſe Turkes, who were wont to giue attendance on the great Turkes perſon, for vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall maintenance of the ſtate, ſhould make their repaire to <hi>Tubante,</hi> where they ſhould receaue directions for their fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeruice.

<pb n="252" facs="tcp:14347:258"/>
Letters were directed to <hi>Blandidon</hi> Souldane of <hi>Niquea,</hi> to be readily prepared, for the aſſiſtaunce of <hi>Targiana</hi> when neede required.</p>
               <p>All thinges thus ſetled in very good ſort, <hi>Florian</hi> tooke a kinde farewell of his wife, and trauailed toward the Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant Caſtell, where he had arriued in leſſe then ten dayes: but that <hi>Druſa Velonna,</hi> who (by ouer-much kindnes and humanity, daily vſed toward her by the Emperour, in hope to reclaime her ſtubborne nature) ſuddainly got away from <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and thwarted <hi>Florian</hi> in his purpoſe. For ſhe appearing to him in the likenes of a Light-horſe-man, and beeing demaunded by <hi>Florian</hi> for the way, which ſooneſt would conduct him to the Adamant Caſtell: ſhée told him, that hee ſhould followe the path vpon his left hand, which within two dayes would bring him thether, ſo bidding him adiew, ſhee tooke the right hand way, and rode away from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Florian</hi> giuing credite to the horſe-mans words, did as he was directed, and hauing ridden till about mid-noone, hee happened vpon a Fountaine of very black water, and about it were tyed in chaines two Beares and foure Lyons, ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to be as guardians thereof, that no man ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to taſt of the water. In the midſt of the water ſtoode a Collomne of red ſtone, and vppon it a figure of meruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous blacke Marble, hauing a breefe on it, containing theſe words.</p>
               <q>

               <p>
                  <hi>Florian</hi> hauing read this threatning inſcription, ſmiling thereat, procéeded onward, and his paſſage being through the midſt of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lyons, they all foure roſe vp furiouſly againſt him, and becauſe the chaines where-with they were tyed, gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ouer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>large ſcope, they were all vpon him at once: yet did <hi>Florian</hi> wound the two firſt that came before him, and the reſt ſtoode ſo ſtoutly to him, as being all vp reared on their hinder feete, they gript him terribly about the hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,
<pb facs="tcp:14347:259"/>
and graſpt him ſo ſtrongly in diuers parts of his body, as he could by no meanes get looſe from them. Then they which had felt the kéene edge of his weapon, aſſayled him againe, but ſomewhat more fearfully, and hauing got him ſelfe frée from the other, hee ſet the ſtoutlier againſt the wounded beaſts, which gladly drew back to their ſeuerall places, where-vpon, oppoſing his valour to the other reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, his blowes flew ſo thick euery way about them, that the beaſts (albeit they were moſt wilde and furious) helde deſpairingly off, and durſt not come néere him, by meanes wherof he came the cloſer to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fountaine. But the Beares, whoſe office (as it ſéemed) was the guardance of the water, when <hi>Florian</hi> had attained ſo néere within their reach, that they might worke their malice againſt him: they ſtoode vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right ſo fiercely againſt him, as <hi>Florian</hi> began to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what abaſhed thereat, but checking his thoughts preſently for ſo weake an humour, he made couragiouſly many ſtout ſtrokes at them, and had they not béene by Art enchaunted, they could not haue endured againſt his leaſt blow.</p>
               <p>Hee wexing weary with ſo much labour ſpent in vaine, and almoſt driuen quite out of breath, the Beares hauing likewiſe in diuers places diſarmde him, ſo as he might wel thinke he had no eaſie taſke in hand, when his minde had halfe perſwaded him, that there might be ſome other means then by this ſworde, to compaſſe the height of this daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous enterpriſe: he ſuddenly layd hold on the chayne wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they were tyed, and puld at it with ſuch ſtrength, that the knot of the chaine (beeing faſtened onely by a ryding wier, which would ſlip vp and downe, according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> force applyed againſt it) ranne cloſe to the Beares throates, and they béeing well neere ſtrangled thereby, made many light bounds and mountings aloft, onely to be rid of ſo mightie an oppreſſion.</p>
               <p>But the Knight, reſoluing either on death or victorie, maintayned his pulling with the greater violence, till they were able to breathe no longer, and then the chayne brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, they ranne away ſpéedily into a Wood neere adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:14347:259"/>
and the kingly Lyons, ſeeing the Beares ſkud away in ſuch ſort, began to expreſſe apparant ſignes of gladneſſe, as if they had beene poſſeſt of humaine intellection. So that now he might ſafely goe neerer the water, and taking off his Helmet to drinke therein, he perceiued the water to be wondrous blacke, which made him a little to deliberate thereon: but to ſhew himſelfe not fearefull thereof, lifting his Helmet vp to drinke of the water, hee ſuddenly heard a voyce, crying aloude to him in this manner.</p>
               <q>Drinke not Sir Knight, for if thou doost, thou diest.</q>
               <p>At this voyce, <hi>Florian</hi> turned himſelfe about, as ſéeming to haue ſome knowledge thereof, &amp; perceiued it was <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rina,</hi> who came running toward him very ſwiftly, &amp; ſtaying his purpoſe till ſhee was come to him, hee then thus ſpake. You haue doone well (faire Ladie <hi>Dorina</hi>) in fore-warning me of ſo great a perrill, although ſuch gentlenes hath béene by mee but vnkindly requited: but blame y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enchauntment of the Ring, which tooke from mee the freedome of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when (for my loue) you receiued that wound, which appeares as yet not perfectly healed.</p>
               <p>Forbeare ſuch talke at this time, quoth <hi>Dorina,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for your preſent going to the Adamant Caſtell, which <hi>Druſa Velonna</hi> cauſed her deuils to make in the night, cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it out of an Adamant Mountaine in ſuch ſtrange man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that the ſide toward the Eaſt, drawes all kind of yron to it, but then the Weſt ſide parts againe with it: So that either you muſt purpoſe to abide there for euer, or elſe goe thether without your Armour, and what can any Knight performe without his Armour, eſpecially where Armes muſt be his beſt defence? But I haue found out a helpe for this hinderance, you ſhall couer your Armour with a boyld Harts ſkinne, and ſo the vertue of the Adamant, ſhall not be able to attract or pierce it, for the reſt I referre it to your manly valour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Florian</hi> thus aduiſed, tooke his leaue of <hi>Dorina,</hi> and rode away with no meane haſt, fearing leaſt ſome other ſhould

chaunce thether before him, and ſet frée the young Ladie: then returning the way againe, which <hi>Druſa Velonna</hi> had falſely directed, hee rode according to <hi>Dorinaes</hi> appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and hauing ridden a whole day, about ſunne-ſetting he came to a part of that Countrey, where he vnderſtoode, how y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Adamant Caſtel was within leſſe then fiue leagues.

ſted of thine, I muſt deliuer her the head of the faire young Lady <hi>Argentina,</hi> and thou ſhalt likewiſe die at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſelfe ſame inſtant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Florian</hi> ſmiling at his fooliſh ſpéeches, ſaid. Returne (good father) to thy Lady, and tell her I haue but one poore head, which I cannot part withall vpon ſo eaſie an iniunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: bid her rather haue care of her owne head and thine, for I come hether to maiſter her enchauntment, and to ſet the iniuried Lady at libertie. The old Knight, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning him any aunſwere, went backe againe to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtell, and <hi>Florian</hi> ſtaying to ſée what would enſue héereon, beheld a large table thruſt out at a window, vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which was brought forth the young Lady <hi>Argentina,</hi> by the two Squires and the auncient Knight, where they cauſing her to fall downe vppon her knees, the olde man, with a loude voyce, ſpake as followeth.</p>
               <p>Knight, lay violent hands vppon thine owne life, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſée this Lady perriſh. <hi>Florian,</hi> ſéeing his comming thether ſhould cauſe the death of <hi>Argentina,</hi> whereas his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent was to ſet her at libertie: became ſo troubled in his thoughts, as he rather choſe to die himſelfe, then to be the occaſion of her murdering, and therefore hee called to the old man, ſaying. I pray thée good Father, put not to death an innocent Lady, but rather come worke thy will on mée, ſince I am come hether to procure her perrill. And doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it had ſorted to that iſſue, for <hi>Florian</hi> at the old Knights comming, would more willingly haue ſent his head to the Sorcereſſe, then there to haue beheld y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death of <hi>Argentina.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Dorina,</hi> who had followed him thether inuiſible, as being greatly afraide of <hi>Druſa Velonna,</hi> cauſed a Knight to ſteale vppon him, and ſmiting him trecherouſly with a Launce, fledde backe againe to the wood: and <hi>Florian</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at ſuch a diſcourteſie, purſued him very angerly, till béeing farre enough from the Caſtell, the Knight ſhewed himſelfe to be <hi>Dorina,</hi> and ſpake vnto him in this manner. Vnderſtand (thou worthy-bearer of Armes,) that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer thou beholdeſt at the Caſtel, are nothing els but méere
<pb facs="tcp:14347:261"/>
illuſions, purpoſely doone to feare and diſmay thée. Shee whom thou ſaweſt ready to looſe her head, is not <hi>Argentina,</hi> but a counterfeit Image in her ſhape, therefore returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine before the Caſtell, and ſhewe thy ſelfe ſo inly toucht with griefe, at beholding a ſpectacle ſo ſad and moouing, as if very conceit thereof were ready to kill thee. Then when the old man comes to haue thy head, diſſemble cunningly, as if thou couldeſt not readily vndooe the laces of thy Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, that he may drawe neere to lend thee his helpe: then quickly catch him faſt by the long beard, becauſe therin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines the ſtrength of the enchauntment. Nowe knowe withall, that the olde Knight is <hi>Druſa Velonna</hi> ſo meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoſed, of whom be ſure to haue an eſpeciall care, for feare ſhe get againe at libertie: becauſe I (hauing told the way to ſurpriſe her) ſhall be moſt cruelly handled by her, if euer ſhe get looſe and eſcape from thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Florian</hi> right ioyfull of this good aduiſe, returned ſpéedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to the Caſtell, where the old Knight ſeeing him come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, continued his former menacing of the Lady, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at <hi>Florian</hi> expreſſed ſuch extraordinarie paſſions, as he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ready to ſinck into the ground with griefe, offering if he had tenne thouſand liues, to looſe them all ere <hi>Argentina</hi> ſhould miſcarie. The old Knight, not a little proude here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, came foorth of the Caſtell, (as before he had doone) with the two Squires, and comming to <hi>Florian,</hi> found his lookes ſo ſad and penſiuely deiected, with a willing preparation to his death, that the inward ioy of the Knight for this good fortune, made him the leſſe héedfull to that which followed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Florian</hi> kept a fumbling about his Helmet, as not able to vntie the laces thereof, where-vppon the olde Knight io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly offered his aſſiſtaunce, when he preſently faſtening hold on his heard, ſawe him immediatly altered to <hi>Druſa Velonna,</hi> whom (by reaſon he had ſeene before elſe-where) he very well knewe, and ſpake to her thus.</p>
               <p>Thou wicked woman, I haue thée now at ſome aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, quickly conduct me into the Caſtell, that I may ſette the young Lady <hi>Argentina</hi> at libertie. <hi>Velonna</hi> fearefullie
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:14347:261"/>
trembling, by teares and intreates laboured to haue him kiſſe her, promiſing then to performe whatſoeuer hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded: but <hi>Dorina</hi> comming at the inſtant, cryed out vnto him. Kiſſe her not Knight, for then ſhe kills thee, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther truſt any of the damned Witches promiſes, beware (beſide) thou goe not into the Caſtell, for then thou canſt neuer returne backe againe: but commaund her that <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentina,</hi> and ſome other Ladies encloſed with her, may be brought foorth hether, then take the chayne-girdle from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her, and binde her hands ſtrongly therewith, that ſhe be not able to get away from thée.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Florian</hi> commaunded her, to haue <hi>Argentina</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ladies brought foorth, which <hi>Velonna</hi> in very hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble manner performed: then iſſued faire <hi>Argentina</hi> out of the Caſtell, and diuers other Ladies in company with her, on whom ſhe had wrought her damnable trecherie, &amp; they beeing come before the Prince, <hi>Dorina</hi> put her hand into <hi>Velonnas</hi> boſome, and tooke out a booke, which was the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deereſt iewell for maintenaunce of her Arte, wherat ſhe was euen readie to die with ſorrow.

                  <hi>Aliarte</hi> managed this buſines ſo cunningly, that the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was deliuered, the Princeſſe <hi>Polynarda</hi> being by, who hearing this Letter to come from her ſonne, was the more deſirous to reade it, and hauing thorowly peruſed it, ſhe ſaid. My Lord and huſband, I pray yee, much rather for faire <hi>Candidaes</hi> ſake, then for our noble ſonnes, that you would forbeare to follow him, to the end no greater diſaſter may betide the ſilly Lady: but if you will needes be ſo forward, then I pray yée take me along with yée, that I may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectiue of the Ladies honour, whatſoeuer happen to our ſonne <hi>Leonato.</hi> When <hi>Palmerin</hi> ſaw he could by no means recouer <hi>Candida,</hi> without manifeſt note of being enamou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of her, he would giue his Lady no aunſwere, but a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger comming for him, he went preſently to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour: and <hi>Polynarda,</hi> not knowing her fathers change from his former affection, went after her huſband, onely to be the hinderance of his iourney. Being come into his preſence, the graue olde Emperour with a ſmiling countenance ſpake as followeth,</p>
               <p>Lord <hi>Palmerin,</hi> if both you and I had not committed ſome errour in our loue, I would haue appointed, a very ſeuere proſecution againſt <hi>Leonato:</hi> but when I call to minde, how many ſeuerall dangers I oppoſed my ſelfe againſt, to gaine the loue of my Empreſſe <hi>Grydonia,</hi> I can but count it iuſtice, hauing (my ſelfe) wrongd the péereleſſe vertue of her loue, to pardon the light tranſgreſſion of an amourous young man. Therefore I will that our ſentence of baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſtand no longer vpon <hi>Leonato,</hi> or any of our Court to follow in purſute of him: only let it be thus, if he demeane not him ſelfe like an honourable Knight to the Lady, a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment accordingly ſhal be inflicted on him, forbeare then to vndertake ſuch needeleſſe trauaile, and let vs ſende for <hi>Tarnaes,</hi> to beſtow on him (according to our paſſed promiſe) the beautifull <hi>Fior-nouella</hi> in mariage. Theſe words did wound <hi>Palmerin</hi> to the very hart, eſpecially being ſpoken in the preſence of his wife, who marked well his alteration of countenance, and there-with gaue <hi>Leonatoes</hi> Letter to the
<pb facs="tcp:14347:264"/>
Emperour, which when he had reade, and perceaued that <hi>Leonato</hi> had eſpouſed the Lady, he wexed very ioyfull, ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his idle deſſeigne in loue ſo well diſappointed, and his thoughts quite diſcharged of their former tormentes, for ſhould his vaine opinion ſtill haue continued, hee ſawe no meanes left of euer attaining it.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Aliarte</hi> behelde all thinges in ſo good an order for <hi>Leonato,</hi> he purpoſed to let his owne fond loue neuer be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered, &amp; brake off all fruitleſſe expectation that way, ſince two ſo great Princes had brideled their affections. And for the more certainty, that no miſhap might befall faire <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dida,</hi> he wrought in ſuch manner by his Arte, that a Squire ouer-tooke <hi>Tarnaes</hi> in his trauaile, and riding a while with him, told him, that <hi>Leonato</hi> was returned to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where by the honourable meanes of <hi>Polynarda</hi> his mother, he had eſpouſed <hi>Candida:</hi> beſide (quoth he) I heard the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour make earneſt enquirie, for a Nephewe of his, who was ſonne to king <hi>Platir</hi> of <hi>Lacedemonia,</hi> on whom he meant to beſtowe in mariage, the daughter of noble <hi>Palmerin</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> but the Knights name I doo not well remember.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tarnaes</hi> highly ioyed with theſe ſo pleaſing and happy newes, began to conceaue, that if he returnd not the ſooner to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> ſome ſuſpect might be gathered, that hee was not willing to accept the Lady as his wife: wherefore parting from the Squire, pretending to him a very farre iourney, he repaired ſpeedily to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and no ſooner was he entred the Pallace, but he met with the Princeſſe <hi>Polynarda,</hi> who taking him very kindly by the hand, ſayde. My Lord <hi>Tarnaes,</hi> your preſence hath greatly beene deſired in this Court, that a royall promiſe made you might be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Almerin</hi> hauing intelligence that <hi>Tarnaes</hi> was returned to Court againe, hee obtayned a ſolemne conference with the Emperour <hi>Primaleon</hi> and his wife <hi>Polynar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> about the beſtowing of <hi>Fior-nouella</hi> on him in mariage, and the eſpouſall beeing fully agréed vppon, the learned <hi>Aliarte</hi> came into the Emperors preſence, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Great Maieſtie, and you the reſt héere graciouſly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, in performing your paſſed promiſes, concerning <hi>Tarnaes</hi> and the faire <hi>Fior-nouella,</hi> it is a caſe both iuſt and honourable: yet let me tell yée, there ought to be no ſuch ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonious rites performed, till firſt thoſe weightier eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalls be finiſhed, of <hi>Primaleon</hi> with <hi>Victoria,</hi> and <hi>Arguto</hi> with the ſwéete young Lady <hi>Concordia,</hi> which once accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, there are other inamoratoes of this Court, that look to haue like grace extended them.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſpéeches were very pleaſing to the Emperour, and all the reſt in preſence, and as they further diſcourſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, tidings entred the Hall, that <hi>Florian</hi> was arriued in the Port, with faire <hi>Argentina,</hi> and <hi>Druſa Velonna</hi> as his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, which newes were gracde with a generall welcom, for all the Lords &amp; Ladies gaue a preſent teſtimony therof, by being at an inſtant mounted on their Palfrayes, &amp; riding in comly equipage down to the Port, where they found <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentina</hi> newly come forth of the Ship, whom after they had ſeuerally kiſt and embraced, ſhe was ſeated likewiſe on a
<pb facs="tcp:14347:265"/>
gallant proude Iennet, and <hi>Druſa Velonna</hi> (bound to her good behauiour) vpon an other. Thus with Prince <hi>Florian</hi> rode they along in great ſtate to the Court, where being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted and aſcended the great Hall, the Emperour gaue them moſt royall entertainment: but when he vnderſtood, how <hi>Velonna</hi> had behaued her ſelfe toward Prince <hi>Florian,</hi> with a frowning countenance he ſaide vnto her. Thou ill naturde woman, could not thy ſecret eſcape ſuffice thée, in contempt of all our gracious fauours toward thée, but ſtill thou muſt aime thy malice at vs and our Court? a more warie reſpect héereafter ſhall attend thée: and becauſe his words ſhould be ſealed with déedes, he preſently commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that ſhe ſhould be encloſed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame yron Cage, which <hi>Palmerin d'Oliua</hi> kept his witching enemie in. Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, they ſate pleaſantly conferring in other matters, the Emperour holding <hi>Florian</hi> by one hand, and <hi>Argentina</hi> by an other, highly extolling the Prince for his magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous ſpirit, and the woorthy aduentures by him perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
               <p>But leaue we them in Court thus gladly diſpoſed, and come againe to <hi>Leonato,</hi> who hauing trauailed ten dayes together, came at laſt into an euen champaigne ſoyle, very much heated and ſcorched by the Sunnes power: there met he neither with man or woman, nor could happen on any water to coole his thirſt. Thus rode he on till halfe the day was ſpent, till at length he came among certaine ſtraunge ſhapen trées, with ſuch little leaues as he had neuer ſeene the like, vnder them he purpoſed to reſt a while, feeding on ſuch thinges as his Squire had brought with him, which hardly aunſwered his preſent extremity. And much more were his thoughts afflicted, in regard of his deare eſtéemed <hi>Candida,</hi> neuer vſed to taſt of ſuch diſaſters, and therefore the more vnapt for her tender nature: but to rid themſelues from ſo vaſt and a deſert place, they tooke horſe againe, and rode till euening, yet could not out-ſtrip this deſolate Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. Looking (with a gréeued minde) round about him, to ſée if comfort might any where be expected, vpon his left
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:14347:265"/>
hand he diſcerned a little light, and thether he went, hoping to gaine there (by force or faire meanes) ſome ſuch neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries as they ſtoode in néede of.</p>
               <p>Beeing come to the place where he eſpied the light, hee found it to be a narrow houſe of thatch, but built ſomewhat high, where a man and woman of a Giant-like ſtature, came to vnderſtand the cauſe of his comming thether: but being vnacquainted with ſuch ſalutations as <hi>Leonato</hi> gaue them, they had him in their language, and witneſſed the ſame by outward ſignes, that he ſhould enter into their cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. Which when he had done, he ſaw a ſonne of theirs, turning on a ſpit a whole Boare at the fire, and beeing by becks and nods bidden to ſit downe, the woman Giant kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled certaine ſticks of wood, which burnt as light as anie candles: then couerd ſhee a great table, and ſet the whole Boare vppon it, as wee doo vſually any diſh for ſeruice. By this time had <hi>Leonato</hi> ſtept forth, and (vpon this cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous entertainment) brought thether his faire Lady <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dida,</hi> and although he nor ſhe vnderſtoode theſe Giants lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, yet by ſuch ſignes as they made to them, they ſate downe with them at the table, and fed very hungerly vpon the meate, by reaſon their appetite very well ſerude them, and their drink was cleare fountaine water, whereof they had plenty néere to that cottage. The Giant well noting the beauty of <hi>Candida,</hi> became ſurprized there-with in ſuch vehement manner, as diuers times he would gladly haue embraced her: but that he behelde, how <hi>Leonato</hi> fed with his armour on, &amp; his ſword hanging ſtill by his ſide, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he determined, to diſpoſſeſſe him of the Lady while he ſhould ſléepe.</p>
               <p>So, without any euident appearance of loue to her, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per being ended, he ſhewed them a pallet of leaues, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they ſhould reſt ſo well as they could: now by reaſon the night before, and all the whole day had béene very moleſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to them, they ſlept ſo ſoundly, that the Giant might the more eaſily carrie thence <hi>Candida,</hi> as indéede he did, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any knowledge of the Lady her ſelfe. Into a néere ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyning
<pb facs="tcp:14347:266"/>
thicket he caried her, which him ſelfe had planted with his owne hands, where hee found the Ladies beauty ſo piercing to him, as he durſt not awake her: by which happy meanes, <hi>Candida</hi> was preſerued from diſhonour, for otherwiſe this ſhameleſſe man, making no account of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane behauiour, if he could not by faire meanes haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed his deſire, in brutiſh manner he would haue rauiſht her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leonato</hi> ſléeping ſtill profoundly, dreamed that a great Serpent would haue deuourde him aliue, hauing gotten his foote already in his mouth, at which very inſtant, the Gianteſſe (full of iealous fury) hauing noated the vnman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie acte of her huſband, came and wakened <hi>Leonato,</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Ariſe Sir Knight, or elſe thy Lady will be diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leonato</hi> ſtarted vp like one halfe franticke, &amp; miſſing his <hi>Candida,</hi> perceaued by ſignes which the Gianteſſe made, that her huſband had caried her into a Cops hard by: and lacing his helmet ſuddainly on, hee went according as the Gianteſſe directed him, and hauing gone about halfe a mile in the thicket, hee heard the voyce of his <hi>Candida,</hi> ſaying: Help me O heauen, that I be not diſhonoured by this beaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie man.</p>
               <p>Theſe words added ſuch wings to his haſt, that he came quickly to them, and found the Giant on his knees before <hi>Candida,</hi> vſing infinite perſwaſions to obtaine his purpoſe. <hi>Leonato</hi> ſtept vppon him in ſuch fury, without giuing any warning for the defence of him ſelfe, (as the duty of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode partly commaundeth) he lifted vp his ſword to ſmite off his head: and doubtleſſe had done it, but that the Gian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſe (repenting ſhe had guided thether the Knight) cried out. Oh holde your hand Sir, and doo not depriue my huſband of his life, albeit in iuſtice his merit is no leſſe.</p>
               <p>Now although he vnderſtoode not what ſhe ſaide, yet he perceaued, that ſhee was loath to haue her huſband ſlaine, wherefore he helde his hand, and ſpared the Giant: who riſing vp in an extreame rage, and purpoſing to be reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:14347:266"/>
on the Knight, ranne preſently to his Cottage, where he buckled on a great Shéelde, and a mighty long ſworde, and lacing on his helmet, which after the auncient faſhion was without any beauer, he returned to <hi>Leonato,</hi> who held faire <hi>Candida</hi> by the hand, right kindly appeaſing her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer gréefe and feare.</p>
               <p>Fond Knight (quoth the Giant) Ile teach thée the price of hindering my pleaſure, and drawing his ſworde, ſmote firſt at the Lady, who fearefully fell backward, which fall ſo outragiouſly madded <hi>Leonato,</hi> that deliuering a maine full ſtroke at the Giant, he cleft his Shéelde quite through the middeſt, the one halfe falling downe on the ground, and the blow ſliding downe with no meane force, pierced quite through the armour vnder his ſide, and gaue the Giant two little hurts. But he returned a ſhrewde requitall with his heauie long ſworde, which lighting rudely on his helmet, ſmote him downe in a traunce, and the Giant making vſe of that aduantage, caught him vp on his necke, intending to drowne him in the neere adioyning Fountaine: yet as he went along, hee looked on bright <hi>Candida,</hi> who (fearing now to be rauiſhed indeede) ſeeing her Knight in ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate caſe, fled a pace from the Giant, hoping in ſhort while to get out of his ſight.</p>
               <p>Hée purpoſing at one inſtant to ridde him ſelfe of the Knight, and haue the Lady in his owne poſſeſſion, threwe <hi>Leonato</hi> againſt the ground ſo cruelly, as the very fall had béene ſufficient to haue ſlaine him: but by great good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, the Gianteſſe hauing layd together, boughs, leaues, and little ſhrubbes in diuers parts of the Wood, to ſerue them for fewell in the Winter ſeaſon: it was his chaunce to light on one of thoſe heapes, ſo that he had no great harme by the fall, albeit the Giant hoped the contrary, who pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing <hi>Candida,</hi> had ſoone ouer-taken her, but that the hurts in his ſide were ſome hinderance to him.</p>
               <p>The Lady poſting on the wings of her ſtrong feare, gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a good diſtaunce of ground, in which ſpace, <hi>Leonato</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a very great ſpirit, recouered againe, yet ouercome
<pb facs="tcp:14347:267"/>
with extreamity of gréefe, leaſt <hi>Candida</hi> (whom he could no where behold) was become a pray to the Giants baſe luſt. As he gazed round about him onely to eſpie her, he ſaw her come running mainly toward him, and the Giant follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but ſomewhat further off: with exceeding ioy he ranne to meete her, and taking her by the hand, oppoſed him ſelfe to defend her againſt the Giant, who came with an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute intent to haue ſlaine him: but hee hauing felt the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants ſtearne force, auoyded his ſtrokes cunningly, and ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping one blow made ſo mainly at him, as the point of the Giants ſword ſtabd farre into the earth, he followed this opportunity, and ſmote the helmet quite off from his head, though it coſt him a wound in the flanke for his labour, ſo ſoone as the Giant had fréed his ſworde againe, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward another vpon his left ſhoulder, from both which hurts the blood iſſued forth very liberally.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leonato</hi> tooke this ſomewhat ſtraungely, and began to conſider with him ſelfe, that all this was too little for his Ladies ſafety: yet if in this conflict he ſhould looſe his life, and ſhee afterward be by him brutiſhly abuſed, his ſoule could endure no greater a torment. Where-vpon, trauer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing light about from place to place, and temporizing his owne trauaile, to kéepe him ſelfe ſtill in ſome ſtate of abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that the Giant (by the liberall expence of his blood, which drild downe his armour a pace from his woundes) might haue the leſſe meanes to hold out againſt him, he found this his likelieſt courſe of preuailing: but the Giant feeling his ſtrength to weaken more and more, leapt vpon <hi>Leonatoes</hi> backe, and catching him faſt about the neck, ſtrugled very hard to ouer-throw him, but then he graſping the Giant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the body, wroong him ſtrongly by very meere force, that they both fell together vpon the ground, yet <hi>Leonatoes</hi> good hap was to be vppermoſt. Now was he in greater pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill then before, for the Gianteſſe, ſeeing her huſband ready to be ſlaine, caught vp a great braunch of a tree lying by her, &amp; running to <hi>Leonato</hi> triumphing ouer the Giant, thought to beate out his braines there-with, that he might not ſtab
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:14347:267"/>
her huſband with his dagger, which hee held ready for the purpoſe in his hand. When <hi>Candida</hi> ſaw the deſperate ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of her Louer, ſhe cryed out aloude, that he ſhould take héede of that bloodie minded Woman, and <hi>Leonato</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his imminent perrill, ſpurning her backward with his foote, ordered the matter in ſuch ſort with the Giant, that he ſtabd his weapon quite thorow his hart: and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning afterward to the Gianteſſe, had giuen her ſuch correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as her trecherie deſerued, but that ſhe ran behind <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dida,</hi> and falling on her knées to her, entreated her to begge pardon for her of her Knight.</p>
               <p>The pittifull-minded Lady, perceiuing how <hi>Leonato</hi> intended to kill her, deſired him to remit her treſpaſſe, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted but in the defence of her huſbands life: which proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to be the ſafety of the Gianteſſe, for <hi>Leonato</hi> hearing himſelfe intreated by her, who might co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund him to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture through any danger whatſoeuer, ſaid, hee would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ſaue her life, but ſhee ſhould goe along with him to <hi>England.</hi> So, binding her hands, they went with her to the Cottage, where finding her young ſonne, he bound him by the féete alſo, leaſt he ſhould ſcape from him, then made hée ſignes to the Gianteſſe, that ſhe ſhould prepare ſome-what for them to eate: ſhe ſtepping preſently to a ſafe, wherein ſhe vſed to kéepe her prouiſion, brought forth a you<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g Fawne and two little Boares, which the young Giant &amp; his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dreſt in ſuch manner, as they were quickly prouided of a dinner.

When theſe newes were brought to the King <hi>Don Edward,</hi> hee acquainted faire <hi>Flerida</hi> his Quéene there-with, and appointed that moſt part of the Engliſh Nobilitie, ſhould ride to meete them tenne miles from the Citty of <hi>London:</hi> himſelfe accompanied with his greateſt Lords &amp; Barons, rode out of the Cittie aboue two miles, where méeting with his graund-ſonne, and bright <hi>Candida</hi> riding hand in hand, hee wondred to behold two ſuch goodly creatures, but eſpecially, faire <hi>Candidaes</hi> beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie amazed him, ſo that he began (almoſt) to be ſicke of the Emperour <hi>Primaleons</hi> doating diſeaſe.

                  <hi>Flerida</hi> and her traine of Ladies, ſhe hauing long deſired to ſée <hi>Leonato,</hi> becauſe it was often told her, that he much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled her Father, <hi>Palmerin d' Oliua,</hi> his perfect Image appearing ſo liuely in this young Prince, as if himſelfe had at that inſtant béene liuing.</p>
               <p>So rode they thorow the Cittie (with much ioy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light) toward the Pallace, the people expreſſing all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect-like loue and reioycing: for ſince the returne of King <hi>Edward</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> after his recouery by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> precous oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there was no other talke but of mirth &amp; iouiſſaunce.

               <p>The King perceiuing <hi>Leonatoes</hi> earneſt deſire, to haue the marriage ſollemnized betwéene him and <hi>Candida,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his Lords to councell, to vnderſtand their oppinions in the caſe: where it was concluded, that the next Sonday en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing, it ſhould be performed, with the greateſt ſollemnitie that could be deuiſed.

               <p>
                  <hi>Oliuanto</hi> who left <hi>Constantinople,</hi> when his Father <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendos</hi> and he ſeuerally intended, to trauaile in the recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the faire <hi>Argentina,</hi> trauailed through diuers ſtrange Countries, without ſtay or contradiction in any part, til at length he happened to the place where the Adamant Caſtle ſome-time ſtoode, and becauſe that Field was vnfurniſhed of trées, the Sunne at mid-day ſhone ſo hotely on him, as it ſcalded him through his Armour. Heereupon hee alighted from his horſe, and ſhadowing himſelfe among the ſtones of the ruined Caſtell, hee found himſelfe drawne and knit thereto with ſuch violence, as hee could by no meanes get
<pb facs="tcp:14347:269"/>
from thence: whereat he meruailing not a little, ſtroue to créepe from the ſtones by his vtmoſt ſtrength, but he found himſelfe bound thereto the faſter.</p>
               <p>Béeing vexed in minde at this ſtrange accident, and ſtudying how he ſhould accompliſh the reſt of his intended trauaile, a Swaine of the country paſſing that way, when he ſawe the Knight faſtened to the ſtones in ſuch ſort, with his Mattocke on his necke hee came to him, ſaying: Sir Knight, you can neuer part hence, except yee put off your Armour, for this is the Adamant ſtone, which drawes all kinde of yron to it.</p>
               <p>Now was his griefe far greater then before, when hée heard that he muſt needes leaue his Armour behind him, which was to ſted him in all perrils, whatſoeuer: and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king better on the place, he perceiued that the ſame tower or Caſtell had ſtoode there, wherein deſiring the Peazant further to reſolue him, he told him: Howe <hi>Druſa Velonna</hi> by magicall arte, had built a Caſtell there on a Rocke of Adamant, and kept therein a Lady of the Grecian Court, whom a Knight of the ſame Court had deliuered and borne thence.</p>
               <p>Héereby <hi>Oliuanto</hi> conceiued, that doubtleſſe the Ladie was <hi>Argentina,</hi> for he knew of the fréedom of the other two before, but he could not imagine who the Knight ſhould be: and ſéeing he muſt néedes part with the loſſe of his armour, he aſked the Country-man, if there were no way to gette looſe without loſſe of his Armes. At that very inſtant, one of the Ladies, who had beene priſoner in the Caſtell with <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentina,</hi> riding by the place, and ſéeing the Knight ſo faſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by his Armour, trotted her Palfrey thether, ſaying. The curteſie of Prince <hi>Florian,</hi> in fréeing me and other La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies out of this ruined Tower, where wee were enchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with faire <hi>Argentina,</hi> bindes mee to lend yee ſuch aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, as you ſhall follow your knightly affaires, and yet not leaue your Armour héere. So, alighting fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her horſe, ſhee tooke a Crimoſine Mantle which was wrapt about her, and ſpreading it ouer <hi>Oliuanto</hi> and his Squire, the
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:14347:269"/>
Adamant immediatly yéelded and loſt his vertue, whereby they were at their former libertie.</p>
               <p>As they rode thence in company of the Lady, ſhee told <hi>Oliuanto</hi> at large, in what manner <hi>Florian</hi> had ended the aduenture, and becauſe his thoughts were altogether ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to ſée his déere affected <hi>Auriana,</hi> (who gladly would haue ſtayed him from purſuing this aduenture, but that hée preſently told her, how a Knight ſhould ſhunne no occaſion whatſoeuer, whereby to rancke him-ſelfe among thoſe of greateſt merrit) ſéeing the Lady ready to ride from him at a croſſe-parting way, right curteouſly he tooke his farewel of her, with hartie thanks for ſtedding him in ſo vrgent an neceſſitie.</p>
               <p>And béeing come to the Sea-ſide, he was ſoone prouided of ſhipping, ſayling in ſhort while to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where he was honourably welcommed: eſpecially by his Ladie <hi>Auriana,</hi> as one right ioyfull of his high good fortunes, and hoping of ſpéedie attainement of their long deſired ioyes.</p>
               <p>In this time of generall contentation, the Emperor had ſent tidings through moſt parts of the world, to aduertiſe his Knights, that the thrée Ladies (ſtolne from the Courte by <hi>Druſa Velonna,</hi>) were againe recouered: and therefore they ſhould repayre to his Court, becauſe hee would haue none abſent at ſuch a meete time of ioying, wherby it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, that many were come in againe in very ſhort while. The firſt was <hi>Berolde,</hi> King of <hi>Spayne,</hi> who hearing of his Daughters deliuerance, poaſted with ſpéede toward <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> meeting by the way with <hi>Caro</hi> and <hi>Armindo,</hi> who had loſt much labour in ſearch of the Princeſſe, &amp; hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring now ſuch gladſome tydings, returned with <hi>Berolde,</hi> without ſtaying any where till they came at <hi>Constantinople, <hi>Berolde</hi>
                  </hi> reioycing not a little at the ſight of his Daughter. Soone after came newes, how in one Ship were come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, <hi>Don Roſuell, Francian, Fortenbracio,</hi> and <hi>Orino:</hi> but becauſe <hi>Don Roſuell</hi> was of eſpeciall eſtéeme in the Court, many Lords &amp; Knights rode to welcome him, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to the Pallace very honorably.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14347:270"/>As they were entring the gate, they beheld a Knight who had come by Land, and ſtaying to be further reſolued who he was, when he came neerer them, his Caſke being open, they knew him to be <hi>Forcino,</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Dragonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,</hi> who by his owne guiltie deſtenie, was the amourous ſeruaunt to faire <hi>Spina</hi> of <hi>Fraunce:</hi> but ſhee beeing proude and curious, would neuer acknowledge any of his knightly ſeruices, wherefore he liued in very deſperate eſtate for her loue. Theſe youthful gallants being thus come to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Court, the Emperours ioyes excéedingly encreaſed, to ſée them in this noble manner about him, whom they loued as if hee had beene their Father.</p>
               <p>While the Court was in this ouer-flow of pleaſure, one day as they ſate in the Hall together, there entred a Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell, attended on by two comely Squires, who hauing doone dutious reuerence to the Emperour, deliuered him a Letter, which beeing read by <hi>Palmerin,</hi> appeared to come from <hi>Don Edward</hi> the King of <hi>England,</hi> &amp; importing a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meſſage to be deliuered by the Damoſell, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour commaunded her to ſpeake her minde, where-vppon ſhe began in this manner.</p>
               <p>High and mightie Lord, King <hi>Edward</hi> of <hi>England</hi> in loue ſalutes yée, with all this gallant and knightly aſſembly: entreating your Maieſtie, to pardon the offence of his graund-ſonne <hi>Leonato,</hi> in preſuming to beare hence the beautifull <hi>Candida,</hi> toward whom he hath demeaned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe like a vertuous Knight, &amp; married her in the preſence of King <hi>Edward</hi> and his Quéene. The Emperour, who ſince the comming of <hi>Aliarts</hi> Letter, had heard no other ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of this matter, but doubted leaſt ſome miſhap might betide <hi>Candida,</hi> though not by <hi>Leonato,</hi> (of whoſe honour and good cariage he neuer doubted) yet by ſome other ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter meanes: when he heard of their happy beeing in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and that King <hi>Edward</hi> ſpake in theyr behalfe, whom he could not (with honour) any way contradict, he thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied. Say to our louing Lord &amp; friend, that <hi>Leonato</hi> may returne to <hi>Constantinople</hi> ſafely at his good pleaſure, ſince
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:14347:270"/>
his behauiour hath béen ſo noble and knightly, aſſuring him we are no way diſpleaſed with him: wherefore we commit you Lady to your good reſt, allowing your returne to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> when it ſhall pleaſe your ſelfe.</p>
               <p>I deſire no reſt at all (quoth the Damoſell) till I haue deliuered in your preſence Lord <hi>Leonato,</hi> and his vertuous wife the Princeſſe <hi>Candida:</hi> ſo deſcending the ſteppes, and paſſing forth of the Citty, in leſſe then two houres ſhee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned againe, accompanied with <hi>Leonato</hi> and his Ladie, who entring hand in hand into the Hall, each one with chéerefull countenaunce entertained them: onely his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Palmerin</hi> excepted, who had not yet forgot the iniuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſpéeches, which his ſonne had ſo raſhly giuen the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror. But <hi>Leonato,</hi> feigning as if he diſcerned it not, ſtept before the Emperour, who taking both him and <hi>Candida</hi> vp from off their knees, kiſſed both their fore-heads: marie he beſtowed two kiſſes on <hi>Candida,</hi> in remembrance of the loue he ſome-time bare her, whereat there grew a generall ſmiling, in regard that his minde ſtill ſerued him to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amoured, though all the powers elſe of his bodie denied it.</p>
               <p>The elder Knights betooke themſelues to reſt, but the younger delicate bloods, whoſe ſoules did liue in the fayre eyes of theyr Miſtreſſes, they ſtroue by all poſſible meanes to purchaſe theyr fauours, hoping one day, (with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours gracious conſent) to enioy them in mariage. But leaue we this iocond Court in the height of felicitie, and let vs ſpeake now of <hi>Franardo</hi> and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other Giants, that went to conquer the Ile of the bottomleſſe Lake, tearmed in the former parts of this Hiſtorie, the <hi>Profound Ile.</hi>

                  <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Ramuſiande,</hi> beeing firſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with his ſonne, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward happening on <hi>Almaroll</hi> &amp; <hi>Forzato,</hi> according as hath béene alreadie declared, when they had acquainted him with theyr intention, of going to conquere the fore-named Iland, hee ſaid: That theyr hap was very good to meete with him, becauſe if they would goe to the Ile of the bottomleſſe Lake, hee could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme them of a place there, which was onely manifeſted to him by his Aunt <hi>Eutropa.</hi> For there was a water, which might not be paſſed with any boate or veſſell made of wood, but it muſt be hewen out of a ſtone which is lighter then wood, and was made onely by his Aunt herſelfe, and kept with great circumſpection in his Caſtell: and (the reaſon hereof was) becauſe they were to paſſe a certaine water, which (co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to the nature of all other waters) ſent forth continuall flames of fire, and preſently conſumed any boate of wood.</p>
               <p>Hee tolde them beſide, that this Iland was poſſeſt by a progenie of ſterne bloody Giants, who had forcibly taken it from his father <hi>Frenaque:</hi> but that which moſt of all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported their paynes, was the horrid and ſtrange enchaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the Ile, which his Aunte <hi>Eutropa</hi> had not the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to finiſh, but had left certaine aduertiſements with him in writing, which being coupled with theyr valour, would
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:14347:271"/>
giue them the greater hope of victory, and the booke of theſe aduertiſements he kept in his owne Caſtell.</p>
               <p>Theſe outward appearances of ſo great difficulty, kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled ſuch forward deſires in the Giants, that they could not be quiet till they came thether: wherefore they earneſtly entreated <hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> not to ſlowe time in haſtening to the Ile, leaſt ſome other might rob them of the honour of this aduenture. <hi>Franardo</hi> would gladly haue ſtolne thether alone, to diſpoſſeſſe the reſt of ſo much honour, as in ſuch an high enterpriſe might well be expected: but hearing that the glory deuided among foure, in conquering ſo many Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants and dangerous perrills, was as great as if one man ſhould end an enchauntment, he yéelded the more willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to trauaile altogether. So in leſſe then foure dayes they came to <hi>Dramuſiandes</hi> Caſtell, where reſting them ſelues one day, the boate was made ready for their paſſage on the fierie water, and conuayed to ſuch a place, as without any contradiction they might ſet thence: and hauing put vp the booke in his boſome, they furniſhed them ſelues with the beſt armour which was to be had, becauſe they ſhould ſtand in great néed thereof. The boat being brought to the mouth of the Lake, they as yet rode all along by the waters ſide, becauſe them ſelues being weighty, would not endanger it againſt the craggie rockes, which riſing ſomewhat high in the Riuer, might the ſooner breake it.</p>
               <p>Hauing ridden ſo farre as they thought conuenient, they left their Horſes with their Squires, and went aboord with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Mariners: for the boate only mooued by the words (which <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> reade in the booke) and flew with ſuch ſwiftnes, as if it had béene an arrowe through the ayre. When it came to the flaming Lake, the very ſtouteſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them began to be aſtonned, for the flames did folde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them in ſuch ſtrange manner, as if they felt their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour on fire about them, and the boate it ſelfe was ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely hot, that they could abide by no means to touch it. So that they had béene in moſt miſerable eſtate, if the boat had not made ſuch extraordinarie expedition, and floating
<pb facs="tcp:14347:272"/>
along ſtill through the fierie flames, at laſt it came to a very coole water, which was no meane comfort in quallifying their long heate: there did they diſcerne the Iland not farre off, and <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> reading in other places of the booke, cauſed the boate to ſtay a while, as meaning not to paſſe to the Iland till the next morning, becauſe being ignorant of the créekes and reaches, the Giants might worke ſome treacherie to them in the night time.</p>
               <p>Abiding there vpon this determination, they ſpent the time in conferring with <hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> how they ſhould ſort them ſelues together for the combates, becauſe they knew not how many Giants they were to fight withall: wherein <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> reſolude them ſo farre as he could, ſaying (as he had learned by his Aunt) that they vſed not to weare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie ſtrong Armour, ſo reſted they for this night, without any treacherie or inconuenience. In the morning they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waked very early, and went towarde the Iland, <hi>Dramu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiande</hi> reading ſuch words of Arte, as made the boate goe merily thether, and there they entended to be the ſooner, becauſe the Giants might not lay their traynes abroade, to endanger their lyues before their landing, but rather that they might ſteale vpon them vnſéene. At Sunne riſing, the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ate ſhot into a little bay of the Ile, and our foure Giants, armed at all points for their purpoſe, with their Shéeldes ſtrongly faſtened on, and very ponderous Axes in theyr hands, went foorth vppon the ſhoare, and eſpying a great Tower in the midſt of the Iland, thether they ſhaped their courſe directly. Not farre had they gone, but they were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpied by two young Giants, who were thus early going on hunting, and imagining they would offer them no reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce, they perceaued preſentlie they came to aſſayle them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Franardo</hi> deſirous to cope with them firſt, ſtept formoſt to méete them, and receaued two arrowes vpon his Armour, which being of ſound proofe, withſtoode their entrance, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they made an inward denting, as if they had beene the puſhes of two Launces: héereby he perceaued the ſtrength
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:14347:272"/>
of thoſe people, and how induſtrious they were in the feate of ſhooting. Boldly he ſtept to them, and lifting his Axe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the formoſt, who had nockt another arrowe ready in his bowe, by reaſon he was vnarmed, he cleft him from the left ſhoulder downe to the flancke, ſo that immediatly hee tumbled downe dead: and the other (hauing neuer ſéene ſuch a ſtroke before) was abaſhed when he beheld his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion dead, and becauſe he deſired not the like ſalutation, he began to ſpéede away, but <hi>Franardo,</hi> (leaſt he ſhould giue warning to the reſt in the Iland) followed, and gaue him ſuch a cut in the head, as he was not able to runne any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>By this time, <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> and the reſt were come to him, all now going together toward the Tower, and there had they arriued without any hinderance: but that a Gian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſe (mother to the two young Giants ſlaine, ſtanding in the doore of an olde ruinous houſe, made of twigges and raf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters knit together,) eſpied this their miſhap, and therefore cried out aloude: Oh helpe, helpe, helpe, for our enemies are entred into the Iland. At this lamentable crie, the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants awaked, and making certaine openings in their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which ſerued them as windowes, they no ſooner beheld theſe foure armed Giants, but they preſently coniectured (as indéede it was) that theſe were ſome friends of <hi>Dramu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiandes,</hi> of whom they liued in hourely feare, becauſe they tooke this Iland from his Father, where-vpon they tooke vp their ſwords and ſhéeldes, and eight of them went foorth to make reſiſtaunce, while the reſt had leaſure to arme them ſelues.</p>
               <p>When our Giants ſawe theſe come againſt them, that ſo wondrouſly excéeded the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in ſtature, they diſmayed not a iote, but albeit they were ſomewhat weary, with running after the yong Giant, that would haue ſau'd his own life by flight, yet did they couragiouſly ſet vpon them, &amp; with their kéene Axes ſliced the others ſhéelds in péeces: receauing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them again ſuch puiſſant ſtroks, as they were hardly able to ſtand vnder the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for ſuch was their ſtrength, as eaſily they might
<pb facs="tcp:14347:273"/>
haue daſht them in péeces, if they had béene poſſeſt of ſkill and agility in Armes, or could haue borne them ſelues with prouidence againſt their enemies. But being almoſt ſpent with rage and fury, thrée of them was ſlaine, and the reſt ſo ſore wounded, as they were not able to reſiſt any longer, and then came forth the fiercer Giants, armed onely with a Gant-plate and their helmets, but no defence at all vpon their backs, becauſe they had neuer ſeene any ſuch armour. When theſe beheld the large expence of blood, of their neere alliance and reſpected friends, they were ſo outragiouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed, that they coulde not expect their enemies as they ſhould haue done, which they likewiſe well noting, left the other fiue, and preparing to entertaine theſe fierie fellowes, the greateſt Giant ſet vpon <hi>Franardo,</hi> another ſmote <hi>Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roll</hi> ſo ſtoutly on the helmet, that he fell downe backward in a ſwound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> ſéeing the ſtearne power of the Giants, could hardly gueſſe what their attempt would ſort vnto, and ſtepping before <hi>Almaroll,</hi> to ſheelde him from beeing thus ſlaine on the ground, he gaue ſuch a ſiding ſtroke with his Axe, as cut off one of the Giants legges, in which while <hi>Almaroll</hi> recouered, and being ſomwhat aſhamed of his fall, began to lay about him in ſuch ſort with his Axe, that hee wounded one of them very ſhrewdly on the arme, albeit he was ſo mighty of ſtature, that <hi>Almaroll</hi> ſeemed but like a Dwarffe to him. <hi>Forzato</hi> laboured earneſtly againſt one of them, and <hi>Franardo</hi> was twiſe in very great danger, but that his ſkill and dexterity very much holpe him, whereby he eſcaped many a pezant ſtroke, which falling on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground, ſeemed as they had lighted on a mountaine.</p>

                  <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> ſeeing <hi>Franardo</hi> in great perill of his life, ſmote mainly at his aduerſaries head, who to ſhun the blow of the Axe, receaude it on his Sheelde, but then <hi>Franardo</hi> giuing a thruſt at his enemies belly, made ſo large a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage through the Cuiraſſe, as his bowels were ready to fall out, and he glad to ſtay him ſelfe on his ſword from falling. Nowe would <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> needes rid him altogether, in
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:14347:273"/>
ſuccour of his ſonne, who was extreamely wearied, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſtepping to him, he ſaide: Get thee away on thy iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, ſince thou art ſo forward, for thou art but an hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to my ſonne, who is a coward if he ſend not another ſoone after thee.</p>
               <p>Theſe words ſo ſtird vp the ſpirit of <hi>Franardo,</hi> that laying on loade with dauntleſſe reſolution, he quickly diſpatcht an other after his fellow, and <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> added a third to the number: ſo that the fight being now growne equall, foure to foure, our Giants being the better armed, and of more cunning in mannaging their weapons, had the greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage againſt the other, and brought it to ſuch effect, as quickly had this battaile béen concluded: but that ten other Giants of leſſer ſtature, came freſhly vpon them, being lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle inferiour to the other in valour, and they with theyr Boare-ſpeares and hunting Iauelings, ſo ſharpely beſet them on euery ſide, as now they iudged them ſelues to be in great danger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Franardo</hi> hauing ſlaine his Giant of the foure, was round beſet by foure more of theſe other, ſo that now if he not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtird him ſelfe nimbly indeede, there was no remedy but he muſt needes periſh. <hi>Almaroll</hi> being likewiſe rid of his Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, though he was wounded in the arme, yet two of theſe freſh commers in aſſaulted him, who queſtionleſſe had ſlain him, if they had béene armed. <hi>Forzato</hi> hauing left his Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant but with one legge, buckled the readier with another of theſe ten, who had growne too ſtrong for him, but that <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maroll</hi> cleauing one of his cuſtomers downe the head, and making the other almoſt in as able a caſe, ſuccourd him a while, and then ranne to <hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> who had but three at once vpon him, broaching and goaring him with theyr Launces: but he which moſt moleſted him, was ſoone made quiet enough, and the haſtines of the other indifferently calmed, by meanes whereof he went to aſſiſt <hi>Forzato</hi> at a very narrow ſtrait, for his helmet was ſo batterd and bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that it pincht his head in ſo many ſeuerall places, as hee was conſtrained to take it quite off. One of thoſe that
<pb facs="tcp:14347:274"/>
fought with <hi>Franardo,</hi> ſéeing a fellow of his ſomewhat op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by two of our Giants, ranne ſpéedily to helpe him, and then flew vpon <hi>Forzato,</hi> whom he ſawe without a hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met. The fight continuing a long while in this manner, thoſe thrée that oppoſed themſelues againſt <hi>Franardo,</hi> ſéeing him (through ouer-much labour) to be very weary, not ſhif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from place to place as before he had doone: they ringd them ſelues about him, and lifting him from the ground by theyr ſtrength, meant to cary him away with them.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> who all the fight time had an eye to his ſonne, when hee ſawe him in ſuch a deſperate eſtate: gaue one of his enemies ſuch a furious ſtroke, as cutting quite through his Sheelde, entred into his belly, and his entrayles falling foorth, him ſelfe tumbled deade after. To another, whoſe left arme he had pittifully mangled, he gaue ſuch a ſuddaine fierce blowe, as cutting his Iaueling in the midſt, wounded him likewiſe aboue the eye, whence the blood ſtreaming forth aboundantly, he could not diſcerne which way he went.</p>
               <p>Being thus fréed of them, he ranne to ſtay thoſe Giants that caried his Sonne away, who ſéeing him comming, threw <hi>Franardo</hi> againſt the ground, and turning vpon <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſiande,</hi> he gaue them ſuch a gentle welcome, that he cut off the formoſt mans left arme, and afterward ranne his ſword quite through his breaſt. The other two affrighted at this accident, ſetting both their Boare-ſpeares rudely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his breaſt, caſt him along on his back, and aſſuredly had there ſlaine him, but that <hi>Almaroll</hi> and <hi>Forzato</hi> (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing each ſlaine one of their oppoſed enemies, and left the reſt in ſo weake diſpoſition, as they were able to endure no longer againſt them,) came ſpéedily to his helpe, endange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring greatly their owne liues thereby, in regarde of their former wounds, fainting and wearines, whereof the other Giants not a little triumphed.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> and <hi>Franardo</hi> recouering at one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, though both were ſore bruſed by their falls, yet did they aſſaile them with ſuch courage, as (after ſome fewe

blowes) they fell dead at their féete: and hauing there now no more to withſtand them, they entred a houſe neere ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyning, appearing to be more honourable then the other, there to binde vp their wounds, and reſt them ſelues.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the houſe which our wounded Giants had entred, were many young Gianteſſes, two whereof ſéemed to be of farre greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect then the reſt, who percea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing our Knights to be gentle, diſcréetly gouernd and ciuilly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired, though the large effuſion of their blood much altered their countenances, yet had they great compaſſion of them. <hi>Almaroll</hi> well noting this, and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king aduiſedly on them, becauſe their lookes likewiſe were modeſt and womanlie: went vnto them, and with gentle language entreated them that they would helpe to binde vp their wounds, which appeared to be very daungerous. The young Ladies, deſirous to doo them any honourable pleaſure, ſecretly ſayde: that they were very ready to cure their hurtes, prouided (for ſafety of their owne innocent lyues,) they would but ſay, that they had enforced them to this fauour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Almaroll</hi> turning backe to <hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> who as yet ſtayed without, and entred not the houſe, tolde him what the Ladies had ſayde vnto him, and hee entring the roome where the Ladies were, with a ſtearne countenaunce ſaide vnto them: Come quickly and helpe to dreſſe our wounds, for no iniurie ſhall be offered to your honours.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14347:275"/>The Ladies diſſembling before the reſt, as if they ſtoode greatly in feare of them, came preſently to them, and they (beeing diſarmed) had very ſoueraigne oyles and emplai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters applied to their hurts, beeing handled very tenderly and with choiſe regarde, with promiſe of ſpéedy recouerie, becauſe their wounds were not mortall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> afterward ſitting downe by them, demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded if there were any other Giants in the Iland, and why ſo many women liued together in that one houſe. The el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of the two Ladies, ſhowring downe teares from her eyes in great aboundance, began in this manner. Faire Sir, we two are Nieces to the Lord of this Iland, who is gone to a Caſtell called the <hi>Profound Tower,</hi> intending to bring hether two ſonnes of his, to whom (againſt our wils) he will giue vs in mariage, they being the moſt brutiſh and vnciuill men, liuing at this day in any part of the worlde: and his reaſon héerein is, to depriue vs this way of our inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, and make his ſonnes abſolute poſſeſſours thereof. This vniuſt act in him, is the cauſe why we would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes elſe diſpoſe of our ſelues, rather then to liue with ſuch as are loathſome to vs: wherefore if there bee any Knights among you, that are ſingle and vnmaried, as we are, wee will yeelde our perſons and honours into their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, and kindly accept them as our huſbands.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> had heard the Ladies iuſt cauſe of gréefe, and the liberall offer they tendered withall, he tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to <hi>Franardo,</hi> ſaying: You ſonne ſhall take one of theſe Ladies to wife, &amp; on <hi>Almaroll</hi> I meane to beſtow the other. <hi>Forzato</hi> beeing the youngeſt, was in hope ſome remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance would haue beene had of him: but <hi>Franardo,</hi> who lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <hi>Grando<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

My Lord and Father, I humbly entreate your pardon and the Ladies, that I haue béene ſo ſlacke in returning mine aunſwere: for my thoughts being long ſince obliged to an
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:14347:275"/>
other Ladie, whoſe loue I can no way iuſtly refuſe, hath béene the reaſon of my ſo long ſilence: but becauſe this La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die ſhall not be wrongd in her deſires, I will exchange one kindneſſe with <hi>Forzato,</hi> for receipt of another. I loue his faire and vertuous Siſter, and that he may with the better will beſtow her on mee in marriage, I am content to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne my right héere to him, in enioying one of theſe woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Ladies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Forzato</hi> being greatly enamoured of the eldeſt Ladie, falling ſuddenly on his knee before <hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> ſaid. My Lord, I may with iuſt reaſon account my ſelfe fortunate, that your ſonne <hi>Franardo</hi> ſo long hath accepted mee as his kinde companion, on whom I fréely beſtow my Siſter for mariage, without expectation of ſo gracious a requitall, which makes me to glory the more, that it was my good hap to promiſe him my Siſter. Hauing thus ſpoken, he roſe vp, and very louingly embraced his Brother: which <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſiande</hi> perceiuing, and noating withall what ſpeeches had béene paſt, appointed that <hi>Amaroll</hi> and <hi>Forzato</hi> ſhould eſpouſe the two Ladies, who béeing likewiſe pleaſed to their owne harts contentment, returned backe to theyr Chamber, to certefie vnto the reſt of the Gianteſſes, that they had no other conference, but of curing the Knights wounds.</p>
               <p>Soone after, our Knights ſent for them againe, to gather ſome enſtructions from them, how they ſhould beare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues againſt the Lord of the Iland, and compaſſe the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the enchauntment: but ſtill the caſe was cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly couered, &amp; <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> ſent twiſe imperiouſly for them, whereby the reſt coniectured, that they were forcibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to come to them, which the Ladies as queintly fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting by their behauiour, gaue them to vnderſtand. That a Giant, ſometime a ſeruant to their Father, but now atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on the Lord of the Iland, as being his Nephew, was newly there arriued, and told them, that his vnckle would not returne backe till tenne dayes were expired: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſlaughter of the Giants was reuealed to him, that
<pb facs="tcp:14347:276"/>
night he would carrie newes thereof to his vnckle. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Ladies aduiſed them to lay hold on him, that hee might not be the meſſenger of ſuch tidings to his Lord, ſo ſhould they haue the more time for curing their hurts: and hee returning without intelligence of his loſſe, could make the leſſe prouiſion for his miſhap, becauſe any aduantage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him was held for good, in regard hee was of ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable valour, that tenne other of his greateſt Giants could not ſtand againſt him, and his ſonnes likewiſe were very valiant, beſide diuers other in his company of ſinguler proweſſe.</p>
               <p>Concerning the enchauntment, they muſt preſerue the Vnckles life, who onely knewe the meanes howe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found it, albeit his taking would be ſomewhat troubleſome to them, and hardly ſhould they make him confeſſe, how the enchauntment was to be concluded. Then calling <hi>Franar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> forth at the window they ſhewed him the houſe, where the late-come Giant had hidden himſelfe, and kiſſing theyr eſpouſed Lordes, tooke their leaue againe to auoyde ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Our Knights, after they had dined, with theyr ſwordes and Shieldes they went forth of the roome, demaunding of all the women they met, if there were any more Giants in the Iland, and they made aunſwere ſtill that there were none.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> feigning as if hee beléeued them not, went ſtraite to the houſe which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ladies had ſhewed him, where ſuddainly entring, he found the Giant, who (being wearie with his iourney) ſlept very ſoundly: without making any noiſe they bound him hands and feete, that when hee awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, they might menace him with death if hee kept not ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. So laid they him aſide in another Chamber, where none of the women ſhould come to him, &amp; at night brought him into their owne lodging, where they attended the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of their hurts, being daily viſited by the Ladies diuers times, giuing them further inſtructions from time to time, how with honour they might reach y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> height of their deſires.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Vr high reſolued Knights, had their hurts no ſooner healed, but a Barque put into the port, hauing in it the ſonnes of the Lordly Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, who came to delight them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with the Ladies, that the more contentedly they might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept them in marriage. But <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zato,</hi> who alwayes ſtoode as Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinell for the ſpeedier arming of themſelues vppon the Giants arriuall, hauing eſpyed the Barque a farre off, gaue the reſt of his friendes warning to prepare themſelues: then going all cloſely downe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Port, they ſtoode behind a ruined Cottage, onely to haue them come on land, leaſt by ſight of them they ſhould turne back againe, and thereby haue falne into ſuch manifeſt danger, as (with life) they could neuer haue departed thence.</p>
               <p>The two young Giants being landed, with tenne other in their company, hauing no other defence then their Shieldes, and huge long ſwords, they tooke toward the houſe where the Ladies were, which our Knights percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, boldly ſtept forth before them, ſaying. Friends, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther goe ye?

That ye ſhall ſoone know, replied <hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> and all (with their weapons drawne) went preſently againſt them.</p>
               <p>When the Giants ſawe themſelues ſo fiercely aſſailed, they ſtoode vppon their owne guarde, and deliuered ſuch ſtroakes, that our Knights hauing had good experience of
<pb facs="tcp:14347:277"/>
them before, right cunningly auoided them, and wounded them at their owne pleaſure, they hauing no ſkill in the vſe of their weapons. But yet our Knights were ſorry, for not bringing theyr Axes with them, which they had left aboue at their lodging, and might cauſe the Ladies thereby to be ſuſpected, if any one ſhould eſcape and get thether: but the reaſon why they brought them not along with them, was, that the other women in the houſe, imagining they went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad but to walk, ſhould not looke forth to eſpy y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Barque, and by their out-cryes haue hindered theſe other Giants from landing. Neuertheleſſe, ſo well they handled the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with their ſwords, that they wounded ſixe of theſe new come Giants, and they would haue fled, but that the two young Lordes cheerely encouraged them, with vndoubted hope of vanquiſhing their enemies.</p>
               <p>The battaile thus continuing, one of the bretheren, bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing runne by <hi>Franardo</hi> quite through the face, fell downe dead, and brake <hi>Franardos</hi> ſword hard at the handle, as hée fell mainly vppon his weapon: whereat the other Brother growing mad &amp; deſperate, caught <hi>Franardo</hi> in his armes, and by reaſon hee excéeded him in ſtrength, hee gotte him downe vnder him, and ſtriuing to open his Helmet, purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to kill him. <hi>Franardo</hi> beholding his owne extreame pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill, gript his enemie ſo ſtrongly by the bottome of his bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, as he (féeling his breath to faile him) let goe his holde, whereby <hi>Franardo</hi> tumbled him on his backe, and getting aloft vppon him, meant preſently to diſpatch him: but now hee was in greater hazzard then before, for two other Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, who had dealt with <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> very ſhrewdly, came running in reſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> came quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to aſſiſt him, who ſtepping betwéene them and his ſonne, receiued their furious blowes vppon himſelfe, till hee was

His aduerſary meruailing hereat not a little, &amp; reckoning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe paſt hope of life, beckned with his hand to <hi>Franardo,</hi> as deſirous to ſpeake with him: ſo ceaſſed the battaile, for thrée other of the Giants remaining aliue, hauing likewiſe noa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this admirable act, ſtept backe and held theyr handes, they being kinſmen to the Lord of the Ile.</p>

                  <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> going to the Giant that requeſted parley, ſpake thus vnto him.

It ſhal ſuffiſe me (quoth <hi>Dramuſiande</hi>) y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you binde your ſelues to me by faith and knighthood, to ſtand no further on his part againſt me. We will not meddle any more againſt you, replied the Giant, and made him ſollemne promiſe to keepe theyr word. Why then (quoth <hi>Dramuſiande</hi>) will I in ſuch ſort commend you to the great Emperour of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> as hee ſhall enrich you with larger poſſeſſions, then euer <hi>Tirſo</hi> could beſtowe on yée. The Giant proteſted, that as they woulde not pertake againſt <hi>Tirſo,</hi> ſo they woulde not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peache any courſe he could take, where by to compaſſe his owne determination.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> and his friendes were well pleaſed with this contract, to declare that they ſtoode in neede of no other helpe, ſo leauing theyr weapons with them, the Giants went to a place of theyr owne abiding, ſo farre remote from the lodging of our Knights, as they could not diſcerne when the young Ladies came to viſite theyr Lords. After this accord, they likewiſe returned to reſt themſelues, hauing vnderſtoode by theſe Giants, that it would be tenne daies before the arriuall of <hi>Tirſo,</hi> whereof they were very highly contented: not in regard of any dangerous hurts receiued, but becauſe they were much trauailed &amp; wearie, for which quiet reſt was the onely remedie.</p>
               <p>The Ladies ſtill prouided them of all neceſſaries, often accompanying them to theyr contentment, whereby the other Gianteſſes ſuſpitiouſly gathered, that they bore ſome fauouring inclination to theſe ſtrangers, expreſſing no ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row or griefe at all, for the ſlaughter of theyr friendes and kindred, but rather ſeemed enamoured of our Knights, which cloſely they concealed to themſelues, expecting daily the comming of theyr Lord.</p>
               <p>Our Knights hauing recouered their former alacritie of ſpirit, kept hourely watch on the Port, that when <hi>Tirſo</hi> came, he might not get to the Tower: becauſe the Ladies had enformed them, howe there was no poſſibilitie of euer ſurpriſing, or finiſhing the enchauntment, if hee in perſon

               <p>No ſooner was <hi>Tirſo</hi> (and ſeauen Giants more with him) come on ſhoare, but our reſolued Knights ſtept foorth againſt him, and without vſing any words at all, oppoſed theyr weapons boldly to withſtand him. <hi>Tirſo,</hi> who neuer was bard of his paſſage till this inſtant, angerly drew his weapon vpon our Knights, and lighting firſt vpon <hi>Forzato,</hi> made him tumble backward ouer and ouer. <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> would next haue dealt with <hi>Triſo,</hi> but his ſonne <hi>Franardo,</hi> doubting leaſt his Father (being weakened with the imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitie of age) could not ſtand againſt this luſtie, ſtrong, and ſterne Giant, vndertooke his place, beeing roughly wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commed for his preſumption with ſo rude a ſtroake, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt had ſmitten him quite out of breath, whereby hée ſoone perceiued, that if hee became the buckler but to fewe ſuch blowes, his life muſt be the concluſion of the bargaine.</p>
               <p>Héere-vppon, he ſmote at him ſtoutly with his Axe, and his Armour being but a weake defence againſt the blowe, hee gaue him a déepe wound, and made him ſtand off from approching ſo neere him, albeit whenſoeuer <hi>Tirſo</hi> aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red any ſtroake againe, he found it layd on with no meane proofe. <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> had thrée of the other Giants confron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him, and reſiſted them but with ſlender ſufficiencie: <hi>Almaroll</hi> and <hi>Forzato</hi> vndertooke the other foure, and well found that they had no loytering labour in hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14347:279"/>The Ladies looking foorth, &amp; ſéeing our Knights ſo hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly matched, began to growe iealous of theyr owne ſafetie, if <hi>Tirſo</hi> in the end ſhould gaine the victory, wherefore they ranne to the thrée other Giants, which had yéelded before to our Champions, who beholding the manifeſt perill they were in, knew not how to conceiue of their owne ſecurity, but held it for moſt certaine, that <hi>Tirſo</hi> woulde be moſt ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous to them, becauſe they had not yet ſtept foorth in his aſſiſtance. This terror in the Ladies much more augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by alleaging the paſſed cruelties of <hi>Tirſo,</hi> and how ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannouſly he maintayned his gouernment ouer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: which the ſooner incited them to ayde our Knights, to whom they came at a very narrowe ſtraite, for <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> was in ſuch extreamitie, that hardly he could ſupport himſelfe from falling, which <hi>Foſco</hi> perceiuing, cryed out aloude to him: Feare not my Lord <hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> for I will be better then my promiſe which I made to ye.</p>
               <p>Thus came the battaile to an equalitie againe, no doubt to the great vexation of <hi>Tirſo,</hi> ſéeing his owne ſubiects to pertake againſt him: but now was no time for threates or ſtearne ſpeeches, which made him therefore to fight y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more furiouſly, bringing <hi>Franardo</hi> to ſo many hazzards, as hee was very often in danger of miſcarrying, yet this impaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his prooued his owne hurt, for ſpending his vigour in furie and madnes, without any intermiſſion or reſpite for breathing, his blowes began to fall the more faintly, which <hi>Franardo</hi> making very good vſe of, and cherriſhing his own ſtrength by the others weakening, purſued him ſtill vppon ſo many aduantages, as the Giant beganne to deſpaire of victory.</p>
               <p>By this time had <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> ſo wounded his enemie in the breſt, that it was too late to call for a Chirurgion, and <hi>Foſco</hi> likewiſe hauing ſlaine his encou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trer, they came both to <hi>Tirſo</hi> ſighting with <hi>Franardo,</hi> to whom <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> ſpake in the Gréek tongue, that hee ſhould not at any hand kill the Giant, but practiſe howe to ſurpriſe him aliue, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, they ſhould neuer gaine the rule of the Iland.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="273" facs="tcp:14347:279"/>So, they thrée cirkling him round about, ſeuerally laide hand on him, and binding him faſt with two long chaines, which the Ladies had ſent them, made him paſt ability of any further reſiſtance. When the two Giants that fought with <hi>Forzato</hi> and <hi>Almaroll,</hi> ſaw the ſurprizing of their Lord, they fell to a very deſperate courſe of fight, becauſe they ſtoode hopeleſſe of any mercy, but <hi>Foſco</hi> ſpake in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to them. Forbeare my brethren this angry violence, and entertaine the kindneſſe of theſe Knights, which you ſhall finde euery way to your owne contentment.</p>
               <p>The Giants being ſore wounded and weary, vpon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of pardon, threw by their weapons and yéelded them ſelues: being receiued by our knights as reconciled friends, after which they led <hi>Tirſo</hi> to the Ladies lodging, where their wounds were reſpected with all helpfull meanes poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, &amp; <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> had the charge of looking to <hi>Tirſo.</hi>

Iland, aunſwered: that hee was vtterly ignorant thereof, and maintained his ſpéeches very conſtantly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> preſently called for a fire, and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding certaine Tanackles or Pincers for torment to be put therein, threatned him with death in that manner, except he reuealed the enchauntment to him. The Giant, albeit he was of wondrous courage, yet when he ſaw ſuch ſharpe torments prepared, he began to grow fearefull, and ſayde. Now doo I well perceaue, that I muſt iuſtly reſtore what I haue wrongfully with-held: knowe then, there are two ſeuerall enchauntments belonging to the Tower, and they muſt be vnder-taken by two of you, wherein you will finde ſo hard a labour, as will coſt yée much ſweat before yée end it: yet when yée haue gone through all manifeſt perils, they are to no purpoſe, except ye can paſſe thorow the mouth of a Serpent, and iſſuing foorth at his vent againe, goe into a Garden of frightfull terrour, where obtayning the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of that place, both the enchauntments are fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> perceaued, that <hi>Tirſo</hi> knew no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the incantation, he tooke the booke out of his boſome, which his Aunt <hi>Eutropa</hi> the Enchauntreſſe had left him, and calling <hi>Franardo</hi> along with him, they went together toward the Tower. Being come thether, they behelde di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers Monſters looking through the battlements, and out at the gate iſſued a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

After this beaſt came forth a Knight with two heads, turning readily to one another euery way, ſo that without any vſe or winding of his body, they guided him whether ſo euer he pleaſed: foure armes had he beſide, and in each hand a very long ſworde. 2<hi>Franardo</hi> aduaunced him ſelfe againſt the Monſter, which one while ſmote him with his horne, and then againe ſo readily with his pawes, as he could not deuiſe how to auoide the blowes: and his ſword ſerued him but to ſmall purpoſe, for hee ſmote as if it had béene on a flint wall, without any
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:14347:280"/>
appearance of the beaſts féeling the ſtrokes. <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> buckled with the Knight, beeing ſtill ſmitten with two ſwords at once, and as he ſought to ſhunne the other two, the Monſter gaue him ſuch a blowe on the backe with his foote, as made him reele ſtaggeringly betwéene the Knights armes, and he being but of common ſtature, caught him vp from the ground, running ſo lightly with him into the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, as if his cariage had béene of an Infant. <hi>Franardo</hi> ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Father thus caried away, purſued him preſently, and notwithſtanding the Monſters reſiſtaunces, followed the Knight into the Tower, which cloſed againe in ſuch ſtraunge manner, as there appeared no gate at all for paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Franardo</hi> ſawe him ſelfe thus encloſed, he ſmote at one of the Knights ſwords, where-with hee laboured to wound his Father, and immediatly it fell out of his hand, whereby he perceaued, that the power of the Knight con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in his ſwordes, becauſe by beeing diſpoſſeſſed of this one, hee was not ſo furious as before, and beſide, <hi>Dramu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiande</hi> was againe at liberty, fighting couragiouſlie with the beaſt, yet ſéeing no likely meanes howe to ouercome him.</p>
               <p>Wherefore hee turned vppon the Knight, and in little while depriued him of two more of his ſwordes, whereby his vigour was much enféebled, and beeing ſoone after robd of his laſt weapon, the Monſter wexed in like ſort diſabled, becauſe they helde a ſimpathie of courage, and as the one weakened, ſo the other in like manner followed, both run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning away into an obſcure place, where our Knightes would not purſue them, leaſt therein conſiſted ſome ſecret trecherie. Standing ſtill to ſee what would enſue héere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they ſawe a great Barrell come tumbling downe a payre of ſtaires, ſéeming by the ſounde to be full of armed men, and ſo ſoone as it was on the grounde, it preſentlie opened, where-out there iſſued tenne Huntſ-men, with as manie Houndes in ſeuerall leaſhes, and rounding our two Giants as in a ring, they let ſlip their dogs all at once,
<pb facs="tcp:14347:281" rendition="simple:additions"/>
then drew foorth ſhort ſwords hanging by their ſides, and ſmote ſo fiercely at <hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> as hee was in very great hazard of his life: for beſide the hard vſage of theſe Hunters, two of the doggs had got him faſt by the arme, and another had bit in ſunder the laces of his helmet, ſo that his helmet totterd looſely vppon his head. But hauing recourſe to his wonted valour, he behaued him ſelfe in ſuch maner, as ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his arme, hee threw off the two dogges againſt the wall, and the other ſtanding vpright againſt his breaſt, he caught him faſt by the throate, and had quickly ſtrangled him, if two of the Hunters and the other doggs had not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him, for they comming fiercely againe vpon him, ſet him very hardly, and both the men and dogges were ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die about him, as he could not faſten one ſtroke vpon them. <hi>Franardo</hi> hauing all the reſt on him, had hardly eſcapt them, but giuing a thruſt by chaunce at one of the doggs mouthes, he perceaued him to giue backe and meddle no more with him, where-vpon, ayming his ſtrokes in like manner at the other doggs, they ſtill fell off from him, as expreſſing where their cheefeſt power conſiſted.</p>
               <p>But now the Hunters did him the greateſt iniurie, and as yet he had not found the meanes to endamage them, nor how the enchauntment ſerued to defend them: yet at laſt, ſmiting one of their Hattes beſide his head, hee ſawe him ſtagger backward, and declared no willingnes to aſſayle him againe. Theſe ſo fortunate accidents, did highly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage both the father and the ſonne, ſo that by wounding the dogges in the mouthes, and vnhatting the fierce Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters one after another, they were in the end depriued of any further reſiſting, and ſwallowed vp in a wide opening of the ground: out of which gulffe there preſently came foorth, a beaſt hauing two Serpents bodies vnited together, from the very loweſt parts vp to the heads.</p>
               <p>This Monſter leapt betwéene the two Giants, &amp; moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp toward their faces, breathed foorth ſuch an horrible ſmell, as they by no meanes could endure it: and although they laid on the beaſt luſtily with their ſwords, yet all their
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:14347:281"/>
labour was ſpent but in vaine, and ſo they might haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued God knowes how long, without any better ſucceſſe of their paines: had not <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> ſuddainly puld the booke out of his boſome, where he ſaw the ſame Monſter fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured with two Giants, who hauing the two heads in their hands, ſéemed eaſily to wreſt them euery way, where-vpon he ſtept to his ſonne <hi>Franardo,</hi> and ſhewing him the figure, they gaue ouer further contention, awayting opportunity to get néere the Monſter, which when they had compaſſed, each of them caught a head in his hand, and writhed it as the picture had directed them.</p>
               <p>Vpon this good hap, they felt an earthquake ſo ſuddaine and terrible, as they diuers times imagined the Tower would haue falne flat vpon them, for all which terrour they would not let looſe the Monſter, but held faſt to try the end of this meruaile. Then ſawe they the earth to open where they ſtoode, and after thrée or foure mighty blaſts of winde, a huge Dragon came vp out of the ground, which cloſing quickly againe vnder it, the Dragon caried them into a déepe darknes, where they felt them ſelues in a ready bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten way, whereof the booke had before giuen them ſome en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, &amp; that it would guide them to a Pallace, where they ſhould perfectly conclude the aduenture.</p>
               <p>Going on ſtill in this comfortleſſe darknes, they often ſmote their heads &amp; ſhoulders againſt a ſtonie wall, which made them to hold their hands before them, for feare of bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing or hurting their faces, and hauing béen aboue an houre in this obſcurity, at laſt they beheld a glimmering of light, but could not diſcerne from whence it procéeded, albeit ſtill the further they went on, the light encreaſed &amp; grew grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. At laſt they came to an open dore, wherein they beheld a very ſplendant light, which ſéemed to them as if it were the Sunne: but a wondrous great Serpent obſcurde the beames thereof with his wings, which extended forth in a meruailous breadth, and by their often moouing vp and downe, they cauſed the twinckling light which at firſt they beheld.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14347:282"/>This Dragon was of ſuch wonderfull highnes, as tenne great Giants might eaſily ſtand vpright in his belly: his mouth he held continually gaping, and thence iſſued foorth likewiſe a ſhining brightnes, and in faire large letters was engrauen on his head theſe words, <hi>THE SERPENT OF THE SVNNE.</hi>

               <p>This beeing doone, hee appointed that <hi>Foſco</hi> ſhould goe with his Ring and a Letter to the Caſtel of the Vale, there to commaund a Nephew of his named <hi>Oralio,</hi> to bring his Souldiours with theyr wiues &amp; children, and poſſeſſe theyr dwelling in that Iland, aſſigning them the goods and lands of the deceaſſed Giants.

                  <pb facs="tcp:14347:285"/>
the Knight of the Sunne. Comming to the Tombe, they found it open, and in it lay the ſhape of an Emperour, but couered with ſuch an arteficiall veyle, as they could not perfectly diſcerne his face. But <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> well noating the forme of his body, imagined it to be the Emperour <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maleon,</hi> as indeede it was: for the ſkilful Magitian, when he ſaw the aduenture was accompliſhed, to ſhun his owne ſhame, conuayed thence the Image of <hi>Alexander</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great, and placed this other in ſtedde thereof, but couered in this manner, as lothe to haue it eaſily knowne. <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> and the reſt, grew very penſiue, that the death of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour was ſo neere, as by a manifeſt ſigne they perceiued, namely the vncouering of the Tombe, being hourely rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to receiue him.</p>
               <p>In this griefe they parted thence, and within foure daies arriued at <hi>Forzatoes</hi> Caſtell, wherof he hauing before ſent his Siſter warning, found her moſt rich and gallantly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couſtred, entertayning them with the greateſt honour that could be deuiſed: and taking <hi>Franardo</hi> by the hand, right friendly kiſſed &amp; embraced him, but with ſuch a reuerend modeſt baſhfulneſſe, as added an admirable luſter to her beautie, whereupon <hi>Forzato</hi> ſaide vnto her.

               <p>The next day following, <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> thinking each houre a yéere till he were at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> would needs ſet onward, <hi>Franardo</hi> taking <hi>Grandonya</hi> along in his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, which ſhee earneſtly laboured, as willing to goe with
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:14347:285"/>
him through any perrils whatſoeuer, and very glad alſo of the other Gianteſſes company, becauſe ſhee ſhould haue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of her ſtature, to aſſociate her in the Grecian Court. No ſooner was dinner doone, but they mounted on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, and pleaſantly rode toward <hi>Constantinople,</hi> beguiling the time with much delightfull conference, and ouertaking <hi>Fortenbracio</hi> by the way, they iournied together the more merily.</p>
               <p>Now it fortuned, that the Giants of the Iland, whom <hi>Franardo</hi> led as priſoners to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> had ſecrete talke together, &amp; intended to murder our Knights in their ſléepe, which when they ſhould haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſed, they meant to put on theyr Armour, becauſe themſelues had none, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to doe what other miſchiefe they might. And this vile intent had taken effect, but that <hi>Dorina</hi> happened among them, ſhee trauailing likewiſe to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> to be at the marriage of young <hi>Primaleon.</hi> Shée riding awhile along with them, and ſtedfaſtly looking vpon thoſe Giants, found by her Arte the trechery of theyr thoughts, and feigning as if ſhee would talke with <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> concerning <hi>Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon,</hi> bad him haue an eſpeciall care of the Giants his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, becauſe they purpoſed treaſon againſt him and his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany. Then <hi>Dorina</hi> cauſed two angry Lyons to appeare before them, againſt which beaſtes as thoſe Giants ſtroue to defend themſelues, they were preſently torne in péeces, without any preiudice or offence at all to any of the other, and thus was the damnable drift of the Giants vtterly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed, the Lyons ſpéedily vaniſhing no man wiſt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>No ſooner was this ſtorme thus paſt, but onward they gallopped, vntill they came ſome-what néerer to <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> where a far off they were deſcried by theyr huge ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, eſpecially <hi>Franardo,</hi> who excéeded his father in height aboue thrée foote: wherupon, diuers ran haſtily to the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, ſaying, that a ſquadron of Giants were comming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, which made euery man preſently to arme him ſelfe, and make out for reſiſtance of theſe Giants. <hi>Arguto</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14347:286"/>
béeing firſt in readines, becauſe hee was newly returned from hunting, was the formoſt man that left the Citty, and meeting with <hi>Franardo,</hi> who wore an embroidered gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ouer his Armour, which his wife had giuen him as a loue-token, &amp; made him the more vnknowne to the Knight of the Sunne: But <hi>Franardo,</hi> albeit he knew him well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, was diſpoſed to breake a Launce with him, the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to make ſome proofe of himſelfe, with what abilitie he could endure the ſhocke of this braue gallant, who was rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned among the very choiſeſt Knights of the <hi>Grecian</hi> court. When hee behold <hi>Arguto</hi> to giue ſignall of the Iouſt, hee gaue forth to méete him, and the encounter was ſo violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly performed, as both of them loſt their ſtirrops, <hi>Franardo</hi> catching hold by the maine of his horſe, to ſheeld him from falling, and <hi>Arguto</hi> ſome-what diſorderly ſhouldred aſide: but, which moſt diſpleaſed him, beeing vnable to rule his horſe, he ranne with him till he came to <hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> who perfectly knowing him, receiued him in his open armes, ſaying: My Lorde <hi>Arguto,</hi> you come againſt your louers and friends.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arguto</hi> knewe <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> and <hi>Almaroll</hi> as they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced him, at which inſtant came thether <hi>Palmerin</hi> and <hi>Florian,</hi> who turning to the other with <hi>Franardo,</hi> after ſome ceremonious complement, <hi>Franardo</hi> ſayde. I am taught (my Lord <hi>Arguto</hi>) how to iouſt with any man that I haue no knowledge of. Nay, quoth <hi>Arguto,</hi> I may much rather ſay ſo my ſelfe, as knowing the ſufficiencie of your high merrit. Salutations and curteſies beeing ended betweene the Knights, they then affoorded like kindnes to the young Gianteſſes, whoſe beauties were aunſwerable to theyr greatneſſe in ſtature, and riding on to the Citty, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour had tidings of theyr arriuall, who albeit he was much crazed in body, yet would hee needes be carried along in a Horſe-litter, and meeting with the Giants, very ſollemne reſpects of affabilitie paſſed betwéene them, eſpeciallie to <hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> whoſe faith and loue to the race of <hi>Palmerin,</hi> had beene truly approoued.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="280" facs="tcp:14347:286"/>Afterward, he embraced his ſonne <hi>Franardo,</hi> beeing at large acquainted with his worth and valour, whereof had been ſo late a tryall, in his hardie meeting with the Knight of the Sunne. The Emperour next gaue welcome to the Ladies, and like one that had wiſhed well to ſuch beauties in his daies, kiſſed theyr fore-heads, cauſing them to ride on each ſide his Litter, taking them ſeuerally by the fayre hand, and vſing ſpéeches of much gentlenes to them: but to <hi>Grandonya</hi> (exceeding the reſt in comely features) he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed very princely kindnes, all the Ladies highly extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling their fortunes, to be ſo graciouſly entertained by the Emperour, of whom they ſtoode before in great awe and terrour.</p>
               <p>In this ſollemne ioy they entred <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come to the Pallace, they were roially welcommed by the Empreſſe and the other Princeſſes, all ſhewing great ioy for the health of <hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> but <hi>Arlencea</hi> taking her huſband and <hi>Franardo</hi> by the hand, went into the midſt of the Hall, where kiſſing them ſeuerally very often toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, all the reſt laughed hartily at them, the like did <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digea</hi> to <hi>Almaroll</hi> and his Lady. Within few dayes after, the Emperour helde a ſollemne feſtiuall, the eſpouſed La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſitting at the Table with theyr deere affected Lordes, and the other young inamoratoes, praying for the like ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe in their loues: all eyes beeing bent on the delicate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour, of <hi>Primaleon</hi> toward his <hi>Victoria, Arguto</hi> to <hi>Concordia, Tarnaes</hi> to <hi>Fior-nouella, Oliuanto</hi> to <hi>Auriana,</hi> and the reſt of the ſweete conſorted couples, whereof wee will ſpeake more in the enſuing ſtory.</p>
               <p>Dinner beeing ended, a dauncing was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the newe married and enamoured, wherein all the Court tooke very great contentment: the Gianteſſes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring as much ciuilitie, as if they had beene there trained vp all theyr life time, and the Emperour ſent for very coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Iewels he had, which he beſtowed on the Ladies of the <hi>Profound Ile,</hi> becauſe they were not acquainted with ſuch courtly deckings.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14347:287"/>Now did his Maieſtie thinke it very neceſſary, to make a publique ſollemnitie for all theſe mariages together, that his Court might be the more renowned therby: but <hi>Aliart,</hi> to whoſe iudgement theſe occaſions were moſt of all refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, told his Highneſſe, that they muſt ſtay the comming of the Princeſſe <hi>Targiana,</hi> as alſo of King <hi>Edward</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> who were in good forwardneſſe on their iourney thether: which newes were not a little pleaſing to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole Court, but eſpecially to Prince <hi>Florian,</hi> who ſtoode in doubt leaſt <hi>Corcuto</hi> had commenced his warre, and thereby endange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his beloued Ladie. According as <hi>Aliarte</hi> had before pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, ſo within foure daies after, newes came from the Hauen to the Pallace, that Ships of ſundry Nations were put into the Port: and a ſecond meſſenger openly deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the landing of the Princeſſe <hi>Targiana</hi> and King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> both of them riding in royall manner to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Citty.</p>
               <p>The young Prince <hi>Primaleon,</hi> becauſe the Emperour was weake and aged, cauſed all the Lordes and Ladies of the Court to mount themſelues, that ſo great ſtates might haue ſome entertainement aunſwerable to their high mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and ſo they rode in royall equipage to meet them, where <hi>Florian</hi> encountring his faire wife <hi>Targiana,</hi> gaue her moſt gracious and louing welcome, as all the Lords and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes in like manner did, reioycing greatly in her noble preſence. Then went they to King <hi>Edward</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and did him ſuch dutie as his woorth deſerued, in regard of the great eſteeme he bare among them, and eſpeciall fauours heeretofore from him receiued: hee not a little glad at the ſight of his ſonnes, and they as iocond to behold their king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Father.</p>
               <p>Béeing alighted at the Pallace, the olde Emperour, for ioy of his youths-partner in Armes, ſwounded twiſe or thriſe downe right, and much a-doe had they to kéepe life in him: ſo that betweene theſe two extreames, gladneſſe for the view of ſo long abſent friendes, and ſadneſſe for feare of looſing the Emperour, they could ſcarce containe any indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:14347:287"/>
meaſure, till the heate of either was more moderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie appeaſed, and the violence of ſuch paſſions in better ſort calmed. Within few dayes after, a Councell was called, to deliberate on matters concerning <hi>Targiana,</hi> who hauing ſeene into the practiſes of her Sonne, was come thether to prouide for future dangers of warre, not doubting but to finde her huſband in the Court of <hi>Constantinople.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Barons and Lords of the Kingdome being aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled together, <hi>Targiana</hi> declared before them, that all hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theneſſe drew to the faction of <hi>Corcuto,</hi> becauſe he had ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borned many princes of <hi>Turkie,</hi> to beleeue his right claime to that gouernment: which ſince hee could not with quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe compaſſe, hee meant to ouer-runne it with warlike troupes, not doubting but his owne people woulde cleaue vnto him, and iuſtly beare Armes againſt his Mother, for marrying the murderer of her huſband, and receiuing bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme among the Chriſtians, then which (in his mind) ſhée could not haue doone a déede of more indignitie, whereof he would be reuenged euen to the vttermoſt.</p>
               <p>She told them beſide, that hee was backt by a mightie troupe of Giants, deriued from the progenie of <hi>Darmaco,</hi> who was ſlaine by the valiant <hi>Palmerin d' Oliua,</hi> and they were very bloodily minded, hating all the iſſue and friends to the ſaid <hi>Palmerin.</hi> Héereupon he had prepared the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Fleete that euer was ſeene at Sea, with reſolute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, that if any man amongſt them ſhoulde but talke of turning backe, till they had vtterly rooted out the name of Chriſtians, hee ſhould ſuffer the extreameſt death that could poſſibly be deuiſed: and what Prince ſoeuer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing entred with him into this confederacie, that offered to ſhrinke from the courſe intended, all the reſt were to holde him as a hatefull enemy, and immediatly to turne theyr weapons vpon him, puniſhing him all one as if hee were a Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Targiana</hi> had at large deliuered her minde, with no little admiration of the Emperour and all els preſent: euerie man was entreated to ſpeake his oppinion, and to
<pb facs="tcp:14347:288"/>
helpe this dangerous caſe with the beſt aduiſe hee could. <hi>Florendos</hi> perſwaded them by many good reaſons, to leuey an Armie ſpéedilie, and aſſaile the enemy at home in his owne prouinces: all the young Knights iumpt with his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, but <hi>Palmerin, Florian</hi> and <hi>Aliarte</hi> held the contrary, alleaging, that an Armie of ſuch ſufficiencie would not be eaſily gathered, as might ſerue to beate the Pagans with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their owne dominions. Then <hi>Aliarte</hi> turning to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther King <hi>Edward,</hi> deſired him to ſpeake what hee thought moſt expedient, becauſe his long practiſe in war, and graue experience, could not but yéeld them the pregnanteſt courſe héerein to be taken.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Edward</hi> replyed, that the counſell of <hi>Florendos</hi> was ſo good, as it no way deſerued checke or reprehenſion, and that of <hi>Palmerin</hi> was very expedient, from both which grounds, there might be an abſolute courſe determined on. But firſt of all hee aduiſed, to prouide for <hi>Florians</hi> beſt ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the ſtate, who with his people of <hi>Thrace,</hi> and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ayde of <hi>Blandidon,</hi> Soldane of <hi>Niquea,</hi> might well maintaine that part of <hi>Turkie.</hi> And, quoth hee, this Court (God be thanked) affoordes young gallants enowe, to vnder-goe a farre heauier burthen then this, <hi>Oliuanto</hi> and <hi>Fortenbracio,</hi> they may haue the managing of theſe affaires. Héere are beſide of our déere louers and friends, the Giants ſo latelie come from the Ile of the bottomleſſe Lake, let them foure be imployed in ſome other méete place, with promiſe of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable recompence for theyr paines, giuing each of them a Citty in the Kingdome of <hi>Paraz,</hi> falne now to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, by the reuolt and death of <hi>Dyrdan,</hi> alwayes prouided, that no iniury be any way offered to <hi>Blandidon,</hi> but vppon his good ſucceſſe in this glorious enterpriſe, to haue the reſt of that Kingdome vnder his commaund.</p>
               <p>When things are thus eſtabliſhed abroade, then may ye leuey an Armie, according as your prouiſion by Sea ſhall require, and though not conſiſting of multitudes, yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with ſo many generous &amp; dauntleſſe ſpirits, as may cope with an Armie of farre greater ſhow: and thereof let

Lord <hi>Florendos</hi> be Generall, chooſing to him ſuch graue conſorts, as himſelfe ſhall thinke beſt of, and may fitteſt be ſpared from my Lord the Emperour.
