            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </gap>isque suo sensu abundat,</hi> so let him reflect and censure of this at his pleasure.</p>
            <p>The Observator, pag. 1. saith, <hi>That power is ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally inherent in the people, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this the answer is, that power is in God <hi>primariò &amp; per se,</hi> according to that of the Apostle; <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. and in the King or peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but onely <hi>secundariò &amp; derivativè</hi>: Power or Dominion is not a gift of Nature, that is to say, naturally inherent in us; for if it were, then might all men have equall power, for that by nature we are all equall; but power is a gift of God to Nature, and is <hi>gratia gratis da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi>; and yet power is congruous in nature, as was the power of King, and office of Priesthood in <hi>Melchisedec</hi>: for surely he had them both given, or appointed to him by God, being by interpretation <hi>King of Righteousnesse, and King of Peace, Heb.</hi> 2.7. And therefore it is not likely that he usurped to himselfe the Regall title of King, no more then he did of being Priest; and yet it was very probable that it was also agreeable in Reason and Nature, and although not tyrannicall, yet peaceable Kingly reigne, and sacred Priesthood did fitly belong to him:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Seth</hi> and his genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion began first to call upon the name of the Lord, that is to say, to give to God some set forme of worship, as Priests did, &amp;c.</note> for he is by most Divines thought to have been <hi>Sem,</hi> the eldest sonne of <hi>Noah</hi>; and by the law of Nature, of <hi>Moses,</hi> and of most Nations, the eldest is to inherit; so that what was the right of <hi>Adam, Seth,</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> might belong unto him by birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, although it may be God confirmed it unto him extraordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But to returne, power and dominion is derived from God, and congruous in Nature: but the power is in the people onely, when they are absolutely free to chuse to themselves what forme of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment they please, as were the Jewes before they subjected them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to Kings, being formerly freed from the bondage of Egypt by the finger of God. The <hi>Romanes</hi> when they erected their Senate
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47063:2"/>
and Consuls, having rebelliously (for it was no better) shaken off the yoke of Kings. The <hi>Venetians,</hi> when they first instituted their Common-wealth. But in Monarchies, where the people have been brought into subjection, either by the sword, as in <hi>Turky, Persia,</hi> and the like; or by innate, and prescribing, and prevalent authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as in <hi>Florence</hi>; or by both, as in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Castile</hi>; in these Dominions power is not inherent in the people, but in the Prince. And although some hereditary Monarches are more limited then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as is the King of <hi>France</hi> more then the great <hi>Turke,</hi> and the King of <hi>England</hi> more then the King of <hi>France</hi>: yet is their power derived immediately from God, and inherent in themselves, not in the people: for those limitations are (in conquered Nations) but mere donatives of grace, proceeding from the Prince or his Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors to the people, touching certaine immunities and priviledges; so that the Prince his power is the efficient cause of them, and such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities or priviledges are but as materiall effects. Now as it is most improper to say, that the effect should cause his owne cause, so is it to say, that a priviledged people should cause the Princes power, or that <hi>Power should remaine originally in such a priviledged people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some Nations elect their Kings, or Princes, and restraine them far more by conditionall inaugurations, then hereditary Monarches are, or ought to be restrained or limited: Yet have not such Nations power in themselves totally, but onely partially; that is, they have power to conditionate with their Kings or Princes, how farre forth they will be subject, and by what Rules they will be governed; but they have not power to conditionate with their Kings or Princes, that they will only be subject at their owne pleasures, and as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves shall thinke good; that is to say, if they please at any time to assume more liberty unto themselves, and to alter and disanull former Constitutions of Government, that they may do it without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of their Kings or Princes. This they cannot doe without trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to their Crownes or Diadems: For although the persons of such Princes be elective, yet is their power permanent, <hi>jure consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuto Coronae</hi>; which though they claime not as from progenitors, yet are they invested therewith as from Predecessors. And therefore being enthroned, they enjoy their dignities by prescription; that is to say, what belonged to their Predecessors; belongeth in the same manner to them, being once invested; nor can such Nations revolt from their elected Princes, without being reputed Rebels.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:47063:3"/>
Now of this nature are the Kings of <hi>Poland, Hungary,</hi> and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (to speake nothing of the Duke of <hi>Venice,</hi> for he is meerly titula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and a cypher) and such Kings first and principally claime their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from God the author of all power, who enspheareth them in the Orbe of dignity above others.</p>
            <p>And secondly, they acknowledge it from the generall consent of the Nation, which made choyce of them, and over which they rule. And surely such was the right and title of <hi>Saul,</hi> the first King of Israel: for he was appointed by God, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9.17. then anointed by <hi>Samuel,</hi> Chap. 10. v. 1. afterwards approved by the people, <hi>ibid.</hi> vers. 24. And finally, confirmed in his Kingdome, Chap. 11. vers. 14. And in the same manner was <hi>David</hi> likewise established in his Kingdome; so that their first and chiefe claime was immediately from God, and their second from the consent of the people. Nor is it of any consequence to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge, as the Observator seemeth to inferre, <hi>pag.</hi> 1. that those Kings had an extraordinary Institution from God; and therefore they might more lawfully claime their right, as appointed and appropriated to them by God. For to such Allegation it will be answered, That <hi>there is no power but of God, Rom.</hi> 13. So that whether God institute Kings by extraordinary, or ordinary meanes, it maketh no matter. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David</hi> were instituted extraordinarily by Gods spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall appointment; yet most of the Kings of Judah and Israel reigned afterthem but by ordinary succession; had they not therefore the same power that <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David</hi> had? Surely the Scriptures tell us they had. The Priests and Prophets in the old Law had an extraordinary vocation, especially the Prophets: the Priests or Ministers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell have but an ordinary vocation, are they therefore defective in power to those of the old Law? or have they not their vocation from God, because they have not extraordinary calling? Surely no. For how could Sacraments be administred, and the word preached? So is it with Monarchs: For though they have but ordinary succession; yet is their power immediately from God. Our Soveraigne is a free (though in some things a limited) Monarch, and derived therefore his power immediately (not mediately, as do other inferiour Ministers of justice) from God. And as touching limitations and priviledges, they are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else (as is aforesaid) but acts of grace conferred on this Nation by His Majesties predecessours in severall ages, and at severall times, and some of them lately by His Majesty himselfe, as the continuation of this present Parliament, the abolishing of the Starre-Chamber, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47063:3"/>
High Commission censures, and the like. But these priviledges, and others granted to the subjects, dis-invest the King of no primary, or Birth-right-royalty, but onely oblige him in honour to observe them as covenants. A Lord purchaseth a Mannor for himselfe and his Heires for ever; his sonne and successors grant certaine Franchises to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, and oblige their heires for ever to performe them: so the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants live-in a more free state and condition, then they did in the first purchasers dayes; and paying their rents, and performing their services, they are not altogether subject to be turned out at the pleasure (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther displeasure) of the Lord; but doth this Franchisement or freedome of theirs, cause the Lord to derive his right or title from his tenants? Law and experience tels us no. And this is our Soveraignes case; The Conquerour by his sword, or by deed of gift, or rather indeed by both, came in as a purchaser of the Kingdome of England, for himselfe, and his heires for ever, and by the Law of conquest had power to have made greater alteration in the State then he did, and to have induced what forme of government he had thought good, even as the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> hath done in <hi>Navarre,</hi> and the <hi>West Indies</hi>; yet hee did not, but onely imposed some hard things, as the having of Lawes in the French tongue, which the people generally understood not, <hi>Cover-fue-bell,</hi> and the like: his successours afterwards did immune, and ease the people from such grievances, so that they lived, and live at more liberty, and enjoy more securely their liberties and properties. But do therefore such immunities granted to the people, cause the King to derive his power and right from the people? The Lawes and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes of all Nations and Kingdomes that live under Monarchs, tell us no. The ancient and present Monarchies of the world being sufficient witnesses thereof, besides the <hi>Dictamen</hi> of Scripture, and reason alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy inserted.</p>
            <p>The Observator, <hi>pag.</hi> 2. saith, that it is an errour in some Princes, <hi>to strive more to be great</hi> over <hi>their people, then</hi> in <hi>their people.</hi> It may be some Princes have committed such an errour; but withall let the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servator take notice, that it is convenient for a free Prince to be both; that is to say, to have them wealthy, and yet obedient Subjects: for if he be onely great <hi>in</hi> his people, and not <hi>over</hi> them, hee may resemble the now Roman, or German Emperor, or the ancient Kings of France, the one whereof is daily in danger to be dis invested by commotion, &amp; combinations of his Princes; the other were heretofore almost con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually molested by factions of their Peeres and people: And sure the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47063:4"/>
French themselves have greatly occasioned the heavie burthen of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers tributes and impositions which they undergoe: for they ever and anon rising in Armes against their King, gave him occasion to enslave them the more by his reconquering of them, or reducing them into his obedience, so that had they subsisted in due allegiance, 'tis likely their King had been as equally great <hi>over</hi> as <hi>in</hi> them; which equality, or parity in government, is (no doubt) the most happy and blessed co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union that any Prince and people can enjoy.</p>
            <p>The Observator telleth us in the same page, that the King, though he be <hi>singulis major,</hi> yet he is <hi>universis minor.</hi> But why so? The Head Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall is not only <hi>singulis,</hi> but also <hi>universis membris majus dignitate,</hi> (though it may, 'tis not so <hi>in universis,</hi> as shall be by and by declared) For the Head hath in it selfe all Senses, other Members receive from it, but Feeling only, and Motion; the head governeth and directeth the whole Body, and is therfore in dignity more Noble then all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Body considered together: and yet though it be more noble and excellent then them all; (for as much as Motion and Feeling dimane from the Braine, which is in the head, to them all) notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing <hi>in universis,</hi> in all things, or faculties, the head is not more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent then all the members; for the Heart is the seat of Life (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to most Philosophers) being <hi>primum vivens, &amp; ultimum mori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens,</hi> and from it proceedeth naturall heat; the stomacke likewise admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistreth sustenance, and aliment; the Feet goe, and the Hands worke, and without them the head cannot subsist, yet are they all subordinate to the Head: and even so is it, or ought it to be in the body politicke, unlesse we must beleeve the Observator, who in his 19. <hi>Page</hi> saith, That <hi>the Head Politicall receives more subsistence from the Body then it gives, &amp;c.</hi> But by his leave, if priviledges and Immunities are (as they are) matters of Grace, proceeding from free Monarchs (for of such the Treatise is) to the people, do not such Heads give as much subsistence to the body Politicke, as they receive from it? The Observator telleth us, <hi>Pag,</hi> 6. That <hi>Edward the first was the first</hi> (whether he were, or not, it is not materiall) <hi>that repaired the Breaches which the Conquest had made upon this Nation</hi>; if so, did not hee, by such his reparation, give as much subsistence to the Common-wealth, as he received from the Common-wealth, or Body Politicke? And do not his Successors give likewise as much as they receive, when they conferre the like acts of Grace? Surely, hee that considereth rightly <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and all
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47063:4"/>
other Priviledges and Immunities, which now extend to the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne people of this Kingdome, will finde them first to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the Grace and Grant of our Kings: and therefore it is improper to say, That <hi>the Head Politick doth not give as much sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence to the Body Politick, as it receives from it.</hi>

            <p>The Observator saith likewise in his second <hi>Page,</hi> That <hi>id quod efficit tale, est magis tale</hi>; meaning thereby, that the people con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring, as the efficient cause, Power on the King, have joyntly more Power in themselves.</p>
            <p>It hath been shewed already, that free Monarchs, such as our King is, derive not their power from the people, but immediately from God: But suppose our King did secundarily acknowledge his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er from this Nation's generall consent; as it may be, the King of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> doth acknowledge his power in part from the Aristocracie of that Kingdome; and as <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David</hi> did in part from the <hi>Jewes</hi> approbation and consent: notwithstanding, it followes not from hence, that the people are the sole efficient cause of the Kings pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but onely the secundary and partiall. Now, when it is said, that <hi>id quod efficit tale, est magis tale,</hi> it is to be understood of entire and totall causes; but in this case, the people being at the most but the partiall cause of the Kings power, the Axiome or Rule faileth: as for example, the Moone being of her selfe a body darke, receives her light (at least-wise her chiefest) from the Sunne, as from an entire cause; the Sunne is therefore truely said to be more light, being the totall subordinate cause of light; in this case therefore it is truely said, <hi>id quod efficit tale, est magis tale:</hi> but the Sunne, <hi>mediante ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, producit hominem; &amp; mediante Leone, Leonem; &amp; mediante Plantâ Plantam</hi>; for that the Sunne affordeth to all sensible and vegetable creatures an influx of vigour and naturall heat: yet for as much as the Sunne is, in the production of these creatures, but a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall, and not an integrall cause, it were absurd to say, that the Sunne were more a man, then is a man; or more a Lyon, then is a Lyon; or more a Plant, then is a Plant: and so is it to say, that because a King may acknowledge his power in part received from the peoples generall consent, that therefore the people have more power then himselfe.</p>
            <p>The Observator telleth us, <hi>Page</hi> 3. That <hi>the Kings dignity was erected to preserve the Communalty, the Communalty was not created for his service.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:47063:5"/>
This is somewhat too harsh, especially if we consider our King to be, <hi>in all Causes, as well Ecclesiasticall as Civill, next and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under Christ, supreame Head and Governour</hi>: such words would have beene better accommodated to a Duke of <hi>Venice,</hi> then to a King of <hi>England.</hi> The <hi>Jewes,</hi> I beleeve, when they asked a King at Gods hands, were somewhat inclining to the Observators opinion; for they desired a King for their owne ends, chiefly to judge them, and to fight their Battailes; not well considering, that if they had a King, hee must and ought to have a Kingly Dominion over them: Wherefore God caused the Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi> to instruct them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Praeeminence of a King; and, that if they would have a King, a King would be such, and such a man, as is evidently chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cterized in the first of <hi>Samuel, chap.</hi> 8. where amongst other things, <hi>vers.</hi> 17. the Prophet saith, <hi>He will take the Tenth of your Sheepe, and yee shall be his servants</hi>: Where, by the word <hi>will,</hi> he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Authority which Kings would have; and by the word <hi>shall,</hi> hee sheweth the obedience that Subjects should have: nor did the Prophet speake of some, or to some few onely; but of all, and to all the people, (at least-wise to all the chiefest of them) saying, <hi>Yee shall be his servants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I desire therefore that the Observator, and all his other adherents, would take more speciall notice of this Text of the Prophet, and that of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> confirmation of this Text, <hi>Let every soule be subject to the higher Powers:</hi> For, though Christian Monarches ought not, by the Rules of Christianity, to Tyrannize, or make our Sonnes their Slaves, or our Daughters their Concubines, and the like; as did many of the Kings of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and some of the <hi>Jewes</hi>; yet ought they not to be thought so contemptible, as that the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty was no way created for their service.</p>
            <p>The Observator saith in the same Page, <hi>That the right of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest cannot be pleaded to acquit Princes of that which is due to the people, as the authors and ends of all Power; for meere Force cannot alter the course of Nature, and frustrate Law; and if it could, there were more reason why the people might justifie Force to re-gaine due liberty, then the Prince might to subvert the same.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the Observators leave, for his first Clause it is answered alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, That in Monarchies the people are not the authors or ends of Power. For the second Clause, <hi>That meere Force cannot alter the course of Nature, or frustrate the tenour of Law</hi>; that is to say, That
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:47063:5"/>
meere Force cannot captivate and debase a people by nature free, and living under a law of common consent. I suppose the words, <hi>cannot alter,</hi> should have beene, <hi>cannot, de jure, alter; or ought not to alter, &amp;c.</hi> For that force can alter, and <hi>de facto</hi> hath altered the freedome and lawes of People and Nations, is knowne to most men; Histories and Chronicles testifying to the world the severall altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and formes of Government which Conquerours have induced; but whether they ought so to have done, is a question. Yet should the Observator and his adherents take advice, that though in Nature there is a parity of mankinde, and therefore Dominion may not seeme to be intended by Nature, yet God the author of Nature, fore-seeing the fall of Man, and the depravation in Nature, which did ensue thereof intended power and dominion, and that some should bee masters, and others servants; some command, and others obey; some should become slaves to Tyrants, others subjects to free Monarches; others members of popular Estates: and these things God hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by his divine wisedome according to his will, and disposes and alters them at his pleasure: <hi>But as for the pot, it ought not to say to the Potter, Why hast thou made me thus?</hi> It is enough for it to know, that there is no power but of God, and so to be applyable to the use it was made for; if for honour, to honour; if for servility, to servility; being subject <hi>for conscience sake: Rom.</hi> 13.5.</p>
            <p>Of a strange nature therefore are those words, viz. <hi>There were more reason why the people might justifie force, to re-gaine due liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, then the Prince might to subvert the same.</hi> If this Doctrine had beene good, our Saviour would surely have counselled the Jewes (when they asked him whether it were lawfull to give tribute to <hi>Caesar</hi>) to have kept their money in their purses, or to have made up a stock of it, and by force to have sought to re-gaine their due li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty from <hi>Caesar,</hi> and not have bid them <hi>Give unto Caesar what is Caesar's.</hi> If it be alleadged, that in case Christ had counselled the <hi>Jews</hi> so, they would have played the <hi>Jews</hi> indeed, and have accused him of high Treason: What then? Would Christ have concealed, or did he at any time conceale the truth for feare of the <hi>Jewes</hi> accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations? When he was conjured to expresse whether or no he were the Sonne of God, (a thing more hatefull to the <hi>Jewes</hi> eares, then the denying of tribute could have beene to the eares of the <hi>Romans</hi>) Christ answered, <hi>Thou hast said it</hi>; which is as much as <hi>Yes.</hi> But
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47063:6"/>
suppose the <hi>Jewes</hi> would have accused him of high Treason, in case he had denied tribute to <hi>Caesar,</hi> and that God would not have such a vile imputation as Treason laid on the Redeemer of the World: Yet had re-gaining of due liberty by force beene lawfull, Christ might have said, <hi>Yee may give tribute to Caesar,</hi> in the Potentiall Mood, (in which words no exceptions could have beene taken) and not have said, <hi>Give tribute to Caesar,</hi> or <hi>Give unto Caesar what is Caesar's,</hi> in the Imperative Mood. Or otherwise, when they asked him, <hi>Whether it were lawfull to pay tribute to Caesar,</hi> he might onely have answered them, <hi>Yes</hi>; but fore-seeing in his divine wisedome, that some indirect constructions might bee made of such a single word as <hi>Yes,</hi> 'tis lawfull to pay it, yee may pay it if yee please, 'tis not against the law of God, if yee doe pay it, &amp;c. therefore Christ bid them shew him a piece of money, and bid them <hi>Give it unto Caesar,</hi> informing the covetous mindes of that perverse people, that they ought and were obliged to part with their money and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance to <hi>Caesar,</hi> if demanded as a tribute. But to let Arguments of Divinity passe, and to induce a few State reasons: <hi>If the people may justifie force to re-gaine due liberty,</hi> what Monarchy, what Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy, what Popular estate can remaine secure? The <hi>French</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects being in generall oppressed with taxes, may revolt from their King, if this Tenet be good; and so may the <hi>Spanish</hi>: The <hi>Polish</hi> Peasants may rebell against the King and their Lords, for that they hold them in villinage: and the Townsmen and Boores in <hi>Holland,</hi> and the Pisani in <hi>Venice</hi> against the States, for their imposing on them terrible excizes. This Tenet, or Position, may quadrate, it may be, with the <hi>Irish</hi> Rebels, (for they pretend by force to re-gaine due liberty) but never with loyall subjects. And surely this Tenet, or Position afore-said, is dangerous to all the Monarchies and States of the world, yea, even to Parliaments themselves, if rightly conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and opposite also to the law of God and Nations.</p>
            <p>The Observator telleth us, <hi>Page</hi> 13. That <hi>where the people by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like authority will seeke an inconvenience to themselves, and the King is not so much interested as themselves, it is more inconvenience to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it, then grant it.</hi> This is a strange assertion, and against all rule of Monarchicall Government. Suppose (for a supposition is no falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie) that a Christian people should generally (which God forbid) desire to revolt from Christianity to Mahometanisme; should their
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:47063:6"/>
King grant it? they seeme to be more interessed then the King, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it concernes their salvation or damnation; is it injustice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to deny it? Surely no; but most just and acceptable to God to hinder them from it. Suppose this Nation should in generall (which God of his goodnesse prohibit) desire to turne Anabaptists and Brownists, whereof there are too many already; is the King bound, or ought he to condescend to their desires? Surely no: but as Gods Vice-gerent, to oppose such exorbitant inclinations of the people. But if the Assertion of the Observator be good, <hi>Pilate</hi> seemes to be excuseable, whom the Observator condemneth in the page before: for the <hi>Jewes</hi> sought by authority of the Priests and Elders to cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie Christ, (an inconvenience enough to themselves) and instanced a law, and that <hi>by that law he ought to die, Joh.</hi> 19.7. and the <hi>Jewes</hi> were more interested in Christ, (he being their Countrey-man, and subject to their lawes, as they conceived)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then was <hi>Pilate</hi>; so that according to this Assertion of the Observator, <hi>It was more inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience and injustice for</hi> Pilate <hi>to have denyed to the Jewes</hi> Christ <hi>to have beene crucified, then to have granted it.</hi> Judica Deus.</p>
            <p>The Observator saith, <hi>Page</hi> 17. <hi>The name of a King is great, I confesse, and worthy of great honour; but is not the name of a People greater?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Observator must give me leave to tell him, that in Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies, where there were or are Kings, the name of a people neither was, nor is greater then the name of a King: <hi>Senatus populúsque Romanus,</hi> ceased to be, and gave place to the name of <hi>Caesar.</hi> The <hi>Ottoman</hi> name at this day, dignifies that great Empire subject to that family; and so doth the name of <hi>Sophy</hi> the Persian. The name of the House of <hi>Austria</hi> decorates their dominions; and so doth that of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> France: And I see no reason but why the name of <hi>Stewart</hi> should doe as much in England. If it be asked, But what availeth the names of these great Monarches, without their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes or Dominions? The answer is, That Dominions are to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narches, as it were, materiall subjects; themselves (from whom their names result) as Formes. Now as the Forme is more worthy then its Matter, so is a free Monarch more worthy then his Empire, in respect of dignity politicall.</p>
            <p>And indeed the word Monarch inferres as much; for Monarchy is derived from <hi>Monarch,</hi> not Monarch from Monarchy. But
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47063:7"/>
it may be some will instance from hence, that if it be so, the good of a Monarch seemes to be preferred before the good of all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in generall, so that a whole Kingdome or Empire should bee utterly pillaged, wasted, and consumed, rather then his Treasures be destroyed. Not so: for though Empires and Kingdomes are but as materiall subjects, and Monarches as formes politicall; yet even as in nature, formes cannot subsist without matter, (from whose pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er all formes, except the rationall soule, are educed;) so in policy, Monarchs cannot subsist without their people, from whose subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and obedience their power is educed immediately from God, as are formes from matter by nature: the good of both therefore must be consistent together, so that not <hi>salus populi</hi> alone, as the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servator</hi> would have it, but <hi>salus Regis &amp; populi,</hi> is the true end of Monarchicall government.</p>
            <p>Thus have I briefly answered the Observators chiefe arguments, from whence all his other assertions and conclusions are drawne, desire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him and all others, rather to study how to produce reasons for obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience (where it is due) to Monarchs, then to derogate from Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicall government: to endeavour how to incline, and not to disaffect (by nice positions) the distracted mindes of the people towards the King: to propound prudent Arguments which might move the King to accommodate with his Parliament; and not by lessening his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to divert him from it. Finally, to seeke how to unite the King and Common-wealth, and not to dis-unite them by impertinent and inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid conclusions. God of his goodnesse grant co-union (as much as in this world may be) betweene our Soveraigne and His people, that He may know truely how to rule, and they to obey.</p>

If they may declare that for a Law, a fundamentall Law, which never yet was exacted, or had any being; and deny the plaine undoubted Lawes that have beene Enacted, or frustrate them by some unheard of interpretation, (as if such interpretation had been some mentall (or rather Parliamentall) reservation, laid up within the Parliament wals, to be produced upon emergent occasions, by their Successours) they will have so full an Arbitrary power, that the right and safety of King and People must wholly depend upon their Votes. Which power can never be safe, either for King, or People, nor can they produce one president that may warrant such a Power.

He might have said as truly, That Oathes are not binding to them: and therefore neither Statutes, nor presidents, But the <hi>Observator</hi> tells us (<hi>Pag.</hi> 44.) That the Oathes of Supremacie and Allegiance are not endangered, by making the Kingdome, &amp; not the King, the proper subject of power. And he yeelds reason for it. <hi>For</hi> (saith he) <hi>hee that ascribes more to the whole Vniversality, then to the King, yet ascribes to the King a true Supremacie of Power and Honour above all particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</hi> I wonder what he meanes by a true Supremacie of Power and Honour above all particulars: Surely he meanes nothing but priority
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:47063:8"/>
of place, and height of Title; for hee is allowed little power over some particulars, namely, over the Members of either House, and whom else they please to exempt (as they did Serjeant Major <hi>Skip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon</hi> for his Power and Commands.) But this distinction helpes them The Members of either House are sharers in that Supremacie which is in the Universality and above his; and by the power of that Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie they can exempt whom they please from the power of this, Inferiour (pardon the phrase, and the absurdities cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest without a Solecisme) Supremacie. Very good: but in good so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber sadnesse, doth the <hi>Observator</hi> thinke this distinction was thought on by the Framers and enjoyners of that Oath, or that the Members of the House, at their entring the House, did take their Oath to the King, as to the Supreme over all, with exception of themselves, or reservation of an higher Supremacy to themselves, when they should be entred? It is hardly credible: Nor do all (that desire to tender all due honour to the Parliament) beleeve that they are so the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sality, or the Kingdome, as the <hi>Observator</hi> presumes. They are trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Universality and Kingdome, and we pray, that they may discharge that trust, not knowing, but that a multitude of men sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject (every one of them) to errour, may faile in their judgement, and being not exempted from the common condition of the sinfull Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> may possibly, not rightly discharge the trust committed to them, as well as the King, who is blasted with foule failings and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, in judgement. Me thinks, men that so much detest Popery, should not borrow the grounds of their reasoning from them: and I shall as soone beleeve the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> telling us that they are the Universall Church, and therefore cannot possibly erre, as that the Parliament is the Universall, unerring, and unpervertibly just body of the Kingdome. And surely, the Spirit of declaring must needs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side in a strangely large measure in them, who have power thus to declare, not onely Law, but Oathes too: a greater, then which the Popes flatterers never gave him: and hardly ever any Pope assumed so great: <hi>Quo te constringam mutantem Protea nodo?</hi> How shall these men be bound to do right, who so easily untie the knots of these sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred bookes of Law and Oathes? why, yes: There is a bond that will do it; The obligation of the Justice, and honour of a Parliament. But can any man be sure, that they whom neither Law, Custome, &amp; Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidents of their Ancestors, nor Oathes can bind, will be alwayes held
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:47063:9"/>
in by the obligation of Justice and Honour? Is it not possible that they may (in time) finde a power in themselves of declaring that obligation void, as well as they have done the other? The same obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Justice and Honour, is as strong upon Kings, (and hath ever beene held more powerfull and obstrictive in them, then in any State mannaged by a Community;) and yet they dare not trust His Majesty, though so obliged. The <hi>Observatour</hi> then must pardon me, if I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, they may rather be held in, (and hold themselves so to be) by the old obligations of Law, Presidents, and Oathes, rather then that the Kings liege people should be put wholly to confide to that single obligation of the Justice and Honour of a Parliament.</p>

               <p>HIs Majestie sets downe this Position in more words, but these are much to the same purpose; and upon these the inference which His Majestie makes, followes undeniably, That then the life and liberty of the subject, and all good Lawes made for the security of them, may be disposed of, and repealed by the major part of both Houses at any time present, and by any wayes and meanes procured so to be; and His Majestie shall have no power to protect them. They see nothing that see not the misery which may follow upon such a vast transcendency of arbitrary power, if it were invested in the Parliament, which (I dare boldly say) was never claimed by any Parliament, though in conjunction with (the head of it) the King. Every (the meanest) Subject hath such a right and propriety in his goods, that without Law they cannot bee taken from him, though to be employed for the publike good. And though the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the people be the highest Law, and that doe (many times)

give a power above other Laws, and against them, to the supreame Magistracy in a State, to dispose of private mens estates, yet the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable rule of Justice must have place, even in that highest Law, and that requires a compensation to be made to those, whose estates or goods are so disposed of; and never gives power to uphold the publike good with private injury.

Yet I know not well what he meanes by deserting the King: if hee meane it in that sense, which he doth the Kings deserting of them, which (out of question) is his not assenting to whatsoever they shall thinke fit; Then in reason they should not, by their disallowing all his Proposals, have driven him to dissent from theirs, and so to have deserted them. Well: But being deserted by the King, when the Kingdome is in distresse, they may judge of that distresse, and relieve it. All their power then is upon supposition of the Kings deserting them: So that if it appeare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that His Majestie hath not deserted them (as many good men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve He hath not, in the redresse of any reall grievance,) then they have no such power. And however, they claime this power onely when the Kingdome is in distresse; But how if the Kingdome be not in distresse, or (at least) that distresse be only or principally cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by their claiming of that power, which cannot consist with the Honour and Royall Estate of His Majestie, which all men (by their late Protestation) are bound to defend? If it be so, wee may easily discerne how farre they may stretch this power, which they claime onely in order to distresse; and that they may make as much use of it, as the Pope doth of his power in temporals; <hi>In ordine ad spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualia.</hi> He claimes no more, (though some have said he hath right to more;) and the Parliament will need no more, to doe as much as he takes upon him to do with Christian Princes and States. But they must have a right to their power in this case of distresse; Whence have they that? why, they have it as the whole body of the State, and that they are, and must be so accompted, by vertue of represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Very good. But let us consider his words a little more. There is no understanding man, but must and will acknowledge (unlesse he
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:47063:10"/>
wilfully derogate from them,) that the Parliament represents the body of the State, for those ends for which they convene, as an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour doth the Prince that sends him, in the mannage of that bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse for which he is sent: But this is not an absolute representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to all intents and purposes. Besides, whom doe they represent? The body (saith he) of the State. Be it so: but it is onely the Body without the Head. And if they were not by representation onely, but really, the whole body of the People (if it were possible they should convene together) they are all but an assembly of Subjects, of men to be governed, not to rule; to be commanded, not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand their Head and Soveraigne: and then there can be no virtue of representation that can advance them to the power, which the <hi>Observatour</hi> ascribes to them, when such power was never in the whole Body, which is represented. No? never such power in the whole body? I know the <hi>Observatours</hi> stomack will rise here. Did not the Peoples consent at first make Kings, and conveigh pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er into their hands? Truely Sir, not solely: but grant it, what then? Marry,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 2.</note> he saith, then it is a principle in nature. <hi>Quicquid efficit ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, est magis tale</hi>; In <hi>English,</hi> If the People make a King, they are more King themselves; or if they give power, they have more power: and may resume and exercise that power when they please. Excellent learning, and well applyed; I beleeve hee learn'd this piece from <hi>Suarez</hi> the Jesuite. But the <hi>Observatour</hi> may know, that that rule admits many limitations; and surely, it holds onely <hi>in cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis totalibus,</hi> which the People are not in the constitution of Kings. But suppose their consent did at first give power to Kings; when their consent is given for them and their Successours, to a King and His Heires, can the succeeding people cut off the entaile, and retract the consent their Ancestours have given? By what right? with what justice? I know not: but the people may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract for them and their Successours in the conveighance of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne power, (if ever they had it in their hands to give) as any man may in the conveighance of his lands or goods: and that such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighance may be as binding to Successours in the one, as in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and then I am sure they cannot have power at all times, and in all succeeding ages, to resume what they have so given. Our Kings right (so far as it is derived from the people) is of this kinde. And if he had no other grounds for his claime of Soveraignty, (as it is most certaine that he hath) such a consent once granted, were sufficient
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:47063:10"/>
to binde the people, that it cannot ever be lawfull for them, by a major part of them, (comming in with a <hi>Nolumus hunc regnare su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per nos</hi>) to deprive him of that right. But surely, they would never make so absolute a grant of their power to Princes, as to devest themselves of it. Good Sir, shew me that proviso in their grant. But it seemes to you unnaturall they should:<note place="margin">

               <p>HIs Majestie infers upon this Position, <hi>That himselfe must be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to their Commands.</hi> This sounds but harshly in the eares of loyall Subjects. That any posture wherein they can be put, can raise Subjects to a capacity of Soveraignty, and reduce their Soveraigne to become their Subject. But hee comforts us here, and tels us, this power is not claimed as ordinary, nor to any purpose, &amp;c. This is but poore comfort: it is not, but it may be in good time, if they please. Hee doth not say, they shall not hereafter, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not claime it as ordinary, and to other purposes then that he names. So that there may be other causes that may make them claime this power, as well as this. But indeed they need no other, if it be in their power to declare that to be the case of the King and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome when they please: But they will never doe it, but where there is a just cause for it, and the truth leads them to it. Truly, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve honourably of the Justice and Wisedome of Parliaments; but I doe beleeve that they are not either infallible, or that they cannot possibly do amisse.

The King is seduced, that is, he is perswaded (by his owne understanding, and other evill Counsellours,) not to part with his Soveraignty, nor to become a Subject to his Subjects. He preferres dangerous men, (that is, such as would have him still to be their King.) persecutes his loyall Subjects, that is, such as would rule him, and the people at their pleasure.</p>

               <p>I Thought this Position so strangely Paradoxall, and so apparently contrary to reason, and common sense, that no man would have appeared in the defence of it. Yet this <hi>Observator</hi> never blushes, nor blinkes at it, but affirmes it stoutly. But for all that, I shall beleeve very slowly, That the Kings Person can at any time be without the King, or without his Authority: Or that they may destroy the Kings Person to preserve the King. My faith is not strong enough to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve these sublime points, and mysteries of State: I shall subscribe thus farre, That warre against the Kings Authority (though in the absence of his Person) is warre against the King: But that the King and his Person should be 'intwo places, will never (I feare) downe with mee. But however Ile see his reason: What's that? <hi>Why else the Parliament seeing a seduced King, ruining himselfe and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:47063:12"/>
could not save both, but must stand and looke on.</hi> Surely this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is full of weight, and ready to burst, it is so big with probability. I suppose the <hi>Reader</hi> understands his language here by my former glosse: But if we should take the words as they sound, the reason would seeme as strange, as that which it is brought to confirme. The King ruining himselfe, and his Kingdome, a mad King, or an Ideot (hee meanes) and then 'twere fit the Parliament appointed him a guardian. <hi>Ruining himselfe and his Kingdome.</hi> Is it possible, that the King should ruine himselfe and his Kingdome. What? The King alone? Is he alone able to doe it without the people? It is hardly credible: If he have the people on his side, and a prevailing major party, I thinke the <hi>Observatour</hi> (standing to his own Principles) will not deny that he hath Soveraigne power with him, and that it is unnaturall to thinke the Community should destroy it selfe. But the Community (he will say) is to be lookt at in Parliament. Well, But good Sir, may not the people withdraw the power of representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which they granted to the Parliament; was their grant so abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, and so irrevocable, that they dispossesse themselves wholly of taking or exercising that power, in their owne proper persons? Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member your principles about the conveying of Soveraigne power into the hands of Kings; and if you can shew no better Cards for their power of representation, than the peoples revocable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, (and I would faine know why it should be more revocable from Kings than men) you will find their tenure in it very tickle.</p>
