            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

(hath an humble vilipending and dispri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing

to preuent and frustrate the exaltation of God.
Keepe thy selfe lowly as the Earth; reiect all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion

of their bodies: seeing here is all the difference
betwixt him that walkes, and his floore he walkes

                     <p>1. It is the property of <hi>Raine</hi> to coole heate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Experience tels vs, that a sweltring feruour of the
ayre, which almost fryes vs, is allayed by a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
shower sent from the clouds. The bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
heate of sinne in vs, and of Gods anger for
sinne against vs, is quenched by the Gospell. It
cooles our intemperate heate of malice, anger,
ambition, auarice, lust; which are burning sins.</p>
                     <p>2. Another effect of <hi>Raine,</hi> is <hi>Thirst</hi> quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched.
The drie <hi>earth</hi> parched with heate, opens
it selfe in refts and cranies, as if it would deuoure
the cloudes for moisture. The Christian soule
<hi>thirsts after righteousnesse;</hi> is drie at heart till he
can haue the <hi>Gospell:</hi> a showre of this mercy from
heauen quencheth his thirst: he is satisfied. <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
drinketh of the water that I shal giue him, shal
neuer thirst:</hi>

springing vp into euerlasting life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. <hi>Raine</hi> doth allay the windes. When the
ayre is in an vprore, and the stoutest Cedars
crouch to the ground before a violent blast; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
Towers and Cities tremble; a showre of
<hi>raine</hi> sent from the cloudes mitigates this fury.

God quiets all our feares, secures vs from al their
terrours by a gracious <hi>raine,</hi> droppes of mercie
in the neuer-fayling promises of the Gospell.</p>
                     <p>4. <hi>Raine</hi> hath a powerfull efficacy to cleanse
the ayre. When infectious fogges, and conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
vapours haue filled it full of corruption, the
distilling showres wash away the noysome putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.
We know, that too often filthy fumes
of errors and heresies surge vp in a land, that the
soule of faith is almost stifled, and the vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of corrupt doctrine gets a predominant
place: the Lord then <hi>droppes</hi> his word from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen:
the pure <hi>Raine</hi> of his holy Gospell cleanseth
away this putrifaction, and giues new life to the
almost smothered <hi>truth.</hi> Wo to them then that
would depriue mens soules of the Gospell, and
<hi>with-hold the Truth in vnrighteousnesse.</hi> When
they <hi>locke vp</hi> the gates of grace (as <hi>Christ</hi> repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
the <hi>Lawyers</hi>) and labour to make the <hi>heauens
brasse,</hi> they must needes also make the <hi>Earth iron.</hi>
How should the <hi>earth</hi> of mans heart bring forth
fruits, when the <hi>raine</hi> is with-held from it? No
maruell, if their ayre be poyson'd.</p>
                     <p>5. <hi>Raine</hi> hath yet another working; to mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie
a hard matter. The parched and heat-hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
earth is made soft by the deawes of heauen.
O how hard and obdurate is the heart of man, till
this <hi>raine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>falls</hi> on it. Is the heart couetous? no
teares from distressed eyes can melt a peny out of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:487:12"/>
it. Is it malicious? no supplications can begge
forbearance of the least wrong. Is it giuen to
drunkennesse? you may melt his body into a
dropsie; before his heart into sobrietie. Is it am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious?
you may as well treat with <hi>Lucifer</hi> about
humiliation. Is it factious? a Quire of Angels
cannot sing him into peace. No means on earth
can soften the heart; whether you annoint it with
the supple balmes of entreaties, or thunder a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it the bolts of menaces, or beate it with the
hammer of mortall blowes. Behold! GOD
showres this <hi>raine</hi> of the Gospell from heauen,
and it is sodainely softned. One Sermon may
<hi>pricke</hi> him <hi>at the heart;</hi> one droppe of a Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
bloud distilled on it by the Spirit, in the
preaching of the Word, melts him like waxe.
The Drunkard is made sober, the Adulterer
chaste, <hi>Zaccheus</hi> mercifull, and raging <hi>Paul</hi> as
tame as a Lambe.</p>
                     <p>They that haue erst serued the Diuell with an
eager appetite, and were hurried by him with a
voluntary precipitation; haue all their chaines
eaten off by this <hi>Aqua fortis:</hi> one droppe of this
<hi>raine</hi> hath broken their fetters; and now all the
powers of hell cannot preuaile against them.
There is a Legend, (I had as good say, a tale) of
an Hermite, that heard (as he imagin'd) all the
Diuels of hell on the other side of the wall, lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and blowing, and groning, as if they were
a remouing the world. The Hermite desires to
see them: admitted, behold, they were all lifting
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:487:12"/>
at a feather, and could not stirre it. The appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
may serue; yeeld the fable idle. Satan
and his Armies, Spirits, Lusts, Vanities, Sinnes,
that erst could tosse and blow a man vp and
downe like a feather; and did not sooner present
a wickednesse to his sight, but he was more ready
for action, then they for instigation; now they
cannot stirre him: they may sooner remoue the
world from the pillars, then him from the grace
and mercy of God. The deaw of heauen hath
watred him, and made him grow; and the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of hell shall not supplant him. The <hi>raine</hi> of
mercie hath softned his heart, and the heat of
sinne shall neuer harden it.</p>
                     <p>6 Lastly, <hi>Raine</hi> is one principall subordinate
cause, that all things fructifie. This holy deaw is
the operatiue meanes and working cause, next
vnder the grace of God in our Lord <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi>
that the soules of Christians should bring forth
the fruits of faith and obedience. I know, God
can saue without it: we dispute not of his power,
but of his worke; of ordinary, not extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
operations. God vsually worketh this in our
hearts by his word. Thus for the matter: the
manner is:

sayth the Apostle: <hi>Euery good gift, and euery

merit of congruity to draw it to them: they that
haue it, haue no merite of condignitie to keepe
it with them. It is the mercy and gratuitall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
of God, that this Gospell <hi>commeth</hi> to vs.
For, if <hi>ipsum minus</hi> be <hi>munus,</hi> how highly is this
great gift to be praysed! What deserue we more
then other Nations? They haue as pregnant
wittes, as proportionable bodies, as strong si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes
as we: and perhaps would bring forth bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
fruits. Yet they want it: with vs it is. Wee
need not trauell from Coast to coast, nor iourney
to it; it is come to vs. <hi>Venit ad limina virtus:</hi>
will you steppe ouer your thresholds, and gather
Manna? When the Gospell was farre off from
our Fathers, yet in them <hi>Studium audiendi supera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat
taedium accedendi:</hi> the desire of hearing it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled
the length of the way. But we will scarce
put forth our hand to take this bread: and, as in
some ignorant countrey townes, be more eager
to catch the raine, that falls from the out-side of
the Church in their buckets, then this <hi>raine</hi> of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:487:13"/>
grace preached in it, in their hearts. Oh you
wrong vs; wee are fond of it; we call for preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
yes, as your forefathers of the blind times
would call apace for holy water; yet when the
Sexton cast it on the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they would turn away their
faces, and let it fall on their backes. Let God sow
as thicke as he will, you wil come vp thinne. You
will admit frequencie of preaching, but you haue
taken an order with your selues of rare practising.
You are content this <hi>Raine</hi> should <hi>come,</hi> as the

sends vs a plentiful raine. One showre will
not make vs fruitful; it must come <hi>oft vpon
us. Gutta cauat lapidem, non vi, sed saepe cadendo.</hi>
The raine dints the hard stone, not by violence,

to <hi>line: here a little and there a little.</hi> God could
powre a whole floud on vs at once: but mans

                           </q>
Sayes the Poet. If much were powred at once, a

children, wee must bee fed by spoonfulls, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:487:14"/>
not an abundant raine falling at once, that makes
the plants grow; but kindly and frequent showers.
One sermon in a yeare contents some throughly;
and God is highly beholding to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if they wil sit

cause of <hi>Christ,</hi> but they will doe nothing for it
worth God-a-mercie. The world is full of good
wishes: but heauen only full of good workes. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

perceiue not when the faithfull take it; you may
see they haue it: for their fruits testifie it. It is a
most euident demonstration, that they haue bin
beholding to the Gospell; they haue a sanctified
life. <hi>Drinkes it in.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There bee very many great <hi>Drinkers</hi> in the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:487:16"/>
world. The maine drunkennesse, that giues de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination
to all the rest, is that throte-drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:
whereof the Prophet, <hi>Vae fortibus ad po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tandum.</hi>
These are they, that will not drinke this
mysticall wine in the Church, so willingly as bee
drunk in the tap-house. Wine-worshippers, that
are at it on their knees, protesting from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes
of their hearts to the bottome of the cups;
if the health be not pledged, <hi>actum est de amicitia:</hi>
farewell friendship. I haue read of a streete in
<hi>Rome,</hi> called <hi>vicus sobrius,</hi> sober street. Find such
a street in any Citie or populous towne in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
and some good man wil put it in the Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle.</p>
                        <p>It hath beene sayd, that the Germanes are
great drinkers; and therefore to Carowse is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to be deriued from them; the word being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally
to Gar-rowse, which is to drinke off all:
<hi>Gar</hi> signifying <hi>totum:</hi> so the Germanes are called
by themselues <hi>Germanni, quasi toti homines;</hi> as if a
Germane were <hi>All-man;</hi> according to another
denomination of their Country, <hi>Allmanie.</hi> And
so wee are growne to thinke him, that can tipple
soundly, a tall man, nay all-man from top to toe.
But if England plyes her liquor so fast as shee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins,
Germany is like to loose her Charter. I
haue heard how the <hi>Iesuits</hi> out-stripp'd the <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciscans.</hi>
Indeed Saint <hi>Francis</hi> at the first meeting
sawe sixe thousand Fryers. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> because he
could not begin his order with so many, made
vp the number in Diuels. The Germanes had of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:487:16"/>
vs both priority and number for drunkards. Our
English beggars first got the fashion: but because
their number was short, and it was like that the
Nation would be disgrac'd, it was agreed to make
it vp in Gallants.</p>
                        <p>No maruell, if the Lord for this threaten vs
with the rod of famine, and to scourge vs with
that most smarting string of his whippe. God
hath layd himselfe faire in his bow already, and
is ready to draw this arrow vp to the head, and
send it singing into our bosomes. <hi>Ferro saeuior
fames:</hi> it is one of Gods sorest iudgements.
Beasts and Sword kill quickly; and the Plague
is not long in dispatching vs: but Dearth is a lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring
death. <hi>Lament.</hi> 4.<note place="margin">Lament. 4. 9</note> 
                           <hi>They that be slaine with the
sword, are better then they that be slaine with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger:
for these pine away, stricken through for want
of the fruits of the field.</hi> We see how our seasons
are changed, because we can finde no season to
repentance. Our Springs haue bin graues, rather
then cradles: our Summers haue not shot vp, but
withered our grasse: our Autumnes haue taken
away the flockes of our sheepe. And for our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
Haruest, wee haue had cause to inuert the
words of our Sauiour, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.<note place="margin">Luke 10. 2.</note> Hee sayth, <hi>the
Haruest is great, but the Labourers are few: pray ye
therefore the Lord to send forth more Labourers into
his haruest.</hi> But wee might haue sayd: the <hi>Labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
are many, and the haruest is small: pray ye ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord to send a greater haruest for the Labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.</hi>
God hath thus, as it were, pulled the Cup
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:487:17"/>
from the Drunkards lippes; and since hee will
know no measure, the Lord wil stint him. If there
will bee no voluntary, there shall be an enforced
fast. Wee haue other great drinkers besides.</p>
                        <p>What say you to those that <hi>Drinke</hi> vp whole
townes, vnpeople countreys, depopulate villages,
inclose fields? that <hi>Pharise-like,</hi> swallow vp poore
mens houses, drink their goods, though mingled
with teares of damme and young ones, mother
&amp; children? Are not these horrible <hi>drinkers?</hi> Sure
God will one day hold the Cup of vengeance to
their lippes, and bid them <hi>drinke</hi> their fils.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Proud-man</hi> is a great <hi>drinker.</hi> It is not
his belly, but his back, that is the drunkard. He
pincheth the poore, rackes out the other fine,
enhanceth the rent, spends his owne meanes,
and what he can finger besides, vpon clothes. If
his rent-day make euen with his Silkeman, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,
Taylor, he is well. And his white Madam
<hi>drinkes</hi> deeper then he. The walls of the Citie
are kept in reparation with easier cost, then a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
face, and the appurtenances to her head.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Ambitious</hi> is a deepe-<hi>drinker:</hi> O hee
hath a dry thirst vpon him. He loues the wine of
promotion extremely. Put a whole monopoly
into the cup, and he will carouse it off. There is
a time when other drunkards giue ouer for aslee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping-while:
this <hi>drinker</hi> hath neuer enough.</p>
                        <p>Your grimme <hi>Vsurer</hi> is a monstrous <hi>drinker:</hi>
you shall seldome see him drunke at's owne cost:
yet he hath vow'd, not to be sober til his Doomes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daye.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:487:17"/>
His braines, and his gowne are lin'd with
foxe; hee is euer afoxing. It may be some infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
spirit hath put loue-pouder in his drinke; for
hee dotes vpon the deuill extremely. Let him
take heed; hee shall one day <hi>drinke</hi> his owne ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations
and they wil choke him.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Rob-altar</hi> is a huge <hi>drinker.</hi> Hee loues,
like <hi>Belshazzar, to drinke</hi> only in the goblets of
the Temple. Wo vnto him, he carowses the wine
he neuer swet for, and keeps the poore Minister
thirsty. The tenth sheafe is his dyet: the tenth
fleece (O 'tis a golden fleece he thinkes) is his
drinke: but the wooll shall choke him. Some
drinke downe whole Churches and steeples; but
the bells shall ring in their bellies.</p>
                        <p>Euery <hi>couetous worldling</hi> is a great <hi>drinker:</hi> he

like an absolute, dissolute drunkard, the more he
drinks, the dryer he is; for he hath neuer enough.
It may be said of him, as it was of <hi>Bonosus,</hi> whom
the Emperour <hi>Aurelian</hi> set to drinke with the
German Embassador; not a man, but a rundlet
fill'd with wine.</p>
                        <p>And my fine <hi>precise Artizan,</hi> that shunnes a
Tauerne, as the Diuell doth a Crosse, is often as
drunke as the rankest. His language doth not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
of the pot; he sweares not, but indeed: but
trust him, and indeed hee will cozen you to your
face. The loue of mony hath made him drunk.
And though the Prouerbe be, <hi>In vino veritas;</hi>
yet as drunke as he is, you shall neuer haue truth
break out of his lips.</p>

                           <pb n="28" facs="tcp:487:18"/>
And the vnconscionable Lawyer, that takes

If what is wanting in the goodnesse of the

                        <p>There is yet a last, and those a blest sort of
<hi>Drinkers:</hi> which <hi>drinke in</hi> this sweete <hi>raine</hi> of

so do the wicked. Verse 4. <hi>They haue tasted of the
heauenly gift: they haue tasted of the good word of
God, and of the powers of the world to come.</hi> 2. Nor
drinke it onely to their throat, as if they did gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garize
the word; as carnall Politicians, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall
Professors doe. They must attend, they
must admit, but no further then their throates:

                  <p>1. <hi>It brings forth.</hi> It is not barren like a dead
ground that yeelds neither herbes nor weedes.
This is no idle heart, that doth neither good nor
harme; that like a meere spectator of the world,
sits by with a silent contemplation for whom

<q>
                        <l>Here lyes he, was borne and cryed,</l>

                        <hi>Thus

When God will bring the Gospell, and with it

their <hi>barrennesse.</hi> So was it prophecied, <hi>Esay,</hi> 54.

The primordial praise of this good ground

Christian heart, doth 1. conclude thankfulnesse.
2. exclude idlenesse.</p>
                     <p>1. For the former; GOD hath giuen him
<hi>Raine</hi> for this purpose, that he should <hi>bring forth
fruite:</hi> if hee should take the <hi>raine,</hi> and not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
the senders hopes, he were <hi>vnthankful.</hi> The
good man considers the end why he receiued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
blessing, and examines what God meant in
conferring on him such a benefite. Hath God

I'may boldly affirme it: your couetous man

ordinarily to get to heauen. He riseth early, and
resteth late, and eates the course bread of sorrow:
and after tedious and odious miserie, goes to the
Diuell for his labour. Shall we refuse easier pains,
for a farre better recompence? It is but <hi>Satans</hi>
subtiltie, that makes men beleeue the passage to

Herein the Diuell doth like the inhospitable Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uages

mans nature, that pride, if it doth not prouoke
yet at lest holds the dore, whiles any iniquitie is
doing. Hence flow so many errors, and factions,
and singularities.</p>
                        <p>For as in the body, a raw stomach makes a rhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick
head, &amp; a rhumatick head a raw stomach.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:487:32"/>
So in the soule, an indigested conceit of some
good thing in vs, makes the head rume of some
rheumaticke opinion, or madde factious singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laritie:
and this petulant rheume in the braine,
keeps the conscience raw stil; that the physicke of
repentance, or good diet of peaceable obedience
cannot helpe it. Let vs correct these exorbitant
and superfluous conceits, which are like proude
flesh vpon vs; and knowe, wee are able to doe
nothing of our selues, but God is faine to put
euen good thoughts in vs. And if wee doe good
from him, how good soeuer it be as from him,
yet running through vs it gets some pollution.</p>
                        <p>Neither let vs run into the contrary errour, as
if in a stupid willfullnesse, what good soeuer wee
did, we could not hope that God in <hi>Iesus Christ</hi>
would accept it. There is a thresholde of des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire
below to stumble at, as wel as a post of high
presumption to breake our heads at. There is a
base deiection, a sordid humility. <hi>Bar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Iesuite told another of his order; that when the
deuill appeared to him one night, out of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
humility hee rose vp to meete him, and
prayed him to sitte downe in his chaire; for hee
was more worthy to sitte there then he. This did
appeare a strange kind of deiectednes. Surely
I thinke, a man should by Gods word and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
take comfort in his wel doing, and be chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in the testimonie which a good conscience,
on good cause beareth to him. So <hi>Dauid</hi> hartned
himselfe against all the malicious slanders of his
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:487:32"/>
his enemies; <hi>O Lord thou knowest mine innocence.</hi>
Good workes are the necessary and inseparable
effects of a true faith. We are by nature all dead
in sinne, and by sinne concluded vnder death.
Our Sauiour bore for vs this death, and by his
passion freed vs from eternal damnation. It was
not enough to scape hell, how shall wee get to
heauen? Loe, we are cloathed with the garment
of his righteousnesse, hung with the Iewels of his
merits. So not onely hell is escaped by his suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings,
but heauen got by his doings. Why
should wee then worke? what need our gardens
stand so full of <hi>herbes?</hi> Good reason. Shall
God do so much for vs, and shall we do nothing
for him, for our selues? If the Lord of a Forrest
giues me a Tree, it is fit I should be at the cost to
cut it downe, and bring it home, if I will haue it.
I cannot say that I deserued the tree; it was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
gift: but my labours must lead me to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy
that, which was freely giuen me. Neither,
can the conscience haue assurance of eternal life,
so frankly bestowed in <hi>Christ,</hi> without a good
conuersation. Faith doth iustifie, and workes do
testifie that we are iustified. In a clocke, the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of the dyall makes not the clocke to goe, but
the clocke it: yet the finger without shewes how
the clocke goes within. Our external obedience
is caused by our inward faith; but that doth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
how truly the clocke of our faith goes. As
a mans corporall actions of sleeping, eating, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesting,
walking, declare his recouery from sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:487:33"/>
and present health. So his life witnesseth
by infallible Symptomes, that the disease and
death of sinne is mortified in him, and that he
hath taken certaine hold of eternall life. It is
meet then that we should doe good workes: but
all our works are made <hi>meete</hi> and worthy in him
that bought vs. I will conclude then with that
Antheme, made by a sweet singer in our <hi>Israel.

The way to make our herbes smell sweetly, is
first to purge our <hi>garden</hi> of weedes. For if sinne
be fostered in our hearts, all our workes will bee
abominated. God heareth not the prayers of
the wicked.<note place="margin">Leuit. 26. 31.</note> 
                     <hi>If yee will walke contrary to mee,</hi> saith
the Lord, <hi>I will bring your sanctuaries vnto desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and I will not smell the sauour of your sweete o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours.</hi>
But being adopted by grace in Christ,
and sanctified to holinesse, our good works smell
sweetly, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.<note place="margin">Phil. 4. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>I haue receiued of Epaphroditus the
things which were sent from you, an odour of a sweet
smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well pleasing to God.</hi> It
seemes, GOD highly esteemes the <hi>herbe Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi>
in our gardens. Hee that serueth the Lord,
shall <hi>smell as Lebanon:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hos. 14. 6. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>hee shall growe as the

                  </p>
                  <p>Man is naturally delighted with pleasant sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours,
and abhorres noysome and stinking smels.
But our God hath purer nosthrils, and cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
the polluted heapes of iniquities. The Idle
man is a standing pitte; and hath an ill-sauour'd
smell, an ill-fauour'd sight. The drunkard is like
a bogge, a fogge, a fenne of euill vapours: God
cannot abide him. Your couetous wretch is like
a dunghill; there is nothing but rottennesse and
infection in him. <hi>Omnis malitia eructat fumum.</hi>
All wickednesse belcheth forth an euill sauour.
Wonder you, if God refuse to dwell with the V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer,
Swearer, Idolater, Adulterer? There is a
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:487:36"/>
poyson of lust, a leprosie of putrefaction in them:
no carryon is so odious to man, as mans impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
are to God. Yea the very oblations of defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
hands stinke in his presence.<note place="margin">Esa. 66. 3.</note>

a Lambe, is as if hee cut off a dogges necke, &amp;c.</hi>
As if <hi>Ass a foetida</hi> was the only supply of their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens.
But good <hi>herbes</hi> giue a double sauour: one
outward to man, another inward to God. The
sweete smoke of a holy sacrifice, like a subtil ayre,
riseth vp to heauen; and is with God before man
sees or smels it. It also cheares the hearts of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
to behold Christian workes. Reuerence
to the Word, hallowing the Sabaoths, releeuing
the poore, deeds of mercie, pittie, piety, giue a
delightful sent: solacing the soules of the Saints,
and pleasing him that made them both men and
Saints. Therefore <hi>Hearken vnto me, ye holy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eccl. 39. 13.</note>
                     <hi>and budde forth as a Rose growing by the brook
of the fielde. Giue ye a sweet sauour, as frankincense,
and flourish as a Lilly, send forth a smell, sing a song
of prayse, and blesse the Lord in all his workes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. That they <hi>taste</hi> well. Many a flower hath
a sweet smell, but not so wholsome a taste. Your
Pharisaicall prayers and almes smelt sweetly in
the vulgar nosthrils: <hi>taste</hi> them, and they were
but rue, or rather worme-wood. When the
Pharise sawe the Publican in the lower part of
the Temple, standing as it were in the Belfrey;
he could cry, Foh this Publican: but when they
were both <hi>tasted,</hi> by his palate that could iudge,
the Publican hath an <hi>herbe</hi> in his bosome, and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:487:36"/>
the Pharise but a gay, gorgeous, stinking weede.
The <hi>herbes,</hi> that the Passeouer were eaten with,
were sowre: yet they were enioined with sweet
bread. Sowre they might be, but they were whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some.
<hi>Herbes</hi> haue not onely their <hi>sauour,</hi> but
their nutriment. <hi>He causeth the grasse to growe for
the cattell,</hi>

may bring food out of the earth.</hi> Herbs the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are food,
and haue an alimentall vertue. So we may both
with the <hi>herbes</hi> of charitie feed mens bodies, and
with the <hi>herbes</hi> of piety feede their soules. A

The bloud of Martyrs is sayd to haue nourished
the Church. The patience of the Saints, in the

sinne, euer busie among good workes, like
a <hi>Iudas</hi> among the Apostles: let him looke
into this <hi>Garden</hi> for <hi>Hysop, Humility</hi> of Spirit. Of
which <hi>herbe</hi> it is written.</p>

                        </expan> suis radicibus haeret.</q>
                     <p>Let him be taught by this <hi>herbe,</hi> to annihilate
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:487:38"/>
his owne worth, and to cleaue to the Rocke,
whereout he growes, and whereof hee is vphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
IESVS CHRIST. Or let him produce the
Camomill, which smels the sweeter, the more it
is trodden on. <hi>Humility</hi> is a gracious <hi>herbe,</hi> and
allayes the wrath of God; whereas pride pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uokes
it. It is recorded of an english king, <hi>Edward</hi>
the first, that being exceeding angry with a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant
of his, in the sport of hawking, he threatned
him sharply. The gentleman answered, it was
well there was a riuer betweene them. Hereat
the King more incensed, spurr'd his horse into
the depth of the Riuer, not without extreame
danger of his life; the water being deep, and the
banks too steep and high for his ascending. Yet at
last recouering land, with his sword drawne, he
pursues the seruant; who rode as fast from him.
But finding himself too ill-hors'd, to out-ride the
angry King; he reyned, lighted, and on his knees
exposed his neck to the blow of the kings sword.
The King no sooner saw this, but he put vp his
sword, and would not touch him. A dangerous
water could not with-hold him from violence;
yet his seruants submission did soon pacifie him.
Whiles man flyes stubbornely from God, hee
that <hi>rides vpon the wings of the winde,</hi> postes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him with the sword of vengeance drawne. But
when dust and ashes humbles himselfe, and
stands to his mercie, the wrath of God is soone
appeased.</p>
                     <p>This Camomill or <hi>Hysop</hi> growes very lowe:
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:487:39"/>
                        <hi>Humblenesse</hi> roots downeward, yet no <hi>herbe</hi> hath
so high branches. We say, that proud men haue
high mindes: they haue not. For their mindes
only aspire to some earthly honours, which are
but low shrubbes indeed. The humble man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spires
to heauen, and to bee great in the eternall
Kings fauour; and this is the true, but good
height of minde. His desires haue a high ayme,
though their dwelling bee in the vale of an <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
heart. There are engines, that raise water to
fall, that it may rise the higher. A lowly heart, by
abasing it selfe in the sight of God and men, doth
mount al the other graces of the soule as high as
heauen; and the eye of mercie accepts them.
Pride is a stinking weede; and though it be gay
and garish, is but like the Horse-flower. In the
field it is of glorious shew: croppe it, and you
cannot endure the sauour. At the best, the proud
man is but like the bird of Paradise, or the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stridge;
his feathers are more worth then his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
Let not thy <hi>Garden</hi> be without this <hi>herbe Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie.</hi>
It may be least respected with men; and
among other <hi>herbs</hi> ouerlooked; but most accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to God. <hi>Respexit humilitatem ancillae suae,</hi>

of his hand-maiden.</hi> It shall not want a good
remembrance, a good recompence. For the last,

purpose cannot be eluded with impatience: and

regards not the highest but secondary causes:

The good Christian considers, that he hath the
goods of this world, to doe good in this world.
And that his riches are called <hi>Bona,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">August.</note> Goods; <hi>Non

that they make him a good man, but giue him

                     <p>He learns a Maxime of Christ from the world;
which the world teacheth, but followeth not;
that is, to make sure as much wealth as he can: as
if it were madnes, to leaue those goodes behind
him, which he may cary with him. This policie
we all confesse good; but faile in the consecution.
The world thinkes, that this assurance is got by

purchasing great reuenews, or by locking vp gold

he can; but hee thinks this is not the waie to do it.
He considers, that the richest hoorder leaues all

Therfore what hee must loose by keeping, he will
keepe by loosing: and so proues richer vnder

hee hoords vp; knowing it shall be surely kept,
and safely returned him. His Garden shall stand

the Gentlemans left side looked blacke,

pursuing his sports, he fell into a quarrell; where

that at a great Princes hands had the choise
of three vessels. One whereof should be freely
giuen her, euen that she should chuse. The first
was a vessell of gold, richly wrought, and set
with precious stones; and on it written. Who
chooseth me shall haue what he deserueth. The
second was of siluer. superscribed thus. Who
chuseth me shall haue what nature desireth. The
third was of lead; whose motto was this. Who
chuseth me, shall haue what God hath disposed.
The former pleased her eye well, but not her vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.
It offred what she deserued. She
knew, that was iust nothing: therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
it. The second considered, offred what
Nature desires. Shee thought that could
bee no solide good; for Nature desires
such things as please the carnall lust. This shee
also refused. The third had a course outside, but
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:487:52"/>
the sentence pleased her wel; offering what God
had disposed. So she faithfully put her selfe vpon
Gods ordinance, and chose that. This Virginis
mans soule. The golden vessell is the worlds ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;

chuse this: but being open'd, it was full of dead
mens bones, and a fooles bable. To testifie
them fooles, which cleaue to the world: and at

Neither is this all. Though <hi>their inward

shall feed on them.</hi> The siluer-vessell is the lusts of
the flesh; those fond and vaine delights, which
concupiscence seeks. So saith the Motto: It giues
what nature desireth: but corrupt nature affects
nothing, but what giues co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>placency to the flesh.
This vessell open'd was full of wild fire, and an i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron
whip. God shall scourge the lustfull here
with the whip of iudgements, diseases of body,
infamy of name, ouerthrow of estate, vexation of
conscience. And Satan shall hereafter burne
them in wild fire, such flames as can neuer bee
quenched. The leaden vessell is, as the sense &amp;

                     <p>The Virgin chose this, and she was married

betwixt good and euill men, or betwixt reward

which the Papists know so soundly, and beleeue
so roundly.<note place="margin">Mat. 13. 24.</note> For he sayes, In Gods <hi>Field,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer

<hi>herbes</hi> and <hi>weedes,</hi> had either the Master or the

                  <p>This first word of the Text, <hi>But,</hi> is a strong
engine set to the wals of Purgatory, to ouer-turne
them, and ouer-burne them with the fire of hell.
For they are imaginary pales, that diuide hell
and Purgatorie: take away your conceit, and
they are both one: all is hell. For surely hell
was raked, when Purgatory was found; and it is
nothing els but a larder to the Popes Kitchin.
What fancie soeuer founded it, their wittes are
foundred, that labour to maintaine it. For they
cannot tell vs, <hi>vel quid sit, vel vbi:</hi> what it is, nor
where it is. They cauill with vs for want of vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and consent in iudgement.<note place="margin">De Purgat. lib. 2. cap. 6.</note> Yet <hi>Bellarmine</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites

to vs in their times. Some thinke the
torments of it to consist in fire, others in water:
some that the afflicters are Angels, other that
they are Deuils. So they teach <hi>omni modo,</hi> that
which is <hi>nullo modo:</hi> and because it is <hi>vbique,</hi> is
therefore <hi>nullibi.</hi> Howsoeuer, it being the Popes
peculiar; and in his power to command the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
to fetch out whom hee list; mee thinks the
Popes are strangely vnmercifull, that in all this
time none of them hath made a generall Gaole-deliuerie.
But our Purgatorie is the blood of
<hi>Iesus Christ,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 1.</note> which <hi>clenseth vs from sinne.</hi> And
they that haue no portion in this blood shall be
<hi>reiected,</hi> are <hi>nigh vnto cursing,</hi> and <hi>their end is to

                  </p>
                  <p>The barren, or rather euil-fruited <hi>ground</hi> is
the ground of my discourse: and according to
the common distinction of <hi>Euill,</hi> here is a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>euill</hi> in the Text. <hi>Vnum quod malus facit, alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
quod malus patitur.</hi> An euill which the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
man doth; and an euill which he suffers: an
euill that is sinne, and an euill that is punishment
for sinne. In the former the wicked are agents;
in the latter, patients. The one euill is done by
them, the other vpon them. They offend Gods
iustice, and GOD in his iustice offends them.
They haue loued <hi>cursing, and cursing shall be vnto
them: they desired not blessing, and it is farre from
them.</hi> They produce <hi>Thornes,</hi> and the end of
<hi>thornes is to bee burned.</hi> The first and worst euill
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:487:57"/>
(for the other, though euill to them, is good in
Gods good Iustice) is sinne. Herein 1. the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
are compared to bad <hi>ground.</hi> 2. their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities
to <hi>thornes</hi> and <hi>bryers.</hi> 3. and the manner
how so ill weeds arise from this <hi>ground,</hi> is said to
be <hi>bearing. The earth that beareth thornes,</hi> &amp;c.
Here first obserue,</p>
                  <p>1 The different word the Apostle vseth. For
the good <hi>earth,</hi> hee sayes, it is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>bringing forth herbes.</hi> For the euill, it is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
<hi>bearing,</hi> not bringing forth. As if good workes
were brought forth like children, not without
paine and trauell: euill workes but cast out like
froth or skimme; as easily vented, as inuented.
Therefore the earth is said <hi>ebullire,</hi> to bubble or
boile out such things, as meere excretions. Our
prouerbe sayes, An ill weed growes apace. <hi>Herbes</hi>
grow not without preparing the ground, planting
and watring them by seasonable deawes and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence.
Weeds are common: it is hard to set
the foote besides them. The basest things are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
most plentifull. <hi>Plurima, pessima.</hi> I haue read
of a kind of mouse, that breeds sixe score young
ones in one nest. Whereas the off-spring of the
Lyonesse or Elephant is but single. You shall
find your furrowes full of Cockle and da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ell,
though you neuer sew them. The earth, sayth
the Philosopher, is now an own mother to weeds,
and naturally breeds and feeds them: but a step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother
to good herbes. Man by a procliuitie
of his own naturall inclination, is apt to produce
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:487:57"/>
                     <hi>thornes</hi> and <hi>bryers:</hi> but ere hee can <hi>bring</hi> forth
herbes, Graces, God must take paines with him.
No husbandman so labours his ground, as God
our hearts. Happy earth, that yeelds him an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
haruest. But that <hi>which beareth Thornes is
neere to be cursed and burned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2 Obserue, that a wicked man is compared
to bad earth, and that fitly in 5. respects.</p>
                  <p>1 For basenesse. The earth is the heauiest of
all Elements, and doth naturally sinke downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards;
as if it had no rest, but in the center; which
it selfe is. A wicked man is base-minded, and
sinkes with a dull and ponderous declination; not
regarding the things aboue, but these below. He
hath commune with men <hi>sursum os,</hi> but with
beasts, <hi>deorsum cor.</hi> All his affections haue a low
obiect, not out of humilitie, but base deiection.
His hope, desire, loue, ioy, are set on these inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
things: and like a Mole, he digs still downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
till he come to his Center, <hi>his owne place,</hi>
Hell.<note place="margin">Acts. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Telluris inutile pondus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2 For coldnesse. Experience teacheth that the
earth is cold; &amp; coldnes is a natural quality perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
to it, though accidentally there be bred in it
fierie vapours. The wicked man hath a cold heart,
frozen vp in the dregs of iniquitie; though there
be an vnnaturall heat sometimes flaming in him;
the fire of lust and malice tormenting his bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els:
but this is no kindly heate to warme his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.
That is deriued from the <hi>fire</hi> of the
Temple, that neuer goes out, and only giuen by
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:487:58"/>
                     <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> that <hi>baptizeth with the holy Ghost, and
with fire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3 For foulenesse. The squalid earth (for we
speake not heere of any good ground) is called
<hi>Lutulenta terra;</hi> miery and noysome: yet is it
neate and cleane in comparison of a sinne-conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
soule. The body was taken from the
earth; not the Soule: the body shall resolue to
the earth; not the soule: yet the polluted soule is
more sordid, then either a leprous body, or a
muddy earth. In the eye of GOD, there is
no beautie so acceptable, no foulenesse so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable,
as the soules. The Doue carried the
prayse of beautie from the Peacocke, by the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles
iudgement: that though the Peacocke li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
had the fayrer plumes, yet dead he hath but
a blacke liuer. Gods iudgement of all mens
fairenesse, is by the liuer, the <hi>cleanesse of the heart
in his eye-sight.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4 For obscuritie and darkenesse; the earth is
called a <hi>place of blacke darkenesse, the land of forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse.</hi>
So <hi>Iob</hi> and <hi>Dauid</hi> tearme it. The wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Soule is full of darkenesse, thicknesse of sight,
caecitie of vnderstanding; not <hi>seeing the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
libertie of the Sonnes of God. Our Gospell is hid
to those that are lost.</hi>

come to heare of a better &amp; richer countrey: and
then take onely with them the Lanterne of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to find it. But so <hi>erepto lumine can delabrum
querunt.</hi> Hauing lost the light, they grope for
the Candlesticke. A man that comes into his
house at midnight, sees nothing amisse: in the
day-light he finds many things misplac'd. Nature
is but a darke Lanterne, when by it we endeuour
to ransacke the conscience. Onely the light of
grace can demonstrate all the sluttish and incuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
misorders in our soules.</p>
                  <p>5 The maine resemblance betweene an euill
ground and worse man, consists in the ill fruites,
that they both produce: <hi>bryers</hi> and <hi>thornes;</hi> and
such (not onely vnhelpefull, but) hurtfull vices.
This is the principal analogie, which our Apostle
intends; the pith and marow of this reference.
But before we come to a particular anatomizing
of this Subiect, some obseruable doctrines fall
profitably to our instruction. Obserue therfore.</p>
                  <p>1 The word of God will worke some way. It

                     <hi>We preach Christ crucified,

foolishnesse. But vnto them which are called, both

                  </p>
                  <p>If this doctrine were considerately digested

                     <hi>Lord, to whom shall we

and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The word that we haue preached, shall either
saue you, or iudge you. It shall be either a copy
of your pardon, or a bill of your inditement at
the last day. <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> cals the Gospell a <hi>Fan,</hi>

It fires the one, and fines the other. Some hearts

                     <hi>Wherefore</hi> then, or from what cause <hi>brings it forth
wild grapes?</hi> The earth desires the influence of
heauen, and showres from the cloudes, to make
it fruitfull. It is granted: the Sunne shines, the
dewes fall. The Garden hereupon brings forth
<hi>herbes,</hi> the desart <hi>thornes.</hi> If these blessings of
heauen were the proper cause of the weeds; why
hath not then the good ground such cursed ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects?
The euerlasting lampe of heauen sends
forth his sauing rayes: and the sacred deawes of
the Gospell fall on the pure and vncleane heart.
There it is requited with a fertile obedience:
here with an impious ingratitude. Let not the

if it bee not a degree beyond it, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulnesse
too poore a word to expresse it.
Meere ingratitude returnes nothing for good;
but this sinne returnes euill for good. Silence in
acknowledging is too short: we must thinke of a
contumacious and contumelious retribution.
God, after his mercifull <hi>raine</hi> lookes for some

Here is <hi>Ingratitude</hi> in ful proportion, wiith all the
dimensions of his vgly stigmaiticke forme. This
is that wickednes, which brings the ground here
to reiection, malediction, combustion. Obserue
further that</p>
                  <p>4. Wicked men proue commonly so much the
worse, as they might haue been better: and diuert
the means of their conuersion to their confusion.
The more <hi>raine</hi> of the Gospell they receiue, the
more abundantly they thrust forth the <hi>thornes</hi> of
iniquities. The rootes of these bryars are surely
earthed in their hearts, and do boyle out at the
warme deaws of the Word. It fares with them, as
with a man of a surfeted stomach: the more good
meate he eates, the more hee increaseth his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.
The former crudities vndigested, vne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested,

nutriment into themselues. There is such an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathie
betwixt the good word of God, and the
heart of a reprobate; that the more it wrastles to
bring him to heauen, the more he wrastles against
it, that hee might be damned. <hi>Tully</hi> mentions a
Countrey, wherein a great drought and heat ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
abundance of mire and dirt; but store of
raine causeth dust. It is here experimentally true:
the plentifull raine of Gods blessed word is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
with the dusty and sandy barrennesse of
mens euill liues. So the Sunne, shining vpon vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane
dung-hils, is said to cause a greater stench:
yet no wise man blames the beames of the Sunne,
but the filthinesse of those putrified heapes, for
such offence. The Sunne of righteousnesse hath

Sometimes the Sunnes heat working vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

The <hi>Cicones</hi> haue a riuer, that doth harden

It was a strange protestatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that God had against

                     <note place="margin">Esa. 1. 2.</note> I haue brought them
vp in my house, and taught them my precepts, and
yet (as if my instructions and fauours had made
them worse) they haue rebelled against me. Thus
when the Sunne is hottest, the springs are coldest:
and the more feruent the loue of God is to vs, the
more cold is our charity to him, and to others for
him. As if the sweet dews of <hi>Hermon</hi> had made
the hill of <hi>Syon</hi> more barren.</p>
                  <p>It is written of the <hi>Thraeian</hi> flint, that it burnes

of those wicked soules, that are the worse
for Gods endeuour to better them. But such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
effects hath the Gospell in contrary natures.
As by the heat of the Sunne waxe is softned, and
yet clay is hardned: so by the preaching of the
word, the hearts of such as shal be saued, are mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified;

God in his wis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

since they will not bee the better for his fauours,
they shal be the worse. Seeing they wil not bring

that might not in their saluation, will be glorified
in their subuersion. For application.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Raine</hi> hath falne vpon vs all: how haue
wee entertained it? where bee our <hi>herbes?</hi> It is
obiected against vs, that our forefathers who wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

more then they knew; that we in the light of the
Gospel know more then we do. <hi>Apollonius</hi> among
other wonders writes one most wonderfull: that
there was a people, which could see nothing in
the day, but all in the night. What, hath the
Sunne blinded vs? Cannot wee see to serue God
so well in the light, as they did in the darke?</p>
                  <p>It was once said, <hi>Ignoti nulla cupido:</hi> but now it
may be inuerted; <hi>Noti nullus amor:</hi> we little e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme

Full children are weary of their bread, and
play with it. Like the Indians, that haue such
store of gold and precious stones, that they truck
them away for glasses and rattles. Perhaps the
cold legs of custome will bring vs to Church:
and we are content to heare the Preacher taxing
our frauds, vsuries, oathes, oppressions. May be
for some shew of deuotion, wee will aske counsell
at his lips: but say what he will, wee will not part
with our sinnes.</p>
                  <p>The Princes of <hi>Israel</hi> came to <hi>Ieremie,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
him to inquire of the Lord fot them:<note place="margin">Ier. 42.</note> promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
that whatsoeuer direction the Lord should
send they would obey. The <hi>Prophet</hi> accordingly
presents their supplication to God. God answers
<hi>You shall not goe into Egypt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ier. 43.</note> 
                     <hi>lest you be destroyed: but
abide still in</hi> Iudah, <hi>and you shall be safe.</hi> When
they heard this Oracle, because it was not their
humours, they replied, <hi>We will goe into Egypt.</hi> This
was their purpose from the beginning, (though
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:487:63"/>
they dissembled a will to know Gods mind) which
if Gods command crosseth, they will crosse his
command: <hi>they will goe into Egypt.</hi> So people
will be content to heare what God sayth to them
by his Ministers: but if hee speake not what plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
them, they will follow their owne affections.
Wee are such nice and froward pieces, that the
more God wooes vs, we are the further off. As
it is with some shallow professors of Musicke,
sayth the Poet.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Omnibus hoc vitium cantoribus,<note place="margin">Hor. lib. 1.</note> inter amicos,</l>

                  <p>When they are most earnestly intreated, they
make most daintie to sing or play. So the more
the Lord cals for our praises, the more hoarse are
our voices, the more harsh our notes; or perhaps
we will not sing at all. But if God hath giuen vs
musicke, and we will not dance; as Christ repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
the Iewes; wee shall mourne in sadnesse for
our obstinate refusall of profered mirth. You
haue heard <hi>Herodotus</hi> tale of the Piper. He came
to the water-side, and piped to the fishes: they
would not dance. Hee tooke his net and caught
some of them; and being throwne vpon drie land
they began to leape and skip vp. Nay, quoth the
Piper, I offered you musicke before, and you
would none: now you shal dance without a pipe.
Men commonly regard the Songs of <hi>Sion,</hi> as they
doe musicke heard late at night in the streets,
whiles they are in bed. Perhaps they will step to
the windore, and listen to it a while; and present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:487:64"/>
to bed againe. So men step from the couch
of their lusts and sinnes to, Church, heare the
Sermon; and then to bed againe; lulling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
in their former securitie.</p>
                  <p>There are some, that care for hearing it no
more: but sit downe with a conceit of their owne
sufficiencie. They know as much as all the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
can tell them: let the youth go to be Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chized.
So the sluggish and irreligious Master
sits at home, whiles hee sends his seruants to
Church. There is an old tale, idle in it selfe; the
vse may be good. A certaine man that would
neuer go to Church, when hee heard the Saints<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell,
would say to his wife. Goe thou to Church
and pray for thee and me. One night he dream't,
that both he and his wife were dead, and that they
knocked together at Heauen-gate for entrance. S.
<hi>Peter</hi> (by the Legend) is Porter, and suffred the
wife to enter in, but kept the husband out: answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
him, <hi>Illa intrauit pro se ette:</hi> She is gone in
both for her selfe and thee. As thy wife went to
Church for thee, so shee must goe to heauen for
thee. The Morall instructs euery one to haue a
personality of Faith, and a proprietie of deuotion:
that himselfe seruing GOD, himselfe may bee
blessed of God.</p>
                  <p>It now remaines, to examine more narrowly
the nature of the sinnes these vngodly hearts pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce.<note place="margin">Lib. 21. cap. 16.</note>

That which is sowne nigh or among <hi>thorns</hi>
seldome prospers. Our Sauiour saith, that the

                     <hi>for the Thornes choked it.</hi> The very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany

wicked, hath no neede of security, but to haue
cleere and circumspect eyes; lest either the <hi>thorns</hi>

boring and bloudying her sides. Either pricking

generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of men like these <hi>bryars,</hi> giuen to drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse,
whose affections are fed only with the
moisture of the pot. They cannot liue but in fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
and moorish places. <hi>Pliny</hi> saith, that addars &amp;

drunken places to the fens; where are bred
snakes and serpents, and such vile noxious things,
which euery yeare must be burned. It were a good
turne, if these morish <hi>brambles</hi> were stocked vp by
the roots. If you ask how you should rid them; I
will not point you to the Fen-men, who to make
quick dispatch of their anoiances, set fire on their
fens: but I wil giue you another precedent. When
a king asked how he might be rid of certain noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
fowles, which came abundantly flying into
his land; one answered him. <hi>Nidos eorum vbi<expan>

that the only means was to destroy their
nests in euery place. So if you would be shut of
these morish <hi>bryers,</hi> the course is to destroy their
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:487:67"/>
nests; their haunts, and <hi>rendeuous,</hi> as they terme
them; the common quagmires of all filthinesse.
The ale houses are their nests &amp; cages, where they
exhaust and lauish out their goods, and lay plots
and deuises how to get more. Hence they fal ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to robbing, or cheating; open courses of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
or secret mischiefs: till at last the Iayle pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the gibbet. For lightly they sing tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
a red lattice, before they cry through an iro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
grate. And when those <hi>bryars</hi> are hamperd, &amp; put
into prisons; it is said, that those places teach them
more villanie then they knew before. That when
a lewd fellow comes out of prison, he is furnished
with such a pack of mischiefs, that he now sets vp
schoole, and teacheth others. It is wonderfull,
that places ordained for reformation, should bee
instructions of worse lewdnes. I speak not against
mercy: but experience &amp; truth witnesseth that the
mercy of some times is crueltie. And the pittie to
a notorious malefactor argues vs of a hard heart,
&amp; of vnmercifulnes to the common-wealth. The
sparing of rapes, robberies, whoredomes, chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
frauds, vniust measures, false balances, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioneth,
yea encourageth the like. If thou be a
Magistrate, deputed to iudge it, and sparest a man
that hath shed bloud; the next bloud he sheddes
thou art guilty of. Thou consentest to the second
robbery of a thief, that hast remitted him the first.

Beare one iniurie and prouoke more: but here in

a fact of horrid nature as I formerly taxed, and

Field-bryers;</hi> which are (sayth he) shrewd ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies

Iland of ours, within these late dayes, hath bred a
great number of these <hi>field-bryars:</hi> which vnnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
turne their mother into barrennesse. Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressors,
Inclosers, Depopulators, Deportators,
Deprauators; that runne the land to ruine for a

from a publicke and generall losse.</p>
                  <p>Gaine said I? Where is it? Did you euer know
Inclosers prosper? I will speake boldly. I neuer
knew great man grow greater by his depopulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
and I hope no man will say, he hath growne
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:487:68"/>
better by them. Corne-fields are turned to sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walkes;
once-inhabited townes feede Oxen;
and Churches are made Shepheards Cottages:
and yet the doers of all this neuer the richer.
They keepe lesse Hospitality; for a few roomes
in <hi>London</hi> serue their turnes: they extort sorer
rents, and yet they haue neuer the more money.
It cannot bee denyed, but the maine end of these
courses was profite, and euhansing their estates:
and loe, in this very end GOD crosseth-them.
Speake what you will of their pride, of turning
the alms they should giue to the poore into feasts
for the rich, of their infrugall courses: I say con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently,
<hi>hic digitus Dei:</hi> here is the very hand of
God striking them. Man, though hee hath au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
will not looke to these <hi>Field-bryars;</hi> but

1. What say you to the Vsurer? Is hee not a
<hi>Thorne</hi> amongst you? If you were not Vsurers
your selues, you would confesse it. But they say, the
most horrible vsurie in the world is here practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
to 40. in the hundred: nay, to doubling of the
principall in one yeare. A landed Gentleman
wants money, he shall haue it; but in commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities:
which some compacted Broker buyes of
him, for halfe the rate they cost him, in ready
money. Are these Christians? dare they shew
their faces in the Temple? But I know, you haue
been often told of these things. In a word, euen

pricks the side of the Countrey till the bloud fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes.
An Vsurer with his money, is like a man
that hath no worke of his owne, yet keepes a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant
to let out: and takes not onely hire of others
for his dayes labour; but chargeth him to steale
somewhat besides, and neuer to returne home
emptie. You vnderstand me: I neede not further
apply it.</p>
                  <p>These are vile winding and wounding <hi>bryers,</hi>
that fetch away clothes, and skinne, and flesh
too. Now the mercie of God ridde vs of these
<hi>thornes.</hi> And let vs know it is for our sinnes, that
God suffers Vsurers among vs. It may be he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
them, as he did the Cananites for a while in
<hi>Israel,</hi> lest the wilde beasts should break in vpon
them. Lest pride, and haughtinesse, and vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
should spill mens soules by a full estate of
wealth. God suffers Vsurers like Horse-leeches
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:487:69"/>
to suck and soke them: thereby (possibly) to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
them. Yet in meane time, I may say of them,
as <hi>Iosuah</hi> did of those Cananites;<note place="margin">Iosh. 23. 13.</note> that <hi>they are

                  <p>2 What doe you thinke of <hi>Adulterie?</hi> Is it
not a <hi>Thorne,</hi> yes, a sharpe <hi>thorne,</hi> wounding the
purse, enuenoming the body, condemning the
Soule. The ground that beares it is lust: the sappe
that feeds it, is fulnesse of bread and Idlenesse: the
heate that makes it glow, grow, and shoote, is
lewd and wanton speech, and effeminate gestures:
infamie is the budde; pollution the fruite; and
the end Hell-fire. And as <hi>Caietan</hi> and <hi>Theophilact</hi>
obserues on 1. <hi>Thes.</hi> 4.<note place="margin">Thess. 4. 4.</note> that the Apostle hauing
bid men <hi>possesse their vessell in holinesse,</hi> he addes;
<hi>And let no man goe beyond or defraud his brother in
any matter:</hi> that this circumuention may be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Adulterie, when a man is deceiued of his
bosome-spouse; who is hired to the subornation
of bastards. So that lightly, concupiscence and
cousenage goe together. As that wickednesse, of
all others, neuer goes but by couples. For Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers

                  <p>3 Corrupt and consciensce-les Lawyers you will
confesse to bee sharpe and wounding brambles,
and exceedingly hurtfull. A poore Client among
them, is as a blind sheepe in a thicket of <hi>thornes:</hi>
there is no hope of his fleece, it is well if he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
away his flesh whole on his backe. A motion
this terme, an order next; instantly al cross'd: scarce
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:487:70"/>
the twentith order sometimes stands: execution is
suspended, a writ of errour puts all out of course.
Oh the vncertaine euents of suits! I hope, sayes
the poore bloud-drawne wretch, I shall haue an
end of my suite next terme; nay, nor the next
terme, nor the next yeare. Foole! thou art gotten
into a suite of durance; almost an immortall suit.
And when the vpshot comes, perhaps the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleading
of a word shall forfet all. It is a lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
vncertaintie, and one politicke addition of
ficklenesse to the goods of this world, that no man
might set his heart vpon them: that an estate
bought, truly payd for, and inherited, shall bee
gone vpon a word; sometimes vpon a sillable; v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
a very bare letter, omitted or mis-written by
the Scriuener. These are scratching <hi>bryers.</hi> If
what is wanting in the goodnes of the cause, be
supplyed by the greatnes of the fees, their tongs
shall excuse their tongs for their contra-consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
pleadings. The Italians haue a shrewd pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe

This prouerbe I leaue with them; and come to

at their backes, and they all to rent the countrey,
with briberie and extortion. These men seeke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
authority, and commanding-places, not with
any intent of good to the common-wealth, but to
fill their owne purses, to satisfie their owne lusts.

As some loue to bee poring in the fire, not that

<hi>Gibeonites</hi> they are; and howsoeuer they pretend
their <hi>old shooes,</hi> the antiquitie of their Church, we
haue euer found them <hi>thornes;</hi> ready to put out
our eyes, and (if they could) the eye of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.
They exclaime against vs for persecution;
and cry themselues (lowder then oyster-women
in the streets) for patient Catholicks, Saints, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs.
But match the peace they enioy vnder vs,
with the tyrannie they exercised ouer vs; the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
our Fathers at stakes, the butchering our
Princes, their conspiracie against our whole
Realme, their continuall bending their weapons
against Soueraignes and subiects throtes; and
you will say, they are <hi>thornes.</hi> I haue read of a bird,
that when men are deuout at their sacrifice, takes
fire from the Altar, and burnes their houses. All
their blacke treasons, and bloudy intendments,
they deriue from the Altar; and pleade the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of Religion, to set our whole Land in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustion.
O that these <hi>brambles</hi> were stock'd vp:
that <hi>Ishmael</hi> were cast out of dores, that <hi>Sara</hi> and
her sonne <hi>Isaac</hi> might liue in quiet.</p>
                  <p>6 There are furious male contents among vs:
a contemptible generation of <hi>thorns;</hi> that (because
their hands are pinion'd) pricke onely with their
tongs. They are euer whining, and vpon the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:487:71"/>
least cause filling the world with importunate
complaints. These are sauage &amp; popular humors,
that cannot suffer eminency to passe vnreproched.
But they must vellicate goodnes, and gird great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
that neither the liuing can walke, nor the
dead sleepe, in quiet. Affecters of innouation,
that are euer finding fault with the present times:
any thing pleaseth them but what is. Euen the
best blessings of God scape not their ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sures: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do they esteem by iudgement, or pronounce
by reason: they find fault with things, they know
not wherefore, but because they do not like them.
Beware these <hi>thornes:</hi> they are like the wheeles of
some cunningly wrought fire-workes; that flie
out on all sides; and offering to singe others,
burne themselues. <hi>Laudant veteres, &amp;c.</hi> as if no
times were so miserable as ours. As if the ciuill
wars of France, or the bloudy Inquisitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Spain,
or the Turkish crueltie in <hi>Natolia,</hi> where hee
breeds his souldiers; or at home, the time of the
Barons war; or yet later, the persecution of a <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;</hi>
were none of them so cruell, as these dayes,
when euery man sits and sings vnder his owne
figge-tree. Sure if they had once tasted the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesse
of war, they would better esteem of their
peace. These are pestilent <hi>thornes:</hi> nothing but
feare keeps them from conspiracie. Nay, so they
might set the whole land on fire, they would not
grudge their owne ashes.</p>
                  <p>7. There are <hi>bryers</hi> too growing neere the
Church; too neare it. They haue raised Church-liuings
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:487:71"/>
to foure and fiue yeares purchase: and it
is to be feared, they will shortly racke vp presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatiue
liuings, to as high a rate, as they did their
impropriations, when they would sell them. For
they say, few will giue aboue sixteene yeares pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
for an impropriate Parsonage; and I haue
heard some rate the donation of a benefice they
must giue, at ten yeares: what with the present
money they must haue, and with referuation of
tythes, and such vnconscionable trickes; as if
there was no God in heauen, to see or punish it.
Perhaps, some wil not take so much: but most will
take some; enough to impouerish the Church, to
enrich their owne purses, to damne their soules.</p>
                  <p>One would thinke, it was sacriledge enough
to robbe God of his maine tythes: must they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
nimme away the shreddes? must they needes
shrinke the whole cloth, (enough to apparell the
Church) as the cheating Taylor did, to a dozen
of buttons? Hauing full gorged themselues with
the parsonages, must they picke the bones of the
Vicaredges too? Well sayth S. <hi>August. Multi in
hac vita manducant, quod postea apud inferos dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt.</hi>
Many deuoure that in this life, which they
shall digest in hell.</p>
                  <p>These are the <hi>Church-briers;</hi> which (let alone)
wil at last bring as famous a Church, as any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome
hath, to beggerie. Politicke men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
a pace alreadie to with-hold their children
from Schooles and Vniuersities. Any profession
els better likes them; as knowing, they may liue
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:487:72"/>
well in whatsoeuer calling, saue in the ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
The time was, that Christ threw the <hi>buyers</hi>
and <hi>sellers</hi> out of the <hi>Temple;</hi> but now the <hi>buyers</hi>
and <hi>sellers</hi> haue throwne him out of the Temple.
Yea, they wil throw the church out of the church
if they bee not stayed. But some may say to me,
as one aduised <hi>Luther,</hi> when he began to preach
against the Popes vsurpation and tyrannie, <hi>You
had as good hold your peace. This wickednesse is so
powerfull, that you will neuer preuaile against it. Get
you to your study, and say, Lord haue mercy on vs, and
procure your selfe no ill will.</hi> But be it good will, or
be it ill will, we come hither to speake the truth in
our consciences. And if these <hi>Church-thornes</hi> will
continue their wickednesse, bee it vnto them as
they haue deserued. If they will needs go to hell,
let them go: we cannot helpe it, let them perish.
I had purposed the discouery of more <hi>Brambles,</hi>
but the time forbids it. I would to God, we
were well freed from those I
haue taxed.</p>

doe often wicked conceits runne into? In their

sinne to be sinne. At last desperately, they thinke
it such a sinne, that it cannot be forgiuen. At first
they are delighted with the sense and smel of their
iniquitie, as of a sweet rose: but the rose of their
delight withers, and there is a <hi>thorne</hi> vnder it, that
pricks the hart. Hereupon <hi>Salomon</hi> couples pleasa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t

you shall heare him in the madnes of despaire, cry

they make question whether it be a sinne: at last
they know it such a sinne, that they make question
whether God will forgiue it. So men will looke to
sin either too superficially, or too superstitiously.
There was no danger saith the Drunkard, when

                  <p>I need not further amplifie this point. Christ
giues a <hi>vae ridentibus; Woe to them that laugh, for

turned to a grone of sorrow. They that exhibite
their liues as sacrifices <hi>risuiet lubentiae;</hi> shall one

and peircing their hearts: when (like the
strucken deare, with the arrowhead rankling in his
side) they shall not bee able to shift or change
paines with places. Let this reach to our soules
two instructions.</p>
                  <p>1 That we labour our hearts betimes to a sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siblenesse
of these <hi>thornes.</hi> A <hi>Thorne</hi> swallowed
into the flesh, if it be not look'd to, rankles. Sinne
without repentance, will fester in the soule; and is
so much more perilous, as it is lesse felt. Oh the
number of <hi>thornes</hi> that lie in many conscience,
who complaine no more, then if they ayld no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:487:76"/>
The pricke of a <hi>thorne</hi> is not so painefull
at first, while the bloud is hote, as after a cold
pause. Euerie man hath his complaints; &amp; who
liueth out of the reach of discontent? You shall
heare tradesmen complaining of few or false
customers. Labourers, of little worke, and lesse
wages. Beggars complaine the want of Charity:
and rich men the want of money. Merchants of
rockes and Pyrats: Lawyers of short fees; and
Clyents of long suits. But no man complaines
of the <hi>thornes</hi> in his owne bosome. He nourisheth
<hi>bryers</hi> there that wound him: and the heart is as
dedolent,<note place="margin">Ephe. 4. 19.</note> as if it were <hi>past feeling.</hi> But where there
is no discouerie of the disease, the recouery of the
health is in vaine hoped for.</p>
                  <p>2 After sense of the smart will follow a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of remedy. The throbbing conscience would
be at ease, and freed from the <hi>Thorne</hi> that vexeth
it. <hi>Dauid rores out for the very disquietnesse of his
heart.</hi> The aking heart will make a crying tong,
and wet eyes. Loe the mercie of GOD! A
remedy is not sooner desired, then offred. The
sacred Gospell directs vs to a medicine, that shall
supple the heart, and draw out these <hi>thornes;</hi>
though they stucke as thicke in it, as euer the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes
did in <hi>Sebastian.</hi> They speake of the herbe
<hi>Dictamnum,</hi> call'd of some Ditanie, that it hath a
secret vertue to draw out any thing fastened in the
body.<note place="margin">Lib. 26. cap. 14.</note>

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:487:76"/>
to exhale a <hi>thorne</hi> out of the flesh. Our onely
<hi>Dictamnum</hi> is the precious bloud of our merciful
Sauiour IESVS CHRIST. A plaister of that is
truely vertuall, to draw out all <hi>thornes</hi> from our
consciences, <hi>Saucia <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nimis,</hi> which is <hi>nulla medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilis
herbis,</hi> is thus cured. Our sinnes drew bloud
of him; that his bloud might saue vs. He was
<hi>crowned with Thornes,</hi> that we might not be kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with <hi>thornes.</hi> He was wounded for vs, that
we might not perish for our selues.</p>
                  <p>Take we heed, that we despise not this medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine.
The law was so farre from drawing out
these <hi>thornes,</hi> that it would driue them in further,
and cause them to rankle in the heart, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
hope of ease. It did but exasperate their
stings, and giue them a deeper continuance of
pricking. The mollifying and healing Gospell
extracts their venome, and sucks out their poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
Let vs not dare then to vilipend this cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
and soueraigne medicine.</p>
                  <p>You perceiue that our sinnes are <hi>Thornes;</hi> and
what is their onely remedy. Know now, that if
they be not drawne out in this world, they shall
be found <hi>thornes</hi> hereafter; when the owners
shall heare <hi>Christs</hi> sentence, <hi>Goe yee cursed, &amp;c.</hi>
for <hi>the end of them is to be burned.</hi> So I come to
the <hi>punishment:</hi> but I will soone haue done with
that, which shall neuer haue done with those
that must vndergoe it.</p>
                  <p>There is a threefold gradation in the Penalty,
<hi>Reiection, malediction, combustion. Is reiected, is
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:487:77"/>
nigh vnto cursing, and the end thereof is to be bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi>
And it seems to haue relation to a threefold
distinction of time. 1. For the present, <hi>it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected.</hi>
2. For instance or appropinquation, <hi>it is
nigh vnto cursing.</hi> 3. For future certainty, <hi>the
end of it is to be burned.</hi> As men commonly
deale with <hi>thornes:</hi> first they cut them vp with
bils and mattocks: then they lay them by to wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
and lastly burne them in the furnace.</p>
                  <p>1 <hi>Reiection.</hi> This which we here translate (is
<hi>reiected)</hi> is in the originall (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) which
may signifie <hi>Reprobios,</hi> or <hi>reprobatus:</hi> so <hi>Beza</hi>
hath it; is <hi>reproued,</hi> or disallowed of God. This
ground shall haue no ground in heauen, no part
in God inheritance. It is reprobate siluer, not
current with the Lord. No man desires to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
Land, that will bring forth nothing but
weedes: he will not cast away his siluer vpon it.
And shall GOD buy so base ground, that will
be no better, at so inestimable a price, as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible
bloud of his owne Sonne? It des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piseth
the Lords goodnesse, and the LORDS
goodnesse shall despise it. <hi>It is reiected.</hi> If any
man sayth, this is <hi>Durus Sermo,</hi> let him consider
of whom the Apostle speaketh, <hi>verse.</hi> 4. against
whom hee concludes <hi>ab impossibili. It is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
&amp;c.</hi>
A hard saying to vnderstand, but more,
most heard to vndergoe. If God be driuen to
loose all his paines and cost vpon an ingratefull
heart, he will at last renounce it, and giue it ouer
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:487:77"/>
a desperate nature. As he in the Comedy, <hi>Abeat,
pereat, profundat, perdat. If it will be filthy, let it
be filthy still.</hi> If nothing will bring it to good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
it shall <hi>be reiected.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. The second degree of the <hi>Punishment</hi> is
<hi>cursing:</hi> and this may seeme to exceed the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
Gods <hi>curse</hi> is a fearefull thing. If you
would view (though but in part) the latitude
and extension of it, I refer you to the 28. of <hi>Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teronomy.</hi>
But I purpose not to bee curiously
punctuall, in the demonstration of these particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
degrees of the <hi>Punishment.</hi> That which I wil
obserue, is this.</p>
                  <p>That God is more propense and inclined to
<hi>blessing,</hi> then to <hi>cursing:</hi> more prone to shewe
mercy, then to inflict iudgement. It is sayd in
the former Verse, the <hi>good ground receiues blessing
of God:</hi> receiues it presently, receiues it at once.
But here of the euill ground; <hi>it is nigh vnto cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing:</hi>
it is not presently <hi>cursed,</hi> but <hi>nigh vnto it.</hi>
There is some pawse and delay: some <hi>lucida
interualla misericordiae.</hi> The whole viall of wrath
is not poured on at once. But first there is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spising
or <hi>reiection;</hi> to let the wicked see, how
hatefull their vices are in Gods sight. If this
serue not, they are not sodainely <hi>cursed;</hi> but
there is a breathing time, and a mercifull space
betweene that and <hi>cursing;</hi> and betweene <hi>cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi>
and <hi>burning.</hi> So slowly doth GOD proceed
to iudgement, so little haste he makes to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:487:78"/>
of his vengeance. Hee is speedy to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer,
to saue, to giue his <hi>blessing;</hi> but hee hath
leaden feet when he comes to strike.</p>
                  <p>The vse of this to our selues is, that the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
forbearance of God may leade vs to <hi>repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
Romans</hi> the second and the fourth.<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 4.</note> The

mercifull and <hi>slow to anger.</hi> Gods long-suffering
is as a hand reached out, that points vs to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</hi>
Such is his goodnesse, that when all

                  <p>2. The second round of this Ladder is
<hi>Preparation.</hi> Some there are that will <hi>prepare,</hi>
&amp; almost set themselues in a readinesse for their
iourney to heauen; yet neuer set one steppe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
<hi>Preparation</hi> is indeed as necessary, as the
dore is to the house: but as idle, if there be no
house to the dore. It may (as <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi>
did for Christ) <hi>prepare the way of the Lord</hi> into
our hearts: and it may be as vaite, as the <hi>Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries
Beast,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Testia Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macopolae.</note> which hee promised his Patient

                     <hi>Prepare to meet thy God, O Israel.</hi> But a man may
<hi>prepare</hi> meate, and not feede: <hi>prepare</hi> meate,
and not eate. <hi>Prepaeration</hi> does well, if <hi>reparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
followes. A man may climbe both these
rounds, and yet fall short of the true height of
<hi>Repentance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. The third stairre is a <hi>Beginning</hi> to abstaine
from some horrid iniquities; and as it were, an
entring into a new path; but not going one step
in it, without a voluntary reuolting. But <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning</hi>
is nothing to perfection. Some <hi>begin in

in the market place; take acquaintance of him
in the street, but neuer bid him home to their

speech of them that passe by. <hi>This man began
to build.</hi> A house but begun is not fit to dwell in:
and shall wee thinke that Gods Spirit will dwell
in an inchoate habitacle, and not likely to be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished?

                  <p>4 The fourth Round onely pleaseth God, and
is good for our Soules, <hi>Repentance;</hi> without

                  <p>3 The last and forest degree of the <hi>Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
is <hi>Burning.</hi> I will not discourse, whether
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:487:80"/>
the fire of that euerlastingly-hote furnace be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall
or spirituall. Surely, it is strangely terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
and wee are blessed, if wee neither vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
it nor vndergoe it. The miserie of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
is vsually distinguished into the <hi>Paine of losse,</hi>

and from the glory of his power,</hi> there is <hi>paine</hi> of

                  </p>
                  <p>1. This <hi>Poena damni,</hi> or priuation of bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednesse,
may seeme to be implyed in the first
degree here mentioned, <hi>Reiection.</hi> The repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
are cast away of God. Much like that forme

                     <hi>Depart from

<hi>From Me,</hi> sayth Christ; that made my

for your redemption, &amp; receiued these &amp; these
wounds for your remedie. <hi>From Me,</hi> that would

you. <hi>From Me,</hi> that inuited you to mercy,

is a fearefull <hi>Reiection,</hi> My friendship, my fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:487:81"/>
my Paradise, my presence, my heauen,
<hi>where is fulnesse of ioy, and pleasure for euermore,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 16. vlt.</note> are
none of yours. They might haue been; they are
lost. Neither shall they onely loose Christ, but
all the companie with Christ: the Quire of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Angels, the society of his <hi>blessed</hi> Mother,
the Prophets, Apostles, Martyrs, all the happy
and holy Saints, with the whole host of heauen.
They shall fret, and vexe, and bee ready to eate
their owne galls, to see those triumphing in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
whom they on earth persecuted, martyred,
tortured. They could here exercise their sauage
tyranny ouer them; not onely denying their
owne bread, but taking away theirs: they could
despise, beate, maligne, vndoe, burne them at
stakes: now the estate of both is changed: as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
told <hi>Diues. They are comforted,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 16. 25.</note> 
                     <hi>and thou
art tormented.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. This is not all. The <hi>priuation</hi> of blessed
ioyes is not enough: there must follow the <hi>posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of cursed torments. For their <hi>Punishment</hi> is
proportioned to their sinne, <hi>Ier.</hi> 2.<note place="margin">Ier. 2. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>They haue
committed two euils. They haue forsaken the Lord,
the fountaine of liuing waters, and hewed them out
cisternes, broken cisternes that can hold no water.</hi>
As they turned from their Maker, so their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
turnes from them: there is <hi>Poenadamni.</hi> As
they fastned their delights on the creatures, so
the creatures shall be their tortures: there is <hi>Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na
sensus.</hi> They reiected God, and hee <hi>reiects</hi>
                     <pb n="155" facs="tcp:487:81"/>
them; they adhered to wickednesse, and it shall
adhere to their bones for euer, and bring them
to <hi>burning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Their torments which are here expressed by
<hi>Fire,</hi> haue two fearefull conditions, vniuersali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and eternitie.</p>
                  <p>1. They are vniuersall, vexing euery part of
the body, and power of the soule. It is terrible
in this life, to be pained in euery part of the body
at one time. To haue ache in the teeth, gowt in
the feete, collick in the reines, &amp;c. and to lye (as
it were) vpon a racke, for innumerable diseases,
like so many executioners, to torture him, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable.
But the largest shadowe of these tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to their substance, is not so much as a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
bone-fire to the combustion of the whole
world.</p>
                  <p>2. They are eternall. If it had but as many
ages to <hi>burne,</hi> as there be trees standing on the
earth, there would bee some, though a tedious
hope of their end. But it is such a <hi>Fire,</hi> as shall
neuer be quenched. This word <hi>Neuer</hi> is feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
Though they raine floudes of teares vpon
it, they shall bee but like oyle to encrease the
flame: for the <hi>worme neuer dyes, the fire neuer
goes out.</hi> You see the <hi>end</hi> of <hi>Thornes. Wickednes
burneth as the fire:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Esa. 9. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>it shall deuoure the bryers and
thornes, and shall kindle in the thickest of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
and they shall mount vp like the lifting vp of

                        </gap>.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="156" facs="tcp:487:82"/>
I resolued against prolixity. The generall
and summary doctrine is this. That since the
wicked ground, which <hi>beareth thornes and bry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
is neere vnto cursing, and the end thereof</hi> is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
fire: it followes necessarily, that all they
which lay the foundation of vngodlinesse, must
needs build vpon condemnation. <hi>Let no man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
you:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">I. Ioh. 3. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>He that committeth sinne is of the Diuell.</hi>
If the course of a mans life be wicked, couetous,
vncleane, malicious, idolatrous, adulterous, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken;
hee layes the ground-worke of his owne
destruction; and precipitates himselfe to the
malediction of God. Hee that layes the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
in fire-work, must looke to be blowne vp.
Perhaps this meditation, though it bee of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable
<hi>Fire,</hi> may yet worke coldly in our
hearts; and leaue no impression behinde it; yet
you cannot deny this to be true. He that would
denie it must deny my Text, must turne Atheist,
and reiect the holy word of God. Nay, he must
thinke there is no God, no reuenge of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
no diuell, no hell. And he vndertakes a
very hard taske, that goes about to settle this
perswasion in his mind. No, no. <hi>Let no man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
you with vaine words:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 5. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>for because of these
things cometh the wrath of God vpon the children
of disobedience.</hi> And in this passage I must value
all men alike: of what stuffe, or of what fashion
soeuer his coate be: if his life be full of <hi>bryers</hi>
and <hi>thornes,</hi> his <hi>end</hi> is to be <hi>burned. What shall
we</hi> then <hi>doe vnto thee, O thou preseruer of men,</hi> that
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:487:82"/>
wee may escape it? what,<note place="margin">Mark. 1. 15.</note> but <hi>Repent, and beleeue
the Gospell!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let the commination of hell instruct vs to
preuent it: as the message of <hi>Niniuehs</hi> ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
effected their safetie. 1. Let vs flie by a
true faith into the armes of our Redeemer, that
God <hi>reiect</hi> vs not. 2. Let vs poure forth flouds
of repentant teares, that wee bee not <hi>nigh vnto
cursing.</hi> 3. And let vs <hi>bring forth</hi> no more <hi>bry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars</hi>
and <hi>thornes,</hi> that our <hi>end</hi> may not be, to bee
<hi>burned.</hi> Faith, Repentance, Obedience; this
same golden rule of three, will teach vs to worke
vp our owne <hi>saluation.</hi> This done, wee shall not
be <hi>reiected,</hi> but knowne to bee elected: we shall
be so farre from <hi>cursing.</hi> that we shal presently <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
the blessing.</hi> And our <hi>End</hi> shall be, not fire,
but glorie and peace.<note place="margin">Psal. 37. 37.</note>
