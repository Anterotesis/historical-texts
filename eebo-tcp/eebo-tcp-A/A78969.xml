            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas We have not received that ſatisfaction We expected (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding Our many Proclamations and Orders made for the Government of Our Army, and particularly againſt the loſing, ſeiling away, and ſpoyling of Our Arms by the Common-Souldiers, and for the keeping them fixt) But on the contrary, finding thoſe abuſes and neglects ſtill to continue &amp; encreaſe; We are therefore once more enforced, &amp; do hereby ſtraitly Require and Command all Colonells, Lieutenant-Colonells, Serjeant-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jors, Captians, and other Officers of Our Army, whom it may concern, forthwith, or within four dayes after the publication hereof, to return to Us, Our Councell of Warre, or to the Serje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant-Major-Generall of Our Army, a true accompt of the number and quantity of Arms in each Company and Regiment of Our Army, atteſted by the Colonell, Lieutenant-Colonell, Serjeant-Major, or Captain of each Company; and if any Arms ſhall henceforward be found unfixt by the negligence of the Souldier, the Reparation thereof ſhall be made good out of his or their Entertainments; and this courſe We will conſtantly to be continued and put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, the care and overſight whereof to be committed to the reſpective Quartermaſter of each Regiment (or ſome other fit perſon appointed by the Colonell) whom We command, once in fourteen dayes, to take a view of all the Arms of the Regiment, and to ſee Our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands therein fully obeyed: And for the more ſpeedy execution thereof, Our will is, That each Colonell make choice of two able Gun-ſmiths to be imployed therein, on whom We in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſettle an Allowance fitting for the ſame. And to the end the loſſe of Arms may not be ſo frequent (to the prejudice of Our Service) as formerly, Our further pleaſure is, That each Captain, upon the return of the Certificate of the number and quantitie of the Arms of his Company, ſtand charged to Us by Indenture (in the Office of Our Ordinace) for ſuch numbers certified; which Arms are to be made good out of His Entertainment, if hereafter they ſhall be wilfully or negligently made away by His Souldiers. Laſtly, Our Will and Command is, That all Arms bought, or provided by Us, or by any Perſon for Our Service, as likewiſe all Arms borrowed in any Counties hereafter, or taken from the Rebells, or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons diſaffected to Our Service, be firſt brought into Our Magazines, and from thence, as we ſhall direct, be diſtributed, and given out for Our Service. To Our Pleaſure herein de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, We require full and ſpeedy Obedience to be given by all Officers and Souldiers of Our Army: And that it may be the more fully put in execution, Our further Pleaſure and Command is, That this be read within four dayes after the publication, at the head of every Regiment and Company, that ſo all Our Officers and Souldiers, whom it may concern, may take notice of it, and obſerve the ſame, as they and every of them will avoid Our high Diſpleaſure for their neglect of any the leaſt particular herein mentioned.</p>
