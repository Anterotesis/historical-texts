            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHEREAS Wee the Inhabitants of the Counties afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,
have endeavoured, by the beſt, and (as it ſeemed unto
us, the moſt effectuall meanes, (a peaceable Application
of our ſelves by way of Petition) humbly and ſadly to offer
unto the preſent Parliament, the many miſeries which (by a new and bloody
engagement in the moſt unnaturall Warre) were ſuddenly threatned unto this
whole Kingdome and Nation; and propoſed unto them, as the only expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
to prevent theſe; <hi>The preſent re-eſtabliſhing of his Majeſty unto his royall
Rights. the Settlement of Religion and Liberty, according unto the known, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
Lawes, and (upon payment of their Arreares) the disbanding of the Armie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet finding, unto our unſpeakable Griefe, that a prevailing partie in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Parliament, contrary unto their many ſolemn profeſſions and proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and the ends for which wee firſt engaged with them; have by the power of
the Army impriſoned the Kings Majeſtie, overthrown Religion; and our liberty,
and now for divers years continued the free-born People of England in a greater
Servitude, then at any time ſince the Norman Conqueſt; and have ſlighted us
in all our Addreſſes unto them; in regard whereof, and for timely ſuppreſſion
of theſe uſurpations, and miſchiefes daily growing upon us, (no other way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now left us) we have reſolved to Arme, and by our power (God aſſiſting) to
Command what wee could not iutreat.</p>
            <p>Unto the end and purpoſe aforeſaid; we doe hereby heartily and ſeriouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
you, like honeſt and true-harted Engliſh-men, to joyne with us in this good
worke, and deſire you that upon notice hereof, every of you either ſerving on
horſeback, or of the foot, in the ſaid Army, forthwith to repair with your horſes
and Armes unto us, or the ſeverall places of your abodes before your engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with the Armie, where you ſhall immediately be provided for, according
unto your ſeverall qualities; and alſo preſent care ſhal be taken that your whole
Arreares, ſhal be forthwith paid unto you; And this as wee undertake for our
ſelves ſo we doubt not to effect for you, in all the counties throughout the whole
Kingdome: Aſſuring our ſelves that you will no longer adhere unto a Faction,
ſet up to deſtroy this flouriſhing Kingdome, againſt your friends, kindred, your
own Bowells, and the preſent and future good of your Countrey; which ought
to be more deare unto every of you then his own life.</p>
            <p>Whereof if yee ſhall take due notice, and doe accordingly, yee may aſſuredly
expect from us, the regards and benefit aforeſaid, otherwiſe wee ſhall eſteeme
(and ſo deale with) you, as ſworn enemies unto your King and Country.</p>
