            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F we were to judge of the <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>Christianity</hi> by the designs and practices of some, who would be thought the only <hi>true</hi> and <hi>Catholick Christians,</hi> we should have no great reason to esteem it our honour to be called by his Name, who first brought this Religion into the world. For if the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> did indeed justifie all the <hi>fraud</hi> and <hi>treachery,</hi> the <hi>mischief</hi> and <hi>cruelty</hi> which hath been either acted or designed by men under the glorious pretence of advancing the interest of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> we might better choose not to be <hi>Christians,</hi> than to be such <hi>men</hi>: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause whatever Religion overthrows the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55951:3"/>
principles and duties of humane nature, such as those of <hi>Civil obedience, integrity</hi> and <hi>humanity</hi> are, cannot be supposed a Religion proper or intended by God for mankind; whose great end in Religion is to improve and rectifie, and not to debauch or corrupt the dispositions of men. Men need no Religion to instruct them in the arts of deceiving, the contrivances of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, or the methods of revenge; such <hi>fruits</hi> as these spring up too easily in our corrupt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate natures, which need no great force or improvement to bring them forth: But when the warmth of the Sun shall be joyned with the fruitfulness of the soil, when men are encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to pursue their own natural inclinations by the most powerful motives of Religion, what bounds can be set to the growth and increase of these accursed fruits? Of all Religions in the world, we might have thought the Christian least lyable to be abused to such ill purposes; for it was one of <hi>Machiavel</hi>'s quarrels against Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, that by its precepts of meekness and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, it rendred men unfit for such great under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, which could not be accomplished with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out something of cruelty and inhumanity, whereas the old Religions by the multitude of Sacrifices did inure men to blood and destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and so made them fitter for any enterprise. And <hi>Machiavel</hi> was certainly in the right, if Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55951:3"/>
were intended only to make men <hi>Butchers</hi>: or to instruct them in the Use of Swords and Gun-powder. Nay, the Religion of <hi>Mahomet</hi> is in this respect to be very much preferred before the Christian, for that makes it not only lawful to destroy those of a different Religion, but enrolls them for Martyrs that dye in the Field, and makes the blood of enemies as meritorious, as we do that of the Cross. But that is reserved as the peculiar honour of the Christian Religion, that it commands the subduing all the bruitish and savage inclinations of men to acts of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge and cruelty; that it restores humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to it self by its precepts of meekness, mercy, peaceableness, and universal charity; that it advances it to a divine nature by the imitation of God himself, in shewing kindness to enemies, and overcoming evil with good. This is the Religion established by our Lord and Saviour in this excellent Sermon on the Mount, wherein the scope and design of Christianity is delivered with the greatest plainness and perspicuity; which (if it be possible for us to judge of his meaning by the clearest expressions) was far enough from being the setting up a Monarchy in the Church to which all the Kings of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian world are by their Baptism bound to vail their Crowns, and lay their Scepters at its feet: or in case they do not, that then this Spiritual


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55951:4"/>
Monarch may excommunicate, depose, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive Princes of their Government, and dissolve all the obligations between their Subjects and them; and make it lawful for them to depose them: We find not the least footstep of any thing tending this way, where our Saviour speaks most advantageously concerning the honour of his Disciples; which honour he represents by things which set forth their usefulness in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon: <hi>Ye are the Salt of the Earth, ye are the light of the World</hi>;<note place="margin">Matth. 5.13, 14.</note> and not by setting up one above all the rest, <hi>far above all Principalities and Powers,</hi> to whom Kings and Princes, and all People are bound to be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, if they regard their salvation. If any such thing as this had been so material a part of the Christian Doctrine, as some imagine, if it had been so necessary to salvation, it is somewhat strange, that when our Blessed Saviour gave so many directions in order to salvation he should give not so much as the least intimation concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this. And yet he saith, at the end of this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, <hi>Every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doth them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 7.24.</note> 
               <hi>is like unto a wise man that built his house upon a rock</hi>; not <hi>super hanc Petram, i e.</hi> according to the <hi>Roman Gloss,</hi> upon the Popes Authority; but upon such a firm foundation as will never fail him. And what is it which our Saviour endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to perswade men to, in order to so firm a settlement of their minds against all the assaults


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55951:4"/>
of persecutions? <hi>viz.</hi> to humility, meekness, goodness, univeral holiness, to the love of God and mankind, to sincerity in devotion, depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on Providence, prayer, and doing as we would be done by: this is the substance of the Christian Law delivered by the Son of God; than which nothing can be imagined more contrary to the Spirit of Faction and disobedience, of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty and revenge, and that covered over with a pretence of zeal for Religion. But he who gave these excellent precepts, did foresee, that there would arise <hi>men who should preach and prophesie in his Name, and in his Name cast out Devils, and do wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful works</hi>: that yet for all their fair shews and pretences to the world should be of a temper and disposition directly contrary to the Gospel; and therefore it was necessary for all Christians, as they valued their own welfare, to have an eye to them, lest they should be deceived by them: which is the meaning of our Saviour in these words; <hi>Beware of false Prophets which come to you in Sheeps clothing, but inwardly they are ravening Wolves; by their fruits ye shall know them.</hi> Wherein we have these two things considerable.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Caution given, <hi>Beware of false Prophets,</hi> together with the ground of that Caution, <hi>For they come to you in Sheeps clothing, but inwardly are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening Wolves.</hi>

               <p>1. The Caution given, <hi>Beware of false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</hi> There were two sorts of deceivers our Saviour gives his Disciples particular caution against, viz. <hi>false Christs and false Prophets</hi>; the <hi>false Christs</hi> were those who pretended that they were the persons who were foretold by the Prophets that should come for the redemption of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;<note place="margin">Mat. 24.24</note>

                  <hi>and shall deceive many.</hi> Not as though they pretended to be sent by Christ, but that they would assume to themselves the Dignity and Authority of the true Messias; and of this sort, there were many that arose among the Jews, such as <hi>Theudas, Jonathas, Barchochebas,</hi> and many others. But besides these, there were <hi>false Prophets,</hi> some of which did openly oppose Christianity, such as that <hi>Bar-Jesus</hi> mentioned in the <hi>Acts</hi>;<note place="margin">Acts 13.6.</note> but there were others who pretended to own Christianity, and to prophesie in the Name of Christ,<note place="margin">Mat. 7.21.</note> whom S. <hi>Peter</hi> calls <hi>false Teachers</hi>; and whom S. <hi>Paul</hi> describes by the same character that our Saviour here doth:<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.1.</note>

                  <hi>deceitful workers transforming themselves into the Apostles of Christ</hi>: which carryed so fair a shew and appearance among the people, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> was very full of jealousie and apprehension con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, lest they should by degrees draw away his Disciples from the simplicity of the Gospel of Christ. <hi>For I am jealous over you,</hi> saith he, <hi>with godly jealousie; but I fear lest by any means as the Serpent beguiled</hi> Eve <hi>through his subtilty,</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. That nothing is more easie, than for false Teachers to pretend to an infallible Spirit; such whom our Saviour and his Apostles did warn men especially against, pretended to be <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apostles,</hi> and to know the mind of Christ bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than they who truly had the assistance of the Holy Ghost. Some think <hi>the bare pretence to Infallibility ought in such a divided state of the Christian world to be entertained as the best


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55951:7"/>
expedient to end Controversies, and that Church which doth alone challenge it, ought on that account to be submitted to</hi>; as though the most confident pretenders were to be soonest believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: so they will be, do what we can, by the weakest sort of mankind, but by none who have and use their judgements. If bare pretences were sufficient, <hi>Simon Magus</hi> did bid the fairest to be <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Epiph. haer.</hi> 20.</note> for he pretended to be <hi>Gods Vicar upon earth,</hi> or <hi>the divine Power sent down from Heaven,</hi> which none of the Apostles pretended to. Why then did not the Christian Church submit to <hi>Montanus</hi> his <hi>Paraclete,</hi> when no other Christians pretended to such an immediate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration as he did? And certainly <hi>Prisca</hi> and <hi>Maximilla</hi> were better Oracles, than a <hi>Crucifix</hi> was to a late <hi>Pope.</hi> If there be any thing beyond a bare pretence to an infallible Spirit, we desire to see better arguments for it, than the <hi>false Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi> could produce for theirs; if there be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a bare pretence, we must leave the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Quakers</hi> to dispute it out.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the pretence to Divine Inspiration is very dangerous to the Christian Church. For we see what mischief it did in the Apostolical times, when there was a true infallible Spirit in the Apostles of Christ to discover and confute it; yet notwithstanding all the care and diligence of the Apostles many were seduced by it. For those


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55951:7"/>
who have the least ground, do commonly use the greatest confidence, and denounce <hi>Hell</hi> and <hi>dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> the soonest to those who despise and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject them. Which being expressed with a grim countenance and a terrible accent, startles and shakes more persons of weak judgements and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous dispositions, than all the reasons and arguments they could ever produce. This hath alwayes been the method of deceivers, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the highest, and then make the sin of those who do not believe them as great, as if the thing were real. Thus the rejecting mens Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natick pretences to Revelations and Extasies is cryed out upon, as blaspheming the <hi>Holy Ghost;</hi> and refusing to believe upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches pretended Infallibility, is called no less, than denying Gods Veracity. We profess to believe the true inspiration of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> and every tittle of what God hath revealed: but we will not swallow Pretences for Evidences, nor Enthusiasms for Revelations. For as the true Religion was at first founded upon Divine Inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; so we know that the greatest corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it have sprung from the pretence to it. <hi>Maimonides</hi> saith, that <hi>the first beginning of Pagan Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, was owing to the pretence of Inspiration,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Maim. de Idol. c.</hi> 1. <hi>sect.</hi> 3.</note> 
                     <hi>and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Revelations for the Worship of the Stars.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that be, we are certain the Devil made use of <hi>Oracles</hi> and <hi>Enthusiasms,</hi> as the most effectual


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55951:8"/>
means to bring men to the practice of it, both in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> in <hi>Greece</hi> and many other places; and they who have taken the pains to collect them, have reckoned one hundred and sixty several Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles that were in request in the times of Paganism. After Christianity began to be setled in the world, the greatest corrupters of it were the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders to Dinive Inspiration, as the false Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, the <hi>Gnosticks,</hi> the <hi>Montanists,</hi> and many others. And the pretence to this, is so much the more dangerous, because it bids high, and is easily taken up, and requires no learning or wit, but only confidence to manage it, and may carry men by impulses and motions to the most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable actions, and where it meets with an Enthusiastical temper, is very hardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We may observe, that a truly infallible Spirit is not sufficient to put an end to Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies. For when was that ever more evident than in the holy Apostles after the miraculous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent of the Holy Ghost upon them? Many are apt to say now, <hi>That there will never be an end of these wranglings, and Schisms, and disputes in Religion, till there be an infallible Judge to put an issue to them;</hi> But were there not infallible Judges in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles time, that gave infinitely greater evidence of an infallible Spirit, than any ever since have done? But were Controversies put to an


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55951:8"/>
end by it? No certainly, when the Apostles com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain so much of the Schisms, and divisions, and errors, and heresies, and disputes, and quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings that were among them. And if so great an evidence of a Divine Spirit manifested by their Miracles, had no greater effect then, what can we imagine the shadow of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> or the dream of infallibility can do in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church? And give me leave to say, it is the Inquisition and not Infallibility, which keep things quiet among them. But God deliver us from such an end of Controversies.</p>

               <div n="2" type="pretense">
                  <p>2. The false Prophets and Apostles pretended to greater mortification and self-denyal than the true Apostles did S <hi>Hierom</hi> understands their coming in <hi>Sheeps clothing,</hi>

                     </note> of this pretence <hi>to greater severity, and rigour of life</hi> than others used. Those that go about to deceive, must appear to have something extraordinary this way, to raise an admiration of them among those who judge of Saints more by their <hi>looks,</hi> than by their <hi>actions.</hi> Whereas the greatest Hypocrites have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the greatest pretenders this way. Our blessed Saviour was so far from making any shew of this rigour and severity, that he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached by the Scribes and Pharisees, those mortified Saints, <hi>to be a wine-bibber, a friend to Publicans and Sinners.</hi> Alas! what heavenly looks, and devout gestures, and long prayers, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55951:9"/>
fastings had they more than Christ or his Disciples? The poor Widows were so ravished with their long prayers, that they thought they could not do better with their houses or estates, than to put them into the hands of such morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied men to the world: till they found, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing <hi>their Sheeps clothing,</hi> that by their <hi>devouring they were ravening Wolves.</hi> Those that seem so much to fly from the world, do but as Souldiers in a Battel sometimes do, that seem to fly from their enemies, but only with a design to make them follow, that they may have the more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage upon them. One would think no men were so afraid of the world, as they that seem to run so fast from it, but they lay their Ambus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cado's to entrap it; and if once it gets into their hand, no men know better how to be revenged upon it. What pleasant incongruities are these? to see men grow rich by Vows of Poverty, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired from the world, and yet the most unquiet and busie in it? Mortified to the pleasures of life, and yet delighting most in following the Courts of Princes? Such kind of men were the <hi>Pharisees</hi> of old: and who would have thought, that under the Name of that <hi>Jesus,</hi> who so much detested and abhorred their hypocrisie, there should others arise, who have outdone them in their own way? As though Christ had said, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept your righteousness be like the righteousness of the


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55951:9"/>
Scribes and Pharisees, ye shall not enter in the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> But we need not wonder that in these lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ages such pretences should be made use of, since in the very beginning of the Christian Church, these were the common arts of deceivers. They found fault with the Apotles, as giving too much liberty to men in the use of Marriage and Meats; but they thought the state of the one was not agreeable to their sanctity, nor the free use of the other consistent with their severe and mortified life. <hi>For they did forbid to marry,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.3.</note> 
                     <hi>and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to abstain from meats.</hi> They would not make use of the liberty which God had allowed, but they were ready to take that which he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden: therefore the Apostle gives the true cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of them when he saith, <hi>they spake lyes in hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie.</hi> There was an outward shew of sanctity and severity in their doctrine; but no men are observed by <hi>Ecclesiastical Historians</hi> to have been more eager of what God had forbidden, than they who were so scrupulous about what God had allowed. We do not say, the case is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the same, <hi>where men are forbidden absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as though Marriage were unlawful in it self</hi>; which was the case of the antient Hereticks; and <hi>where it is forbidden only to a particular Order of men,</hi> as it is in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>: but this we say, that where it is forbidden to <hi>a particular Order of men,</hi> as though it did not become the


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55951:10"/>
                     <hi>sanctity</hi> of that <hi>Order</hi>; this is reviving that hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie which S. <hi>Paul</hi> condemns: especially when it is forbidden on such an account as Pope <hi>Siricius</hi> did it,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Siric. Ep.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 7.</note> 
                     <hi>because they that are in the flesh cannot please God</hi>; which is in effect sending all married persons to Hell.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ep.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 9.</note> This was one part of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended mortification of false Teachers about Marriage, the other was about Meats. S. <hi>Paul</hi> knew no such holiness in one sort of Meat above another, as though men could fast their bellies full of one, but the least taste of the other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed it. What a pleasant thing it is to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that fasting, which the unmortified <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures</hi> of old accounted their most delicious feast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>viz.</hi> Fish and Wine! This is not doing so much as the Pharisees did,<note place="margin">Mat. 6.17.</note> for they <hi>appeared unto men to fast</hi>: but in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be said to do that, unless fasting and eating be the same thing. <hi>But may not the Church call not eating prohibited meat fasting?</hi> No doubt it may; as well as call that no bread, which we see, and taste, and handle to be bread. However I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not understand, but if their Church had so pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the eating Flesh and abstaining from Fish might have been called fasting; and so they might have made one entire Fast of a whole years eating: and notwithstanding all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of fasting and mortification in that Church, I cannot see that any man is bound by the Laws


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55951:10"/>
of it, to keep one <hi>true fast</hi> all the dayes of his life. But if all the mortification required, lyes only <hi>in a distinction of meats,</hi> the false <hi>Apostles</hi> went beyond them in it; for they utterly forbid some sorts, saying, <hi>touch not, taste not, handle not</hi>; and not meerly to shew their obedience to the commands of the Church,<note place="margin">Col. 2.24.</note> but that they might not gratifie the desires of the flesh, and therefore the Apostle saith,<note place="margin">V. 23.$</note> 
                     <hi>these things</hi> had on that account <hi>a shew of wisdom in them</hi>; being in all probability taken from the severe precepts of the <hi>Pythagorean</hi> Philosophy, which makes him bid them,<note place="margin">V. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>Beware lest they were spoiled through Philosophy and vain deceit, after the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of men, and the principles of the world, and not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Christ.</hi> For if this sort of <hi>mortification</hi> were a thing so pleasing to God, the <hi>Heathen</hi> princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were more agreeable to his nature, than the doctrine of <hi>Christianity.</hi> This only requires the subduing our inward lusts, and in order to that, to keep the body in subjection; but in the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of the <hi>Heaten</hi> Religion far greater se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verities were to be undergone, in order to their participation of them. And the hardships were so great in some of their initiations, especially those of <hi>Mithras,</hi> that some dyed before they could pass through them: and yet for any to be admitted without them, was present death to them. They were <hi>to make confession of their sins, shave their heads, change their habits, lye

upon the bare ground, fast for several dayes, and when they eat, it was to be only of some certain meats</hi>; these and many other <hi>severities</hi> they were to go through in order to the purifying their souls, as they thought, and bringing them to the state they were in before they came into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Some part of these hardships the <hi>Pythagore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> took into their <hi>Philosophy</hi>; and from them the <hi>Colossians</hi> began to be infected with them: but S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls them only <hi>vain deceits, the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and doctrines of men, things that made a fair shew,</hi> but he looks upon them as corruptions of the doctrine of Christ. Yet afterwards the <hi>Montanists</hi> and <hi>Encratitae</hi> and others were much stricter and more frequent in these fasts and abstinence, than the Catholick Christians; but the Church thought fit to condemn them, as corrupters of Christianity.

They would not hurt a limb of them for all the world! No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but meer zeal for their good, could make them run such hazards, and venture so much as they do!

Thus, if the <hi>Wolves</hi> may be believed, there is no danger to the <hi>Sheep,</hi> but from their <hi>Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds</hi>: let them but forsake them, and then see what admirable love, and peace, and unity they would live together in: but the <hi>Apostle</hi> well adds to all this, <hi>deceiving the hearts of the simple,</hi> for none else are capable of being thus deceived, by all their fair pretences and plausible insinuations.</p>

All the blessedness our Saviour promises, is to the humble and contrite, to the meek and righteous, to the merciful, pure and peaceable: but if others make easier conditions of blessedness, no wonder if their doctrine be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained by those who are willing to be happy, but unwilling to leave their sins. As if false


<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55951:14"/>
Teachers should turn our Saviours Beatitudes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to such as these: <hi>Blessed are ye, if ye confess your sins to a Priest, and receive the Sacrament of Penance, for your sins are forgiven. Blessed are ye, if ye vow po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, and leave the world; for ye shall inherit the earth. Blessed are ye, if ye go in Pilgrimages, and visit the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Churches (especially in a year of Iubilee, and receive the Popes benediction) for ye shall be called the Children of God. Blessed are ye, if ye do or suffer evil for the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Churches sake; for great shall be your reward in Heaven. Blessed are they, that howsoever they live, dye in S.</hi> Francis <hi>his habit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> For so <hi>Gregory</hi> the ninth saith, that S. <hi>Francis obtained this priviledge of God,</hi>

Besides, that which makes the way to Heaven more narrow, is that our Saviour declares, <hi>he came not to destroy the Law, but to fulfill it</hi>: and adds precepts of his own to it: But do not they make the way to Heaven much opener, that teach men to dissolve both the Law and the Precepts of Christ? For this is the language of these false Teachers, if we bring their doctrine to the manner of our Saviours expressions. <q>Ye have heard, that it hath been said of old, <hi>Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou

Ye have heard, that it hath been said by them of old time; <hi>Thou shalt not make to thy self any graven Image, nor the likeness of any thing,</hi> &amp;c. but we say unto you, that this Command may be left out among Christians.

If <hi>Christ</hi> had ever intended to have left such a <hi>Vicar upon Earth,</hi> whose judgement all Christians are bound to follow, he would never have put them to such a needless tryal of mens Doctrines by their Fruits: the short and plain way had been to have said thus, <hi>There will false Teachers arise, but remember that you are to obey and follow the Bishop of</hi> Rome; <hi>and if you will be saved, I command you to hold in communion with him.</hi> This had been the fullest and clearest direction in the world, and no doubt, if our <hi>blessed Saviour</hi> had meant any such thing, such was his care of the souls of men, this would have been one of the first and plainest pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the Gospel. But so dark and obscure, so remote and impertinent are the proofs brought from <hi>Scripture</hi> for the <hi>Popes Supremacy,</hi> that I dare say, that <hi>Aristotles Politicks</hi> do prove it much better than any Text in the Bible: and those I suppose

have been of my opinion, who slightly passing over the passages of <hi>Scripture,</hi> have been large in proving, that <hi>Monarchy is the best Government,</hi> and therefore ought to be in the Church. Which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument if it have any force for an <hi>Universal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy</hi> in the Church, I should not at all wonder to see the same persons zealous to promote an <hi>Universal Monarchy</hi> in the World too.

                  <hi>the Sun</hi> and <hi>the Moon</hi>: I hope the same reason, which will prove it necessary for the <hi>Sun to rule the day,</hi> will equally hold, that <hi>the Moon should rule the night.</hi> And I shall easily agree, that when it will be thought reasonable for all the Kings and Princes in the world to submit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to one <hi>Universal Monarch,</hi> it may be then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for all particular Churches, to give up their rights to the Pope. In the mean time we think it most convenient to follow our Saviours Rules, to judge of mens pretences, how great and haughty soever, by the <hi>fruits</hi> they produce. Which <hi>Rule</hi> is not to be understood concerning the <hi>particular actions of men</hi> which have no respect to their <hi>doctrines</hi>; for as S. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> observes, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Hereticks have been men of excellent lives, and so on the contrary; but we are to understand it of those <hi>fruits</hi> which their doctrines have a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect influence upon. And therefore this Rule


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:55951:16"/>
hath a particular respect to two things by which we are to examine the fairest pretences: <hi>viz.</hi> 1. The <hi>design</hi> they tend to. 2. The <hi>means</hi> made use of for the accomplishing this design. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>design</hi> be quite of another nature from that of the <hi>Gospel</hi>; if the <hi>means</hi> be such as are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to it, we may from thence justly inferr, that how plausible soever the pretences are, how fine and soft soever <hi>the Sheeps clothing</hi> be, yet inwardly <hi>they are ravening Wolves.</hi>
               </p>
               <div n="1" type="pretense">
                  <p>1. I begin therefore, with the <hi>design</hi> of their doctrines. Nothing is more easie, than for men to understand the design of Christianity, <hi>viz.</hi> the exercise of all Christian vertues to fit men for the Kingdom of Heaven: for our Saviour declares, <hi>That his Kingdom is not of this world;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 18.36.</note> that he came not to meddle with the rights of Princes, or to dispose of Crowns and Dominions; all that he aimed at, was to possess men with a firm belief of another world, and by the most powerful mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to perswade men to repentance, and a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, righteous, and a godly life. And if they did these things, what ever troubles and difficulties they met with in this world, should be abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly recompensed in that to come. This is the main scope and design of the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and the great art of the <hi>false Prophets</hi> lay in this, that they pretended still to own Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, (which was their <hi>Sheeps clothing</hi>) but withal


<pb n="30" facs="tcp:55951:17"/>
by secret and pernicious mixtures of their own doctrines to undermine and pervert the whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of it. So S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith of them, not that they did oppose, but that they did <hi>pervert the Gospel of Christ. I marvel,</hi> saith he, <hi>that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ to another Gospel</hi>:<note place="margin">Gal. 16.7.</note> 
                     <hi>which yet is not another, but there be some that trouble you; and would pervert the Gospel of Christ.</hi> Now I desire, it may be considered, whether any thing doth more effectually pervert the design of the Gospel, than the setting up a Kingdom in this world under the pretence of it, that should be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramount to all Princes and Potentates, and to which they owe subjection and obedience? And yet this hath been the open and avowed design of the prevailing Faction in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> for the last six hundred years. I do not deny but there were some tendencies to it before, and wise men might easily guess what it would come to, if the design came once to be managed by a man of Spirit and courage, as it was by <hi>Gregory</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, who in a Council at <hi>Rome</hi> published his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Dictates, viz. <hi>That there is but one Name in the World,</hi>

                        <hi>Baron. An.</hi> 1076. <hi>Sect.</hi> 31.</note> viz. <hi>that of the Pope: that it was in his power to depose Emperours, and absolve Subjects from obedience to their Princes.</hi> Now the grand design breaking out, all other things were contrived and carried on which were thought necessary to accomplish it: and there being two things needful for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:55951:17"/>
of such a pretended Monarchy, <hi>viz. suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient numbers</hi> of men, whose interest should lye in upholding it; and great revenues to support the dignity of it: These two were taken care of with all the art and industry imaginable. For the first, it was necessary to disengage them from all Civil interests, and yet to preserve their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and reputation with the people. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer could not be done while the Clergy gave hostages of their fidelity to the Civil Government by the interest of their Families and Children, therefore this Pope did most severely forbid all Clergy mens marrying; that as the old <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers were forbidden marriage while they received pay, lest their domestick interests should abate their courage; so the <hi>Celibate</hi> of the Clergy was strictly enjoyned, to make them more use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and hearty for this design. But lest the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of these should not be thought sufficient, great swarms of <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Friers</hi> were encouraged and dispersed in all Countreys, and to make them more faithful to this interest (because Princes might oblige particular Bishops who might curb and restrain these spiritual <hi>Ianizaries)</hi> therefore they were exempt from their jurisdiction, and kept in immediate dependence on the Pope. To give yet further encouragement to both Orders, the Doctrine of <hi>Ecclesiastical Liberty</hi> was set on foot; not a liberty from the <hi>Law of Moses,</hi> or the <hi>power of


<pb n="32" facs="tcp:55951:18"/>
Sin,</hi> or the <hi>dominion of Satan,</hi> which is all the <hi>Liberty</hi> the <hi>Gospel</hi> speaks of; but an exemption from the power of the Civil Magistrate; in so much, that the Popish <hi>Casuists</hi> determine, that <hi>Rebellion in a Clergy-man is no Treason, because he is not subject to the Civil power.</hi> And this doctrine of Liberty is no invention of the <hi>Iesuits</hi>; but it is determined by the famous <hi>Councils</hi> of <hi>Constance, Lateran,</hi>

But that no designs might be carried on, which they should not understand, never was there such an inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to that purpose, as <hi>Auricular Confession</hi>: and yet that the people may have greater reverence to their Priests, they are told, that they can make


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:55951:18"/>
their God at any time by pronouncing the Five Words of Consecration. And what cannot they do, (as one of them bravely said) while they have their God in their hands, and their Prince on his knees? And both these doctrines of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi> and <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> were defined by the same Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the third, a man of the same spirit and undertakings with <hi>Gregory</hi> the seventh. And lastly, that no supplies should be wanting to support the Grandeur of the <hi>Papal See,</hi> besides the pretended Donations and Concessions of Princes, all arts imaginable were used to drain money out of all Countreys in subjection to the Pope, and to empty <hi>it into</hi> the Popes Treasury. This very Kingdom of ours was a remarkable instance of this, during its Vassallage under the Popes Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny. For an account being taken in <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighths time, it was found, that in the compass of forty years foregoing,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Antiq. Brit. A.D.</hi> 1532.</note> no less a sum than 160000 <hi>l.</hi> was carried to <hi>Rome</hi> upon the sole account of Investiture of Bishops, besides the vast summs that were raised by <hi>Peter-pence, Dispensations</hi> and <hi>Indulgences,</hi> which were a kind of Contribution upon the sins of the People. Thus we see, how the design was laid and managed for an <hi>Universal Monarchy</hi> in the Church. But some will say, <hi>that the world is grown wiser now.</hi> I heartily wish it were so; for nothing would be more prejudicial to the <hi>Papal Interest,</hi> than its being so. But let us not


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:55951:19"/>
deceive our selves, the pretensions are as high and as great at <hi>Rome</hi> to this <hi>Monarchy</hi> as ever they were. And what ever some vainly distinguish <hi>of the Court and Church of Rome</hi> in this matter, it is certain those of the <hi>Court of Rome</hi> not only assert, but prove it too, that this doctrine hath been the doctrine of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> for six hundred years; and they produce for it besides a great number of Authors no fewer than ten <hi>Councils,</hi> whereof two are allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them to be <hi>general, viz.</hi> those of <hi>Lyons</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teran.</hi> But this is not all, but they contend for it not as a probable opinion, but as a thing certain and of faith, and that not barely at <hi>Rome,</hi> but even in <hi>France.</hi> For in the memory of many yet alive, after a hot debate in a general Assembly of the three E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states at <hi>Paris,</hi>

But not the least tittle of all this was pretended, by the most enraged of them: nothing but <hi>Zeal for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and the Catholick Cause,</hi> was ever pleaded by them.

If they go on in this way without the least shadow of proof to lay the contrivance of this Plot on a <hi>professed Protestant</hi>: for all that I know, by the next age, they may hope to perswade men, that it was a Plot of <hi>Protestants</hi> to blow up a <hi>Popish King</hi> and <hi>Parliament.</hi>

But suppose it had been <hi>in confession</hi>; why might not <hi>Treason</hi> be discovered as well as <hi>Heresie?</hi> and their <hi>Casuists</hi> acknowledge, that <hi>Heresie</hi> may be revealed.

Yea, so bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie were the <hi>Iesuits</hi> in encouraging this Plot, that they not only debated it among themselves; but one of them gave them the Sacrament upon the <hi>Oath of Secrecy,</hi> and then absolved them after the discovery; another prayed for good success, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther comforted them after it was discovered by the examples of good designs that had wanted success. And must we after all this believe, that only <hi>a few discontented Laicks</hi> were engaged in it, and that it was nothing at all to their Church? when the <hi>Iesuits</hi> gave all the encouragement to them in it, in point of conscience: so that it was truly, as well as wittily said of one, That the <hi>Iesuits double garment</hi> might well be called <hi>Charity, because it cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a multitude of sins.</hi>

seems then, their principles are dangerous to Princes where they have it not. What mark of dishonour was there set by their own part on any one of the Conspirators? Two of the <hi>Iesuits</hi> upon their arrival at <hi>Rome,</hi> met with such hard usage, that one was made the <hi>Popes Poenitentiary,</hi> the other a <hi>Confessor</hi> in S. <hi>Peters</hi> at <hi>Rome.</hi> And is not this the way to let the world see, how detestable such persons and practices are to their Church? To conclude all, I challenge those of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church to produce any one solemn Declaration of that Church, (I do not say of Secular Powers or some particular persons, or Councils rejected at <hi>Rome</hi>) whereby they make it unlawful for the Pope to depose Princes, or to absolve Subjects from their Oaths of Allegiance to them. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of that, even in this present age of ours, that opinion which makes it unlawful, hath been condemned at <hi>Rome</hi> by three several Popes, <hi>Paul</hi> the Fifth, <hi>Innocent</hi> the Tenth, and <hi>Alexander</hi> the Seventh: and which is more considerable, all three have condemned it with a particular respect to the case of His Majesties Subjects; and not meerly condemned it as a false opinion, but <hi>as wicked and contrary to faith.</hi> And <hi>is not the world grown wiser now,</hi> as to these matters? But if they be not, I hope we may be. And after their frequent Treasons and horrible Conspiracies, and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, never disowned by their Church, have we
