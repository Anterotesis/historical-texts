            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I am now before I proceede to the other chiefe Citties, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member in a word, how and when the <hi>Florentines</hi> came impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronized of diuers other states of <hi>Tuscany,</hi> and what forme of gouerment they had in former times, vntill <hi>Leo</hi> and <hi>Clement,</hi> for I must there needs begin, when I shall come to speake of the great Dukes title.</p>
            <p>This Cittie of <hi>Florence,</hi> after many conflicts with the olde Citty of <hi>Fesulae,</hi> (whereof now almost remaineth no memory, but the hilles whereon it stood) getting the vpper hand, and many of that olde towne following the fortune of the winner, comming hither to dwell, it grew to beare the name of a great and rich Cittie: which till then (euer since the time of <hi>Sylla,</hi> by whom they say it was first founded and made a Collony of the <hi>Romaines</hi>) bare rather the name of a Bourough, then otherwise. And after a combination of these two Citties into one Commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty, they quartered the Armes of <hi>Fesulae,</hi> which were a Moone Azure in a field Argent, with those of <hi>Florence,</hi> being a <hi>Flower de Lise</hi> Argent in a field Gules.

to eight <hi>Priori,</hi> and a <hi>Gonfalonier</hi> of Iustice, who was to hold his place for 2. moneths only.

The gouerment of a <hi>Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falonier</hi> was altered by <hi>Gualteri Francese</hi> Duke of <hi>Athens,</hi> who at the Citties request requiring aide, was sent thither by <hi>Robert</hi> king of <hi>Sicilie,</hi> and at his first comming deposed the <hi>Gonfalonier</hi> and <hi>Priory,</hi> &amp; vsurped himselfe; but he was quickly expulsed, and the former officer reinuested: till the time of Pope <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the sixt, whose sonne <hi>Casar Borgia</hi> duke <hi>Valentinois</hi> sought to bring in the three banished <hi>Medici, Piero, Giouanni,</hi> and <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liano</hi>; wherevpon the <hi>Florentines</hi> made <hi>Piero Sederini</hi> their <hi>Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falonier</hi> perpetuall, as <hi>Buonacorsi</hi> an approued <hi>Italian</hi> writer, &amp; <hi>Guicciardine</hi> in his fist booke doth testifie.

            <p>This Towne pretendeth to be much priuiledged aboue all other Citties vnder the great Duke, for at the time when they yeelded to the State of <hi>Florence,</hi> it was among other Capitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons concluded; that in any <hi>Bando</hi> (Proclamation) whatsoeuer except the Cittie and <hi>Contado</hi> of <hi>Pistoia</hi> were expresly named, it was to be vnderstood exempt &amp; freed from the same, which indeed is still obserued, howbeit a course is taken neuer to leaue
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:9711:12"/>
that clause out: so that I see small reason they haue to bragge so much thereof. The people in and without the Citty are sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed sixtie foure thousand: the Religious are much about the the rate of them in <hi>Prato</hi> an eight part.</p>
            <p>I cannot passe the direct way from hence to <hi>Pisa,</hi> whether the course of this discourse directs me, vnlesse I passe vnder the walles of <hi>Lucca</hi>: which being no part of this State, I know not how I may speake of; that haue vndertaken to write of nothing else: and yet passing so neare, I know not how to auoide some mention thereof, that am likewise to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertise of what I haue seene. Wherefore betweene a doubt which is lesse fault, to digresse in my narration, or be diuerted out of my way, I will speake so little, as if it be a fault to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse, it may be excused, because this little is nothing, &amp; if it be a fault to write so little, it may be answered I durst not digresse.</p>

It is seated (as is before said) like a Center in a Circumference, in the middest of a faire and pleasant valley, enuironed with wast and huge Mountaines: The walles in circuite two miles, are of Brick very new, strengthned with a very thick Rampart, and fortified <hi>alla moderna,</hi> with very many and defensible Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warkes. Insomuch as it is thought, that when the Bulwarke that is now in the making at the North-west of the towne is fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, with one other at the East which is already purposed, and the <hi>Terra-pieno</hi> (Rampart) of this East side made answerable to the rest, which is also intended, it shall then haue in all, eleuen Bulwarkes, and will without exception be one of the best for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified townes in <hi>Italy.</hi> They keepe in the towne a garrison con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually of three hundred Souldiers, and are able (they say) to drawe into their Cittie at two daies warning out of their owne territorie, thirtie thousand able me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for seruice; for which nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber

they haue prouision of armes, victuals, and all things necessary vpon occasion. I was in their Granaries, where I saw, as they credibly rated it of Wheate, Rie, Beanes, and Chestnut Mealn the quantitie of six hundred thousand Staies, which of our measure maketh about fifty thousand quarters, besides so much more kept in diuers conuents and Monasteries of the towne which they call their <hi>Prouisione d' Abondanza</hi> (store). All which prouision is able (in case of a Siege) to maintaine the Citty for two yeares, at the number of three-score thousand people, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing twelue Staies a man the yeare; a proportion in those parts, and such cases very large. The reasons of these fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, garrisons, and prouisions which they make, is the iealous feare they haue of the great Duke, of whom all their State which is somewayes fiftie miles in length is euery way enuiro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, whose greatnesse is nothing pleasing to the <hi>Lucchesi</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can they well digest that his title (<hi>di Toscana</hi>) and therfore the <hi>Signoria</hi> of this State, sending letters of congratulation (they say) but it is more probable about some other their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires to <hi>Cosmo Medici,</hi> presently after his creation of great Duke, they stiled their letters thus. <hi>All' Ilsmo e Ec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Implying that it is no reason he should be intitled great Duke of the whole, hauing no more but the one halfe, But how sooner this towne stand <hi>prouista</hi> as it braggeth, and are able to keepe him out of themselues two or three yeares together, more then probable it is, that the feare of the <hi>Spanish</hi> King, to whose pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection it is recommended, doth curbe his desire in attempting the action, watching ouer this prety State with an ambitious and couetous eye, <hi>come Lo sparuicre alla quaglia,</hi> as the Hauke ouer the Quaile, hoping one day for an oppertunitie.</p>

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:9711:13"/>
as there are not iudged aboue fourteteene thousand persons, though in circuite it be little lesse then <hi>Florence:</hi> the Walles for the most part are of Bricke, but in some places of square Stone, the Ramparts conuenient, the Bulwarkes not many nor corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondent: the peece of cheefest import is the Castle vpon the South-west of the towne, wherein is a garrison of fiftie, with munition and other necessaries, for the vse as is abouesaid of keeping the Citty in awe. The scite hereof is in a Plaine vpon the Riuer <hi>Arno,</hi> which passeth through the middest therof with one bridge onely, and falleth into the Sea some sixe miles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe; whereby it appeareth that the land hath lately gotten much vpon the Sea on this coast, as we finde in diuers places vpon our coast in England, for that in the time of <hi>Strabo</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth, it was but twenty furlongs off, which is two miles and a halfe distant from the Sea.</p>
            <p>Out of this Riuer is cut a Ditch from this Towne to <hi>Linor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> fifteene miles long, for the more conuenient carriage of such wares as arriue in that Roade, and are thence conueyed by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from <hi>Pisa</hi> vp to <hi>Florence</hi>; and so by land into other places of <hi>Tuscany, Romagna, Lombardia,</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> also. The Boates wherein these wares are carried are but small, in number be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene six and seauen hundred, which our English Marchants <hi>Burlando</hi> (gibing) call the great Dukes fleete. The nature of this plaine is for the most part marish, though in times past it was fit either for pasture or tillage, as by the commoditie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reaped for the maintenance of the cittie appeareth by <hi>Guic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciard.</hi> But since that the Cittie being conquered by the <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,</hi> and most of the auncient <hi>Pisani</hi> departed, some into <hi>Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> other into <hi>Sardegna, Corsica,</hi> and other places, preferring a voluntary bannishment, before a forced subiection: the Towne hath beene so desolate as there haue not beene people suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to maintaine this plaine against the fury of <hi>Arno,</hi> whereby it hath beene much wasted, as hath partly beene said.</p>
            <p>There are, besides the commodity of the seat, lying betweene <hi>Florence</hi> and <hi>Lyuorno,</hi> three other causes, that this Cittie is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented, otherwise it would be very desolate. The first is the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:9711:13"/>
especially fauour of the Prince himselfe, who because he was here borne, beareth an extraordinary affection to the place, as by his often comming and long tarrying appeareth. Another is, for that it is the place where properly the order of <hi>S. Stephen</hi> is resident, where the Knights of this order haue their Pallace, Officers, and other dependances. The last, for that there is a studie as they call it in <hi>Italy</hi> (a Vniuersity) erected by <hi>Cosmo,</hi> and is reasonably frequented.</p>
            <p>In this Towne among many other Churches and Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, is that excellent Fabrick of the <hi>Battisterio,</hi> built (they say) in fourteene dayes: It standeth hard at the West-end of the <hi>Duomo,</hi> which for the beauty thereof might haue compared with that of <hi>Siena</hi> so much commended, had it not by mishap beene burned in the yeare 1595. in October; it is now in the repairing at the great Dukes charges: Howbeit in liew hereof, he hath raised the price of his Salt fiue. <hi>Quatrini</hi> in the pound, throughout this State for the space of ten yeares: and it is to be thought (by examples too many of like nature in other places) that being once grauted, it shall not then be ended. On the North of this Church is the <hi>Campo Santu,</hi> as they call it, their <hi>Golgetha</hi> or place of buriall, the earth whereof was brought in ships from the <hi>Terrasanta,</hi> as their Histories record: &amp; as they affirme, the dead consume there in foure and twenty hou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Not farre from this place is an old ruinous Tower, called by them <hi>(Torre di fame)</hi> in memory of the mercylesse crueltie of <hi>Ruggiero</hi> the Archbishop, who vpon suspition of treason im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured therein <hi>Conte Hugolino</hi> a Noble <hi>Pisano,</hi> and his foure children, causing them to be starued: of whom <hi>Dante</hi> the Poet in his 33. chapter <hi>dell'inferno,</hi> very elegantly discourseth, fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that there for a torment due to such a fact, the <hi>Conte</hi> li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

looking for great praise at the Dukes hands for his rare plotte, and finding after that it disliked his Highnesse, in a melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie discontent threw himselfe into the <hi>Arno:</hi> he hath also ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lesser house lately built, wherein are many small Statues of Marble and Mettall, many Medalles and Pictures, some pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, others of Feathers very exquisitely artificiall. Besides pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Vre vntried both of golde &amp; siluer, Corall vnpollished, whereof yee shall see some growe vpon the Sculles of dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, with infinite such like, more delightfull to be seene, then needfull to be related of. Vnto this building is adioyning a Garden of Simples, not much inferiour to that of <hi>Padoa:</hi> But the thing of best vse and greatest cost, and therefore vnfittest to be forgotten, is a Conduict of water vpon Arches into the Towne from <hi>Valdeculci</hi> fiue mile off, where with the better part of the Cittie is serued. Other buildings I remember not, worth the remembring; except the <hi>Campanile,</hi> which Architecture hath this varietie, that the top thereof by a line perpendicularly downe-falling to the ground, and sheweth that it is prominent or hanging ouer the <hi>Basis</hi> ten or twelue foote by the square. As for the Cittie it selfe, it is the greater halfe voide, wherein is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Gardens of hearbes and rootes; the houses that there be, are for the most part so old and ruinous, as that the great Duke hath lately giuen commandement, that euery one accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his abilitie should either build new, or at the least re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire and trim them on the out-sides for the better grace of the towne. So vnlike is <hi>Pisa</hi> to it selfe; which in former times was able to wage battaile at land with the <hi>Florentines,</hi> at Sea with the <hi>Genoese</hi>; yea and with <hi>Venice</hi> also: And before that, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quere <hi>Sardigna,</hi> to ouercome the King of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and bring him prisoner to <hi>Rome,</hi> to recouer <hi>Palermo</hi> in <hi>Sicilia</hi> from the <hi>Sarazens,</hi> to assist the <hi>French</hi> with a mighty Nauie in their voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to the holy land, to send fortie ships to the recouery of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria</hi> for <hi>Almerick</hi> King of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> to aide th'Emperour <hi>Frederick Barbarossa</hi> against the state of <hi>Millan</hi>; besides many other their famous and victorious conquests; wherevpon one saith: <hi>Erat Pisa, altera Roma fuim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>To speake of the diuers gouerments of this Towne and the many alterations it hath suffered, were a discourse, though not altogether needlesse or impertinent, yet so large or rather tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as would be altogether disproportionate to my former bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie: I will leaue it therefore altogether vntouched, and go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward my iourney to <hi>Siena.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Cittie chalengeth the title of much Antiquitie,<note place="margin">Siena.</note> being built by <hi>Sanesius</hi> the sonne of <hi>Remus, Romulus</hi> his brother, which may seeme to carry some matter of truth, for that the Armes of the Cittie is a Wolfe, with two Infants sucking vpon her: which Armes are to be seene in diuers places of the Towne both in Marble and Mettall. It is called by <hi>Pliny, Colonia Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nensis,</hi> and by <hi>Tacitus</hi> in the 20. booke of his Historie, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was built by <hi>Sanesius,</hi> or the <hi>Galli Senones</hi> that went with <hi>Brennus</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> I leaue indifferent to the Reader: this last is alleaged out of <hi>Ptolomies</hi> Fables, though I rather subscribe to the former. It is seated vpon the tops of diuers small hils, very neerely meeting together, which with their declinings makes the Scituation very vneuen, and such as I haue not else-where seene: by reason whereof it is iudged infinitely strong, as not hauing any commanding hill neere, whereby it might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudiced, nor any way by which forces may be brought before it; saue onely at the two gates towards <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Florence:</hi> &amp; yet there so narrow, as there cannot possibly come aboue ten Souldiers <hi>alla filata</hi> in rancke. So that as <hi>Liuorno</hi> is the key by which all forces must passe that by Sea would approach <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> so is <hi>Siena</hi> the Porte or gate by which they must enter, that eyther from <hi>Naples</hi> or the Churches state would come to anoye it. For from the way of <hi>Romagna</hi> or <hi>Bologna,</hi> there is very hard passage for an Armie, so sharpe and inaccessible are the mountaines, which being well considered by <hi>Cosmo</hi> (then Duke) of <hi>Florence,</hi> no maruaile though he neuer rested till he had got the towne and whole state of <hi>Siena</hi> into his hands.</p>
            <p>The meanes thus; The Cittie about fortie fiue yeares since, being besieged by the forces of the Pope, <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:9711:15"/>
               <hi>Cosmo</hi> Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> rendred it selfe at length to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and receaued a garrison of <hi>Spaniards,</hi> but keeping still their manner of gouerment which they before vsed. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour by earnest sollicitation of the D. <hi>d'Alua,</hi> in whom the Duke of <hi>Florence</hi> his purse (they say) had got him great interest, was content to render it into the Duke of <hi>Florence</hi> his possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for certaine summes of money to be paid, besides a yearely rent, with a recognition that it was holden of him, and certaine other couenants which some say were neuer performed, as also that this contract was made without the consent of <hi>Philip</hi> king of <hi>Spaine</hi> that now is, whereof were not his hands full of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in other places, it is thought some stirre might arise. So that <hi>Cosmo de' Medici</hi> the second Duke of <hi>Florence</hi> vnited that state with this of <hi>Siena,</hi> which is by estimation bigger then the state of <hi>Millan,</hi> and the most fruitefull part of all <hi>Tuscany.</hi> Wherevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he altered his Stile which before was <hi>Dux Florentiae,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled himselfe <hi>Dux Florentiae &amp; Senarum.</hi>

            <p>For the first I can auow, that going vp with another English Gentleman to the top of a steepe hill, some two miles high right ouer <hi>Prato,</hi> to giue our eye the view of that pleasant valley, we could not discerne any one peece of ground aboue one Acre and a halfe in our opinions, (except the great Dukes pastures about his Pallace of <hi>Poggio</hi>) all which ground being bare and the hedges greene with the Vines, gaue a very pleasant and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull prospect, resembling very fitly a Checker table. Now if the good Starres raise one of them to the fortune to be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed of one of these garden-plots, and a <hi>Cappanuccia</hi> (a silly shelter couered with Reedes) thervpon yee shall neuer get him from the discourse of his <hi>Villa,</hi> his <hi>Podere,</hi> and his <hi>Entrata,</hi> his farmes, his lands, and his rents; that one would thinke him Lord of some goodly Pallace, and as much land at the least as a Nag might well pace about in a day; when, if we come to see it, it prooues not God knowes aboue the <hi>Giornata</hi> (a dayes iourney) of a Snaile, and she poore beast is taken <hi>domage fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant</hi> in danger to be seazed vpon to the Lords vse of the soile; for Snailes, Frogs, Hedg-hogs, and such like, are accounted among the <hi>Delicatezze,</hi> the delicates of <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for their diligence in digging, setting, sowing, manuring and weeding of their ground, it is such as therewith the Dutch diligence in their Roote grounds may not compare. And lastly for the variety of those commodities which these Valleys yeelde, it shall suffice to comprehend them vnder these three heads; Fruite, Herbage, and Graine, with particular mention of such as I remember, howbeit in <hi>Italian</hi> names, because many of them growe not, nor are yet Christened in England.</p>

            <p>Another helpe is their egregious &amp; incredible <hi>Parsimony</hi> in feeding, as also their frugality from extraordinary spending, for should they either fare, or exceed in other charges, as we do in this cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey, it were impossible but their state should be ruined.</p>
            <p>Concerning Herbage,<note place="margin">Hearbes &amp; Rootes.</note> I shall not need to speake, but that it is the most generall food of the <hi>Tuscan,</hi> at whose table a Sallet is as ordinary, as Salt at ours; for being eaten of all sorts of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, &amp; at all times of the yeare: of the riche because they loue to spare; of the poore, because they cannot choose; of many Religious, because of their vow, of most others because of their want: it remaineth to beleeue that which themselues confesse; namely,<note place="margin">Flesh.</note> that for euery horse-load of flesh eaten, there is ten cart loades of hearbes and rootes, which also their open Markets and priuate tables doe witnesse, and whereof if one talke with them fasting, he shall haue sencible feeling.</p>
            <p>But for the better proofe of the little flesh here spent, it shall not be amisse to remember what the Chancellor of <hi>Prato</hi> told me concerning this matter, who seemed by his discourse a man of good vnderstanding, &amp; who ought by his office to haue the knowledge hereof very familiar; vpon some conference with him had about the great Dukes impositions and <hi>Gabell</hi> which he had in that state, he tolde me among diuers other matters, which shalbe remembred hereafter, that he had out of <hi>Prato</hi> &amp; the precincts thereof, a thousand Duckets <hi>communibm annis</hi> for
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:9711:19"/>
the flesh there eaten, at the rate of fiue <hi>denari</hi> the pound, for so much he hath. Now if we reduce Duckets to <hi>denari</hi> (which are the fourth part of a <hi>Quattrino</hi>) &amp; deuide that number by fiue, we shall finde the number of pounds of flesh eaten there, after the rate of twelue ounces to the pounds (for so is their weight of all things whatsoeuer) which summe by the rule of three we may reduce to pounds English of sixteene ounces, and then deuiding by fourteene, know how many Stone is there eaten in a yeare. According to which computation we shall finde 18000 Stone: the people there being, as is already said 16000 persons, so that there is little more then a Stone a peece for the yeare: a proportion which in Newgate market, and S. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas</hi>-shambles will hardly be beleeued.</p>

And as we measure our land by the Acre, so they theirs by the <hi>Staioro,</hi> which taketh his name of the <hi>Staio:</hi> because one of these parcels of land, if it be on the hilles, will aske a <hi>Staio</hi> of corne to feed it, otherwise in the valleys euery measure will ordinarily feed foure <hi>Straiora,</hi> I suppose that six of these make one of our Acres. The country-man will stirre of them (as we call it) eighteene with his two yoake of Oxen; the one yoake feeding while the other laboureth in one day. He hath for his labour foure <hi>Crazie</hi> a peece, which is three-pence starling; so that he and his beasts earne some foure shillings six-pence ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the day: how this agreeth with our rate in <hi>England,</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not say, I went not out so good a husband.

vp the dung in the streetes, and carrying it to the land of those with whom they haue bargained, paying out of euery Asses burthen one <hi>quattrino</hi> to the Duke before they passe the gates, but this is a discourse for another place.</p>
            <p>It remaineth to speake of the Salt,<note place="margin">Salt.</note> another co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie which they haue here in <hi>Tuscany</hi> in some reasonable manner. It is very white and good, much better then that of the Churches Salt, which hath almost the colour of Saw-dust, or that of <hi>Liguria</hi> which is little better. The two places from whence they haue this commoditie, is the Citty of <hi>Grossetta</hi> in the <hi>Maremma,</hi> and the pits not far from the Citty of <hi>Volterra:</hi> howbeit they make of it at these pits in greater measure; where it is reported are daily made throughout the yeare twenty foure <hi>Moggie,</hi> euery of these measures being foure and twenty <hi>Staia,</hi> that is of our measure some sixteene Strike a peece: so that there are dayly made 48. quarters. They know when it is sufficiently boiled by the throwing in of an Egge, for if it sinck, then is it not yet perfect,<note place="margin">Sulphurius waters ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</note> but if it swimmeth (<hi>a galla</hi>) then they boile it no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. There are not farre hence (may I digresse so farre) waters of such a scalding and sulphurious nature, as if a Dog or such like creature be tied to a rope and throwne therein for the space of a quarter of an houre, yee pull out nothing but the bare bones. And true it is, that the aire here abouts sometimes of the yeare is so contagious, as the inhabitants abandon their homes. The place being so dangerous, I will dwell no longer vpon the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course thereof, but returne to the Salt-pits, out of which the great Duke maketh no small benefit, considering he buyeth it at one <hi>quattrini</hi> the pound, and selleth it againe at twelue, and in some parts of his State at fifteene, which being bought at this rate commeth to two Duckets the <hi>Staio:</hi> Howbeit, it is said of some, that it costeth him fiue <hi>quattrini</hi> the pound, which I rather beleeue, and so his gaine is but two third parts.

               <note place="margin">His stile.</note> Concerning his Stile, it is to be obserued, that since the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment came to the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of this familie, it hath altered foure times: for first, when by <hi>Clement</hi> the 7. his meanes, who was a <hi>Medici, Alexandro</hi> had obtained the signory of <hi>Florence,</hi> he was entituled Prior perpetuall: after that matching in the house of <hi>Austria,</hi> he was created Duke of <hi>Florence.</hi> The title yet chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged twice more in the person of <hi>Cosmo,</hi> father to this great duke now liuing, for hauing vnited the States of <hi>Florence</hi> and <hi>Siena,</hi> he was entituled, <hi>Dux Florentiae et Senarum:</hi> And after by <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> he was created <hi>Magnus Dux Hetruriae</hi> for some speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all seruice done to the Church.</p>
            <p>This title of Duke is not of any great antiquitie in <hi>Italy</hi>; for although <hi>Titus Liuius</hi> speaketh of <hi>Duces,</hi> yet he meaneth Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of Souldiers, or rather such as had the leading of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie by the Senates appointment, and not such as haue absolute authoritie ouer Citties and Countries. The first bringer in of this name into <hi>Italy,</hi> was <hi>Longinus</hi> King of the <hi>Lombardes,</hi> one hundred sixtie sixe yeares after the declination of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine</hi> Empire. By him at the first were created foure, which bore their title of these places; <hi>Beneuentum, Turine, Fruily,</hi> and <hi>Spoleto</hi>: At which time also were instituted the two Marque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarts of <hi>Ancona</hi> and <hi>Treuiso,</hi> which still liue in the names, though dead in the persons that should haue them: and it should seeme in some sort, this title of Marquesse was better then that of Duke. For in their language (saith <hi>Biondo</hi>) it signifieth <hi>Perpetuum Magistratum,</hi> because they might leaue their title and Signorie to their heires, which the Dukes could not doe, but by the leaues of the Kings of <hi>Lombardie.</hi> Some say this word of <hi>Marques</hi> is deriued from the <hi>French (Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que)</hi> which signifieth a Prouince; as that a <hi>Marques</hi> should signifie the President of a Prouince. Others thinke it is deriued of the Dutch word (<hi>Marchk</hi>) among whom this title is in great honor, &amp; signifieth a <hi>Signor</hi> ouer a Country to some limit or marke, for so <hi>Altimeri</hi> in his <hi>Scholia</hi> vpon <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> interpreteth. As for this title of great Duke, there neuer was any before in <hi>Italy,</hi> nor I thinke in <hi>Europe,</hi> but he of <hi>Musconia:</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:9711:23"/>
Of Dukes there be diuers in this Countrie of <hi>Italy,</hi> as the Dukes of <hi>Ferrara, Muntoua, Parma, Vrbino</hi>; besides foure and twenty in the kingdome of <hi>Naples.</hi>

            <p>Concerning his claime and right to the Crowne,<note place="margin">His title.</note> it is beyond the compasse of a bare relation, (as this is) to dispute how good it is but rather to discourse what it is, neither to determine how iustly his Predecessors got it, but how lineally it is deuolued from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to him.

            <p>The order of this discourse requireth that in this place I brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aduertise of the order of <hi>San Stephano,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His order of S. Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen.</note> whereof his highnesse is grand-master, which was first instituted by <hi>Cosmo</hi> his father, and confirmed by <hi>Pius Quintus.</hi> But because the ordinances &amp; statutes therof be very many, aswell concerning the inuestiture as degradation, &amp; for that there is a booke written thereof inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled <hi>della Religione di san Stephano:</hi> I will only remember that the <hi>Gran Maestro</hi> conferreth diuers other offices belonging to this order, and of chiefe accoumpt, vpon persons of principall qualitie in his state: as the office of <hi>Gran Comandator, Gran Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testabile,</hi> and <hi>Gran Priore.</hi> There be three degrees of this order; the first is of <hi>Cauallieri querrieri,</hi> the second are <hi>Ecclesiastichi</hi>; the last <hi>Seruienti.</hi> Of the first sort haue beene made (as in their Pallace at <hi>Pisa</hi> appeareth) about one thousand and twenty. The second are Priests &amp; persons of the church, not so honourable as the former. The last are such as haue baser offices either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Pallace, or about their lands, and receiue annuall wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges for their paines. The <hi>Cognisance</hi> or badge of this order, is a crosse, in forme like that of the knights of <hi>Malta,</hi> but differing in colour, for that of <hi>Malta</hi> is white, this is red. They are bound to weare it alwayes vpon their vpper garment, which the great duke himselfe also obserueth. They are bound also to serue at Sea in the <hi>Grand</hi> Maisters warres for six yeares (as I take it) if need be whereas they of <hi>Malta</hi> are bound to serue against the Turke all the dayes of their life. The Knights of this order may marry, and hold temporall possessions, which they of <hi>Malta</hi> may not. This order is lineally to discend from the father to the eldest sonne, without any more creation, like the Titles of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours in <hi>England,</hi> vnlesse his father vpon demerit be formerly degraded. What other priuiledges they haue, in the booke ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> appeareth, &amp; what vse the <hi>Grand-master</hi> hath of their seruice in all his occasions, is as easily coniectured.</p>

Besides if one should vndertake to write of euery thing he hath seene, &amp; giue it the <hi>Italians</hi> valuation (who in matters of their owne, euer speake <hi>alla larga</hi>) I assure my selfe he should be very much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, and gaine the imputation of a notable Gull for his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity, &amp; a notorious Bugiarde for his deliuery, against which, note his farre trauaile neither giues him warrant nor <hi>supersedeas.</hi> I was in a <hi>Florentines</hi> gallery, who hath sometimes beene in our Countrey, where besides one table of Tutch, and three other of Serpentine, Agate, and such like, very curiously wrought and bordered with flowers of their naturall colours (which might be painted for ought I knew): howbeit he protested they were all the naturall colours of the stone, and of the infinite charge it cost to cut so many, before they could finde such as should giue the true lustre of the flower, which surely is there done most liuely: and besides many Statues of Marble, Alabaster &amp; Brasse, he shewed vs a Cupbord of Boxes yet vnfinished (which he said) hath already cost foure and twenty thousand crownes: we see also diuers Medalles, at the least fiue hundred, which he valued some at twenty and thirty crownes the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now if one had swallowed this Gudgion of one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twentie thousand Crownes (for so much he said these toyes in this Gallery did cost) he must needs either haue sur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But to returne to the great Dukes riches; in the Gallery at <hi>Florence</hi> where is his <hi>Guarda-roba</hi> his Wardrope, and Armory, there is very much and massie Plate, with one Cupbord of pure gold, the value I cannot estimate. There is also one Table in making for the Emperour, which hath already cost (they say)
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:9711:26"/>
twenty two thousand duckets set with very many &amp; very faire Stones. There is one Deske worth (as they dare affirme) one Million. There are likewise <hi>Rapiers</hi> with hilts of gould, and in their Pomels either the Spheres or Clockes very curiously wrought. There be swords so artificially made, that they may be throwne out the length of three, and being at the full length, it dischargeth a Pistoll: there is the Sword of <hi>Charlemaine</hi> greatly prized. There be Targets which with a Pinne turned make Daggers flie out of all sides. There are besides the diuers weapons of most Nations, with many other things for the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and rarenesse worth the remembring, as also the great Dukes chaine of Diamonds, and the great Duchesses chaine of Pearle which they weare dayly, two iewels no doubt of excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding value: besides all other their iewels &amp; treasures not seene. But the thing which most argueth his Riches, and whereof he and other Princes haue their daily vses, and whereby they be valued, is ready Money and Coine; which the world (and no doubt vpon good reason) iudgeth to be very great: insomuch as the <hi>Neopolitan</hi> calleth him the King of coine: for in their play at <hi>Primero</hi> (their foure sutes of cardes being <hi>denari, Coppe, Spade, Picche, Coyne, Cuppes, Swords, Pikes</hi>) when (as the manner is) yee aske him for what Carde he pulleth, if he pull for a <hi>Denaro</hi> he answereth; I pull for the great Duke of <hi>Tuscany.</hi> And truely I am of opinion (submitting my selfe to better iudgments) that as in <hi>France</hi> there be foure great Riuers farre excelling the rest of that countrey in generall, and yet one another in some one particular: <hi>Loyre</hi> the greatest, <hi>Rhone</hi> the swiftest, <hi>Sayne</hi> the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chest, and <hi>Sone</hi> the sweetest. So in <hi>Italy</hi> there are foure great States, aboue all the other without exception, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing in some one particular compared together, exceed one another. The Pope greatest in authoritie, the kingdome of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> greatest in land-forces; the <hi>Venetians</hi> mightiest at Sea; and this great Duke mightiest in purse. Of whose present money some let not to say that he hath thirty millions of Duckets, others talke of fiue and twenty, none vnder twenty; but how truely, must be left to euery mans pleasure to iudge, as a thing vtterly vnknowne, except we may guide our coniectures by
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:9711:27"/>
this inference, which may thus be collected.</p>
            <p>Duke <hi>Francesco</hi> in the yeare 1576. reported to the <hi>Venetian</hi> Embassador, that his father <hi>Cosmo</hi> dying, left him in debt eight hundred thousand Duckets: for the paiment whereof he was forced to take vp great summes of the <hi>Genoeses,</hi> at vnreasonable interest. Notwithstanding it appeareth by the relation of the said Embassador, that within ten yeares after he was cleared of that debt, and had imbursed to his coffers fiue Millions. It may then be probably argued, that if in ten yeares there were six millions encrease, in twenty years more, there be at least twelue more added. But if it be obiected that Duke <hi>Francesco</hi> in the terme of those ten yeares had many hundred thousand duckets confiscate to his coffers by the treason of <hi>Pucci,</hi> who with his complices had plotted to enuite the Duke, the Cardinall, and <hi>Don Piero</hi> to a feast, and there to murder them all, and so to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer their liberty; It may hereto be answered that he was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise a Prince of very great expences, and that for instance in that very time, he built the Pallace and water-workes of <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolino,</hi> which cost him at the least three hundred thousand duc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets. As for this great Duke now liuing, his expences are small for so great a Prince, as by the small number of them which liue in Court may appeare. And yet euery <hi>Carneuale</hi> time he reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth himselfe from <hi>Florence,</hi> where is much to be spent, to <hi>Pisa</hi> where is somewhat to be gained: he saith he doth it for the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection he beareth that towne; his people say, for the loue he hath to spare; our English Marchants there say, it is for loue of their commodities, which about that time arriue, and are brought vp by his officers.</p>
            <p>It is likewise knowne he hath great summes of money in banck, which must needs bring in their yearely gaine, besides three-score thousa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d duckets entrate, which he yearly detaineth from his brother <hi>Don Piere,</hi> who liueth in <hi>Spaine,</hi> &amp; the gaine of Wheate before remembred; all which with his yearly reuenue may make one strongly perswaded, that his ready money is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle lesse then that which is iudged of them which rate it at the highest. I should surely thinke it an incredible masse, but that I haue read for certaine, that in the yeare 1592, the ready money
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:9711:27"/>
of <hi>Amurath,</hi> father to <hi>Mahomet</hi> the third, the great <hi>Turke</hi> now liuing, was at the least fifty millions. And although the dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of their Entrates may seeme much to weaken the force of this comparison: yet I see not, considering on the other side as great difference in their expenses, but that it may carry some good shew of likelyhood. To conclude this point, it appeareth, that the great Duke hath two Reuenues whereby he groweth rich; that is, great impositions, and great sparing (for sparing is a great reuenue.) There yet remaineth two other meanes to make him absolutely rich, the loue of his subiects, and their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate wealth (for the wealth of the Subiect is the wealth of the king, and where the people is rich, the Prince is not poore. But sure it is that he hath neither the one, nor they the other.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">His forces.</note> It is to be thought that he which hath money such store wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth no forces (for money is called the sinews of warre) I will therefore to this short discourse of his Riches, adde in a word what is thought of his forces. His strength at Sea is not great, for he hath not aboue six Galleys, neither hath had since the ouerthrowe that the Turkes gaue him at the little Ilands <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miche,</hi> where he lost two of his best Galleys and one Galleon. In these that remaine he hath besides Munition ordinary, (that is eight or ten a peece,) about two hundred Souldiers and eight hundred slaues.

touch, as in a place as necessary, fit, and secure, as are the <hi>Terse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res</hi> to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> failing to the West-Indies: so that if he with this Isle had also a good number of Galleis and a purpose to offend, he might very easily infest all the Seas vpon the coast of <hi>Barbary,</hi> vpon <hi>Pronence, Lyguria, Tuscania,</hi> and all that side of <hi>Italie,</hi> and in a manner make himselfe Lord of those Mid-land Seas. He hath also (as is reported) one hundred Soldiers, &amp; good Artillerie in a Fort he holdeth at <hi>Marseilles</hi> called <hi>Castle dite</hi>; by the sufferance of which peece the <hi>Genoeses</hi> ship was in <hi>Ianuary</hi> last taken, (wherof the parties grieued complained lately to the great Duke) where besides foure hundred <hi>Spaniards</hi> put to the Gallies, was also found foure hundred thousand crownes, sent thether from <hi>Spaine.</hi> He hath also in those thirty Castles and Fortes before spoken of (wherein are garrisons but very small, as in some fiftie, and in others fiue and twentie, in others not aboue fifteene &amp; in some fewer by reason of the good tearmes he standeth in with his neighbours Princes, or at least by the good fauour of the time, for that they be otherwise diuerted, that would be busie, to the number of six hundred in all. He hath likewise in all his sixteene Citties, garrisons of Souldiers more or lesse, as in the Cyttadell <hi>S. Miniato,</hi> and the new For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresse at <hi>Florence</hi> one hundred &amp; twenty, in <hi>Pisa</hi> fiftie, in <hi>Siena</hi> twentie fiue, in <hi>Liuorno</hi> two hundred and twenty, &amp;c. In all which places he is said to be very well prouided of Munition, Armour, weapons, Powder, shott, and such like military proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; the certaine quantity wherof I cannot certainly enforme, because, but vpon especiall fauour, and by commandement, they dare not let one come into their Fortes. And to write what others say, were to erre himselfe and seduce others. I was by good meanes in the Castle at <hi>Liuorno,</hi> where I told of field pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces three-score and foure, whereof (they told me) that twelue were canon, and demi-canon; by which proportion it is to be coniectured that he is very well furnished.</p>
            <p>These Souldiers of whom is already spoken, are all in pay; he hath also a <hi>Rassegna,</hi> his trained Souldier (as we in <hi>England</hi> call them) about the number whereof there is great difference, between that which is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by way of relation, &amp; that which
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:9711:28"/>
is by way of conference reported. Relations (the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which nothing is more false) write that there be thirty six thousand: but I talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a Captaine, who hath the mustering &amp; charge of three hundred within the precincts of <hi>Prato</hi> (then whom no man should know better) and he tolde me but of fifteene thousand. In this diuersitie of report I haue no other guide to direct me, to whether of these I should giue credit, then by a rateable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the part with the whole, to inferre whether of these two commeth nearer to the trueth, in this manner. It is now certainly holden, that the number of people in the States of <hi>Florence</hi> and <hi>Siena</hi> vnited together, are about eight hundred thousand, and that they which recken six in the one &amp; fiue in the other, and so make one million and one hundred thousand, do somewhat ouershoot the true number, much more they that recken 800000. in the state of <hi>Florence,</hi> and 600000. in that of <hi>Siena,</hi> not considering that the people of <hi>Siena</hi> and <hi>Pisa</hi> with their precincts are much decayed, as hath already beene partly said. Now then if sixteene thousand people (the number of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> within the <hi>distretto</hi> (the precincts) of <hi>Prato</hi>) do allow the great Duke a <hi>Rassegna</hi> of three hundred, which I haue seene foure times trained (for they muster and are exercised once a month throughout his state) then eight hundred thousand will allow fifteene thousand after that rate. But if it be answered that vpon the frontiers of the church and in the <hi>Maremma,</hi> there is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Rassegna</hi> then in other places, and so the proportion not to hold, I reply, to answer this with sufficient recompence, there is no mustering of Souldiers nor any <hi>Rassegna</hi> in the cittie of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> which is a good part of the whole. So that of this I am sure, that in <hi>Florence, Prato, Pistoia, Pisa,</hi> &amp; their territories, there are not in all aboue two thousand two hundred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I should ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thinke it strange and very disproportionate, that there should be aboue twenty thousand in all. It may be demanded why they of <hi>Florence</hi> are not trained aswell as the rest; the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is, <hi>manet alta mente reposta tyrannis Papae, &amp; consensus Impera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toris,</hi> Pope <hi>Clements</hi> vsurping, and <hi>Charles</hi> the fifts consent, sticks still in their stomacks. For they haue not yet forgot that their fathers were free &amp; commanders ouer others) &amp; therfore
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:9711:29"/>
they are not onely preuented of this meanes which peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture at sometime or other they might take, but they be also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred the hauing of any Armes in their houses, or of wearing any weapon by their sides, except he be a knight of the order, or a trained Souldier, or an officer, or one that hath especiall li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence for the same, whereof there be many Gentlemen in <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> according to the fauour they haue with the Prince, and as he is secured of them. The like is through the whole state, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch as many will sue to be trained Souldiers (a thing which with vs they would gladly auoide) because they might be pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledged to weare weapon, but especially (which is also a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome granted to men of this profession) because they might not be arrested for debt.</p>
            <p>His forces at Sea and land are these already remembred, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side one hundred Launces which he keepeth in <hi>Siena,</hi> &amp; some fiftie light horse in his owne stables at <hi>Florence,</hi> besides foure hundred more in other places of his state.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Entrate,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His entrate</note> is by diuerse men diuersly estimated, some say one Million and a halfe, others one Million and a hundred thousand, and some there be that say it is as much as both these summes. Howsoeuer it may be thought that the least of these is a great matter for so small a State, whether we call it small in regarde of the circuite, the number of the People; or lastly the barrennesse of the soile, out of which the Subiects wealth and Princes Taxes should be raised. This may well be proued by comparing this state with that of the Duke of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> which is not much lesse in continent then this of the great Duke, and the soile generally much more fruitful, yet is the reuenue of this great Duke almost thrice as much as that other. An apparant argument of the ouer-charging of his people by Taxations &amp; impositions more then their neighbours: yet are the subiects of the state of <hi>Venice</hi> lesse charged then these, &amp; they vnder the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> least of all; onely they of the kingdome of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> haue as much cause to complaine as the <hi>Tuscanes,</hi> or any other subiects in <hi>Italy</hi> whatsoeuer. As for the trueth of those three opinions, which of them hath best interest therein I dare not determine; I will onely adde to these generallities such
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:9711:29"/>
particulars as are commonly knowne, &amp; of all confessed, with some other specialties which are of most men either purposely (because vncertaine) omitted, or else negligently related.</p>
            <p>The opinion of them that rate his Reuenue at 1100. thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Duckets is directed by this particular:

               </gap>hall appeare not to swarue much, if we exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine each particular. First for the Toll of the gates of <hi>Florence</hi> and custome out of the <hi>Dogana,</hi> it is apparently knowne that the great Duke lets it out at two hundred thousand Duckets the yeare at the least, reckoning withall of all other impositions one fourth part of that whole State, which is probably suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be gathered hereout. There is paid also throughout the whole state, eight <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n the hundred for marriages, as if the woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s portion be a thousa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d duckets, the Prince hath thereout eighty. The like proportion is paid for buying &amp; selling of houses or land. But the letting of houses or land payeth the tenth: for Cattell bought and sold, he hath also a <hi>guiglio,</hi> that is six-pence Sterling in euery two Duckets, and though the Beasts be
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:9711:30"/>
bought and sold twice in one houre, he hath still after the same rate. Furthermore, besides his impositions vpon the Bancks, he hath at euery alienation eight in the hundred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is, when the father or possessor dieth, the sonne or next heires payeth after this rate for his patrimony left him. He hath also an entrate out of the <hi>Burdello</hi> stewes,<note place="margin">Burdello.</note> which is thought at the least thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand crownes a yeare in <hi>Florence</hi> onely there being some eight thousand Curtizans in the towne, these pay euery moneth a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer nine-pence sterling to the great Duke, because heere the market is somewhat quick, though in <hi>Siena</hi> they pay but a <hi>gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio</hi> monthly, they pay also a <hi>Liuer</hi> a moneth not to weare the yellow list the badge of their trade, if they stand out of the <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dello,</hi> if they be priuiledged to go to any mans lodging, or if they weare mans apparell, for each of these priuiledges they pay <hi>Gabell</hi> also. The Iewes here also from fifteene yeares vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, pay two Duckets the yeare.</p>
            <p>Concerning the <hi>Gabell</hi> vpon bread,<note place="margin">Bread.</note> true it is, that he hath vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on euery Stay that is ground two <hi>Crazie,</hi> three halfe-pence of ours, so that by this rate he hath of euery quarter of our mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, the summe of eighteene-pence of our money. If then it be supposed that euery one in the state of <hi>Florence</hi> eate twelue <hi>Staia</hi> a yeare, which is as before a proportion ordinary, the summe will not much differ from the rate of one hundred and twenty thousand Duckets.</p>
            <p>Concerning the flesh,<note place="margin">Flesh.</note> it is to be vnderstood, that the great duke hath for euery pound that is eaten fiue <hi>denari,</hi> whereof 20. make a <hi>Crazia,</hi> so that he hath of euery Stone that is eaten of our weight, the value of three-pence of our money.</p>
            <p>He hath vpon euery pound of Salt spent, ten <hi>quattrini</hi> gaine, that is three halfe-pence of our money: so that after the rate of foure and twenty <hi>Moggia</hi> the day, for three hundred dayes in a yeare, allowing the other sixtie fiue for holly-dayes, he gaines two hundred and sixteene thousand, seauen hundred sixtie one Duckets, whereof allowing almost one halfe for the state of <hi>Siena,</hi> because there he hath no imposition vpon Salt, the sum will accord very neerely with the particular abouesaid.</p>

            <p>But ouer and besides all this, it is to be considered,<note place="margin">Gabel by Pole.</note> that in the whole state of <hi>Siena</hi> he hath a <hi>Gabell</hi> by the Pole as we call it in <hi>England,</hi> that is vpon euery head a certaine rate, (I thinke eighteene-pence) besides an allowance for feeding of their cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, whereof in this State is reasonable good store, much more then in that of <hi>Florence,</hi> whose wants it supplyeth, especially of Swine, by reason of their grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Insomuch as talking with two Gentlemen of <hi>Siena</hi> concerning these matters, men of good qualitie and experience, they auowed that the great Duke had as good as a Ducket vpon euery masted Swine before he come to the owners table. They farther alleaged, that howsoeuer they were exempt from the <hi>Gabell</hi> of the <hi>Macina</hi> as they call it, that is of paying for their Meale, Salt, and Flesh, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all things considered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their burthen was no whit ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then their neighbours of the other State, that paid all these.

At euery three yeares end, all the Inne-keepers in the Cittie are to appeare at a Court in the <hi>Dogana</hi> kept for that purpose.

There is a Candle set vp light and while that lasteth, it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to lone and bid for the same, and he that biddeth most shall haue it. Wherein this one thing may seeme more strange, then that which hath beene already enformed concerning a mans Corne, that in some cases he cannot make his prouision of his owne; for here if another will giue more for the Inne then I, though the house be mine owne, he shall haue it, paying me onely my rent, and I shall be forced to seeke another.

least:<pb n="53" facs="tcp:9711:32"/>
which now goeth not to the common treasure, as in times past, but to the great dukes coffers: the like is to be said of all other places in this Dukedome.</p>
            <p>But it is to be obserued, that before this money which resul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of the <hi>Communità</hi> be carryed to <hi>Florence</hi> to the dukes Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer,<note place="margin">Monte di Pieta.</note> it is put into the <hi>Monte di Pietà</hi> the Bancke of Pitty: a place where any poore man may pawne his houshold stuffe, or cloathes, or whatsoeuer els is worth money (prouided al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the gage be worth more then the money) he taketh this money he hath for a day and a yeare after fiue in the hundred. And if at the time he returne not to redeeme the thing enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, it is sold by Trumpet, for what can be gotten where-out the principall and interest being taken, the poore man shall haue the rest. So that the great Duke hauing this ouerplus, for now it is their Prouerbe, <hi>Il'Duca è la Communità</hi> in euery Citty and great towne, and the vse besides for the money, which will amount to a round summe through the whole State (for there be of these Banckes in euery place) it is to be coniectured, that his whole <hi>Entrate</hi> is a greater matter then it is ordinarily taken for, of them who esteeme it at one Million and one hundred thousand Duckets, I should rather condiscend to them, that rate it at one Million and a halfe.</p>
            <p>Concerning his expenses it is harder to guesse at,<note place="margin">His expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> then his <hi>Entrate</hi> those of the Duke <hi>Francesco</hi> were supposed about fiue hundred thousand Duckets; these of this Duke they say be much lesser.

in a generallity, then being too particuler to erre.</p>
            <p>As for his expence vpon his troope of horse,<note place="margin">His expe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce on horse.</note> the Lance hath 7. <hi>Piastras</hi> (1. fiue shillings 3. pence a peece) a moneth, the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horseman hath three now in the time of peace, in warres a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter proportion. The Souldier in all his garrisons hath foure <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astras</hi> a moneth, the officers proportionate, each in his place to this rate. As for the trained Souldier, he is (in peace) no charge to the Duke for he findeth himselfe shot, powder, armour, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, and all things necessary, and is bound to keepe them in good order; the Captaines and officers of these are paid out of the <hi>Communità</hi> as hath beene abouesaid. The charge of his Galleys allowing (as <hi>Don Antonio Doria</hi> in his discourse how to resist the Turke at Sea doth proportion, that is,) each moneth fiue hundred gold crownes a Galley, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth in the halfe yeare which time they be commonly at Sea, to the sum of eighteene thousand gold crownes. The charge of his Court, as by the number of persons therein aboue enformed, may be collected, cannot be great. I haue heard one of his seruants say, that the Steward is allowed for <hi>Spezierie,</hi> Spicery, fifteene thousand duckets, &amp; that all other charges may treble so much more. As for all officers of Court, but these few before remembred, they feede at their owne tables; His Pages (which are Gentlemens sonnes of the Citty, or other places) in number as I take it six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene, are at his charges kept at Schoole &amp; at dyet in the Citty: His <hi>Staffieri</hi> or Footemen are allowed six <hi>Piastras</hi> the moneth, they are about thirty. His guarde of <hi>Swisses</hi> haue foure <hi>Piastras</hi> the moneth; both these and they feed at their owne charge, or soiorne at some place, for they haue no allowance out of the dukes kitchin, not so much but the Cookes as I haue heard, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing done their office, go to their owne houses to meat. A buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this duke is not at <hi>Liuorno,</hi> where indeed is very great cost bestowed, &amp; very many daily working: howbeit considering the labour of his Galley-slaues, which all the winter are there imploied, and of many poore men in the country which vpon light faults are thither confined, whose labour he hath paying nothing, it may appeare the charge is not halfe so much as it
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:9711:33"/>
would cost another. There are also to be considered these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penses, which they call <hi>spese segrete,</hi> secret charges, &amp; no doubt are very great, for that this Prince maketh his way to many ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of much importance by money; as namly in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> where although the Pope that now is was chose<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> without the good wil, or rather quite against the desire of this Prince, &amp; although the family <hi>Aldobrandini</hi> was alwaies an empeacher of the <hi>Medicies</hi> greatnesse, and though likewise the father of this Prince executed the father of this Pope; and albeit lastly this Pope desireth nothing more, then that by his meanes his natiue countrey might recouer her former liberty yet notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding so strong is this Princes faction in that Colledge, and so many his friends by meanes of his money, as he resteth secured from any such danger. The like intelligence it is said he hath in the <hi>Spanish</hi> court by presents and pensions to the <hi>Infanta,</hi> &amp; others of the Counsaile, so as by his money he is able to diuert what purposes soeuer. He hath also at his maintenance secret espials in <hi>Florence</hi> for his better securitie, as not yet forgetting the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of <hi>Pucci</hi> in his brothers dayes.</p>

            <p>An instance of this we had this Ianuary last past,<note place="margin">The dukes kinde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the English.</note> which I the rather remember to make knowne, what care his highnesse hath to giue our countrey good satisfaction, of whom all Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Gentlemen receiue very gracious fauours, as to be admitted to the presence at any <hi>Veglia,</hi> Reuells, or other time of extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary sight, also to haue the priuiledge to weare Armes, and other such like. An <hi>English</hi> Gent'eman was by a base groome of the house where he lodged, throwne into the <hi>Arno,</hi> for the money he was supposed to haue in his lodging; the offender, vpon suspition being apprehended, and receiuing the <hi>Strappa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi> diuers times, and in the highest degree, notwithstanding per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted obstinately in the deniall. The lawe is there that except he confesse the fact he cannot be executed, how pregnant so euer the presumption be against him; insomuch it was thought he should haue beene discharged: wherevpon the court sent to his Highnesse for direction; he returned them order to vse all manner of torments which possible, or in any cases that court could inflict, and if yet he would not confesse to torture him till he dyed. According to this commission they gaue him the <hi>Sueglia,</hi> a kinde of torture, where hauing receiued a drinke to procure sleepe, the Tortures euer when he noddeth whip him with small plummets, he sitteth bare vpon an Yron like the back of a knife and hott Brickes vnder his feete to burne him, if he would ease himselfe that way. It is reported he endured this also, till they came to giue him <hi>L'Arco</hi> the Bowe, at which he confessed. This done he is carried before the court, there freely to say, whether he confessed for feare of torment, or that it is the very truth he said: if he auowe it, they proceed to iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:9711:35"/>
if otherwise, he is returned to the torture; for this is the onely way to proceed as is before said, how apparent soeuer the matter be, vnlesse it be proued by two witnesses. As for wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, it is there hard to be had, being holden a dishonourable thing to be a witnesse, or an enformer, a <hi>Spia,</hi> as they terme it. Insomuch as if an offence be committed in the streetes in the view of diuers Gentlemen, though they were not of the action, no nor of the company, notwithstanding they shall haue the <hi>Strappado</hi> to confesse the matter, which rather then doe, they will suffer. So that to haue the <hi>Strappado,</hi> in <hi>Florence</hi> is no dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, except the cause make it so. But to returne to this matter, which I haue of purpose reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred, to make it appeare how these courts euen in small matters receiue directions from the Prince. After this fellow had auouched to the Court that he did the fact, they sent againe to his Highnesse to know how they should proceed. He returned, that the malefactor should loose his right hand at the doore where was the Gentlemans lodging, and from thence to be drawne to the place of Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, there to be hanged and quartered, which was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly performed.</p>
