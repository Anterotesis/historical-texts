            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head type="sub">The True Engliſh-man ſpeaking plain Engliſh, in a Letter from a Friend to a Friend.</head>
            <p>I thank you for the Character of a Popiſh Succeſſor which you ſent me, wherein our Juſt fears, and the grounds of them, are juſtly ſet out. But I am in greater fear of the preſent Poſſeſſor, why do we frighten our ſelves about the Evil that is to come, not looking to that which is at hand? We would cut off the Budding Weeds, and let the Poyſonous Root lye ſtill; we would ſtop the Channel of our Evils, and let the Fountain ſtill run: My meaning is this, can <hi>Pylades</hi> Know and Act all theſe Bloody Conſpiracies, and not impart them to his dear <hi>Oreſtes?</hi> if <hi>James</hi> be Conſcious and Guilty, <hi>Charles</hi> is ſo too: Believe me, theſe two Brethren in Iniquity, they are in Confederacy with <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>French</hi> to introduce Popery and Arbitrary Government, as all their Actions demonſtrate: the Parliament, <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and Liberty of the Subject are as heavy Yoaks which they would caſt off to be as abſolute as their Br. of <hi>France;</hi> and if this can be proved to be their only aim and endeavor, why ſhould not every True Britain be a <hi>Quaker</hi> thus far? Let the <hi>Engliſh</hi> riſe, and move as one Man to ſelf defence, to open Action, and fling off their intollerable Riders. Blow the the Trumpet, ſtand on your Guard, and withſtand them as Bears and Tygers, And ſince there can be no truſt given to this goodly couple of Popiſh Brethren, nor no relief expected from a Parliament; Truſt to your Swords in defence of your Lives, Laws, Religion and Properties, like the ſtout Earl of Old, who told a King that if he could not be defended by <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> he would be relieved by <hi>Longa Spada.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet to convince the World that this <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Race is Corrupt Root and Branch, and Popiſh from the very beginning, be pleas'd to conſider theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons following.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:38040:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The Grand-father of theſe Men, <hi>James</hi> the <hi>Scot,</hi> was of no Religion at the bottom, but entred by a pretence of a Sham-plot of the Papiſts againſt his Life, whilſt really he collogued with the Popiſh Party under hand; h<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, his Kindred with great Submiſſion, yet afterwards thinking it for h<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to Cajole the Parliament, and write againſt the Pope and Cardinals, he ſends a <hi>Scots</hi> Bird to blind the Eyes of the <hi>Vatican</hi> Keeper with Money, and to ſteal his Letters from off the Roman File, and then he crowes as boldly as an unſuſpected Harlot for the Proteſtant Religion and Intereſt.</p>
            <p>That Man's Son <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, held a Secret Correſpondency with the Pope, calling him his Dear and Holy Father, as is to be ſeen in his Letters recorded in <hi>Ruſhworth</hi>'s Collections: Were not his Wife and Courtiers Papiſts? Did he not countenance and promote the Rebellion in <hi>Ireland?</hi> As the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Grandees and his very Commiſſions teſtifie and declare, was there not a Popiſh Plot, and an Univerſal Conſpiracy of the Papiſts diſcovered to him and his Confeſſor <hi>Laud,</hi> and did they not piouſly ſtifle it leſt they ſhould have diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the Nakedneſs of their Mother Church? Whilſt that goodly Proteſtant Prince pretended to relieve the poor beſieged Proteſtants at <hi>Roſhel</hi> by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident <hi>Buckingham,</hi> did he not hold Correſpondency with the <hi>French</hi> Cardinal how to betray them for a Summ of Money (which his obſtinacy with his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament made him ſtand in need of.) But they who ſo ill approved themſelves to be Heads of the Proteſtant Church, <hi>Charles</hi> and <hi>Laud,</hi> did they not looſe their own Heads by a manifeſt Judgment of God? And was not the falſe heart of their Emiſſary <hi>Buckingham,</hi> found out by an Aſſaſſins Knife?</p>
            <p>But to come nearer to our purpoſe, theſe two goodly Imps of our days are ſtark naught; arrived at the heigth of Wickedneſs, and of profeſſed Arbitrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Popery.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>James,</hi> he was a Papiſt whilſt he had a Regiment in the <hi>French,</hi> and afterwards in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Service beyond Seas. And as for <hi>Charles,</hi> he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, e're he came into <hi>England,</hi> to have been reconciled to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in one of the <hi>French</hi> Kings Country Houſes; and ſince they came in, how have they wheedled and played faſt and looſe, in their profeſſion of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion as occaſion and their Affairs requir'd? Have they not all along maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Secret Correſpondency with <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Rome?</hi> As <hi>Colemans</hi> Letters may ſufficiently inſtruct ſuch who have not ſeen more Secret Memories.</p>
            <p>But let us come to Examine their Actions which are a better proof of their hearts, were not the Dukes Servants and Confidents all Papiſts? Witneſs his Talbots, Patricks and other <hi>Iriſh</hi> Teags, were not the Duke and ſuch of his Creatures as were known Papiſts promoted to all publick Offices of truſt both at Sea and Land? Witneſs <hi>Bellaſis</hi> now a Traytor in the <hi>Tower,</hi> did not <hi>James</hi> by <hi>Coleman, Throgmorton</hi> and others, hold open Correſpondency with the Pope and Cardinals? and could <hi>Charles</hi> be Ignorant of all this? Nay he lik'd all ſo well, that he hardly employed any about him but Papiſts, as <hi>Clifford</hi> whom he made Treaſurer; or employed any abroad but Perſons of the ſame ſtamp, Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>Godolphin</hi> whom he ſent Embaſſador into <hi>Spain,</hi> as he did others elſewhere, what more obvious than that though the Duke's Treachery againſt the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Proteſtant Religion be fully made out, and the People and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeek to bring him to a Legal Tryal, yet <hi>Charles</hi> obſtructs Juſtice, and will not ſuffer it? How can this be, but that he is joyned in Will and Deed in

O brave <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men, look to your own defence e're it be too late; rouze up your Spirits, remember your Predeceſſors, remember how that the aſſerting of their liberties, juſtified both by ſucceſs and Law, the War of the Barons againſt wicked Councellors who misled the King, And will you now let that go which coſt them ſo dear? How many oppreſſing Kings have been depoſed in this Nation, as appears in Records referr'd unto in that worthy <hi>Patriots</hi> Hiſtory of the Succeſſion; were not <hi>Rich.</hi> 2<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

Though <hi>Mahometariſm</hi> and the K. of <hi>Morocco,</hi> were no ſuch Enemies to our rights and liberties as <hi>Popery</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> King are. Is it not time then that all ſhould be ready? Let the City of <hi>London</hi> ſtand by the Parliament for the maintaining of their Liberties and Religion in an extream way, if Parliame<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
