            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="2">2. That if the Parliament ſhall pleaſe to admit theſe things into debate and conſideration, at the deſire of the Army in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of themſelves, and the Kingdome, and to proceed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, for a generall ſatisfaction therein, we ſhall then deſire;

That the perſons impeached in the ſaid charge may be forthwith ſuſpended from ſitting in the Houſe, without which we cannot reaſonably expect ſuch proceeding upon any the things we have propoſed, as may probably bring the ſame to an happy or timely iſſue to the Kingdome or our ſelves, or as may prevent the preſent deſignes and practiſes ſo eminently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangering the peace of this Nation, if those ſame perſons (who have notoriouſly appeared moſt active in all the late procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings; to the prejudice and provocation of the Army, and haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarding thus far the peace of the Kingdome) ſhall continue in the ſame power, Judges of thoſe things relating to the Armies ſatisfaction, and peace of the Kingdome.</item>
                  <item>II. That there may be a Moneths pay at leaſt, immediately ſent down to the Army for a preſent ſupply, out of which the

Army ſhall pay 14. dayes quarter for time to come, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 14 dayes pay ſhall be accounted as part of Arrears: And to this we muſt deſire a preſent Reſolution to be with us on Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day next, by noon at fartheſt.</item>
                  <item>III. That if the Officers and Souldiers of the Army who have ingaged for Ireland, or thoſe who have deſerted the Army and come to London, have ſince then received more then a Moneths pay, there may be ſo much more money ſent down to the Army, above the moneths pay afore mentioned, as may make up that moneths pay to the Army equall to what ſuch Officers and Souldiers have ſo received at London or elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</item>
                  <item>IV. That no Officers or Souldiers who have ſo deſerted the Army ſhall have any more paid then as for Arrears, untill the reſt of the Army ſhall firſt be ſatisfied in point of their Arrears.</item>
