            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>UPon <hi>Wedneſday, March</hi> the 25th, 1674. The Court being ſate, <hi>William Alſop</hi> alias <hi>Thomas Topham,</hi> was called to the Barr, and Two Indictments read againſt him; The One of <hi>Treaſon</hi> for Clipping of Money; The other for <hi>Murther.</hi> That of Treaſon to this Effect, <hi>That he the ſaid</hi> William Alſop <hi>alias</hi> Thomas Topham, <hi>and</hi> James Alſop <hi>ſenior, and Others, of</hi> Weſt-Ham <hi>in the County of</hi> Eſſex, <hi>had Trayterouſly and Feloniouſly againſt the Peace of our Sovereign Lord the King, his Crown and Dignity, with certain Iron Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Sheers, Sciſsers, and other Tools then and there found, Clipped Filed, and Diminiſhed the Kings Coyn,</hi> viz. <hi>Fourty pieces of Silver, each of them of the value of</hi> 12 d. <hi>commonly called Queen</hi> Elizabeths <hi>Shillings, and Clipped from off them ſilver to the value of three pence; Forty other pieces of Silver commonly called King</hi> James <hi>his Shillings, and Clipped off ſilver to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of three pence; Forty pieces of Silver called King</hi> Charles <hi>the Firſt his Shillings, and clipped off from them ſilver to the value of three pence; And Twenty other pieces of Money, called King</hi> Charles the Firſt <hi>his half Crowns, and clipped ſilver from each of them to the value of Eight pence, &amp;c.</hi> (according to the uſual Form of Indictments.)</p>
            <p>To theſe Two Indictments <hi>William Allſop</hi> pleaded Guilty, and ſeemed to Excuſe the reſt, <hi>viz.</hi> his Father, Mother, and Brother.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>William Allſop</hi> being ſet by, <hi>James Allſop</hi> the Elder, and <hi>Dorothy Allſop</hi> the Wife of <hi>James Allſop</hi> the Elder, and <hi>James Allſop junior,</hi> was called to the Barr, and the Indictments to the ſame effect with the former was read; to which they pleaded <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> and ſubmitted themſelves to their Tryal by <hi>God and the Country:</hi> Upon which, the ſeveral Witneſſes
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:36569:3"/>
was called and ſworn; <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt the Bell-Man, Two Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables of <hi>Weſt-Ham,</hi> and ſeveral others. The Conſtables and Bell-Man gave in their Evidence thus; The Bell-man decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That upon the <hi>Tueſday</hi> morning, the time that the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was committed, he paſſed by the houſe of <hi>James Allſop</hi> ſenior, and gave him the uſual Salute, and the time of the Night, and was anſwered again by the ſaid <hi>James Allſop,</hi> and that he ſaw no light in the houſe; neither did he hear the dogs bark as they uſe to do oftentimes to his Affrightment: which dogs, as he was afterwards informed, were ſhut up in the Barn; and, as it was ſuppoſed, to prevent any diſturbance by their noiſe, to their intended bloody deſign. In the morning, the Murther being noiſed about, ſeveral people, as well Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers as others, flocked to the houſe to enquire about it; amongſt which, he enquired of <hi>James Allſop</hi> ſenior, and his Wife, about the Murther; they both told him, That they had been robbed that night, and the perſons that rob'd them, had done the Murther: But the Officers was not ſufficiently ſatisfied with their anſwer, but made a farther ſearch into the houſe, and found a Cheſt in the Chamber, where the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was committed, empty; which they ſaid was their Daughters Cheſt, wherein was Plate and wearing Clothes; but ſearching their Chamber, they found the Clothes which they pretended to be ſtole; and alſo found in their Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Chamber a Silver Spoon, and a Silver Cup ſtanding by the Bed; ſo that if Robbery was the intention, they would have taken away thoſe things.</p>
            <p>Next, the Conſtable agrees in a great part of the Evidence of the Bell-Man, but gives this farther, That when he was about to carry <hi>James Alſop</hi> before a Juſtice of the Peace, he deſired to go into his houſe, pretending to make faſt his Dores; which the Conſtable granted; but he would have gone into his Chamber by himſelf, which the Conſtable would not agree to: Then he deſired that he onely would go along with him; which he did, and being alone, he pulled
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:36569:3"/>
out of his Breeches a Bundle tyed up in Leather, in which was ſeveral Clippings of Money. He tells the Conſtable, That this Bundle he found laſt Night coming home between <hi>Mile-End,</hi> and <hi>Bow,</hi> and knowing, that upon this unhappy Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident (as he called it) theſe things being found about him, it might do him a great prejudice, he would therefore give him Ten pounds if he would conceal theſe Clippings; but the Conſtable told him, he dar'd not do it, and brought him out to the Company, and ſhewed what he found about him: Upon this they make narrower ſearch, and find in a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber where Wooll uſed to be laid up, in the Wooll was hid ſeveral Sheers, and a Whetſtone with ſeveral furrows in it, ſuppoſed to be for the ſmoothing of the money after it was clipped. <hi>(Here the Sheers, Sciſsers, and other Tools, and Whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, with the Clippings bound up in Leather, were ſhewn in Court, and handled and viewed by the Judge, and moſt of the Jury.)</hi> That when they firſt heard of theſe Clippings found, they went to the houſe, and ſearched narrowly the parts of the ſame, in order to make further diſcovery; and in a Window in one of the Chambers, they found Clippings and Filings, and the Impreſſion of the Tooles, and ſpyed in a Crevice ſomething glyſter, upon which they took up the boards, and there found hanging in the Cobwebs ſeveral ſmall Clippings and filings of Silver, ſome of which he ſhewed in Court</p>
            <p>The next Evidence was the other Conſtable, which was much to the ſame effect with his Partners, and agreed in the ſame Circumſtances.</p>
            <p>Then there was called one that had peen a Servant in his houſe, and lived ſo near to the Chamber where they were ſuppoſed to Clip, that he and his Wife often heard a <hi>Tinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-Noiſe;</hi> He declares, That he never ſaw any thing of their Clipping, but his Wife and he had often been diſcourſing about the <hi>Noiſe</hi> they heard, and ſhe told her husband, That when ſhe lived in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> ſhe lived next to a houſe where ſhe heard ſuch <hi>Noiſes</hi> in the Night, and that afterwards there
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:36569:4"/>
was a Diſcovery made of clipping of mony; and ſhe-wiſhed this might not prove ſo. He declared alſo that he had taken ſeverall times Clipped many of him for wages, and thought ſometimes it looked as if it was but new done; Whereupon he once ſaid to his Maſter, when they were drinking together, <hi>Maſter; I doe not like this Tink-a-tink-tink we often hear in your Chamber, pray God you be John;</hi> Upon which he was very inquiſitive to know what he meant by the <hi>Tink-a-tink-tink;</hi> he told him, he would ſay no more. A while after <hi>James Allſop</hi> arreſted this Servant in a vexatious ſuit, but tould him if he would talke no more of <hi>Tink-a-tink-tink,</hi> he would releaſe him; And that after he was apprehended, and the Clippings diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, he told <hi>James Allſop, That now was come to paſs what he long feared and expected.</hi> And Afterwards when he viſited his Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the Gaol, He told him, <hi>That if he had bin worthy to know of his Obſervations and ſuſpicions of him before, he would have given him two or three hundred pound to have Concealed what he obſerved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next was called and ſworn a Gold-ſmith, that bought the melted ſilver of this <hi>James Allſop,</hi> he declared that about two years, or two years &amp; half ſince, this <hi>James Allſop</hi> came to his ſhop, and ſhewed him ſome burnt Silver, and asked him what he would allow him, an ounce for it, And told him that a Friend of his, had a houſe burnt down in <hi>York-ſhire,</hi> and that all his plate and mony was melted and burnt in the fire; and tould him, if he would give him as much as it was worth, he could help him to more; for as faſt as they found it, and got it out of the ruins, it would be ſent to him; the Gold ſmith allowed him <hi>four Shillings Ten pence</hi> an ounce, and bought at that time about <hi>four pound weight</hi> of him; and ſaid, that this <hi>James Allſop</hi> ſould to him about four or five times afterwards, of melted ſilver about <hi>three or four pound weight</hi> at a time; and that he ordered letters to be left for him at his ſhop, and ſhewed him ſome ſubſcribed by one <hi>Nich. Campion,</hi> who was pretended to be the Perſon that ſent this ſilver out of <hi>York-ſhire;</hi> the Gold-ſmith produced ſome part of the ſilver and ſhewed it in Court.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Allſop</hi> was called and asked what he had to ſay for himſelf, he made a long, tedious, and impertinent diſcourſe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:36569:4"/>
in his defence, endeavouring to lay't all upon his Son <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam,</hi> that had Confeſſed, and brought a Boy or two that lived in his houſe to ſay, That the <hi>Tinking noiſe</hi> in his houſe was pointing of Nails to hang Leather on, and ſeveral other idle excuſes he made.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Dorothy Allſop</hi> was called, the evidence againſt her for this Indictment was onely, That ſhe had bin with her husband at the Gold-ſmiths.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>James Allſop Junior</hi> was called, and little could be faſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon him by the evidence.</p>
            <p>Then the ſecond Indictment was read againſt <hi>Jeames Allſop junior</hi> for Clipping, and there was Produced in Court a Portmantle, in which was clippings, and Sheeres, and other Inſtruments, with ſome letters ſubſcribed by <hi>Nich. Campion,</hi> which was after found to be done and Contrived by <hi>James Allſop Junior,</hi> and <hi>William Allſop</hi> who perſonated this <hi>Nich. Campion,</hi> ſometimes went for his man: This was found in an Ale-houſe in <hi>Moore-fields,</hi> where a perſon that went by the name of <hi>Campion</hi> lodged, and this Portmantle was brought thither by this young <hi>Allſop,</hi> who went there as <hi>Campions</hi> man; There was ſeverall Circumſtances to prove this Port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantle to be made in young <hi>Allſops</hi> houſe, and that they there contrived it, and carried it from thence to <hi>Moor-fields,</hi> but nothing poſitively could be proved.</p>
            <p>Then there was read the Indictment of <hi>Murder</hi> againſt <hi>James Allſop,</hi> the Elder, and <hi>Dorothy Allſop,</hi> his Wife, the evidence was firſt by the Coroner, who ſaid, That when he had, viewed the body, and had examined <hi>Allſop</hi> and his wife, who tould him, That their houſe had bin Robbed, and the Theeves had murdered their daughter in bed; the Coroner demanded of them which way the thieves came in, they tould him, That they came in at ſuch a window, The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roner went into the yard, and viewed the place, and found the glaſe lying behind a hedge, and as Carefully ſet as any Glaſier could ſet it; there being no part broken: he could like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe diſcover no foot-ſteps either in the graſs, which was
<pb facs="tcp:36569:5"/>
high, or print of any foot or toe in the wall, by which they ſhould aſcend to the window; And viewing the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, they found it full of Cobwebs, which went Croſs it, and not a part above the breath of a hand broke in them, ſo that it was impoſſible for any perſon to come in there, the Cobwerbs remaining whole.</p>
            <p>A little Child was then brought, which was the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the young woman that was murdered; ſhe ſaid, that ſhe ſaw ſome body go out of the chamber in the night with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any light ſhe thought, about the height of her Grandmother; and that ſhe found her ſelf wet in bed, but knew not what was the reaſon of it; but in the morning ſhe went and told her Grandfather, <hi>That her Mother was kill'd;</hi> who anſwered, <hi>God forbid;</hi> and that was all ſhe could declare.</p>
            <p>The next was the Surgeons Evidence, who declared, That hearing of the Murther, he came to the houſe, and viewed the Wound, and came down and found Mris. <hi>Allſop</hi> ſmoaking a Pipe of Tobacco by the fire; he asked her, Who did the Murther? She anſwered, <hi>The Lord knowes.</hi> He enquired for her husband, She told him he was gone out juſt before he came in.
