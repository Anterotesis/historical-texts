            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
CHARACTER.</head>
            <p>THE Discourses which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
this Book, being printed
already, in another Language,
there may be several amongst us,
who have only heard in general of
<hi>Monsieur St. Euremont,</hi> and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
he has with the Men of
Sence, and therefore may be well
enough pleas'd to know what it is,
wherein he Excels, and which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishes
him from other Writers.
For it is not with the Wits of our
Times, how Eminent so ever, as
with those who lived under <hi>Augustus</hi>
when the Empire and Language
<pb facs="tcp:44396:3"/>
were in some Sence Universal. They
properly wrote to the World: the
Moderns, even the French Authors
themselves, write at most but to a
Province of the <hi>Roman Empire;</hi> and
if they are known beyond their own
Country, and become a Common
Bene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it to Mankind, it is, in a great
measure, owing to their Translators.
<hi>Monsieur St. Euremont</hi> hath establish'd
his Fame where-ever the <hi>French</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
is understood, and yet surely
he cannot be displeas'd with an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
to carry it farther, by making
him speak that of a Country, where
he has resided so many Years.</p>
            <p>Whoever reads these Essays will
acknowledge, that he finds there a
Fineness of Expression, and a Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cateness
of Thought, the Easiness of
a Gentleman, the Exactness of a
Scholar, and the Good Sence of a
Man of Business: That the Author
<pb facs="tcp:44396:3"/>
is throughly acquainted with the
World, and has conversed with the
best sort of Men to be found in it.
His Subjects are often Great and
Noble, and then he never fails to
write up to them; when he speaks
of the Ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> you would
believe you were reading one of the
same Age and Nation: the same
Spirit, the same Noble Freedom,
the same unaffected Greatness ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in both; if the Subject he
chuseth be of a lower Nature, he is
sure to write that which is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
upon it: there is still somewhat
New and Agreeable, and beyond
what you could expect. However
you were affected when you began
to read him, he gains upon you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ibly,
and before you have done,
you take a pleasure to be of the same
Opinion with him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:44396:4"/>The Variety and Choice of his
Subjects pleases you no less, than
what he writes upon them: He per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually
entertains you with new
Objects, and dwells not too long
upon any of them. As for Method,
it is Inconsistent with his Design,
neither pretends he to write all that
can be said: He sets not up for a
Teacher, but he Instructs you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares,
and without pretending to
it: Every thing appears so Natural,
that the Art is hidden, and yet the
Observer finds all the stroaks of a
Master's Hand: He knows exactly
when to give over: All is so well,
you'll wish he had said more; and
yet when he concludes, you believe
he could not have ended better. He
has truly studied Nature in that
point, that it is with the Mind, as
with the Body, they are to be treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
alike: the desires of both should
<pb facs="tcp:44396:4"/>
be satisfied, yet so that you are to
rise with an Appetite.</p>
            <p>I know, how Nice an Undertaking
it is to write of a Living Author:
Yet the Example of Father <hi>Bouhours,</hi>
has somewhat encourag'd me in this
Attempt. Had not <hi>Monsieur St. Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remont</hi>
been very considerable in his
own Country, that Famous Jesuit
wou'd not have ventur'd to praise a
Person in Disgrace with the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>France,</hi> and living here in
Banishment. Yet in his <hi>Pensees In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genieuses,</hi>
he has often cited our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's
Thoughts and his Expressions,
as the Standard of Judicious Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and Graceful Speaking. An
undoubted sign that his Merit was
sufficiently establish'd, when the
Disfavour of the Court cou'd not
prevail against it. There is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a justness in his Conceptions, which
is the Foundation of good writing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb facs="tcp:44396:5"/>
but also a Purity of Language, and a
beautiful turn of Words, so little
understood by Modern Writers;
and which indeed was found at <hi>Rome,</hi>
but at the latter end of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
and ended with <hi>Petro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>
under the Monarchy. If I
durst extend my Judgment to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
I wou'd say that our Author
has determined very nicely in his
Opinion of <hi>Epicurus;</hi> and that
what he has said of his Morals, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Nature, and Reason.
'Tis true, that as I am a Religious
Admirer of <hi>Virgil,</hi> I cou'd wish that
he had not discover'd our Father's
Nakedness. But after all, we must
confess that <hi>AEneas</hi> was none of the
greatest Hero's, and that <hi>Virgil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> was
sensible of it himself. But what cou'd
he do? The <hi>Trojan</hi> on whom he was
to build the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> had been
already vanquish'd; he had lost his
<pb facs="tcp:44396:5"/>
Country, and was a Fugitive. Nay
more, he had fought unsuccessfully
with <hi>Diomedes,</hi> and was only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
from Death by his Mother
Goddess, who receiv'd a Wound
in his Defence. So that <hi>Virgil</hi> bound
as he was to follow the Footsteps
of <hi>Homer,</hi> who had thus described
him, cou'd reasonably have altered
his Character, and raised him in <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
to a much greater height of
Prowess than he found him formerly
in <hi>Troy.</hi> Since therefore he cou'd
make no more of him in Valour,
he resolved not to give him that Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
as his Principal, but chose
another, which was Piety. 'Tis
true this latter, in the Composition
of a Hero, was not altogether so
shining as the former; but it intitled
him more to the favour of the Gods,
and their Protection, in all his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings.
And, which was the
<pb facs="tcp:44396:6"/>
Poets chiefest aim, made a nearer
Resemblance betwixt <hi>AEneas</hi> and his
Patron <hi>Augustus Caesar,</hi> who, above
all things, lov'd to be flatter'd for
being Pious, both to the Gods and
his Relations. And that very Piety,
or Gratitude, (call it which you
please,) to the Memory of his Uncle
<hi>Iulius,</hi> gave him the Preference a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the Soldiers to <hi>Mark Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;</hi>
and consequently raised him to
the Empire. As for Personal Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
that of <hi>Augustus</hi> was not push<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and the Poet, who was not
ignorant of that Defect, for that
reason, durst not ascribe it, in the
supream degree, to him who was to
represent his Emperour, under an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
name: which was manag'd
by him, with the most imaginable
fineness: for had Valour been set up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permost,
<hi>Augustus</hi> must have yielded
to <hi>Agrippa.</hi> After all, this is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:44396:6"/>
to defend the Courtier, than
the Poet; and to make his Hero
escape again, under the covert of a
Cloud. Only we may add, what
I think <hi>Bossu</hi> says, That the <hi>Roman</hi>
Commonwealth, being now chang'd
into a Monarchy, <hi>Virgil</hi> was help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to that Design; by in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating
into the People the Piety of
their New Conquerour, to make
them the better brook this Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
which was brought on them
by a Man, who was favour'd by the
Gods: Yet we may observe, that
<hi>Virgil</hi> forgot not, upon occasion, to
speak Honourably of <hi>AEneas,</hi> in
point of Courage, and that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
in the Person of him by
whom he was overcome. For <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omedes</hi>
compares him with <hi>Hector,</hi>
and even with advantage.</p>

            <p>As for that particular Passage,
cited by <hi>Monsieur St. Euremont,</hi>
where <hi>Aeneas</hi> shows the utmost fear,
in the beginning of a Tempest:
<hi>Extemplo AEneae solvuntur frigore
membra, &amp;c.</hi> Why may it not be
supposed, that having been long at
Sea, he might be well acquainted
with the Nature of a Storm; and by
the rough beginning, foresee the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
and danger of it? At least, as
a Father of his People, his concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
might be greater for them, than
for himself. And if so, what the
Poet takes from the merit of his
Courage, is added to the prime ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of his Character, which was his
<pb facs="tcp:44396:7"/>
Piety. Be this said, with all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Respect and Deference, to
the Opinion of <hi>Monsieur St. Euremont;</hi>
amongst whose admirable Talents,
that of Penetration is not the least:
He generally dives into the very bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of his Authors; searches into
the inmost recesses of their Souls,
and brings up with him, those hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Treasures which had escap'd the
Diligence of others. His Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Grand <hi>Alexandre,</hi> in my
Opinion, is an admirable piece of
Criticism; and I doubt not, but
that his Observations on the <hi>English
Theatre</hi> had been as absolute in their
kind, had he seen with his own
Eyes, and not with those of other
Men. But conversing in a manner
wholly with the Court, which is
not always the truest Judge, he has
been unavoidably led into Mistakes,
and given to some of our Coursest
<pb facs="tcp:44396:8"/>
Poets a Reputation abroad, which
they never had at home. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Had his
Conversation in the Town been
more general, he had certainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
other Idea's on that Subject;
and not transmitted those Names in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his own Country, which will be
forgotten by Posterity in ours.</p>
            <p>Thus I have contracted my
Thoughts on a Large Subject: for
whatever has been said falls short of
the true Character of <hi>Monsieur St. Eure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi>
and his Writings: and if the
Translation you are about to read
does not every where come up to
the Original, the Translator de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
you to believe, that it is only
because that he has failed in his
Undertaking.</p>

            <head>REFLECTIONS
Upon the
Divers GENIUS'S
Of the
Roman People,
In the different times of the
REPUBLICK.</head>
            <head>CHAP. I.</head>
            <p>IT is with the Original of People, as
with the Genealogies of private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
they cannot bear with low and
obscure beginnings: these are pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
imaginary, those shew themselves in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.
Men are naturally defective in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:44396:10"/>
things, and naturally vain; amongst
whom the Founders of States, Legislators
and Conquerors, little satisfied with their
Human condition, whose defects and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities
they had a sense of, have frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enquired after the causes of their merits
elsewhere; from whence it comes to pass
that the Ancients held themselves obliged
to some Deity or other, either upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of descending from it, or el<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e because
they acknowledged a particular Care and
Protection from its Tutelary Vertue. Some
persons have been under a seeming perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
thereof, purely for the sake of perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
others, and have made an Ingenious
Use of an Advantagious Deceit, which
might afford a Veneration for their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and a submission to their Authority.
There have been those that have flattered
themselves with such thoughts, and seem'd
to be in earnest; The Contempt they used
men with, and the confident opinion of
their own extraordinary qualities, has oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion'd
their fantastical search after an
Original different from ours; but it has
been more frequent that some Nations to
make themselves Honoured, and through
a Spirit of Gratitude to those that had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:44396:10"/>
them some very important Services,
have given occasion for these sort of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> have not been exempt from
this Vanity. They are not contented with
their Relation to <hi>Venus</hi> by <hi>AEneas,</hi> who led
the <hi>Trojans</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> they have refreshed
their Alliance with the Gods by the Fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Nativity of <hi>Romulus,</hi> whom they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to be the Son of the God <hi>Mars,</hi> and
whom they Deif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed himself after his
Death.</p>
            <p>His Successor <hi>Numa</hi> had nothing of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
in his Race, but the Sanctity of his
Life afforded him a particular Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
with the Goddess <hi>Egeria,</hi> which
Commerce was of no small assistance to
him towards the establishment of his Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies.</p>
            <p>In short, if you will believe them, the
Destinies had no other cares upon them
than the Foundation of <hi>Rome,</hi> and so far,
that Providence seem'd Industrious to
adapt the various Inclinations of its Kings,
to the different Necessities of that People.
I hate admirations founded upon Tales, or
established through the Error of false Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
There are so many realities to be
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44396:11"/>
admired amongst the <hi>Romans,</hi> that to be
willing to advance 'em by Fables, is to do
them wrong; to be truly serviceable to
their Memory, is to rescind all vain Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations:
In this design I am inclined
to consider them by themselves, without any
subjection to such and such opinions, which
are not believed, and yet are kept up. It
would be a tedious piece of business to
give an exact account of every thing, but
I shall not amuse my self about the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
of actions; I'l be content with pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing
the Genius of some memorable
times, and the different Spirit, wherewith
<hi>Rome</hi> has been observed to be variously
animated.</p>
            <p>The Kings have had so little a share in
the Grandeur of the <hi>Roman</hi> People, that
they don't oblige me to very particular
considerations: 'Tis with reason that Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians
have entituled their Reign the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy
of <hi>Rome,</hi> for 'tis certain that under
them she has had but a very feeble mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
To be convinced of the little Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they were concerned in, it suffices to
know that seven Kings at the end of Two
Hundred, so many years, have not left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
them a Dominion much larger than
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44396:11"/>
that of <hi>Parma</hi> or <hi>Mantua:</hi> One single Battel
now a days gain'd in very narrow places,
would afford a greater extent of Land.
As for those various and singular Talents
which are ascribed to each of them by a
mysterious Providence, there's nothing of
any more consideration, than what has
happened to many Princes before; 'tis an
extraordinary thing to find a Successor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
with the same Qualities of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessor:
The one Ambitious and Active,
thinks nothing of Value but War: Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who naturally loves Repose, thinks
the finest Policy in the World consists in
keeping himself in Peace; this makes Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
his principal Vertue, that Prince is
Zealous after nothing, but the observance
of Religion; so that each pursues his own
natural Disposition, and is delighted in
the exercise of his Talent; now to make
a sort of a Miracle of so ordinary a thing,
is it not very ridiculous? But further, This
Difference of Genius is so far distant from
procuring any Advantage to the <hi>Roman</hi>
People, that their small encrease under
the Kings, in my Judgment, is to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
thereto; certainly nothing can be a
greater hindrance to a Progress than this
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44396:12"/>
difference of Genius, for it oftentimes is
the occasion of quitting the real Interest,
which is not understood, by a new Spirit,
which would introduce something that
one has a better notion of, but which for
the most part is inconsistent with the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd
advantage.</p>
            <p>Allowing you could come at all you
intended by these new Institutions, yet
it happens many times from the diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of applications, that several things were
fortunately enough begun, without arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to a happy accomplishment.</p>
            <p>The disposition of affairs was all of a
piece under <hi>Romulus.</hi> In <hi>Numa</hi>'s Reign
nothing was performed, but the establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Priests, and Religious persons. <hi>Tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Hostilius</hi> found it no easie Province to
Convert men from a pleasant amusement,

was hardly established, but that <hi>Ancu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The first <hi>Tarq<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to the Senate, and more of Majesty to the
Government, invented Ornaments, and
gave marks of Distinction.</p>
            <p>The Principal Study of <hi>Servius,</hi> was to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44396:12"/>
have an exact account of the estates of the
<hi>Romans,</hi> and according to those, to divide
them by Tribes, that so they might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
with Justice and Proportion to the
Publick Nece<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ities.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tarquin</hi> the Proud, says <hi>Florus,</hi> was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
serviceable to his Countrey, when
he gave occasion by his Tyranny to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
the Republick; this is the Discourse
of a <hi>Roman,</hi> who, although born in the
Reign of Emperours, doth not think it
ami<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s to prefer Liberty to the Empire.</p>
            <p>My Opinion is, that the Common-Wealth
may be justly admired, without admiring
the manner of its Constitution. But to
return to these Kings, 'tis certain that
each had his particular Talent, but not
one, a capacity large enough. <hi>Rome</hi> should
have had some of those great Monarchs,
that know how to embrace all things by
the Advantage of a Universal Genius, and
not to be under the necessity of borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from different Princes, the divers In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions,
which one might easily have
composed, during his particular Life.</p>
            <p>The Reign of <hi>Tarquin</hi> is as well known
to the World, as the establishment of their
Liberty. Pride, Cruelty, and Avarice, were
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44396:13"/>
his chiefest qualities, but he wanted dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to manage his Tyranny.</p>
            <p>He had much of Injustice and Violence
in him, his Designs ill contrived, and his
measures ill taken. To define his conduct
in a few words, he knew neither how to
Govern according to the Laws, nor Reign
against them: In a State so violent for the
People, and dangerous for the Prince, there
was nothing expected, but an opportunity
for Liberty, when the death of the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<hi>Lucretia,</hi> presented one to their
view.</p>
            <p>This Vertuous Lady, so cruel to her self,
could not Pardon her self for the Crime
of another, she Stab'd her self with her
own proper hands, after she had been ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d
by <hi>Sextus,</hi> and commended the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
of her Honour to <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus.</hi>
'Twas then that this constraint of
Humours, so long since pen'd up, made
the first Rupture.</p>
            <p>It is incredible how all people agreed
to revenge the death of <hi>Lucretia;</hi> the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
to whom the slightest matter rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
thereunto served for a specious rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
were more incensed against <hi>Sextus</hi>
for the Violence <hi>Lucretia</hi> offered her self,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44396:13"/>
than if he had really himself been the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of it; and as it generally happens
in Tragical events, by the mixture of Pity
and Indignation, every one augmented the
Horror of the Crime, by a Compassion for
this Celebrated, but Unfortunate Vertue.</p>
            <p>You may observe in <hi>Livy,</hi> the very least
particulars of the concern and conduct of
the <hi>Romans,</hi> an odd mixture of Fury and
Wisdom, very ordinary in great Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
where Violence produceth the same
effect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, that Heroick Vertue doth when ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with Discipline; 'Tis certain
that <hi>Brutus</hi> made an admirable use of the
Dispositions of the People; but to describe
him well, is a Task of no mean difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
The Grandeur of a Republick admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by the whole World, occasions an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
of the Founder thereof without
an examination of his Actions.</p>
            <p>Every thing that appears Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
appears Great if it be Successful;
as every thing which is Great, appears
Foolish, when there's a contrary Event.
It were necessary to have lived in his time,
and to have had some experience of his
person, to be perfectly satisfied whether
he Kill'd his Sons by a motion of Heroick
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44396:14"/>
Vertue, or the hardness of a Cruel and
Unnatural Humour.</p>
            <p>As for me, I'm of Opinion that there's
much of his Conduct owing to Design:
His profound Dissimulation under the
Reign of <hi>Tarquin,</hi> as well as his industry
to chase <hi>Collatinus</hi> from the Consulship, is
to me matter of a convincing nature. It
might very well be, that the Sentiments
of Liberty made him forget those of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
It might also be that his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Security prevail'd with him above all
things, that in this hard and melancholy
choice of undoing himself, or undoing his
Children, so urgent an Interest overcame
in him the safety of his Family. Who
knows if Ambition had not a share in this
action? <hi>Collatin</hi> ruined himself through a
a natural affection for his Nephews; <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
rendred himself Master of the Publick
by the Rigorous Punishment of his own
Sons. That which may with assurance be
affirmed is this, that there was something
of Cruelty in his Nature, that was the
Genius of the time; a disposition as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage
as it is free, did then, and has very
long since produced Vertues, that are not
rightly apprehended.</p>

            <head>CHAP. II.</head>
            <p>IN the first times of the Republick,
people were strangely furious for Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
and the Publick Good; the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
they bore to their Country, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no Obligation to the motion of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
the Zeal of the Citizen robbed the
Man of himself. Sometimes through a
Savage Justice, the Father caused his Son
to Die for the performance of some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
exploit contrary to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands;
sometimes he made himself a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctim,
through a Superstition as Cruel as it
was Ridiculous; as if the intention of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
were to oblige us to Dye, when it
was instituted to encourage us to live
with less Danger, and with greater Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
Valour had I know not what of
Cruelty in it, and an Obstinacy of Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
supplied the place of Discipline in
War. In Conquests was as yet observed
nothing of Generosity, it was not an aspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Spirit which sought after an Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Superiority over others: To speak
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44396:15"/>
with something of Propriety, the <hi>Romans</hi>
were Violent Neighbours, who were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to exclude from their Possessions the
Legitimate Owners, and to Manure the
Lands of other People by Force; often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the Victorious Consul was in no
better a Condition than the Conquered
People; the refusing the Spoil has cost him
his Life, the division of it has caused his
Banishment; they have refused to go to
War under the Conduct of some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Generals, and denied to Conquer under
others. Sedition was easily taken for the
effect of Liberty, which was supposed to
be prejudiced by the least mark of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance,
even to those Magistrates that
they themselves had made, and those Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
whom they had Chosen.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Genius</hi> of this People was as Rusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
as it was Wild; Dictators were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
taken from the Plough, which they
took to again after the end of their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition,
not so much by a preference of
an innocent and undisturbed Condition,
as for having been accustomed to a sort
of life so unpolite and unsociable. As
for that Frugality which is so extreamly
boasted of, it was not a retrenchment of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44396:15"/>
superfluities, or a voluntary abstinence
from things agreeable, but a gross usage
of what they presently enjoyed. '<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

true they were not Ambitious after more
Riches, because they did not understand
them, they were content with a little, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they conceived no more, those Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
too they omitted, of which they
had no Idea. Notwithstanding for want
of a due reflection, these old <hi>Romans</hi> were
taken for the most considerable persons
of the World; for their Posterity has Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated
the very least particulars of their
Actions, whether it is, that people natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
respect beginners of Great Actions,
or that their Posterity, glorious throughout,
were desirous that their Ancestors should
be Masters of Vertues, when they were not
of Greatness. I know very well that one
might alledge some particular Actions of
an extream Vertue, which will serve for
Patterns to all Ages; but these Actions
were done by certain persons, which did
in no measure resemble the <hi>Genius</hi> of the
time, or else they were Actions of so sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
a nature, which proceeding from
Men by Accident, had in them nothing
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:44396:16"/>
common with the ordinary course of their
lives.</p>
            <p>It is to be acknowledged nevertheless,
that manners so Unpolished and Rustical
were agreeable enough to a Rising Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth.
This roughness of Humour,
which never yielded to Difficulties, esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
<hi>Rome</hi> on a stronger Foundation, than
one more tractable, more enlightned, and
rational, could have done.</p>
            <p>This Quality considered in it self, to
speak apprehensively, was very Savage,
which deserves no respect but by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation
of Antiquity, and because
it has afforded a Beginning to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est

            <p>THE First Wars of the <hi>Romans</hi> were
of very great Importance in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
but little remarkable, if you except
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44396:16"/>
the extraordinary actions of some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.
It is certain that the Interest of the
Common-Wealth could not possibly be
greater, since there was some likelihood
of their returning under the Subjection
of the <hi>Tarquins;</hi> since <hi>Rome</hi> could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
it self from the resentments of <hi>Corio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanus,</hi>
but by the Tears of his Mother; and
that the defence of the <hi>Capitol</hi> was the ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
refuge of the <hi>Romans,</hi> seeing that
after the defeat of their Forces, their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
City was taken and Sacked by the <hi>Gauls.</hi>
But considering these Expeditions in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
one shall find that they were rather
Tumults, than real Wars; and to speak the
Truth, if so be the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> had seen
the kind of War-like Discipline which the
<hi>Romans</hi> practised in those times, I que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
not, but they would have taken
for <hi>Barbarians,</hi> a Nation, that took off the
Reins of their Horses, to make their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry
the more impetuous, a Nation, who
depended on Geese and Dogs for their
Guard, as a Security sufficient, whose neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
they punished, and recompensed
their Watchfulness. This gross Custom of
wageing War, was of no small continuance,
the <hi>Romans</hi> have purchas'd many conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44396:17"/>
Conquests with an indifferent Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity:
they were a people of bravery e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
and but little understood, who were
concerned with Adversaries less Couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and more ignorant, but because the
Captains were nominated Consuls and
Dictators, their Troops called Legions,
and their Souldiers <hi>Romans,</hi> there has been
more ascribed to the Vanity of these Names,
than the Truth of things; and without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining
the distinction of Times and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
people would imagine, that they
were the same Arms under the Commands
of <hi>Camillus, Manlius, Cincinnatus, Papiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,
Cursor,</hi> and <hi>Curius Dentatus,</hi> as under
<hi>Scipio, Marius, Sylla, Pompey</hi> and <hi>Caesar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which may be affirmed to have
been in the Primitive times of the <hi>Romans,</hi>
is an extraordinary Courage<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> a great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity
of Life, a great Affection for their
Country, and an equal Valour; in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
times, a great of Discipline in War,
and every thing else, but withal abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Corruption.</p>
            <p>From thence it is come to pass, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of the highest Rank, to whom Vice
and Luxury were become odious, have not
been satisfied to admire the Probity of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:44396:17"/>
their Ancestors, if they did not extend
their admiration to the utmost degree,
without distinguishing wherein their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts
consisted, and where not. Those
that have found some occasion to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of the Age they lived in, have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded
a Thousand Encomiums to Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
which never exacted from them
the least sufferance; and those who are
so Morose as to censure and blame every
thing that's in view, by the strength of
their Imagination make that estimable
which is no more. The most reputable
persons have not been destitute of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and knowing that all Ages have
their Imperfection and Vertues, they made
a prudent Scrutiny into the Time of their
Ancestors and their own; but they
were obliged to admire with the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and to exclaim sometimes suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
enough, sometimes without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
<hi>majores nostri, majores nostri,</hi> when
they observed others to cry out in so
general an admiration. The Historians
have not been wanting in the same
respect to the Ancients, and making a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro
of every Consul, they have supposed
every one, that has been very serviceable
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:44396:18"/>
to the Republick, to be of a Consumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Vertue.</p>
            <p>I acknowledge that it was very deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to serve it, but that's a different
case from what we are upon; and it may
truly be said, that the excellent Citizens
lived amongst the ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> and the
most accomplished Generals amongst the
latter.</p>

knowledge thereof: For the <hi>Romans</hi> at

assistant to them, that they used to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
in the very heat of the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and mount again to pursue their
Foes, when defeated: 'Tis certain that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>Romans</hi> made their Strength to consist in
their Infantry, accounting the benefit,
which might be received from the Horse,
of little importance. The Legions par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
had in great misprision the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
Horse, till the War of <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi>
where the <hi>Thessalians</hi> gave 'em sufficient
cause to change their Opinions: But the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:44396:19"/>
Cavalry of <hi>Hannibal</hi> occasion'd to them
since, great Terror, and those Invincible
Legions were for some time so horribly
frighted, that they durst not appear up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the least Plain.</p>
            <p>To return to the time of <hi>Papirius,</hi> one
was hardly acquainted with the notion of
Cavalry, there was no skill either in Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or Encamping in any Order; for they
themselves acknowledge, that they learn't
to form their Camp by the disposition of
that of <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> and before were used to
Encamp always in Confusion: They were
no less ignorant of Engines, and other
works, necessary to form a considerable
Siege; which proceeded either from the
slackness of Invention of a People, not at
all Industrious, or else because their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
were never of a long continuance,
whereby there was no opportunity afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Men, to bring things to Perfection.
Rarely was one and the same Army ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
to pass from the Conduct of one
Consul, to that of another; and yet more
rarely was the Captain of the Legions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
in his Command, after the expira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Term; which management was
admirable, for the preservation of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:44396:19"/>
but very much repugnant to the
establishment of a good Army. To let you
see that the cause of this, was the Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy
of Liberty; you may observe, that after
the defeat of <hi>Thrasimene,</hi> at what time
they were obliged to create a Dictator,
<hi>Fabius</hi> had scarce stopt the Torrent of <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
by the Wisdom of his Conduct, but
they put Consuls in his place: All things
to be dreaded from the Fury of <hi>Hannibal,</hi>
nothing to be fear'd from the moderation
of <hi>Fabius;</hi> and yet the apprehension of a
remote Evil, carried them beyond the pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sent
Necessity.</p>
            <p>It is most certain, that the two Consuls
managed themselves with Prudence in this
War, and ruined <hi>Hannibal</hi> insensibly, as
they established the Common-Wealth,
when by the same reason <hi>Terentius Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi>
supplied their room, Presumptuous and
Ignorant, who gave Battel at <hi>Cannae,</hi> and
lost it, and reduced the <hi>Romans</hi> to that
extremity, that their Vertue, as extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
as it was, was not so much instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
in their preservation, as the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lessness
of <hi>Hannibal.</hi> There was another
Inconvenience, which hindred the Conduct
of the Armies from being always given
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:44396:20"/>
to the most Experienced and Capable.
The Two Consuls could not be Patricians,
and the Patricians would not agree, that
both should be of the Plebeian Order. For
the Generality it happened, that the first
which was nominated, was a person agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the People, who owed his Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to Favour; the other, whom they
had a mind to choose for his Merit, was
oftentimes excluded, either through the
opposition of the People, if he was a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trician,
or by the Intreagues of the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
when he was not of their Rank. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the <hi>Macedonians</hi> the contrary was
observed, where the Captains and Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
stood together from their first esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment:
They were like the <hi>Veterans</hi>
of <hi>Philip,</hi> that I may so speak, renewed
from time to time, and augmented by
<hi>Alexander,</hi> as his occasions required. Here
the Courage of the Cavalry equall'd the
resolution of the Phalanx, which indeed
might be preferr'd to the Legion, inasmuch
as the Legions, in the War of <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> were
afraid to oppose some miserable Phalanxes
of the <hi>Macedonians</hi> got together. Here
they were equally expert in the War, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to a Siege, or the Field. Never was
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:44396:20"/>
Army concerned against so many Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries,
or had seen so many different Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates.
If so be the diversity of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys,
wherein War is exercised, and the
variety of Nations, which are brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
submission, can form our experience,
how should the <hi>Romans</hi> enter in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
with the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> a people that
never went out of <hi>Italy,</hi> nor beheld other
Foes than a few inconsiderable Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
of their Republick? The Discipline
was in reality great amongst them, but
the Capacity of an indifferent nature.
Even since the Common-Wealth was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
more puissant, they have suffered
the disgrace of being defeated, as often as
they made War against experienc'd Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains;
<hi>Pyrrhus</hi> overcame them by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of Conduct, which made <hi>Fabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi>
declare, <hi>that the</hi> Epirotes <hi>did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
the</hi> Romans, <hi>but that the Consul had
been Vanquished by the King of the</hi> Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotes.</p>
            <p>In the first <hi>Carthaginian</hi> War, <hi>Regulus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated
the people of <hi>Carthage</hi> in <hi>Africk</hi> in so
many Engagements, that they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
lookt upon as Tributaries to <hi>Rome.</hi>
They were upon Conditions, which seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:44396:21"/>
insupportable, when <hi>Xantippus</hi> a <hi>Lacedae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monian,</hi>
arrived with a Body of Auxiliaries.
The <hi>Graecian</hi> a Man of Valour and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
informed himself of the Order and
Discipline of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> together
with the conduct of the <hi>Romans.</hi> Having
fully instructed himself, he found both
one and t'other very ignorant in War, and
by his frequent discourse thereof amongst
the Souldiers, the noise came to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Senate of <hi>Carthage,</hi> in what little esteem
this <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> held their Foes. The
Magistrates at length had the curiosity to
give attention to him, where <hi>Xantippus,</hi>
after he had given them a sense of their
past omissions, encouraged them to put
him at the head of their Troops, through
a promise of Victory.</p>
            <p>In a miserable State where all things are
despair'd of, a Man is more easily perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
rather to confide in another, than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
so those Suspicions fatal to the merit
of Strangers, came to yield to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Necessity, and the most powerful,
urged with an apprehension of their ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine,
abandoned themselves to the Conduct
of <hi>Xantippus</hi> without Envy. I should make
a History instead of alledging an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:44396:21"/>
to extend my self any further; it
suffices to say, That <hi>Xantippus</hi> becoming
the manager of affairs, altered extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Army, and knew so
well how to prevail over the Ignorance
of the <hi>Romans,</hi> that he obtained one of
the most entire Victories over them, that
ever was won. The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> out of
Danger, began to be ashamed of owing
their Preservation to a Stranger, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
to the perfidiousness of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
they thought to extinguish their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace,
by ridding themselves of him, who
had rid them of the <hi>Romans:</hi> It is not
well known, whether they put him to
Death, or that he was so Fortunate as to
escape; but this is most assured, that
through the absence of this person, the
<hi>Romans</hi> most easily regain'd the Superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
they had over them before.</p>
            <p>If you'd repair to the second <hi>Punick</hi>
War, you will observe, that the vast ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
which <hi>Hannibal</hi> received from
the <hi>Romans,</hi> proceeded from the capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the one, and the small ability of
the other; and in effect, when he would
put a confidence in his Souldiers, he never
said that his Enemies wanted Courage or
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:44396:22"/>
Resolution, for they experienced the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
often enough, but he assured them,
that they were concerned with a people
little dexterous in War.</p>
            <p>It is with this Science, as with Arts
and Politeness, it passes from one Nation
to another, and Reigns at divers times,
and in different places. Every one knows,
that the <hi>Graecians</hi> enjoyed it to a high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
<hi>Philip</hi> gained it from them, and all
things arrived to their perfection under
<hi>Alexander,</hi> when <hi>Alexander</hi> alone corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
himself: It continued still with his
Successors: <hi>Hannibal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the <hi>Romans,</hi> they have received it from
him by the experience of their Defeats,
their reflections upon their mistakes, and
the observance of the Conduct of their
Foes. You will be easily convinced of
this, if you consider, that the <hi>Romans</hi> did
not begin to make resistance against <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
in their utmost Bravery; for the
most Valiant Persons were lost in Battel.
Then there was Arming of Slaves, and
Armies composed of unexperienced Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.
The truth is this, that they were
prejudicial to him only, when the Consuls

its necessary to come to the Actions,

the following use thereof.</p>
            <p>A Physician, in whom <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> reposed
a confidence, offered his Service to <hi>Fabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius,</hi>
to Poyson his Master, provided he
might have a reward proportionable to
the importance of the action. <hi>Fabricius</hi>
scared at the Horror of the Crime, forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:44396:24"/>
with gives notice of it to the Senate, who
detesting with the Consul, so unworthy
an Action, sent to advise <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> to take
care of his person, adding, that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Peoples temper was, to overcome
him by their proper Arms, and not to free
themselves of an Enemy by the Treason of
his own People.</p>
            <p>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rhus,</hi> either sensible of the Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or astonished at this greatness of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
was more desirous than ever to
make a Peace; and to dispose the <hi>Romans</hi>
thereto with the greater easiness, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
200 Prisoners without Ransom;
he sent Presents to the most considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
persons, to the Ladies also, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
nothing under a pretence of Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
to bring Corruption amongst them.
The <hi>Romans,</hi> who had not preserv'd
<hi>Pyrrhus</hi> but by a perswasion of Vertue,
would receive nothing that had the least
Air of Acknowledgment. They sent to
him an equal number of Prisoners, the
Presents were refused by both Sexes, and
all the Answer that he had, was, <hi>That
they would never hearken to a Peace, till he
was removed out of</hi> Italy.</p>
            <p>Amongst an Infinite number of Vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:44396:24"/>
things, that were practised at this
time, the great and impartial Natures of
<hi>Fabricius</hi> and <hi>Curius,</hi> who went to a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
Poverty, were admired amongst
the rest. 'Twould be a piece of Injustice
not to allow them a great approbation;
notwithstanding 'tis to be considered that
it was more the general Quality of this
time, than a Vertue peculiar to these two
Men. And in effect since Riches were
punished with Disgrace, and Poverty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
with Honour, it appears to me,
that there was need of some Dexterity, to
know well how to be Poor. By this
means they raised themselves to the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Employments of the Republick, where
by the exercise of a great Power, they
stood in greater want of Moderation than
Patience. I cannot blame a Poverty that
was Honoured through the World, it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
wants any thing, but what our Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
or Pleasure is concerned in. To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
the Truth, these sorts of Privations
are of a delicious Nature, 'tis affording
the Mind an exquisite Relish of what the
sense is Robb'd of.</p>
            <p>But who knows if <hi>Fabricius</hi> did not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
his humour, there are some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:44396:25"/>
that are disorder'd upon a multitude
and variety of Superfluities, who in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
would taste things Commodious and
even Necessaries with Delight. In the
mean time, those that have but a false
knowledge of things, admire the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of moderation, when the exactness
of Judgment would shew the small extent
of a confined Spirit, or the little action
of some negligent Soul. With those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
to be content with little, is to rescind
less of Pleasure than of Pain. Further, when
it is not despicable to be Poor, we are in
want of fewer necessaries to live in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
with Satisfaction, than to live mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificently
with Riches. Can you imagine
the Condition of a Religious person to be
unhappy, when he is considered in his
Order, and is of some repute in the World?
He makes a Vow of Poverty, which frees
him from a Thousand Cares, and leaves
him the desire of nothing that's agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to his Profession and his Life. Those
who live magnificently, for the most part
are the real Poor, they contend for Money
on all sides with Inquietude and Disorder,
to maintain the Pleasures of others; and
whilst they expose their abundance, which
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:44396:25"/>
strangers have more advantage of than
they, in private consider their Necessity,
with their Wives and Children, through
the importunity of Tyrannizing Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
and the miserable State of their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
which they behold in a tendency to
Ruine.</p>
            <p>Let us return to our <hi>Romans,</hi> from
whom we are insensibly stept aside. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
who will, the Poverty of <hi>Fabricius,</hi>
I commend his Prudence, and find him
very much advised, to have had but one
Salt-seller of Silver, to afford him the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
of chasing from the Senate, a man that
had been twice Consul, a Triumpher, and
Dictator, because in his person they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
something more, besides that it
was the humour of the time, the real In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
was, to have no other than that of
the Republick.</p>
            <p>Men have established Society by a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of particular Interest, imagining to
live more pleasant and secure in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
than they did in frights, when in
solitudes; seeing they find therein, not
only an Advantage, but Glory and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
Can they better do, than devote
themselves wholly to the Publick, from
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:44396:26"/>
whence they attract considerably more?</p>
            <p>The <hi>Decij,</hi> who Sacrificed themselves
for the good of a Society, whom they
went to forsake, seem to me truly En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiastick;
but these people here, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
very rational in the Passion they
had for a grateful Republick, which was
at least as careful in their respect, as
they could be in hers.</p>
            <p>I represent <hi>Rome</hi> in this time as a true
Community, where every one lets alone
his Private good, to f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd a better in that
of the Body he belongs to; this Temper
subsists no where but in small Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks:
In great ones, all appearance of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
is contemned; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tis much, when
the extraordinary use of Riches is not
there approved of. Had <hi>Fabricius</hi> lived
in the Grandeur of the Republick, either
he must have changed his Manners, or he
had not been useful to his Countrey; and
if so be, the reputable Men of the latter
time, had existed in that of <hi>Fabricius,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they had made their Integrity more
rigid, or they would have been chased
from the Senate as, corrupted Citizens.</p>
            <p>After having spoken of the <hi>Romans,</hi> it is
reasonable to touch a little of <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> who
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:44396:26"/>
comes in here naturally amongst such va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of things.</p>
            <p>He was the most Expert Captain of his
time, even in the opinion of <hi>Hannibal,</hi>
who placed him immediately after <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi>
and before himself, as it seems to
me, through modesty. He joined the
curiousness of Negotiations, to the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of War; but withall, could never
make a solid establishment for himself;
If he knew how to gain Battels, he fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the issue of War; if he drew peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to his Alliance, he knew not how to
maintain them there; these two Noble
Talents unseasonably employed, ruined
the Work-manship of both.</p>
            <p>When he had succeeded to his Wish
in Fighting, his Thoughts were immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
bent to Treat; and as if he had kept
Intel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>igence with his Enemys, he obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
his own Progress. Had he known
how to win the affections of a People,
his first Thoughts would have been to
have made them subject: From hence it
came, that he lost his Friends without
gaining his Enemies; for the Conquered
took the Spirit of the Victors, and refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the Peace that was offered them,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:44396:27"/>
and they not only withdrew their assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
but considered how to get rid of an
Allie, who shew'd the temper of a real
Master.</p>
            <p>A Procedure so extraordinary, ought in
part to be ascribed to the nature of
<hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> partly to the different Interests
of his Ministers. There was amongst the
rest, two Men near his Person, whose ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
he generally followed, <hi>Cineas</hi> and
<hi>Milon. Cineas</hi> being Eloquent, Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
fit for and skill'd in Negotiations, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuated
the Thoughts of Peace, every time
he Debated upon War; and when the
Ambitious Humour of <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> had trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
him beyond his Reason; he pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently
expected Difficulties, when mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
the first distasts of his Master, he
presently turned his Inclinations to Peace,
to the end of re entring upon his Talent,
and putting the affairs in his own dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>al.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Milon</hi> was a Man experienc'd in War,
who brought back every thing to force,
he forgot nothing to hinder Treaties; or
else to break them off, advised to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Impediments; and if so be, there
was no subduing Adversary Nations, by
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:44396:27"/>
all means to reduce the Allies to Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.
As far as one may guess, behold
the Rules by which <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> governed, as
well by others as himself: It may be said
in his Favour, that he was concerned with
Powerful Nations, that could better shift
than he; and again, that he won Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels
by his Valour, that such a small and
weak State as his, would not afford him
the means to bring a long War to a
Conclusion. In short, to look upon him
through the qualities of his Person, and
his Actions, he was an admirable Prince,
who yields in no respect to any of the
Ancients. To consider in general, the
Success of his Designs, and the end of
affairs, he will often appear to have been
out of the way, and lose much of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.
To conclude, he possessed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
of <hi>Macedon,</hi> and was thence expell'd;
his beginnings in <hi>Italy</hi> were fortunate,
from whence he was forc'd to retire; he
saw himself Master of <hi>Sicily,</hi> where he
was not permitted to reside.</p>

to speak the Truth, they entred

with much Temerity and Ignorance; but
they had a great Courage to sustain it;
And as they found every thing new with

               </gap> which they had despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
without Cause. They were at length
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:44396:28"/>
instructed to form their Camp by that of
<hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> after having admired the Order
and Distinction of Troops, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp'd
with them in Confusion. As for
the things which relate purely to the
Mind, although the Harangue of old <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

drove <hi>Cineas</hi> from <hi>Rome,</hi> yet the Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of <hi>Cineas</hi> did not cease to please,
and his dexterity was very agreeable.</p>
            <p>The Presents that were offered, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the Refusal, gave a Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
for those that could make them;
and <hi>Curius,</hi> so much honoured for his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
Vertue, was still the more, when
he shew'd them in his Triumph, Gold,
Silver, Pictures, and Statues. 'Twas
then understood, that there were in other
places things more excellent than in <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus new Ideas, that I may so speak,
made new Inolinations; and the <hi>Roman</hi>
people, taken with an unknown Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence,
lost those old Opinions, where
the habit of Poverty was no less concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
than Vertue.</p>
            <p>Curiosity was excited in the Citizens,
even their hearts began to feel with emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
what the Eye had begun to see with
pleasure; and when their understandings
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:44396:29"/>
were cleared, there appeared real desires
for things abroad. Some particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
did yet preserve the ancient conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,
as it has happened since, and in
the most corrupted time of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick;
but at length, there was a general
desire of passing the Seas, to establish
themselves in places where <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> knew
how to find so much Wealth. Behold
properly, from whence proceeds the first
<hi>Carthaginian</hi> War; the Succour given to
the <hi>Tarentines</hi> was the pretext therof,
the Conquest of <hi>Sicily</hi> the true Occasion.</p>
            <p>After having said by what motives the
<hi>Romans</hi> dispos'd themselves to this War,
it is necessary, in few words, to shew
what their Genius was at that time. Their
principal Qualities in my Judgment, were
Courage and Resolution.</p>
            <p>To undertake things of the greatest
difficulty, not to be frighted with any
danger, not to be discourag'd with any
loss. In all the rest the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> had
over them a very great Superiority, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
through Industry or Experience at Sea,
or else their Wealth, which afforded 'em
the Traffick of the whole World, when the
<hi>Romans,</hi> naturally poor enough, went to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:44396:29"/>
exhaust themselves in the War of <hi>Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To speak the Truth, their Valour was
instead of all things, a good Success en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
them to the pursuit of a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and a contrary event did nothing but
exasperate them the more. It happened
directly otherwise in the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
who became careless in good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
and easily dejected in Adversity.
Besides the different nature of these two
Nations, the different constitution of the
Republicks contributed much thereto.
<hi>Carthage</hi> was established upon Commerce,
and <hi>Rome</hi> founded upon Armies. The first
employed Strangers in their Wars, and
Citizens in their Traffick: The other
made themselves Citizens of the whole
World, and of Citizens Soldiers: The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
breath'd after nothing but War,
even those that went not there, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been formerly concerned, or else
through the necessity of going one day.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Carthage</hi> they always demanded
Peace upon the first Inconvenience that
was Threatned, as well to get rid of the
Strangers, as to return to Trade. One
may yet add this difference, That the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians</hi>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:44396:30"/>
have done nothing that's great,
but by the Valour of particular Persons;
where the <hi>Roman</hi> People has often re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
by their Constancy, what the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence
or Cowardise of their Generals
had lost.</p>
            <p>All these things considered, we need
not be astonished at the <hi>Romans</hi> remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Victorious, for they had the principal
qualities, which render one People Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of another. As the Idea of Riches
made the <hi>Romans</hi> desirous of subduing
<hi>Sicily,</hi> so the Conquest of <hi>Sicily,</hi> made
them desire to enjoy those Riches which
they had got.</p>
            <p>The Peace with the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> after
so rude a War, inspired a Spirit of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
and that Repose produced the Ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and made a discovery of their first Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence.
They began to have a curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
for Shews, and an affection for Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.</p>
            <p>The Proceedings at Law, although
Enemies to Joy, did not cease to encrease,
every one having recourse to the Publick

which they did not owe, when
they were employed in the reduction of
their Rebels; and they used all the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in the World, not to break with
them, when affairs were a little accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated.</p>
            <p>So that it was sometimes Injuries, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
Considerations, always Averseness
or Fear; and certainly one may say, that
the <hi>Romans</hi> knew how to live neither as
Friends nor Enemies: for they offended
the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and suffered them to
re-establish themselves, giving cause e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for a new War, where they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
above all things Ill Success.</p>
            <p>A Conduct so uncertain, changed into
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:44396:31"/>
a true Carelessness, and they let the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guntines</hi>
be destroyed with so much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace,
that their Ambassadors were shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
treated for it by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and

            <p>The contempt of Nations, wherewith

They made War sometime with much In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity

has been found since with more of Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur;
never so true a desert: In other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities
wherein she has been engaged,
her Security was owing to the Boldness,
Valour, or Capacity of some particular
Citizen. Perhaps without <hi>Brutus,</hi> there
would have been no Common-Wealth.
If <hi>Manlius</hi> had not defended the Capitol,
if <hi>Camillus</hi> had not come to rescue it, the
<hi>Romans</hi> hardly free, would have fallen
under the Bondage of the <hi>Gauls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here the <hi>Roman</hi> People hath sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the <hi>Roman</hi> People, here the Universal
Genius of the Nation hath preserved the
Nation, here good Order, Resolution, a
general Conspiring for the Publick Good,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:44396:32"/>
have saved <hi>Rome</hi> when she was going to
fall, by the Faults and Imprudences of her
Generals.</p>
            <p>After the Battel of <hi>Cannae,</hi> where any
other State had yielded to her Ill Fortune,
there was not a motion of weakness a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the people, not a thought but
tended to the good of the Common-Wealth.
All Orders, all Ranks, all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
voluntarily exhausted their Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
the <hi>Ramans</hi> gave up with Pleasure
the most valuable things they had, and
kept with regret what they were obliged
to leave themselves for their bare use.
To retain the least, was a point of Honour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
to reserve the most in their Houses, a kind
of disgrace. When they treated about
creating Magistrates, the Youth for the
most part Jealous of one another, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted
freely the Wisdom of the more An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
to give their Suffrages the most
discreetly.</p>
            <p>Old Soldiers coming to be wanted, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
was given to the Slaves to make
new ones; and these Slaves becoming <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
were encouraged with the same
Spirit of their Master to defend the same
Liberty: But behold a greatness of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:44396:32"/>
which surpasses all other qualities,
be they never so noble. It happens some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in an eminent danger, that persons
of no remarkable Prudence, are ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erved
to take good resolutions; it happens that
the most concerned, contribute largely for
the Publick Good, when by another Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
they are afraid to ruine themselves
with the Publick.</p>
            <p>It may be, it never happened in the
World, that people took an equal care
both abroad and at home in such pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing
extremities; and I find nothing so ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
in the <hi>Romans,</hi> as to see them
send their Troops into <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> with
the same Care, as they did against <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Overwhelmed with so many Losses, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted
of Men and Money, they divided
their last Supplies between the defence of
<hi>Rome,</hi> and the preserving of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests.</p>
            <p>A People so Magnanimous, chose rather
to Perish than Fail, and to be no more,
was held as an indifferent thing, when
there was no being Masters of others.
Admitting Self-Preservation to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
advantagious, yet I reckon amongst
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:44396:33"/>
the chief advantages of the <hi>Romans,</hi> the
owing their Safety to their Constancy, and
the greatness of their Courage.</p>
            <p>This was yet a Felicity to them, to have
changed their Genius since the War of
<hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> to have quitted that extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Impartiality, and that Ambitious
Poverty which I have spoken of: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
there had not been found in <hi>Rome</hi>
means to sustain it.</p>
            <p>It was necessary that the Citizens had
Ability, as well as Zeal, to assist the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.
If so be she had not relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
her Allies, she would have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned
by them. The Discourse of a
Consul who thought to give Compassion
to the Deputies of <hi>Capua,</hi> did but excite
their Infidelity: The Senate much more
Wise, took a quite different Conduct,
sent Men and Provisions to the Allies,
which stood in want thereof; and of all
the Succours which they of <hi>Naples</hi> came
to offer, they accepted of nothing but Corn
in Exchange for Silver.</p>
            <p>But notwithstanding so much Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and true sense of things, there had
been no more Republick of <hi>Rome,</hi> if so
be <hi>Carthage</hi> had acted the least of those
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:44396:33"/>
things to destroy it, which <hi>Rome</hi> did for
her security.</p>
            <p>Whilst Thanks were rendred to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul
that had fled, for not having despair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of the Common-wealth, Victorious
<hi>Hannibal</hi> was accused at <hi>Carthage. Hanno</hi>
could not pardon him the Advantages of
a War, which he had dissuaded; and
more Jealous of the Honour of his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
than the good of the State, more an
Enemy to the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> General, than
the <hi>Romans,</hi> he forgot nothing that might
obstruct the Successes that might be gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or destroy those already obtained.
<hi>Hanno</hi> had been taken for an Ally of the
<hi>Roman</hi> people, who regarded <hi>Hannibal</hi> as
the common Enemy. When the last sent
to demand Men and Money to maintain
the Army, <hi>What would he demand said</hi> Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,
<hi>if he had lost the Battel? No, no, My
Lords, either 'tis an Impostor, that amuses
us by false News, or a Publick Thief, that
appropriates to himself the Spoils of the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
<hi>and the advantages of the War.</hi>
These Oppositions troubled at least the
Succours, when they could not hinder
their resolution. They executed slowly
what had been resolved with pain. The
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:44396:34"/>
Recruits at length prepared, remain'd a
long time before their departure; if he
were upon a March, Orders were sent
to make him halt in <hi>Spain,</hi> instead of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
him to pass into <hi>Italy.</hi> They
arrived then very late, and when they
came to join <hi>Hannibal,</hi> which was mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous,
<hi>Hannibal</hi> received them infirm,
ruined, and out of season.</p>
            <p>This General was almost continually
destitute of Money and Provisions, red<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

to the Necessity of being Eternally
Successful in War; no Recruit at the first
Ill Fortune, and much Confusion in good

            <p>To keep so many different people in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
he added to his natural Severity an
Artificial Cruelty; which made him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable
to some, whilst his Vertue gave
him Veneration from others. To acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Truth, he used no great Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
in it to his Temper, but being na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
a little Cruel, he found himself
in such a Condition, that was necessary
for him to be so; Yet his Interests some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:44396:34"/>
diverted his Cruelty, and afforded
him the use of Mercy; for he knew how
to be pleasant and tractable for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit

            <p>When I consider that <hi>Hannibal</hi> departed

him well secured, that he cross<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>When I consider, that he posses<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed in <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
neither Places, Magazines, nor any
certain Assistance, or hopes of Retreat, I
am astonished at the boldness of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign.
But when I consider his Valour,
and his Conduct, I admire none but <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal,</hi>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:44396:35"/>
and esteem him yet beyond the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> particularly admire the War
of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> both for the reputation of
<hi>Caesar,</hi> and because, it being done in their
Countrey, it affects them with a more
lively Idea, than other people. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
to judge thereof with exactness,
it doth not approach to <hi>Hannibal's</hi> Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in <hi>Italy.</hi> Had <hi>Caesar</hi> found amongst
the <hi>Gauls,</hi> the Union and Bravery, which
the other did amongst the <hi>Romans,</hi> he
had obtained over them but small Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests;
for it is to be acknowledged,
that <hi>Hannibal</hi> met with very strange dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties,
without reckoning those he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
with him. The only advantage on
which he could reasonably depend, was
the goodness of his Troops, and his own
Personal Courage.</p>
            <p>It is certain, that the <hi>Romans</hi> had a
great Superiority over the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> in
the <hi>Sicilian</hi> War; but the Peace having
made them disband their Army, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibly
lost their Vigour, whilst their
Adversaries, employed in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Affrick,</hi>
made a practice of their Valour, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
Experience.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:44396:35"/>It was then with an old Body, that
<hi>Hannibal</hi> came to attack <hi>Italy;</hi> and with
an old Reputation, more than old Troops,
the <hi>Romans</hi> found themselves obliged to
defend it.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Roman</hi> Generals, they were
persons of a great Courage, who thought
to have injured the Glory of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
if they had not given Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
upon the first offer of the Enemy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hannibal</hi> made it his particular Study
to know their Genius's, and observed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
so much, as the humour and conduct
of each Consul, that opposed him. It was
by provoking the Fiery Temper of <hi>Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pronius,</hi>
that he knew how to draw him
to Fight, and gain the Battel of <hi>Trebia:</hi>
The Defeat of <hi>Thrasimene</hi> is owing to a
like Stratagem.</p>
            <p>Knowing the haughty Spirit of <hi>Flami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>
be burned before his Eyes, the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages
of his Allies, and incited so oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunely,
his natural Temerity, that the
Consul not only took a resolution to
Fight, at an unseasonable time, but he
ungaged him in certain Straits, where he
unhappily lost his Army, together with
his Life. As <hi>Fabius</hi> had a contrary me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:44396:36"/>
of acting, so the conduct of <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>
was different.</p>

People created a Dictator, and a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral

Fabius,</hi> a Man wise and slow, who
placed the only hope of Safety in Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
from whence might proceed Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
In the posture things were in, he
thought there was no difference between
Fighting, and losing the Battel; insomuch
that he aimed at nothing, but to
secure the Army, and omitting the hope
of Conquest, he thought to act Prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enough by preventing his being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:44396:36"/>
               <hi>Hannibal</hi> foon apprehended these diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
humours, by the report that was
made him, and his own Observations;
for he offered Battel to <hi>Fabius,</hi> many days
successively, who was so far from accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it, that he would not permit a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
man to stir out of his Camp.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Minutius</hi> on the contrary, took the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial
Bravado's of the Enemy, for so
many Affronts, and made the Dictator
pass for a weak Man, or at least insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of the disgrace of the <hi>Romans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hannibal</hi> advertised of this Discourse,
endeavoured to augment the opinion of
Fear and Weakness, which was attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to <hi>Fabius.</hi> He burnt in his view, the
most delightful Countrey of <hi>Italy,</hi> to draw
him to the Fight, which he could not do;
or at least to disparage him, in which he
did not want for Success. He made it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
suspected, that there was Intelligence
between them, preserving his Lands with
great Care, in the general Desolation of
the Countrey.</p>
            <p>This is but one part of his Contrivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
Whilst he laboured to ruine the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of <hi>Fabius,</hi> which gave him some
disquiet, he forgot nothing, to encrease
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:44396:37"/>
that of <hi>Minutius,</hi> in whom he wished the
Command, or at least, a great power in
the Army; sometimes he made a seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to observe him, when he shewed all
manner of Contempt for the other: Some
time after, being engaged in a small Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
with him, he retired first, and let
him take a small Advantage, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd
his Credit with the <hi>Romans;</hi> and
he prepared him to fall by an inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Considence: At length he knew how
to employ so much Artifice, as to cry
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> down the Dictator, and to make the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
of the Horse esteemed; insomuch
that the Command was divided, and the
Troops shared, which was never done
before. You would say, that <hi>Rome</hi> act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Spirit of her Enemy; for in
Truth so extraordinary a Decree, was
the pure effect of his Contrivance and
Design.</p>
            <p>Then was the Vanity of <hi>Minutius</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
bounds, he contemned with an equal
Imprudence, <hi>Fabius</hi> and <hi>Hannibal,</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
nothing less, <hi>Than that he alone, would
expell all Foreigners from</hi> Italy.</p>
            <p>He would have a separate Camp, of
which <hi>Hannibal</hi> was no sooner sensible,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:44396:37"/>
but he approached with his; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
amusing my self, by describing the
particulars of all actions, <hi>Minutius</hi> enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in a Fight, where he was defeated.</p>
            <p>This was the behaviour of <hi>Hannibal,</hi>
during the Dictatorship of <hi>Fabius,</hi> and his
Conduct was much after the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
towards the Consuls that gave the
Battel of <hi>Cannae;</hi> it is true, that there was
no need of so delicate a Conduct. The
Wisdom of <hi>Paulus,</hi> was less injurious to
him than that of <hi>Fabius;</hi> and the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous
Ignorance of <hi>Terentius,</hi> hurl'd
him head-long to his own ruine.</p>
            <p>One will admire perhaps, that I extend
my self so far upon an affair, which ends
at the simple defeat of <hi>Minutius,</hi> and that
I do but just mention that great and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Battel of <hi>Cannae:</hi> But I rather aim
at making known the Genius's, than to
describe the Battels. And as Ingenious
Men, are better pleas'd by considering
<hi>Caesar</hi> in the War of <hi>Petreius</hi> and <hi>Afrani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
than in Actions of his, which make
the greatest shew: I have imagined, that
one ought to consider <hi>Hannibal</hi> more cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously,
in an affair of entire Conduct,
than that great and fortunate Success,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:44396:38"/>
which the imprudence of <hi>Terentius</hi> gave
him without much difficulty.</p>
            <p>It is to be confessed notwithstanding,
that never was Battel so entirely won<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
and that very day, that I may so speak,
had been the <hi>Romans</hi> last, if <hi>Hannibal</hi> had
not chose rather to enjoy the Pleasures
of the Victory, than to pursue the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
thereof.</p>
            <p>He that made others guilty of so many
mistakes, is here sensible of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Human Nature, and cannot hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
himself from failing: He shewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
Invincible in the greatest Difficulties,

               </gap>se, when a little Action, would fix him
in a state of Repose all his life.</p>
            <p>If you enquire the reason of it; 'tis
that every thing hath Bounds in Man, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
Courage, Resolution is worn out

            <p>
               <hi>Hannibal</hi> could endure no more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he had endured too much, and his
consummated Vertue finds it sel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> without
assistance in the midst of Victory.</p>
            <p>The remembrance of past difficulties,
gave him a prospect of new ones; his
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:44396:38"/>
Spirit, which ought to have been full of
Confidence, and almost Assurance, turns
it self to a fear of the Future: He consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
when he should be bold; he Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sults,
when he should be Active; he gives
reasons for the <hi>Romans,</hi> when he ought
to have put his own in Execution.</p>
            <p>As the Faults of great Men have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
apparent Subjects, so <hi>Hannibal</hi> did
not cease to represent to himself very spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Reasons.</p>
            <p>That his Army, Invincible in the Field,
was by no means fit for Sieges; his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry
not good, no Engines, no Money, no
certain Subsistence: That by the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
he had Attacked <hi>Spolete</hi> to no purpose,
after the success of <hi>Trasimene,</hi> as Victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
as he was; that a little before the
Battel of <hi>Cannae,</hi> he had been constrained
to raise the Siege of a Town, without
Name or Forces; that to Besiege <hi>Rome,</hi>
furnished with all things, was to loose
the Reputation he went to gain, and to
destroy an Army, which alone made him
to be considered; that he ought to let the
<hi>Romans,</hi> shut up within their Walls, fall
insensibly of themselves; and in the mean
time to go and establish himself near the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:44396:39"/>
Sea, where he might receive Recruits
from <hi>Carthage</hi> with conveniency, and
where it would be easy to settle the most
considerable power of <hi>Italy.</hi> Behold the
Reasons, which <hi>Hannibal</hi> accommodated
to the disposition he found himself in, and
which he had not tasted in his first heats.</p>
            <p>In vain did <hi>Maharbal</hi> promise him to
Sup in the Capitol, his Reflections, which
had nothing but the Air of Wisdom, and
a false Reason, made him reject, as unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised,
a confidence so well established.
He had pursued Violent Counsels, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
a War with the <hi>Romans,</hi> and he is kept
back by a false Circumspection, when
he finds a time to make an end of all.</p>
            <p>It is certain, that Spirits too delicate,
such as <hi>Hannibals</hi> was, make difficulties
in Undertakings, and stop themselves by
the Obstacles, which proceed more from
Imagination, than the thing it self.</p>
            <p>There is one point in the declining of
States, where their ruine would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable,
if so be one knew the easiness
of d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>stroying them; but for want of a
Sight pure enough, or a sufficient Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
we are content with a little, when
we might do more, making either the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:44396:39"/>
meanness of Spirit, or the want of Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in the Soul, pass for Prudence. In
these conjunctures, a Man is not the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
of his own Security, an old re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
maintains you in the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of your Enemies, when the real For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
abandon you.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Hannibal</hi> puts in his view, a
power which is no more: He entertains
an Idea of dead Soldiers, and dissipated
Legions, as if he were to Fight and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat,
what he has already defeated.</p>
            <p>And certainly the Confusion had not
been less at <hi>Rome</hi> after the Battel of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae,</hi>
than it was heretofore after that of
<hi>Allia;</hi> but instead of approaching a City
where he had carried a Consternation,
he removed at a distance from it, as if he
had a mind to hearten it, and give the
Magistrates leisure to provide for all
things at their ease: He took their part
who advised to attack the Allies, who
would have fallen with <hi>Rome,</hi> and sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themselves by her with more easiness,
than she sustained her self.</p>
            <p>Behold the first and great omission of
<hi>Hannibal,</hi> which was also the first refuge
of the <hi>Romans:</hi> The Amazement passed,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:44396:40"/>
their Courage encreased, as their Forces
grew less; and the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> lost their
Vigour, as their power encreased.</p>
            <p>If so be one would enquire the caus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of
all their misfortunes, there may be found
two Essential ones; The Carelessness of
<hi>Carthage,</hi> which let good Successes fall to
nothing, for want of Relief, whilst <hi>Rome</hi>
made use of all things to repair the bad;
and <hi>Hannibals</hi> inconsiderate desire, to put
an end to his Labours, before he had ended
the War.</p>
            <p>After having tasted Repose, he was not
long before he was inclined to taste de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
and he was the more easily charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
therewith, inasmuch as they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
unknown to him.</p>
            <p>A Man that knows how to mingle
Pleasures with Business, is never posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of them; he quits them, and re takes
them at his Pleasure; and in the habit,
which he has made of them, he rather
finds a weariness of Spirit, than a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Charm that might corrupt him.</p>
            <p>It is not so with these Austere per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ons,
who by an Alteration of Temper come
to taste of Voluptuousness, they are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
enchanted with its sweetness,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:44396:40"/>
and have nothing but an aversion for the
Austerity of their past life, Nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in them wearied with Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
and Pains, abandons it self to the
first delights it meets with: Then what
had appeared Vertuous, presents it self
with a rude and difficult Air; and the
Soul, which imagines it self to be unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
of an old Error, pleases it self with
its new affection for things agreeable.</p>
            <p>'Tis this that properly arrived to <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
and his Army, which did not cease
to imitate him in Remissness, when it had
done it so well in Fatigues.</p>
            <p>There was nothing then but Baths, Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stivals,
Inclinations and Passions; there
was no more Discipline, neither by him
that ought to have given Orders, nor in
those that should have put them in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.
When he was to go into the
Field, Glory and Interest excited <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,</hi>
who took again his former Vigou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>,
and found himself, but he found no more
the same Army; there was nothing else
but softness and carelessness; if they were
to endure the least necessity, they bewail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the abundance of <hi>Capua.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They thought upon Mistresses, when
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:44396:41"/>
they were to meet the Enemy; they lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
with the tenderness of Love,
when there was need of action and fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for Battel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hannibal</hi> forgot nothing that might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
their Courage, sometimes by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of a Valour which they had
lost, sometimes by the shame of Reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
which they were insensible of.</p>
            <p>In the mean while the <hi>Roman</hi> Generals
became every day more expert. The
Legions had an advantage over corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Troops; and there arrived from <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi>
no assistance which might encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
so languishing an Army. But the
more resolution <hi>Hannibal</hi> found amongst
the Enemies, the less Service he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from his own, and the more
he took upon himself. It is not credible
with what Valour he maintain'd himself
in <hi>Italy,</hi> from whence the <hi>Romans</hi> did not
make him depart, but by obliging the
<hi>Carthaginians</hi> to recall him: These being
defeated and chased from <hi>Spain,</hi> beaten
and undone in <hi>Affrick,</hi> had recourse to
their <hi>Hannibal</hi> for their last refuge. He
obeyed the Orders of his Countrey with
the same submission, that the least Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:44396:41"/>
could have done: And he was no
sooner Arrived, but he found affairs in a
desperate posture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Scipio,</hi> who had seen the Calamities of
his Republick under unfortunate Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
commanded then the Army, in the
Prosperity which he had brought.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Hannibal,</hi> he had nothing but
the memory of his good Fortune, which
he had ill used; but he was not in the
least wanting to support the bad. The
first naturally assured, and by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
happiness of his affairs, was at the
head of an Army, which doubted not of
Victory; the second encreas'd his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
distrust by the miserable condition <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e
saw his Countrey in, and by the ill opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he conceived of his Souldiers.</p>
            <p>These different scituations of Spirit,
made Peace to be offered, and rejected;
after which, every ones Thoughts were
upon Battel.</p>
            <p>The day that it was given, <hi>Hannibal</hi>
surpassed himself, whether by taking his
Advantages, disposing his Army, or gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Orders in the Fight; but at length
the <hi>Genius</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> carried it from that of
<hi>Carthage,</hi> and the defeat of the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

yielded the Empire for ever to the
<hi>Romans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the General, he was admired by
<hi>Scipio,</hi> who in the midst of his Glory, seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to envy the Capacity of the Conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and the Conquered, whose humour
was remote enough from vain Oftentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
thought always to have some Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority
in the Science of War: For dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing
one day with <hi>Scipio</hi> of the Great
Captains, he put <hi>Alexander</hi> first, <hi>Pyrrhus</hi>
second, and himself the third; to which
<hi>Scipio</hi> coldly answered, <hi>if you had Conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me,</hi> said he, <hi>in what rank would you have
placed your self?</hi> The first of all, replied
<hi>Hannibal.</hi> 'Tis certain, that he had an
admirable Capacity in War, and those Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious
Conquerors, who have left so
great a Name to Posterity, came not near
his Industry, both in bringing together,
and maintaining Armys.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> pass'd into <hi>Asia</hi> with <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
that would obey their King; if he
had but little Money and Provisions, the
Battels which he obtain'd, put him in the
abundance of all things: A City taken or
surrendred, afforded him the Treasures
of <hi>Darius,</hi> who became necessitous in his
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:44396:42"/>
own Countrey, as <hi>Alexander</hi> possessed the
Riches thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Scipio,</hi> whom I was speaking of, made
War in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Affrick,</hi> with Legions
which the Republick had levi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caesar</hi> had the same Conveniencies for
the Conquest of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> and made use of
the Forces and Money of the Common-wealth,
even to bring them in Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>As for our <hi>Hannibal,</hi> he joined to a little
body of <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> several Nations,
which he knew how to link together by
himself; and by whom he could make
himself be obeyed in a continual neces<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ity
of Provisions and Money. That which is
yet more extraordinary, Victories made
him not the easier, he was almost as much
straitned after the gaining of them, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>But if he had Talents which the others
had not, so was he guilty of a fault, which
in probability they would not have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> was so far from leaving things
imperfect, that he always went beyond,
when they were compleated.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:44396:43"/>He was not satisfied with subduing the
great Empire of <hi>Darius,</hi> even to the least
Province; his Ambition carried him to
the <hi>Indies,</hi> when he might have united
his Glory and Repose, (which is extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary)
and have had a peaceable enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his Conquests.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Scipio</hi> did not think of ease before he had
reduced <hi>Carthage,</hi> and established in <hi>Affrick</hi>
the affairs of the <hi>Romans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And one of the great Commendations
which is given to <hi>Caesar,</hi> is, <hi>That he thought
nothing was done, while there remained any
thing to do.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>

               </bibl> Nil actum reputans, si quid superesset

            <p>When I think upon the fault of <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,</hi>
it comes presently into my mind, that
the importance of a good resolution in
great affairs is not enough considered.</p>
            <p>To go to <hi>Rome</hi> after the Battel of <hi>Cannae,</hi>
makes the destruction of this City, and
the grandeur of <hi>Carthage;</hi> not to go, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
with time the ruine of the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians,</hi>
and the Empire of the <hi>Romans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have seen a resolution taken which
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:44396:43"/>
would have occasioned the loss of a great
State, if so be it had been pursued. I have
seen a contrary taken the same day, by a
happy Change, which was its security:
but it gave less reputation to the Author
of so good advice, than the defeat of Five
Hundred Horse, or the taking an inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
City would have done.</p>
            <p>These last events strike the eyes or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
of all the World: Judgment is
hardly admired by any, because 'tis known
but by the reflections which few people
know how to make. Let us return to our
<hi>Hannibal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the Trade of War, for all the shew
it makes, merited only Consideration, I
don't see one amongst the Ancients, which
might reasonably be preferred before him:
but he that knows it best, is not necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
the greatest Man.</p>
            <p>The Beauty of Genius, Greatness of Soul,
Magnanimity, the being disinteressed, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
a Capacity universally extensive,
make the better part of the Merit of these
Great Men.</p>
            <p>To know simply how to Slaughter Men,
to be more understood than others in root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out Society, and destroying Nature,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:44396:44"/>
is to excell in a very fatal Science.</p>
            <p>The application of this Science ought
to be Just, or at least Honourable; it should
turn to the good of those whom it has
subdued, if possible; always to the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
of ones Countrey, or the necessity of
a private advantage. When it becomes
the employment of Fancy, it serves for Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularity
and Fury; when its end is to
prejudice all the World, then that Glory
which is ascribed to it, ought to be taken
away, and it render'd as Shameful, as it is
Unjust.</p>
            <p>But it is certain, That <hi>Hannibal</hi> had but
few Vertues, and many Vices; Infidelity,
Covetousness, a Cruelty oftentimes neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
always natural. However, people
judge for the most part by the Success,
whatsoever is the opinion of the wiser
sort; allowing we had all the good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
that is possible, if so be the event is
not successful, ill Fortune is instead of a
Fault, and is justified but with a very few
persons.</p>
            <p>So that <hi>Hannibal</hi> has made War better
than the <hi>Romans;</hi> that these are become
Victorious by the good Order of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick,
and that he was undone by the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:44396:44"/>
ill Government of his own; this is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of a few persons.</p>
            <p>That he was defeated by <hi>Scipio,</hi> and
that the ruine of <hi>Carthage</hi> was the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of his defeat, is a thing fully
known, from whence is framed the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Opinion of all Men.</p>

            <head type="sub">Upon the end of the Second War
of Carthage.</head>
            <p>UPON the end of so great and so long
a War, there was formed a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
particular Spirit unknown till then
in the Common-Wealth.</p>
            <p>Not but that there was often Seditions,
The Senate was more than once inclined
to the Oppression of the People, and the
People was inclined to much Violence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Senate. But men had acted in
these Occasions by a publick Sentiment,
regarding the power of one as a Tyranny
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:44396:45"/>
which ruined Freedom, and the Liberty of
t'other as an irregularity which confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all things. Here men begin to respect
themselves less in Publick than in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular;
the Bonds of Society, which had
been found so agreeable, seemed then to
be troublesom Chains, and every one out
of conceit with the Laws, had a mind to
re-enter into the first right of disposing
himself, to go to his own choice, and to
follow in this choice by the Light of his
own Spirit, the motions of his Will.</p>
            <p>As the disgust of Subjection had been
the occasion of casting out the Kings, and
dispose the People to the establishment of
Liberty, so the disgust of this same Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
which had been found troublesom to
sustain, disposed the Spirits to particular
Passions.</p>
            <p>The Love of the Countrey, the Zeal of
the Publick good were exhausted in the
midst of the War against <hi>Hannibal,</hi> where
the affection and vertue of the Citizens
had been beyond the expectation of the
Republick. Men had given their Estates
and Blood for the Publick, which was not
yet in a State to give any Comfort to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:44396:45"/>The hardness even of the Senate had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd
that of the Laws in some occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and the rigour which had been used
to the Prisoners of the Battel of <hi>Cannae,</hi> had
touched the whole World: but people had
sussered patiently, at a time when they
thought to have endured all things by a
common Interest. So soon as they had
less to Fear, they thought the necessity of
Suffering was at an end, and every one
having lost their being tractable and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
before the conclusion of their mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes,
they supported with Pain, what
they imagined to endure without necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
by the sole pleasure of the Magistrates.</p>
            <p>'Twas thus properly that the first dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gusts
were framed, from whence it came
to pass, that Men return'd from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick
to themselves, sought new engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in Society, and preferr'd amongst
themselves the choice of Subjects, which
deserved their affections.</p>
            <p>In this Disposition of Minds, <hi>Scipio</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
himself to the <hi>Romans,</hi> with all the
Qualities that might acquire the Esteem
and Favour of Men.</p>
            <p>He was of a Great Birth, and in him
was equally discern'd Goodness, and the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:44396:46"/>
Beauty of an excellent Nature. He had
an admirable greatness of Courage; a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
sweet and bountiful; a Spirit earnest
in Publick to inspire his Resolution and
Confidence, polite and agreeable in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
conversations, for the Pleasure of
Friendship most refined; a lofty Soul but
regulated, more sensible of Glory than
Ambitious of Power, seeking less to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
himself by Authority, or the
splendor of Fortune, than by the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of his Undertakings, and the merit of
his Actions.</p>
            <p>Add to so many things, that Happy
Successes always answered to high designs;
and to leave nothing that's desirable, he
perswaded the People, <hi>That he enterprised
nothing without Advice, and never acted
without the Assistance of the Gods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not strange, that such a Man as I
describe, should draw to him inclinations
which they had a mind to give, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engage
Spirits from a Republick, which
they had already some disgust for: So that
the Will of a Person so Vertuous, was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
before Laws, which perhaps were
not so equitable.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Scipio,</hi> he used all sorts of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:44396:46"/>
and Courtesy; and quitting the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Severity of Discipline, he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Troops with Sweetness, that obeyed
with Affection.</p>
            <p>Besides, never had a <hi>Roman</hi> General so
much Capacity, nor so well managed; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
were Legions so desirous to do well;
never was Common-wealth so well ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
but by a different Spirit from that of
the Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>abius</hi> and <hi>Cato</hi> were sensible of this
evil, and forgot nothing that might admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
a Remedy. In truth, they mixed
therewith the sowrness of their Passions;
and the envy they bore to this Great Man,
had as great a share in their oppositions,
as the Jealousy of Liberty. That which
is extraordinary, is, that the Corruptor
remained a person of Credit amongst those
whom he Corrupted, and acted more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
than those who opposed the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Indeed he made all things subservient
to the Common-wealth, from which he
took others off, and had no Crime but
serving it with the same qualities, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he might have ruined it.</p>
            <p>I acknowledge, That in the Maximes of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:44396:47"/>
so Jealous a Government, some Alarm
might be reasonably taken.</p>
            <p>A Soul so elevated, is thought incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of Moderation; a desire of Glory so
passionate, hardly distinguisheth it self
from Ambition, which aspires to Power.
A confidence so uncommon, is not remote
from undertakings so extraordinary. In
a word, the Vertues of Heroes are suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
in Citizens; I dare even affirm, that
this Opinion of Commerce with the Gods,
so advantagious to Legislators for the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of States, seemed of a perilous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
in a private person for an esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Scipio</hi> then was unfortunate, in giving
appearances contrary to his intentions:
which served as a pretence for the malice
of his Rivals, as a ground for the cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of alarmed persons.</p>
            <p>Behold immediately a Man of Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
suspected, and a little after an Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
accused: He could answer and justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
himself; but there is an Heroick Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
as well as a Courage, if one may be
allowed to say so: he neglected those
forms, where the ordinary Innocents are
subjected, instead of answering his Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers;
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:44396:47"/>
and he render'd the Gods Thanks for
his Victories, when they demanded of
him an Account of his Actions. All the
People followed him to the Capitol, to
the shame of those that prosecuted him.
And to justify better the sincerity of his
Designs, and the pureness of his Vertue,
he gave up his resentments to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
choosing rather to live at a distance
from <hi>Rome,</hi> through the ingratitude of
some Citizens, than to render himself
the Master of it through the injustice of
an Usurpation. So many Noble Qualities
have obliged <hi>Livy</hi> to make his Heroe of
so great a Man, and to give him a curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
preference over the rest of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If there have been those that have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
more Battels, and taken a greater
number of Cities, they have not defeated
<hi>Hannibal,</hi> nor reduced <hi>Carthage:</hi> if they
have known how to command others as
well as he, they have not known how to
Command themselves, and to enjoy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
equally in the hurry of Business, and
the Repose of a Private Life.</p>
            <p>I will not dispute whether he was the
Greatest, but if I dare affirm what <hi>Livy</hi>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:44396:48"/>
hath but insinuated, to take him all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
he was the most deserving Person.
He had the Vertue of the Ancient <hi>Romans,</hi>
but cultivated and polished; he had the
knowledge and capacity of the last, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any mixture of Corruption. It is to
be acknowledged notwithstanding, that
his Actions were more advantagious to
the Common-wealth, than his Vertues.
The <hi>Roman</hi> People had too deep a taste
of his Vertues, and disengaged themselves
from the Obligations of their Duty, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the engagements of their Will.</p>
            <p>The Humanity of <hi>Scipio,</hi> did not cease
to produce unhappy effects with time. It
taught the Generals how to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
beloved, and as things always de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate,
an agreeable command was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by an unworthy complaisance; and
when Vertues wanted to gain esteem and
friendship, they employed all the means
that might corrupt. See the miserable
effects of this particular Spirit, Noble and
Glorious in its beginning, but which since
produced the Ambitious and the Covetous,
the Corrupters and the Corrupted.</p>
            <p>This first disrelishing of the Republick,
had notwithstanding so much of Hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:44396:48"/>
that people disengaged themselves
from the Love of the Laws, on purpose to
settle their affections on Vertuous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> came to consider their
Laws, as the sentiments of the old Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slators,
who ought not to Rule their Age;
and those of <hi>Scipio</hi> were lookt upon as li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
and animated Laws.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Scipio,</hi> he turned to the Service
of the Publick, all that consideration
which they had for his Person; but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
to sweeten the austerity of Duty by
the Charm of Glory, he was perhaps a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
more sensible therein than he ought,
and at <hi>Rome</hi> particularly, where all the
Citizens appeared Criminals, when they
attracted too favourable an esteem.</p>
            <p>This new Genius which succeeded to
the Publick Good, encouraged the <hi>Romans</hi>
long enough to great things, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
dispos'd themselves thereto with some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of Life and Industry, which they
had not before: for the Love of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
makes us abandon our Fortune, and
even our Lives for its Security; but the
ambition and desire of Glory much more
excite our Industry, than this first Passion
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:44396:49"/>
always delicate and noble, but rarely cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and ingenious.</p>
            <p>'Tis to this Genius that is owing the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat
of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and the ruine of <hi>Carthage,</hi>
the fall of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and the Conquest or
subjection of all the <hi>Greeks:</hi> from whence
one may say with reason, that it was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s
to the Common-wealth for its
Grandeur, but prejudicial for its Liberty.</p>
            <p>At length they were as much out of
humour with that, as they were with the
love of the Republick; that esteem, that
inclination so Noble for Men of Vertue,
seemed ridiculous to those that would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
nothing but themselves. Honour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to pass for a Chimera, Glory for a
meer Vanity, and every one rendred him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
basely Interessed, imagining to become
judiciously solid.</p>
            <p>But the Genius of Interest, which took
place to that of Honour, acted differently
amongst the <hi>Romans,</hi> according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
of Tempers.</p>
            <p>Those that possessed any thing of Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
would acquire Power; Inferiour Souls
contented themselves by heaping up Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
all manner of ways.</p>
            <p>As they did not fall quite of a sudden to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:44396:49"/>
an entire corruption, so there was a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
from Honour to Interest, where both
one and t'other subsisted in the Republick,
but with different respects. There was
something of Honesty in some particular
things, and Infamy in others.</p>
            <p>The Tempers were corrupted in <hi>Rome,</hi>
in affairs that related to the Citizens. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity
became every day more rare; Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
was hardly known any more, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of becoming Rich the predominant
Passion, and the considerable per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ons ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
their Industry in appropriating to
themselves what did not belong to them.</p>
            <p>But still there was a Dignity in what
related to Strangers; and the most depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
within shewed themselves Jealous of
the Glory of the <hi>Roman</hi> Name abroad.</p>
            <p>Nothing was more unjust than the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Senators, nothing so filthy
as their Avarice; in the mean time the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
applied themselves with niceness to
the preservation of their Dignity, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
were they more careful of hindring the
Majesty of the <hi>Roman</hi> People from being
violated.</p>
            <p>This Senate, in other things so much gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to Interest, and so corrupted with their
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:44396:50"/>
Citizens, had as elevated Thoughts, as <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio</hi>
could have, when they were concerned
with Enemies. In the time of a great cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
they could not dispence with the
shameful Treaty of <hi>Mancinus</hi> with the <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantines;</hi>
and this miserable Consul was
obliged to go and deliver up himself into
their hands, with all manner of Disgrace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gracchus,</hi> who had some share in the
Peace, being Quaestour in the Army of
<hi>Mancinus,</hi> made a useless endeavour to
sustain it; his Credit was of no Service,
and his Eloquence was vainly employed.
As there has happened through <hi>Gracchus,</hi>
one of the most important affairs of the
Common-wealth, and perhaps the rise
of all those that have since disturbed it,
it will not be amiss to describe him to
you.</p>
            <p>He was a person very considerable by
his Authority, by the Advantages of his
Body, and the Qualities of his Mind; of a
Genius opposite to that of the Great <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio,</hi>
from whom his Mother <hi>Cornelia</hi> came;
more Ambitious of Power, than Animated
through a desire of Glory, unless it were
that of Eloquence, necessary at <hi>Rome</hi> to
get a Reputation. He had a great and lofty
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:44396:50"/>
Soul; more fit notwithstanding to embrace
Novelties, and to recall past affairs, than
solidly to pursue those established. His In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity
could not suffer any Interest of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
for himself: it is true that he did not
procure that of others, without mingling
therein the consideration of some design;
yet the Love of good things was natural
enough to him, the hatred of bad ones
yet more. He had a Compassion for the
Oppressed, more Animosity against the
Oppressors: insomuch that his Passion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
over his Vertue, he insensibly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horr'd
the Persons, more than the Crimes.</p>
            <p>Several great Qualities made him admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
amongst the <hi>Romans:</hi> he had not one
in that exactness where it ought to have
been. His Engagements carried him far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than he thought, his Firmness turn'd
into something of obstinate; and those
Vertues which might have been useful to
the Republick, became so many advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Talents for Factions.</p>
            <p>I see neither curiousness nor moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the Judgments, that have been left of
him.</p>
            <p>Those that have held the Party of the
Senate, have made him pass for a Furious
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:44396:51"/>
person; the Partisans of the People, for a
true Protector of Liberty. It seems to me
that he aimed at goodness, and that he na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
hated all manner of Injustice; but
opposition put these good motions in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order:
A thing contested, incensing him
against those that made resistance, made
him pursue by his Spirit of Faction, what
he had begun by a Sentiment of Vertue.</p>
            <p>Behold, in my Opinion, what was the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
of <hi>Gracchus,</hi> who stirr'd up the People
against the Senate. Its necessary to see
what disposition the People was in.</p>
            <p>After having rendred great Services to
the State, the People found themselves ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to the Oppression of the Rich, and
particularly to that of the Senators, who
by Authority, or other wicked methods,
robb'd the Commons of their small Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.
Continual Injuries then had aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Spirits of the Multitude, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
conceiving, as yet, any Ill intentions;
they suffered with Grief a Tyranny, and
more Miserable, than Seditious, they expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
more than they sought after, a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
from an unfortunate Condition.</p>
            <p>I thought it necessary, to describe the
Senate, <hi>Gracchus,</hi> and the People, before I
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:44396:51"/>
entred into that violent agitation, which
the Common-wealth was sensible of.</p>
            <p>One will conceive then the Senate unjust,
corrupted, but concealing the Infamys with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
by some Dignity to the affairs abroad:
One will have the Idea of <hi>Gracchus,</hi> as a
person that had great Talents, but fitter
to ruine altogether a corrupted Common-wealth,
than to re-establish it in its pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
by a wise Reformation. As for the
People, they were not disaffected, but
they could not tell how to live in their
Misery, nor how to employ themselves
after the loss of their Possessions.</p>

            <head type="sub">Of Augustus, his Government,
and his Genius.</head>
            <p>I Will not treat of the Beginnings of the
Life of <hi>Augustus,</hi> they were too Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical:
I pretend to consider him since his
Arrival to the Empire. And in my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:44396:52"/>
never did Government deserve more
particular observations, than his.</p>
            <p>After the Tyranny of the <hi>Triumvirate,</hi>
and the Desolation that the Civil War oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned,
he had a mind at length to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
by Reason, a People subjected by
Force, and disgusted by a Violence, which
perhaps the Necessity of things had obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
him to: He knew how to establish a
happy subjection, farther distant from Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
than the ancient Liberty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Augustus</hi> was not one of those, who fixt
the Beauty of Command, in the Rigour of
Obedience; who reap no Pleasure from
the Service which is done them, but by
the Necessity which they impose for it.</p>
            <p>This fineness of Government hath been
a point of Nicety under some of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours,
that Subjects were not permitted
to seem willing to bear that, which they
were willing to impose on them. A Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
that was received without Pain, a
Banishment whereto one agreed with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility,
a Submission easy in every thing,
caused the disgust of the Prince; to Obey
at his Pleasure, it was necessary to Obey in
spight of himself; but it was also requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to be very exact, when they seem'd
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:44396:52"/>
dissatisfied; for he that did so, and made
a shew of it, excited Malice and Anger,
so that the poor <hi>Romans</hi> knew not where
to find a Medium too nice, between two
dangerous things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Augustus</hi> had a contrary Judgment; he
supposed that to dispose Men with ease, it
was proper to gain their Minds, before he
exacted Duties; and he was so successful
in perswading them of the usefulness of
his Orders, that they thought less upon the
Obligation they were under to follow
them, than upon the advantage, that they
found therein. One of the greatest Cares
that he ever had, was to make the <hi>Romans</hi>
taste the Happiness of Government, and
to make the Power, as far as he could, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible
to them. He rejected the very
Names that he thought might be displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
and above all things the quality of
Dictator, detested in <hi>Scylla,</hi> and even odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in <hi>Caesar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The most part of those that raise them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
up, take new Titles to Authorize a
new Power; he was for hiding a new
Power under usual Names, and ordinary
Dignities.</p>
            <p>He made himself called Emperour, from
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:44396:53"/>
time to time, to preserve his Authority
over the Legions; he made himself to be
created Tribune, to manage the People;
Prince of the Senate, to govern them; but
when he re-united in his person, so many
different Powers, he also charged himself
with divers Cares; and he really became
the Servant of the Armies, People, and
Senate, when he rendred himself Master
thereof: yet he made use of his Power, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to take away the Confusion, that was
slipt into all things. He re-united the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in their Rights, and retrenched nothing
but Factions at the Election of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates:
He restored to the Senate their
Ancient Splendour, after having banished
Corruption; for he contented himself with
a moderate Power, which did not afford
him the Liberty of doing ill; but would
have it absolute, when he treated of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
upon others the necessity of doing
well.</p>
            <p>So that the People were not less free,
but to be less Seditious; the Senate was
not less powerful, but upon the account of
being less unjust: Liberty lost nothing but
the misfortunes which it might occasion,
nothing of the Happiness it might produce.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:44396:53"/>After having established so good an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
he found himself agitated by different
Thoughts, and considered a long time
with himself, whether he ought to keep
the Empire, or restore the People to their
first Liberty. The examples of <hi>Scylla</hi> and
<hi>Caesar,</hi> notwithstanding their difference,
made an equal impression in favour of the
last Opinion. He considered that <hi>Scylla,</hi>
who had voluntarily quitted the Dictator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
dyed peaceably in the midst of his
Enemies: and that <hi>Caesar,</hi> for having kept
it, was Assassinated by his most intimate
Friends, who made an Ostentation of it.</p>
            <p>Struggling with so troublesom an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty,
he discovered the disorder of his
Soul to his two principal Friends, <hi>Agrippa</hi>
and <hi>Mecenas. Agrippa,</hi> who gained him
the Empire by his Valour, advised him by
moderation to lay it down; unless it were
perhaps, that he had more concealed ends:
And to shew himself a greater Warriour,
than <hi>Augustus</hi> was, he expected the chief
Employments of the Common-wealth,
when it should be re-established. As for
<hi>Mecenas</hi> who had no share in the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
he Counselled him to retain what they
had given him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:44396:54"/>It was not without making enter into
his Reasons, the consideration of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
which could not be sustained, said he,
without <hi>Augustus:</hi> But allowing it might
be so in some measure, he followed in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
his inclination for the Person of the
Prince, and his own proper Interest.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mecenas</hi> was a person of Esteem, of those
notwithstanding that are complaisant, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
more sensible of the agreements of
Life, than of those solid Vertues, which
were esteemed in the Common-wealth.
He was Ingenious, but given to his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
apprehending all things with much
clearness, and judging thereof with solidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
but more capable of advising, than act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
So that finding himself weak, una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive,
and purely for the Cabinet, he hoped
from his nicety with a Nice Emperour,
what he could not expect from the <hi>Roman</hi>
People; where he must have raised him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
by his own proper means, and acted
briskly by himself.</p>
            <p>To return from the persons to the thing,
the Empire was retained by his Advice,
and the resolution of keeping it being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
<hi>Augustus</hi> did not cease to offer to lay
it down to the Senate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:44396:54"/>Some were affected therewith as a great
moderation, many acknowledged the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Honesty of the Offer: But all truly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
in this point, to refuse the ancient
Liberty.</p>
            <p>You would have said, that there was a
contest of Civilities, which concluded in a
common Satisfaction: For <hi>Augustus</hi> gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the Empire by the Senate, and the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
did not govern it self, but by <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Government so ordered was pleasing
to all the World, and the Prince followed
no less his Interest therein, than his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
Temper; for at length one passes
with much ado from Liberty to Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and he might esteem himself happy
to command, insome fashion, a Free Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the fatal example of <hi>Caesar,</hi> had
perhaps obliged him to take different ways,
to avoid the same end.</p>
            <p>The Great <hi>Iulius</hi> Born, that I may so
speak, in a Faction opposed to the Senate,
had always a secret desire of oppressing
the same; and having found it contrary
to his Designs in the Civil War, he took a
new aversion for the Body, although he
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:44396:55"/>
had much Sweetness and Clemency for the
Senators in particular. After his return to
<hi>Rome,</hi> as he saw himself assured of the
People and the Legions, he made but a
small reckoning of the Senate, and even
treated it insolently upon some occasions;
so difficult is it in the most reserved, not
to forget themselves in a great Fortune.</p>
            <p>But it is certain that this proud Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
incensed a great many persons,
and produced, or at least advanced, the
Conspiracy that ruined him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Augustus,</hi> one of the wariest Princes of
the World, did not omit the benefit of
an observation so necessary, and scarce was
he Possessed of the Empire by the Legions,
but he thought to govern it by the Senate.</p>
            <p>He knew the Violence of the Soldiers,
and the Tumultuousness of the People,
both one and t'other appearing to him,
more fit to be employed in a present occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
than easy to be managed, when it
is over.</p>
            <p>He had a mind then to found the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
upon the Senate, as upon the
Body the best ordered, and most capable
of Wisdom and Justice; but at the same
time he assured himself of the Legions and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:44396:55"/>
the People, by Donatives and Acts of
Grace. So the whole World was content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as I have said, and <hi>Augustus</hi> found in
his moderation, the safety of his Person, and
his Power. In which, certainly he had an
extraordinary Happiness, imagining no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
so desirable in Life, as to be able ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
to pursue his Inclination and his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest.</p>
            <p>I will not excuse his Beginnings, but I
make no question, but that in the violence
of the <hi>Triumvirate,</hi> he did much Violence
to himself.</p>
            <p>'Tis certain, that he naturally hated the
cruel humour of <hi>Marius, Sylla,</hi> and such as
were like them; he hated those fierce
Souls who have but an imperfect Pleasure
in being Masters, if they don't make their
Power felt by others; who place Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in Force, and the happiness of their
Condition, in making persons miserable
at their Pleasure.</p>
            <p>He had experienc'd that an Honest Man
makes himself first unhappy, when he
makes others so; and he was never so
well satisfied, as when he saw himself in
a capacity of doing well, according to his
inclination, after having done ill against
his Mind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:44396:56"/>He always aimed at the good of affairs,
but he desired that affairs should go to the
advantage of Men, and con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>idered less in
his undertakings the Glory, than the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit.
During his Government, no War
was neglected that might be useful; and
left those for Heroes, that are purely Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</p>
            <p>This made him come to an Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
with the <hi>Parthians,</hi> and renounce
the Project which <hi>Caesar</hi> made, when he
was killed; this made him reject the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal
of a certain War in <hi>Germany,</hi> where
he discerned no real Interest; this made
him set Limits to the Empire, whatsoever
Interpretation <hi>Tacitus</hi> has given of so pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
a Design. In a word, he was little
attentive to Opinion, Noise, and Vanity.
He esteemed a solid Reputation, which
renders the Life of Men more pleasant and
secure.</p>
            <p>'Tis very true, that <hi>Augustus</hi> had but
an indifferent Talent for War; and to
commend his Wisdom and his Capacity,
one must not commend his Valour in all
things. <hi>Hirtius</hi> and <hi>Pansa</hi> carried on the
first War against <hi>Anthony,</hi> whereof <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus</hi>
alone reaped the Advantage. He
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:44396:56"/>
gained but little glory in that of <hi>Brutus,</hi>
which was managed and concluded by
<hi>Anthony.</hi> The loss of <hi>Anthony</hi> was the
effect of his Passion for <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and the
Valour of <hi>Agrippa. Augustus</hi> had but
little share in Battels, and obtained the
Empire. Not but that he was in several,
and even wounded in some: but with
more Success for his affairs, than Glory
for his person. So the Tenth Legion some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
insolent through the high esteem
that the Great <hi>Caesar</hi> had for them, could
not bear with the Nephew, every time
they remembred the Uncle; from whence
it came to pass that it was Disbanded,
notwithstanding all its Merit, for shewing
a want of Respect to him once in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.
That doth not hinder him from
making an admirable use of War for his
own Interest, and that of the Empire. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
did Prince know how to give a better
Order, nor Transport himself more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly,
wherever his affairs called him, to
<hi>Egypt,</hi> to <hi>Spain,</hi> amongst the <hi>Gauls, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
and the East.</p>
            <p>But at length it was discerned, that War
was not agreeable to his true Genius, and
although he triumphed with the applause
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:44396:57"/>
of all the World, it was well known that
his Lieutenants had Conquered.</p>
            <p>He would have passed for a great Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
in the time of those Emperours, who
by their little Valour, or a false Greatness,
durst not take, or else thought below them
the Conduct of Armys. Being come in
an Age, wherein he could not recommend
himself but by his own Exploits, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
succeeding to <hi>Caesar,</hi> who owed
all to himself, it was a disadvantage to
him to owe more to another, than himself.</p>
            <p>It was not so in the Government, where
the Senate did nothing that was Wise and
Good, but what <hi>Augustus</hi> had Inspired in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them: The Good of the State was his
first Thought, and he did not apprehend
by the good of the State, a vain and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastical
Name, but the real benefit of those
that composed it. His own first; for it is
not just to quit the Pleasures of a Private
Life, to abandon himself to the cares of
the Publick, if so be he did not find his
advantages therein: And that of others,
which he imagined could not be absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
separate from his own.</p>
            <p>Persons of the greatest Service had his
first consideration, and Merit advanced un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:44396:57"/>
him those, which it had ruined un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his Successors, where the Crimes were
less dangerous than the Vertues. <hi>Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa</hi>
had not so great a share in his Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
as <hi>Mec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nas;</hi> but his great qualities
rendred him much more considerable; and
and it being come to that point in <hi>Rome,</hi>
that <hi>Augustus</hi> found himself obliged to be
rid of him, or gain him entirely, he ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
chose to give him his Daughter, for
all the meanness of his Birth, than hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to what Jealousy might Inspire him
with. As for <hi>Mecenas,</hi> as he was more
agreeable, and more versed in the Closet,
so had he the preference in his Pleasures,
and in his Secrets.</p>
            <p>He was obliging to his Courtiers, and
was not displeas'd, that these <hi>Romans</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
so fierce and free, would take the
advantage of his Favours. So that they
studied to please <hi>Augustus,</hi> and the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the Court became a true Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest:
Yet it was not the most considerable.
The Merit which related to the State, was
preferred before that which was acquired
by an inclination for his person: Which
he established himself by his Discourses,
never speaking of what was due to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:44396:58"/>
but always what he owed himself to the
Republick.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, there is no life so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular,
where particular Actions don't
sometimes exceed the general habit and
conduct: He defended one day a Friend of
his, that was accused of a horrible Rogue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and in all appearance preserved him
by his consideration alone. It was not
without offending all persons of repute,
but yet he had so much moderation in
keeping the forms, and in suffering the
liberty of those, who answered him some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
smartly, that he regained their
minds; and even those that were scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized,
returning from their Indignation,
excused the Injustice of Protecting a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Man, by the Honesty that appeared
in not deserting a Friend.</p>
            <p>The Men of Learning had a share in
his familiarity, amongst the rest <hi>Livy,
Virgil, Horace;</hi> whereby one may see
the goodness of his Judgment, as well for
Works of Learning, as in Business. He
loved the exquisite taste of his Age,
the delicacy of which has been but little
common in all the rest. But he fear'd the
singularities which came from a false Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:44396:58"/>
and whereof the Wicked persons that
are knowing therein, make an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
merit. As he lived amongst curious
persons, so he took delight in seeing his
Laws approved, and his Opinion was, that
it is much better to fall naturally into the
good sense of others by his Reason, than to
make his Humours received by Force. I
imagined formerly, that the most delicate
Spirits of the <hi>Romans,</hi> had been in the
Reign of <hi>Augustus,</hi> but since my Writing
this small Treatise of <hi>Augustus</hi>'s Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
I have altered my Opinion.</p>
            <p>Besides the Honour of his Judgment,
which he was Jealous of, he still thought
that a Gift disapproved of, was a Favour
but to one, and a prejudice to a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
That the disgrace of an honest man
on the other side was resented by all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
men, by the compassion it gives to
some, and the allarm that it gives to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>He had an admirable Faculty in discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the humour and ambition of the most
elevated persons, yet without conceiving
Suspicions fatal to their Vertue.</p>
            <p>The Liberty of Opinions was not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing
to him upon general affairs, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeming
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:44396:59"/>
that Men have their Priviledges
therein; that it is a crime to search curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
into the Secrets of the Prince, and a
piece of Infidelity not to make a good use
of his Confidence: But that business which
was become publick, belonged in spite of
all to the Judgment of the Publick; that
he ought to represent it to himself before
he was concerned, and not to pretend to
obstruct it, when it was done.</p>
            <p>It was perhaps upon the knowledge of
his humour, that <hi>Livy</hi> durst write so bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the War of <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> without
being e're the less in his Favour. <hi>Cremuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
Cordus</hi> recited his History to him, and
he did not think himself scandalized to
see therein <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius</hi> called the
last of the <hi>Romans:</hi> An Encomium fatal to
<hi>Cremutius</hi> under <hi>Tiberius,</hi> in that he was
accused of a Crime says <hi>Tacitus,</hi> till then
unheard of, and which cost him his Life.
<hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cenas</hi> had given him an advice yet more
particular, but of a more difficult use; it
was, <hi>never to be concerned at what was spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
against him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If so be what is alledged of us be true,
added <hi>Mecenas,</hi> it is our business rather to
correct our selves, than for others to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:44396:59"/>
themselves. If so be what is said of
us be false, so soon as we shew a concern
at it, we make it suspected for Truth.
The contempt of such Discourses discredits
them, and takes away the pleasure from
those that make them. If you are more
sensible of them than you ought to be, it
is in the power of the most miserable Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
the most pitiful envious person, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb
the repose of your life, and all your
power cannot defend you from your own
Vexation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Augustus</hi> went further in certain mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and not so far by abundance in others.
I see Injuries forgotten, I see him so bold
in his Clemency, that he durst Pardon a
Conspiracy not only true, but even ready
for Execution.</p>
            <p>In the mean time for all the Vertues of
Men, they never give so much to their
Vertue, but they leave to their humour.
It is not credible how nice he was, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to his Family, nothing was so dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
as to talk of the Amours of <hi>Iulia,</hi> if
he would not be thought to have some
Interest with her: <hi>Ovid</hi> was Banished for
it, and was never recalled; and that which
appears to me extraordinary, the Husband
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:44396:60"/>
himself resented this unlucky humour.
That the Conduct of <hi>Iulia</hi> should displease
<hi>Augustus,</hi> was a natural thing, but that
the poor <hi>Agrippa</hi> should suffer the Anger
of his Father in Law, and the Debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of his Wife at the same time, is an odd
business, and the last misfortune of a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
state.</p>
            <p>It is to be confessed that the Family of
the Emperour, gave him too much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance
in the general applause of the
whole Empire. He could not resist the
little Troubles which his Family afforded
him, and he behaved himself therein more
like a Private person than a Great man,
for he knew neither how to end a misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
by a good Order, which is really no
easy thing, nor yet to pacify himself.</p>
            <p>After having been too much afflicted on
one side, he let himself go too carelessly
to the sweetness he found on t'other; and
if so be <hi>Iulia</hi> tormented him as long as
she lived, <hi>Livia</hi> knew how to possess him
so well in the declining of his Age, that
the adoption of <hi>Tiberius</hi> was rather the
effect of her Conduct, than the real choice
of the Emperour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Augustus</hi> discerned Vices better than any
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:44396:60"/>
one; the Vices of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
of <hi>Livia:</hi> but he had not the force to
act according to the Judgment he made
thereof.</p>
            <p>Whilst he saw every thing with a sound
prospect, which moved him to nothing,
his Wife left his Understanding there with
an unprofitable Knowledge, and made her
self Mistress of his Will.</p>
            <p>'Tis this which hath deceived <hi>Tacitus,</hi>
in my Judgment, in that malicious curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,
which he gives <hi>Augustus.</hi> He knew
that the nature of <hi>Tiberius</hi> was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to him; and to believe that a
Great Emperour could not be perswaded
to so important a business against his own
proper Sentiment, he hath made a Design
and a Mystery, where there was nothing,
if I am not deceived, but facility.</p>
            <p>After these particulars of his Family, let
us return to generals: He made the World
happy, and was happy in the World: He
had nothing to desire of the Publick, nor
the Publick of him: And considering the
Evils which he occasion'd to come to the
Empire, and the good he hath done since
he was Emperour, I find that it hath been
said with reason, that he should never
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:44396:61"/>
have been Born, or never have Died.</p>
            <p>He died at length regretted of all men,
less great without comparison than <hi>Caesar,</hi>
but of a more regular Spirit; which makes
me believe, that it had been more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to have been in the Army of <hi>Caesar,</hi> but
more pleasant to have lived under the
Command of <hi>Augustus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Romans,</hi> they had nothing so
elevated, as in the time of the Republick,
neither for the greatness of Genius, nor the
force of the Soul; but something more so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciable:
After all the misfortunes they had
suffered, they were glad to find some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshment,
no matter how.</p>
            <p>There was no more a sufficient Vertue
to sustain Liberty; they would have been
ashamed of an entire subjection; and with
an exception of some fierce Spirits, which
nothing could content, every one took a
Pride in the appearance of a Republick,
and was not displeas'd with the effect of
a pleasant and agreeable Government.</p>

            <p>AS there are but few Revolutions,
where one stops at terms that are
moderate, a happy and an honest State is
frequently changed into a miserable and
unworthy condition. The <hi>Roman</hi> Valour
was softned after the death of <hi>Brutus</hi> and
<hi>Cassius,</hi> who sustained the fierceness thereof.</p>
            <p>After the loss of <hi>Anthony,</hi> there was, as
it were, a general agreement for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of <hi>Augustus,</hi> and an equal complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance
for his person.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Tiberius</hi> came to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
this complaisance turned into base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and flattery.</p>
            <p>One might have said, that this Prince,
being naturally irresolute, would have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
but a moderate power; but the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
more disposed to serve, than <hi>Tiberi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
to command, gave him themselves their
Slavery, when he hardly durst hope for
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:44396:62"/>
their Subjection. See what was the Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
of the <hi>Roman</hi> People at that time.</p>
            <p>Its necessary now to speak of that <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi>
and to shew the temper he brought
with him to the Government of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</p>
            <p>His design most concealed, but best fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
was to change all the maxims of
<hi>Augustus.</hi> This, when he came to be Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
gave all his Thoughts of so just
and so prudent a conduct, to the general
Good: <hi>Tiberius</hi> made a Science of the
Closet, wherein was shut up a false and
mysterious Interest of the Prince, separate
from the Interest of the State, and almost
always opposed to the Publick Good.</p>
            <p>Judgment, Capacity, and the Secret,
were changed into Slyness, Artifice, and
Dissimulation. There was no more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Good and Evil actions by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
every thing was taken according
to the nice intention of the Emperour, or
was judged by the curiousness of some ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
Speculation.</p>
            <p>The Credit which <hi>Germanicus</hi> had to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease
the Legions, was a Service very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious,
and a little while agreeable:
When the danger was over, it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:44396:62"/>
that he could draw the Troops from
their Obedience, since he knew how to
bring them there. In vain was he faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to <hi>Tiberius,</hi> his moderation in refulsing
the Empire, made him not to be thought
Innocent; he was judged capable of what
had been offered to him; and so many
tricks were employed for his loss, that they
at length got rid of a Man that would
have Obeyed well, but deserved to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
            <p>He perished, this <hi>Germanicus</hi> so dear to
the <hi>Romans,</hi> in an Army, where he had
less reason to fear the Enemies of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
than an Emperour whom he had so
well served.</p>
            <p>He was not the only person that had a
sense of this fatal Policy, the same Spirit
reigned generally in all thins. The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
employments were mysterious exiles,
the Charges, the Governments were given
to persons that ought to have been ruined,
or else to those that should ruine others.
In a word, the benefit of good service
entred no more in any consideration; for
in truth the Armys had rather Out-laws
than Generals; and the Provinces, Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Men, than Governours. At <hi>Rome,</hi>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:44396:63"/>
where the Laws had been always so religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
observed, and with so much forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
every thing was then managed by the
jealousie of his Mysterious Cabinet.</p>
            <p>When a person of considerable Merit te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified,
some Passion for the Glory of the
Empire, <hi>Tiberius</hi> suspected immediately,
that it was with a design to obtain it.</p>
            <p>If any other had an innocent remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of Liberty, he pass'd for a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Man that had a mind to Re-establish
the Re-publick. To praise <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius,</hi>
was a morrtal Crime; to bewail <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus,</hi>
a secret Offence, which was so
much the less pardoned, as they durst not
complain; for <hi>Tiberius</hi> always commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him in Publick, and made Divine Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
be decreed to him, which he first of
all performed to him: but Humane Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were not permitted, and a Passion
testified for the Memory of this Emperour,
was taken for an Accusation to disturb the
Government, or for a disaffection for the
Person of the Prince.</p>
            <p>Hitherto you have had Crimes inspired
by the jealousie of a false Policy, now 'tis
an open Cruelty, and a declared Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:44396:63"/>One is not contented to forsake good
Maxims, one abolished the best Laws, and
made an infinite number of new ones,
which respected in an appearance the safety
of the Emperour, but in truth the loss of
the Men of Credit that remained at <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Every thing was made Treason; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
a true Conspiracy was punished,
here an innocent word maliciously explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>The Complaints, which have been left
to the Unfortunate for the support of their
Miseries, the Tears, those natural Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of our Grief, the Sighs which slip
from us in spite our Will, the simple Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards
at length became fatal. The simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of Discourse expressed evil Designs,
the discretion of Silence concealed mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
Intentions: Joy was observed as a
Hope, conceiving the Death of the Prince.
Melancholly was remarked as a Trouble for
his Prosperity, or an Envy of his Life: In
the midst of Dangers, if that of Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
gave you any motion of Fear, your
Apprehension was taken for the Testimony
of a frighted Conscience, which, betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it self, discovered what you was going
to do, or what you had done. If you
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:44396:64"/>
were in the Reputation of having Courage
and Resolution, they fear'd you as a bold
Man, capable of understanding all things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
To Speak, to be Silent, to Rejoyce, to be
Afflicted, to be Fearful or Assured, all was
Criminal, and very often incurr'd the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
Punishments.</p>
            <p>Thus the Suspicions of others rendred
you culpable; it was not enough to wipe
off the Corruption of your Accusers, the
false Reports of Spies, the Suppositions of
some Infamous Informer, you were also to
fear the Imagination of the Emperour; and
when you thought to be secure by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence
not only of your Actions, but of
your Thoughts, you would be ruined by
the Malice of his Conjectures.</p>
            <p>To push the matter no further, there
was need of much Desert to be a person of
Credit; for by that there were many mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes
to be endured. That Vertue,
which durst appear, was infallibly lost, and
that which was but guessed at, was never
assured.</p>
            <p>As one is not exempt from Perplexity in
the Evil which one makes others endure.
<hi>Tiberius</hi> was not always at Peace in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of his Cruelties. <hi>Sejanus</hi> who insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:44396:64"/>
into his Favours, by ways as unjust
as his own; this great Favourite surfeited
with Honours and Riches, which left him
always in a Dependance, had a desire to
free himself from all Subjection, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
nothing to put himself insensibly in the
place of his Master.</p>
            <p>Being instructed in the Maxims of the
Emperour, and knowing in his Art, he
took off his Children by Poison, and was
upon the point of dispatching him, when
this Prince returning from his Blindness, as
by a Miracle, preserv'd his unhappy days,
and destroyed this great Confident that
would have ruined him.</p>
            <p>His condition was not more happy than
before; he lived odious to all the World,
and troublesom to himself, an Enemy to the
Lives of others, as well as to his own: at
length he died, to the great Joy of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
not being able to escape the impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
of a Successor, who caused him to be
stifled in a Sickness he was going to be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of.</p>
            <p>I once made a Reflection upon the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
there was between the Republick
and the Empire, and it appears to me, that
it had not been less pleasant to live under
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:44396:65"/>
Emperours, than under Consuls, if so be
the Maxims of <hi>Augustus</hi> had been pursued.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rome</hi> was not so happy. The Politicks
of <hi>Tiberius</hi> were embraced by the greatest
part of his Successours, who placed the
Honour of their Reign, not in governing
the Empire best, but in enslaving it the
most.</p>
            <p>In this opinion <hi>Augustus</hi> was les esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
for having known how to make the
<hi>Romans</hi> happy, than <hi>Tiberius</hi> for having
made them miserable without help. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to these Emperours, that it was a
mark of Insufficiency or Weakness to keep
the Laws; and sometimes the art of delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
them, made the Secret of their Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
sometimes the violence of breaking
through them, appeared a true Greatness,
and a worthy Authority.</p>
            <p>The Forces of the Empire no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
Strangers, the Power of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
was felt by the Natives and oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<hi>Romans</hi> held the place of the subdued
Nations.</p>
            <p>At length the <hi>Caligula's,</hi> the <hi>Nero's,</hi> and
the <hi>Domitian's</hi> push'd the Dominion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all Bounds; and although the Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives
of Emperours were infinitely below
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:44396:65"/>
those of the Kings, they dispos'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to Violences, which <hi>Tarquin</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
would not have done.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> of their side became equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fatal to the Emperours, for passing from
Slavery to Fury, they Massacred some of
them, and attributed to themselves an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
and violent Power to depose and set
them up at their Fancy.</p>
            <p>Thus the Bonds of Government were
broken, and the Duties of Society coming
to fail, they had no other aim but to ruin
those that obeyed, or to destroy those that
should have commanded others.</p>
            <p>So strange a confusion ought chiefly to be
imputed to the ill nature of these Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
and to the brutish Violence of the
Soldiers; but if you'd ascend to the first
Cause, you will find that this ill nature was
authorized by the Example of <hi>Tiberius,</hi>
and the Government established upon the
Maxims, which he hath left.</p>
            <p>As those, who concert things the best,
don't always stick to the justice of Rules,
the most Irregular don't eternally follow
the disorders of their Inclinations, and their
Humours.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:44396:66"/>They add at least a Policy to their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
Even those who do all things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Deliberation, return there by Reflection,
when they are done, and apply a Conduct
of Interest to the pure Motions of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>But let the Emperours have acted by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
by Policy, or both together, I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that <hi>Tiberius</hi> hath corrupted every
thing that was good, and hath introduced
every thing that was bad in the Empire.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Augustus,</hi> who had a pure and delicate
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ight into things, knew admirably well the
Genius of his time, and had no trouble in
changing a Subjection, voluntary in the
Captains of Parties, into a true one.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tiberius</hi> full of Frauds and Subtilty, but
a false Judgment, scorned to search into the
disposition of Spirits. He thought he had
to do with those old <hi>Romans</hi> amorous of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
and incapable of any Subjection:
in the mean time the general inclination
was to serve, and the least enslaved were
disposed to Obedience.</p>
            <p>This false account of things made him
take cruel Cautions against persons, he
fear'd without Cause; for it is to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
That a Prince so suspicious had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:44396:66"/>
occasion to fear any one, but <hi>Sejanus,</hi>
who made him distrust all others.</p>
            <p>With his false measures Cruelty en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd
every day, and as he that offends,
is the first in hating, the <hi>Romans</hi> became
odious to him, by the injury which he did
to them. At length he acted openly, and
treated them as his Enemies, because he
had afforded them an occasion to be so.</p>
            <p>The humours of Yeilding, which reigned
then, made his Tyranny endured without
Complaints. They suffered the brutality
of <hi>Caligula</hi> with the like Submission, for
his Death is a particular Fact, wherein nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Senate, People, nor Legions were
concerned. They suffered the dangerous
Stupidity of <hi>Claudius,</hi> and the insolence of
<hi>Messalina.</hi> They suffered the Fury of <hi>Nero,</hi>
till their Patience being exhausted, there
was a Revolution in Men's Minds.</p>
            <p>Immediately there was a Conspiracy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his Person, from particular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations,
they came to the revolt of the
Legions, from the revolt of the Legions to
the Declaration of the Senate. It may be
the Senate could have Re-established Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
but being already accustomed to
Emperours, they were contented to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:44396:67"/>
of the Empire, the Praetorian Cohorts
would dispose thereof themselves, and the
Legions of the Provinces could not yield
them that advantage. A Division intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
amongst these, some nominating one
Emperour, some another. There was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Massacres, and Civil Wars, and
never were Peoples Minds in their true Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation;
if you except the Reign of some
Princes, who knew how to re-unite the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests,
which the false Conduct of <hi>Tiberi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
had divided for the common Misfortune
of the Emperours, and Empire.</p>

            <head>OBSERVATIONS
UPON
SALUST and TACITUS.</head>
            <p>I Once intended to have made an exact
Judgment of <hi>Salust</hi> and <hi>Tacitus,</hi> but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
since, that others had already
done it, that I might neither wholly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
or lose my Design, I have reduced my
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:44396:67"/>
Thoughts to one single Observation, which
I send you.</p>
            <p>In my Opinion, the last turns every
thing into Policy, with him Nature and
Fortune have very little to do in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of Affairs, and I am deceived, or
he oftentimes gives too far fetcht Causes of
some Actions, which are altogether Simple,
Ordinary, and Natural.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Augustus</hi> would set Bounds to the
Empire, it is in his Conceit out of a jealous
Apprehension, least some other should have
the Glory of extending it. The same
Emperour, if you believe him, took mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
to assure himself, that the People of
<hi>Rome</hi> should have a Concern for him, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificially
managing the Advantages of his
Memory, by the choice of his Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sour.</p>
            <p>The dangerous temper of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> his
Dissimulations are known to all the World;
but it is not enough to know the Nature of
the Man, without giving this Prince a Craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiness
in every thing: Nature is not yet so
much reduced, but that she keeps as much
Right over our Actions, as we can take o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
her Motions. Something of ones Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
always enters into the best form'd De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs:
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:44396:68"/>
And it is not credible, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat <hi>Tiberi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
who was so many years subject to the
Will of <hi>Sejanus,</hi> or his own Infamous Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
could have, in that Weakness, and
abandoning up of himself, so far fetched
an Act, and so studied Politicks.</p>
            <p>The Poysoning of <hi>Britannicus</hi> causes not
so much Horrour, as it should, by <hi>Tacitus</hi>
his putting us upon the observing the Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
of the Spectators: So long as the
Reader is taken up in considering the divers
Motions they are in, the one's being fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out of Imprudence, others deeply reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on it, <hi>Nero</hi>'s dissembled Coldness, the
secret Fears of <hi>Agrippina,</hi> their Spirits turn'd
off from the blackness of the Action, and
from the sad Image of this Death, lets the
Parricide escape their hatred, and leaves
the unhappy dying Person to their Pity.</p>
            <p>The Cruelty of the same <hi>Nero</hi> in his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Death, has too delicate a Conduct,
when <hi>Agrippina</hi> had certainly perished by a
small Intriegue of Court so well managed,
he ought at least to have suppressed half the
Art, for the Crime finds less aversion in
our Spirits, and if I may say so, he recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciles
the Judgments of the Readers to it,
when he puts so much Address and Dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in the Conduct.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:44396:68"/>Almost in all things <hi>Tacitus</hi> leaves us pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
too finished, where he leaves us no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to be desired of Art, but where he
gives us too little of the Natural. Nothing
is finer than what he represents; oftentimes
'tis not the thing which ought to be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented;
sometimes he passes beyond things
by too great a Depth and Penetration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Sometimes Speculations too fine rob us of
the true Objects, to place in their stead <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ine
Ideas. What one may say in his Favour is,
that he obliges us more than he had done,
in giving us things grosly, the truth of
which had been of no importance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Salust,</hi> of a Spirit opposite enough, gives
as much to Nature, as the other to Policy.
The greatest care of the former is to make
known the Genius of Men, Affairs come
afterwards naturally, by the Actions not
far fetch'd of those Persons, whom he
hath described.</p>
            <p>If you consider with Attention, the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of <hi>Catiline,</hi> you will not be astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at that horrible design to oppress the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
nor at that vast project, to render
himself Master of the Re-publick, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the assistance of the Legions. When
you shall reflect on his Pliantness, his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuations,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:44396:69"/>
his Faculty of inspiring his
Motions, and uniting the Factious Persons
to himself; when you shall consider that so
much Dissiulation was sustained by so much
fierceness, when there was a necessity for
Action, you will not be surprised, that at
the head of all the Ambitious, and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
Men, he was so near over<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> whelming
<hi>Rome,</hi> and ruining his Country. But <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lust</hi>
doth not content himself with descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
the men to us in Characters, he makes
them describe themselves in Speeches,
where you always see an expression of their
Nature. The Oration of <hi>Caesar</hi> made it
plain enough to us, that a Conspiracy did
not displease him. Under the Zeal which
he testifies for the preservation of the Laws,
and the Dignity of the Senate, he leaves
to be discerned a delicate inclination for the
Conspirators; he is not so careful to hide
his Opinion of Hell; the Gods are less con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
to him than the Consuls, and in
his Conceit Death is nothing else but the
end of our Torments, and the repose of
the Miserable. <hi>Cato</hi> makes his own Picture,
after <hi>Caesar</hi> had given us his. He goes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
to that which is good, but with a
rough Air: the Austerity of his Manners
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:44396:69"/>
is inseparable from the integrity of his Life;
he mixes the sowerness of his mind, and
the hardness of his manners, with the use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
of his Counsels.</p>
            <p>This single expression of <hi>(Optimo Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suli)</hi>
which vexed <hi>Cicero</hi> so much, for not
giving to his merit extent enough, makes
me fully comprehend both the good inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and the vain humour of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul.
To conclude, by the various descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of different Actors, I not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
to my self the persons, but I seem
to behold every thing that passed in the
Conspiracy of <hi>Cataline.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You may observe the same thing in the
History of <hi>Iugurtha.</hi> The description of
his qualities and his humour, prepares you
to see the Invasion of a Kingdom, and three
lines shew his whole method of making
War. You see in the Character of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellus,</hi>
with the re-establishment of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
a happy alteration of the <hi>Roman</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Marius</hi> managed the Army in <hi>Africk</hi>
with the same Spirit, wherewith he spoke
at <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sylla</hi> talks to <hi>Boccus,</hi> with the same Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
that appeared in his Character, little
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:44396:70"/>
tied to Duty and Regularity, giving all
things up to the passion of making Friends
to himself. <hi>Dein parentes abunde habemus,
amicorum unquam neque nobis, neque cui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam
omnium satis fuit.</hi> Thus <hi>Salust</hi> makes
Men Act by their temper, and thinks to
oblige his Reader enough, by describing
them well. Every extraordinary person
that's represented, is exactly drawn, even
when he has no considerable part in his
Subject. Such is the Character of <hi>Sempro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>
in my Judgment, inimitable; he goes
even to search remote considerations, to
give us the Pictures of <hi>Cato</hi> and <hi>Caesar,</hi> so
fine in truth, that I should prefer them
before entire Histories.</p>
            <p>To conclude my observation upon these
two Authors, Ambition, Avarice, Luxury,
Corruption, all the general causes of the
Disorders of the Republick, are very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
alledged by <hi>Salust.</hi> I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he descends enough to particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests
and Considerations. You will say,
that subtle and refined Counsels seemed to
him unworthy of the grandeur of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick;
and that is perhaps the reason,
that he goes to seek as it were all things
in Speculation, few things in the Passions
and Genius of Men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:44396:70"/>One sees in the History of <hi>Tacitus</hi> yet
more Vices, more Wickedness, and more
Crimes; but Ingenuity conducts them,
and Dexterity manages them: one speaks
there always with design, there's no act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
without measure, the Cruelty is pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
and the Violence advised. In a word,
the crime there is too delicate; from whence
it comes to pass, that men of the most cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
taste the Art of mischief, which doth
not let it self be known enough, and that
they learn to become Criminal before they
are aware, imagining only to become ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert.
But leaving here <hi>Salust</hi> and <hi>Tacitus,</hi>
in their different Characters, I will affirm,
that one meets but seldom together, a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
description of Men, and a profound
intelligence of things.</p>
            <p>Those that are brought up in Societies,
that speak in Assemblies, learn the order,
the forms, and all the matters that are
treated of there. Passing from thence
through Embassys, they instruct themselves
in Foreign affairs, and there are but a few
things, of what nature soever they be,
but they become capable of, through ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
and experience. But when they
come to settle at Court, they are look'd
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:44396:71"/>
upon as awkard in their choie of persons,
without any taste of Merit, ridiculous in
their Expences, and in their Pleasures.</p>
            <p>Our Ministers in <hi>France</hi> are altogether
free from these defects, I may affirm it of
them all without Flattery, and enlarge my
self a little upon <hi>Monsieur de Lionne,</hi> whom
I am better acquainted with.</p>
            <p>'Tis in him properly, that separated Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents
are collected; 'tis in him that meet
a curious knowledge of the merits of
Men, and a profound Intelligence of things.</p>
            <p>To speak the Truth, I have a Thousand
times admired, how a Minister, who hath
confounded all the Politicks of the <hi>Italians,</hi>
who hath disorder'd the settled Prudence
of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who hath turn'd to our
Interests so many Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> and
hath made them act as we would have
them, who were brought with much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
to act for themselves: I have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired,
I say, how a Man so compleat in
Negotiating, so well vers'd in affairs, can
have all the delicateness of the most polite
Courtiers for Conversation, and Pleasures.
One may say of him, what <hi>Salust</hi> affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of a Great person of Antiquity, <hi>that
his lisure is Voluptuous:</hi> but that by a just
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:44396:71"/>
dispensation of his time with the facility
of labour, which he hath made himself
Master of, never was any affair retarded
by his diversions.</p>
            <p>Amongst the divertisements of his lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
amongst his most important employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
he doth not cease to dedicate some
Hours to Learning, whereby <hi>Atticus,</hi> that
honest Man among the Ancients, did not
acquire a more curious knowledge in the
sweetness of his Repose, and the tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of his Study. He is infinitely skilled
in all things, and Learning, which very
often spoils the Nature, doth but embellish
his; it quits what it hath of obscure, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult,
rude, and brings him entirely all its
advantages, without disturbing the neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and politeness of his Spirit. No bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
is better acquainted with fine works,
than He; no body composes them better;
he knows equally how to judge and to
produce, and I am a little at a stand, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
one ought to esteem more in him the
fineness of his Judgment, or the beauty of
his Genius. It is time to leave his, and
come to that of the Courtiers.</p>
            <p>As they are educated near Kings, and
make their ordinary residence near Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:44396:72"/>
they make it their particular Study
to know them well: There is not an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
that is concealed from them, no
aversion unknown, no weakness which is
not discovered to them. From thence
comes insinuations, complaisance, and all
those curious measures which compose the
Art of winning hearts, or at least to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
their Wills; but whether it be for
want of application, or else thinking those
employments below them, where one's
instructed in affairs, they are equally ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of them all, and their agreements
coming to fail with their Age, nothing
affords them consideration and Credit.
They grow old then in the Closets, expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to the Raillery of the Young men, who
can't suffer their Censure, with this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
that these for the most part do
things that agree to their humour, and
that the others cannot abstain from those
that are unbecoming them; and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the most honest man, of whom no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
has need, finds it troublesome to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt
himself from being ridiculous in
growing old. But it is with them as with
those gallant Women, who are still pleas'd
with the World, when that's displeas'd
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:44396:72"/>
with them. If we were wise, our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust
would answer to that which is had
for us; for in the disadvantage of States,
where one doth not sustain himself but by
the merit of pleasing, when he ceases to be
agreeable, he ought to think of retiring.
Lawyers, on the other side, appear less
Genteel when they are young, by a false
Air of the Court, which makes them suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in the City, and renders them ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
to Courtiers: but at length th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
knowledge of their Interest brings them
to their Profession, and becoming expert
with Time, they find themselves in consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Stations, where all the World ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
stands in want of their assistance.
It is very true, that those Courtiers that
arise to Honours by great employments,
leave nothing to be desired in their suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency,
and their merit is fully perfected,
when they joyn to the nicety of the Court,
the knowledge of affairs, and the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of War.</p>

            <head>THE COMPARISON
OF
Caesar and Alexander.</head>
            <p>'TIS almost universally agreed, that
<hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Caesar</hi> have been the
greatest Men in the World: And all those
that have undertaken to Judge, have
thought to oblige the Heroes that came
after 'em, by finding some resemblance
between their Reputation and their Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
<hi>Plutarch,</hi> after having examined their
Natures, their Actions, and their Fortunes,
leaves us the liberty to decide, that he had
not assurance enough to undertake it.
<hi>Montagne,</hi> more confident, declares him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
for the former, and since the Versions
of <hi>Vaugelas</hi> and <hi>Ablancour,</hi> have made these
Heroes the Subject of all our Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
every one has embraced the part of
one or t'other, according to his own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Inclination or Fancy. As for me,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:44396:73"/>
who perhaps have examined their Lives
with as much curiosity as any person, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
I will not allow my self the
Authority of an absolute decision. But
because you are unwilling to dispence with
me from discovering my Thoughts, you
shall have some observations of the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and difference I find between 'em.
Both have had the Advantage of Illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Births. <hi>Alexander</hi> Son of a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
King; <hi>Caesar</hi> descends from one of
the most Noble Families of that Republick,
whose very Citizens esteem themselves
more than Kings. It seems that the Gods
had a mind to let us know the future gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur
of <hi>Alexander,</hi> by <hi>Olympias's</hi> Dream,
and by some other Presages. His inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
sublime from his Infancy, his Tears
which shew'd him jealous for the Glory
of his Father, the Judgment of King <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip,</hi>
who believed him worthy of a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Kingdom than his own, are sufficient
supports for the declaration of the Gods.
Many things of this Nature have been no
less remarkable in relation to <hi>Caesar. Sylla</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
in him, tho' he was very young,
many <hi>Marius</hi>'s. He dream't that he had
lain with his Mother, and the Sooth-sayers
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:44396:74"/>
interpreted, <hi>that the Earth the common Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of mankind, should be subjected to his
Power.</hi> He was observ'd to weep, when
he look'd upon the Statue of <hi>Alexander,</hi>
for having perform'd nothing considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
at an Age when this Conquerour had
made himself Master of the World. They
were both Passionate Lovers of Learning;
but <hi>Alexander</hi> in every thing Ambitious,
was Jealous of any Superiority in his Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and his chief Prospect in Sciences,
was to exceed all others. So we may see
that he complain'd of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> for publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
some mysterious matters, which ought
to have been reserv'd for him alone, and
he declares, that he a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pires no less to raise
himself above Men by his Learning than
his Arms. As he had a most curious Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,
and whose Passions were easily rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
so he was addicted to the searching
after the most hidden Mysteries, and had
a particular Fancy for Poetry.</p>
            <p>There's no man can be ignorant of the
great affection he bore to <hi>Homer,</hi> and that
in favour of <hi>Pindar,</hi> the Houses of his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity
were conserv'd in the general ruine
and desolation of <hi>Thebes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Genius of <hi>Caesar,</hi> not altogether so
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:44396:74"/>
vast, reduced the Sciences to his own use,
and he seems to have admired Learning,
for no other purpose in the World, than
for his own advantage. In the Philosophy
of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> which he held preferable to
all others, he made his chief application to
that part which relates to Man. But it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
that Eloquence was his principal aim,
through a perswasion of mind, that 'tis
most necessary in a Republick, to arrive
at the highest employments. He made a
Funeral Oration in Publick at the death
of his Aunt <hi>Iulia,</hi> which succeeded with
great Applause. He accused <hi>Dolabella,</hi> and
afterwards made that Speech that was so
exact and so fine, for the saving the Lives
of those that were Imprison'd for <hi>Catiline's</hi>
Conspiracy.</p>
            <p>We have nothing that we have any as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
to be <hi>Alexanders,</hi> except some
smart sayings of an admirable Turn, which
leaves us an equal impression of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
of his Soul, and the vivacity of his
Genius.</p>
            <p>But the greatest distinction that I can
apprehend in their Sentiments, is upon the
Subject of Religion; for <hi>Alexander</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
even to Superstition, giving an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:44396:75"/>
credit to Divinations and Oracles;
which might be attributed, besides his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination,
to his usual reading of Poets, who
imprint in men a Fear and Reverence of the
Gods, and made up all the Divinity of those
times.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Caesar,</hi> whether it were out of a
pure natural temper, or else giving way
to the opinions of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> 'tis beyond dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
that he pass'd into the other extream,
had no expectation from the Gods in this
Life, and was very little concern'd about
the Thoughts and Accidents of the other.
<hi>Lucan</hi> represents him at the Siege of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seilles,</hi>
with an Axe in his hand in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated
Wood, where giving the first
stroaks himself, he encourages his Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
who were seized with a secret hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of Religion, with expressions impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
enough. <hi>Salust</hi> makes him affirm, <hi>that
Death is the conclusion of all misfortunes, that
after it there remains neither rememembrance
nor imaginations of Ioy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as men, be they never so great, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
one to another, are always infirm,
defective, contrary to themselves, subject
to Mistakes or Ignorance; <hi>Caesar</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
at a Dream, which predicted to him
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:44396:75"/>
the Empire, and would not give the least
Credit to that of his Wife, which adverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
him of his Death. His Life was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
to his Belief; he was in reality
moderate in indifferent Pleasures, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
himself nothing in those that affected
him. This was the cause that <hi>Catullus</hi> writ
so many Epigrams against him, and whence,
at last it became a Proverb, that <hi>Caesar</hi> was
the Wife of all Husbands, and the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
of all Wives.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> was moderate enough in this,
yet he was not altogether insensible, for
<hi>Barsine</hi> and <hi>Roxana</hi> made him Captive to
their Charms, and his Continence at last
could not restrain him from using <hi>Bagoas,</hi>
as <hi>Darius</hi> had formerly done.</p>
            <p>The pleasure of Banquering, which <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exander</hi>
loved so much, and where some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
he suffer'd himself to be carried, even
to Excess, was indifferent to <hi>Caesar;</hi> not
but that <hi>Alexander,</hi> in time of Action, was
very sober, and could easily endure a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue;
but when Ease and Repose had suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
the Toils of War, Tranquility he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem'd
as insipid, and unsavory, if he did
not stir it up, as it were, by some thing
extraordinary.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:44396:76"/>
They were both magnificent, even to
Profusion: but <hi>Caesar</hi> with more of Design
and Interest. His Gratuities to the People,
his excessive Expences in the Edileship, his
Present to <hi>Curio,</hi> were properly, rather
Corruptions than true Liberalities. <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>'s
Gifts proceeded from a pure greatness
of Soul. When he pass'd into <hi>Asia,</hi> he distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
his Patrimony, he left himself desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
and had no other prospect than the
hopes of Conquest, or a resolution to dye.
At a time, when he hardly wanted the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
of a Man, he discharg'd the Debts
of the whole Army. Limners, Engravers,
Musicians, Poets, Philosophers (all fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
in their way, but generally in want)
did partake of his Magnificence, and were
sensible of his Grandeur; not but that <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>
also was naturally dispos'd to be Liberal;
but out of a design to raise himself, he was
obliged to gain Persons necessary for his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
and he hardly saw himself Master of
the Empire, but he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was unhappily deprived
of it, together with his Life. I don't find
in <hi>Caesar</hi> those Friendships that <hi>Alexander</hi>
ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> for <hi>Hephestion,</hi> nor that Confidence
that he had in <hi>Craterus.</hi> His Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
were either Obligations for his own
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:44396:76"/>
Affairs, or else a Proceeding complaisant
enough, but much less passionate in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to his Friends. 'Tis true, his Familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
had nothing in it of Danger, and those
that were his Intimates, never apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Wrath, nor his Humours. As <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
was in extreams, either he was the most
Charming, or the most formidable Person,
and there was no security to be expected in
an Intriegue wherein he himself was enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged;
notwithstanding Friendship, after
Glory, was his greatest Passion, of which
there needs no other Testimony, than his
own Expression, when he cried out near
the Statue of <hi>Achilles:</hi> O <hi>Achilles,</hi> how hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
do I esteem thee, in that thou hadst a
faithful Companion during thy Life, and
such a Poet as <hi>Homer</hi> after Death!</p>
            <p>Hitherto we have examined the Natures
of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>se two great Men, 'tis now time to
make a Scrutiny into the Genius's of the
Conquerors, and to consider 'em in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
extent of Action. 'Tis a kind of Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to reason much upon things purely
Imaginary; notwithstanding in all appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
if <hi>Alexander</hi> had been in <hi>Caesar</hi>'s place,
he had made no better use of his great and
admirable Qualities, than to his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:44396:77"/>
Destruction. One may suppose that
his haughty Humour, which scorn'd to
take any care of preventing things, would
have but ill preserved him in the persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of <hi>Sylla,</hi> he would hardly have been
brought to secure himself by a voluntary
Absence. As his Gifts proceeded out of a
principle of Generosity, they would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
have proved pernicious to him.
Instead of waiting for the Edileship, where
his Magnificence and Profusions had been
permitted, his Largesses and Presents at an
unseasonable time, would have render'd
him justly suspected to the Senate. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
too, he could not have confined him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to those Laws, they would have tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
a Soul so imperious as his, and by
undertaking something at an inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
time, he would have found the Desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of <hi>Manlius,</hi> of the <hi>Gracchi</hi>'s, or that of
<hi>Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>iline.</hi> But then, if <hi>Alexander</hi> had pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished
in the Republick, <hi>Caesar,</hi> whose Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and Wariness went ordinarily toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
had never entertain'd in his Thoughts,
the vast design of the Conquest of <hi>Asia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis to be believed of <hi>Caesar,</hi> whose Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
was so delicate, and so secret, that he
entred into all Conspiracies, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:44396:77"/>
(except once) accused, and never
convicted: He that in the Divisions of
his own making amongst the Gauls, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
one to oppress the other, and brought
them all under at the last: 'Tis to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
I say, that this same <hi>Caesar</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his own Genius, would have establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the State, subdued his Neighbours, and
set all the Republick of <hi>Greece</hi> at diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
one with another, in order to have
made himself Master of them. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
to have relinquished <hi>Macedon</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the least hope of return, to have left
his Neighbours disaffected; <hi>Greece</hi> in a

to the new method of Government, with

that he would not rest satisfied with the

any Reason in my Conjectures, he would
hardly have been so inquisitive after the
King of <hi>Persia,</hi> in the Plains, attended by

of his Life; 'twas necessary, that
he fell as he did, or that a thousand diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
People should observe him vanquished
with his whole Power.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, that this immoderate desire of
Glory, and this excessive Ambition which
allowed him no interval of Repose, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
him at some particular times so insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable
to the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> that they
were all ready to abandon him; but 'tis
there particularly, that is observed, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
Courage which nothing could a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.

            </p>
            <p>In all the Passages of his Life, the Prince
of <hi>Conde</hi> admired nothing more than this
brave fierceness to the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> and
this Confidence in himself. <hi>Alexander,</hi>

Nations, who were not throughly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued,
was so perswaded of his own Worthiness,
and Capacity to Command, that he thought it
not in the Power of men to refuse to pay him
Obeisance.</hi> To reside in <hi>Europe,</hi> or in <hi>Asia,</hi>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:44396:79"/>
amongst <hi>Greeks,</hi> or amongst <hi>Persians,</hi> each
was indifferent to him; he was assured to
meet with Subjects where he found Men.
That which is said to the advantage of <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>
is this, that the <hi>Macedonians</hi> were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
against a People drowned in Ease,
and Cowardise, and that the Conquest of
the <hi>Gauls,</hi> who are a fierce and Military
People, must of necessity be much harder
to the <hi>Romans.</hi> I won't amuse my self, by
enquiring into the Courage of one or
t'other, but 'tis certain, that <hi>Caesar</hi> never
found real, and substancial Armies amongst
the <hi>Gauls.</hi> There was entire Nations, if
you reserve the Women, Children, and
Old Men, who made a Tumultuary Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly

might boast, <hi>Veni, Vidi, Vici,</hi> in all his
Undertakings; which makes me thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

the Legions, would have had the same
good Fortune to subject our Provinces to

of things <hi>Parmenio</hi> had not given that

way observe also this remarkable particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
that <hi>Parmenio</hi> wanted <hi>Alexanders</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
in the Battel, and that <hi>Caesar</hi> had
been infallibly lost without <hi>Labienus,</hi> who

Tenth Legion to disengage him. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were that he undertook more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
enterprises, or else by exposing
himself more than he need, or whether
he was in this point the more unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
<hi>Alexander</hi> was a hundred times in
manifest danger of his Life, and very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
extreamly wounded. 'Tis certain too,
that <hi>Caesar</hi> had his Hazards, but more
rarely, and I'm in suspence whether he was
ever much Wounded in all his Wars. For
my part, I can't conjecture how the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Asia</hi> should be so soft and pusillani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,
they, that have been always for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable
to <hi>Europe.</hi> In the greatest power
of the Republick, have not the <hi>Romans</hi>
been unhappy in their Encounters with
the <hi>Parthians,</hi> who possessed but one part
of the Empire of <hi>Darius? Crassus</hi> was there
lost with his Legions in the time of <hi>Caesar;</hi>
and a little after, <hi>Anthony</hi> made an Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
thither with loss and shame. As for
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:44396:80"/>
Conquests, we can't justly attribute any
others to <hi>Caesar</hi> than those of <hi>Gaul:</hi> for by
the advantage of a Civil War, he subject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Common-wealth with the better
part of its own Forces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the single Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
of <hi>Pharsalia,</hi> rendred him absolute Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of a Hundred different people, which
others had subdued before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vespasian</hi> cannot be said to have Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd
the Empire, when he was made
Emperour upon the Defeat of <hi>Vitellius.</hi> So
<hi>Caesar</hi> has advantaged himself by the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
and Exploits of all the <hi>Romans:</hi> the
<hi>Scipio's, Emilius, Marcellus, Marius, Sylla,</hi>
and <hi>Pompey,</hi> even his own proper Enemies
have fought for him; and all that was
perform'd in 600 years, was the fruits of
one hours Battel. That which seems to
me still more incomprehensible, as to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi>
is this, that in twelve or thirteen
years he has subdued more Countreys, than
the greatest States in the whole extent of
their Durations. At this time a Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
is celebrated, for having passed but a
part of those Nations, that he subdued<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and that nothing might be deficient to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his Happiness compleat, he had a most
peaceable enjoyment of his Empire, even
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:44396:80"/>
so far as to be adored by the Conquered.
In which particular I pity the misfortune
of <hi>Caesar,</hi> who had not opportunity enough
to give a form to the State conformable
to his intentions, being Assassinated by
those he went to reduce to a Compliance.
There remains still one consideration upon
<hi>Alexander, viz.</hi> that all the <hi>Macedonian</hi>
Captains, after his Death, were powerful
Kings, who compar'd to him when alive,
appear'd but as indifferent persons. And
certainly, he's in some measure pardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
if in a Countrey where was a strong
Belief that the greatest part of the Gods
had once their Habitations upon Earth,
where <hi>Hercules</hi> was suppos'd to be the Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring
of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> because he had the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
to slay a Lion, and to rid the World
of a pernicious Robber: I say, sure he's
pardonable in some measure, if having a
reliance on the opinion of <hi>Philip,</hi> who was
under a perswasion that his Wife had some
communication with a Deity, if impos'd
on and flattered by the Oracle; if upon find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself so much above ordinary men,
he has sometimes disown'd his real Birth,
and given credit to the sentiments of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Race. Perhaps he only dispers'd this Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:44396:81"/>
amongst the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> to attract from
'em Veneration, for at the time he put
himself out to the World for a kind of a
God, his natural Slumbers, his Society
with Women, the Bloud which came from
his Wounded Body, made him sensible he
was but a Man. After so large a discourse
of the advantages of <hi>Alexander,</hi> I'l briefly
affirm, that through the Beauty of a Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Genius, <hi>Caesar</hi> was the greatest of
the <hi>Romans</hi> in all respects, both in matters
of the State, and those of War. In reality
the enterprizes of <hi>Alexander,</hi> have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in them more amazing; but the
conduct and the capacity must not stand
for so great a share: The War of <hi>Spain</hi>
against <hi>Petreius</hi> and <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ranius,</hi> is a passage
that men of approved experience yet ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire.
The most memorable Sieges of the
latter times, have been form'd in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Siege of <hi>Alexia,</hi> and to <hi>Caesar</hi> is
owing our Fortifications, our Lines, our
Contravallations, and every thing that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
relates to the security of Armies
before the places Besieged. As to what
regards Vigour, the Battel of <hi>Munda</hi> was
by far more contested than those of <hi>Asia;</hi>
and <hi>Caesar</hi> run as great a risque in <hi>Egypt,</hi>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:44396:81"/>
as <hi>Alexander</hi> did in the Town of the <hi>Mallians.</hi>
They were no less different in the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
than in the action. When <hi>Caesar</hi> had
not the Justice of his side, he search'd for
appearances, and praetexts were never
wanting to him. <hi>Alexander</hi> gave no other
reasons to the World than his own Will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
he followed throughout either his Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or his Humour. <hi>Caesar</hi> on the other
side suffer'd himself to be conducted eithe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
by his Interest, or his Reason.</p>
            <p>There never was observ'd in any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
so much equality in Life, so much Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
in Fortune, and so much Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in apparent Injuries. Those impetuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ies
which cost poor <hi>Clitus</hi> his Life, those ill
made out Suspicions, which occasion'd the
loss of <hi>Philotas,</hi> and which to the Infamy
of <hi>Alexander,</hi> at length drew on, as a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
misfortune, the death of <hi>Parmenio<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
all these irregular motions were unknown
to <hi>Caesar:</hi> he is irreproachable in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
except in relation to himself, for
not having been careful enough of his own
proper Security.</p>
            <p>It must be acknowledged, that instead
of being subject to the disorders of his Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
he was the most active Man of the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:44396:82"/>
World, and the least liable to disturbance.
Great things and little things, found him
still easy, without being raised by the one,
or dejected by the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> seem'd to be out of his way,
but when he was doing extraordinary
things. If he was to Run, it was to be
with none but Kings; if he loved Hunting
it was that of Lions; he could not make
a Present unworthy of himself: He was
at no time so resolute, nor in so good a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
as at the despondency of his Troops:
never so full of hope, as in their despair.
In a word, he began to enjoy himself, when
Men for the most part, either through Fear,
or some other Infirmity, are us'd to give
themselves up to their Afflictions. But
his too elevated Soul, could not easily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
with the common Accidents of Life;
and hardly secure of himself, it was to be
f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ar'd least he should be lost either amidst
his Pleasures or his Ease.</p>
            <p>Here I must oblige my self to make some
reflections upon the Heroes, whose Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
has so much sweetness in it, that
without trouble we submit to it. There
remains with us, none of those secret re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnances
for 'em, nor those internal no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:44396:82"/>
of Liberty, which are so painful to
us in a forced Obedience. All our quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
are easy and compliant, but what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from them is sometimes insupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
When they are our Masters by
power, and so much beyond us in regard
of their desert, they think to enjoy a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Empire, which exacts a double subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
and very often 'tis a miserable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to have our dependance upon Men
that are so great, that they may with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
despise us. In the mean time, since
they don't rule in Desarts, and that they
are under a necessity of conversing with
us, methinks it should be for their Interest
to accommodate themselves to our Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
and we would then justly respect
'em as Gods, when they would be content
to live as men. But let me conclude a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
which begins to grow tedious to
my self, and determine, that by practica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
means <hi>Caesar</hi> hath executed the greatest
things, and hath rendred himself the first
of the <hi>Romans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> was naturally above Men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
you'd say that he was Born Master of the
Universe, and that in his Expeditions he
rather sought to make himself taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:44396:83"/>
of by his People, than to encounter
his Foes.</p>

         <div type="part">
            <head>A Discourse upon
THE
FRENCH Historians.</head>
            <p>IT is to be acknowledged that the greatest
part of our Historians have had but an
indifferent merit, and without the natural
desire of knowing what has come to pass in
their own Countreys, I can't imagine how a
p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rson, that has good Skill in ancient Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories,
could perswade himself to suffer
the tediousness which ours afford. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
'tis strange enough, that in a Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy
where there has been so many memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Wars, and so many signal alterations
of affairs; that amongst a People that have
a Courage to perform great things, and a
Vanity to speak of them, there should not
be one Historian, that answers either to the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:44396:83"/>
Dignity of the Subject, or to our own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
inclination.</p>
            <p>I was of opinion formerly, that one
ought to attribute this defect to our Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage;
but when I have since considered,
that the Beauty of the <hi>French</hi> in the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation
almost equalled that of the <hi>Greek</hi>
and <hi>Latin</hi> in the Original, it is come into
my Thoughts in spight of my self, that
the indifference of our Genius is below the
Majesty of History. Besides, if so be there
were amongst us some Genius's of a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
height, there are too many things
necessary to the composition of a fine Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,
to be able to meet with them in one
and the same person. One might find per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
a stile pure enough and noble enough
in some of our Authors, who by reason
of their living at a distance from the Court
and Business, would handle them with ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
maxims and common places, which
relish more of the Policy of Antiquity, than
ours. Our experienc'd men of business
have a great knowledge of our own Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests;
but they have the disadvantage of
being used to a certain stile of dispatch,
as proper for Negotiations, as it is little
agreeable to the Dignity of History. It is
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:44396:84"/>
also a usual thing with them, to speak ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ill of War; unless Fortune has laid it in
their way to be concerned therein some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
or they have lived in the acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and familiarity of Great Men, that
have had the management thereof: That
has been a considerable defect in <hi>Grotius,</hi>
who after he had pierced into the most
secret causes of the War, the nature of the
Government of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> the disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the People of <hi>Flanders;</hi> who, after
he had entred into the true Genius of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
forms a just Character of Societies
and that of principal persons; who after
he had so well explained the different States
of the Christian Religion; who after he
had ascended to Originals, unknown to
Cardinal <hi>Bentivoglio</hi> and to <hi>Strada,</hi> could
not maintain in mens minds the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which he had caused there, so soon
as he was to open the Field of War, when
he was to speak of the motion of Armies,
and come to the description of Sieges, and
to the recital of Battels.</p>
            <p>We have some Persons of Quality of an
extraordinary merit, who for having exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
great employments with a good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Judgment, and some acquired know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:44396:84"/>
are equally capable of acting well
and speaking well; but generally they
want a Genius, or have not the Art of
Writing well: Besides that, referring all
things to their own way, and the functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their Charges, they seek little to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
themselves in the forms of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and Orders of the Kingdom.
They would imagine to do themselves
wrong, and take the Spirit of the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers
against the Dignity of their Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
if so be they should apply themselves
to the knowledge of our Principal Laws.
And without those Lights <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>I durst assure,
that it is as it were impossible, to make
a good History filled (as it ought to be)
with sound and judicious Instructions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bacon</hi> often complained, that Historians
took pleasure in extending themselves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Foreign affairs, and that they seemed
to avoid as a weakness, the discourse of
Rules, which compose the publick Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility:
That letting themselves go, with
Joy, to the recital of those Evils which
War brings, they don't treat of, but with
distaste, the good Laws, which establish
the happiness of a Civil Society. His com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
appear to me so much the better
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:44396:85"/>
founded, inasmuch as there is not one
History amongst the <hi>Romans,</hi> but where
we discern the in side of the Republick, by
its Laws, as well as the out-side by its
Conquests. You see in <hi>Livy,</hi> sometimes
the abolishing of old Laws, and sometimes
the establishment of new ones; you see
there every thing that depends on Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and what relates to Ceremonies. The
Conspiracy of <hi>Catiline</hi> in <hi>Salust,</hi> is quite
full of the Constitutions of the Republick;
and the Speech of <hi>Caesar</hi> so delicate, doth
it not all roll upon the <hi>Portian</hi> Law, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the just considerations their Fathers had
for quitting the ancient rigour in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
of Citizens, upon the dangerous
consequences which would follow, if so be
so wise an Ordinance should be violated?</p>
            <p>The same <hi>Caesar</hi> in his Commentaries,
never loses an occasion to speak of the
Manners, Customs, and Religion of the
<hi>Gauls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tacitus</hi> is perhaps but too full of Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations,
Defences, Laws, and Judgments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quintus Curtius,</hi> in a History made to
please more than to instruct, puts at the
mouth of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Laws of the <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians,</hi>
to answer the reproaches of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molaus,</hi>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:44396:85"/>
who had Conspired against his
Life.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Alexander</hi> that seems to have
known no other Laws, than his own Will,
in the Conquest of the World.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Alexander</hi> doth not scorn to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
himself by the Authority of the Laws,
for having ordered a young Lad to be
Whipt, when he was Master of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse.</p>
            <p>As there is no Nation, that is unwilling
to secure it self from Foreign Violences,
when it is infirm, or to render its conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
more glorious by Conquests, when it
is Powerful. As there is none, but ought
to assure its repose by the constitution of
a good Government, and the Tranquillity
of the Conscience by the Sentiments of
their Religion; so there is no Historian,
but ought to be instructed in all these dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Interests, when he undertakes their
History; but ought to make known what
renders men unhappy, to the end that it
may be avoided, or what makes their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,
that it may be procured. One can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
write a good History of <hi>France,</hi> for all
the Wars that are to be be described, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
shewing the orders of the Kingdom,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:44396:86"/>
the difference of Religion, and the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church.</p>
            <p>It would be ridiculous to undertake to
write that of <hi>England,</hi> without knowing
the Affairs of the Parliament, and being
well instructed in the different Religions
of this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>It would not be less to attempt that of
<hi>Spain,</hi> without knowing exactly the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
forms of its Counsels, and the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of its Inquisition, as well as the secret
of its Foreign Interests, and the motives,
and successes of its Wars.</p>
            <p>But in truth, these diversities of Laws,
Religion, Politicks, and War, ought to be
ingeniously mingled, and very discreetly
managed: For a Man, that should affect
to speak often of the Constitution and
Laws of a State, would rather savour of
the Legislatour or Lawyer, than the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian.
To treat of each point of Religion
with a meditated curiosity, would be to
make Lectures of Divinity; and one should
suffer him with pain in the History of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Paul,</hi> if one did not pardon the tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of his Controversys between the
Doctors, by the necessity of his Subject.</p>
            <p>Although the Description of Wars seem
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:44396:86"/>
to hold the first place in History, 'tis to
appear a sort of a troublesome Romancer,
to heap up accidents upon accidents, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any diversity of matter, 'tis to find
the means in true Subjects of imitating the
manner of the Old Romance-makers, in
their false Combats, and fabulous Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Latin</hi> Historians have known how
to mingle admirably the divers pieces of
Knowledge, that I have treated of: so the
History of the <hi>Romans</hi> ought to have some
resemblance with their Lives, which were
divided in the different Offices of several
Professions. Indeed, there has hardly been
any Great Persons at <hi>Rome,</hi> but have passed
through the Dignities of the Priesthood,
have belonged to the Senate, and taken
from thence to Command Armys. Now
a days every Profession takes up a man
wholly: The greatest Vertue of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
is to apply themselves intirely to Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
affairs; and those whose ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
hath push'd them to the management
of Business, have gone through a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
reproaches for having corrupted the
Sanctity of Life they were destined to.
The Lawyers are made ridiculous, so soon
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:44396:87"/>
as they go out of their Profession; and a
Souldier is for the most part ashamed, to
know any thing beyond his Art.</p>
            <p>It is certain notwithstanding, that the
divers applications of the Ancients, form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a capacity much more extensive, the
same persons understanding how to employ
well the forces of the Republick, and to
contain the People by the Reverence of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and by the Authority of the Laws.
It was a great advantage to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
to be Masters of the strongest im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,
which are made upon the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
and to seise on all the Sentiments,
whereby they are disposed to the being
tractable, or constrained to Obedience. It
was not a less benefit to Generals to be
instructed in the Secrets of their Religion,
to be able to inspire their own Notions,
and to make them received with the
same respect, as if they had been truly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired
by the Gods; to have the Art of
turning all things into Presages of good or
ill Fortune, aud to know seasonably how
to fill the Souldiers with Confidence or
Fear. But there returned yet another ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to the Republick, to wit, that
the Magistrates made themselves entirely
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:44396:87"/>
known; for it was impossible that in these
different functions, the most profound na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
should equally conceal it self through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
and that these good or ill Qualities
should not be at length discerned. One dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
in these limited Genius's, whom
Nature hath restrained to certain Talents,
that a sweet and peaceable Temper, which
was accommodated to the Ministry of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
had not sometimes constancy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to maintain the Laws in Vigour.</p>
            <p>Sometimes a Senator could not be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
in Trials, who had neither the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
nor vigilance of a good Captain.</p>
            <p>Such was a Great Warriour, as <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
who had no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>apacity in what related
to Religion and business. To speak the
Truth, there was often a general suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency,
and a compleat Vertue throughout,
which might render the Citizens useful to
the Publick in all things, but oftentimes
also a capacity not so large, made Men to
be employed to certain uses, for which
they were but just fit.</p>
            <p>'Tis this which hath been seen in the
Consulship of <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Antonius,</hi> where
the first had orders to watch for the safety
of the Republick according to his Talent,

            <p>If one makes reflection upon what I
have said, one will not be surprized to
find excellent Historians amongst a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
where those that writ History were
most frequently very considerable persons,
to whom was wanting ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>, nor
the Art of Writing well, and who had in
an equal measure a profound knowledge
of the affairs of Religion, War, and Men.
To affirm the Truth, the Ancients had a
great Advantage over us in knowing the
Genius of Men by these different proofs,
where they were obliged to pass into the
Administration of the Common-wealth;
but they have not been less careful in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing
them well, and whosoever will
examine their Characters with a little
curiosity and intelligence, shall discover
therein a particular Study, and an Art deep
laid.</p>
            <p>In effect you see them gather as it were
opposite qualities, which one could not
imagine to find in one and the same per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<hi>animus audax, subdolus:</hi> You see them
find a difference in certain qualities, which
appear to be absolutely th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> same, and
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:44396:88"/>
which one cannot discover without a
great nicety of Judgment: <hi>subdolus; va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius;
cujuslibet rei simulator, ac dissimulator.</hi>
There is another diversity in the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters
of the Ancients, more curious, and
which is yet less known to us.</p>
            <p>There is a certain difference, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
each Vice, or each Vertue is mark'd
by the particular impression it takes in
minds, where it is. For Example, the
Courage of <hi>Alcibiades</hi> hath something sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
in it, which distinguisheth it from
that of <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> although both knew
how to expose their lives equally. The
integrity of <hi>Cato</hi> is different from that of
<hi>Catulus;</hi> the boldness of <hi>Catiline</hi> is not the
same, as that of <hi>Anthony;</hi> the ambition of
<hi>Sylla,</hi> and that of <hi>Caesar</hi> have not a perfect
resemblance: from whence it comes that
the Ancients forming thereby the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters
of their Great Men, form, that I may
so speak, at the same time the Character
of the Qualities they give them, to the end
that they might appear not only Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and Daring, or Moderate and Prudent,
but that one might know more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
what was the kind of the Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and the Courage, or the Moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:44396:89"/>
and Prudence, which they had.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Salust</hi> describes <hi>Catiline</hi> to us, as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of a Wicked Nature, and the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of this nature is immediately expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed:
<hi>Sed ingenio malo pravoque.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The kind of his Ambition is distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the irregularity of his manners,
and the irregularity is mark'd in regard
of the Character of his Spirit by imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
too vast and too high: <hi>Vastus ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
immoderata, incredibilia, nimis alt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>He had a temper wicked enough to
enterprise all things against the Laws, and
too vast a Spirit to fix himself to designs,
proportioned to the means of making them
succeed.</p>
            <p>The bold Spirit of a Voluptuous and
Unchast Woman, such as <hi>Sempronia</hi> was,
might have made it believed that her bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
would have undertaken all things in
favour of her Amours: But as this sort of
confidence is little proper for dangers, to
which one is exposed in a Conspiracy, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lust</hi>
presently explains what she is capable
of doing, by what she had done before:
<hi>Quae multa saepe virilis <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> facinora com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miserat.</hi>
Behold the species of her boldness
expressed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:44396:89"/>He makes her Dance and Sing not with
the Fashions, Gestures, and Motions, which
the Singing and Dancing Women at <hi>Rome</hi>
used, but with more Art and Curiosity
than was decent for an honest Woman:
<hi>Psallere &amp; saltare elegantius quam necesse sit
probae.</hi> When he attributes to her a Wit
which you would value, he tells at the
same time wherein it consisted. <hi>Caeterum
ingenium ejus haud absurdum versus facere,
jocos movere, sermone uti vel modesto, vel
molli, vel procaci.</hi> You will know in the
Character of <hi>Sylla,</hi> that his Nature agreed
happily with his Designs. The Republick at
that time being divided into two Factions,
those that aspired to the power had no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Interest than to acquire Friends, and <hi>Sylla</hi>
had no greater pleasure than to make them.</p>
            <p>Liberality is the best means to gain Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.
<hi>Sylla</hi> knew how to give all things.
Amongst the things, which one gives,
there's nothing which enslaves Men more,
and assures so much their Services, as the
Money, which they receive of us. In
which the Liberality of <hi>Sylla</hi> was particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
exercised. <hi>Rerum omnium, pecuniae
maxime largitor.</hi> He was liberal of his own
Nature, liberal of his Money out of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:44396:90"/>His leisure was Voluptuous; but it had
not been giving a fine Character of this
Great Man, to have described him with
Sensuality or Laziness: which obliges <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lust</hi>
to mark the Character of the pleasure
of a Gentleman which yielded to Glory,
by whom Affairs are never retarded, for
fear one should come to suspect him of a
softness, wherein for the most part lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
the Effeminate. <hi>Voluptatum cupidus,
gloriae cupidior otio luxurioso esse, tamen a
negotiis nunquam voluptas remorata.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was the happiest Man of the World
before the Civil War, but this happiness
was not the pure effect of Chance; and
his Fortune, as great as it was always,
never was above his Industry. <hi>Atque illi
felicissi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

nunquam super industriam fortuna fuit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When <hi>Tacitus</hi> leaves us the description
of <hi>Petronius,</hi> he marks the qualities he
gives him, with these sorts of distinctions;
he makes him consume his Wealth not as
a profuse Man in Debauchery, but as a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate
Person, in a polite and curious
Luxury.</p>
            <p>The contempt of Death which he ascribes
to him, hath nothing common with that,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:44396:90"/>
which the other <hi>Romans</hi> had: It is not the
constant gravity of <hi>Thraseas,</hi> giving In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
to him that brought him the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to Die; it is not the forc'd constancy
of <hi>Seneca,</hi> who has occasion to encourage
himself by the remembrance of his own
Precepts and Discourses; it is not that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
firmess, which <hi>Helvidius</hi> spurs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
on with; it is not a resolution form'd
upon the Opinions of Philosophers; it is a
soft and careless indifference, which left in
his Soul no room for the fatal thoughts of
Death; it is a continuation of the ordinary
course of his Life to the last moment. But
if the Ancients had so much curiousness in
marking these distinctions, there is not less
Art in the stile of their Characters to tye
our judgment to the knowledge of them.</p>
            <p>In their Narrations they engage us to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
them by the insensible bond of an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
and natural recital. They attract
our minds in their Orations, by the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestness
of discourse, fearing if our Spirits
were not moved out of their place, they
should examine the little Judgment there
is in the amplifications of Eloquence, and
should have the opportunity of forming
secret oppositions to the being perswaded.
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:44396:91"/>
Sometimes they bring in a Council Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
upon Reasons to determine Souls unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to the party, which they ought to
take. But in Characters where one should
discern Vices and Vertues, where one
should discover the differences which meet
in one Nature, where one should not only
distinguish the different qualities, but the
differences whereby each quality is marked,
one ought not to make use of a stile
which engages us, or draws us in, nor of
Arguments one upon another, which should
put ours in subjection. On the contrary
one ought to disengage us from every thing
that draws us on, from every thing that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
on us, from every thing that enslaves
our understanding, to the end of leaving
us with our selves is a full use of our own
understanding, tied notwithstanding, as
much as it is possible for us, to every term
of a compendious stile, and a various con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
for fear the mind should come
to disperse it self in too rambling conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
            <p>By that a Reader is obliged to give his
utmost attention to divers singularities,
and to examine separately each feature of
the Picture.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:44396:91"/>'Tis thus the Ancients formed their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters.
As for us, if so be we were to
describe a Nature, like that of <hi>Catiline,</hi>
we should be troubled to conceive in one
and the same person, qualities which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to be opposite.</p>
            <p>So much boldness with so great Artifice,
so much fierceness and so much Policy, so
much Ardour in what he desired, with so
much Fraud and Dissimulation.</p>
            <p>There are nice differences between qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
which seem to be the same, which
we have much ado to discover.</p>
            <p>There is sometimes a mixture of Vice
and Vertue in one single quality, which
we never truely separate. It is easie for us
to know Vertues, when they are pure and
entire; and for the most part we give pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in Counsels, promptness in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and valour in Battels.</p>
            <p>As for what regards good Manners, Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
towards God, Honesty towards Men,
and Fidelity to his Friends, and to his
Master.</p>
            <p>We make the same use both of Defects
and Vices; of Incapacity in Affairs, of
Cowardice against Enemies, of Infidelity
to his Friends, of Idleness, Avarice and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude:
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:44396:92"/>
But where Nature hath not
put a great purity in Vertues, where she
has left some mixture of Vertue amongst
Vices, we want sometimes a penetration
to discover what lyes concealed, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
a curiousness to dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>entangle what is
confused.</p>
            <p>These particular distinctions, which va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
mark the qualities according to the
Spirits, where they meet, are yet more
obscure to us. The diversity of Valour is
unknown to us; we have but one Courage
for all the Valiant Men, one Ambition for
all the Ambitious; and to speak the truth,
the Character, which we make of a Person
of great Desert, might agree to every thing
that has been given to the Great Persons of
our Time.</p>
            <p>If so be we were to speak of those Dukes
of <hi>Guise,</hi> whose Reputation is Eternal, we
should Entitle them, Valiant, Generous,
Courteous, Liberal, Ambitious, Zealous
for the Catholick Religion, and declared
Enemies of the Protestant; but the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the one too little distinguished from
those of the other, would not form the
Characters as different as they should
be.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:44396:92"/>Those Vertues, which Morality and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Discourses represent to us to be the same,
take a different Air by the difference of the
Humour and Genius of the Persons that
have them.</p>
            <p>We judge well that the Constable, and
the Admiral have been capable of sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Burthen of the most important
Affairs; but the difference of their capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
is not sufficiently marked in our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.</p>
            <p>The Courage of the <hi>Mareschal de Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillon</hi>
was a slow and negligent stoutness.
That of the <hi>Mareschal de la Meilleraye</hi> had
a Fervency very proper to press a Siege,
and a Passion, which disordered him in
Field-fights.</p>
            <p>The Valour of the <hi>Marechal de Ranzau</hi>
was admirable for great Actions; it could
save a Province, it could preserve an Army:
But one would have said that it esteemed
common dangers below it self, to have
seen it so careless in little and frequent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions,
where common Parts could have
done the Business.</p>
            <p>That of the <hi>Marechal de Gassion,</hi> more
lively and active, might have been useful
at all moments; there was not a day,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:44396:93"/>
wherein it gave not to our Troops some ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
over the Enemies. It is true that
it was less free at the sight of something
that was weighty. This <hi>Marechal</hi> who
had ventured so much in falling upon Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
so brisk in charging the Rear of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
fear'd an entire Engagement, being
Occupied with the thoughts of Events,
when it was more necessary to act than to
think.</p>
            <p>Sometimes we insist wholly upon Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
without having regard to what
Humour mixes therein. Sometimes we
give too much to Humour, and don't con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
enough the depth of Qualities.</p>
            <p>The Meditation of Monsieur <hi>de Turenne,</hi>
his Spirit retired into himself, full of his
Projects, and his Conduct, have made him
pass for timerous, irresolute and uncertain,
altho' he gave Battel with as much easiness,
as Monsieur <hi>de Gassion</hi> went to a Skirmish.
And the Natural heat of the Prince of
<hi>Conde</hi> made him thought impetuous in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels;
He, that was Master of himself more
than any Person in the World in the heat
of Action, He, that had more presence of
Mind at <hi>Lens, Fribourg, Norlingue,</hi> and
<hi>Senef,</hi> than he would have had perhaps in
his Closet.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:44396:93"/>After so long a Discourse upon the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Men, I will affirm that our Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
don't give us enough of it, for want
of Application or Judgment to know them
well.</p>
            <p>They imagined that an exact recital of
Events sufficed to instruct us, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
that Affairs are done by Men,
whom Passion oftner transports, than Po<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>licy
conducts them.</p>
            <p>Prudence governs the Wise; but there
is but a few of them, and the most Wise
are not so at all times: Passion agitates al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
the whole World, and almost al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways.</p>
            <p>In States, where the Maxims of true In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
ought to be better followed, one see<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
the greatest part of things acted by a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Faction, and all Factions are passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate;
Passion is found every where, the
Zeal of the best Persons is not exempt
from it.</p>
            <p>The Animosity of <hi>Cato</hi> against <hi>Caesar,</hi> the
Fury of <hi>Cicero</hi> against <hi>Anthony</hi> have not
been less serviceable to the Ruin of Liberty,
than the Ambition of those, who have
Established Tyranny.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:44396:94"/>The Opposition of two Great Men, equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but differently Zealous for the good of
<hi>Holland,</hi> have been very near destroying of
it, when it had no more to fear from the
<hi>Spaniards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> would have it powerful
abroad; <hi>Bernaveld</hi> would have it free at
home. The first put it in a condition to
support it self against a King of <hi>Spain:</hi>
The second sought to assure it against a
Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It cost <hi>Bernaveld</hi> his Life, and that
which frequently enough happens, one
saw the Partisans of Liberty even Ruined
by the People.</p>
            <p>I pass from Observations upon History,
to Reflections upon Politicks: Perhaps I
may be pardoned for it; whatever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens,
I shall satisfie my self.</p>
            <p>In the beginnings of a Republick, the
love of Liberty is the chief Vertue of the
Citizens, and the Jealousie which it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spires,
establishes the principal Policy of
the State.</p>
            <p>As weary as Men are of the troubles,
perplexities and dangers, which they must
endure to live always Independent, they
follow any Ambitious Man, that pleases
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:44396:94"/>
them, and fall easily from a troublesome
Liberty, to an agreeable Subjection.</p>
            <p>I remember that I have often said in
<hi>Holland,</hi> and even to the Pensioner, that
Men were mistaken in the Nature of the
<hi>Hollanders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One is perswaded, that the <hi>Hollanders</hi>
love Liberty, and they only hate Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
There is with them more roughness
in the Mind, than fierceness in the Soul,
and the fierceness of the Soul makes the
true Republicans. One would be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive
there of a Covetous Prince, capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of taking away their Estates; a Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Prince, that might be outragious to
them: But they agree to the Quality of
Prince with Pleasure.</p>
            <p>If so be they love the Republick, 'tis for
the Interest of their Traffick, more than
through a satisfaction, they have in being
free.</p>
            <p>The Magistrates love to be Independent,
to govern those that depend on them:
The People would more easily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the Authority of the Prince, than
that of the Magistrates.</p>
            <p>When a Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> had a design to
surprize <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> all declared for the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:44396:95"/>
               <hi>Burgo-Masters,</hi> but that was more through
a hatred of Violence, than a love of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
            <p>When another opposed a Peace, after
a long War, there was a Peace made in
spite of him: But it was done through a
sense of the present misery; and the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
consideration, which they had for him,
is but suspended, not destroyed.</p>
            <p>These extraordinary stroaks being passed
over, they return to the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi>
The Republicans are displeased to see the
people take up their first Affections, and
they apprehend a Dominion, without da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to appear jealous of Liberty.</p>
            <p>When the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> had neither
Charge, nor Government, when he had
no Credit but by his Name, the Pensioner
and Monsieur <hi>de Nordhuis</hi> were the only
Persons, that durst boldly pronounce the
word Republick at the <hi>Hague.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Family of <hi>Orange</hi> had other Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
enough; but these Enemies always
spoke of States with general Expressions,
which did not explain the Constitution of
the Government.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Holland</hi> (says <hi>Grotius</hi>) is a Republick
made by chance, which maintains it self
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:44396:95"/>
by the fear they conceive of the <hi>Spaniards,
Respublica casu facta, quam metus Hispano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
continet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Apprehension, which the <hi>French</hi>
now-a-days give them, produceth the same
effect; and the necessity of a good Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
unites the Prince to the States, and
the States to the Prince.</p>
            <p>But to judge of things by themselves,
<hi>Holland</hi> is neither free, nor subject. 'Tis
a Government made up of pieces very
slightly fastned, where the Power of the
Prince, and the Liberty of the Citizens
have an equal necessity for Stratagems to
preserve it.</p>
            <p>Let us come now to what regards the
Courts, and make Reflection upon the
Effects that Passions occasion there.</p>
            <p>In what Court have not the Women had
Credit, and in what Intrigues are not they
concerned?</p>
            <p>What hath not the Princess of <hi>Eboly</hi> done
under <hi>Philip</hi> the Second, as Prudent and
Politick as he was?</p>
            <p>And the Countess of <hi>Carlisle,</hi> from the
most inward part of <hi>Whitehall,</hi> did not she
animate all the Factions of <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:44396:96"/>'Tis a Consolation for us to find our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities
in those, that have the Authority
to govern us; and a great delight to those,
that are distinguished by Power, to be

            <head>REFLECTIONS
UPON THE
FRENCH Translators.</head>
            <p>THE Works of our Translators are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
esteemed throughout the
World. 'Tis not the very exact fidelity,
that recommends our <hi>Ablancour:</hi> But one
must admire the agreeable force of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
where there is neither harshness,
nor obscurity. You will find therein not
a term to be desired for the purity of Sense,
nothing to be rejected, nothing of super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity,
nothing that's displeasing to us.
Every word is there measured for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actness
of periods, without the stile's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
less natural; and yet a Syllable
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:44396:96"/>
more or less would ruin, I know, any Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
which is as agreeable to the Ear,
as that of Verse. But, in my Opinion,
he holds the Obligation of these advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
to the discourse of the Ancients,
which rules his own; for so soon as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
from their Genius to his own, as in
his Prefaces and Letters, he loseth the best
part of all these Beauties: And he who is
an admirable Author, whilst he is anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the Spirit of the Greeks and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins,
becomes but a moderate Writer,
when he is not supported, but by himself.
'Tis that which happens with the greatest
part of our Translators; whereof they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to me to be convinced, to be first sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of their own Barrenness. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
he that places his Merit in improving
the Thoughts of others, is not very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
of being capable to recommend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
by his own: But the Publick is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obliged to him for the labour he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes
to bring forth Forreign Riches, where
the natural ones don't suffice: I am not
of the Humour of a Person of Quality,
whom I know to be a declared Enemy to
all Translations. He is a Learned and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
<hi>Spaniard,</hi> who cannot suffer that
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:44396:97"/>
things should be rendred apprehensive to
Idle Persons, which he has learned amongst
the Ancients with pains. As for me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
that I improve in a thousand places by
the Laborious Enquiries of Translators, I
love that the knowledge of Antiquity
should become more general, and I am
pleased in seeing his Authors admired by
those very Persons, that would have trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
us as Pedants, if so be we had named
them, when they did not understand them.
I mix then my knowledge with that of the
Publick, but I don't give my esteem, and
can be very liberal of my praises for Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation,
when I shall be very covetous of
them for the Genius of its Author. I can
much esteem the Versions of <hi>Ablancour,
Vaugelas, Durier,</hi> and many others, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
having much value for their Spirits;
if they have not appeared by those Works
that proceed from themselves.</p>
            <p>We have the Versions of two Latin
Poems in <hi>French</hi> Verse, which deserve to
be as much considered for their Beauty,
as for the difficulty of the Enterprize. That
of <hi>Brebaeuf</hi> has been generally esteemed,
and I am not so censorious, or so severe,
as to oppose my self to so favourable an
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:44396:97"/>
Approbation. I will observe, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
that he hath shot forth the heat
of <hi>Lucan</hi> in our Language, further than it
goes in his own; and that by the attempt
which he hath made, to equal the warmth
of this Poem, he hath fired himself, if one
may speak so, much more. Behold, what
happens to <hi>Brebaeuf</hi> often enough, but he
relaxeth sometimes; and when <hi>Lucan</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
meets with the true beauty of a
Thought, the Translator remains much
below him, as if he had a mind to appear
easie and natural, when he might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to employ all his Force.</p>
            <p>You will remark a hundred times the
truth of my first Observation, and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
will not appear to you less just in some
places; for example, to render <hi>Victrix cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa
Diis placuit, sed victa Catoni.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brebuaef</hi> has only said, the Gods serve
<hi>Caesar,</hi> and <hi>Cato</hi> follows <hi>Pompey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis a low Expression, which doth not
answer to the Nobleness of the <hi>Latine;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
that it is not well using the Sense of
the Author: for <hi>Lucan,</hi> who hath a Spirit
full of the Vertue of <hi>Cato,</hi> would raise him
above the Gods, in the opposition of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
upon the merit of the Cause; and
<hi>Breb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uf</hi> turns a noble Image of <hi>Cato</hi> raised
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:44396:98"/>
above the Gods, into that of <hi>Cato</hi> subjected
to <hi>Pompey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for <hi>Segrais,</hi> he remains throughout
much below <hi>Virgil,</hi> which he easily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges
himself; for it would be very
extraordinary, to be able to render a Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
equal to so excellent an Original:
Moreover, one of the greatest advantages
of the Poet consists in the Beauty of the
Expression, which it is impossible to equal
in our Language, since it could never be
done in his own.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Segrais</hi> ought to be contented with ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
found the Genius of <hi>Virgil,</hi> better
than any of our Authors; and whatsoever
Graces the <hi>Aeneids</hi> have lost in his hands, I
durst pronounce, that he, by far surpasses
all those Poems, that our French-men have
published with more Confidence than Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess.</p>
            <p>The great Application of <hi>Segrais,</hi> to
know the Genius of the Poet, appears in his
Preface, as well as in the Translation, and
it seems to me, that he has succeeded well,
as to the whole, except the Characters. In
that I cannot be of his Opinion, and he
will pardon me, if, for having been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas'd
a thousand times with his Heroe, I
do not lose the occasion of speaking here,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:44396:98"/>
of the little merit of the good <hi>Aeneas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although Conquerors are usually more
careful in making their Orders executed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Earth, than in observing Religiously,
those of Heaven; as <hi>Italy</hi> was promised
to this <hi>Trojan</hi> by the Gods, 'tis with Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
that <hi>Virgil</hi> has given him a great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
to their Wills; but when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes
him to us so devout, he ought to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
to him a Devotion full of Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
which agrees with the Constitution
of Heroes, not a scrupulous Sentiment of
Religion, which never subsists with a true
Valour.</p>
            <p>A General, that has a good Faith in his
Gods, ought to augment the greatness of
his Courage, by the hopes of their As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance:
His Condition were unhappy, if
he could not believe in them, but with a
Superstition, which would take away the
natural use of his Understanding, and his
Heart. 'Tis this that happened to poor
<hi>Nicias,</hi> who lost the Army of the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
and himself too, by a credulous, and
superstitious Opinion of the Anger of the
Gods. It is not so with the Great <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
he believes himself to be the Son of
<hi>Iupiter,</hi> to undertake things very extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary.
<hi>Scipio,</hi> who feigns, or thinks to
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:44396:99"/>
have a commerce with the Gods, draws an
advantage from thence, to recover his
Common-wealth, and to pull down that
of the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> Ought then the Son
of <hi>Venus,</hi> assured by <hi>Iupiter,</hi> of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity,
and future Glory, to have Piety
only to fear Danger, and to distrust the
Success of every Undertaking? <hi>Segrais</hi>
hereupon defends a Cause, which is
troublesome to him, and has so much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
for his Heroe, that he prefers ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
not to express the Sense of <hi>Virgil</hi> in all
its extent, than to discover purely, the
shameful Fears of poor <hi>Aeneas.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <l>Extemplo Aeneae solvuntur frigore membra,</l>

               <l>Talia voce refert; ô terque, quaterque beati,</l>
               <l>Queis ante or a patrum Trojae submaenibus altis</l>
               <l>Contigit oppetere.</l>
            </q>
            <p>I acknowledge, that these sorts of Sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zures
happen to us in spite of our selves, by
a defect of Constitution: but since <hi>Virgil</hi>
had the liberty of framing that of <hi>Aeneas</hi>
according to his Fancy, I admire that he
should give him one susceptible of these
Frights. Philosophers take a Pride in the
defects of Tempers, when they know how
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:44396:99"/>
to correct them by Wisdom: And <hi>Socrates</hi>
easily confesses those evil Inclinations,
which Philosophy had made him overcome.
But Nature ought to be all noble in Heroes;
and if by a necessity of Humane Condition,
it must offend in something, their Reason
is employed in moderating Transports, not
in surmounting Infirmities, even many
times their impulses have something of
Divine, which is above Reason; that which
is called Irregularity in others, is in them
but a full Liberty, where their Souls dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play
themselves in their utmost Extent;
one makes of their Impetuosity, that He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick
Vertue, which transports our Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
without our Judgments being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in it.</p>
            <p>But mean Passions dishonour them, and
if so be, Friendship exacts from them, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
Fears and Afflictions, (like those of
<hi>Achilles</hi> for <hi>Patroclus,</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> for
<hi>Hephestion,)</hi> it is not permitted them in
their own Dangers, and their particular
Misfortunes, neither to shew the same Fear,
nor to discover the same Complaints. But
<hi>Aeneas</hi> knew how to Fear, and lament up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
every thing that concerned himself. It
is true, that he doth the same thing for his
Friends; but one ought to attribute it less
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:44396:100"/>
to a noble and generous Passion, than to an
inexhaustible source of Apprehensions and
Tears, which furnish'd him naturally there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
both for himself, and others.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Extemplo Aeneae solvuntur frigore membra,</l>
               <l>Ingemit, &amp; duplices tendens ad syder a palmas.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Seized as he is with this Coldness through
all his Members, the first argument of Life,
which he gives, is to groan; then he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
his hands to Heaven, and in all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
would implore its Succour, if so
be the State, wherein is the good Heroe,
would afford him the strength to elevate
his Spirit to the Gods, and to have some at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
to Prayer. His Soul, which could
not apply it self to any thing, abandons it
self to Lamentations; and like to those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate
Widows, who desire to be dead with
their Husbands, say they, upon the first
trouble they meet with, <hi>The poor</hi> Aeneas <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wails,
in that he did not perish before</hi> Troy,
<hi>with</hi> Hector, <hi>and esteems them very happy,
who left their Bones in the Bosom of so sweet,
and so dear a Country.</hi> Another will believe,
that 'tis to envy their Happiness; I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded,
that it is for fear of the Danger
that threatens him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:44396:100"/>You will observe still, that all these La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations
begin almost as soon as the
Tempest.</p>
            <p>The Winds blow impetuously, the Air
is darkned, it Thunders, it Lightens, the
Waves grow larger and more furious; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
what happens in all Tempests. Yet
there is neither Mast broken, nor Sails torn
to pieces, no Oars dash'd in two, nor Rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
lost, no Leak made, whereby the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
might enter into the Ship; this is the
time when one ought to be Afflicted: For
there are a thousand young Lads in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and as many Women in <hi>Holland,</hi> who
would hardly be amazed, where the Heroe
shews his Despair.</p>
            <p>I find one thing remarkable in the <hi>Aeneids,</hi>
it is, That the Gods abandon wholly to <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas,</hi>
all the subject Matters of Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Let him speak of the Destruction of
<hi>Troy</hi> as pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>fully as he will, they won't in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfere
to moderate his Tears: but as soon
as there's a great Resolution to take, or an
Execution difficult to perform, they don't
trust to his Capacity, nor to his Courage,
and they do even at all times what other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
great Men have been used to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take,
and execute themselves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:44396:101"/>I know how much the intervention of the
Gods is necessary to an Epick Poem: but
that doth not hinder, that one ought to
leave more things to the Valour of the
Heroe; for if the Heroe is too confident,
who in contempt of the Gods, will found
all upon himself; the God is too favourable,
who, to perform all, quite takes off from
the Merit of the Heroe.</p>
            <p>No body better understood this delicate
management of the Assistance of Heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and the Courage of great Men, than <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginus.
Ajax,</hi> says he, finding himself in
a Battel, in a horrible dark Night, doth
not ask <hi>Iupiter</hi> to save him from the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
he was in; that had been unworthy
of him. He doth not ask of him a superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Strength to overcome with Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
then he should have too little a share in
the Victory. He only begs for Light, that
he might be able to discern his Enemies,
and to exercise against them his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Valour, <hi>Da lucem ut videam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The greatest fault of the <hi>Pharsalia</hi> is,
That it is properly but a History in Verse,
where illustrious Men perform almost all
things by Methods purely Humane. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronius</hi>
blames him for it with Reason, and
remarks judiciously, That <hi>per ambages De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orumque
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:44396:101"/>
ministerium, &amp; fabulosum senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiarum
tormentum praecipitandus est liber spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus,
ut potius furentis animi vaticinatio, appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reat,
quàm religiosa orationis sub testibus fides.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>Aeneids</hi> is an Eternal Fable,
where the Gods are introduced to manage,
and execute all things. As for the good
<hi>Aeneas,</hi> he hardly concerns himself in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant,
and glorious Designs. It suffices
him not to be wanting in the Offices of a
pious, tender, and compassionate Soul. He
carries his Father on his Shoulders, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugally
laments his dear <hi>Creusa;</hi> he causes
his Nurse to be Enterred, and makes a Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Pile for his Pilot, in shedding a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Tears.</p>
            <p>This was a poor Heroe in <hi>Paganism,</hi> that
might be a great Saint amongst the <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
very proper to afford us Miracles, and
a more worthy Founder of an Order, than
a State.</p>
            <p>To consider him through the Sentiments
of Religion, I can reverence his Sanctity.
If so be I would judge of him by those of
Glory, I should not suffer a Conquerour,
that furnisheth himself with nothing but
Tears in Misfortunes, and Fears at all Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
that happen. I cannot suffer that he
should be rendred Master of so delicious a
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:44396:102"/>
Country, as <hi>Italy,</hi> with Qualities that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
better to lose his own, than to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
that of another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Virgil,</hi> in my Opinion, was undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
very pitiful. He doth not make the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate
<hi>Trojans</hi> complain of so many misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
but by a secret Inclination he found
in himself to be compassionate. If he had
not been of that constitution, he would not
have given to the good <hi>Aeneas</hi> so great an
Affection for his dear Countrey; for He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes
easily part with the remembrance of
their Countrey in Nat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ons, where they
ought to perform great matters. Their
Souls quite turn'd to Glory, preserve no
Sentiment for those trifling Delights.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Trojans</hi> then should have been less
afflicted for their Misery: Warlike Men
that would excite our pity for their Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
inspire nothing but contempt for
their weakness. But <hi>Aeneas</hi> particularly
ought to have been taken up with his great
design, and to have turned his Thoughts
from what he had su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fered, upon the Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment
he was going to make: He, that
went to found the greatness and vertue of
the <hi>Romans,</hi> ought to have an Elevation,
and a Magnanimity worthy of them.</p>
            <p>In other things, <hi>Segrais</hi> could not give
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:44396:102"/>
too many commendations of the <hi>Aeneids,</hi>
and perhaps I am pleas'd with the fourth
and sixth Books, more than he is himself
with the Characters. I acknowledge that
they don't affect me, and I find those of
<hi>Homer</hi> as enlivening, as those of <hi>Virgil</hi> are
flat and insipid.</p>
            <p>Indeed, there is no Soul, which is not
elevated by the impression, that the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of <hi>Achilles</hi> makes upon it.</p>
            <p>There is none, to whom the impetuous
Courage of <hi>Ajax</hi> doth not give some mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of impatience. There is none but is
animated, and excited by the Valour of
<hi>Diomedes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is no person, in whom the Rank
and gravity of <hi>Agamemnon</hi> doth not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print
some respect; who hath not a vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
for the long Experience and Wisdom
of <hi>Nestor;</hi> in whom the advised industry
of the Sub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>le and Ingenious <hi>Vlysses</hi> doth not
raise the Imagination. The Unfortunate
Valour of <hi>Hector</hi> makes him lamented by
the whole World; the miserable conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of old King <hi>Priam</hi> touches the most ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate
Soul; and although Beauty hath as
it were a secret priviledge of reconciling
the Affections to it, that of <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Hele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
attracts nothing but indignation, when
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:44396:103"/>
one considers the Blood she caus'd to be
spilt, and the fatal Misfortunes she was
the occasion of.</p>
            <p>Of whatsoever manner it is, all Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates
in <hi>Homer,</hi> all is Affecting; but in
<hi>Virgil,</hi> who is not tired with the good <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas,</hi>
and his dear <hi>Achates?</hi> If you except
<hi>Nisus,</hi> and <hi>Euryalus,</hi> who, indeed, in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

an <hi>Ilioneus, a Sergestes Mnestheus, Cloantes,
Gias,</hi> and the rest of those ordinary Men,
that accompany an indifferent Leader<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Judge by that, how much we ought to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
the Poetry of <hi>Virgil,</hi> since in spite of
the Courage of the <hi>Heroes</hi> of <hi>Homer,</hi> and
the little merit of his own, he is, it may
be preferable to him, or assuredly, is not
his Inferiour.</p>

            <head>Some Observations
UPON THE
Tast and Iudgment of the French.</head>
            <p>ALthough the ordinary Genius of the
<hi>French</hi> appears indifferent enough,
it is certain, that those, who distinguish
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:44396:103"/>
themselves amongst us, are capable of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
the finest things: But when they
know how to compo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

loss how to esteem them; and if so be, we
have rendred Justice to some excellent
Work, our Distast, or our Levity, doth
not suffer it long to enjoy the Reputation,
we have given it.</p>
            <p>I don't much wonder, that a good Sense
of things is not found in places where Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity
Reigns, and that there is no Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
where Letters, Arts, and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plines
are lost; it would be ridiculous too,
to search for so exquisite a Light in certain
times of Weakness and Ignorance: but
that which is surprising, is, to see in a
most Polite Court, a good and evil Sense,
a true and false Genius succeed turn by
turn <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I have seen considerable Men sometimes
pass for the Ornaments of the Court, and
immediately held ridiculous; to be liked
again, then fall into Contempt, without
any alteration, either in their Persons, or
their Conduct.</p>
            <p>A Man retires with the Applause of the
whole World, who, the next day finds
himself the Subject of Raillery, without
knowing what might become of the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:44396:104"/>
which was had of his Merit. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of it is, That one rarely Judges of Men
by solid Advantages, which is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of good Sense; but by Measures,
whose Applause finisheth, as soon as the
Fancy, which produced them. The works
of Authors are subject to the same inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of our Judgment. When I was young,
<hi>Theophile</hi> was admired, in spite of his Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularities,
and Negligence, which esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
through the little Curiosity of the
Courtiers of that time. I have seen him
since Cried down by all the Versifiers, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any respect to his fine Imagination, and
the happy Graces of his Genius.</p>
            <p>I have seen the Poetry of <hi>Malherbe</hi>
thought admirable in the Turn, Exactness,
and Expression. <hi>Malherbe</hi> a little after was
neglected, as the last of Poets, Fancy ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
turned the <hi>French</hi> to Riddles, Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesque,
and unfinished Verses.</p>
            <p>I have seen all the World exclaim a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Pucelle</hi> of <hi>Chapellain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have seen our Judgments returned from
an Error of Surprise, to fail.</p>
            <p>I have seen then a Conspiracy, which
was made to render it ridiculous, without
distinguishing what it might have of Good,
from what it had of Bad.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:44396:104"/>I have seen <hi>Corneille</hi> lose his Reputation,
if it were possible for him to lose it, at the
representation of one his best pieces.</p>
            <p>I have seen the two best <hi>Comedians</hi> of the
World exposed to all our Railleries; and
the influence of this false Spirit being pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
they made themselves admired, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
through a happy return of our good
Sense.</p>
            <p>The Airs of <hi>Boisset,</hi> which heretofore so
justly charmed all the Court, were soon
left for little Songs; and <hi>Luigi,</hi> the first
Man of the Universe in his Art, must come
from <hi>Italy</hi> to admire them, to make us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
of this abandoning, and to give up to
them again the Reputation, which a meer
Fancy had taken from them.</p>
            <p>If so be you ask the Reason of it, I will
tell you, that Industry in <hi>France</hi> holds the
place of the greatest Merit, and that the
Art of making himself esteemed, oftner,
gives a Rep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tation, than the thing it self.</p>
            <p>As good Judges are as rare as good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors;
as it is as difficult to find the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in one, as the Genius in the t'other;
every one aiming to give a Reputation to
that which pleases him, it happens, that
the Multitude values that which is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to their ill Judgment, or at most, to
their moderate Understanding.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:44396:105"/>Add, That the novelty thereof is a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
to us, from which our Minds can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
easily defend themselves. The Merit
which we are accustomed to, forms with
time an envious Habi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and the defects are
capable of surprising us agreeably, in what
we never saw.</p>
            <p>The most valuable things, which have
long appeared amongst us, make no more
Impres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ions, as good; they bring a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tast,
as old. Those on the other side,
which deserve no Esteem, are less rejected
as despicable, than sought after, as New.</p>
            <p>Not, but that there are in <hi>France</hi> very
found Minds, which never dislike any thing
that ought to please, and are never pleas'd
with what is distastful: but the Multitude
either ignorant, or prepossess'd, stifles the
small number of those that are knowing.</p>
            <p>Besides, Persons of the greatest Figure
make every thing valued according to their
Fancy, and when a person is <hi>Alamode,</hi> he
may equally esteem those things he knows,
and those he doth not.</p>
            <p>There is no Country, where Reason is
more rare, than it is in <hi>France;</hi> when it is
found there, there is not a purer in the
World.</p>
            <p>For the most part all is Fancy, but a
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:44396:105"/>
Fancy so fine, and a Capricio so noble, in
what regards the outside, that Strangers
ashamed of their Judgment, as of a gross
Quality, seek to make themselves esteemed
amongst them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the imitation of our
Modes, and renounce Essential Qualities,
to affect an Air, and Ways, which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
possible for them to invent. Thus that
continual alteration in our Habits, which
they reproach us with, and is always fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
becomes insensibly a very great
piece of Wisdom; for, besides, infinit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
sums of Money which we draw from
thence, 'tis an Interest more solid than is
imagined, to have French Men dispersed
throughout, who form the outside of all
People by our own; who begin by ensla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Eyes, when the Heart is still op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to our Laws; who gain the Senses in
favour of our Government, when the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
hold still for Liberty.</p>
            <p>Happy then is that Fancy, Noble, and
Genteel, which makes it self accepted by
our greatest Enemies; but we ought to lay
aside our claim to that, which would rule
in Arts, and which imperiously decides the
Prod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

either good Tast, or Reason.</p>
            <p>When we are arrived to the perfection
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:44396:106"/>
of any thing, we ought to fix our Curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in the knowledge of it, and the Justice
we owe thereto, in our Eternal Esteem of
it; without that we may be reproached
upon good Grounds, that Strangers more
justly value the merit of our Works, than
our selves.</p>
            <p>We shall see the good things, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from us, preserve their Reputation
elsewhere, when they have lost it in <hi>France:</hi>
We shall see our Fopperies elsewhere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
by good Sense, when we extol them
up to Heaven out of a ridiculous Conceit.</p>
            <p>There is a Vice opposed to that, which
is no more supportable, that is our passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Affection, for what is done in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

every thing that's done in that we live.</p>

               <hi>Horace</hi> thereupon made the Character of
old Age, and an old Man is, indeed, admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably

            </q>
            <p>In this sad and unhappy Age we impute
to Objects, the defects which proceed purely
from our Moroseness; and when a pleasant
Remembrance turns our Thoughts from
what we are, to what we have been, we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:44396:106"/>
Agreements to many things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which
had none, because they recall in our Minds
the Idea of our Youth, when every thing
pleased us by the disposition of our Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>But we ought not to impute this Humour
to old Age alone, there are some persons,
who imagine, that Merit consists in despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
every thing that is New, and Solidity,
in valuing all the old Works.</p>
            <p>There are those, who, of their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
are discontented with what they see,
and amorous of what they have seen.</p>
            <p>They will tell you wonders of an old
Court, where there was nothing but indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
in contempt of the Grandeur, and
Magnificence, which they have before
their Eyes.</p>
            <p>They will give a thousand Praises to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased
Persons of but a common Vertue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and will hardly dispense with the Glory of
the greatest Heroe, if alive.</p>
            <p>The first Obstacle to their Esteem, is to
Live, the most favourable Recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is to have been. They will praise af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Death of a Man, what they blamed
in him, whilst alive; and their Spirit, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engaged
from the moroseness of their Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
will justly render to his Memory,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:44396:107"/>
what it unjustly robbed his Person
of.</p>
            <p>I was always of Opinion, That to make
a sound Judgment of Men, and of their
Works, it is necessary to consider them by
themselves, to have a Contempt, or a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
for things past according to their little
Worth, or their Desert. Iimagined that one
ought not to oppose Novelties through a
Spirit of Aversion, nor to enquire after
them through a love of Novelty; but to
reject, or receive them according to the
true Opinion, one ought to conceive of
th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m, we ought to part with our Capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio's,
and all the fantasticalness of our Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
which yet is but a hindrance to
know things well.</p>
            <p>The most essential point is to acquire a
true Judgment, and to get a pure Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.</p>
            <p>Nature prepares us to it, Experience and
Conversation with delicate Persons, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleats
us therein.</p>

In Persons altogether Corrupted.
The Corrupted Speaks.</head>
            <p>I Have passed, Gentlemen, through all
conditions, and after an exact Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
upon Life, I find but two things that
can solidly employ a Wise Man, the care
of getting, and that of hoarding.</p>
            <p>Honour is but a conceit of Young Men;
'tis by that one begins his Reputation, when
he is a Fool, and he concludes it by that
which is called Corruption, so soon as he
is Wise.</p>
            <p>As for me, I never had a Spirit stained
with this Chimera. Duty, Friendship,
Gratitude, and the rest of those Errors,
which make the Bonds of Sot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s and Fools,
have not caus'd me a moments trouble in
all my Life.</p>
            <p>Nature brought me forth with the true
Genius of Interest, which I have improved
by Study, and fortified by Experience.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="198" facs="tcp:44396:108"/>Greediness, which causes the same effect
for Wealth, as Ambition doth for power,
hath raised me to great advantages, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
making me fall into the carelesness of
small Gains.</p>
            <p>One gets in a hundred different methods,
which are as so many different products of
our Industry.</p>
            <p>It would be a difficult thing to give the
particulars thereof; but one shall never be
deceived, if so be he holds for a principal
Maxim, to prefer the profitable before the
honest: To apply himself to the profitable,
is to follow the Intention of Nature, which
by a secret Instinct carries us to what is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to us, and obliges us to refer all
things to our Selves.</p>
            <p>Honour is an Imaginary Duty, which
for the consideration of another, makes us
abstain from those good things, that we
might enjoy, or part with those which we
should retain.</p>
            <p>As for what relates to hoarding, is it not
just to manage with care, what we have
procured with difficulty? As long as we
have Money in our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>offers, we shall have
Friends, and humble Servants: If so be we
exhaust it by a vain liberality, we shall but
give Men the liberty to be ungrateful, losing
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:44396:108"/>
that which certainly draws them to us, to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ye them again to themselves.</p>
            <p>There are but a few acknowledging Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and when we can meet with any, it
is certain that the price of Gratitude very
rarely comes near that of Benefit.</p>
            <p>There is one thing of great use, which I
have happily practised; it is, Gentlemen,
to promise eternally, and very rarely to
give. One reaps more Services by Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
than by Presents. For Men put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in a state of deserving, what they
hope from us: And they are but just bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contented with what they receive, who
make it pass for a recompence of their pains,
or for an effect of their Industry. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
amongst the ungrateful, these appear
to me less dangerous, because they unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
us immediately, and cannot put us
to the expence of above one Gift.</p>
            <p>You will find those, that are much
more to be fear'd, who preach to us the
good which is done them, so far as to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune
the whole World. They have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
the Name of their Benefactor in their
Mouths, and his Picture in their Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers;
but what proceeds from this vain
appearance of acknowledgment?</p>
            <p>They frame to themselves a Title for a
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:44396:109"/>
new pretension, and whilst you think they
are employed about returning the favour,
which they have received, they think they
have rendred themselves worthy of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which they are not wanting to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest.</p>
            <p>Fine subtilty of our days, to have turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Gratitude from the future side, that,
which had not been hitherto but the Sense
of a passed Obligation.</p>
            <p>As you are to live with Persons, that
make designs upon you; 'tis your business
to take cautions against them; and instead
of discovering the good and evil Intentions
by the curiousness of Judgment, I find it
necessary to secure your Self by a general
de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iance of all Men.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, not to let a universal
discontent be established, which would
make you be abandoned of all the World,
it will be proper to appear disinteressed
sometimes through a secret design of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage;
it will be good to give to the
Publick certain Actions of a seeming free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
but indeed contrived, and to force
your Nature to do a favour as Nobly, as i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
it came from a true Inclination.</p>
            <p>By this you will make the past displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
forgotten, and leave nothing in view,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:44396:109"/>
but what's agreeable for the future.</p>
            <p>But in these rare occasions the secret is,
to chuse a Merit well known, or one of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hose pleasing subjects, which affect the
Inclinations of Men: By this universal
Esteem, or Friendship, every one foolishly
thinks him obliged for a favour, which is
received but by one single person.</p>
            <p>After the noise of so fine an Action, let
the World rest in the Opinion of your Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerosity,
and take pleasure some time in
laughing at the Courting of Parasites, and
the approbation of Ill Judges.</p>
            <p>As you have excited thereby desires, and
permitted hopes to be conceived, all those
that think themselves deserving, will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to shew themselves in your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.</p>
            <p>Your Enemies will search secret ways to
reconcile themselves, that they may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>not
be excluded from your favours. Your
Friends, encouraged by a new Zeal, will
do their utmost to deserve them; and those
persons, that are particularly intimate
with you, will redouble their cares and
their diligence in the performance of their
Charges.</p>
            <p>Then seeing the whole World well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united
upon your commendations, you
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:44396:110"/>
will insensibly take again your usual me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods.</p>
            <p>Your Acquaintance will become more
difficult, to have a sight of you will be no
small favour, to converse with you will be
a greater, your frowns will repulse the
troublesome, and your smiles will satisfie
the Ignorant; your familiarity, as severe
as it is, shall be managed as a precious
favour; and to conclude this discourse in

of tasting the most real good.</p>
            <p>A Man, raised to Grandeurs, that makes
others find their Fortune in his, joins a
great Merit to a great Happiness, he is not
the more happy by the Wealth, which he
enjoys, than by that which he knows how
to give: But he that, like you, seeks his
Interest with all the World, and cannot
suffer the company of any one, makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
unworthy of common Society, and
deserves to be excluded from the conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all Men.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, for all the ill opinion I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
of you, it seems to me that there is a
vanity in the confession of your Vices.</p>
            <p>Nature has not left in your power the
being as wicked, as you would appear to
be.</p>
            <p>One is not absolutely ungrateful with
impunity; one doth not betray without
remorse; one is not so greedy after the
Wealth of another, and so covetous of his
own without some shame. And when you
shall be composed within your self, free
from internal Combats and secret Agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
you are still to account with the

troublesome Accusations you must be

            <p>As for that Genius of Interest, which
you spoke to us of, 'tis that which renders
you contemptible: For there are Illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Debauchees, but there never was an
Illustrious Miser.</p>
            <p>The Grandeur of the Soul cannot consist
with the filthiness of Avarice. Besides,
what is more unjust, than to procure all
that makes up the Commerce and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage

            <p>'Tis justifying the Crime, and robbing

            <p>Those, that take away with violence,
to disperse with profusion, are much more

            <p>Their expence is, as it were, a sort of

without pretending to subject any

when I cannot enjoy the Conversation of

of things, that I have but cursorily stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died,

            <p>Divinity seems to me very considerable,
as a Science which regards Salvation:
But in my judgment, it is become too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;
and it is ridiculous that even Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
dare dispute on questions, which
should be handled with a great deal of My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery

for us to be tractable and submissive. Let

our Doctors are the first to ruin this defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,

since <hi>Bacon,</hi> could not suffer that <hi>Aristotle</hi>

            <p>It is perhaps by these sorts of Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
that the Divines are not sometimes
the most tractable; from whence comes

with more moderation, and that

would have less Curiosity.</p>
            <p>As Philosophy gives more liberty to the
Mind, I have improved that a little more.
In this time, where the Understanding
gives way to Knowledge, I had a curious
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>esire <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o comprehend the Nature of things,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:44396:114"/>
and Presumption presently perswaded me,
that I was acquainted therewith: the least
Proof seemed to me a Certainty, and a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
was to me a Truth; and I cannot
express to you with what Contempt I
look'd upon those, that I imagined Ignorant
in what I thought my self instructed. At
length, when Age and Experience, which
unhappily come together, had caused me
to make serious Reflections, I began to lay
aside a Science always Contested, and upon
which the greatest Men have had different
Sentiments. I knew by the Universal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of Nations, that <hi>Plato, Aristotle, Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi>
and <hi>Epicurus,</hi> had been the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous
of their Age; yet there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
so contrary as their Opinions. Three
Thousand Years after, I found them equally
disputed, Partisans of all sides, nothing of
Certainty and Assurance. In the midst of
these Meditations, which insensibly disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused
me, I had the curiosity to see <hi>Gassen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi>
the most enlightned of Philosophers,
and the least presumptuous. After some
long Entertainments, where he made me
see all that Reason could inspite, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained,
that Nature had given so much
Extent to Curiosity, and such narrow
bounds to our Knowledge; that he did not
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:44396:115"/>
say it to mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ifie the Presumption of others,
or by a false Humility of him, which sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
altogether of Hypocrisie; that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
he was not ignorant of what might be
thought upon many things; but to know
well, the most Inconsiderable, he durst not
assure to himself. Then a Science, which
was already suspected to me, appeared too
vain to enslave my self to it any longer; I
broke all Commerce with it, and began to
admire how it was possible for a wise Man
to pass his Life in unprofitable Enquiries.</p>
            <p>The Mathematicks have, indeed, much
more of Certainty; but when I consider
the profound Meditations they require, as
they draw you from Action and Pleasures,
to employ you entirely, its Demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
seem to me very dear, and one must be
very amorous of a Truth, to search after
it at that Price. You will tell me, that we
have but few Conveniencies in Life, few
Ornaments, but we are obliged to them
for: I will ingeniously acknowledge it;
there are no Commendations which I will

               </gap>t afford the great Mathematicians, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
that I am not one of them. I admire
their Inventions, and the Works which
they produce: but I am of Opinion, that

<pb n="213" facs="tcp:44396:115"/>
to apply them well; for to speak wisely, we
have more Interest to enjoy the World,
than to know it.</p>
            <p>I find no Sciences that particularly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to Gentlemen, but Morality, Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
and the knowledge of good Literature.</p>
            <p>The first regards Reason, the second So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
the third Conversation.</p>
            <p>The one teaches us to rule our Passions,
by the other you are instructed in Affairs
of State, and how to direct your self in the
Fortune of your Life. The last polisheth
the Mind, inspires Delicacy, and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
The Persons of Quality amongst
the Ancients, had a particular Care to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
themselves in all things; every one
knows that <hi>Greece</hi> has given to the World,
the greatest Philosophers, and the greatest
Legislators: And one cannot deny, but that
other Nations have taken from thence all
the Politeness they have had.</p>
            <p>The beginnings of <hi>Rome</hi> were Ignorant
and Savage, and that wild Vertue which
did not pardon their own Children, was
advantagious to the Common-wealth; as
they began to be more reasonable, they
found a way for the Motions of Nature to
consist with the Love of their Countrey;
at length they joyned Graces and Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:44396:116"/>
to Justice and Reason. It has been
seen then in the latter times, that there was
no body of any Consideration, but what
was tied to some Sect of Philosophy, not
with a design to comprehend the Principles
and Nature of things, but to fortifie their
Minds by the study of Wisdom.</p>
            <p>As for Politicks, it is incredible how the
<hi>Romans</hi> instructed themselves early in all the
Interests of their State; how they applied
themselves in the Knowledge of their Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and Laws, as far as to render them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selve<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
capable of the Affairs of Peace and
War, even without Experience. The least
Curious know after what manner they
were affe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ted with Learning, and it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that one saw but few great Men at
<hi>Rome,</hi> who did not entertain some ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Greeks, to talk of things that were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable.</p>
            <p>Amongst a hundred Examples, that I
could alledge, I will content my self with
that of <hi>Caesar,</hi> and it will suffice for my
own Opinion to rely upon his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>Of all the Sects that were then in Repute,
he chose that of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> as the most plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant,
and most conformable to his Nature,
and his Pleasures; for there were two sorts
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:44396:116"/>
of <hi>Epicureans,</hi> the one teaching Philosophy
in Retirements, according to Precept; the
other, who could not approve of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity
of too rigid Philosophers, gave way
only to more natural Opinions. Of these
last have been the greatest part of the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
Men of that time, who knew how
to distinguish the person from the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
and apply their Cares to the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
in such a manner, that there was left
enough, both for their Friends, and for
themselves. It would be unprofitable to
explain to you the Knowledge that <hi>Caesar</hi>
had of the Affairs of State, as well as the
politeness and beauty of his Genius: I
will only say, that he could dispute for the
Mastery of Eloquence with <hi>Cicero;</hi> and if
he did not affect the Reputation of it, no
person can deny that he both writ, and
spoke much better, as a person of Quality,
than <hi>Cicero.</hi>

the old Age of <hi>Corneille</hi> much less a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larms

to see the writing of Tragedies end with
him. But I wish, that, before his Death,
he would adopt the Author of this Piece,
to form with the tenderness of a Father his

               </gap>rue Successor. I wish, that he would af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
him the good tast of Antiquity, which
he enjoys so much to his Advantage; that
he would make him enter into the Genius
of those dead Nations, and know judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
the Character of Heroes, which
are no more. It is, in my Opinion, the
only thing which is wanting to so fine a
Wit. He has Thoughts strong, and bold;
Expressions, which equal the force of his
Thoughts: But then you will permit me to
tell you, That he was not acquainted with
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:44396:117"/>
               <hi>Alexander,</hi> or <hi>Porus.</hi> It appears, that he
had a mind to give a greater Idea of <hi>Porus,</hi>
than of <hi>Alexander,</hi> wherein it was not
possible for him to succeed; for the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of <hi>Alexander,</hi> as true as it is, has much
of the Air of a <hi>Romance;</hi> and to make a
greater Heroe, is to make him pass for <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous,</hi>
to take from his Work, not only
the credit of Truth, but the agreeableness
of Probability. Let us not imagine any
thing greater than this Master of the
World, when our Imaginations shall be
too vast, and elevated: If we would give
other Heroes an advantage over him, let us
take from them the Vices which he had,
and give them the Vertues which he had
not: don't let us make <hi>Scipio</hi> greater, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
there never was amongst the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
a Soul so aspiring as his; he should
be made more Just, more disposed to do
Good, more Moderate, more Temperate,
and more Vertuous.</p>
            <p>Let the greatest Admirers of <hi>Caesar</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Alexander,</hi> alledge in his Favour,
neither the Passion of Glory, the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur
of the Soul, nor the Firmness of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.
These Qualities are so compleat in
the <hi>Graecian,</hi> that to have been more, would
have have been too much; but let them
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:44396:118"/>
make the <hi>Roman</hi> more wise in his Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises,
more dexterous in his Affairs, to
have understood his Interests better,
and more Master of himself in his Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>
            <p>One who was a very curious Judge of the
desert of Men, is contented to liken to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander,</hi>
him, to whom he would give the
highest Character: He durst not attribute
to him greater Qualities, but took away
from him the Bad. <hi>Magno illi Alexandro

            </p>
            <p>Perhaps our Author is entred into these
Considerations in some measure; perhaps,
to make <hi>Porus</hi> the greater, without Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancing,
he took the party to lessen his
<hi>Alexander.</hi> If that was his design, he could
not succeed better therein, for he has made
of him so moderate a Prince, that a hundred
others might be preferred before, like him,

he has not the force to sustain it, unless
through Modesty he had a mind to appear

A maker of Romances may frame his He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes

importance also to give a true Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
of an obscure Prince, whose reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is not arrived to us: But these great
Persons of Antiquity, so famous in their
Age, and more known amongst us, than
the Living; the <hi>Alexander's,</hi> the <hi>Scipio's,</hi>
the <hi>Caesars,</hi> ought never to lose their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
in our hands. For the least curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Spectator perceives, that he is inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
when they give to them Faults, which
they had not, or when they take from
them Vertues, which had made upon his
mind an agreeable impression. Vertues
once established amongst us, interess our
proper love, as our true Master, and one
cannot bring the least alteration, withou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <pb n="226" facs="tcp:44396:122"/>
making us discern this change with Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.
Upon the whole, one ought not
to disfigure them in War, to render them
more illustrious in their Amours; we
may give them Mistresses of our own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
we may mix Passion with their
Glory; but let us take care of making an
<hi>Anthony</hi> of an <hi>Alexander,</hi> and not ruine
Heroes confirmed by so many Ages, in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of a Lover, whom we form to our
single Fancy.</p>
            <p>To reject the love of our Tragedies as
unworthy of Heroes, is to take away that
which makes us hold to them by a secret
relation, and I know not what cohaerence,
which still remains between their Souls
and others: But to bring them to us by
this common Sentiment, don't let us make
them descend beneath themselves, nor
destroy what they possess above Men.
With this moderation, I will affirm that
there are no Subjects, where a general
Passion, which Nature hath dispersed
throughout, can't enter without trouble
and violence. Moreover, as Women are
as necessary for the representation, as Men,
it is convenient to make them speak, as
much as one can, of that which is most
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:44396:122"/>
agreeable to their nature, and of which
they speak much better than of other
things. If you take away from some the
expression of Amorous Thoughts, and
from others a converse in Secret, into
which, a confidence which they have of
each other, makes them enter, you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
them for the most part to very te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
Conversations. As if all their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as their Discourses, ought to be
the effects of their Passion; their Joy,
their Sorrow, their Fears, their Desires,
ought to relish of a little love, to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</p>
            <p>If you introduce a Mother who rejoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
for the Happiness of her Beloved
Son, or afflicts her self for the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
of her poor Daughter, her Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
or her Loss will make but little
impression upon the Souls of the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.
To be affected with the Tears and
Complaints of this Sex, let us see a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress
that bewails the Death of a Lover,
and not a Wife, that laments for the loss
of a Husband.</p>
            <p>The Grief of Mistresses, which is ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
has much more influence upon us,
than the affliction of an invegling, self-interessed
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:44396:123"/>
Widow, and as sincere as she
happens to be sometimes, always affords
us a Melancholy Idea of Funerals, and
their dismal Ceremonies. Of all the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,
that ever appeared upon the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre,
I love to see none but <hi>Cornelia,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
instead of making me think of
Children without a Father, and a Wife
without a Spouse, her Affections all over
<hi>Roman,</hi> recall into my mind the Idea of
ancient <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Great <hi>Pompey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Behold all that may reasonably be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to Love upon our Theatres, but
let them be contented with this, and so
far even their Rules will allow of it, and
let not its greatest favourers believe that
the chief design of Tragedy, is to excite
a sort of tenderness in our hearts. In
subjects truly Heroick, the Greatness of
the Soul ought to be kept up before all
things. That which would be pleasing
and tender in the Mistress of an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Man, is often weak and disgraceful in
the Mistress of a Heroe. She may enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
her self, when alone, with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Combats, which she is sensible of
in her self, she may Sigh in Secret for
her misery, trust to a beloved and severe
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:44396:123"/>
Confident, her Fears and her Griefs: But
sustained by her Glory, and fortified by
her reason, she ought always to remain
Mistress of her Passions, and animate
her Lover to great things by her Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
instead of disheartening him by her
weakness.</p>
            <p>Indeed, 'tis an unworthy Spectacle to
see the Courage of a Heroe softned by
Tears and Sighs; and if so be he fiercely
contemns the Griefs of a Beautiful per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that loves him, he discovers the firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his heart, less than the hardness
of his Soul.</p>
            <p>To avoid this inconvenience, <hi>Corneille</hi>
has no less regard to the Character of Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious
Women, than to that of his He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes.
<hi>Aemilia</hi> encourages <hi>Cinna</hi> to the

               <hi>Cleopatra</hi> hath a Passion for <hi>Caesar,</hi> and
leaves nothing undone to preserve <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey:</hi>
she would be unworthy of <hi>Caesar,</hi> if
she did not oppose the baseness of her

upon her self the fatal explication of the

for the love of her.</p>
            <p>But one should consider <hi>Sophonisba,</hi>
whose Character might be envied by the

Sacrifice the young <hi>Massinissa</hi> to Old <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phax</hi>
for the good of her Countrey; one
should see her hearken as little to the
Scruples of Duty in quitting <hi>Siphax,</hi> as
she had done the Sentiments of her love,
in losing <hi>Massinissa:</hi> One should see her,
who subjects all sorts of Obligations,
what binds us, what unites us, the
strongest Chains, the most tender Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to her Love for <hi>Carthage,</hi> and her
Hatred for <hi>Rome.</hi> In a word, one should
see her, when<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> she's utterly abandoned,
not wanting to her self, and when those
hearts, which she had gained to save her
Countrey signified nothing, to owe to
her self the last support to pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Glory and her Liberty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Corneille</hi> makes his Heroes speak with so
much decency, that he had never given us
the Conversation of <hi>Caesar</hi> with <hi>Cleopatra,</hi>
if so be <hi>Caesar</hi> could have been believed to
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:44396:124"/>
have had the Business, which he had at
<hi>Alexandria,</hi> as Beautiful as she was, as far
as to have rendred the Converse of a Lover
to indifferent Persons, that should hear it.
He had certainly let that alone, but that
the Battel of <hi>Pharsalia</hi> was fully won,
<hi>Pompey</hi> dead, and all that took part with
him in flight. As <hi>Caesar</hi> then believed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to be the Master of all, they might
offer him an acquired Glory, and a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in all appearance assured: But when
he discovered the Conspiracy of <hi>Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi>
when he beholds his affairs in an ill
Condition, and his own Life in Danger,
it is no more a Lover, that entertains
his Mistress with his Passion, but the
<hi>Roman</hi> General, that speaks to the Queen
of the Danger which relates to them,
and leaves her with hast to provide for
their common Security.</p>
            <p>It is ridiculous then to take <hi>Porus</hi> up
with his single Love upon the point of a
great Battel, which was to make a decisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all things for him; it is no less to
make <hi>Alexander</hi> depart, when the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
began to rally. One might have made
him enter with impatience to seek <hi>Porus,</hi>
not to draw him from thence with precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:44396:125"/>
to go and revisit <hi>Cleophile,</hi> he, that
never had those Amorous Impatiences, and
who never thought a Victory to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat,
till he had either destroyed, or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned.
That which I find more miserable
on his account, is that he is made to lose
much of one side, without gaining any
thing on t'other. He is as little a Heroe
of Love, as of War, and the History is
disfigured, without any Ornament to the
Romance: A Warriour, whose Glory can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
inflame us: A Lover, whose Passion
cannot affect us.</p>
            <p>Behold what I had to say of <hi>Alexander</hi>
and <hi>Porus.</hi> If so be I am not regularly ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

less mind to examine the piece in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
than to enlarge my self upon the deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
one ought to observe in the Discourses
of Heroes, upon the Judgment one should

            <head>A IVDGMENT
UPON
Seneca, Plutarch and Petronius.</head>
            <p>I Will begin with <hi>Seneca,</hi> and will tell
you with the utmost impudence that I
esteem much more his Person, than his
Works. I esteem the Tutor of <hi>Nero,</hi> the
Gallant of <hi>Agrippina,</hi> an Ambitious Man
that pretended to the Empire: Of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher,
and Writer, I make but little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
and am affected neither with his
Stile, nor his Thoughts. His Latin has
nothing of resemblance to that of <hi>Augustus</hi>'s
time, nothing of easie, nothing of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral;
all made up of points, all fanciful;
more of the heat of <hi>Affrick,</hi> or <hi>Spain</hi> in
them, than the Light of <hi>Greece,</hi> or <hi>Italy.</hi>
You see there abrupt things, that have the
Air and Shape of Sentences; but which
have neither their Solidity, nor their
good Sence: Which wet and spur on the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:44396:126"/>
Spirit, without winning the Judgment.</p>
            <p>His forced Discourse communicates to
me a sort of constraint; and the Soul, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of finding there its Satisfaction and
Repose, meets with Trouble and Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nero,</hi> although one of the most wicked
Princes of the World, was notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very Ingenious, and had near him a
sort of under Masters extreamly Curious,
who used <hi>Seneca</hi> as a Pedant, and turned
him into ridicule. I am not of the Opinion
of <hi>Berville,</hi> who imagined that the false
<hi>Eumolpus</hi> of <hi>Petronius</hi> was the true <hi>Seneca.</hi>
If so be <hi>Petronius</hi> would have given him an
injurious Character, it had been under the
Person of a Pedantick Philosopher, rather
than an impertinent Poet. Besides, 'tis as
it were impossible to find any agreement
therein. <hi>Seneca</hi> was the Richest Man of
the Empire, and always commended Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty.
<hi>Eumolpus,</hi> a Poet very low in the
World, and in the despair of his Fortune,
he complained of the Ingratitude of the
Age, and found no other comfort than that
<hi>bonae mentis soror est paupertas.</hi> If <hi>Seneca</hi>
had Vices, he conceal'd them with care un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the appearance of Wisdom: <hi>Eumolpus</hi>
               <pb n="235" facs="tcp:44396:126"/>
made a Vanity of his, and used his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
with much Liberty.</p>
            <p>I don't app<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ehend then upon what <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi>
could ground his Conjecture. But I
am deceived if all that <hi>Petronius</hi> says of the
Stile of his time, of the Corruption of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
and Poetry, if the <hi>controversiae sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiis
vibrantibus pictae,</hi> which offended
him so much, if the <hi>vanus sententiarum
strepitus,</hi> wherewith he was astonished,
doth not belong to <hi>Seneca,</hi> if the <hi>perambages
&amp; Deorum Ministeria, &amp;c.</hi> did not relate
to the <hi>Pharsalia</hi> of <hi>Lucan:</hi> if the Encomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums,
which he gives to <hi>Cicero, Virgil</hi> and
Horace, were not designed in contempt of
the Uncle, and Nephew. Be it as it will,
to return to what appers to me concerning
this Philosopher, I never read his Writings,
without removing my self from the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which he would inspire his Readers
with. If he attempts to perswade Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
I long for his Riches; his Vertue
frightens me, and the lest despos'd to Vice
would abandon himself to pleasures by the
description, which he gives of them. In a
word, he speaks so much of Death, and
leaves me such Melancholy Ideas, that I
do my utmost endeavours not to improve
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:44396:127"/>
by his Lecture. The finest things that I
find in his Works, are the Examples and
Citations he mingles therein. As he lived
in a curious Court, and knew a thousand
fine things of all Times, he alledges some
that are very agreeable, sometimes of the
Greeks, sometimes of <hi>Caesar, Augustus</hi> and
<hi>Mecaenas,</hi> for after all his Parts, and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
were infinite: But his Stile has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that affects me, his Opinions are too
severe, and 'tis ridiculous that one who
lived in abundance, and was so careful of
himself, should encourage nothing but Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
and Death.</p>

PLUTARCH.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>MOntagne</hi> has found much resemblance
between <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Sen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

great Philosophers, great Encouragers of
Wisdom and Vertue, both Tutors of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Emperors: The one more Rich and
Elevated; the other more Happy in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:44396:127"/>
of his Pupil. The Opinions of
<hi>Plutarch</hi> (as the same <hi>Montagne</hi> affirms)
are more sweet and more agreeable to So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety:
He thinks those of <hi>Seneca</hi> more so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid,
but I, more rough, more severe. <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi>
sweetly insinuates Wisdom, and
would render Vertue familiar even in Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.
<hi>Seneca</hi> brings back all Pleasures to
Wisdom, and esteems the Philosopher on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Happy. <hi>Plutarch,</hi> natural, and first
perswaded, easily perswades others: The
Spirit of <hi>Seneca</hi> opposes it self, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages
it self to Vertue, and as if it were to
him a strange thing, he takes pains to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
himself. As for the Stile of <hi>Plutarch,</hi>
having no Experience in Greek, I cannot
make a certain Judgment: But I will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
to you, that amongst the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises
of his Morals, there's a great deal
which I cannot comprehend, whether it
be through the great difference of things
and manners of his time, from those of
ours, or that they are really above my lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
understanding. The familiar Spirit of
<hi>Socrates,</hi> the Creation of the Soul, the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of the Moon, may be admirable to those
that understand them. I will confess to
you Ingeniously, that I don't apprehend the
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:44396:128"/>
Beauty of them; and if they are wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
'tis a wonder that's beyond my Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.
One may judge by the good Words
of the Ancients, which he hath left us, by
his Sayings which he hath Collected with
so much Care, by his long Table Discourses,
how much he was taken with Converse.
In the mean time, whether it were that
there was but little of delicacy at those
Times, or else that his Palate was not very
exquisite: He supports grave and serious
things with a great deal of good Sense and
Reason; in things that depend purely upon
Wit, he has nothing of ingenious, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate.</p>
               <p>To speak the truth, the Lives of Illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Men is the Master-piece of <hi>Plutarch,</hi>
and in my Opinion one of the Noblest
Works in the World. You see there those
great Men set in publick view, and in their
retirements at home, you see them in the
purity of their Nature, and in the whole
extent of action. One sees therein the
Resolution of <hi>Brutus,</hi> and that fierce an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to the evil Genius that spoke to him:
One sees that there remained with him
in spite of himself some Impression of this
Ghost, which the reasoning of <hi>Cassius</hi> had
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:44396:128"/>
much ado to efface. A few days after,
one sees him put his Troops in order, and
give Battel so successfully on his side, and
so fatally by the Error of <hi>Cassius.</hi> One <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ees
him try his Fortune again, lose the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,
reproach Vertue; and find more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
in despair, than with an ungrateful
Mistress whom he had so well served.</p>
               <p>There is a natural force in the Discourse
of <hi>Plutarch,</hi> which equals the greatest
actions; and 'tis of him that one may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
say, <hi>facta dictis exaequata sunt:</hi> But
he forgets neither the moderate, nor the
common ones, and examines with Care
the ordinary course of Life. As for his
Comparisons, which <hi>Montagne</hi> has found
so admirable, they appear to me indeed ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
fine: But I'm of Opinion that he might
haye gone further, and pierced more into
the bottom of their Tempers.</p>
               <p>There are folds and turnings in our Souls,
which he has avoided. He has judg'd of
Man too much in general, and has not
thought him so diff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

JUDGMENT
UPON
PETRONIUS.</head>
               <p>TO judge of the Merit of <hi>Petronius,</hi>
I will only see what <hi>Tacitus</hi> says
of him; and, without Flattery, he must
have been one of the most Gentleman-like
of the World, since he has obliged
so severe a Historian, to renounce his own
Nature, and to enlarge himself with Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
upon the Commendations of a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous
Person. Not but that a Luxury
so exquisite tended as much to the Delicacy
of Genius, as to that of the Relish. That
<hi>erudito luxu,</hi> that <hi>arbiter elegantiarum,</hi> is
the Character of an Ingenious Politeness,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ar remote from the gross thoughts of a
Vicious Man: He was not so possessed of
his Pleasures, as to become uncapable of
Business; and the sweetness of his Life did
not render him an Enemy to Employment.
He had the Merit of a Governour in his
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:44396:130"/>
Government of <hi>Bithynia,</hi> the Vertue of a
Consul in his Consulship. But instead of
subjecting his Life to his Dignity, as do
the greatest part of Men, and to bring
there all his Troubles and all his Joys, <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronius</hi>
of a Spirit superiour to his Charges,
centred them to himself; and to explain
my self after the manner of <hi>Montagne,</hi> He
did not renounce the Man, for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate.
As for his Death, after having
examined it well, either I am deceived,
or it is the finest of Antiquity. In that of
<hi>Cato,</hi> I find Trouble and even Anger.
The despair of the Affairs of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
the loss of Liberty, his Hatred to
<hi>Caesar,</hi> much assisted his Resolution, and
I know not if his rough Nature did not
extend to Fury, when he tore out his own
Bowels.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Socrates</hi> died truely as a wise Man, and
with indifference enough: Yet he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to assure himself of his Condition
in another Life, and did not: He reason'd
thereof with his Friends in the Prison
without ceasing, weakly enough; and to
say all, Death was a considerable Object to
him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Petronius</hi> alone hath shewed softness and
indifference in his. <hi>Audi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

nihil de immortalitate animae, &amp; Philosopho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum

versus.</hi> He did not only go on in his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
course, in giving Liberty to Slaves,
in chastising others, he followed those
things that pleased him; and his Soul at
the point of so doleful a Separation, was
more touched with the sweetness and easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Verse, than all the Sentiments of
Philosophers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Petronius,</hi> at his Death, leaves us nothing
but an Image of Life, no Action, no
Word, no Circumstance, Marks the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity
of a dying Person. 'Tis for him
properly, that to die is to cease to live, and
the <hi>vixit</hi> of the <hi>Romans</hi> justly appertains
to him.</p>

               <head>UPON
PETRONIUS.</head>
               <p>I AM not of the Opinion of those who
believe that <hi>Petronius</hi> had a Mind to
reprehend the Vices of his Time, and that
he composed a Satyr with the same Spirit,
that <hi>Horace</hi> writ his. I am deceived, or
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:44396:131"/>
good Manners have not so great an Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to him; He is rather a nice Courtier
that finds the Ridicule, than a publick
Censurer that ties himself to blame Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.
And to speak truth, if so be <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronius</hi>
had a mind to leave us an Ingenious
Moral in the Description of Pleasures, he
had endeavoured to give us some distast
thereof: but 'tis there that Vice appears
with all the Graces of the Author; 'tis
there he shews with the greatest Care the
agreement and Politeness of his Wit.</p>
               <p>Further, if he had had a design to instruct
us by a way more fine and conceal'd than
that of Precepts, we should at least see some
Example of Divine or Humane Justice upon
those Debauchees. So far is he from that, that
the only honest Man that he introduceth,
the Poor <hi>Licas,</hi> a Merchant of good Credit,
fearing the Gods much, miserably pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth
in a Tempest in the midst of those
depraved Persons, that are preserved. <hi>Eucol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius</hi>
and <hi>Giton</hi> embrace one another, to die
more closely united together; and Death
durst not interrupt their Pleasures. The Lust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<hi>Triphena</hi> saved her self in a Skiff, with
all that belonged to her. <hi>Eumolpus</hi> was so
little concerned at the danger, that he had
leisure enough to make an Epigram:
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:44396:131"/>
                  <hi>Licas,</hi> the Pious <hi>Licas</hi> calls to his Gods in
vain for Relief; and to the disgrace of
their Providence, the only Innocent pays
here for all the Culpable. If so be one
sees <hi>Eucolpius</hi> sometimes in his Afflictions,
they don't proceed from his Repentance.
He kill'd his Host, is a Fugitive, there's no
sort of Crime, which he has not commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
thanks to the Goodness of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
he lives without Remorse: His
Tears, his Lamentations have a very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
cause; he complains of the Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of <hi>Giton</hi> that abandons him, and his
Despair is to imagine himself in the Arms
of another, that derides the Solitude he's
reduced to.</p>
               <p>Iacent nunc amatores obligati noctibus totis,
&amp; forsitan mutuis libidinibus attriti derident
solitudinem meam.</p>
               <p>All Crimes have happily succeeded to
him, except one alone, which indeed oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion'd
him a rigorous Punishment: but
'tis an offence, for which the Divine and
Humane Laws have not ordained a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisement.
He had not answered well the
Caresses of <hi>Circe;</hi> and in truth his Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
is the only Fault, which hath trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
him. He confesses that he has failed
several times, but that he never deserved
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:44396:132"/>
Death, except on this Occasion. In a
word, without tying my self to the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
of the whole Story, he falls again
into the same Crime, and receives the
deserved Punishment with a perfect
Resignation: then he comes to himself,
and acknowledges the anger of the
Gods.</p>

to recover his Vigour, he puts himself in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Hands of a Priestess of this God
with very good Sentiments of Religion:
but indeed, the only ones he appears to
have in all his adventures. I might say
too, That the good <hi>Eumolpus</hi> is followed
by little Children, when he recites his
Verses: but when he corrupts his Scholar,
the Mother regards him as a Philosopher;
and lying in the same Chamber, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
awakes not: So severely is Ridicule
punished by <hi>Petronius,</hi> and Vice happily
protected. Judge by this, if Vertue has

                  <p>ONE cannot doubt, but that <hi>Petro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
had a Mind to shew the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucheries
of <hi>Nero,</hi> and that this Prince
was the chief Object of his Deri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ion: but
to know whether the Persons he intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
be true, or fictitious; whether he
gives us Characters according to his fancy,
of the proper Temper of certain Persons,
the thing is very difficult, and one cannot
reasonably be assured of it. As for me,
I'm of Opinion, That there is no Person
in <hi>Petronius,</hi> who may not in general a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
with <hi>Nero.</hi> Under <hi>Trimaltion</hi> in all
probability he derides his ridiculous Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence,
and the extravagance of his
Pleasures: <hi>Eumolpus</hi> represents to us the
foolish Passion, which he had for the
Theatre: <hi>Sub nominibus exoletorum, foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minarumque,
&amp; novitate cujusque stupri,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:44396:133"/>
flagitia Principis praescripsit;</hi> and by an
agreeable Disposition of different Persons
but imagined, he touches several Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinences
of the Emperour, and the usual
disorder of his Life.</p>
                  <p>One might say, That <hi>Petronius</hi> is very
contrary to himself, to blame the Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence
of Banquets, and the softness of
some other Pleasures; he that was so In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
in the search of them: <hi>Dum nihil
amoenum &amp; molle, affluentia putat, nisi quod
ei Petronius approbasset.</hi> For, to speak
the truth, although the Prince was of his
own Nature, corrupt enough, in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Plutarch,</hi> the Complaisance of
this Courtier contributed much to cast
him into all sort of Luxury and Profusion.
In that, as in the most part of things in
History, one should regard the difference
of times. Before <hi>Nero</hi> let himself yield
to this strange abandoning, no body
was so agreeable to him, as <hi>Petronius;</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
so far, as every thing passed for gross,
which had not his Approbation.</p>
                  <p>This Court was, as it were, a School of
meditated Pleasures, where all was sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient
to the Delicacy of so exquisite a
Palate. I am even of Opinion, That the
Politeness of our Author became pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:44396:133"/>
to the Publick, and that he was one
of the chief in Ruining some considerable
Persons, that made a particular Profession
of Wisdom and Vertue. He preached up
nothing but Liberality to an Emperour al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
Prodigal, softness to a voluptuous
Man; every thing that had the Face of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity,
had to him a ridiculous Air.
According to my Conjectures, <hi>Thraseas</hi>
had his turn, <hi>Helvidius</hi> his; and whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
had Merit without the Art of Pleasing,
was not troublesome without Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
In this manner of Life, <hi>Nero</hi>
corrupted himself more and more, and as
the Delicacy of Pleasures came to yield to
the disorder of the Debauch, he fell into
the extravagance of all Tastes. Then <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gellinus,</hi>
one that was jealous of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greements
of <hi>Petronius,</hi> and the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages

of Pleasures, attempted to ruine him,
<hi>quasi adversus aemulum, &amp; Scientiae volupta a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum

for him to do; for the Emperour, aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
as he was, could no longer suffer
so curious a Witness of his Infamies: He
was less troubled through the Remorse of
his Crimes, than through a secret Shame
which he felt, of his gross Pleasures, when
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:44396:134"/>
he remembred the Delicacy of things past.
<hi>Petronius</hi> on his side had no less distastes;
and I believe, that in the time of his
private Discontents, he composed that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
Satyr, which we have but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily
misrepresented.</p>
                  <p>We see in <hi>Tacitus</hi> the noise of his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace,

In the mean time as <hi>Eucolpion,</hi> to represent

something of greatness, he judiciously takes
care not to ruine the Idea's which he gives

in making Verses out of Season, even in

to continue this fine Art by the means of

her Children, whom she introduced with

that had it not. In a word, there is no Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

                  <p>Although the Style of the Declamer
seems ridiculous to <hi>Petronius,</hi> yet for all
that he shews much Eloquence in his Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations;
and to demonstrate that the
most Debauched are not incapable of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation,
Morality has nothing more seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
or better handled than the Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of <hi>Eucolpion</hi> upon the Inconstancy of
Humane Affairs, and the Uncertainty of
Death.</p>
                  <p>In every Subject that's offered, one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
think more nicely, nor speak with
more purity. Oftentimes in his Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
he lets himself go to the Simple Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and contents himself with the
Graces of Plainness: sometimes his
work is a finished piece, and then there's
nothing so exact. <hi>Catullus</hi> and <hi>Martial</hi>
                     <pb n="256" facs="tcp:44396:137"/>
treat of the same things in a gross man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
and if so be any one could find the
secret of covering what's obscene in a
Language like his, I'll answer for the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
that they would praise him for his
Discretion.</p>
                  <p>But that which <hi>Petronius</hi> hath more
particular, is, That excepting <hi>Horace</hi> in
some Odes, he is perhaps the only Person
of Antiquity, that knew how to speak of
Gallantry. <hi>Virgil</hi> is affecting in Passions;
the Amours of <hi>Dido,</hi> the Amours of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheus</hi>
and <hi>Euridice</hi> have Charms and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness:
Yet there is nothing of Gallant,
and the Poor <hi>Dido,</hi> so Compassionate was
her Soul, became Amorous of the Pious
<hi>Aeneas</hi> at the recital of his Misfortunes.
<hi>Ovid</hi> is ingenious and easie: <hi>Tibullus</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate.
In the mean time, their Mistresses
ought to be Learned.</p>
                  <p>As they alledge Gods, Fables and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
drawn from the most remote An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,
they always promise Sacrifices;
and I fancy that Monsieur ... learnt
of them the Method of burning Hearts
in Offerings. <hi>Lucian,</hi> as ingenious as he
is, becomes gross so soon as he speaks of
Love, and his Courtezans have rather the
Language of the Stews, than the Discourse
of the Bed-Chamber.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="257" facs="tcp:44396:137"/>As for me, who am a great admirer of
the Ancients, I can't but render Justice
to our Nation, and believe for certain,
that we have over them in this point a
great advantage. And, without ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancing,
after having examined this
matter, I do not know one of these great
Genius's, that could have made <hi>Massi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nissa</hi>

speak so gallantly of Love, as we have
heard them in our Language. As much
as others come below us therein, so much
doth <hi>Petronius</hi> exceed us. We have no
Romance that affords us a History so
agreeable as the <hi>Ephesian</hi> Matron. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
has so much of Gallantry as the
Love-Letters of <hi>Circe</hi> and <hi>Polienos;</hi> and
all their adventure, whether in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement,
or in the Descriptions, hath
a Character very much above the Polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of our Age. You may judge, in the

Yet there are but few People, that

about the acknowledgment of a good turn,
a thousand Men re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ine upon the Discourses
of <hi>Seneca?</hi> Is there a Question about ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitting
himself towards a Benefactor, no
body frankly confesses the debt, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
on the value of the Service? He
that hath given, magnifies Objects; he
that hath received, lessens them. The
World is full of Braggadocio's and Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites
in Friendship. Nevertheless, it
is certain that Friendship is a commerce;
the traffick thereof ought to be honest, but
'tis still a traffick. He that hath ventured
most therein, ought to reap the most. It
is not permitted to infringe it, without
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:44396:138"/>
coming to an account; but where are
those to be found, that act sincerely, and
don't put in the Balance the slightest dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure
to counter-poise the service of the
greatest weight?</p>
            <p>Every one brags of his own Heart, 'tis
a vanity <hi>Al-a-mode,</hi> you hear nothing less
repeated, and that without blushing:
then every one makes to himself a Rule
of Acknowledgment, always commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
for him, but inconvenient for his
Friends. <hi>Tacitus</hi> has told us the reason
of it; 'tis that our own acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is made use of at our own expence,
and that of others to our advantage.</p>
            <p>He that doth good, because he thinks
himself obliged to do it, doth it always
with an ill Grace: He looks upon his
Duty as a troublesome Master: He seeks
for occasions to free himself, and to shake off
a Yoke, which he bears with discontent.</p>
            <p>From whence it comes to pass, that the
Offices of these Persons have something of
a Languor in them, which takes a way all
the Blossom of the good they do us. Should
you die with shame, you must explain to
them all your Necessities; and explain
them more than once, if so be you would
have them understand you: you must
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:44396:139"/>
push them on continually by the Interest
of their own glory, and make level all their
ways. Their Hearts are always in a sort
of Lethargy. Stir them up, they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake
for a moment, and afford some token
of Life: say no more to them, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to their first State.</p>
            <p>On the other side, the Offices of true Friends
have something of liveliness, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
precedes our Wants, and even pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
our very Desires. They find every
thing easie; one is sometimes forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
them, and moderate that heat, which
carries them to goodness; 'tis of them one
may truly affirm, That they think to have
lost the day, wherein they have done no
service for those they love.</p>
            <p>But Honour, which disguiseth it self
under the name of Friendship, is nothing
but a Self-love, that serves it self in the
Person, it makes an appearance of serving.
The Friend, who acts but by this motive,
advances to do good in Proportion only to
the encrease of his Reputation. He stops
short, when his Witnesses are gone; 'tis a
false brave that turns his Eyes to see if he is
regarded; 'tis a Hypocrite, that gives Alms
with an unwilling Mind, and pays this Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to God, only to impose upon Men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="261" facs="tcp:44396:139"/>There are yet other Friends, whose only
Prospect is their own Satisfaction; this I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Law, which they lay upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
makes them faithful and generous:
but there is in all their Actions a stiff regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity,
that puzzles those whom they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige.
They do all things by weight and
measure. 'Tis a Misfortune to him that
has need of their Service, when they think
to have accomplished their Duties.</p>
            <p>Provided they have nothing to reproach
themselves with, the Misfortune of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth not affect them, on the other
side they would be concerned, that it was
ended so soon. They continue it some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
for the continuance of their own
Glory. They r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>joice, they triumph in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
for a disgrace, which gives them
an occasion of shewing themselves: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of searching the most ready means
to assist you, they search the most signal
ones to make themselves honoured: they
always make a Figure, as they go; and, in
a word, they look upon their Friends, as
Victims devoted to their Reputation.
To speak the Truth, these Persons love no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but themselves; and if they think
not to deserve reproach, one may also be of
Opinion, that they deserve no acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="262" facs="tcp:44396:140"/>You see others pass their lives in For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities,
and Complaisance; they won't
so much as pardon you a Ceremony.
These are the First Men of the World, to
comfort one upon the Death of a Father,
or to make offers of Service, after the
Sword is drawn: Is the danger pass'd,
they put themselves in Garrison with you,
and are as constant in their attendance, as
your Shadow. They are always Slaves to
Circumspection, great admirers of their
own Vertue, very importunate with those
that are indebted to them.</p>
            <p>One must acknowledge that these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straints
are extreamly troublesome to a Free
Soul. There is no good turn that is not
purchased too dear at this Price: There is
no Misfortune worse, than that of being
served after this manner; To love because
one's obliged to it, is not to love.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, if those Friendships
that are urged only by Honour or Duty,
have something of Languor or Trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>someness
in them, those that are made by
the resemblance of Humours, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
of Pleasures, are very subject
to Alteration.</p>
            <p>Since a Man is sometimes disgusted
with himself, 'tis yet more easie to be
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:44396:140"/>
disgusted with others. The end of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
depends less upon our will, than the
beginning. There is no Sympathy so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not mixed with some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety;
no agreement, that holds an
eternal Familiarity. The noblest Passions
become ridiculous in growing old. The
strongest Friendships decay with the
time; every day makes a breach there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.
One is for going immediately so
fast, that he's out of breath; in the midst
of his Journey. He wearies himself, and
wearies others.</p>
            <p>After all, says a Fickle Friend, 'tis a very
tiresome business to be always hinting to
the same Person, I love you. Nothing
comes near the Vexation, that a too sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast
Passion occasions. It is fine indeed
to endeavour to hide his distaste, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to entertain Correspondence; Letters
become insipid, Conversations languish,
the Lover tells, the Lady counts every
hour, each at length see himself reduced
to talk of the Foul or the Serene Weather.
There is not that fine Genius in Love, that
is not exhausted: there is not that Solid
Heart in Friendship, that is not repulsed.
The taste of the best things change, before
they are changed themselves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="264" facs="tcp:44396:141"/>
When the sole Interest of our Diversions
forms the Knot of Friendship, Absence,
Employments, Disorders of Life, may
easily break it, or at least untie the same.
The new Delights which are enjoyed with
new Friends, efface the remembrance of
past Contentments. The first Pleasures
of each Engagement, have something of
sharpness, that excites the desire to engage
it self more. As soon as they become
more solid, they are satiated.</p>
            <p>Wherefore there is no reason to reproach
Inconstancy, as a very great evil; it is no
move in the power of certain Persons to
love or not to love, than to be in health, or
out of order. All that one can reasonably
demand from Fickle Persons, is ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
to acknowledge their Levity, and not
to add Treason to Inconstancy.</p>
            <p>For it happens but too often, that the
best established Friendships, the most
strict Confidences, insensibly slacken. We
are to blame to exclaim against Ingratitude,
and to decry those that desert us; we are
sometimes glad, that they give us an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of change. We seek a Quarrel, we
seem to be angry, to the end of finding
some pretence to set our selves at liberty:
But supposing it were a real Anger, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:44396:141"/>
it is not their fault, it may be 'tis our
own: which of us hath a right to judge
of it? That which we call a Crime of
the Soul, is very often a defect of Nature.
God was not pleased to make us Perfect
enough to be always amiable: why should
we desire then to be always loved?</p>
            <p>Without doubt we took more care at the
beginning to conceal our Imperfections:
our Complacency held the place of the
greatest merit: we enjoyed the Graces of
Novelty; these Graces resemble a certain
Flower, which the Dew disperses upon
Fruits; there are but few Hands dextrous
enough to gather them, without spoiling
the same.</p>
            <p>One must acknowledge, then, that even
the best Men find in the strongest Unions,
Intervals of heaviness and weakness,
whereof they know not always the cause:
This weakness, when it is not supported,
passes at length to the Death of Friendship,
if so be Honour comes not to its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scue.</p>
            <p>'Tis Honour, that labours sometimes to
hide the defects of the Heart, that plays the
Person of Tenderness, that saves appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
for some time, till the Inclination
is awaked, and retakes its former vigour.
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:44396:142"/>
I don't mean that Formal and Ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Honour, that consists in nothing but
Rules and ridiculous Looks, that takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
all from the unfortunate, as far as an
opportunity to complain, and whose Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
becomes sometimes more insupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
than Infidelity it self.</p>
            <p>I speak of a true reason, that agrees with
the Imperfections of our Nature, that
helps them the best it can, that's an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to Affectation, that aims at good, for
the sake of good alone, and far remote
from all the Evasions of Self-love; that's
always ready to perform a Kindness, and
thinks never to have done enough; that
doth not applaud it self, nor seeks for the
Applause of the World.</p>
            <p>It is certain then, that these two Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
stand in need of one another, and
that if Honour without Friendship is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable,
Friendship, that is not sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by Honour, is never well as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured.</p>

            <head>OBSERVATIONS
UPON THE
MAXIM;
Which says,
One ought to despise Fortune,
and not care for the Court.</head>
            <p>IT is more difficult to perswade this
Maxim, than the rest. They that
receive Favours, even they that have but
simple Pretentions, laugh at a Notion so
contrary to theirs.</p>
            <p>I confess, that it is not easie to believe,
that Reasonable Men would make this
Opinion Universal: I fansie they had no
other design than to speak to the Unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
and to cure sick Minds of an unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
Disquiet.</p>
            <p>In this case I cannot condemn them; if
'tis permitted to call a Mistress Ungrateful
and Cruel, when a Man hath served her
without any effect; 'tis sure most reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
for those that think to have received
Outrages from Fortune, to have the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:44396:143"/>
of forsaking her, and to seek, far
from the Court, a Repose which makes
some amends to them for the advantages
which she has denyed them: what injury
is done her to return Contempt for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt?</p>
            <p>I don't find it strange then in this case,
for a Gentleman to despise the Court: but
I think it ridiculous for him to despise it,
in hopes of making himself honoured.
It is fine to act the Philosopher, but this
Philosophy is to me suspected of Vanity.
I am not the Cully of those Hypocrites at
Court, that preach to others upon retreat,
and cannot perswade themselves that 'tis
a happiness. The more they labour to
make a suitable appearance in their Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
the more earnest is their desire of
altering their State.</p>
            <p>They don't so much as attend the call
of Fortune: the least hope makes them
forget all their Oaths; they cast them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
at the Feet of that Mistress, whom
they had exclaim'd against; they become
the Slaves of those Favourites, whom
they had braved; and their false Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
has been of no other use, than to render
their change the more contemptible.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="269" facs="tcp:44396:143"/>They return to the Court, like Persons
of another World; their Habits, their
Air, their Language, are no more <hi>Al-a-mode;</hi>
they pass for Strangers in their
own Country, and for ridiculous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
amongst the young Courtiers. There
is no Patience which they don't put to
the extremity, with their Tales of Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Times, and their Stories of the Old
War. They give Lessons to all Comers,
both of Military Discipline, and fine
Gallantry. They put forth upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
cold Ralleries against Flaxen Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwigs
and wide Pantaloons. Too happy,
provided you hearken to them, and make
an appearance of giving Credit to them:
but the thanks which you receive,
are not worth the tiresomeness they give
you.</p>
            <p>There are others, that are not less dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing
to me; they are those, who
can't leave the Court, and yet are vexed
at every thing which passes there; who
interess themselves in the disgrace of the
most indifferent Persons, and who find
fault with the Preferment of their own
Friends.</p>
            <p>They look upon, as an injustice, all the
Good and Bad that's done to others; it
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:44396:144"/>
doth not suffice to merit the being Happy
to avoid their Envy: but to be Unhappy,
just suffices to attract their Pity.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, if you hearken to
these Persons, they'll talk to you of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Constancy, Generosity, and
Honour: and in every thing they say,
there's always a melancholy Air that
makes you sad, instead of affording you
some Comfort. They meet with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Pleasure in Complaints, which makes
you not to be obliged to them for their
Pity. They never find the State well
Governed, they favour no living Person,
they give Quarter only to the Dead. Their
Choler blemishes the best Things; if
through respect it spares the Prince, it
diffuseth it self bitterly amongst his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites.
In a word, they are ill Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,
ill Philosophers, and very unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Friends.</p>
            <p>They are uncapable of the Cares of
a Tumultuous Life, they can't taste the
Repose of a Retired one, their Disquiet
tosses them up and down, and raises them
to nothing: Like those that travel in a
Dream, the error of their Imagination
torments them more, than the truth it
self would do; and just as if they had
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:44396:144"/>
dreamt all their Life, they find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
as little advanced the last Day, as
they were the first.</p>
            <p>We are not in a time to storm against
the Government. He that Rules is no
less above Censorious Persons, by the
Wisdom of his Conduct, than by the
Majesty of his Rank. In truth, 'tis
a Misfortune for the Peevish Courtiers,
to have no Minister in their Prospect,
that might serve as a pretence for their
Cabals. But at last, Intrigue is no more
in fashion, the Court laughs at those
that discommend it, one gains nothing
there by acting the discontented, she is
repulsed by the importunity of those,
who can't be satisfied; she is deaf to their
Complaints, because one's aweary of
pitying those, who complain eternally.</p>
            <p>In whatsoever place you go, you ought
to depend upon finding the World com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
of two sort of Persons, the one
mind their Employments, the other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
their Pleasures.</p>
            <p>The first fly from the access of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable,
and are afraid of becoming so by
Contagion. To enter into their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,
one must hide his Infirmity, and
be serviceable to them in some things:
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:44396:145"/>
Interest alone is an infallible bait to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
their Confidence, Compassion is of
no use therein, they are hardened by a
long experience against the Miseries of
others, and have preserved nothing of
Tenderness, but for themselves.</p>
            <p>Those that give themselves up entirely
to their Diversions, have something more
of Humanity, and are more familiar.
Their Mistresses, their Confidents advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
themselvs by the follies which em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
them. Their Souls are more open,
but their Conduct more uncertain: Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
always carries them beyond Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
they look upon the Duties of
Life, as an insupportable burthen. To
live long with them, you must follow
the course of their Pleasure, confide but
little in them, and know their Minds as
much as you can.</p>
            <p>The greatest Art consists in knowing
well these two sorts of Persons. As long
as you are engaged in the World, you
must comply with its Maxims, because
there is no fancy more unprofitable, than
the Wisdom of these, who turn to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers
of the Age.</p>
            <p>'Tis a Person that one cannot long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
without offending his Friends, and
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:44396:145"/>
rendring himself ridiculous: there is no
Life chast enough to afford this privilege,
when Employments do not allow it.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the most part of
these Reformers have their Prospects,
their Interests, their Cabals: one may
well exclaim against them, all that is
asserted of them at Court and upon the
Stage, doth not move them; if they
find one Passage stopt, they re-enter at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.
<hi>Proteus</hi> had less variety of shapes,
than these Persons have of Air and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.
Hearken to their Remonstran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
you shall have them immediately
for Masters; Give no attention to them,
they become your Enemies. The most
secure way then, is to avoid their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
to have always before our
Eyes, that these Reformers have been
Men like us, and are still, for all the
Figure they make, and perhaps more
than we. As long as Fortune smiled up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, they have enjoyed her Favours:
are they fallen into any Disgrace, they
seek to raise themselves, and put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
forward by a Reputation of Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
They become Persons of Quality,
just as Wanton Girls become Wise. Old
Age too hastily advanced, brings Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:44396:146"/>
with Wrinkles; Frauds and Kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
are of no more use, Cullies are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceived,
Disgrace approaches, one is at
a loss how to behave himself. The
World is a Comedy, every Comedian
plays his part therein: but there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
so unbecoming as to shew himself
when 'tis ended, and to come and
censure those, that remain upon the
Stage.</p>
            <p>To what purpose is it, to hate in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the Fortune they seem to neglect
for themselves? if they would have it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
that they have quitted it, why do
they pretend to find fault with others for
pursuing the same?</p>
            <p>Their Aversion is tied to those, that
stand for Favours, their envy to those that
obtain them, and their Animosity to the
Persons that distribute them: And to have
their esteem, or their friendship, one must
be dead, or at least very miserable.</p>
            <p>I know that a Gentleman is always to
be pitied in Adversity, and that a Fop is
always to be despised, whatsoever Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
he is in. But to hate Favourites
through the sole hatred of Favour; to
love the miserable through the sole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of their Disgrace, is a very odd
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:44396:146"/>
sort of Conduct, incommodious to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
insupportable to others, and always
prejudicial.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding, the diversity of minds
shews all these different effects in the Life
of Courtiers.</p>
            <p>We have said, there are Persons enough
at Court, that break with their Friends
at the very moment, when some disorder
happens to them; who have neither
Friendship, nor Aversion, but what is
measured by Interest. Whosoever is not
useful to them, never wants Defects; and
he that is in a State of serving them, is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
with all Perfections.</p>
            <p>There are others, who don't content
themselves with deserting the unfortunate,
they insult over them even in the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune:
the more humility they shew in
flattering Favourites, the more fierce they
are in affronting those, that are fallen into
some Disgrace.</p>
            <p>To speak the truth, if the moroseness of
those, who storm against Fortune conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually,
is extravagant, the Prostitution of
those who Sacrifice to her even as far as
their Friends, is infamous.</p>
            <p>There is an exact Situation between
Baseness, and False Generosity; there is a
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:44396:147"/>
true Honour that Rules the Conduct of
Reasonable Persons. It is not disallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
for an honest Man to have his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
and his Interest; but he must fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
them by lawful means. He may
have Art without Subtilty, Dexterity
without Deceit, and Complaisance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Flattery. When he is a Friend of
the Favourites, he enters agreeably into
their Pleasures, and faithfully into their
Secrets: if they happen to fail, he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes
of their Misfortunes, as well as he did
of their Favours.</p>
            <p>The same Spirit that knew how to please
them, can give them comfort; He makes
their Miseries less troublesome, as he ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
their Pleasures more agreeable; he
manages his Service ingeniously without
staining his Fidelity, or injuring his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune;
he serves more conveniently for
himself, and more to the advantage of his
Friends.</p>
            <p>Oftentimes he is less discouraged, than
those who seek their own glory in assisting
others, who aim at nothing but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
themselves by Marks of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy,
and who prefer the noise of a good
Action before the good of those whom
they oblige.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="277" facs="tcp:44396:147"/>Of these two sorts of Persons, the one
make an appearance of being at a distance
from the unfortunate to the end of serving
them the better, the others run after them
to be their Conduct. Whilst the first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
themselves, and only think how to
relieve the afflicted, the others love no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
so much as to exercise a cruel and
imperious Generosity, and to insult over
those, that stand in need of their Credit.</p>
            <p>I have gone too far in this Discourse. I
go to conclude by the Opinion one should
have of Favourites.</p>
            <p>Methinks their greatness ought not to
dazle our Eyes; in our Souls we may
judge of them, as the rest of Men; to
esteem them, or undervalue them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their merit, to respect them or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
them according to the good or ill they
do to us: never to be wanting in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
that's due to them, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
carefully the displeasures they give us:
and when Honour or Interest would carry
us to Revenge, to respect the Inclination
of the Master in the Person of the Enemy.
Not to confound the publick good with
our own, and never to make a Civil War
of a particular Quarrel.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="278" facs="tcp:44396:148"/>To despise them, to hate them, these
are free Motions so long as they are kept
secret: as these Motions are in us, they
depend <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pon us alone; but when they
carry us to things wherein the State is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved,
we owe to that an account of our
Actions, and the Justice of the State hath
its Rights upon such Criminal Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings.</p>

Study has something of dullness in it,

that those Agreements, which proceed

               <pb n="279" facs="tcp:44396:148"/>I know very well that your Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

when you exist no more here.
'Tis a design that appears very reasonable,
it is even necessary; but you ought to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply

and by a better Motive than you do. Our

which, according to your sense, ought to
be our continual business.</p>
            <p>But tell me, I entreat you, can you
imagine that those Philosophers, whose
Works you read with so much Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
have found what you enquire after?
They have searcht it as you do, Sir, but
they have searcht it in vain.</p>
            <p>Don't suppose that the Ingenuous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of the past Ages lived at Random;
your Curiosity has been of all Ages; the
most stupid Men at this time have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
with the same Desire as you have;
the most Passionate return sometimes to
these Thoughts, the Libertines themselves
can't be prevented from making some Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
therein; no Man is insensible of
an Interest so general, and of so much
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:44396:149"/>
Consequence; every one meditates there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but with little advantage: Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that after having dreamt to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
one finds that it is Wisdom to dream
no longer, and to submit to the Orders of
Providence.</p>
            <p>The Author of Nature was not pleased
to let us be perfectly acquainted with our
selves; and amongst desires too curious of
knowing all, he has reduced us to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of knowing scarce any thing, and
of being ignorant of our selves.</p>
            <p>He gives Life to the Springs of our
Soul, but he conceals from us the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Secret that makes them move;
and this Knowing Maker reserves to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
the sole intelligence of his Work.</p>
            <p>He hath placed us in the midst of an
Infinity of Objects, with Senses capable of
being affected therewith: He has given us
Spirits that make continual Efforts to be
acquainted with them. Our Curiosity is
raised to the very Heavens; we observe
the Course of the Stars almost with as
much exactness, as the Motions of a Clock.
Astronomers have certain Rules to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
Eclipses Two Thousand Years before
they happen; and by the means of great
Perspectives, which Invention becomes
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:44396:149"/>
more perfect every Day, they discover new
Planets, and determine the different Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
thereof. In a word, they remark
Spots in the Sun, and Irregularities in
what God hath made most Regular in the
World.</p>
            <p>Although these things are much beyond
us, they are not beyond our Spirit; but
our Spirit is above it self, and after it has
comprehended the whole Universe, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
comprehend it self, but in adoring
him that hath made it; and as soon as it
Would know it self, it intrenches upon
the Rights of its Creator.</p>
            <p>I have an Opinion, that you will not
approve of. I believe it notwithstanding
to be true enough: It is, That no Person
has ever well apprehended, by the sole
Lights of Humane Reason, whether the
Soul be Immortal, or subject to Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>It is our Interest to believe its Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,
but it is not easie to conceive it:
my Intention is not to go far into a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Dispute; it were necessary to be of
another Humour than I am, and to be
better prepared. Let us leave <hi>M</hi> ... and
<hi>M</hi> ... to make whole Volumes by their
Frivolous Reasonings upon the Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:44396:150"/>
of the Soul. The Examples of those,
whose precepts you study, are to me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of Proofs, and perswade me more
than all the Arguments of our Doctors.</p>
            <p>'Tis not to be disputed, but that <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
believed the Soul Immortal; we see it
in what remains of the History of his
Life; and even the Thoughts which <hi>Plato</hi>
attributes to him, seem to confirm it. If
so be you are curious, notwithstanding
you will see that <hi>Socrates</hi> is a Jesting Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that diverts himself with all things,
and makes use of reasoning to shew that
one cannot even know, what Reason is.
He takes every Party you'll have him,
whether it be to defend or attack. With
the Evasions of his Arguments, and the
Sophistry of Logick, he puts probability in
the place of truth, and dazles his Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
in such a manner, by the various
colours he gives to things, that he reduces
them to the being no longer able to
distinguish the Shadow from the Body:
but in spite of his nice Ralleries, and all
his Subterfuges, he perplexes himself very
often in the Conclusions he infers, and is
so much dissatisfied with himself, that he
tears off his very Hair and Eye-lids for
Vexation, because he could not find what
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:44396:150"/>
he sought after. If you urge him to speak
sincerely, he will tell you, That the God,
who hath named him the Wisest of Men,
gives him an Encomium that doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to him, unless he deserves the name
of the Wisest, that confesses he knows no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
and that 'tis impossible to know
any thing.</p>
            <p>He will tell you, That the <hi>Daemon,</hi> who
inspires him, is not enough informed of
the news of the other World, to decide
the Question of the Immortality of the
Soul. He disputes of it before his Judges,
like a Person that desires it, and handles
Annihilation as a Philosopher that fears it
not.</p>
            <p>After having endeavoured to perswade
his Friends in the Prison, 'tis plainly
seen that he could not assure himself there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
He ends his Discourse with Doubts,
and all his Arguments tend to avert from
his Mind the Image of Death.</p>
            <p>From whence, do you think, proceed
the Contradictions which appear upon
that Subject, in the Writings of <hi>Aristotle</hi>
and <hi>Seneca?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for <hi>Aristotle,</hi> I have no design to cry
down his Doctrine, and to use him as a
Poisoner. I believe, as well as you, that
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:44396:151"/>
it is a Calumny, and that the <hi>Roman
Emperor,</hi> whom you speak of, was foolish
enough in causing the Books of this Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher
to be burnt, to revenge <hi>Alexander</hi>
above Three Hundred Years after his
Death. But amongst us, one is not
cautious of saying that he is a Sophister,
that seldom speaks like an honest Man:
He Bites and Flings; he is Ungrateful to
his Master, and Captious with his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.
He is a Dreamer, that fences with
his own Shadow, and makes Monsters
for himself to engage with. It may be
he is accused with Reason, that when he
explains his idle fancies, he doth like the
Fish, that disturbs the Water for fear of
being taken: he intangles himself in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
which he cannot unravel. He
plays the Mysterious to hide his Doubts.
In a word, he speaks like the Oracles to
puzzle the World, and is puzzled himself
with his own Arguments. I say nothing
here, but what others have said before
me. How many Fortunes do you think
his Writings have run through to come to
us? If you appeal to his best Friends, the
greatest part of the Works, that are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to him, is not his own: but
allowing all that has been said of him
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:44396:151"/>
not to be true, you must not believe, that
at those Privileged Hours when <hi>Aristotle</hi>
permitted none to come to him, but
some particular Persons, he taught the
same things he delivered in publick. His
Morning Thoughts did not resemble
those of the Evening. So soon as the
Gates of the <hi>Lycaeum</hi> were shut, and that
he thought himself at Liberty, he spoke
another Language. 'Tis there he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
much more clearly, than he doth
in his Treatise of the Soul, that nothing
is more impenetrable than its Nature,
its Original, and its Duration. Thus,
when <hi>Alexander</hi> was angry that he had
published some Works, that he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
for him alone: Don't afflict your
self, answered this cunning Tutor; I have
taken good order to prevent their being
comprehended; they are not made to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
the present Age, but to exercise
Posterity.</p>
            <p>As for what relates to <hi>Seneca,</hi> you will
agree that he is a Braggadocio, that
shakes for fear at the prospect of Death;
that he collects all his forces to assure his
Countenance, in the cutting of his Veins;
and that he speaks as a Man, who is not
altogether perswaded of what he says.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="286" facs="tcp:44396:152"/>Sometimes these Philosophers tell us
wonders of the Residence of the Gods,
and the Ultimate Bliss: sometimes they
know not where to harbour them, and
say, That all things annihilate in Death, as
far as Death it self. Now they promise
themselves Immortality, and promise it
to others. Now they turn it into Ridicule.
This is so true, that <hi>Aristotle</hi> is expell'd
<hi>Athens</hi> for an Atheist, and <hi>Seneca</hi> laughs
at a Divinity in the Deifying of <hi>Claudius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From whence, do you think, proceeds
this Diversity in their Opinions? It is,
that they are troubled with different Idea's
of present Death, and future Life; their
Soul unc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rtain upon the knowledge of
it self, establisheth or overthrows its Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
according as it is seduced by the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
appearances of truth. If you
hearken to these Talkers, they'll do their
utmost to make you believe them. Assure
your self, Sir, that the most resolute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them are no more than Quacks,
that swallow down the Poison with a b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Grace than others, to the end of sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
off their Drugs with more applause.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Epicurus</hi> makes an open Profession of
putting the Sovereign good in the Senses,
and teaches that all things conclude with
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:44396:152"/>
them: notwithstanding, doth he not seem
in dying to contradict the Maxims, which
he made Profession of during his Life?
He makes his Will with all the Cautions
of a Man, that's concerned at what
will happen after him. Posterity has
an influence upon him, his Memory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
dear to him, he cannot wean him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
from the Delights of his Garden, he
flatters himself with the Reputation of
his Writings, and recommends them to
his Disciple <hi>Hermachus.</hi> His Mind, which
was so far engaged in the Opinion of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation,
is affected with some tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for himself, and lays up Honours and
Pleasures in another State, besides that he
goes to leave.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solomon,</hi> who was the greatest of all
Kings, and the wisest of all Men, seems
to furnish the Impious wherewith to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain
their Errors, at a time when he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vises
the good Men to remain firm in the
love of truth.</p>
            <p>When he makes the Libertines speak in
<hi>Ecclesiastes,</hi> is it not plain that he appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priates
to Wisdom alone the knowledge of
our selves? He forms all the Doubts,
wherein for the most part Humane Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is perplexed; he makes a downright
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:44396:153"/>
Description of his Irresolution, his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
his Distastes, his Knowledge, his Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance;
and at length concludes that Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Wisdom alone can disentangle this La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinth;
that we must adore the Profun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
of its Mysteries, and that the silence
of a Wise Man, is of more value than the
Arguments of a Philosopher.</p>
            <p>If any one ought to have been exempt
from Error, Doubt, Inconstancy, it was
<hi>Solomon:</hi> Notwithstanding we see in the
inequality of his Conduct, that he was
weary of his Wisdom, that he was
weary of his Folly, and that his Vertues
and his Vices turn by turn gave him
new Disgusts. Sometimes he enjoy'd his
Life, as if all things went at random;
sometimes he brought back all things to
Providence, and never spoke with a firm
tone, but when Eternal Wisdom made
him speak.</p>
            <p>Let the Philosophers, let the Learned
study, they will oftentimes find an Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and now and then an absolute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety
in their Judgments. Unless Faith
subjects our Reason, we pass our Lives in
Belief and Unbelief; in endeavouring to
perswade our selves, and unable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
us: the activity of our Spirit gives
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:44396:153"/>
us Motion enough, but its Lights are too
dim to conduct us.</p>
            <p>The one amorous of themselves help
their Imagination to flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
they think to have found what
they seek for, they triumph some time
in their Error, but are undeceived in the
end.</p>
            <p>The others are vexed at their Ignorance,
every thing stops them, nothing satisfies
them; they debate upon all Questions
that are put to them: more unhappy
in this than the former, in as much as
they have not the Wit to deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
            <p>This is it, Sir, in my Judgment, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
consists the purest Wisdom; provided
that one is always deceived, provided that
one is puzzled with every thing that's dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult,
and that one thinks of the future
only to reap the more advantage of the
present, provided at length that one has
reduced his Reason to dispute no more
upon things that God was not pleased
to submit to reasoning, is all that one can
desire.</p>
            <p>I not only believe with <hi>Solomon,</hi> that
the silence of a Wise Man, in this case, is
of more account, than the Discourse of a
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:44396:154"/>
Philosopher, but I esteem the Faith of a
stupid Peasant, more than all the Lessons
of <hi>Socrates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know very well, that Examples might
be brought, which seem contrary to what
I say. There are Pagans perswaded of
the other Opinion; and affected to their
own Sentiments. A Discourse upon the
Immortality of the Soul, hath push'd
on some even to brave the horrors of
Death, the better to enjoy those Pleasures
of Life, which were promised to them.</p>
            <p>But not to displease the Partisans of the
Vertue of the Pagans, I believe, with
some great Saints, that Vain-glory made
more than half of those Heroick Actions,
which cause our Admiration. When one
comes to these terms, 'tis no more reason that
conducts us, 'tis Passion that draws us along;
'tis no more the Discourse that has an
effect upon us, 'tis a desire to be better, 'tis
a vanity to die with courage, which we
love more than Life it self; 'tis a weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of present Misfortunes, 'tis a hope
of future Rewards, a blind Love of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
in a word, a Distemper, a Fury that
doth violence to natural Instinct, and
transports us beyond our selves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="291" facs="tcp:44396:154"/>But a peaceable Mind, that examines
in cold Blood this terrible Alteration,
is not at all disturbed by the reading of
<hi>Plato,</hi> or <hi>Seneca.</hi> They may preach up,
That Death is not an evil; if Grace doth
not come to its relief, they don't deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
it to us. It belongs only to the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign
Master of Reason, to make Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,
to inspire a courageous Contempt for
false advantages, and to perswade upon
his word that he prepares real ones for
us.</p>
            <p>I repeat it the last time, Sir; study as
much as you please to know your self, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
all your Books, consume your finest
days in reflecting upon the Immortality of
the Soul, you will find that it belongs
only to Religion to decide it. As for me,
I confess to you, That without that,
the thoughts of Eternity would never
take up the most useless Moments of my
Life.</p>

            <pb n="292" facs="tcp:44396:155"/>
            <head>OF
STUDY
AND
CONVERSATION.</head>
            <p>COnversation is an advantage peculiar
to Man, as well as Reason. It is
the Bond of Society, by it is entertained
the Commerce of a Civil Life; the Minds
communicate their Thoughts, the Hearts
express their Motions, and Friendships are
contracted and kept up by the same.</p>
            <p>The Conversation of two Friends ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
their Happiness and their Misfortunes
common; it augments their Pleasures,
and decreases their Afflictions. Nothing
alleviates Grief so much, as the liberty of
Complaining; nothing makes one more
sensible of Joy, than the Delight of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
it. In a word, Man is so far born
to be sociable, that this Quality is no less
essential to him, than Reason.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="293" facs="tcp:44396:155"/>To fly from Company, is to act against
the Intention of Nature; to live always
in Solitude, one must be something more
than Man, or less than Brute: There is
a sort of Communication amongst them.
Many Philosophers have affirmed that
Beasts have a particular Language, and
several Experiments have given occasion to
believe it.</p>
            <p>However it is very true, that there are
no Beasts upon Earth so wild, as some
certain Men that make a Profession of
Contempt and Aversion for all Mankind:
like that extravagant Citizen of <hi>Athens,</hi>
who spoke to no one to any other intent,
than to advise him to hang himself, and
took care to make his Epitaph so, as to
curse Men after his Death.</p>
            <p>One must have a Mind blemish'd with
Melancholy, to lead a Savage Life, and
always in obscurity. I don't pretend to
blame those, whose Silence and Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
our Religion has Consecrated; on
the contrary, I admire them. The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
which has disposed them to chuse a
Life so repugnant to Nature, obliges us to
have them in Veneration. As there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more extraordinary, than the Vertue
of a true Solitary Person, so there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:44396:156"/>
more inimitable, and which better
deserves our Commendations.</p>
            <p>But it is certain, that amongst those,
whom a real Vocation, or a Fancy that
one sometimes takes to it, have cast into
a dislike of the World, there is found but
very few that persevere in their Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the end, with the same zeal.
The State of a Solitary Person, is a violent
State for Man. Natural Instinct, which
makes him love Society, makes it self at
length the Master, and causes to him from
time to time some concern for having
for saken it. After all, to be concealed all
ones Life, is that living? What distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is there between Death and Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
between Solitude and the Grave?</p>
            <p>To live then as Man, 'tis necessary to
converse with Men; 'tis fit Conversation
should be the most agreeable Pleasure of
Life; but 'tis also fit, that it should be
confined. One ought to enjoy it with
Choice, and moderate the use of it with Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion.
There is nothing more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous,
and nothing more dangerous:
as a too long Retirement weakens the
Mind, so too frequent Company con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes
it. It is good sometimes to recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
himself; it is even necessary to render
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:44396:156"/>
an exact account of his Words, of his
Thoughts to himself, and of the progress
he hath made in Wisdom. To reap the
fruits of his reading, and the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
he hath had, to improve by what
he has seen, he must have Silence, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
and Meditation.</p>
            <p>There must be a time for Study, and
also for Affairs, that are tied to our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.
Conversation cannot take up our
whole Life; these two other Duties de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
to be preferred before it. Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
is always disgraceful to a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
his Condition doth not excuse him,
and the World doth not instruct him e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.
When one knows how to make
an equal mixture of all these things, he
must distinguish himself extreamly from
those that apply themselves to but one
of them.</p>
            <p>Study is the most solid Nourishment of
the Mind; 'tis the Spring of its most
Noble Qualities: 'tis Study that augments
the Faculties of Nature; but 'tis Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
that sets them on Work, and refines
them. It is the great Book of the World,
that teaches the Good Use of other Books,
and can make of a Learned Man, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
Gentleman.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="296" facs="tcp:44396:157"/>In a word, Study makes a greater dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between a Scholar and an ignorant
Man, than there is between an ignorant
Man and a Brute: but the Air of the
World yet makes a greater distinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
a Polite and a learned Person.
Knowledge begins the Gentleman, and the
Correspondence of the World compleats
him.</p>
            <p>It has been observed notwithstanding,
That extraordinary Genius's have passed
of a sudden from the Meditation of the
Closet to the most difficult Charges: but
these Men can't be brought for Examples.
When a Man, intoxicated with reading,
makes his first step in the World, 'tis usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a false one. If he advises himself by
his Books alone, he runs the hazard of
being always but an ungenteel Man.
Immoderate Study engenders a grossness
in the Mind, and injures his Sentiments;
the Conversation of our Friends must
assist and refine him.</p>
            <p>To meet with a faithful, understanding,
discreet Friend, is to be happy: faithful,
to conceal nothing from us; understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
to remark our faults; and discreet,
to reprehend us for them. But to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
to believe his Counsels, is the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:44396:157"/>
of Happiness: it happens often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
that we take a pride in following
our own Conceits; like those Travellers,
that lose their way for want of taking a
Guide, or enquiring for the Road.</p>
            <p>It is true, that a Man who is sensible
of his force, and knows the advantages of
his Mind, that a Man (I say) who
aspires to Glory, and will raise his Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
ought to dread, as a Rock, to be
suspected of being governed.</p>
            <p>Dependance is insupportable to a Man
of Courage, especially that of the Mind.
When one would exercise a sort of Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
upon the freest part of the Soul, it is
difficult not to revolt against Reason,
through Malice against him that argues.</p>
            <p>There is need of as much Discretion to
give advice, as Compliance to follow it:
nothing is so dreadful as a Friend, that
takes the advantage of his own Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that proposes all his Counsels as
Laws, and with the Air of a Master, that
takes from us the Privilege of examining
what he says, and would force the Mind
by Authority, rather than win it by
Discourse. He never fails to give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:44396:158"/>
for an Example. He applys to all
purposes the Observations of the old Court.
He brings his own adventures for Proofs,
he has seen all that he advances, every
thing that he says is extravagant, and the
fear of not saying enough to perswade,
makes him always say too much to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.</p>
            <p>Yet, a great weakness in receiving ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
is not less blameable, than a great
roughness in giving it. It is our Interest
to surmount the one, and to sweeten the
other. Sometimes we should assist the
liberty of him that informs us, by accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Counsels with easiness.</p>
            <p>A good Advice loseth its force in the
Mouth of a Friend, that's too Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaisant;
when he expresses himself with
strength, he stirs up our Hearts the more,
he incites our attention the better; whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
Remedies seldom have an agreeable
Taste, and the best humoured Physicians
are not always the most assistant.</p>
            <p>We ought to look upon our selves as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
so long as we have need of Advice.
Alas! who has no need of it? If the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
is good, why should we reject it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is not delivered with a good Grace?
We ought to consider, whether it may be
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:44396:158"/>
of any advantage to us, before we cast
it aside: it is not proper to reject even all
the evil Counsels, for fear of disheartning
those, that are capable of administring
good ones to us.</p>
            <p>At the worst, when we shall reap from
them no other Fruit, than to learn how
to overcome our nicety, and to take from
our selves what's displeasing to us in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
is it not sufficent to oblige us to
give ear to them, and to acknowledge our
thankfulness?</p>
            <p>An ill Example may serve to make us
avoid evil, as a good one to excite us to
that which is good: let us reap the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of it from whatsoever part it
comes, of whatsoever Fashion 'tis given
to us.</p>
            <p>'Tis our business to distinguish Gold
from Earth, we find it seldom pure, but
'tis ne'er the less Gold: 'tis the fault of the
Workman, not the Metal.</p>
            <p>One meets sometimes with Men of an
exquisite Sense, that have not the gift of
explaining themselves. One ought to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
with the defect of their Expression,
and take the benefit of their Good Sense.
Others have an easiness of Speech, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
insist upon the outside of things. Let us
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:44396:159"/>
imitate what's good in their Language, and
pierce further into the Truth.</p>
            <p>There are still others, that have labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all their Life to render themselves inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious,
and could not make themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable:
we esteem their knowledge, but
their way is of little account with us: we
should be glad of improving our selves by
their learning, but will not endure their
ill humours.</p>
            <p>A little distast hinders us from reaping
all the advantage, that one might, from
their Conversation; we prefer the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of an ignorant Flatterer before the
Conversation of a learned Man, when he
is morose and severe. The Authority,
which he takes over us, is indeed trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some;
but is it not a privilege acquired
by Age? If he lets us partake of what he
knows, is it too much to acknowledge him,
to have a seeming Submission to his Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?</p>
            <p>Yet I would not have this Submission
blind, it is just to reserve to our selves the
liberty of reflecting upon what he says:
but we must answer him with a great deal
of observance: we ought not to contradict
him, but to instruct our selves the better;
one should comply with Reason, as soon
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:44396:159"/>
as it appears, and find it agreeable even in
the Mouth of a Pedant.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding, we are not to receive
his Doctrine, as infallible; we are not to
establish an Opinion upon that of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
for 'tis in the Faith alone one
ought to swear upon the words of a
Master.</p>
            <p>To know things Judiciously, we ought
always to be upon our guard against the
Reputation of him that speaks them;
the Air of the Face, the manner of Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the Quality, the Time, the Place, all
imposes. You hear the Court exclaim
against all the words of ... be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he sometimes delivers those that are
good. Admiration is the Mark of a little
Spirit, and the great admirers are for the
most part very silly People. They want
to be informed, when 'tis proper to laugh;
the Pit, that has no other assistance, than

            <p>The greatest Secret then to succeed in
Conversation, is, to admire little, to hear
much, always to distrust our own Reason,
and sometimes that of our Friends; never
to pretend to ingenuity, to make that of
others appear as much as one can, to
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:44396:160"/>
hearken to what is said, and to answer to
the purpose. In a word, to practise the

            <head>A Discourse upon the Word
VAST, to the Gentlemen
of the Academy.</head>
            <p>AFter having condemned my self upon
the Word <hi>Vast,</hi> I was perswaded
that one ought to be contented with my
Recantation: But since the Gentlemen of
the Academy have thought fit to add their
Censure to mine, I declare that my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owning
was not sincere; 'twas a pure
effect of Compliance, and a voluntary
Submission of my Thoughts to those of
Madam <hi>Mazarin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I take up my Defence against
them, which I had quitted upon her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
which every Gentleman might
take a pride in having lost. One may
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:44396:160"/>
dispute with the Gentlemen of the Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy
the privilege of regulating our
Language, as they please. It doth not
depend upon Authors to abolish <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>old
Terms because they dislike them, and
to introduce new ones according to
their Fancy; all that may be done for
them, is to render them Masters of Use,
when that Use is not contrary to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Reason.</p>
            <p>There have been Authors that have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
Languages, there have been also those
that have corrupted them, and one must
have recourse to a good Sense to decide
the matter.</p>
            <p>Never had <hi>Rome</hi> such noble Genius's, as
at the latter end of the Republick: The
reason is, That there was yet liberty e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
amongst the <hi>Romans</hi> to give force
to their Spirits; and Luxury enough to
give them negligence and agreeableness.</p>
            <p>At this time, when the beauty of the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
was in the highest degree; this time,
when there was at <hi>Rome</hi> such great Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us's,
as <hi>Caesar, Salust, Cicero, Hortensius,
Brutus, Asinius Pollio, Curio, Catullus,
Atticus,</hi> and many others, whom 'twould
be of no importance to alledge; it was
just to submit to their Opinions, and to
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:44396:161"/>
receive their Decisions with Compliance:
but when the Language came to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
under the Emperours, when <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi>
came to be preferred to <hi>Virgil,</hi> and
<hi>Seneca</hi> to <hi>Cicero,</hi> was any one obliged to
subject the liberty of his Judgment to the
Authority of those that made the Men of
Parts? And <hi>Petronius</hi> is not he commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by all judicious Persons, for having
turned into Ridicule the Eloquence of
his Time, for having known the false
Judgment of his Age, and given to <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero,
Virgil,</hi> and <hi>Horace,</hi> all the Praises that
they deserved?</p>
            <q>
               <l>Tertiis, Cicero, Virgilius,</l>
               <l>Horatii curiosa foelicitas.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Let us proceed from our <hi>Latin</hi> Authors
to our <hi>French.</hi> When <hi>Nerveze</hi> made his
false Eloquence to be admired, would not
the Court have been under an Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to any person of good Sense, that had
undeceived it? When <hi>Coiffeteau</hi> was seen
to charm all the World with his Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors,
and that the chief sails of his
Eloquence passed for wonderful: When
the Florid Language of ... which had
neither force nor solidity, affected all the
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:44396:161"/>
false Polite, and pretended Curious: When
the affectation of <hi>Balsac,</hi> that undermined
the natural Beauty of his Thoughts, passed
for a Majestick, Noble Style; should not
one have rendred an important Service to
the Publick, by withstanding the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
that these Gentlemen usurped, and by
preventing the ill Opinions that each of
them hath differently established in his
own Time?</p>
            <p>I confess, That one has not the same
privilege against the Gentlemen of the
Academy. <hi>Vaugelas, Ablancour, Patru,</hi>
have put our Language in its Perfection,
and I make no Question but that our
present Authors will keep it up in the same
Condition wherein they have left it. But
if one day a false Idea of Politeness
should make our Discourse feeble and
languishing, if by too great a love for
making Histories, and writing News, one
should study for an affected easiness,
which can be nothing else but a false Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
if so be a too great Application
to purity should at length produce some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of dryness: if to pursue always the
Method of Thought, one should take
from our Language the fine turn it bears,
and depriving it of all Ornament, one
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:44396:162"/>
should make it barbarous, with an intent
to render it natural; would not it be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
then to oppose Corrupters, that
would subvert the good and true Style,
to form one as little proper to express
strong Imaginations, as curious Thoughts?</p>
            <p>What have I to do to recall what's past,
or to foresee the future? I acknowledge
the Jurisdiction of the Academy, and
would have it decide, whether <hi>Vast</hi> be
in use, or no. I will submit to their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
But to know the force and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
of the term, to be satisfied whether
'tis an Imputation, or an Honour, they
will permit me to refer my self to Reason.
This small Discourse will shew, if I have
the Notion of it.</p>
            <p>I maintained, That in the Mind this
term <hi>Vast</hi> was taken in a good or evil Sence,
according to the things which are added to
it; that a Vast Mind, Admirable, Pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
mark'd a wonderful Capacity; and
that on the other side, a Genius Vast and
Immoderate, was a Genius that lost it self
in rambling Thoughts, in fine but vain
Idea's, in designs too great, and little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned
to the means that might make us
succeed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="307" facs="tcp:44396:162"/>My Opinion appears to me to be mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
enough. I am dispos'd to deny that
<hi>Vast</hi> can ever be a Commendation, and
that nothing is capable of making this qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
true. <hi>Great</hi> is a Perfection in Minds.
<hi>Vast</hi> always a Reproach. A just and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated
extent makes the <hi>Great;</hi> an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate
Grandeur makes the <hi>Vast.
Vastitas,</hi> an excessive greatness. The
<hi>Vast</hi> and the <hi>Terrible</hi> have a great resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Vast</hi> Things don't suit with those, that
make upon us an agreeable Impression.
<hi>Vasta solitudo,</hi> is not one of those Solitudes,
which affords a delicious Repose, which
charms the Pains of Lovers, and enchants
the Misfortunes of the Miserable; 'tis a
barbarous Solitude, where we are asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
at being alone, where we regret
the loss of Company, where the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of lost Pleasures afflicts us, and the
Sense of present Misfortunes torments us.
Your Vast House is somewhat formidable
to the sight. Vast Appartments never
gave any Person a desire of continuing
there: Vast Gardens cannot have that
agreement which proceeds from Art, or
the Graces which Nature might afford.
Vast Forests put us in a Fright. The

            <p>
               <hi>Vastus</hi> has pass'd as far as Customs and

            <p>
               <hi>Cato,</hi> who had otherwise so many good
Qualities, was a Person <hi>vastis moribus,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the <hi>Romans.</hi> He had nothing of
Elegance in his Discourse, nothing of
Grace either in his Person, or his Actions:
He had a rustical and harsh Behaviour in
all things. The <hi>Germans,</hi> at present civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized
and polished in many places, loved
heretofore that what was in use with
them, should have something of <hi>vastness.</hi>
Their Habitation, their Attendance, their
Equipage, their Assemblies, their Festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals,
<hi>vastum aliquid redolebant;</hi> that is to
say, they were pleased with an immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
greatness, wherein there was neither
Politeness, nor Ornament. I have obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
That the word <hi>Vast</hi> hath four or five
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:44396:164"/>
different Significations in <hi>Cicero,</hi> all in an
evil Sence.</p>
            <p>Vasta Solitudo, vastus &amp; agrestis, vasta
&amp; immanis bellua, vastam &amp; hiantem ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem.</p>
            <p>The most usual Signification of <hi>vastus,</hi>
is, too spacious, too extensive, too great,
immoderate.</p>
            <p>One will tell me, That <hi>vast</hi> doth not
signifie in <hi>French,</hi> what <hi>vastus</hi> may signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
in <hi>Latin,</hi> in all the sences that are
given to it. I confess it. But why should it
not keep the most natural, as well as grief,
pleasure, liberty, favour, honour, affliction,
consolation, and a Thousand words of
this nature keep theirs? There is a reason
for <hi>vast,</hi> that is not found in the rest; it is
that there never was a <hi>French</hi> Term that
expresses really and truly, what the
<hi>vastus</hi> of the <hi>Latins</hi> can express; and we
have not made it <hi>French</hi> to encrease a
number of words, which signifie the same
thing; it is to give our Language what
it wanted, and what rendred it defective.
We think with more force, than we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
our selves. There is always a part of
our Thought that stays behind; we very
seldom communicate it entirely; and 'tis
by this Spirit of Penetration, more than
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:44396:164"/>
by the Intelligence of words, that we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
absolutely into the Conception of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.
In the mean time as if we should
profess to understand well what others
think, or to make our own Thoughts
comprehended, we should weaken the
Terms that would have the force of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
them. But in spite of our selves,
<hi>vast</hi> will preserve in <hi>French</hi> the true signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
it has in <hi>Latin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One says too <hi>vast,</hi> as one says too <hi>inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,</hi>
too <hi>extravagant,</hi> too <hi>covetous,</hi> and
'tis the excess of a vicious Quality. One
doth not say <hi>vast</hi> enough, because enough
marks a Situation, a Consistence, a Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
just and reasonable; and at the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that a thing is <hi>vast,</hi> there is an
excess, there is too much, enough can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be agreeable with it. Let us come to
examine particularly the <hi>vast</hi> Soul, since
'tis the subject of the Question. That
which we call the Soul, is divided into
Three Faculties, the Judgment, the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
and the Imagination.</p>
            <p>A Judgment may be commended for
being Solid, Profound, Curious in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning,
just in defining; but in my
Opinion, never did a Person of good sence
give to it the Quality of <hi>vast.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="312" facs="tcp:44396:165"/>One says, That a Memory is happy,
faithful, fit to receive and preserve Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies:
but I never observed, that it has
been named <hi>vast.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vast</hi> may be applied to an Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that rambles, that loses it self, that
forms to it self Visions and Chimaera's.</p>
            <p>I am not ignorant, that some have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to praise <hi>Aristotle,</hi> in attributing to
him a <hi>vast</hi> Genius; they have believed,
that this very Quality of <hi>vast,</hi> was a great
Commendation for <hi>Homer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One says, That <hi>Alexander, Pyrrhus, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiline,
Caesar, Charles</hi> the Fifth, and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
<hi>Richlieu,</hi> had <hi>vast</hi> Souls; but if
we take the pains to examine well all they
have done, we shall find that their fine
Pieces, their brave Exploits should be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to other Qualities of their Minds,
and that their Errors and Faults ought to
be imputed to what they had of <hi>vast.</hi> I
acknowledge it: But it was their Vice,
and a Vice that is not pardonable, but in
Consideration of their Vertues. It is the
error of our Judgment to make their
merit of a thing that cannot be excused
but by Indulgence. If they had not been
almost always Great, they would not
have been suffered to be sometimes <hi>vast.</hi>
               <pb n="313" facs="tcp:44396:165"/>
But let us come to the Examination of
their Works and their Actions, let us give
to each Quality the Effects that really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to it, and begin with the Works of
<hi>Aristotle.</hi> His Poetry is one of the most
finished; but to what are owing so many
Judicious Precepts, and so many Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
so just, but to the purity of his
Judgment? one will not say, That it was
to his <hi>vast</hi> Soul. In his Politicks, which
might guide our present Legislators, he
is wise, prudent and skillful in regulating
the different Constitutions of States: He
was by no means <hi>vast.</hi> No Body ever
pierced so far as he into the Heart of Man,
as one may see in his Morals, and in his
Speculation, in the Chapter of the Passions.
But he entred therein as a Philosopher,
that knows how to make profound Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections,
that had studied much his own
Motions, and strictly observed those of
others. Don't found the Merit of <hi>Vast</hi>
upon that, for it had no Share therein.
<hi>Aristotle</hi> had properly a <hi>vast</hi> Genius in
Natural Philosophy, and 'tis from thence,
that proceed all his Errors, by that he is
lost in his Principle, in his own Matter,
in the Heavens, in the Stars, and in the
rest of his false Opinions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="314" facs="tcp:44396:166"/>As for <hi>Homer,</hi> he is admirable as long
as he is purely Humane, just in his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters,
Natural in Passions, wonderful
in knowing and expressing well, what
depends upon our Nature.</p>
            <p>When his <hi>vast</hi> Genius is extended upon
that of the Gods, he speaks thereof so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagantly,
that <hi>Plato</hi> excluded him from
his Republick, for a Fool.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seneca</hi> was to blame for treating <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
as a rash Person, that owed his Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur
to his Fortune.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plutarch,</hi> seems to me to be rational,
when he attributes the Conquests of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
to his Vertue, more than to his
good Fortune.</p>
            <p>In Effect, consider <hi>Alexander</hi> at his
coming to the Crown, you will find,
that he had not less Conduct, than Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
to establish himself in the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
of his Father. The Contempt they
made of the Prince's Youth, carried his
Subjects to rebell, and his Neighbours to
be in Motion; he punished the Seditious,
and subjected the Restless.</p>
            <p>All Things being pacified, he took
Measures to make himself chosen General
of the <hi>Greeks</hi> against the <hi>Persians,</hi> and these
Measures were so well taken, that one
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:44396:166"/>
could not have expected more just ones
from the most consummated Policy; he
made the Lieutenants of <hi>Darius,</hi> and
<hi>Darius</hi> himself, commit a Thousand
Faults, without making one. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the
Greatness of his Courage had not made
him pass for a rash Man by the Dangers
which he exposed himself to, his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
would have left us the Idea of a
Wise and Prudent Man.</p>
            <p>I describe him to you, Great, and Skillful,
in every noble Thing he hath done. You
would have him <hi>Vast,</hi> and 'tis to this
<hi>Vast,</hi> that's owing all that he undertook
without Effect. A Desire of Glory, that
nothing could limit, caus'd him to make
a very extravagant War upon the <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians.</hi>
An immoderate Vanity perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him that he was the Son of <hi>Iupiter.
Vast</hi> extends as far as his affliction, when
it carried him to sacrifice entire Nations
to the Soul of <hi>Hephestion.</hi> After he had
destroyed the Empire of <hi>Darius,</hi> and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
<hi>Babylon,</hi> he could even attempt
the Conquest of the World we are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with; but his <hi>vast</hi> Soul framed
the Design of the Conquest of another.
As <hi>Vast,</hi> he undertook his Expedition of
the <hi>Indies,</hi> where the Army would aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don

Few Princes have had one so <hi>vast</hi>

that Conversation that is known by
all, is a sufficient Argument of it. His Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
his Experience in War made him
win Battels; his <hi>vast</hi> Mind that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
all Things, did not permit him
to arrive at the end of one; there was

            <p>What was impossible, appeared to him
but extraordinary, and the extraordinary
seem'd to him common and easie, <hi>Vastus
animus immoderata, incredibilia, nimis alta
cupiebat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And by that you see the Relation there
is between a <hi>vast</hi> Soul, and immoderate
things. Good Men condemn his Crime,
<hi>Politicians</hi> blame his Undertaking, as ill-contrived;
for all those, that had a Mind
to oppress the Commonwealth, except
him, have had for them the Favour of
the People, and the Assistance of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Catiline</hi> had neither one, nor t'other of
these Supports, his Industry and his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
served instead of all other things in so
great and so difficult an Affair. He him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:44396:168"/>
made an Army of collected Soldiers,
that had hardly any Arms, or Subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence;
and these Troops notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fought with more Obstinacy, than
ever Troops did. Each Soldier had the
Fierceness of <hi>Catiline</hi> in the Battel, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiline</hi>
the Capacity of a great Captain,
and the Stoutness of the bravest and most
resolute Soldier. Never did Man die
with so Noble a Fierceness.</p>
            <p>It's difficult even for the best Man, that
shall read this Battel, to be very much
of the Republick's side against him: im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
not to forget his Crime, to pity
his Misfortune.</p>
            <p>He might have securely gotten a great
Power according to the Laws.</p>
            <p>This ambitious Man so <hi>vast</hi> in Projects,
aspired always to Power, and at length
dispos'd himself to that Fatal Conspiracy,
which ruined him.</p>
            <p>Who was greater, more dextrous than
<hi>Caesar?</hi> What Address, what Industry did
not he use to send back an innumerable
Multitude of <hi>Switzers</hi> that endeavoured
to establish themselves amongst the <hi>Gauls?</hi>
He had as much need of Prudence as
Valour to get rid of, and send the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
far from him. He had an admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:44396:168"/>
Dexterity in managing the <hi>Gauls,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
over their particular Jealousies to
subject them one by another. Something
of <hi>Vast,</hi> that mingled in his Spirit with his
Noble Qualities, made him forsake his
ordinary Measures to undertake the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition
of <hi>England,</hi> a fantastical Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
vain for his Reputation, and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
inconvenient for his Interests.</p>
            <p>What Stratagems he made use of to raise
the Obstacles, that opposed the Design of
his Dominion. He undermined the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
of all the reputable Men, that could
support the Republick. He made <hi>Cicero</hi>
be banished by <hi>Clodius,</hi> who came to lie
with his Wife. He gave so much distaste
to <hi>Catullus</hi> and <hi>Lucullus,</hi> that they left
Business. He rendred the Integrity of
<hi>Cato</hi> odious, and the Greatness of <hi>Pompey</hi>
suspected. He raised the People against
those, that protected Liberty. Behold what
<hi>Caesar</hi> has done against the Defenders of
the State; see what he did to those, that
assisted him to overwhelm it. His Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
for factious Persons discovered it
self at the Conspiracy of <hi>Catiline;</hi> he was
a Friend of <hi>Catiline</hi>'s, and a secret accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice
of his Crime. He sought the Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of <hi>Clodius,</hi> a Man violent and rash.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="320" facs="tcp:44396:169"/>He contracted one with <hi>Crassus,</hi> more
a rich, than a good Citizen. He made
use of <hi>Pompey</hi> to acquire Credit. And
when it was debated to give Bounds to
his Authority, and to prevent the Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment
of his Power, he forgot nothing
to ruine <hi>Pompey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He placed <hi>Anthony</hi> in his Interests, he
gained <hi>Curio</hi> and <hi>Dolabella.</hi> He fixed to
himself <hi>Hirtius, Oppius, Balbus,</hi> and all
the disaffected Persons he could, all the
bold, undertaking ones, all that were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of procuring under him the ruine
of the Commonwealth. Measures so fine,
so artificial, Methods so secret and so deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
a condition so studied for in all things,
so much dissimulation, so many secrets,
cannot be attributed to a <hi>vast</hi> Soul; his
Faults, his Misfortunes, his Ruine, and
his Death can be imputed to nothing
else.</p>
            <p>It was this Soul that hindred him from
enslaving <hi>Rome</hi> as he could, or from ruling
it as he ought. 'Tis this, that gave him
the fancy of making War against the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi>
when there was more necessity of
assuring the <hi>Romans;</hi> in an uncertrin State,
where the <hi>Romans</hi> were neither Citizens
nor Subjects, where <hi>Caesar</hi> was neither Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate,
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:44396:169"/>
nor Tyrant; where he violated
all the Laws of the Republick, and could
not establish his own; being perplexed,
unsettled, dispersed into <hi>vast</hi> Idea's of his
Grandeur, not knowing how to rule his
Thoughts, nor his Affairs, he offended the
Senate, and trusted to the Senators; he
abandoned himself to faithless and ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Men, who preferring Liberty before all
Vertues, chose rather to have a Friend and
Benefactor, than to have a Master.</p>
            <p>Commend, Gentlemen, commend a <hi>vast</hi>
Soul, it has cost <hi>Caesar</hi> both his Empire and
his Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Beautru,</hi> who judged well enough of
the desert of Men, was accustomed to
prefer <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth before all Persons
that have existed in <hi>Europe,</hi> since the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>
I will not decide, but I may believe
that his Soul, his Courage, his Action, his
Vigour, his Magnanimity, and his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy
have rendred him as considerable as
any Prince of his Time.</p>
            <p>When he took upon him the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his Dominions, he found <hi>Spain</hi>
Revolted against Cardinal <hi>Ximenes,</hi> who
was Regent thereof. The severe Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
and obdurate Manners of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
were insupportable to the <hi>Spaniards.
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:44396:170"/>
Charles</hi> was obliged to come into <hi>Spain,</hi>
and affairs passing from the hands of
<hi>Ximenes</hi> to his own, all the Grandees re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
forthwith to their Duty, and all the
Cities to their Obedience. <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth
was more Politick, or more Fortunate than
<hi>Francis</hi> the First.</p>
            <p>In their Competition for the Empire,
<hi>Francis</hi> was more Rich, and more Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
<hi>Charles</hi> carried it by his Fortune, or
by the Superiority of his Genius. The Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
of <hi>Pavie</hi> and the taking of <hi>Rome</hi>
put into his hands a King of <hi>France,</hi> and a
Pope. A Triumph, that surpassed all
those of the <hi>Romans.</hi> The great League
of <hi>Smalcades</hi> was undermined by his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
and by his Valour. He changed all
the Posture of the Affairs of <hi>Germany,</hi> trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
the Electorship of <hi>Saxony</hi> from
one branch to another, and from <hi>Frederick</hi>
conquered and dispossess'd, to the House of
<hi>Maurice,</hi> who had followed the Victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
Religion it self was enslaved to
Victory, and received from the Will of
the Emperour the famous <hi>Interim,</hi> which
will be always talk'd of. But this <hi>vast</hi>
Soul embraced too many Things, to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
any one: he did not consider that he
could do more by others, than by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:44396:170"/>
and in the time when he thought to
have subdued <hi>Rome</hi> and the Empire,
<hi>Maurice</hi> turning against him the Armies
he seem'd to command for his Service,
was very near surprizing of him, obliged
him to save himself in his Shirt, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
in all diligence to <hi>Willac.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is certain that <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth had
great Qualities, and performed very great
Things; but this <hi>vast</hi> Soul, for which he
is applauded, made him commit many
Faults, and occasion'd to him many
Misfortunes. 'Tis to that are owing his
Fatal Undertakings in <hi>Africk;</hi> 'tis to that
are owing several Designs as ill contrived,
as they were ill followed; to that are ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
those Voyages from Nations to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
wherein there was less of Interest,
than Fancy. 'Tis this <hi>vast</hi> Soul, that
made him be called Knight-Errant by
the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and gave an occasion to
the disaffected to esteem him a greater
Travellour, than Conquerour. Admire,
Gentlemen, admire the Vertue of this
<hi>vast</hi> Spirit. It turns the Hero into a
Knight-Errant, and gives to Heroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Truths the Air of Fabulous Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="324" facs="tcp:44396:171"/>I could shew that this Spirit was the
cause of all the Disgraces of the last Duke
of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> as well as those of <hi>Charles
Emanuel,</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi> But I am im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
to come to Cardinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> to
discover in his Person the different effects
of <hi>great</hi> and <hi>vast.</hi> One may say of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
<hi>Richlieu,</hi> that he had a very great
Genius; and as Great, he brought extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Advantages to our State; but as
he was sometimes <hi>Vast,</hi> he has brought us
very near our Ruine. In the Ministry he
found, that <hi>France</hi> was governed by the
Spirit of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Madrid.</hi> Our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
received all the Impressions that Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
<hi>Marquemont</hi> gave them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Pope</hi> inspired all things to this <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal,</hi>
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> all things to the <hi>Pope.</hi>
The King jealous of the Grandeur of his
State, as much as a King can be, had an
Intention to follow the Interests of it.
The Stratagems of those that governed,
made him follow those of Strangers.
And if so be Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> had not
been Master of the Counsels, the Prince
naturally Foe to <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> had been
a good <hi>Spaniard,</hi> or good <hi>Italian,</hi> in
spite of his Aversion. I will alledge a
thing that's little known, but very true.
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:44396:171"/>
Cardinal <hi>Marquemont,</hi> writ a long Letter
to Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> concerning the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
of the <hi>Valtoline;</hi> and to render
himself necessary near this new Minister,
he instructed himself with Care in the
curious Measures one ought to observe,
when there was any Concern with the
<hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>Spaniards.</hi> For answer, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
<hi>Richelieu</hi> sent him four Lines, of
which behold the Sence.</p>
            <p>The King hath changed the Council, and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
their Maxim; there shall be an Army sent to the
<hi>Valtoline</hi> which shall make the <hi>Pope</hi> more compliant,
and give us Satisfaction of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Excellency of <hi>Marquemont</hi> was
much surprized at the Dryness of the
Letter, and yet more to see the new Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
that was going to reign in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry.
As he was an expert Man, he
changed the Model of his Conduct, and
begg'd Pardon of the Minister, if he had
been presumptuous enough to give him
Instructions, which himself ought to have
received. He confess'd his Error in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
believed, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> might
be reduced to a reasonable Treaty by a
single Negotiation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="326" facs="tcp:44396:172"/>
               <hi>Monsieur de Senectere</hi> often said, That this
small Letter of Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> to Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<hi>Marquemont,</hi> was the first thing, that
made the Design comprehended, of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
pulling down the Power of <hi>Spain,</hi>
and rendring to our Nation the Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority,
it had lost.</p>
            <p>But to undertake abroad, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to be assured at Home, and the
<hi>Huguenot</hi> Party was so considerable in
<hi>France,</hi> that it seem'd to compose another
State in the State. That did not hinder <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu</hi>
from reducing it. As they made War
unfortunately enough in the Ministry of
the Constable of <hi>Luynes,</hi> it was conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to make a new Model, and this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del
produced Effects as happy, as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had Successes little favourable.</p>
            <p>It is not questioned, but that <hi>Rochelle</hi>
was the Soul of the Party; 'twas there
were Deliberations made, Designs were
framed, the Interests of a Hundred
and a Hundred Cities came to unite;
and 'twas from thence, that a Body com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
of so many separate Parties, received
Heat and Motion, there was nothing else
to be done then, but to take <hi>Rochelle, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>helle</hi>
falling destroyed all the rest.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="327" facs="tcp:44396:172"/>But when the Strength of the Place
came to be considered, when they thought
on the Multitude of Defendants, the
Zeal of these People, and how much their
Soldiers were encouraged, when they
considered the Easiness of relieving it; they
saw the Sea at Liberty, and thereby the
Gates open to Strangers, then they belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
impregnable, that which had never
been taken. There was but a Cardinal
<hi>Richlieu,</hi> that did not despair of a Possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of taking it.</p>
            <p>He was in Hopes, and his Hopes made
him draw the Design of this great Siege.
In the Deliberation all Difficulties were
raised; in the Execution all subdued.</p>
            <p>One will eternally remember that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Bank, that great Work of Art that
did Violence to Nature, that gave new
Bounds to the Ocean. One will always
remember the Obstinacy of the besieged,
and the Resolution of the Aggressors.</p>
            <p>To what end should there be a longer
Discourse, <hi>Rochelle</hi> was taken, and it was
hardly surrendred, but there was a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Enterprize without. The Dukedom
of <hi>Mantua</hi> being come by succession to
to the Duke of <hi>Nevers, France</hi> had a
mind to establish it self therein, and
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:44396:173"/>
               <hi>Spain</hi> gathered an Army to prevent it.
The Emperour under pretence of his
Right, but indeed to serve <hi>Spain,</hi> trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
some Troops into <hi>Italy,</hi> and the
Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who was entred into the
Interests of the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> was to
stop us at the Passage of the Mountains,
to give the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Germans</hi> leisure
to execute their Designs.</p>
            <p>So many Oppositions were unfruitful,
the way of ... was forced, the Army
of the Emperour lost all. <hi>Spinola</hi> died
with Grief for not having taken <hi>Cassal,</hi>
and the Duke of <hi>Nevers</hi> acknowledged
Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> remained quiet pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessor
of his Dominion, whilst the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour's
Army destroyed it self in <hi>Italy.
Gustavus</hi> King of <hi>Sueden</hi> was in <hi>Germany,</hi>
where he won Battels, took Cities, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
his Conquests from the <hi>Baltick Sea</hi>
to the very <hi>Rhine.</hi> He became too power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for us, when he was kill'd; and his
Death left the <hi>Suedes</hi> too Feeble for our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests.
There was the Master-piece of
the Ministry of Cardinal <hi>Richlieu.</hi> He
retained Troops that were desirous of
passing into <hi>Suedeland.</hi> He fortified the
good Intentions of a Young Queen not
well established, and rested so well upon
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:44396:173"/>
               <hi>Bavaria,</hi> that the War was maintained
under a new Reign with as much vigour,
as it was under that Great King.</p>
            <p>When the Duke of <hi>Weymar,</hi> and the
<hi>Marshal Hornes</hi> had lost the Battel of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingue,</hi>
Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> redoubled his
Succours, dispatch'd great Armies into
<hi>Germany,</hi> stopt the Progress of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialists,
and gave the <hi>Suedes</hi> an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to re-establish their Affairs in the
Empire.</p>
            <p>Behold what Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> has
done, as Great, Magnanimous, Wise, and
Resolute. Let us see what he did by his
<hi>vast</hi> Soul.</p>
            <p>The Prison of the Elector of <hi>Trier</hi> gives
us an occasion, or pretence to declare
War against the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
was worthy of the g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eat Soul of
Cardinal <hi>Richlieu:</hi> but that <hi>vast</hi> Spirit,
which was imputed to him, was lost in
the extent of his Projects. He took such
false Measures abroad, and gave such ill
Orders at home, that our Affairs in all
likelihood must be ruined.</p>
            <p>The Cardinal had in his Thoughts the
most fantastical design that ever was; it
was to attack <hi>Flanders</hi> behind, and take
from it all the Communication it might
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:44396:174"/>
have with <hi>Germany</hi> by the way of the
<hi>Meuse.</hi> He imagined that he should take
<hi>Brussels,</hi> and reduce the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> at
the same time. For this effect, he sent an
Army of Thirty Five Thousand Men to
join that of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> in <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant.</hi>
But instead of inclosing <hi>Flanders</hi>
between the <hi>Meuse</hi> and the <hi>Sarne,</hi> he shut
up our Army between the Forts of
<hi>Flanders</hi> and the <hi>Meuse:</hi> insomuch that
there was neither Provision, nor Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
in our Camp; and without
amplifying the Matter, the Misery was so
great there, that after having raised the
Siege of <hi>Lauvain</hi> defended by some Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
only, the Officers and Soldiers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
into <hi>France,</hi> not in a Body, like
Troops, but dispersed, begging for their
Subsistence, like Pilgrims. See what the
<hi>vast</hi> Spirit of the Cardinal produced by
the fantastical Project of two Armies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined.
The second Campaign, this same
Spirit scattered into its Idea's, took yet
less measures. The Enemies forced the
Count ... who defended the Passage
of <hi>Be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> with an inconsiderable Body.</p>
            <p>Having passed the <hi>Somme,</hi> they made
themselves Masters of the Field, took
our Cities, which they found provided
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:44396:174"/>
with all Things, carried Desolation as
far as <hi>Compiegne,</hi> and Terror even to <hi>Paris.</hi>
A fine Commendation for Cardinal <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu</hi>
to have been <hi>vast</hi> in his Projects.
That very Quality, which the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of the Academy make so highly
valuable, made him commit no less
Faults in the Campaign of <hi>Aire.</hi> He
undertook a great Siege in <hi>Flanders</hi> at
the same time that the Count ...
entred into <hi>Champagne</hi> with an Army.
Hardly had we taken <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re,</hi> but the
<hi>Mareshal de la Meilleray</hi> was shock'd, and
the City besieged by the Enemy.</p>
            <p>If so be the Count ... had not been
killed after he had won the Battel of <hi>Sedan,</hi>
one might have expected the greatest dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
in the World, in the Disposition
People were in. If the Gentlemen of
the Academy had known particularly
<hi>Monsieur de Turenne,</hi> they would have
plainly seen that the <hi>vast</hi> Spirit of the
Cardinal had no Recommendation with
him. This Great General admired a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Qualities of this Great Minister, but
he could not bear with the <hi>vast,</hi> for which
he is commended. 'Twas this that caus'd
him to affirm, That Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi>
was Wiser than Cardinal <hi>Richlieu;</hi> that
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:44396:175"/>
the designs of Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi> were just
and regular, those of Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi>
greater and less concerted to come from an
Imagination, that had too great an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</p>
            <p>See, Gentlemen, a part of the Reasons
that I had to tell you against <hi>vast.</hi> If so
be I don't submit to the Judgment you have
given in favour of Madam <hi>Mazarin,</hi> 'tis
because I have found in your Writings a
Censure of <hi>vast</hi> of much greater force, than
what shall be read in this Discourse.</p>

            <p>YOU desire to know, whether I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
that Moral of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> which
is attributed to me. I could honour my
self therewith, but I don't love to give
my self a desert which I have not, and
I will tell you ingeniously, That it is
not mine. I have a great disadvantage in
those little Treatises, which are printed
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:44396:175"/>
under my Name. There are some that are
well done, which I don't acknowledge,
because they don't belong to me; and
amongst the Things which I have done,
there is mixed a great many Silly Things,
which I don't trouble my self to disclaim.
At the Age I am of, an Hour of Life well
managed is much more considerable to
me, than the Interest of a Moderate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.
How difficultly do People get
rid of Self-love, I leave it as an Author,
and retake it as a Philosopher, feeling a
secret Pleasure in neglecting what makes
the Application of others. The word
<hi>Pleasure</hi> makes me recall <hi>Epicurus,</hi> and
confess that of all the Opinions of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
concerning the Sovereign Good,
there is none that appears to me so reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
as his. It would be to no purpose
to alledge here the Reasons, that are a
hundred times given by the <hi>Epicureans,</hi>
that the love of Pleasure, and the avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Grief are the first and most natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Motions, that are observed in Men:
That Riches, Power, Honour, and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
may contribute to our Happiness: but
that the sole enjoyment of Pleasure, Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuousness,
to speak all, is the single
end to which our Actions relate. 'Tis a
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:44396:176"/>
thing clear enough of it self, and I am
fully perswaded thereof. In the mean
time, I don't well know what was the
Pleasure of <hi>Epicurus;</hi> for I never saw
Sentiments so different, as those Men
have entertained upon the Manners of
this Philosopher. Philosophers, and
even some of his own Scholars have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
against him, as a sensual and
careless Person, that never departed from
his Idleness but by a Debauch. All Sects
are opposed to his. Magistrates have
considered his Doctrine as prejudicial to
the Publick. <hi>Cicero</hi> so just, and so wise
in his Opinions, <hi>Plutarch</hi> so much esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for his Judgment, have not been favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to him. And for what relates to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
the Fathers have made him pass
for the greatest and most dangerous of
impious Persons. Behold his Enemies, and
behold now his Friends. <hi>Metrodorus, Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macus,
Meneceus,</hi> and many others that
argued with him, had as much Veneration,
as Friendship for his Person. <hi>Diogenes La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertius</hi>
could not write his Life more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageously
for his Reputation. <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretius</hi>
was his adorer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Seneca,</hi> as much
an Enemy as he was to his Sect, hath
spoken of him with Praise<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If so be some
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:44396:176"/>
Cities have an Aversion for him, others<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> have
erected Statues in his Honour.</p>
            <p>In the midst of all these Authorities
opposed one to the other, what Medium
is there to decide? Shall I say that <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus</hi>
is a Corrupter of good Manners,
upon the Credit of a jealous Philosopher,
or a discontented Disciple, that shall have
let himself go to a Resentment for some
Injury or other?</p>
            <p>Besides, <hi>Epicurus</hi> desiring to ruine the
Opinion, which was had of Providence,
and the Immortality of the Soul, cannot I
reasonably perswade my self, that the
World rose up against a scandalous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and that the Life of the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
was assaulted to discredit more easily
his Opinions? but if I am unwilling to
believe what his Enemies and his Rivals
have published of him, so do I not easily
believe, what his Partisans dare say. I
don't think, that he had a design to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce
a Pleasure more severe, than the
Vertue of the <hi>Stoicks.</hi> This jealousie of
austerity seems to me extravagant in a
voluptuous Philosopher, let his Pleasure be
interpreted as it will. A fine secret to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
against a vertue, that takes away
the Sence from a Wise Man, to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:44396:177"/>
a Pleasure that affords him no Motion.
The wise Man of the Stoicks is a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
insensible; that of the <hi>Epicureans</hi> a
voluptuous Immoveable. The first is in
Afflictions without Afflictions; the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
tastes a Pleasure without Pleasure.
What Reason had a Philosopher, that disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
the Immortality of Souls, to mortifie
the senses? Why put a Divorce between
two Parties composed of the same Matter,
who ought to have found their Advantage
in the Concord and Union of their Parties?
I pardon our religious Men the sad Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity
of eating nothing but Herbs, in
the Prospect they have of obtaining there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
an eternal Happiness: but that a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher,
who knows no other good things,
than those of this World, that the Doctor of
Pleasure should make a Commons of Bread
and Water to arrive at the sovereign
Happiness of Life, that's what my little
Understanding will not comprehend. I
admire, they don't establish the Pleasure
of such an <hi>Epicurus</hi> in Death; for to
consider the Misery of Life, his chiefest
Good should have been, to put an end
to it. Believe me, if <hi>Horace</hi> and <hi>Petro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
had imagined him to themselves,
as he is described, they would not have
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:44396:177"/>
taken him for their Master in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Pleasures. The Piety, which is
allowed him for the Gods, is no less ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous,
than the Mortification of his
Senses; those idle Gods, those disabled
Beings, from whom he saw nothing to be
hoped, or feared, did not merit the pains
of his Worship; and let not People say,
That he went to the Temple, for fear of
drawing the Magistrates upon him, and
scandalizing his Citizens; for he had much
less scandalized them, by not assisting at
the Sacrifice, than he doth offend them by
his Writings, which destroyed the Gods
in the World, or at least ruined the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
they had in their Protection. But
what's your Opinion of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> says
one to me? You believe neither his
Friends, nor his Enemies, his Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
nor his Partisans. What is your
Judgment of him? I'm of Opinion,
That <hi>Epicurus</hi> was a very wise Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,
who, according to the time and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions,
loved Pleasure in Repose, or
Pleasure in Motion; and from this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Pleasure, is come that of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
he has had. <hi>Timisecrates</hi> and
his Enemies have set upon him by sensual
Pleasures: those that have defended him,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:44396:178"/>
have spoken of nothing, but of a Spiritual
Pleasure. When the first have accused
him of the expence he made in his
Banquets, I am perswaded that the Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
was well grounded. When the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
have made him swallow down those
little Morsels of Cheese to make better
chear than was usual, I believe they did
not want Reason. When one says that he
argued with <hi>Leontium,</hi> one says true.
When one affirms that he diverted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with her, one doth not tell me, there
is a time to laugh, and a time to weep, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>Solomon;</hi> a time to be sober,
and a time to be sensual according to <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus.</hi>
Besides a voluptuous Man is not
equally so all his Life. In Religion, the
greatest Libertine is sometimes the most
Devout. In the study of wisdom, the
most indulgent to Pleasure, is sometimes the
most severe. As for me, I look other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
upon <hi>Epicurus</hi> in Youth and Health,
than in Old Age and Distempers. Insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibleness,
Tranquillity, and the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of idle sick Persons could not be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
express'd, than they are in his Writings.
Sensual Pleasure is not less explained in
that Formal Passage, which <hi>Cicero</hi> expresly
alledges. I know, that nothing is forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:44396:178"/>
to destroy him, or to shift him off:
but may Conjectures be compared with
the Testimony of <hi>Cicero,</hi> who knew so well
the Philosophers of <hi>Greece,</hi> and their Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy?
It were much better to reject
him upon the Inconstancy of Humane
Nature, and upon the Inequality of our
Minds. Where is a Man so uniform,
as to have nothing of inequality, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety
in his Actions? <hi>Solomon</hi> deserves
the name of Wise, at least as much as
<hi>Epicurus,</hi> and he did equally mistake in his
Opinions, and in his Conduct. <hi>Montagne,</hi>
as yet very Young, believed that his
Thoughts should be eternally fixed upon
Death, to be prepared for it: when he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
Old Age, he makes, says he, a
Recantation, desiring to be sweetly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
by Nature, that will sufficiently
learn us to die.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Bernier,</hi> a great favourer of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus,</hi>
doth now confess, that after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
studied Philosophy Fifty Years, he
doubts of things that he had believed
the most assured. All Objects have different
Faces, and the Minds, which are in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
Motion look upon them, as they
turn: insomuch that we have nothing,
that I may so speak, but new Aspects,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:44396:179"/>
thinking to enjoy new Discoveries. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
Age brings great Alterations in our
Humour, and by the Alteration of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
is very often framed that of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.
Add, that the Pleasures of the
Senses sometimes render despicable the
Satisfactions of the Mind, as too dry, and
too naked; and that the nice and refined
Satisfactions of the Mind, despise in their
turn the Pleasures of the Senses, as gross.
So one ought not to be surprized, that,
in so great a diversity of Prospects, and
Motions, <hi>Epicurus</hi> who hath writ more
than any Philosopher, should say the same
thing in a different Manner, according
as he might have different Thoughts and
Notions of it. What Occasion is there
for those general Arguments to shew that
he could be sensible of all sorts of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures?
If you consider him in his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity
with Women, you will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that he spent so much time with
<hi>Leontium</hi> and <hi>Ternissa</hi> to do nothing but
read Philosophy. But if he loved the
Enjoyment of them as a voluptuous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
he managed himself as a prudent Man;
and being indulgent to the Motions of
Nature, contrary to Efforts, not always
reckoning Chastity for a Vertue, always
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:44396:179"/>
accounting Luxury a Vice, he would have
Sobriety to be a Dispensation of the
Appetite, and that the Feasts which
were made, should never hurt those that
were to be. <hi>Sic praesentibus voluptatibus
fruaris, ut futuris non noceas.</hi> He disen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
Pleasures from the Disorders that
precede them, and the Distaste that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
them. As he fell into Infirmities
and Pains, he fixed the chiefest Good in
Insensibleness: Wisely, in my Opinion,
for the Condition he was in; for the Ces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
of Pain, is the Happiness of those
that endure it. As for the Tranquillity
of the Mind, which composed the other
part of his Happiness; 'tis nothing
but an Exemption from Trouble: But
he that can have no more agreeable
Motions, is happy in curing himself from
the grievous Impressions of Pain.</p>
            <p>After all this Discourse, I conclude, that
Insensibleness and Repose should make
the chiefest Good of <hi>Epicurus</hi> infirm and
languishing: but for a Man that's
in Health, for a Man that's in a
Condition to taste of Pleasures, I'm of
Opinion that Health makes it self dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
by something more lively than
a Want of Sense, and that a good Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:44396:180"/>
of the Soul would have something
more enlivening than a peaceable State.</p>
            <p>We live in the midst of an Infinity of
Goods and Evils, and with Senses capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of being affected with the one, and
prejudiced with the other: Without so
much Philosophy, a little Reason will
make us taste good things as sweetly as
'tis possible, and adapt us for Misfortunes
as patiently as we can.</p>

            <head>REFLECTIONS
UPON
RELIGION.</head>
            <p>TO consider purely the Repose of this
Life; it would be well if Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
had more or less Influence upon
Mankind. It compells, and doth not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
enough; like some Politicks, that
take away the Sweetness of Liberty, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
bringing the Advantages of Subjection.</p>
            <p>The Will makes us aspire gently to
those good things, which are promised
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:44396:180"/>
to us, because it is not excited enough
by an Understanding, that is not enough
convinced.</p>
            <p>We say by Compliance, that we believe
what one says with Authority, we ought
to believe: But without a particular Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
we are more disturbed, than perswaded
of a thing, that doth not fall under the
Evidence of the Senses, and which affords
no manner of Demonstration to our
Minds.</p>
            <p>Behold what is the effect of Religion,
in respect of ordinary Men; now see the
advantages of it for the true and perfect
Religious Man.</p>
            <p>The true Devout Person breaks with
Nature, if one may so speak, to take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in the abstinence of pleasures; and
in the Subjection of the Body to the
Mind, he renders to himself in some
measure delightful the use of Mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Pains.</p>
            <p>Philosophy goes no further, than to
teach us to endure Misfortunes. The Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion makes us triumph over
them, and one may say seriously of it,
what has been gallantly express'd of Love.</p>
            <p>All other Pleasures are not worth its Pains.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="344" facs="tcp:44396:181"/>The true Christian knows how to make
his advantages of all things; the evils
which he suffers, are the good Things
which God sends to him. The good
Things which he wants, are evils which
Providence has secured him from. Every
thing's a benefit to him, every thing in this
World is a Mercy, and when he must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,
by the necessity of his Mortal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
he looks upon the end of his Life,
as a Passage to one more happy, which is
never to conclude.</p>
            <p>Such is the Felicity of a true Christian,
whilst uncertainty and trouble make an
unhappy Condition to all others.</p>
            <p>Indeed, we are almost all unresolved,
little determined to good and evil.</p>
            <p>There is a continual turn and return
from Nature to Religion, and from Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
to Nature.</p>
            <p>If so be we abandon the care of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to satisfie our Inclinations, these very
Inclinations rise immediately against their
Pleasures, and the distaste of Objects,
which have flattered them the most, sends
us back to the cares of our happiness.</p>
            <p>If so be we renounce our Pleasures by
a Principle of Conscience, the same thing
happens to us in the Application to happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:44396:181"/>
where habit and tediousness sends us
back to the Objects of our first Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>Behold, how we are upon Religion in
our selves: now see the Judgment which
the Publick makes of it.</p>
            <p>Should we forsake God for the World,
we are treated as Impious Persons.</p>
            <p>Should we forsake the World for God,
we are look'd upon as weak, and decayed
in our Understanding, and we are as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
pardoned for Sacrificing Fortune to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
as Religion to Fortune.</p>
            <p>The Example of Cardinal <hi>Retz</hi> will suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
singly, to justifie what I say.</p>
            <p>When he was made Cardinal by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues,
Factions, and Tumults, they cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out against an Ambitious Man, that
sacrificed (said they) the Publick, his
Conscience, and Religion to his Fortune.
When he left the cares of Earth for those
of Heaven, when the Perswasion of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Life made him regard the Grandeurs
of this as Chimaera's, they said that his
Head was turned, and that he made a
scandalous weakness of what is proposed
to us in Christianity, as the greatest
Vertue.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="346" facs="tcp:44396:182"/>An ordinary Mind is but little favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to great Vertues, a lofty Wisdom of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends
a common Reason.</p>
            <p>Mine, as common as it is, admires a
Person truly perswaded, and would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
still more that this Person, absolutely
perswaded, could be insensible to any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of Fortune.</p>
            <p>I question a little the Perswasion of those
Preachers, who offering us the Kingdom
of Heaven in Publick, sollicit in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
a small Benefice with the utmost im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity.</p>
            <p>The sole Idea of eternal profits renders
the Possession of all the rest contemptible
to a believing Man: but because there is
but a few that have Faith, few Persons
defend this Idea against Objects; the hope
of what is promised to us, naturally yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the enjoyment of what's given us.</p>
            <p>In the greatest part of Christians, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of believing holds the place of belief:
the will gives them a sort of Faith by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
which the Understanding refuses
them by its Lights.</p>
            <p>I have known some Devout Men, that
in a certain contrariety between the Heart
and the Mind, loved God perfectly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a strong Faith in him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="347" facs="tcp:44396:182"/>When they abandoned themselves to the
Motions of their Heart, there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but zeal for Religion; all was fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency,
all love. When they turned to the
Intelligence of the Mind, they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed
at their incomprehension of what
they loved, and at their Ignorance how to
answer themselves upon the Subject of
their love. Then they wanted Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
to speak in Spiritual Terms, and
they fell into that sad State of Religious
Life, which is called Aridity and Dryness
in Monasteries.</p>
            <p>God alone is able to give us a certain,
firm, and real Faith. That which we
can do of our selves, is to captivate the
Understanding in spite of the resistance of
the Lights of Nature, and to dispose our
selves with submission to execute what is
ordained for us.</p>
            <p>Humanity easily mingles its errors in
what relates to Faith; it mistakes a little
in the practice of Vertues; for it is less in
our power to think exactly upon the
things of Heaven, than to do well.</p>
            <p>One can never be disappointed in the
Actions of Justice and Charity.</p>
            <p>Sometimes Heaven ordains, and Nature
makes an Opposition.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="348" facs="tcp:44396:183"/>Sometimes Nature demands what Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
won't consent to. Upon Justice and
Charity all Rights are concerted, and there
is, as it were, a general agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Heaven, Nature, and Reason.</p>

            <p>The Wise Man, above their weakness,

he sees others in slavery, tormented by
some unfortunate Passion, he tastes a sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

from the sense of Misfortunes, which are
not to be made insensible by Reason alone.</p>
            <p>Not but that he may fall into an error.
Humane Nature leaves no certain state to
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:44396:183"/>
our Souls: but it is not long before he

the Repose he had lost.</p>
            <p>Scarce do we begin to grow Old, but
we begin to be displeased by some distast,
which we secretly frame in our selves.
Then our Soul, free from Self-love, is easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

and what would have pleased us hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

and enslaves us to our own weakness.</p>
            <p>By this Mistresses dispose of their Old

Old Husbands: by this <hi>Syphax</hi> abandoned
himself to the will of <hi>Sophonisba,</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus</hi>

to draw all my Examples from Antiquity,
'twas thus <hi>Monsieur de la Ferte-Senectere,</hi>
worthy to be named with Kings and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
by the single merit of Gentleman;
'twas thus this Courtier, as wise as he was
polite, let himself go to the Friendship of
a Woman, whom he married in his Old
Days. If you should know, said he to his
Friends, what is the Condition of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

would not admire that I have sought for a

of what value it will. I never dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
him. And why discommend
a thing that ... hath authorized by
his Example? In the mean time, in spite
of his Authority, I shall esteem a Person
that hath strength enough to preserve the
taste of his Liberty to the end of his Days.
Not that a full independance of Persons so
free and so disengaged, of all those indifferent
and those ungrateful Men, is always com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable.
Let us avoid Subjection in an

            <p>Violent Passions are unequal, and make

            <p>Let us observe with Attention the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of those Obligations which are sold
so dear, and we shall find them compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of a hideous Melancholy, that makes
up all Man-haters.</p>
            <p>Indeed, to dispose ones self to love but
one person, and to hate all the rest, is what
is taken for Vertue in particular: In the
mean time 'tis a Vice against all the world.</p>
            <p>He that makes us lose the Acquaintance
of Men by a Desertion like his own,
makes us lose more than he is worth, had
he a considerable Merit. Let us act the
disinteressed as long as we please, and shut
up all our desires in the Monuments of our
Passions, thinking of nothing that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
not from thence, yet we shall grow
faint in this Noble Friendship, if so be
we don't draw from Society a part of
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:44396:185"/>
the Conveniencies and Agreements of
Life. The love of Two Persons made
fast one to another, this fine Union hath
need of Foreign things to excite the Taste
of Pleasure, and the sense of Joy; with all
the Sympathy of the World, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
and Intelligence, it will be troubled
to furnish some Consolation from the Tire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somness,
it is the Occasion of. 'Tis in the
World, and amongst Divertisements, and
Business, that the most agreeable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
are formed. I esteem the Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence
of <hi>Monsieur d' Estrees,</hi> and <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
de Senectere,</hi> that lived Fifty Years at
Court in an equal Familiarity: I esteem
the Confidence that <hi>Monsieur de Turenne</hi>
had with <hi>Monsieur de Ruvigni</hi> Forty Years
together, more than the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e Friendships al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
extravagant, and never rightly used
between Women and Men.</p>
            <p>There is nothing that contributes more
to the sweetness of Life, than Friendship.
There is nothing that disturbs its Repose
so much as Friends, if we have not Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
enough to chuse them well.</p>
            <p>Importunate Friends desire to be thought
indifferent; the scrupulous give us more
trouble by their Humour, than they bring
advantage by their Services. The imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:44396:185"/>
ones are Tyrants to us: We must hate
what they do, be it never so agreeable:
We must love, what they love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when we
find it rigorous and unpleasant: we must
do Violence to our Nature, enslave our
Judgment, renounce our Parts, and under
that sweet Name of Complaisance have a
general submission for all that they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
            <p>Jealous Friends disturb us; averse from
all Counsel they don't give, troubled at
the good, which happens to us without
their Participation, and glad of the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes,
which come by the Ministry of
others. There are Friends of Profession,
that take a pride in following our Party
at random, and upon all Occasions. These
sort of Friends serve for nothing else, but
to incense the World against us by impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Contests. There are others, that
justifie us when no Body accuses us; who
by Indiscretion make us commit Offences
in Places where we were not, and bring us
into what we would avoid. Let him, that
will, be contented with these Friendships;
as for me I am not satisfied with a single
good Will, I would have it accompanied
with Discretion and Prudence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="354" facs="tcp:44396:186"/>The Affection of a Man doth not make

               </gap> Motions of the Heart, Friends are more
proper to incense us, and more capable of
injuring than serving us. Notwithstanding
one speaks of nothing but the Heart, in
all the Discourses, which they are heard to
make upon Love and Friendship. Poets
become troublesome therein, Lovers tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and Friends ridiculous. One sees no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lse in our Plays but Kings Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
that yield the Heart, but refuse the
Hand; or Princesses, that give the Hand,
and cannot agree to yield the Heart. Lovers
become insipid in asking eternally the
Purity of this Heart, and Friends raised
to esteem would have it, as well as the
Lovers. It is not in knowing the Nature,
where for a little Heat ill managed, for
some unequal and uncertain Tenderness it
might have, one observes otherwise no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Fancy, Ingratitude, Infidelity,
which one ought to fear.</p>
            <p>Love is called blind very improperly,
not to displease the Genius of Poets, and the
Humours of Painters. Love is for the
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:44396:186"/>
most part a Passion, of which the Heart
often makes an ill Use.</p>
            <p>The Heart is a blind thing, to which
are owing all our Errours; 'tis that which
preferrs a Fool before an ingenious Man,
that loves silly Objects, and disdains ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Persons; that yields to the most ugly,
and most deformed, and refuses the most
handsom, and most genteel.</p>
            <p>'Tis that, which confounds the most
regular, that lifts up the most wise to Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and disposeth Saints to Grace; as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
subjected to Government in Monasteries,
as disposed to love in Families; unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to Husbands, less secure to Lovers; it
troubles the first, and puts a Disorder a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the rest.</p>
            <p>It acts without advice, and without
Knowledge. Weak against Reason that
should conduct it, it moves secretly by hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Springs, which it doth not discover; it
gives, and withdraws its Affections with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Occasion, it engages without design,
breaks without measure, and in a word,
produceth Fantastical Noises, which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
those that make them.</p>
            <p>Behold the end of Love and Friendships.</p>
            <p>Upon the Heart, by Reasons just and
reasonable, whose Division the Mind can
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:44396:187"/>
take, there is no Rupture to be apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
for either it remains the whole Life,
or it is insensibly disengaged with Discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Diligence. It is certain that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hath put in our Hearts something of
Laughter, if one may say so, some secret
Principle of Affection, that conceals what's
tender, that explains it self, and is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable
with Friends. But the use of
it has not been received and authorized a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
Men, but only as much as to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Life more peaceable and more happy.</p>
            <p>That's the Foundation, that <hi>Epicurus</hi> so
much recommended to his Disciples.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Cicero</hi> exhorts us to it, and invites
us by his own Example; that <hi>Seneca,</hi> as
wrinkled and severe as he is, becomes
sweet and tender, so soon as he speaks of
Friendship.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Montagne</hi> excells <hi>Seneca</hi> by more
lively Expressions.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Gassendus</hi> explains the Advantages
of this Vertue, and disposes the Reader, as
much as lies in his power, to procure them.</p>
            <p>All reasonable Persons, all honest Men
unite Philosophers therein, upon the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
that Friendship ought to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
more, than any other thing, to our
Happiness.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="357" facs="tcp:44396:187"/>Indeed, a Man would not break with
himself upon no Account whatsoever, to
unite himself to another, if so be he did
not find more Sweetness in this Union,
than in the first Sentiments of Self-love.</p>
            <p>The Friendship of wise Men finds no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in the World more precious than it
self.</p>
            <p>That of others, imperious, and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
disturbs the Peace of publick Society,
and the Pleasures of particular Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>'Tis a savage Friendship, which Reason
disowns and which we could wish to our
Enemies, to be revenged of their Hatred.</p>
            <p>But as honest, and as regular as Friends
may be, 'tis an inconvenient thing to have
too many: Our separated Cares don't
leave Application enough for those that
affect us, nor also for what relates to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in the overflowing of a Soul, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperses
it self upon all remote Actions, and
applys it self properly to nothing, nor we
our selves for few Persons living. As for
us, let us seek the Advantage of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce

            <p>THere is no Person that has more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
than I have for the Works
of the Ancients. I admire the Design,
the Oeconomy, the Elevation of Spirit, the
Extent of Knowledge: but the change of
Religion, Government, Customs, and
Manners, has made so great a one in the
World, that we must have, as it were, a
New Art, to enter well into the Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and Genius of the Age, we are in.
And certainly my Opinion ought to be
found reasonable by all those that will take
the pains to examine it; for if one gives
Characters quite opposite to. ...</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="359" facs="tcp:44396:188"/>Without the Prayer of <hi>Thetis</hi> to <hi>Iupiter,</hi>
and the Dream which <hi>Iupiter</hi> sent to <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memnon,</hi>
there would be no <hi>Iliad;</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

were no less necessary to execute them,
than to take them.</p>
            <p>The Immortal Captains of the Party of

Man was a pure Machine, whom secret

<pb n="360" facs="tcp:44396:189"/>

            <p>
               <hi>Lucretius</hi> asks it himself, and in the

            <p>In the mean time, we must not intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
this Formidable Majesty in all things,
whose name it is not permitted to make

               </gap> of

            <p>As for Christians, they should give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Truth, to him who is Truth in
Perfection, and they should adapt all
their Discourses to his Wisdom, and to his
Goodness.</p>
            <p>This great Principle is followed by that
of Manners, which by rea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>on of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
civilized, and sweetned at present,
can't suffer what they had of wildness in
those times.</p>
            <p>'Tis this change, that makes us find so
strange, the fierce and brutish injuries,
which <hi>Achilles</hi> and <hi>Agamemnon</hi> boast of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="361" facs="tcp:44396:189"/>'Tis by this <hi>Agamemnon</hi> appears odious
to us, when he takes away that <hi>Trojan</hi>'s
Life, which <hi>Menelaus</hi> had pardoned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Menelaus,</hi> for whom the War was made,
pardons him generously. <hi>Agamemnon</hi> the
King of Kings, who owed Examples of
Vertue to all the Princes, and to all the
People, the cowardly <hi>Agamemnon</hi> kills this
miserable Person with his own Hand. 'Tis
then <hi>Achilles</hi> becomes horrible, when he
kills the young <hi>Lycaon,</hi> who entreated him
so tenderly for his Life.</p>
            <p>'Tis then we hate him even to his Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
when he ties the Body of <hi>Hector</hi>
to his Chariot, and drags him inhumane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the Camp of the <hi>Greeks.</hi> I had a
kindness for him, when he was the Friend
of <hi>Patroclus.</hi> The cruelty of his Action
makes me abhor his Valour, and his
Friendship.</p>
            <p>'Tis quite otherwise in <hi>Hector.</hi> His
good Qualities return into our Minds; we
pity him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we lament him more; his Idea
is become very dear, and draws all the
Sentiments of our Affection.</p>
            <p>Let it not be said in favour of <hi>Achilles,</hi>
that <hi>Hector</hi> kill'd his dear <hi>Patroclus.</hi> The
resentment of this Death doth not excuse
him with us. An affliction that permits
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:44396:190"/>
him to suspend his Revenge, and to tarry
for his Arms, before he goes to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat;
an Affliction so patient ought not to
have push'd him to this unusual Barbarity,
after the Fight's over.</p>
            <p>But let us disengage our Friendship from
our Aversion; the sweetest, the tenderest
of Vertues doth not bring forth effects so
contrary to Nature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> found them in the bottom of
his Nature. It is not to the Friend of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troclus,</hi>
but to the Inhumane and Inexora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>Achilles,</hi> that they belong.</p>
            <p>All the World will easily consent to it.
However, the Vices of the Hero will not
fall upon the Poet. <hi>Homer</hi>'s Intention
was more to describe the Nature, such as
he saw it, than to make Heroes very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished.</p>
            <p>He has described them with more Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
than Vertues; Passions being in the
Foundation of Nature, and Vertues pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
established in us by the Lights of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
Reason.</p>
            <p>Policy had not as yet united Men by the
Knots of a reasonable Society; it had not
turned them well to others. Morality had
not yet formed them well for themselves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="363" facs="tcp:44396:190"/>Good Qualities were not distinguished
enough from the Bad.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vlisses</hi> was prudent, and fearful, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
against dangers, industrious to get
out of them, valiant sometimes when
there was less danger to be so, than not
to be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> was valiant, and fierce, and
what <hi>Horace</hi> would not set down in his
Character of him, relaxing sometimes to
very great Puerilities, his Nature uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
and irregular framed Manners, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
fierce, sometimes childish. Now he
drags the Body of <hi>Hector</hi> in a Barbarian
manner, now he prays the Goddess
his Mother, as a Child, to drive away the
Flies from that of <hi>Patroclus</hi> his dear
Friend.</p>
            <p>The ways are not less different, than the
manners. Two Hero's ready for the
Combat would not amuse themselves now
a days in declaring their Genealogy: but
it is easie to observe in the <hi>Iliads,</hi> and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in the <hi>Odysseus,</hi> and the <hi>Aeneids,</hi> that
such a Method was practised. Men dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed,
before they fought, just as they
make Speeches in <hi>England,</hi> before they
die.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="364" facs="tcp:44396:191"/>As for Comparisons, Discretion shall
make us do less than they. Good
sence will render them more just, Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
more new.</p>
            <p>The Sun, the Moon, the Elements, will
lend us no more an easie stateliness. Wolves,
Shepherds, and Flocks, will not afford us
a simplicity too much known.</p>
            <p>It seems to me, that there is an infinite
number of Comparisons, that are more
alike, than the things compared. A
Kite that grounds upon a Pidgeon, a Spar-Hawk
that sets upon little Birds, a Faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon
that makes his descent; all these
Birds have more Relation one to another in
the swiftness of their flight, than the
Men have, whom they compare to them,
in their impetuosity. Take away the
Distinction of the names of Kite, Spar-hawk,
and Faulkon, you'll find but the
same Thing.</p>
            <p>The violence of a Whirl-wind, that
roots up Trees, more resembles that of a
Tempest, which makes some other dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order,
than Objects with which they are
compared.</p>
            <p>A Lion, whom Hunger drives from his
Den, a Lioness pursued by Hunters, a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
furious and jealous of his Whelps, a
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:44396:191"/>
Lion against whom a Village assembles,
and who ceases not to retire fiercely with
Pride: this is a Lion differently repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented,
but still a Lion which doth not
afford Idea's different enough. Sometimes
Comparisons take us from Subjects that
employ us most, by the vain Image of
another Object, that makes an unseasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Diversion.</p>
            <p>I oblige my self to consider two Armies,
that are ready for the engagement, and I
take the Spirit of a Man of Courage to
observe the Behaviour, Order, and Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of the Troops. Of a sudden, I am
transported to the Banks of a Sea, which
becomes swell'd by the Fury of the
Winds, and I am more likely to behold
Ship-wrack'd Vessels, than broken Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talions.
These vast Thoughts, which
the Sea affords me, extinguish the
former.</p>
            <p>One represents to me a Mountain all on
Fire, and a Forest absolutely inflamed.
Whither doth not the Idea of a Conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
extend? If so be I were not full
Master of my sence, one might insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
conduct me to the Imagination of the
World's end.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="366" facs="tcp:44396:192"/>From so terrible a Conflagration, I pass
to a hideous Lightning, and with much
Diversion, I am so much interrupted from
the first Image that imployed me, that
I lose entirely that of the Battle.</p>
            <p>We think to embellish Objects in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
them to eternal, immense, infinite
beings, and we stifle them, instead of
extolling them.</p>
            <p>To say, that a Woman is as hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
as Madam <hi>Mazarin;</hi> is to praise
her more, than if she were compared to
the Sun; for the sublime and miraculous,
make esteemed.</p>
            <p>The impossible and the fabulous destroy
the Commendation, which one would
give.</p>
            <p>Truth was not the Inclination of the first
Ages; an unprofitable Lye, a lucky Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ood
made the Interest of Impostors, and
the Pleasure of credulous Persons; 'twas
the Secret of the great and the wise to
govern the People, and the simple
Men.</p>
            <p>The Vulgar, who respected mysterious
Errours, despised naked Truths, and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
consisted in the abusing of it.</p>
            <p>Discourse was fitted to so advantageous
a Use; there was nothing in it but Ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:44396:192"/>
Allegories, and Similitudes; nothing
appeared as it is in it self, Specious and Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical
out-sides covered the inward part of
all things; vain Idea's, concealed Realities,
and too frequent Comparisons turn'd men
from the Application to true Objects, by
the Amusement of Resemblances.</p>
            <p>The Genius of our Age is quite opposite
to this Spirit of Fable, and false Mysteries.</p>
            <p>We love open Truths, good Sence takes
an advantage over the Illusions of Fancy,
and nothing satisfies us now-a-days, but the
Solidity of Reason.</p>
            <p>Add to this Alteration of Humour, that
of Knowledge: we look otherwise upon
Nature, than the Ancients did.</p>
            <p>The Heavens, that eternal Mansion of
so many Divinities, are no more, than an
immense, and fluid Space.</p>
            <p>The same Sun shines still upon us, but
we give it another Course, and instead of
going to set in the Sea, it goes to enlighten
another World.</p>
            <p>The Earth immoveable heretofore in
the Opinion of Men, turns now, and is
not to be equall'd in the Swiftness of its
Motion. Every thing is changed, Gods,
Nature, Politicks, Manners, Humours,
and Ways. Will not so many Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:44396:193"/>
produce some change in our
Works?</p>
            <p>If <hi>Homer</hi> was living at present, he
would make admirable Poems, fitted to the
Age, wherein he should write. Our Poets,
make bad ones, framed to that of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients,
and guided by things, which time
hath altered.</p>
            <p>I know that there are certain eternal
Rules to be grounded upon a good Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
upon a firm and solid Reason, that
shall always subsist. Yet there are but
few, that bear the Character of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible
Reason. Those that relate
to the Manners, Affairs, and Customs of
the Ancient <hi>Greeks</hi> have no effect upon us
at present. One may say of them what
<hi>Horace</hi> said of Words; they have their
Age and their Duration, they die of old
Age. <hi>Ita verborum interit aetas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Others perish with their Nation, as well
as the Maxims of Government, which
subsist not after t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e Empire.</p>
            <p>There are then but very few, that can
direct our Minds in all Times, and it
would be Ridiculous always to Rule new<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Works by extinguished Laws. Poetry
would be to blame to exact from us,
what Religion and Justice do not.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="369" facs="tcp:44396:193"/>'Tis to an Imitation, servile, or too much
affected, that is owing the disgrace of all
our Poems.</p>
            <p>Our Poets have not force to escape
the Gods, nor address to employ well
what our Religion could furnish them
with.</p>
            <p>Tied to the Humour of Antiquity and
confined to our Sentiments, they give the
Air of <hi>Mercury</hi> to our Angels, and that of
the Fabulous wonders of the Ancients to
our Miracles.</p>
            <p>This mixture of Ancient and Modern
has made them succeed very ill. And
one may say, That they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> not known
how to draw any advantage from their
Fictions, nor make a good use of our
Truths.</p>
            <p>We conclude that the Poems of <hi>Homer</hi>
will always be a Master-piece, and not
a Model in all things. They will form
our Judgment, if so be we determine
them with Discretion, and pursuant to
the Disposition of present Affairs.</p>

            <p>IN all the handsome Persons I have seen, if so
be there were some Passages to be admired,
there were also some, that one ought not to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
or at least disguise them with much arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice;
for, to speak the truth, it's hard to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
all, and be sincere. I am obliged to <hi>Aemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi>
for leaving me purely in my Nature, as much
disposed to speak well, as to remain exactly
true. As she wants neither favour nor kindness,
I have no busin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> either with Disguises or Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries.
By her means I can praise to day with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Complaisance. Observators too exact loose a
Malicious Nicety, which is applied but to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
Faults; and in a new Spirit which she

               </gap>s them with, they pass with pleasure
from their usual Censure, to real Approbations.</p>
            <p>It is certain that the greatest part of Women
are more indebted to our Complements, than
their own Merits, in all the Praises which are
given to the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>Aemilia</hi> is obliged only to her

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>stice which is rendred to her, and
secure of the good one ought to affirm of her,
she has properly no Interest, but for that which
may be procured from her.</p>
            <p>In effect, if her Enemies speak of her, it is not
in their power to betray their Conscience, and
they confess with as much truth as anger, the
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:44396:194"/>
advantages which they are obliged to acknowledge
in her: if so be her Friends enlarge themselves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her Commendations, it is not possible for them
to add any thing to the Merit which affects them.
Thus the former are forced to submit to Reason,
when they would follow the Malice of their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
and the others meerly just with all their
Friendship, without a Capacity of being either
officious, or favourable. She expects then nothing
from the Inclination, as she apprehends nothing
from an evil Will, in the Judgments that are made
of her. But since one is free to conceal his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<hi>Aemilia</hi> will have Reason to fear the Malice
of Silence, the single prejudice that Rivals and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
can offer to her.</p>
            <p>It's necessary to leave things somewhat general,
to come to a more particular Description of her
Person.</p>
            <p>All her Features are regular, which is very sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
observed. All her Features are regular and
agreeable, which is as it were never seen; for it
seems that a Fancy of Nature may produce the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greements
of Regularity, and that compleat Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
who have always something to be admired,
rarely enjoy the Secret of Pleasing. <hi>Aemilia</hi> hath
affecting Eyes, the Complexion parted, delicate,
smooth; the Whiteness of Teeth, the Vermilion
of Lips are Expressions too general for a secret and
particular Charm, which I cannot describe. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
her, that Shape, that lower Part of the Face,
where was placed the great Beauty of the Ancients,
would be found no where but in the <hi>Idea</hi> of some
Painter, or in the Descriptions which Antiquity
has left us; and to enliven so many fine things, you
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:44396:195"/>
see upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Face a lively Clearness, an Air of
Health, a fullness in a good Degree, that leaves
nothing more to be apprehended.</p>
            <p>Her Stature of an exact Height, well propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd,
easie, of a Freedom as far from Constraint,
as that excessive Beauty, wherein appears as it were
a sort of Loosness, which ruines the good Grace,
and the good Carriage. Add to this a noble Gate,
a serious Behaviour, but natural, which is neither
starch'd, nor confus'd; the Laugh, the Speech, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
accompanied with Agreements and Decorum's.</p>
            <p>Her Spirit is extensive without being <hi>Vast,</hi> never
rambling so far in general Thoughts, as not to be
able to return easily to singular Considerations;
nothing escapes her Penetration, her Judgment
leaves nothing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nknown: And I cannot tell, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
she is more fit to unravel hidden things, than to
judge soundly of those, which appear secret to us and
not Mysterious; knowing equally how to be oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunely
silent, and speaking. In her ordinary Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
she says nothing with study, and nothing at
a venture, the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>st Matters mark Attention, there
appears no endeavour in the most serious; what
she has of Life ceases not to be exact, and her most
natural Thoughts are express'd with a delicate
Turn: But she hates lucky Imaginations, that escape
from the Mind without Choice and without Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that are as it were always admired, and for the
most part little esteemed by those, that have them.</p>
            <p>In all her Person you see something of Great and
Noble, which is found by a secret Relation in the
Air of the Face, the Qualities of the Mind, and
those of the Soul.</p>
            <p>Naturally she would be too Magnificent, but a
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:44396:195"/>
just Consideration of her Affairs retains this noble
Sentiment, and she chuseth rather to constrain the
Generosity of her Humour, than to fall into a
Condition, where she should stand in need of that
of another, as fierce to refuse any Favour from her
own, as officious with Strangers, and full of Heat
in the Interests of her Friends. Not that these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations
make her lose an Inclination so noble, she
regulates it in the use of her Estate; her Nature, and
her Reason form an Unconcernedness without Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence.</p>
            <p>She has good Sense and Dexterity in Affairs she
enters in voluntarily, if so be she finds therein a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial
Advantage for her self, or for her Friends:
But she hates to act by a Spirit of Restlessness;
equally against an unuseful Motion, and the Soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of a Repose, that takes a Pride in the Name
of Tranquillity, to cover a true Indifference.</p>
            <p>After having described so many Qualities so fine,
it's proper to see what Impressions they make upon
our Soul, and what's doing in her own.</p>
            <p>She has something of Majestical, that imprints
Respect; something of sweet and ingenious, that
wins the Inclinations. She attracts you, she retains
you, and you always approach to her with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
that you cannot shew.</p>
            <p>To pierce into the inward Part, I don't believe
her to be uncapable of the Sentiments she gives:
But imperious upon her self, as well as upon you,
she masters in her own Heart by Reason, what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
constrains in yours.</p>
            <p>Nature being infirm in some Souls, doth not leave
there force to desire any thing; impetuous in others,
it brings forth transported Passions: exact in <hi>Aemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi>
               <pb n="374" facs="tcp:44396:196"/>
it has made the Heart sensible, which ought
to feel, and has given to Reason, which ought to
command, an absolute Empire over her Motions.</p>
            <p>Happy she, that lets her self go to the Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of her Sentiments, without interessing the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riousness
of her Choice, nor that of her Conduct:
Happy, that in a Correspondence established for
the Sweetness of Life, contents her self with the
Approbation of ingenious Men, and her own Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction;
that fears not the Murmurs of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious,
who are jealous of all Pleasures, and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
against all Vertues.</p>
            <p>One knows by an Infinity of Experience, that
the Mind is blind in loving; and Love has as it
were, never well established his Power, till he has
ruined that of our Reason: Upon the Subject of
<hi>Aemilia</hi> our Sentiments become more passionate,
according as our Knowledge becomes more refined;
and the Passion, which always appeared a Mark of
Folly, is here the true Effect of our Happiness.</p>
            <p>The great Enemies of <hi>Aemilia</hi> are those that have
a false Knowledge of things, her Friends, all that
know how to judge of things with Discretion. One
has more, or less of Friendship for her, according as
one has more or less of Nicety; and every one thinks
to be the most curious, by knowing every day new
Passages, in order to love her more.</p>
            <p>Some Persons have no Occasion for this long dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning,
and for so slow a Meditation. At the first
sight they are touched with her Merit without the
Knowledge of it, and feel secret Motions of Esteem,
as well as Inclination for her. Scarce has she ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
six Words, but they find her the most reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
in the World: No body ever appeared to
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:44396:196"/>
them so ingenious, nor so wise, and as yet they
know neither her Procedure, nor her Conduct.
They frame, as it were by Instinct, the most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
Thoughts of her Vertue; aud Reason
being since consulted, instead of hiding the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize,
doth but approve of such happy, and just
Preventions.</p>
            <p>Amongst the Advantages of <hi>Aemilia,</hi> one of the
greatest, in my Opinion, is to be always the same,
and always pleasing. For one sees that the finest
Humour doth at length become tiresome: The
most fertile Spirits come to exhaust themselves, and
make you fall with them into a Langour; the most
enlivened Vivacities either repulse you, or weary
you. From whence comes it, that Women have
need of Fancies sometimes to stir us up, or else are
obliged to mix in their Entertainments Diversions,
that revive us? That which I describe pleases by
her self alone, and at all times an eternal Equality
never affords us a quarter of an Hour's distate. One
is glad to be able to find with others one agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Hour; with her one would complain of a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
Moment. Go and visit her in what Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
soever it be, upon what Occasion soever, you
go to a certain Pleasure, and to an assured Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
            <p>'Tis not an Imagination that surprizes you, and
presently after is troublesome to you. 'Tis not
a serious thing, that makes you purchase a solid
Conversation by the loss of its Gayety: 'tis a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that pleases, and a Judgment that's agreeable.
I'll conclude by the Quality, which ought to be
considered before all the rest. She is devout with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Superstition, without Melancholy; far from
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:44396:197"/>
that Infirmity, which frames Miracles particularly,
and perswades it self at all Moments of supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Fopperies; averse from those retired Humours,
which insensibly diffuse in the Mind the Hatred of
the World, and an Antipathy against Pleasures.</p>
            <p>She is not of Opinion, that one ought to retire
from Humane Society, to seek God in the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of Solitude: She doth not believe that
to be disengaged from a civil Life, to break the
most reasonable and dear Correspondences, is to
be united to God, but to be tied to ones self, and
foolishly pursue ones own Imagination: She thinks
to find God amongst Men, where his Goodness is
most active, and his Providence appears to be more
worthily employed; and there she seeks with him
to enlighten her Reason, to perfect her Manners,
to regulate her Conduct, both in the Cares of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
and the Duties of Life.</p>
            <p>Behold the Description of a Woman that is not
to be found; if so be one may make the Descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a thing that is not. 'Tis rather the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of an accomplished Person. I was not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to seek it amongst the Men, because there is
always wanting to their Commerce something of
that Sweetness, which one meets with in that of
Women; and I thought it less impossible to find in
a Woman the strongest and soundest Reason of
Men, than in a Man the Charms and Agreements
natural to Women.</p>
