            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>ON the Thirteenth of <hi>June</hi> being <hi>Fryday,</hi> Mr. <hi>Whitebread.</hi> Mr. <hi>Harcourt,</hi> Mr, <hi>Turner, Fenwick</hi> and <hi>Gaven</hi> of the Society, and Mr. <hi>Corker</hi> were brought to the Barr in the <hi>Old Bayly,</hi> Mr. <hi>Corker</hi> moved the Court for a longer time being only warned the night before, whereas the other Priſoners had eight days warning to prepare themſelves, whereupon he was remanded to Priſon till the next day then was the Indictment read againſt the five above named Jeſuits, for conſpiring the Kings death, Subverſion of Government and Proteſtant Religion then Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> ſwore that on the <hi>24th.</hi> of <hi>April</hi> there was a conſult held in <hi>London,</hi> where the death of the King was conſpired, and that he carryed this Reſolve from the one to the other, for their ſubſcribing, and ſwore particular circumſtances againſt each: to corroberate this Teſtimony, other Witneſſes <hi>Bedlow, Prance, Dugdale</hi> and <hi>Chetwin</hi> came in with overtures to the Matter ſworn by <hi>Oates,</hi> then did the Priſoners (after a moſt ſolemn and Religious proteſtation of their Innocence and ignorance of any conſpiracy againſt his Majeſty) deſire that their wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes might be heard, which could demonſtrate that Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> was actually at <hi>S. Omers</hi> all the whole time, but the Judge <hi>Scroggs</hi> askt each witneſs as he did appear, of what Religion he was, and upon anſwer that he was a <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> the whole Court gave a ſhout of laughter, then the Judge would ſay to them; well, what have you been taught to ſay, and by many ſcoffing queſtions (which moved the Court to frequent laughter) he did endeavour to take off the credibility of the witneſſes; then the <hi>Butler, Taylor,</hi> and <hi>Gardiner</hi> of St. <hi>Omers,</hi> offered to ſwear that they ſaw Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> all the time at St. <hi>Omers,</hi> when he ſwore he was at <hi>London,</hi> after that the Priſoners at the Barr produced ſixteen witneſſes more that proved Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> for ſworn in Mr. <hi>Irelands</hi> Tryal, becauſe he was in <hi>Shropſhire,</hi> when he atteſted he was in <hi>London,</hi> then did <hi>Gaven</hi> one of the Priſoners with a great deal of clearneſs and eloquence and with a cheerful countenance draw up their juſtification, ſhewing the face of their Evidence, and how fully their witneſſes had proved Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> purjured. Then he did lay open the improbability of ſuch a Plott, and how unlikely Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſhould be intruſted in delivering Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions to perſons of Honour, and Eſtates, whom he never (as he acknowledged) had ſeen before or ſince, this was delivered by Mr. <hi>Gawen</hi> with a countenance wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned, and in a voice very audible, and largely and pertinently expreſt, the Judge was incenſed at this ſpeech which he often interrupted him, but <hi>Gaven</hi> ſtill urg'd my <hi>Lord, I plead now for my Life, and for that which is dearer to me then life, the honour of my Religion, therefore I beſeech you have a little patience with me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After this Plea of Mr. <hi>Gavens</hi> the Judge made his Arrayne to the Jury telling them that what the Priſoners had brought was only the bare aſſertions of boyes, who were taught it as a point of their Religion, to lye for the honour of their Religion, whereas Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> and others were upon their Oathes, and if Oathes were not to be taken no Courts could ſubſiſt. Then Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> brought in four Witneſſes which he had kept in reſerve, an old Parſon in his Canonical Gown, an old <hi>Dominican</hi> Prieſt: <hi>Proh dolor &amp; pudor!</hi> and two women that ſwore they ſaw Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> in the beginning of <hi>May</hi> 1678. at this the whole Court gave a ſhout of laughter and hallow, that for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt a quarter the Cryers could not ſtill them; never was Bear-bayting more rude and boyſterous then this Tryal: Upon this the Judge diſmiſt the Jury, to conſider and bring in their Verdicts, who after half an hours abſence brought in the five Priſoners at the Barr all Guilty of High Treaſon; thereupon the whole Court clapt their hands and gave a great hallow, it being now eight at night, the Court adjourned till next day at ſeven a Clock which was <hi>Saturday,</hi> I was preſent from five in the morning till the Court broke up, the Priſoners componed themſelves moſt Apoſtolically at the Barr, not the leaſt paſſion or alteration appeared in them, at the invectives of the Judge, or at the clamours of the people, but made a clear and candid defence, with a cheerful and unconcerned countenance, (as a ſtander by ſaid) if they had been a Jury of Turke they had been quitted, I was with them both before and after their Tryal, and had the Honour to be in my Function ſerviceable to them, which I look upon as that God favoured me in, I hope for my future good: Next day Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> a Lawyer, Sir <hi>George Wakeman,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cooker,</hi> Mr. <hi>Marſh,</hi> Mr. <hi>Rumbly,</hi> the three laſt Benedictines, were brought to the Barr, where the Indictment being read againſt them for conſpiring the King's Death &amp;c. they pleaded all not guilty, then was <hi>Langhorn</hi> firſt tryed, whoſe Tryal held ſo long, that they had no time to Try the other four, and the Commiſſion by which they ſate, expiring that day, the Judge adjorned the Tryal of the other 4 till the <hi>14th</hi> of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and then the Judge commanded the Keeper to bring the five Jeſuits, whom with <hi>Langhorn</hi> were Sentenced to be Hang'd, Drawn and Quartered, Mr. <hi>Corker</hi> and Mr. <hi>Marſh</hi> are cloſe Priſoners, and have been ſo this eight months, with whom I have been, God has fitted and is ſtill fitting them as ſacrifices for himſelf, they are very well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and reſigned to God's holy will, Mr. <hi>Rumbly</hi> hath the Liberty of the Priſon, with whom is Mr. <hi>Eskett,</hi> all cheerful and expect the good hour; On <hi>Thurſday</hi> the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the five Jeſuits were Executed, my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> was with <hi>Turner</hi> and <hi>Gaven,</hi> promiſing the Kings Pardon if they would acknowledge the Conſpiracy, Mr. <hi>Gaven</hi> anſwered he would not murder his Soul to ſave his Body, for he muſt acknowledge what he knew not, and what he did believe was not.</p>
                  <p>On <hi>Friday</hi> the <hi>20th.</hi> of <hi>June</hi> Mr. <hi>Whitebread</hi> upon one Sledge with Mr. <hi>Harcourt,</hi> Mr. <hi>Turner</hi> and Mr. <hi>Gaven</hi> upon another Sledge, Mr. <hi>Fenwick</hi> upon a Sledge by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, were drawn from <hi>Newgate</hi> to <hi>Tiburn,</hi> Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> is for a time Repreived and promiſed Pardon, if he will (as tis Reported) diſcover the Eſtates of the Jeſuites, he was their Lawyer tis certain, my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> has been often with him.</p>
                  <p>In the way they comported themſelves ſeriouſly and cheerfully, Mr. <hi>Gaven</hi> had ſmug'd himſelf up as if he had been going to a Wedding; when they arrived at <hi>Tiburn</hi> they each made a Speech, firſt, all averring their ignorance of any Plott againſt His Majeſty, ſecondly, pardoning their Accuſers, thirdly, hartily p<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aying for them.</p>
                  <p>But Mr. <hi>Gaven</hi> in his Speech made an Act of Contrition which was much liked by all, for he was an excellent Preacher: then they all betook themſelves to Meditation, for more then a good quarter, the multitude was great, yet there was a profound ſilence, and their moſt Religious comportment has wonderfully allayed the fury of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; when they had ended their Prayers, and the Ropes were about their necks there came an Horſeman in full ſpeed from <hi>White Hall,</hi> crying as he Rode, a Pardon, a Pardon, ſo with difficulty he made through the Preſs to the Sheriff, who was under the Gallows to ſee Execution performed; then was the Pardon read, which expreſſed, <hi>How the King moſt graciouſly and out of his inclination to Clemency had granted them their lives, which by Treaſon they had forfeited, upon condition they would acknowledge the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy and lay open what they knew thereof.</hi> But they all thanked his Majeſty for his inclination of mercy towards them, but as to any Conſpiracy they knew of none much leſs are guilty of any, ſo they could not accept of any Pardon upon thoſe conditions, after a little Recollection the Cart was driven away, after they were dead they were Quartered, but their Quarters were given to their friends, <hi>Sanguis Martyrum ſit ſemen Eccleſiae.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſent to you an accompt of Mr. <hi>Puckerings</hi> death, and will tell you what may happen, but I know not if they come to you, you may cover your Letter to me, for Mrs. <hi>
