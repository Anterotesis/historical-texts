            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT is one of the Encomiums given to <hi>Suetonius,</hi> That he made Publick to the World, the Vices and Miscarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Twelve <hi>Caesars,</hi> with the same freedom with which they were by them Committed. And there is no question, but one of his chiefest reasons for so doing, was this, Because he would not deceive Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and all agree that he was Contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary with the Three last. So that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normities of <hi>Domitian</hi> could not but be fresh in his Memory when he wrote his Life; and there might be several Persons Living, as might have the same Partial Affections for <hi>Domitian,</hi> as there are now Adorers of <hi>C. II.</hi> and <hi>J. II.</hi> For which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son there is a wary Caution among some People, That Truth is not always to be spoken. Which perhaps may be sometimes True, but as the Case stands with these Sheets, not at all to be taken notice of; The pains of this short History, being as
<pb facs="tcp:62803:4"/>
well to Vindicate, as to Inform; and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Opposition to one of the <hi>French</hi> King's most Scandalous Libels, and bitter Invectives against our Present Sovereign; Intitled, <hi>The True Portraicture of</hi> Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Henry <hi>of</hi> Nassau, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now to have made a Particular Answer to all the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies and Impertinent Flams of a Malicious Libeller, would have been a Fending and Proving, altogether fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less. It was therefore thought the more concise way, to bring the Two Last Reigns upon the Stage, and then let all the World judg of the Furberies and Tyranny of those Times, and the Integrity, Sincerity, and Sweetness of Their Present Majesties Reign. As for the Truth of what is here contain'd, I will not Apologize for it; for as to the more secret Transactions, the Consequences and Events are my Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; and for what was more publickly carried, there are the loud and general Complaints of the Kingdom to confirm it. So that I shall say no more.</p>

            <head>THE SECRET HISTORY, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>WHEN <hi>Charles</hi> the Second was restored to the Thrones of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> never any Monarch in the World, came to the Possession of so large a Dominion with more Advantages to have done good for himself, to his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects at home, and to his Allies abroad: The People all experienc'd in Martial Discipline, as having but newly sheath'd the Sword of Civil War and Foreign Conquest, so that their Valour was dreaded abroad where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he should have menac'd an Enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Territories. Besides all this, he had the Love of his Subjects, equal, if not superior, to any Prince that ever reign'd before him; and he had the Affection of <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>is Parliament to the highest degree.</p>
            <p>But after all this, he was no sooner set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

with Effeminate Pleasures, he abandon'd himself to all manner of Softness and Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous Enjoyments, and harbouring in his Bosom the worst of Vices, base Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, betray'd himself that he might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray his People. For where the Constitution of a Nation is such, that the Laws of the Land are the Measures both of the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns Commands, and the Obedience of the Subjects; whereby it is provided, that as the one are not to invade what by Concessions and Stipulations is granted to the Ruler, so the other is not to deprive them of their lawful and determin'd Rights and Liberties; there the Prince who strives to subvert the Fundamental Laws of the Society is the Traytor and the Rebel, and not the People who endeavour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve and defend their own. Nor must we ascribe the Miscarriages of his Reign altogether to the remissness of his Nature; but to a Principle of Revenge, which his Mother had infus'd into him, not so much for the loss of her Husband, but out of her inbred Malice to the Protestant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which no where flourish'd in that Splendour as in <hi>England,</hi> foster'd an<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> cherished by the vow'd Enemy of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, his Brother the D. of <hi>York,</hi> who ha<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> been openly heard to declare in his Bed

chamber at St. <hi>Iames</hi>'s,
<q>That he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd to be reveng'd upon the <hi>English</hi> Nation for the Death of his Father:</q>
And what an Ascendant this Brother had over him, the whole Kingdom has felt by sad and woful experience. For indeed the King had all along an Affection for him, so entire and baneful to the Nation, that he could only be said to Reign, while his Brother Rul'd. With all these Royal Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and imbred and fomented Animosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to render him at his return a Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Sovereign to this Kingdom, let us trace him from his Cradle to find out those Princely Endowments, which invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly encreasing with him as he grew in Years, dazled in such a manner the Eyes of the doating Politicians of that Age, to recal him, against that known and vulgar Maxim of Common Prudence.</p>
            <q>
               <l>— Regnabit sanguine multo</l>
               <l>Ad Regnum quisquis venit ab exilio.</l>
            </q>
            <p>When he was but very young, he had a very strange an unaccountable Fondness to a wooden Billet, without which in his Arms he would never go abroad, nor lie down in his Bed: From which the more observing sort of People gathered, that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62803:6"/>
when he came to Years of Maturity, either Oppressors and Blockheads would be his greatest Favourites; or else that when he came to reign, he would either be like <hi>Iupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s Log for every Body to deride and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn; or that he would rather chuse to command his People with a Club, than rule them with a Scepter. And indeed they that made the first and last Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures found in due time they were not altogether in the wrong. For the Throne was no sooner empty by the death of his Father, before he could be permitted to seat himself in it, but he gave us a plain discovery what sort of People they were, who when he came to Reign were most likely to have the Principal Room in his Favour and Trust, and by whose assistance he was in hopes to tyrannize over his <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Scottish</hi> Subjects.</p>
            <p>For when the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> sent to him, as he was then cruizing about <hi>Guernsey,</hi> to treat with him about receiving him to be their King, he would not so much as transact with them, till he had first sent to <hi>Ireland,</hi> to assure himself whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther those Rebels, who had murder'd no less than two hundred thousand Protestants were in a condition or no for him to cast himself upon their Assistance. But those
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62803:6"/>
hopes failing, in regard they were in a fair way to be subdu'd themselves, he was at length inclin'd to entertain the Overture made him by the <hi>Scots.</hi> And yet even then was his mind so full fraught with the thoughts of Despotical Dominion, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses of introducing Popery into his Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, that had it not been for the P. of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range,</hi> he would never have comply'd with the Terms which the <hi>Scots</hi> had order to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, tho' no other than what were neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for the security of the Lives, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Laws, and Religion of his People. And how he employ'd his wooden Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let afterwards, may easily be understood by his many acts of barbarous Tyranny over those poor People, and the Slavery under which the whole Nation began so lately to groan.</p>
            <p>Being admitted to the Scepter of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> at what time the Scourge of <hi>English</hi> Victory hung hourly over his Head; tho he was diligently watched and observ'd by Men of Piety and Vertue, he could not forbear the satisfaction of his Youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Inclinations to all manner of Wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Lasciviousness: insomuch that having in the Year 1650 to the many For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications and Adulteries which he there committed, added the perpetration of a Rape
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62803:7"/>
upon a modest and vertuous Lady, he had incurr'd the general disatisfaction of his best Friends. However since they had brought him in, and restored him to the Regal Dignity, and that what was done could not now be undone, they deem'd it no less their Duty, to retrieve him, if possible, from those infamous and violent Courses, and to that purpose concluded, that the Danger, as well as the Sin and Scandal of the Crimes he had committed, should be privately represented to him by some of the most sober Noble Men and Ministers. But some declining the Office, as apprehending it would be ungratefully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the young King, others not deeming they had that Awe upon him which was sufficient, it came at length to be devolv'd upon the Marquiss of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyle.</hi> For they suppos'd, that if he heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to any Person it would be to him, not only by reason of his Quality, but because he had been the chief Instrument of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading and prevailing with the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to call him home to inherit the Crown of his Ancestors, when most of the Members were thinking to exclude him. But tho that Noble and Prudent Peer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd the Address, which upon that Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion he made to the King, with the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62803:7"/>
Piety of a Christian, and the greatest Submission of a Subject; yet the King look'd upon it as so Sacrilegious a Crime, that any one should presume to rebuke him for his Darling Pollutions and Impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that he resolv'd that nothing should expiate the Offence but the Blood of that Great and Vertuous Nobleman.</p>
            <p>It is true, he was destroyed upon a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended legal Process, but they who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd that it was for strain'd Faults and Failings of a Person who never acted but in a publick joint way, without any sinister or treasonable Design against the King or his Father, and against which he was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther able to defend himself by Acts of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation or Oblivion <hi>in verbo principis,</hi> then which there could not be a more Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream, Sacred, and inviolable Security; or by an insuperable Necessity: They who remembred the Marquisse's faithful Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours for restoring the King to the Crown of <hi>Scotland,</hi> thought it a severe Case, and look'd upon his Condemnation as unjust, and his Life an ungodly Sacrifice to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred Lust of a Lascivious Prince. He had called God and all the Records of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to witness his Innocency, as to the most pungent Articles against him; and to avoid giving the Parliament the trouble of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62803:8"/>
in all humility he threw himself down at the Kings Feet, and wholly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted himself to his Mercy. Nay, when all this would not do, he put in a Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication for himself, so full of Reason and good Proof, as was thought would have satisfied all Mankind. But notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all this, such was the remorceless Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty of our good natur'd Prince of Mercy and Clemency, that nothing but so Noble a Person must be a Victim to his private Animosity.</p>
            <p>Nor does the getting him put to death by a seeming Course of Law excuse or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate the Guilt of the Fact, but is rather an Aggravation of it before God and Men, in regard the Law which is design'd for the security of Men's Lives, was here wrested and perverted to their Destruction.</p>
            <p>And in imitation of this unjust Prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it was, that when the D. of <hi>York</hi> hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Son of this Noble Man to death, and was told by the <hi>Scot</hi>'s Lawyers, that there was nothing in what the Earl had said or done which could be made Criminal by the Law of the Land, his Highness was pleas'd to reply, <hi>But cannot it be wrested to Treason</hi>?</p>
            <p>Nor was the King less early in Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie and breach of Promise. For the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62803:8"/>
of which to be a Solemn Truth, there needs no more than to lay the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Proof upon his own Words and Solemn Engagements. For in the Kings Letter to the Speaker of the House of Commons just before his Restauration, he has these Words.</p>
            <q>
               <p>We assure you upon our Royal Word that none of our Predecessors have had a greater esteem of Parliaments than We have, as well in Our Judgments as from Our Obligation. We do believe them to be so Vital a part of the Constitution of the Kingdom, and so necessary for the Government of it, that We well know, neither Prince nor People can be in any tolerable degree happy without them; and therefore you may be confident, that We shall always look upon their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, as the best We can receive, and shall be as tender of their Priviledges, and as careful to preserve and protect them, as of that which is most near our Self, and most necessary for our own Preservation.</p>
            </q>
            <p>This in part demonstrates his Prevarica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with Man: Now for his Prevarica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with Heaven, we must produce ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Paragraph of the same Letter, wherein he uses these flattering Expressions.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:62803:9"/>
               <p>If you desire the Advancement and Propagation of the Protestant Religion, We have, by our constant Profession of it, given sufficient Testimony to the World, That neither the unkindness of those of the same Faith towards Us, nor the Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Obligations from those of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Profession, could in the least de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree startle Us, or make Us swerve from it, and nothing can be propos'd to manifest Our Zeal and Affection for it, to which we will not readily assent. And We hope in due time our Self to propose something to you for the Propagation of it, that will satisfie the World, that We have always made it both Our Care and Study, and have enough observed what is most like to bring disadvantage to it.</p>
            </q>
            <p>As for the first, his Veneration for Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, the succeeding Transactions of his Reign, which are to be related, will manifestly make it appear how far those Words were from his Heart, when dictated by his Lips.</p>
            <p>And as for the second, his Zeal for the Protestant Religion, nothing could render him more a Hypocrite then such a Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, when at the same time he was both himself a Papist, and under Promises and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62803:9"/>
to the Pope and the <hi>Romish</hi> Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, to destroy the Protestant and introduce the <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Religion, as afterwards appear'd by the Attestations of Ocular Witnesses, who often saw him at Mass du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his Exile: and was yet more evident by a Letter under his own Hand, written in the Year 1652. to the Pope himself; which once was printed in <hi>Whitlocks Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs</hi>; but upon the considerations of the danger that might ensue upon divulging it at that time to the World, torn out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the publishing of the Book. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever to supply that defect, we shall here insert the Propositions that were sent by him to <hi>Rome,</hi> while he was in <hi>Scotland,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Religion, and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thither and press'd forward by one <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,</hi> an <hi>Irish</hi> Priest, and Confessor to the then Queen of <hi>Portugal,</hi> under the Title of <hi>Propositions and Motives for and on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the most Invincible King of</hi> Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, France, <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>to Pope</hi> Innocent X. <hi>in the Year of Iubilee</hi> 1650.

                  <p>Our Agent at present residing at <hi>Rome,</hi> with all humility shews to your Holiness, That the principal cause and occasion of that Regicide tyrannically perpetrated upon the Person of <hi>Charles</hi> the First, Father of that foresaid <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, by his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels and cruel Subjects (the like whereof was never heard of from the beginning of the world, not only not among civil Nations, but even among the most barbarous them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves) have been the graces, favors and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so often and so many ways extended to the Catholick Religion, and the Assertors and Professors thereof, in the Kingdoms both of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland:</hi> The truth of which appears, in that the foresaid <hi>Charles</hi> the First gave Authority to the Marquiss of <hi>Ormond</hi> by several Commissions, for the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablishing and perfecting all Conditions with the Confederate Catholicks of the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> of sufficient security for the Catholick Faith. Furthermore, the said <hi>Charles</hi> the First, tearing lest the said <hi>Ormond</hi> (being an Heretick) should not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the said Confederates in all things; He sent thither the Marquiss of <hi>Worcester,</hi> a Man truly and wholly Catholick, with a more ample Commission; in which Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62803:10"/>
the said Marquiss of <hi>Worcester</hi> had full Authority of concluding a Peace with the said Confederate Catholicks, and of giving them Conditions altogether satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, as well concerning Liberty of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; as also as to other Injuries that had been done unto them, which the said Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiss of <hi>Worcester,</hi> making with them an absolute Peace, did abundantly fulfil.</p>
                  <p>Further, this appeareth in that the said <hi>Charles</hi> the First, even in <hi>England</hi> it self, did by Commissions set the Catholicks, namely the said Marquiss of Worcester, Sir <hi>Arthur Ashton,</hi> and many others, over his Armies, and made them Governours of Cities, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and strong Holds, notwithstanding the clamour of the People against it, and which was not a slight Motive of the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide committed upon him, whereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that although the said King <hi>Charles</hi> the First died not a Catholick, yet he died for them.</p>
                  <p>Again, (most blessed Father!) the same Agent most humbly represents, That the present King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, the true and undoubted Heir of the foresaid <hi>Charles</hi> the First, and of all his Kingdoms (to whom the said Kingdoms belong of right, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that of Christ, <hi>Give to Caesar the things that are Caesar's,</hi>) while his Father yet
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62803:11"/>
lived, was known to have good and true Natural inclinations to the Catholick Faith, following which, and going on in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers steps, he did not only recommend it to the Marquiss of <hi>Ormond,</hi> but gave it him in express Command to satisfie in all things the Confederate Catholicks in <hi>Ireland,</hi> namely, That he should grant them the free exercise of their Religion, That he should abrogate the Penal Laws made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, and that he should restore to the said Catholicks, whether Laicks or Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticks, their Lands, Estates, Possessions, or what other Rights did at any time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto them, and by the said Laws had been unjustly taken away; in obedience to which Commands, the said Marquiss in the Name, and by the Authority of the said two Kings, namely, <hi>Charles</hi> the First and the II. made and concluded a firm Peace with the said Confederate Catholicks; by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of which Peace, the said present King and all his Dominions, hath involved himself with the Catholicks in an irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable War against the Parliamentarian Regicides of <hi>England,</hi> whose Blood there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the said cruel Tyrants insatiably thirst after, as they did after his Fathers.</p>
                  <p>The said Agent further offers to your Holiness, That the inhumane Regicides do
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62803:11"/>
wickedly usurp to themselves in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions aforementioned, all the Authority of the King, do most cruelly persecute all the Catholicks both in <hi>England</hi> and in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> partly by condemning them to Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, partly by thrusting them into Prisons, and otherwise corporally punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them; and lastly, by putting them to death, a Witness of the truth hereof, is that great slaughter made by <hi>Cromwel,</hi> in the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the two Cities of <hi>Drogheda</hi> and <hi>Wexford,</hi> and other places, where all the Catholicks without distinction of either Sex or Age were slaughtered; witness hereof also the raging persecution and death of Catholicks in <hi>England</hi>: by all which, and by their Parliamentarian Decrees, themselves, and their Covenant with God (as they call it) it is evident even beyond the clearness of the light of the shining Sun, That these Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical Regicides do ultimately intend and put forth all their Power for the utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of all Catholicks, and to extirpate by the Roots, and wholly to extinguish the Catholick Faith throughout the World, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly asserting and boasting with great glory, that these things being once finished in those Dominions, they will then invade <hi>France,</hi> and after that run through <hi>Germany, Italy,</hi> and all <hi>Europe,</hi> throwing down Kings
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62803:12"/>
and Monarchs, whose very Titles are most odious and abhorrent unto them: Briefly, they have no other thing in their Aim than these two, namely, The extirpation of the Catholick Religion, and the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Monarchy: To which wicked Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinations of theirs, forasmuch as they could never have any the least hopes, that either the King or his Father should at any time in the least assent; they have put the one to death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the other to exile: And these Rebels now with a nefarious boldness, have lately called themselves a Common-wealth.</p>
                  <p>To meet with and prevent the infernal endeavours of such Rebels, our Agent most humbly offers to your Holiness the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Propositions.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. That your Holiness would make an annual supply out of your own Treasury unto the said <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, of consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable sums of Money, sutable to the maintaining the War against those Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels against God, the Church, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy.</item>
                     <item>2. That you would cause and compel the whole beneficed Clergy in the world, of whatsoever Dignity, Degree, State or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition soever, to contribute the third or the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62803:12"/>
fourth part of all their Fruits, Rents, Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, or Emoluments to the said War, as being Universal and Catholick. And that the said Contribution may be paid every Three Months or otherwise, as shall seem most expedient to your Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</item>
                     <item>3. That by your Apostolick <hi>Nuncio's</hi> your Holiness would most instantly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with all Princes, Common-wealths, and Catholick States, that the said Princes, Common-wealths, and States, may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished in the bowels of Jesus Christ, and induced to enter into, and conclude an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Peace; and that they will unitedly supply the said King. And that they will by no means acknowledg the said Regicides and Tyrants for a Common-wealth, or State; nor enter into, or have any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with them.</item>
                     <item>4. That by the said <hi>Nuncio</hi>'s, or any other way, all and every the Monarchs of all <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> may be timely admonished, and made sensible in this Cause; wherein, beside the detriment of the Faith, their own proper Interest is concerned: The foresaid Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants being sworn enemies to all Monarchy, as they themselves do openly assert, both by Word and Writing; and to that end, both in <hi>Germany, Spain, France, Polonia,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62803:13"/>
and in the very Dominions of the <hi>Great Turk,</hi> they have raised dangerous Insurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; being raised, they foment them: and to that purpose, they supply the Charge, and make large Contributions to it.</item>
                     <item>5. That your Holiness would command, under pain of Excommunication, <hi>ipso facto,</hi> all and singular Catholicks, That neither they, nor any of them, directly nor indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, by Land or by Sea, do serve them in Arms, or assist them by any Counsel, or help to favour or supply them any way, under whatsoever pretext.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Holy Father! The premised Remedies are timely to be applied, by which the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Faith, now exposed to extreme and imminent hazard, may be conserv'd; an infinite number of Catholicks may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd from destruction, Monarchy may be established; and the most invincible King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> restor'd to his Rights: All which things will bear your Holiness to Heaven with their Praises, whom God long conserve in safety, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Propositions and Motives abovesaid (if occasion be) our Agent will more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly set forth <hi>viva voce.</hi>

            </floatingText>
            <p>Nor could there be a more evident De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration of the Kings kind Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62803:13"/>
to the Head of the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion, whom he had so dutifully courted from <hi>Scotland,</hi> then that soon after his Return, he justify'd the Bloody Massacre commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Papists in <hi>Ireland</hi> in the Year 1641. For that the Lord <hi>Antrim</hi> appearing at the Court of Claims guilty of those exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable Murthers, and of that most detestable Rebellion, and being thereupon to forfeit his Estate, as he had justly deserv'd, the King, by a Letter under his own Hand, as well to the Privy Council, as to that Court, avow'd, That whatever the said Lord had done, it was by Commission and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from his Father; Which as it serves to clear a great portion of our Doubts and Suspicions of the Son's Integrity to the Protestant Religion; so it was a shrewd Argument, that all that glister'd in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was not Gold.</p>
            <p>But being eager to be restor'd, he was forc'd to put on a Protestant Mask, and to wear one Religion in his Face, another in his Heart; and no question but he had Plenary Toleration from his Ghostly Father for what he did. He had watchful Eyes over him. And to shew that as he was a great Lover of Comedies and Enterludes, so he could act his part with e're a <hi>Moon</hi> or <hi>Lacy</hi> of 'em all, there is a Story must not
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62803:14"/>
be omitted, which may serve to light us into the Occasion how he came to gain the Addition of <hi>Pious.</hi> Otherwise, as it is impossible for us to give any Account why <hi>Virgil</hi> so often gives the Epiphet of <hi>Pious</hi> to his Hero <hi>AEneas,</hi> after he had so dishonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably cheated and broke his Faith with Queen <hi>Dido</hi>; so is it as little to be expected that we should afford a Reason why <hi>Charles</hi> the Second should be so universally digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd with the Name of <hi>Pious,</hi> after such a Prank of Hypocrisie as we are going to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late. Certainly he could not be thought to be akin to <hi>AEneas</hi>; for we can never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce his Extraction from the Loins of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chises</hi> (perhaps from <hi>Venus</hi> we might) and therefore the Cause must be sought for nearer home. Well then, the Story is this.</p>
            <p>While he lay at <hi>Breda,</hi> daily expecting the <hi>English</hi> Navy for his Transportation, the Dissenting Party fearing the worst, thought it but reasonable to send a select Number of their most eminent Divines to wait upon his Majesty in <hi>Holland,</hi> in order to get the most advantageous Promises from him they could, for the Liberty of their Consciences. Of the number of these Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, Mr. <hi>Case</hi> was one, who with the rest of his Brethren coming where the King lay, and desiring to be admitted into the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62803:14"/>
King's Presence, were carried up into the Chamber next or very near the King's Closet, but told withal, That the King was busie at his Devotions, and that till he had done they must be contented to stay. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus left alone (by Contrivance no doubt) and hearing a sound of groaning Piety, such was the Curiosity of Mr. <hi>Case,</hi> that he would needs go and lay his Ear to the Closet door. But, Heavens! how was the good Old Man ravish'd to hear the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Ejaculations that fell from the King's Lips!— <hi>Lord,—since thou art pleas'd to restore me to the Throne of my Ancestors, grant me a Heart constant in the Exercise and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of thy True Protestant Religion.— Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver may I seek the Oppression of those who out of the tenderness of their Consciences are not free to conform to Outward and Indifferent Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies.</hi> — With a great deal more of the same Cant.— Which Mr. <hi>Case</hi> having over-heard, full of Joy and Transport, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to his Brethren, with Hands and Eyes to Heaven up-lifted, fell a congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the Happiness of Three Nations over which the Lord had now plac'd a Saint of Paradise for their Prince. After which, the King coming out of his Closet, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded Ministers were ready to prostrate themselves at his Feet; and then it was
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62803:15"/>
that the King gave them those Promises of his Favour and Indulgence, which how well he after perform'd, they felt to their sorrow.</p>
            <p>Soon after he arriv'd in <hi>England,</hi> where he was receiv'd with all the Pomp and Splendour, and all the Demonstrations of Joy that a Nation could express; but then, as if he had left all his Piety behind him in <hi>Holland,</hi> care was taken against the very first Night that his Sacred Majesty was to lie at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> to have the Lady <hi>Castlemain</hi> seduc'd from her Loyalty to her Husband, and entic'd into the Arms of the happily restor'd Prince. Which was not only Adultery, but Incest in the Lord's Annoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it being the Opinion of several Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, who had reason to know more than others did, that she was his Sister by the Mother's Side, as being begotten by the E. of <hi>St. A.</hi> upon the Queen's Body, after the Death of <hi>C.</hi> the First: which is the rather to be believ'd, for that I my self have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten heard Mr. <hi>R. Osborn,</hi> then at <hi>Paris</hi> with the Exil'd King, affirm, That he saw the said E. and the Queen solemnly marry'd together.</p>
            <p>But he was more kind to the D. of <hi>Portsmouth,</hi> than to any of his Mistresses; and thence it was, that she might not lie
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62803:15"/>
under the Scandal of being a Whore, that after he had made her a Dutchess, he made her also his Wife; that is to say, he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd her by vertue of his Royal Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, at the Lord <hi>A</hi>'s House, by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer-Book, according to the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> A thing in some measure justifiable in a Prince, since the Law allows all Men one Wife; and therefore a King, who is above Law, may surely have two. And upon this ground perhaps it was, that upon a Lord Mayor's Day, being at Mr. <hi>Eaton</hi>'s in <hi>Cheapside,</hi> where the King usually stood, upon some Discourse that brought it out, she cry'd; <hi>Me no Whore; if me thought me were a Whore, me would cut mine own Throat.</hi> And by the same Dispensing Power he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided also for her Children: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore having no less adulterously begotten a Daughter upon the Lady <hi>Wood,</hi> he join'd her in holy Wedlock to one of his Sons whom he had begot after the same Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate manner upon the Body of the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chess of <hi>Cleveland</hi>; according to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer of <hi>Tamar</hi> to <hi>Ammon,</hi> of which he wanted not Sycophant Priests enow to put him in mind.</p>
            <p>But these were Peccadillo's readily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given by the Religion which he inwardly
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62803:16"/>
embrac'd, which could readily dispense with such Trifles as these, provided he went thorough-stitch with the Work which his Ghostly Fathers had cut out for him. Which was the reason, perhaps, that he made choice of a Devotion so conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his lustful Inclinations. For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly what was said of <hi>Harry</hi> the Eighth, might much more properly he said of him, That he spar'd no Woman, whether Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, Marry'd, or Widow, in his Venereal Heats; Which fill'd his Court so full of Pimps and Panders, that there was hardly any Preferment about his Person for any other. This was that which render'd the D. of <hi>L.</hi> one of the most ill-favour'd of Men, so amiable in our <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Eyes: And this was that which advanced several others to their gilded Coaches, and Places of the greatest Honour and Profit about the Court. Tho nothing was more mournful, then to see those vast Sums of Money which the Parliament so profusely gave him for the Honour and Security of the Nation, so extravagantly and prodigally wasted upon his Strumpets, of which two were Common Harlots, of Actresses taken from the Bawdy Stage to his Royal Bed. A thousand Pounds every <hi>Munday</hi>-morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for the Smiles of a Gilt; when his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62803:16"/>
Servants pin'd and starv'd for want of their weekly Board-wages, and the strength of the Kingdom, his Seamen, were forc'd to serve his Enemies for Bread.</p>
            <p>Thus from the first hour of his Arrival into these Kingdoms, (for I dare not call them <hi>His</hi>) he set himself by his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion and influence to withdraw both Men and Women from the Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Morality, and to pollute and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the People with all manner of Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery and Wickedness. He that ought to have shone like the North Star in the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament of Royalty, to direct his Subjects in the Paths of Vertue and Honesty, was the Sovereign <hi>Ignis fatuus</hi> to misguide them into all the snares of Ruin and Perdition, Execrable Oaths were the Chief Court-Acknowledgements of a Deity; Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Adulteries the Principal Tests of the Peoples Loyalty and Obedience. And whether it were to affront God who had preserved and restored him to his Throne, or to be reveng'd upon the Nation, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting him so unanimously to weild the Scepter of his Ancestors, certain it is, that he made it his business to live in defiance of the Fear and Authority of God, and to poyson and corrupt the Minds, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prave the Manners of the <hi>English</hi> People, as
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62803:17"/>
might easily be observed through the whole Course of his Reign.</p>
            <p>But the King had been well instructed in his Exile, and had sufficiently learnt in his banishment that undoubted Maxim of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, that the only way to alter the settl'd Government of a Nation, and to introduce Slavery and Popery, the support of Thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, was to weaken and make soft the Military Temper of the People by Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery and Effeminacy, which generally go hand in hand together. Knowing therefore that <hi>Regis ad Exemplum totus componitur Orbis,</hi> he gave these lewd Examples himself, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that after he had thus Enervated the Minds and Resolutions of his Subjects, he might the more easily trample upon their Necks, and reduce them under the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Yoke of Antichrist, in expectation of his Mothers Blessing, and to fulfil the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement between himself, the Pope, and the <hi>French</hi> King.</p>
            <p>Certain it is, that the Kingdom was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in a better Posture for the King to work upon it, then at the time of his return into <hi>England.</hi> For such were the Contests for Superiority, among those who had taken upon them the Government after the death of <hi>Oliver,</hi> such the Confusions and Disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that from thence arose, that no body
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62803:17"/>
could probably see where would be the End of the general Distraction, unless it were by reducing all things to their Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Condition, under a Prince whose Title was so fair to the Crown. Though a great Blunder in Politicks, which the necessity of Affairs at that time made to pass for an Act of Prudence. But such an Act it was, to which all Parties were the more inflam'd by the Kings reiterated Oaths, Promises, and Declarations, to those of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to maintain the Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; to the Dissenters, that he would indulge their tender Consciences with all the Liberty they could rationally desire, and to All in general, that he was a most really zealous, and unalterable Protestant. And so infatuated they were with these ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating Wheedles, that should all that knew him beyond Sea, both at <hi>Colen</hi> and in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> have spoken their discoveries with the Voices of Angels; nay should the Letter which he wrote with his own hand in the year Sixty two to the Pope, have been shewn them in Capital Letters, they would have been all lookt upon but as Ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Inventions to obstruct the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Nation. The People there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ador'd him as the end of all their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series, the Dissenters, upon the Relations
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62803:18"/>
of their Ministers return'd, thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves happy in the reports of his Mercy and Piety, and the Parliament doated upon his Oaths and Promises, so that no Prince in the World could ascend a Throne with more Love and Affection, or with a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Reputation in the Opinion of the whole Nation. What could be more inhuman, more immoral, more barbarous, then by all the Violations of Royal Faith and the Word of a King, to disappoint the Hopes and Expectations of a People that had such a Confidence of his Religion and Vertue? Though perhaps such a failure might have been attributed to his Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and want of Conduct. But to set him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, after so high a Veneration of his Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, such a prostrating of their Lives and Fortunes at his Feet, in Combination with a Forreign Prince, the only professed and mortal Enemy of their Welfare, to destroy their Religion, subvert their Laws and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, to undermine and impoverish their Estates and Fortunes, and to reduce a Plump, Wealthy, and Well-nourish'd Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, into a <hi>Skeleton</hi> of a Kingdom, what could be more infernally ingrateful? Yet that this was the Study and Practice of his whole Reign, the following Passages will make Geometrically demonstrable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:62803:18"/>The King was not ignorant that he was furnish'd already with a stock of Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who being forc'd to share the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes of his Exile, and consequently no less imbitter'd against those whom they lookt upon as their Oppressors, he had moulded them to his own Popish Religion and Interests, by corrupting them in their Banishment with him, to renounce the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Doctrine and Worship, and secretly reconcile themselves to the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> Insomuch that Mr. <hi>R.</hi> offer'd to prove one day, in the Pensionary House of <hi>Commons,</hi> that of all the Persons, yet Persons all of Rank and Quality, who so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ'd with the King abroad, there were but three then alive, <hi>viz.</hi> P. <hi>Rupert,</hi> the Lord <hi>M.</hi> and Mr. <hi>H. Coventry,</hi> who had not been prevail'd upon by his Majesty to go to Mass. Nor could their being restor'd to their Estates at his return, separate them from their Masters Interests; for that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the future Expectations, with which the King continually fed them, and the Obligations that the Principles of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, to which they had revolted, layd them under, they had bound themselves, by all the Oaths and Promises that could be exacted from them, to assist and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operate with him in all his Designs for the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62803:19"/>
Extirpation of the Protestant Religion and introducing of Popery; though they were dispenced with from appearing bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac'd. So soon therefore as the Parliament that gave him admittance into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was Dissolv'd, the King call'd another, the first of his own Calling; and so or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Matter, that the greatest part of the Mask'd Revolters got in amongst the Real Protestants: By which means all things went trim and trixy on the King's side. They restor'd him the <hi>Militia,</hi> which the Long Parliament had wrested out of his Fathers hands; they sacrific'd the Treasure of the Nation to his Profuseness and Prodigali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the only Vertue in him that sav'd us from utter Ruin; for had he been more sparing he had done us more mischief. They of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd up the Rights and Liberties of the People, by advancing his Prerogative; and what was most conducing to the King's Popish Designs, they made him, by private Instructions, those Penal Statutes, which divided the two prevailing Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Parties, and set them together by the Ears, by arming one Party of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants against all the rest; such a darling advantage to the Papists, and upon the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of which, he set so high a value, that neither the necessity of his Affairs at
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62803:19"/>
any time afterwards, nor the Application and Interposure of several Parliaments, for removing the grounds of our Differences and Animosities by an <hi>Indulgence</hi> to be past into a Law, could prevail upon him to forego the advantages he had got of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Protestants at mutual Enmity one with another, and making them useful to their own Designs, of supplanting the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Religion, and re-establishing the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry of <hi>Rome.</hi> Nor was this all, but that he might carry on his Popish Designs the more safely and covertly under the cursed Mask of Hypocrisie, he procur'd the passing of an Act in his Pensionary Parliament 1662. whereby it was made forfeiture of Estate and Imprisonment, <hi>for any to say the King was a Papist, or an Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducer of Popery.</hi> Nevertheless, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing he was thus become a Protestant by the Law of the Land, to repeat how he exerted the Power given him by the P2r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; how he persecuted and prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Protestant Nonconformists from one end of the Kingdom to the other; how he caus'd them to be Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, imprison'd and harrass'd, when nto a Papist in the Three Kingdoms was so much as troubled or molested, is a thing that would be altogether needless, as being
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62803:20"/>
so well known to the World, and still too sadly remembred by Thousands of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, that to this day too deeply wear the Scars of his Cruel Dilaniations. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it shew'd sufficiently the aim of our dear Defender of the Protestant Faith, which was to weaken and enervate the Protestant Party, that so they might be come the more easie Prey to Popish Rage and Cruelty, when the blessed Hour should arrive, for the putting in Execution those bloody designs with which he had been so long travailing; which because he could not carry on without assistance, therefore although he were sometimes oblig'd by the necessity of his Affairs, and in complyance with the Times, to palliate his Contrivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to make use of sincere and real Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, yet they who were admitted into his secrets, and in whom he placed his chiefest Trust and Confidence, were always Papists. He who would needs have himself enacted the best Protestant in his Dominions, took no notice, that whosoever was reconciled to <hi>Rome,</hi> stood debarr'd from all Offices, and obnoxious to several kinds of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but still out of the number of Papists, or else such as were of no Religion at all, (which was the same thing for his purposes) chose his Embassadors, Generals, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62803:20"/>
of State, and many of his greatest Bishops too. What else recommended Sir <hi>W. Godolphin</hi> to be Embassador in <hi>Spain,</hi> or Sir <hi>Lionel I.</hi> to be his Plenipotentiary at <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> and afterwards his drudging Sham-plot Secretary. It was his being a zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> that preferr'd the Lord <hi>Clifford</hi> to the Treasurers Staff, with several others of the same stamp to other high Preferments, more Eminent for their Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties than for their Parts; and lastly, what was it but this Indulgence, and finding ways to dismiss the Papists without any harm or damage when Indicted or Presented at the Sessions, that advanced so many <hi>Beneplacito</hi> Judges, and continued them in their Places.</p>
            <p>I had almost forgot another very great kindness which the same Parliament did him; which was at the Private Instance of the King, to abrogate the <hi>Triennial Act,</hi> by which the sitting of Parliaments once in three years was infallibly secur'd to the Kingdom. So well did his Majesty know where the Shoe pinch'd him; and so craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was he to take his Advantage from the Delirium and Frenzy the Nation was in upon his Restoration, to obtain the repeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Principal Laws by which his wriggling into Arbitrary Government would have been curb'd and restrain'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:62803:21"/>But whether it were that the Prodigal Zeal of those Members began to cool, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious perhaps that they had already open'd too large a Gap to Tyrannous Invasion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Liberties of the People, which they had so treacherously laid at the Kings Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; or whether it were that the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd to quicken his pace to Arbitrary Rule, to the end he might see Popery flourish in his own Days, certain it is that his next At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt was to make the Parliaments them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the Ministers and Instruments of his own Popish Ambition, and our Slavery. In order hereunto he falls a buying and purchasing, at certain and annual Rates, the Votes of the Members; at what time the greatness of the number of those who stood ready for Sale, as well as their Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies and Lusts, made the Price at which they were to be bought so much the easier. Now being thus hir'd by his Majesty, with their own free Offerings of the Nations Money; How many Bills did they pass in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Acts for enslaving and ruining a third part of the Kingdom, under the Notion of <hi>Phanaticks</hi> and <hi>Dissenters,</hi> and all this in gratitude for their Sallaries, and to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish the Will and Pleasure of their Lord and Master the King, whose bought and purchas'd Vassals and Slaves they were?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:62803:21"/>All this while what can we say or think other, but that the Purchaser as well as the Sellers were equally guilty of betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the People who had entrusted them? And then to make a President by Law for Tyranny, those <hi>Hirelings</hi> empower'd the <hi>Iustices</hi> of the <hi>Peace</hi> to disseize Men of their Estates, without being convicted and found guilty by Legal Juries, of the Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions whereof they stood accus'd: By which they not only overthrew all the Common and Statute Law of the Land, but they sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and altered the Fundamental Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, in making <hi>English</hi> Men liable to be ruin'd at the Arbitrary Pleasure of the King. And as an addition to this, those Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Members, by the Orders and Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of their most Pious and Protestant Paymaster the King, past another Law, which was stiled the Act for Corporations, by which Men of Principles and Integrity were debarred all Offices of Magistracy in Cities and Corporate Towns. The wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Effects of which the Kingdom not long after both saw and felt, in the Surrenders of Charters, and betraying of Franchises, by Persons upon whom the Government of the Corporations came to be devolv'd by Vertue of that Act. For that had it not been for that Act which excluded so many
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62803:22"/>
honest, able, and vertuous Men, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons whom the King for his by-ends no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated for fit and loyal Men, would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have risen above the Office of Scaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, or Headboroughs, or Constables at the highest. To this, as a thing that main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contributed to the King's design of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaving us, we may subjoyn their passing an Act whereby they did both limit and confine the number of those that were to present Petitions to the King, not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed Ten Persons. Let the Matter to be represented be ne're so important, or the Grievance to be redress'd never so illegal and oppressive, yet it was made no less then a Riot, if above Ten Persons ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress'd themselves to the King to crave the Benefit of the Law. A Trouble which the King carefully provided against, knowing how many Laws he had to break, and how burthensom and oppressive he must be to the People, before he could compleat the Fabrick of Slavery and Popery which he was erecting.</p>
            <p>Nor was this all; for the King strenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously pursuing his Design of being sincere and cordial to the destruction of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, had so bephilter'd them with his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Aurum Potabile,</hi> that they pass'd another Act to his Hearts desire, whereby
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62803:22"/>
they plac'd <hi>the whole and sole Power of the Militia in the King:</hi> not only encouraging him to use Force in compassing his Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Designs, but binding up the Hands of the People from defending themselves against armed Violence upon their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, Liberties, and Lives. Add to this the vast sums which they gave him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what the Support of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or the Defence of the Nation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd: Which might have produc'd fatal Consequences, but that the King knew as little a Measure in spending, as that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Parliament did in giving. The King therefore conscious of his own Failing, and finding that through his own Wast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, and the Importunities of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming Misses, he could not depend upon any limited and definite Sum for accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishing his Promises to his Holy Father the Pope, and his trusty Confederate the <hi>French</hi> King, got Two Bills prepar'd and carry'd into the House, the Passing of which had compleated the Nations Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and made him Absolute. The one was <hi>to empower his Majesty upon Extraordinary Occasions</hi> (of which he would not have fail'd to have been the Judge as often as he pleas'd) <hi>to raise Money without a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> And the other was, <hi>for setling a
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62803:23"/>
Universal Excise upon the Crown.</hi> The Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing either of which, the King well knew would have soon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nabl'd him to have go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd by <hi>Basha's</hi> and <hi>Ianizaries,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem'd him from having any further need of Parliaments, or any apprehension of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Instruments of his Tyranny im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach'd by Them.</p>
            <p>But what the King had so finely proje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to enslave the Nation, and obtain whatever he had a mind to, prov'd the Ground of their Disappointment, and the Occasion of the Nations Escape from the Snare that was laid for it. For the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary Members foreseeing that the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing these Bills would have put an end to their Pensions, by rendring them useless for the time to come, consulted their Gain, and preferring it above what the Court styl'd their Loyalty, fell in with the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Party, and so became assistant in throwing out the Bills. However, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bringing the Bills into the House, was as clear an Evidence of the King's Intention to alter the Government, and enslave the Nation, as if they had pass'd into Laws. And some of his Minions, that knew the King's Drift, and the inside of his Heart, were so zealous for him to have gain'd this Arbitrary Power, that they would have it
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62803:23"/>
argu'd and spoken to in the House of Lords. And who but the Popish Lord <hi>Clifford</hi> should be the Man that ventur'd to undertake the Business? And accordingly, he made a long Harrangue in praise of Absolute Monarchy, and how much it would be for the Interest of the Kingdom to have his Majesty entrusted with a more unlimited Authority. Which some of the Lords resenting, with a Warmth and Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation becoming Persons, who by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions of the Governmeut were design'd for a Bulwark against the Encroachments of Regal Power, and as a Fence about the Liberties of the People, the Motion not only dy'd without being seconded, but <hi>Clifford,</hi> even by him who had encourag'd him in his Attempt, was call'd a rash Fool for his pains. However, Pious <hi>AEneas</hi> find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Nation grew sensible of his covert Intentions and Encroachments upon their Laws and Liberties, and despairing to get any more Acts pass'd in Parliament to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the promoting his Designs, resolv'd to husband the Laws he had already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, as much as he could, to the Ruine of the Nation; and where they fail'd of being serviceable to his Ends, to betake himself to other Methods and Means. And therefore, besides the daily impoverishing,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:62803:24"/>
confining, and destroying of infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of honest and peaceable People, under pretence of executing the Laws, he made it his Business to invent new Projects to tear up the Rights and Liberties of the People, by ways and means which had not the least shadow of a Law to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance them; of which more in due place.</p>
            <p>Having made this fair Progress toward the enslaving both the Souls and Bodies of his own Subjects at home, let us take a View of his Zeal to the Protestant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on abroad. And first, for the Protestants of <hi>France,</hi> his Care and Tenderness for them may be easily conjectur'd from hence, that the first Edicts issu'd forth by <hi>Lewis</hi> the Fourteenth for their Persecution, bear date with the Time and Year of his Most Protestant Majesties Restauration. And from that day to this, in stead of interce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or concerning himself in their behalf, he has, by his own Example, and his strict Correspondence with the <hi>French</hi> King, both countenanc'd and encourag'd their Oppression; which the <hi>French</hi> King at that time, when he was formidable in the Love of his Subjects, durst no more have prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, than <hi>Mazarine</hi> durst proceed in his Fury against the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> when more Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Oliver</hi> bestir'd himself in their Favour.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62803:24"/>
But our Protestant Monarch was so far from sending Succour to the <hi>French</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, that he betray'd those to the Rage of the <hi>French</hi> Tyrant, that came to invoke his Aid in their behalf.</p>
            <p>For when Monsieur <hi>Rohan</hi> came into <hi>England,</hi> to acquaint his Pious Majesty with the Resolutions taken at <hi>Paris,</hi> to persecute, and if possible, to root out the <hi>Reformed</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and propos'd such Overtures to the King as would have been greatly for his Glory and Interest, yet no way contrary to the Allegiance of that poor People, he remitted the <hi>Monsieur</hi> to his Brother the D. of <hi>York,</hi> who not only inform'd the <hi>French</hi> Embassador of the Gentleman's Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand, but plac'd him behind the Hangings, to hear whatever Monsieur <hi>Rohan</hi> had to represent and propose to him. Which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho the Embassador could not but abhor in the two Brothers, and was asham'd of in himself, yet he could do no less then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his Master of what he had seen and heard. Upon which the poor Gentleman, upon his Return out of <hi>England,</hi> was so narrowly watch'd, and so closely pursu'd, that being apprehended upon the Borders of <hi>Switzerland,</hi> he was carried back to <hi>Paris</hi> and there broken upon the Wheel.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:62803:25"/>Nor did it satisfie the King, and his dear Brother the Duke, to have thus betray'd as well as abandon'd the Protestants in <hi>France</hi>; but with the utmost Malice that Popery could inspire into them, they sought the Destruction of the Seven <hi>United Provinces,</hi> upon no other Account but of their being Protestant States, and for gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving shelter to those who being persecuted by himself and his Confederate the <hi>French</hi> Tyrant for their Religion, fled thither for Protection and Safety. For knowing what in due time they intended to bring upon the Protestants at home, they thought it most requisite to destroy those Protestant States in the first place, that there might remain no Sanctuary for their persecuted Subjects. And indeed, abating this and one more Ground of their Quarrel with those States, never was a War undertaken upon more unjust and frivolous Pretences, then those Two which the King engag'd in against the <hi>Seven Provinces,</hi> in the Years 1667. and 1672. Nor can any thing ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie the Discretion and Wisdom of those Wars, had they not been undertaken meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in subserviency to the promoting Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery and Slavery; seeing that upon all other Grounds that Reason and Prudence can suggest, it was the Interest of <hi>England,</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:62803:25"/>
as still it is, to preserve the Government of <hi>Holland</hi> entire. Nor can we have a truer Accompt of the Grounds upon which the two Monarchs of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> agreed the War against <hi>Holland</hi> in the Year 1672. then by the Representation which the <hi>French</hi> Embassador made of it both at <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Vienna.</hi> For tho' his Publick Declaration pretended no more but that it was <hi>to seek Reparation for the Diminution of his Glory,</hi> yet the Accompt he gave to the Pope of his Master's, and consequently of our Protestant Monarch, his strict Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate's undertaking that War, was, that he did it <hi>in order to the Extirpation of Heresie.</hi> And in the same manner they sought to justifie the Piety of that Enterprise to his Imperial Majesty, by alledging, <hi>That the</hi> Hollanders <hi>were a People that had forsaken God, and were Hereticks, and that all good Christians were bound to associate and unite for their Extirpation.</hi> Upon which accompt, it seems, our King and the Duke thought fit to exchange the Appellation of <hi>Good Protestants</hi> for that of <hi>Good Christians.</hi> However, from hence it was plain what sort of <hi>Good Christians</hi> they were, since it was as evident, that their uniting with <hi>France</hi> in that War, was to destroy the <hi>Protestant Dutch Hereticks.</hi> And that we
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:62803:26"/>
may yet more fully understand the Motive upon which the King embark't in that bloody and expensive War, it is worthy observation, how that when the <hi>French</hi> King made it one of his Propositions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he would be contented to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the States into his ancient Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, That they should not only allow the Publick Exercise of the Roman Catholick Religion over all the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> but that they should appoint a Sallary to the Priest allotted to the Churches which the Papists by that Demand were to enjoy; the King of <hi>England</hi> being no less concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Popery then his Brother of <hi>France,</hi> gave the States to understand by his Pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potentiaries, That without their Concessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the foregoing Demand of the King of <hi>France,</hi> he could not return to Peace with them. So that not only from the Motive upon which the War was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menc'd, but from the Proposals which he urg'd them to consent to, in order to a Peace, we have a most convincing Proof of his Majesty's being no zealous Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, but rather quite the contrary; and of his pious Inclinations to the Extirpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as well as weakning the Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in the <hi>United Provinces.</hi> Certainly a most thankful Acknowledgment, and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:62803:26"/>
Royal Requital of those <hi>Provinces,</hi> for the many Kindnesses which they had vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saf'd him during his Exile, and for their Favours, their liberal Entertainments &amp; the high Honours which they had paid him, when he made their Country the last Stage of his Retreat, in order to his Return to his Crown and Kingdom. But this must be ascrib'd to his Zeal for promoting the Catholick Religion, which attones for all Defects of Justice and Gratitude, and ought to be imputed to those Principles of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which he had suck't in with the <hi>French</hi> Air, and which have a peculiar Vertue and Faculty to expel all Morality and good Nature.</p>
            <p>These being the real Grounds and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives that induc'd the King of <hi>England</hi> to begin that Impolitick War against the <hi>Dutch</hi> in the year 1665. whatever was openly and publickly pretended, how strangely was the Parliament deluded and blinded by the King's Oaths and Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his Zeal for the Protestant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion! What vast Sums of the Subjects Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney they gave the perfidious Monarch, to defray the Expences of that unnecessary and baneful War, is too well known; and yet after all, saving one brisk Engagement, ill-manag'd, tho' with some Loss to the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:62803:27"/>
               <hi>Dutch,</hi> at length no Fleet was set out, and the choicest of the Royal Navy either burnt or taken in Harbour, to save Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. And tho' the <hi>French</hi> at length join'd themselves in assistance with the <hi>Dutch</hi> against us, yet by the Credit he had with the Queen Mother, he so far impos'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, no less ready for his own private Conveniencies to be impos'd upon, that upon assurance, which no Man of Prudence and Foresight would have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> would have no Fleet at Sea that Year, he forbore to make rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and so incurr'd that ignominious Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace at <hi>Chatham,</hi> the like to which the <hi>English</hi> never suffer'd since they claim'd the Dominion of the Sea. And which was more, as he had been beholden to his great Friend the King of <hi>France</hi> for the Ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny he had suffer'd, so was he glad to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Peace from his Favour, which was concluded at <hi>Breda.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now we come to the best Act that ever he did in his Life, had he had the Grace to pursue it; which shew'd how happy a Prince he might have been, had he been ever faithful to his own and the Interests of his People, and that Religion which he outwardly profest.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:62803:27"/>For upon conclusion of that Peace, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving leisure to look about him, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve how the <hi>French</hi> had in the Year 1667. taken their Opportunity, and while we were embroyl'd and weakned by the late War, had, in violation of all the most Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and Solemn Oaths and Treaties, inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and taken a great part of the <hi>Spanish Netherlands,</hi> which had always been consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd as the Natural Frontier of <hi>England</hi>; the King then prompted more by his own Fears, then out of any kindness he had for the Nation, judg'd it necessary to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, before the Flames that consum'd his next Neighbour should throw their Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles over the Water.</p>
            <p>Thereupon he sent Sir <hi>William Temple,</hi> then his Resident at <hi>Brussels,</hi> to propose a nearer <hi>Alliance</hi> with the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and to take joint Measures against the <hi>French:</hi> Which Proposals of Sir <hi>William Temple</hi>'s being entertain'd with all Compliance with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> within Five days after Two several Treaties were concluded between the King and the States: The one, a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive and Stricter League than before, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Two Nations; and the other, a Joint and Reciprocal Engagement to oppose the Conquest of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and to procure, either by way of Mediation, or
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62803:28"/>
by Force of Arms, a speedy Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> upon the Terms therein mentioned. And because <hi>Sweden</hi> came into the same Treaty within a very little while after, from the Three Parties concern'd and engag'd, it was call'd the <hi>Triple League.</hi> In pursuance of which, the Treaty of <hi>Aix la Chapelle</hi> was also forc'd upon the <hi>French,</hi> and in some manner up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who were very unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to part with so great a Part of their Country by a Solemn Treaty. But both the King and the <hi>Hollanders</hi> thought it a very great and good Work, and judg'd it an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Happiness, not only for <hi>Spain,</hi> but for all <hi>Europe,</hi> to come off with a broken Pate, and to have at least for that while kept <hi>France</hi> from going farther.</p>
            <p>Besides all this, to tye the Knot the faster, and take even the very thoughts from the <hi>French</hi> King of ever stirring, or being troublesom to his Neighbour, the King sent an Extraordinary Envoy to several Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> to invite them into the Triple League, and his Minister to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade them to it, laid open with no less heat then plainness, the danger all Europe was in; urging the insensibility of most Princes, and their carelesness, the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Ambition of the <hi>French,</hi> the Greatness
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62803:28"/>
of their Forces, and the little Reason there was to trust him. In fine, omitting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that could Alarm all the World, and procure a general Confederacy against the Common Oppressor. More than this, in regard the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were very much wanting to themselves, by their backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the Payment of the Subsidies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to <hi>Sweden</hi>; the King af <hi>England,</hi> being not without some fears, least the <hi>Swedes</hi> should fall off, uless the Money agreed upon, were paid them without farther delay; he offer'd to advance part of it himself, and had accordingly done it, in case the <hi>Dutch</hi> would have advanced the rest.</p>
            <p>The Kidg of <hi>France</hi> thus stopp'd in his Career by the Tripple League, and by the Peace of <hi>Aix la Chapelle,</hi> soon after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, though for a while he dissembled his dissatisfaction, yet resolved to untye the Tripple Knot whatever it cost him. To which purpose the Dutchess of <hi>Orleans</hi> was sent over, as one that would be a welcom Guest to her Brother, and whose Charms <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

all the King's good Councils, and by yielding to his Incestuous Embraces, while the D. of <hi>B.</hi> held the Door, so charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his most Sacred Majesty, and he quite and clean forgot his Tripple League, and entred into a new and stricter Alliance with <hi>France</hi> than ever. 'Tis true, the Peace was dear bought by the Zealous Lady, in regard it cost her her Life upon her return into <hi>France.</hi> For though she might seem to have atton'd for the Crime, and to have merited forgiveness from her Husband, by the advantageous League which she had pleasantly <hi>syren'd</hi> her Brother to make with the French Monarch; yet jealous and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed <hi>Orleance</hi> was not so much a lover of his Country, as to remit the Indignity done to his Bed, or such a Bigot as to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the Woman that had sacrificed his Honour to the Interest of Popery. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Articles being thus sealed at <hi>Dover</hi> by his Majesty, the Marquis of <hi>Belfonds</hi> was immediately sent hither, and a Person of great Honour sent thither, and so the League it self being drawn into form, was ratified on both sides.</p>

However the Book being Printed, some few Copies lit into safe hands; from whence take the Substance of that Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Iniquity as follows.</p>
            <q>
               <p>After that M. <hi>de Croisy,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador at <hi>London,</hi> had laid before the Eyes of the King of <hi>England,</hi> all the Grounds which his Majesty had of Complaint against <hi>Holland,</hi> &amp;c. He told him, that the time was come to revenge himself of a Nation that had so little respect for Kings; and that the occasion was never more favourable, seeing many of the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> were already entered into the League; and that the King of <hi>France</hi> was powerful enough to be able to promise to his Allies in the Issue of that War satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, both as to their Honour and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests, whereby he prevailed with that Prince
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62803:30"/>
to enter into secret Alliance with <hi>France.</hi> And for his greater Assurance, and the more to confirm him, <hi>Henrietta</hi> Dutchess of <hi>Orleans</hi> went for <hi>England,</hi> and proposed to her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the Name of the Most Christian King, that he would assure him an Absolute Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over his Parliament, and full Power to establish the Catholick Religion in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> But withal she told him, that to compass this, before all things else, it would be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to abate the Pride and Power of the Dutch, and to reduce them to the sole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Holland;</hi> and that by this means the King of <hi>England</hi> should have <hi>Zealand</hi> for a Retreat in case of necessity, and that the rest of the Low-Countries should remain to the King of <hi>France,</hi> if he could render himself Master of it.</p>
            </q>
            <p>This is the Sum of that famous League concluded at <hi>Dover,</hi> fram'd and enter'd into on purpose, for the Subjugation of these three Nations to Popery and Slavery.</p>
            <p>However as at first this Treaty was kept so close, that it was no way to be discover'd, so before the Effects appear'd, it was necessary that the Parliament, after the old wont, should be gull'd to the giving of Money,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:62803:30"/>
for the carrying on this grand and deep Conspiracy. The Parliament met <hi>Octob.</hi> 24. 1670. where the Lord Keeper <hi>Bridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> guided more by his Instructions than by any knowledge he had of the devilish Design, omitted nothing to make Both Houses sensible of the great Service done to <hi>England,</hi> and in a manner to all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, by chaining up the devouring Lyon, that was never satiated with Prey; and the more to incite their Liberality, he told them of several other Leagues, which the King, for the good of his People, and the Advancement of the Trade of the Nation, had made with other Princes; as the D. of <hi>Savoy,</hi> the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and the King of <hi>Spain</hi>; by which, as his Lordship was pleased to say, it was evident, that all the Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> sought his Majesties Friendship, as acknowledging they could not secure, much less improve, their present Condition without it; concluding, that for the Support of these Alliances, the annual Charge of His Majesties Navy, came to no less than Five hundred thousand Pounds, nor could be maintain'd with less.</p>
            <p>Upon the telling of which Story, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the immense Sums lavish'd to no purpose, or rather to our Loss, in the former War with <hi>Holland</hi>; notwithstanding
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:62803:31"/>
they had given the <hi>Additional</hi> Duty upon Wines for Eight years, amounting to Five hundred and sixty thousand Pounds, and confirmed the Sale of the <hi>Fee farm Rents,</hi> no less their Gift, being a part of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Revenue, to the value of one Million, and Eight hundred thousand Pounds, they could not hold, but gave with both hands again a Subsidy of Twelve Pence in the Pound to the real value of all Lands, and other Estates proportionably, with several more beneficial Clauses in the Bargain; to which they joyned the Additional Excise upon Beer, Ale, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And lastly the <hi>Law Bill,</hi> which being summ'd up together, could not be estimated at less than two Millions and half.</p>
            <p>So that for the Tripple League here was a Tripple Supply, and the Subject had now all the reason to believe, that this Alliance which had been fix'd at first by the Publick Interest, Safety and Honour, was by these three Grants, as with three <hi>Golden Nails,</hi> sufficiently clinched and rivetted. But now therefore was the most proper Time and Occasion, for the King and his chosen Ministers to give Demonstrations of their Fidelity to the <hi>French Monarch,</hi> and for his Sacred Majesty by the Forfeiture of all these Obligations to his Subjects, and the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:62803:31"/>
Princes abroad, and at the Expence of all this Treasure, given for quite contrary Uses, to recommend himself the more meritoriously to his Patronage.</p>
            <p>The Parliament, therefore, after they had given all this Money, were presently Prorogued, and sat no more till the latter end of <hi>February,</hi> 1672. that there might be a competent time allowed, for so great a work as was designed, and that the Architects of our Ruine might be so long free from the busie and odious Inspection of the Parliament, till the work were finish'd. And now all Applications made by his Majesty of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> to induce Foreign Princes into the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty of the Peace of <hi>Aix la Chapelle,</hi> ceased; while on the other side, those who desired to be admitted into it, were here rejected. The Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> who had always been a true Friend to the King, and for his Affection to the <hi>Tripple League,</hi> had incurred the <hi>French</hi> King's Displeasure with the loss of his Country, Seizd upon in the year 1669. against all the Laws not only of Peace, but Hostility; yet by vertue of the <hi>Dover</hi> Treaty, was refused the favour to which others had been so earnestly invited; and though his <hi>Envoy</hi> was sent back with
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:62803:32"/>
Complements and many Expressions of Kindness, yet he was told withal, that the French Invasion was a torrent not to be stopp'd at that time: which was as much as to say, the Case was alter'd and the Tripple League must signifie nothing.</p>
            <p>At the same time also the Emperour, by a Letter, invited himself into the same Garranty, in conformity to one of the Articles of the said Treaty of <hi>Aix.</hi> Upon receipt of which Letter, the King assured the Spanish Embassador, that he was glad his Imperial Majesty was so ready to come into the League, and told him, he would cause an Instrument to be prepared in order to his Admission. But when the Resolution was taken, and orders given for preparing the said Instrument, it was moved, that Mr. Secretary <hi>Trevor,</hi> (who was not initiated in their holy Mysteries) might not have the drawing of it, though it was his proper Province. By which means the Popish Cabal having made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves sole Masters of the thing, at first a reasonable honest Draught was brought in; but before it was perfected, Monsieur <hi>Colbert</hi> being consulted, the King was possessed with an opinion, that the admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Emperor would be attended with dangerous Consequences, and that in
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:62803:32"/>
case he came into the League, his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty would be engaged in all his Quarrels, and bound to make his Forces March into the farthest parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> as often as it should happen to be Invaded by the <hi>Great Turk</hi>; which Secretary <hi>Trevor</hi> oppos'd as much as he was able, and endeavoured to satisfie the King, that the Garranty of the Tripple League, as well as of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Aix,</hi> related only to Hostilities, either from <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spain</hi>; yet the wary Men of the Cabal being on the King's side, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd it, and so the Emperor was put off with a Flamm.</p>
            <p>Nay, so soon as the Two Confederate Monarchs had thus made a shift to cut the Gordian Knot, the now pitiful, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly vaunted <hi>Tripple League,</hi> was trampled under foot, turn'd into <hi>Ridicule,</hi> and less valued than a Ballad. Insomuch, that to talk of admitting others into the <hi>Tripple League,</hi> was reprehended in print as a kind of Figure of Speech, commonly called a <hi>Bull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And farther, to shew how much he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the thoughts of the <hi>Triple League,</hi> which he had made for the good of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, his most Sacred Majesty suffered an Agent of his, one <hi>Marsilly,</hi> whom he had sent to invite the <hi>Switzers</hi> into the Garran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:62803:33"/>
who was Surprized and taken Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner by the <hi>French,</hi> in the execution of the Commands he had not many Months before received from <hi>Whitehall,</hi> to be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken upon the <hi>Wheel</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> tho one single Word from the King would have sav'd his Life. Neither did he take it ill, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Scaffold, Twenty Questions were put to him relating to his own Person: or that in such a publick and infamous Place, a strict inquiry should be made as to what had pass'd between him and the King of <hi>England</hi>; for that was the best Title they could afford him for all his late Favours.</p>
            <p>And thus it is plain, that the Tripple League was broken, for no other ends than to be subservient to the ends of the <hi>French</hi> King, to ruin the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and to bring the Three Kindoms of <hi>England, Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> under the Yoaks of Arbitrary Power and <hi>Roman Catholick Idolatry,</hi> after a total Abolition of the name of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and subversion of the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Laws, <hi>Gratias tibi piissime atque invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctissime Rex, Carole Secunde.</hi> And tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> he might not, as much as in him lay, meet with after-rubs, Mr. <hi>H. C.</hi> dispatch'd into <hi>Sweden</hi> to dissolve the Tripple League in that Kingdom; which he did so effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:62803:33"/>
by co-operating with the <hi>French</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters in that Court, that the <hi>Swede</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it came to Rupture, never assisted to any purpose, or prosecuted the Ends of the said Alliance, only by arming him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self at the expence of the League, first under a disguised Mediation, acted the <hi>French</hi> Interest, and at last threw off his Vizard, and drew his Sword on the <hi>French</hi> side in the Quarrel. And at home, when the Project ripen'd and grew hopeful, the Lord Keeper was discharged from his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and both he, the D. of <hi>Ormond,</hi> Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> and Secretary <hi>Trevor,</hi> were discar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded out of the Committee for Forreign Affairs, as being too honest to comply with the Intreagues then on foot: Mr. <hi>Trevor</hi> being the first Secretary of State that was ever left out of a Commission of that Importance.</p>
            <p>All things being so well thus far dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed toward a War with <hi>Holland,</hi> there wanted only a Quarrel, and to pick one required much invention. The <hi>East-India</hi> Company was summon'd to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they had any thing to object against them: but the <hi>Dutch</hi> had so punctually complyed with all the Conditions of the Peace at <hi>Breda,</hi> that nothing could there be found out. And as to the Tripple
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:62803:34"/>
League, they were out at the same time in pursuance of it, and to be ready upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to relieve the the <hi>Spanish Netherlands,</hi> which were then threatned by the <hi>French.</hi> But at length a way was found out that never hapned, because it was never so much as imagin'd before, by sending the <hi>Fanfan,</hi> a sorry inconsiderable Yatcht, but bearing the <hi>English</hi> Flag, with Orders to sail into the middle of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet, single out the Admiral, and to fire two Guns at him; a thing as ridiculous, as for a Lark to dare a Hobby.</p>
            <p>However, the Commander in Chief, in respect to his Majesties Colours, and in consideration of the Amity between both Nations, paid the Admiral of the <hi>Yatcht</hi> a Visit, to know the reason of his Anger; and understanding it was because the whole Fleet had fail'd to strike to his Oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-boat; the <hi>Dutch</hi> Commander excus'd it, as a thing that never hapned before, and therefore could have no Instructions in it; and so they parted. But the Captain of the Yatcht having thus acquitted himself, return'd full freighted, with the Quarrel he was sent for. Which yet for several Months was pass'd over here in silence, but to be afterwards improv'd as the design ripen'd:
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:62803:34"/>
For there was yet one jolly prank more to be plaid at home, to make the King more capable of what was shortly after to be executed upon his Neighbours.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Exchequer</hi> for some years before, by the Bait of more than ordinary Gain, had decoy'd in the greatest part of the most wealthy <hi>Goldsmiths,</hi> and they the rest of the Money'd People of the Nation, by the due payment of Interest, till the King was run in Debt, upon what account no body knew, above Two Millions: Which served for one of the Pretences in the <hi>Lord Keeper</hi>'s Speech at the Opening of the Parliament, to demand and obtain a Grant of the forementioned Supplies, and might plentifully have suffic'd to disengage the King with Peace and any tolerable Good Husbandry. But as if it had been perfidious to have apply'd them to any of the Purposes declar'd, instead of Payment, it was privately resolv'd to shut up the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> lest any part of the Money should have been legally expended, but that all might be appropriated to the Holy War in prospect, and those far more pious Uses to which the King had dedicated it.</p>
            <p>This Affair was carried on with all the secresie imaginable, lest the unseasonable venting of it should have spoil'd the Wit
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:62803:35"/>
and Malice of the Design. So that all on a sudden, upon the First of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1671. to the great astonishment, ruine, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair of so many interested Persons, and to the Terror of the whole Nation, by so Arbitrary a Fact, the Proclamation issu'd forth, in the midst of the Confluence of such vast Aids and so great a Revenue, whereby the Crown publish'd it self Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, made Prize of the Subject, and broke all Faith and Contract at home, in order to the breaking of both abroad with more advantage.</p>
            <p>What was this but a Robbery commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon the People under the Bond and Security of the Royal Faith? by which many hundreds were as really impoverish'd and undone, as if he had violently broken into their Houses, and taken their Money out of their Coffers. Nay, that would have look'd Generous and Great, whereas the other was base and sneaking. Only it seem'd more agreeable to his Majesties Temper, to rob his Subjects by a Trick, than to plunder them by direct and open Force.</p>
            <p>Of alliance to this, only with some more G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ains, if more could be, of Vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Unworthiness in it, was that Action also, of seizing part of the Money
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:62803:35"/>
collected for the Redemption of Slaves out of <hi>Argiers,</hi> and fetching it from the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>London,</hi> where it lay deposited to that end, into the Treasury, from whence it was to be dispos'd and made use of for the Enslaving the Nation. Could there be an Action of greater barbarity, than to take the Charity and Benevolence of good People, which had been given toward the Releasing of poor <hi>Christian</hi> Captives from <hi>Mahometan</hi> Thraldom, and to turn it either into Wages for his <hi>Myrmidons,</hi> or into Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions to reward suborn'd Witnesses for swearing the Innocent out of their Lives?</p>
            <p>There remain'd nothing now, but that the King, after this famous Exploit upon his own Subjects, should manifest his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiality to Forreigners, and assert the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of his intended Quarrel with the <hi>Hollanders.</hi> Thereupon the Dispute about the Flag, upon occasion of the <hi>Fanfan Yacht,</hi> was started afresh; and a great noise was made of infamous <hi>Libels,</hi> horrid <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, Pillars</hi> set up, and <hi>Medals</hi> coin'd to the infinite dishonour of his Majesties Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, his Crown and Dignity; tho' not one of those Libels or Pictures could be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced; and as for the <hi>Pillars,</hi> they never had any Being, but in the Imaginations of those that made it their Business to raise
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:62803:36"/>
Jealousies between the two Nations. 'Tis true, there was a Medal coin'd, which might have been spar'd; but so soon as it was known in <hi>Holland</hi> that Exceptions were taken at it, the Stamp was broken to pieces.</p>
            <p>Then the Difficulties which arose about the Surrender of <hi>Surinam</hi> were improv'd to the height, and this after Secretary <hi>Trevor</hi> had adjusted the Matter with the States. Though these things were handl'd so nicely, as if they had been afraid of being prevented in their design, by receiving all the satisfaction they could have desired from the <hi>Dutch.</hi> The <hi>Dutch</hi> therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not conscious of any Provocation which they had given the <hi>English,</hi> but of their readiness, if there had been any, to repair it, and relying upon the Faith of the Kings Treaties and Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, pursu'd their Traffick and Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion through the <hi>English</hi> Seas without the least suspicion. And accordingly a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous and rich Fleet of Merchant-men from <hi>Smyrna</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> were on their Voyage homeward near the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> under a small Convoy of five or six Men of War. This was the Fleet, in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which the King had so long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd the War to plunder them in Peace.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:62803:36"/>
The Wealth of this was that, which by its ponderous weight, turn'd the Ballance of all his Publick Justice and Honour. With this Treasure he imagined he should be in stock for all the Wickdness he was capable to act, and that he should never after this Addition stand himself in need, nor his Instruments in fear of a Parliament. To this purpose Sir <hi>R. H.</hi> being pitch'd upon for the Exploit, according to his Instructions, fell in among them, with the Squadron under his Command: But the Dutch Merchant-men themselves, and their small Convoy, so bestir'd themselves, that Sir <hi>Robert</hi> finding himself not strong enough, was forced to give over the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize; So that all the Booty that was got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten hardly sufficed to pay the Surgeons and Carpenters.</p>
            <p>And so hotly did the King pursue his Chase of the Protestant Religion, that while he was so piously and justly Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating his Royal Contracts upon the Sea, in order to his mastering the Protestant Religion abroad, he at the same time was undermining and sapping it at home. For while he was trying his Fortune in Battel with the <hi>Smyrna</hi> Fleet, a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Liberty of Conscience was Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off at the Press, as a more proper
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:62803:37"/>
means than Fasting and Prayer, to propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate for Success to his Enterprize, and to the War that must second it.</p>
            <p>By this Declaration, all the Penal Laws against Papists, for which former Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments had given so many vast Sums, were in one Instant suspended, in order to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud the Nation of all that Religion which they had so dearly purchas'd, and for which they ought at least, the Bargain being broken, to have been reimburs'd.</p>
            <p>By all which, it was plain that the King did all that lay in his power toward the advancement of Popery and Slavery, but that still his luck was nought. For, having been thus true to his great Design, and made so considerable a Progress, though with an inauspicious beginning, at length he thought it high time to declare the War, after he had begun it. And though in subservience to <hi>France</hi> and his <hi>Dover</hi> T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he undertook to be formost to discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the State of all Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>istendom; and though he made himself Principal to all the horrid Destructions, Devastati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Ravage and Slaughter, which after that ensued, yet had he the Confidence, in the winding up of his <hi>Manifesto,</hi> to expose the following Words to the World.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:62803:37"/>
               <p>And whereas we are engaged by a Treaty, to support the Peace made at <hi>Aix la Chapelle,</hi> We do finally declare, That notwithstanding the Prosecution of this War, we will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the true intent and Scope of the said Treaty; and that in all Alliances which We have, or shall make in the Progress of this War, We have and will take care to preserve the ends thereof inviolable, unless provoked to the contrary.</p>
            </q>
            <p>And yet it was as clear as the Sun, that the <hi>French</hi> had by the Treaty of <hi>Aix la Chapelle,</hi> agreed to acquiesce in their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Conquests of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and that the <hi>English Swedes</hi> and <hi>Hollanders,</hi> were reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procally bound to be aiding against whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever should disturb that Regulation: Besides the League Offensive and Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive, which the King had made with the States General; all which by this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with <hi>France,</hi> was dash'd in pieces. So that what is here declared, were it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consilable to Truth, yet could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist with possibility, unless by one only Exception, that the <hi>English,</hi> who by their new league with <hi>France,</hi> were to be the Breakers of the Peace of <hi>Aix,</hi> and by the <hi>Tripple League,</hi> were to fulfil their Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to both Parties, should have
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:62803:38"/>
sheath'd the Sword in our own Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els.</p>
            <p>But such was the Zeal of the King and his select Instrument, for the Promotion of Slavery and Popery, that it easily tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sported them to say what was untrue, or to undertake what was impossible, for the Service of the French.</p>
            <p>And now the French King seeing the English engaged past all retreat, comes in with his Fleet; not to fight, but only to sound our Seas, to spy our Ports, to learn our Building, to learn our way of Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and to consume ours, and preserve his own Navy. For no sooner had the D. of <hi>York,</hi> as the design was laid, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered himself to be shamefully surprized, but the Vice-Admiral, the Earl of <hi>Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi> was sacrificed, and the rest of the English Fleet so torn and mangled, that the English Honour was laid not in the Dust, but in the Mud, while his <hi>Royal Highness</hi> did all that was expected from him, and <hi>M. d'Estrees,</hi> who commanded the French, did all that he was sent for.</p>
            <p>There were three other several Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ours with the Dutch the next Summer. But while nothing was tenable at Land against the French, so it seemed, that to the English every thing was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:62803:38"/>
at Sea, which was not to be attributed to the want of Courage or Conduct of the then Commanders, but rather to the unlucky Conjunction of the English with the French, like the Disasters that happen to Men by being in ill Company.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the hopes of the <hi>Spanish</hi> and <hi>Smirna</hi> Fleet being vanished, the slender Allowance from the French not sufficing to defray farther Charges, and the ordinary Revenue of His Majesty, with all the former Aids, being in less than one years time exhausted; the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with the King's most gracious leave, was permitted to sit again at the time appointed. At what time, at the King's and the Lord Keeper's usual daubing way, the War was first communicated to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Causes, the Necessity, the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger so well painted out, that upon the King's earnest Suit, the Commons, though in a War begun without their Advice, readily Voted the Royal Mumper no less than One million two hundred and fifty thousand Pounds; though they would not say it was for the War, but for the King's extraordinary Occasions.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless it was but yet a Vote to <hi>Embryo</hi>; and therefore now beginning in
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:62803:39"/>
grow more sensible of the true Causes of the Quarrel they prepared an Act before they let the Money-Bill slip out of their Hands, by which the Papists were obliged to pass through a new State Purgatory, if they intended to be capable of any Publick Employment.</p>
            <p>The Declaration also of Indulgence was questioned, which tho His Majesty had, out of his Princely and Gracious Inclinations to Popery, and the Memory of some former Obligations, granted for the sake of the Papists, yet greedy after the Coin, he was pleased to cancel at the humble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest. as he pretended, of the Parliament, and declared, it should be no President for the future: After which compelled by his want of a fresh Supply, he passed the Bill concerning the Papists, in exchange for the Money; and then the Parliament growing uneasie, they were again sent a Grazing for a good while. The King hoping when he had the management of the Cash, to frustrate the Effect of the Act which he had passed against his good Friends the <hi>Roman Catholicks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now the King having got the Money in his Hands, a new Project was set on foot to set up an Army in <hi>England,</hi> for the introducing of Slavery and Popery,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:62803:39"/>
under pretence of Landing in <hi>Holland:</hi> Which was raised with all the Expedition imaginable; over which, as Colonel <hi>Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerald,</hi> an Irish Papist, was made Major General, so were the greatest number of the Captains and other Officers of the same Stamp. And because that pretence was soon blown over, it was afterward still continued on foot, under the more plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Colour of a War with <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But after all these cunning Contrivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to alter the Religion and Government of the Nation, the King being disappoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in all his Projects, and finding that the Parliament, grown more sensible of his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struse designs, and alarum'd at his extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary new Militia, both Burthensom and unnecessary for any other Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment but the support of Arbitrary Power, would give him no more Money, but began to call his Ministers in question, was forc'd to make a Peace with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and disband the Army to his great regret. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, what he could not do at hope, he resolved to do abroad; and therefore the English, Scotch and Irish Regiments, that were already in the French Service, were not only kept up in their full Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but new numbers of Soldiers were daily transported thither, to make up in
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:62803:40"/>
all a constant Body of Ten thousand Men. Which was done on purpose that he might have an Army train'd up under the <hi>French</hi> Discipline and Principles, ready seasoned to be call'd back into <hi>England</hi> for the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of any opportune Enterprize upon his Protestant Subjects.</p>
            <p>Thus far we have seen the King's inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate Malice to his Neighbours and Allies the <hi>Dutch,</hi> meerly upon the account of their being Protestants, and Protectors of the Protestant Religion, and his pernicious Conjunction with the <hi>French</hi> King, to their utter Destruction and Desolation. A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Series of Treachery and Faith-breaking, which only that <hi>Romish</hi> Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>That there is no Faith to be kept with Hereticks,</hi> could have infused into his Breast. Now let us take a short view of his Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, from the beginning of his Restoration, to the French King, the Mortal Enemy of his Subjects, and the Religion which they profess.</p>
            <p>It is well known in general, how much the Extraordinary Kindness of <hi>Charles</hi> the Second to <hi>Lewis</hi> the Fourteenth, has contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to that vast increase of Shipping and Experience in the Art of Navigation, to which they are now arrived; which no Prince in the World that might have been
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:62803:40"/>
so strong at Sea as his Majesty might have been, with half the Expence which he squander'd away to ruin the nation, had he been sensible in the least of his own Grandure, the welfare of his ow Subjects, and the danger of having so potent a Rival for the Dominion of the Sea, which God and Nature seemed to have appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to himself. We have been told of brisk Messenger sent to the <hi>French</hi> Kings, so soon as they did but lay the Carkass of a pitiful Flyboat upon the Stocks. But such was the Complaisance of our Supine Monarch, that he not only connived at the industrious Preparations of the <hi>French</hi> King, but lent him his helping Hand to make him Master of his own Rights. When they had none of their own, he sent Vice-Admirals, and other considerable Sea-Officers, to encourage and promote the setting out of their Fleets. He pitied their want of Experience in Sea Affairs, and out of Compassion and Brotherly Love, lead their rare Sea-men by the Hand, train'd them up in his Fleets, and among the best of his Sea-men, taught them the Skill which they had been forcod to toyl for by the Experience of many Ages; and to crown all, even to fight for them, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpose between them and Danger, with
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:62803:41"/>
so good Success, that the French Squadron, as if the Engagement had been only designed for a Diversion and Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to them, came off as fresh and as whole, as when they first sailed out of their own Ports, was such an unparallell'd Kindness, that nothing but the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary hopes the King had placed in him, of being his great Assistant for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing of his pernicious designs upon his own Subjects, could have made him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend to.</p>
            <p>But to come to Particulars, It was a strange Demonstration of the King of <hi>England</hi>'s kindness to the <hi>French</hi> Interest, though to the unspeakable Detriment of his own People, that after all those Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions in the Lord Keeper <hi>Bridgman</hi>'s Speech, of the Treaty between <hi>France</hi> and the King of <hi>England,</hi> concerning Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, wherein the King would have, as he said, such a singular regard to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Trade of this Nation, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the intolerable Oppression upon the <hi>English</hi> Traffick in <hi>France,</hi> ever since the King's Restoration, he had not in all that time made one step toward a Treaty of Commerce or Navigation with him; no not even at that time, when the English
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:62803:41"/>
were so necessary to him, that he could not have begun the War without them, and therefore at such a Conjuncture might probably have condescended to some Equality of Terms. But the King of <hi>England</hi> well understood how careful the <hi>French</hi> King was to preserve and increase the Trade of his Subjects, and that it was by the diminution of that Beam of his Glory, that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> had raised his Indignation. The King therefore, the more to gratifie him, made it his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Maxim, to burthen his <hi>English</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants here with one Hand, while the <hi>French</hi> in his own Territories loaded them no less with the other. So that when the <hi>English</hi> Merchants in <hi>London</hi> had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared a Petition to the King and Council, to complain of the Oppression which their Factors and Agents lay under in <hi>France,</hi> with a true State of their Case, and a short account of their Grievances, information thereof was given to the Court, by which means the Perusal of the Papers being transmitted by the King <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o his Instruments, all further Prosecution of the matter was stopp'd by his Conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ance and Authority, and the Merchants were put off with a Promise, that the <hi>French</hi> Embassador should be acquainted
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:62803:42"/>
with their Complaints, and that they should be redress'd through his means. Which proving ineffectual, upon their farther Applications for redress, they were Hector'd, Brow-beaten, Ridicul'd, and might have met with fairer Audience from <hi>Monsieur Colbert.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor was it only in the matter of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, that the King of <hi>England</hi> had obliged the <hi>French</hi> Tyrant, but even in the War it self. For that except the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistible Bounties o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> so great a Prince, to some particular <hi>English</hi> Instruments, and a little Subsistance Money for the Fleet, frugally parted with, the King of <hi>England</hi> had put him to no Charges, but the <hi>English</hi> Navy Royal had served him all along, <hi>No Purchase, No Pay.</hi> He had ty'd the <hi>French</hi> King to no Terms, had demanded no Partisson of Conquests, had made no humane Condition, but had sold him all for those two Pearls of high Value, the <hi>True Roman Catholick Worship,</hi> and the true <hi>French</hi> Government.</p>
            <p>So soon as the Peace was concluded betwixt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> by the Awe of the Parliament, the <hi>French</hi> King, as a mark of his Displeasure, and to humble
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:62803:42"/>
the <hi>English</hi> Nation, let loose his Privateers among the <hi>English</hi> Merchants; insomuch that there was no security of Commerce or Navigation, notwithstanding the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick Amity betwixt the two Crowns, but at Sea they Murther'd, Plunder'd, made Prize, and Confiscated all they met with: Their <hi>Piccaroons</hi> lay before the Mouths of our Rivers; hover'd all along the Coast; took our Ships in the very Ports, so that we were in a manner block'd up by Water; and in this manner it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued from 1674. till the latter end of 1676. without Remedy. And yet all this while that the <hi>French</hi> made these intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Depredations, and Piracies upon the Kings Subjects, they were more diligently than ever supply'd from <hi>England</hi> with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits, and those that would go voluntarily into the French Service were encouraged, others that would not press'd, imprison'd, and carried over by main force and constraint: And by the King's connivance, his own Magazines were daily emptied, to furnish the <hi>French</hi> with all sorts of Ammunition, of which the following Accompt affords but a small Parcel, in comparison of what was daily conveyed away, under colour of Cockets for <hi>Iersey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:62803:43"/>Granado's without number, shipped off under the pretence of unwrought I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron.</p>
            <p>Lead Shot One and twenty Tuns.</p>
            <p>Gunpouder Seven thousand one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thirty four Barrels.</p>
            <p>Iron Shot Eighteen Tun Six hundred Weight.</p>
            <p>Match, Eighty eight Tun, nineteen hundred Weight.</p>
            <p>Iron Ordinance, Four hundred forty one; Quantity, Two hundred ninety two Tuns, nine hundred Weight: Carriages, Bandaliers, Pikes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the quantity uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
            <p>All this, and what more beside, not then discovered, was exported from <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> to <hi>France,</hi> from <hi>Iune</hi> 1675. to <hi>Iune</hi> 1677.</p>
            <p>And thus was the <hi>French</hi> King gratified for undoing us by Sea; by Contributing all the King could rap and rend, of Men and Ammunition, to make him more Potent and Formidable to us by Land.</p>
            <p>Another great Instance of the King of <hi>England</hi>'s extraordinary Kindness to the <hi>French</hi> King was this, that while he
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:62803:43"/>
storm'd at the <hi>Dutch</hi> for not promoting as he pretended, the coming away of some Families that were unwilling to leave <hi>Surinam</hi>; he found no fault with the <hi>French</hi> for keeping him above four years out of St. <hi>Christophers</hi>; nor for destroying in the mean while that part of the Island which belonged to his own Subjects. So great a piece of rudeness it was thought, to press too hard upon the French King for performance of Articles on his side. Nay, the French Commanders in those Parts, did not scruple to assert, that there was a very good understanding, in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to that Island, between the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Court; so great a kindness the King had for the French, so little for his own Subjects.</p>
            <p>Nor must we omit, that when the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the French Privy Council, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding all their Sea Officers and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders in the Islands of <hi>America,</hi> to secure to their Master the Soveraignity of those Seas, were brought by a Person of Quality into the Cabinet Council at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> they were at first declaimed against, but soon buried in oblivion, and put up amongst the useless Papers, though the French, in pursuance of those Commands
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:62803:44"/>
proved afterwards so vexatious to the <hi>English,</hi> that thethen Governor of <hi>Iamaica</hi> sent word, that notwithstanding their old Quarrel with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> it was much easier to keep a good Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with them, than with our dear Allies the <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor must it be forgot, as an Eminent Mark of our Sovereign's Deference to the <hi>French</hi> Interest and manner of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that in the year 1677, upon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that a Great <hi>French</hi> Embassador was coming over into <hi>England,</hi> he Adjourn'd his <hi>English</hi> Parliament, that he might have the more Elbow room to entertain his bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter beloved Friends. For all things at that time moved between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> with that punctual Regularity, that it was like the Harmony of the Sphears, so that immediately after the Recess of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> Parliament, over came the <hi>D. of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui,</hi> the <hi>Archbishop of Rheimes, M. Barillon,</hi> with a Train of three or four hundred Persons of all Qualities, (you would have sworn they had been the Lords Spiritual and Temporal of <hi>France,</hi> with a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable number of their Commons) met the King at <hi>New-Market,</hi> so that it look'd like another Parliament; and that the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:62803:44"/>
               <hi>English</hi> had been Adjourn'd for their better Reception.</p>
            <p>Much of their business no doubt was conceal'd, but so much came to light, that they prest the King to continue his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in the Service of <hi>France</hi>; because the Parliament at that time most earnestly prest, and was preparing a Bill for their being call'd home. They also demanded an Abolition of all Claims and Demands from the Subjects of <hi>France,</hi> upon account of all Prizes made of the <hi>English</hi> since the year 1674, till that day and for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And the King on the other side required a further supply of <hi>French</hi> Money. And certain it is, that though the <hi>English</hi> Parliament was kept a loof from the Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of War, Peace and Alliance, as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper for their meddling withal; yet with those three Estates of, <hi>France</hi> all things were negotiated and transacted with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est confidence imaginable. To which purpose they were Adjourn'd from <hi>New-Market</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> and there continued till the return of the <hi>English</hi> Parliament, but then dismissd home, though with all the Signs and Demonstrations of mutual Affection imaginable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:62803:45"/>And indeed the effect of their Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion soon after appeared; for the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment still insisting, that the King's Subjects might be recalled out of the French King's Service; pressing the King to enter into a League Offensive and Defensive, with the States-General, and taking up a Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, that they would proceed upon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, till satisfied in the Business of the French Affairs and Popery; they were put off by Adjournments from time to time, or as it may be more truly said, kick'd from Adjournment to Adjournment, as from one Stair down to another, to the end the French King might have the more leisure to compleat his Conquests in <hi>Flanders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And from this last usage of his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we may justly take occasion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect his Behaviour all along to the Grand Council of the Nation, of which in his glavering Letters before his Resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, he had so high an Esteem, and thought them <hi>so necessary for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Kingdom, that neither Prince nor People could be in any tolerable degree happy without them;</hi> yet to which his Malice was so inveterate, after once he came to be safe in his Throne, that no
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:62803:45"/>
Man could use them with more Scorn and Contempt.</p>
            <p>His first Parliament began at <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> the Eighth of <hi>May</hi> 1667. a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment so kind to him, and so confident of the Sincerity and Integrity of his Words, that they gave him back the Triennial Bill, and laid themselves at his Mercy, to do with them what he pleased; whereas before they had power to Assemble every three years by an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted Law. And no less frankly they sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render'd the power of the Militia into his Hands; of both which Acts, being done in haste, they had leisure enough afterwards to repent.</p>
            <p>But notwithstanding all the great Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of this Parliament, and their more than extraordinary Liberality to the King, of several Millions of the Peoples Money, which was with the same profu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion wasted upon his Pleasures, and the carrying on his Designs for the Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of Popery and French Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not a Penny hardly for the good of the Nation, while the Seamen were fed with a Bit and a Knock, and the Merchants that supplied the Stores of the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:62803:46"/>
Nay were cheated of their Money, and never paid to this day; with what Scorn and Contempt he used them, and how far from that Esteem and Veneration he professed to have for them, while he was wheedling for his Restoration, is apparent to all the Kingdom. 'Tis true, the King continued them till all men of Impartial Knowledge and Judgment thought them Dissolved by Law; and till at length they were Dissolved by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the Twenty fifth of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1678. Not that they Sate so long; but were discontinued and contemptuously spurn'd from Meeting to Meeting, many times by the intimated Orders, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Designs of the <hi>French King,</hi> and never suffered to Sit, but when the King was in extream necessity of Money. Among the rest of these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logations, there was one at a time when the greatest urgency of Affairs, the greatest danger that ever threatned the Welfare of this Nation, required their Sitting, when they were diving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the bottom of the Popish Plot, and endeavouring to bring to condign Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment the chief Instruments which the King had made use of to compass his Arbitrary and Popish Design. But
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:62803:46"/>
then it was that the King to screen his wicked Ministers from Publick Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, preferr'd the Caresses of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panded nakedness of a <hi>French</hi> Harlot, before the preservation of three Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. For then it was, as Mr. <hi>Andrew Marvel,</hi> with a Satyrical Indignation ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses it.
<q>
                  <l>That Carwel, that Incestuous Punk,</l>
                  <l>Made our most Sacred Sovereign drunk;</l>
                  <l>And drunk she let him give the Buss,</l>
                  <l>Which still the Kingdom's bound to Curse.</l>
               </q>
This was the Effect of that nights bloudy debauch, which continued till the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and all the morning till the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was Dissolv'd, or Orders at least given for the doing it. For the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and the rest of the Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, being very uneasie under the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Inspections which the two Houses made into the Secrets of this Popish Plot, but lately discover'd, would not endure their Sitting any longer. On the other side, the King, being alarm'd by the detection of so many design'd
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:62803:47"/>
Contrivances against his Person, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move him out of the World, for which the Papists had so little reason, unless it were to make him more hasty than stood with the Rules and Methods of his Politicks, was the more willing to let the Parliament sit, for fear of exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperating the Nation at such a ticklish Conjuncture of Affairs as at that time, when all the Protestants of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom were awakened by such dreadful Consternations and Jealousies. What therefore could not be obtained by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Perswasion when His Majesty was sober and sensible, must be wrested form him when he was intoxicated. To this purpose <hi>Portsmouth</hi> was fully instructed what to do, and as being privy to the whole Conspiracy against the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, was entrusted to manage the Business. The Night was spent in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rousing and Buffooning, so that His Majesty by Morning was far from that Condition in which he used to appear at Chappel. In the Morning <hi>Ports<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> retir'd with the King and two Great Ladies more, into a more Private Room, where to bind him the faster in her Charms, and that he might have no
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:62803:47"/>
time for second Thought, the three Ladies placed themselves before his Eyes in the posture of the three Naked Goddesses, in expectation of their Sentences from the <hi>Trojan Sheepherd</hi>; and in that Posture going to the Sport of <hi>Questions</hi> and <hi>Commands,</hi> when it came to <hi>Portsmouth</hi>'s turn to Rule, she asked her Monarchical Subject, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would have Two <hi>Commands</hi> and One <hi>Question,</hi> or Two <hi>Questions</hi> and One <hi>Command</hi>: To which when the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, <hi>One Command and Two Questions</hi>: The Strumpet presently cried our, <hi>Then I command ye to Dissolve the Parliament. Ahassuerus</hi> could have said no more, nor have been more absolutely obey'd; for that very Morning the Parliament was Prorogu'd accordingly; notwithstanding all that P. <hi>Rupert,</hi> when he heard the Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution was taken, could urge with all the vehemency imaginable against it; while the D. of <hi>York</hi> stuck close to his Brother, and told him his Cousin rav'd. So that the Duke, that advised for the Ruine of the Nation, was believed; but the Prince, who spoke his mind freely for the good of the Kingdom, was dismissed for a Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:62803:48"/>So well did the King act his part, that when his well-meaning Counsellors lent their assisting hands to prevent the Consequences of <hi>French</hi> and Popish Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates, they were mistaken in the Man, and gave their wholsom Advice to him that was bound not to take it, and was himself the <hi>Primum Mobile</hi> of all the Disorders which they besought of him to remedy.</p>
            <p>During this Sessions of Parliament, many foul things came to light: For while the King had raised an Army, and pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Parliament for Money to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them, under pretence of making a War with <hi>France,</hi> which was the earnest desire of all the Protestant part of the Kingdom, the Parliament were fully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that while the King boasted of the Alliances which he had made for the preservation of <hi>Flanders</hi> and the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Religion both at home and abroad, he was secretly entred into Treaties and Alliances at the same time with the <hi>French</hi> King; and Mr. <hi>Garraway</hi> of the House of Commons had gotten a Copy of the Private Treaty between the King of <hi>England</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> King, at the same
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:62803:48"/>
instant, that the Secretary and all the Court Pentioners cried out a <hi>War</hi>; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that such of the Conspirators as were in the House began to blush when they saw the Cheat so palpably discerned. It was farther discovered, that a great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite of the Duke's had been sent over into <hi>France,</hi> under a pretence of Expostu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating, and requiring satisfaction for the Injuries which the <hi>English</hi> had received from the <hi>French</hi>: but in reality, to carry the Project of Articles for the Peace, and to settle and confirm all things fast about the Money that was to come from <hi>France,</hi> and to agree the Methods for shamming the Confederates about their Expected Alliances. They found themselves chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of all the Pole Bill Money, which they had given so little a while before, upon the assurance of a War intended against <hi>France</hi>; the greatest part of which they perceived was imediately, though appropriated to the <hi>French</hi> Wur only, converted to other uses, as the paying of old Debts, so that very little was left to pay for any Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries bought, or to be bought, toward the pretended War with <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:62803:49"/>Nor were they ignorant of the real Design, for which the King had raised his Army, and what care the King and his Brother took, that there should be no other Officers in that Army, than what were fit for the Work in hand, which was to introduce Popery and French Government by main force; Four parts of Five being downright Papists, or else such as resolved so to be upon the least intimation. The Duke recommending all such as he knew fit for the Turn, and no less than a Hundred Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions being sign'd by Secretary <hi>W.</hi> to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ish Papists, to raise Forces, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the late Act; by which means both the Land and Naval Forces were in safe hands: And to compleat the Work, hardly a Judge, Justice of the Peace, or any Officer in <hi>England,</hi> but what was of the Duke's Promotion. Nor were they ignorant of the private Negotiations carried on by the Duke, with the Kings Connivance, with the Pope and Cardinal <hi>Norfolk,</hi> who had undertaken to raise Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney from the Church, sufficient to supply the King's Wants, till the Work were done, in case the Parliament should smoak their Design, and refuse to give any
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:62803:49"/>
more. Nor was the Parliament ignorant what great Rejoycing there was in <hi>Rome</hi> it self, to hear in what a posture his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty was, and how well provided of an Army and Money to begin the Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
            <p>The Parliament also understood, while they were labouring the War with <hi>France,</hi> and to resist the growth of Popery and Arbitrary Power, that the King underhand assisted the <hi>French</hi> with Men and Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of all sorts; and soon after that a Cessation was concluded both at <hi>Nime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghen</hi> and <hi>Paris</hi>; and that the King had got some money from <hi>France</hi> for that Jobb; by which means the <hi>French</hi> King was now sure to hold all his Conquests abroad, which, had <hi>England</hi> been real to the Confederates, might have been easily wrested again out of his Hands. But it seems it was not so much Money as the King expected, which made him an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, so that he began to threaten, that if the <hi>French</hi> King did not perform his Promise of 300000 <hi>l.</hi> Annuity for three Years, he would undo all he had done against the next Parliament. But the <hi>French</hi> King derided those vain Threats, menacing in his turn, that if the King
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:62803:50"/>
of <hi>England</hi> would not be content with his Terms, and do and say to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, according to his directions, he would discover both him and his Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondents, in betraying the Nation, and discover all his secret Contrivances against the Kingdom, as afterwards he Published the <hi>Dover</hi> Treaty at <hi>Paris</hi>; which was the reason, that after that, His Majesty of <hi>England</hi> never durst disoblige the <hi>French Monsieur,</hi> but became a perfect Slave to his Interest: a Bondage he never needed to have undergone, had he been but half as sincere to his <hi>English</hi> Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But to them he was never true, with them he always broke his Faith and Royal Word; insomuch, that after they had given him Money to Disband his Army, he employed the Money to another use, and kept up his standing Forces, to the great Terror of the People in all parts of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>So that now all things running on the Papistical side to their Hearts desire, what with Popish Souldiers, Popish Officers, Popish Counsels, Popish Priests and Jesuits swarming about the Town and Country, and <hi>France</hi> at leisure to help them who had help'd him to be
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:62803:50"/>
more a Conqueror by the Peace, than he could have expected by a War; the Duke of <hi>York</hi> was for the Kings pulling off his Vizard, and for setting up <hi>Alamode of France,</hi> according to what had been so often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated at <hi>White hall</hi> and St. <hi>Iames</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>But while the King and his Brother were thus riding Post to ruin the Laws and Religion of the Kingdom, the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the Popish Plot by Dr. <hi>Oats,</hi> broke all their Measures for a time, by laying open the Secret Contrivances of our <hi>English Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux</hi> for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing of Popery and Arbitrary Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>This Plot was no sooner made known to the King, but he imparts it to the Duke, not the knowledge of the Plot, for that they both knew before, but the News of the Plots being disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. Upon which they set themselves, with all the care they could, to stop the farther Progress of the Discovery. To which purpose the Duke gives notice of it to his Man <hi>Coleman,</hi> and the Priests and Jesuits in the <hi>Savoy</hi>; by which means, what Papers and Persons were to be conceal'd, and conveyed away, was
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:62803:51"/>
carefully looked after. All this while by this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>easonable detection of the King and his Brother to the Priests Jesuits, <hi>Oats</hi> himself narrowly escaped Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacred.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oats</hi> finding himself thus betray'd and abandoned by the King, applies himself to Sir <hi>Edmund Bury Godfry,</hi> with a Scheme of the Plot fairly drawn up, by that means to be introduced before the Council, to have the Business there unfolded; which with much ado was done; and <hi>Oats</hi> sent for to be Examined at <hi>Whitehall</hi>; where he managed himself with that Courage, that though he were Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beaten and opposed most strenuously, though there were many that studied by all the ways imaginable to dash and confound him, yet it was impossible; he stood as firm as a Rock, and gave such pregnant Reasons for what he said, that the Council, how unwilling soever to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, or stir in his behalf, yet at last were constrained, by the clearness of his Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to grant Warrants for the seizure of several Priests that Night, who were taken and sent to Prison.</p>
            <p>Upon this followed the Assassination and Murder of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfry,</hi> perpetrated by the Countenance and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivance
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:62803:51"/>
of the King, as well a, by the Contrivances and express Command of the Duke. For proof of which, a little opening of the Cause and Occasion, and a short relation of the Effects, Consequences and Events which enstied upon it, will both enlighten us to the truth of the Matter, and confirm our Belief, who were the Authors of and Accessors to it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>For, as has been already said, that Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman had received an Information upon Oath from Dr. <hi>Oats,</hi> about a Plot against our Laws, Lives and Religion. But finding somthing in the Deposition that reflected upon Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> with whom he had an intimate Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, he thereupon took an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to let him understand what Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation he had receeived, and to tell him, that the only way to justifie his own Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, was to contribute all his Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and Assistance to prevent so Bloody <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

but that it was advanced so far, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by Persons of that Quality in the Nation, and Figure in the Government, there was no possibility to give a Lett or Disappointment to it. And more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly he told him, that the King was the Principal Author and Chief Promoter of the whole Design of overthrowing the Protestant Religion, and altering the Government: which <hi>Coleman</hi> calling to mind after his being committed to <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi> and considering that by that means Sir <hi>Edmond</hi> was enabled to come in a second Witness against him: he therefore order'd it so; as not only to get the Duke acquainted with his own danger, but that His Highness and others, whom he had mentioned in conversation with Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund,</hi> were in the seme Predicament, and would certainly be brought upon the Stage. To which he received this Answer from the Duke, That he should not be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive of any danger from Sir <hi>Edmund,</hi> in regard there would be a way found to prevent his hurting <hi>Coleman,</hi> or any body else. Now that he was thereupon most barbarously Murdered, is a thing too well known: and then by whose Authority it was done, the Circumstances make it plain.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:62803:52"/>First, the Circumstance of the Place, as being committed in one of the Courts of the King's Palace, in some of the Apartments of which the Murther'd Body was also concealed for several days. The next circumstan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e was, the guarding of the Gate and Avenues of the Palace so strictly all the time, and denying the People their wonted Liberty of access to the House, and passage through, which could not have been done, but by the King's Authority. Nor would the Dutchess of <hi>Portsmouth,</hi> and somebody of the same Sex, greater than She, have adventured to have gone and viewed the Body, while it lay there concealed, by which they involved themselves in the Guilt of the Crime, but that they knew they could not be called to an Account for it, considering by whose Connivance and Command the Fact was committed. Nor was it a less Argument that the King was privy to the Fact; That he protected from Justice both the Duke and others which were charged with that Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Than which nothing more than the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it with his own hands, could lay him under the Reproach and In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>amy of it before Men, and under the dreadful Guilt of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God.</p>
            <p>Add to this, That when we consider the Motives that urged the necessity of this Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:62803:53"/>
which was <hi>Coleman</hi>'s having acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd to Sir <hi>Edmund,</hi> that the King as well as the Duke was in the Conspiracy to alter the Government, and overturn our Religion, it would be nonsense to believe the King less willing to have him destroy'd than his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Since no Body at that time was so sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the detection of that part of the Plot as the King; neither did any body labour after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to baffle the belief of it, as he did. Nor had he any thing in the World to excuse himself for so doing; but that he was the principal Author of all that part of the Popish Plot, which related to the overthrow of the Laws and Religion of the Nation, and the destruction of the chief and most zealous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants in the Kingdom, as was sufficiently acknowledged by <hi>Coleman,</hi> not only to Sir <hi>Edm. Godfrey,</hi> but to the Committee of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament that examined him in <hi>Newgate.</hi> Which was so plain, that nothing influenced those Gentlemen to conceal that part of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession in their Report to the House, but their pity and compassion to the King, which would not permit them to expose him so black, as in truth he was to the Nation; though it was as certain, that they frequently imparted their Knowledge to their Frinds.</p>
            <p>Nor did it a little add to confirm the Truth of what is here related, That Emissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:62803:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>
should be sent from the Court to deal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hand with the <hi>Coroner,</hi> and the Jury, to have gotten a Verdict of <hi>Felo de se.</hi> But the proofs of his being murther'd were so apparent; such as his Neck being broke, and the clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Shoes, that nothing could corrupt the Jury from bringing it in otherwise than it was.</p>
            <p>Under these Distresses did the King and the Duke labour: Terribly afraid of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Parliament, for the sake of their Popish Minions and Instruments, whose ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most care and industry could not prevent it, but that several of <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Letters and other Papers were found, which detected the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations of the King and Duke (for all the World can never separate them by maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Duke durst ever have transacted such Treasons abroad, being then no more than another Subject, without his Brother's Consent) so that they were in an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary quandary, whether the Parliament should Sit or no. But the King's extreme necessity for Money, prevail'd upon him to let them Sit: Besides that, the King, who all along acted under his Protestant Mask, was sensible that the Kingdom would have cry'd out shame, had he put off the Parliament of such a Conjuncture of Combustion and Distraction as that was.</p>

Which passed Both Houses without any difficulty; but the King, out of his Zeal to the <hi>Protestant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> refused to pass it. And then it was, that the Parliament found too late the Compliment which they had pass'd upon him in returning him the Power of the Militia, which he made
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:62803:55"/>
use of to keep up Standing Armies for their Destruction, but refused for the Security of the Nation.</p>
            <p>This therefore not prevailing, they began to provide against Papists sitting in either House; and fram'd a Bill with a Test to be taken by every Member of both Houses, or else to lose their Seats. This, though his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Majesty durst not openly oppose him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, yet after a close Consultation held at St. <hi>Iames</hi>'s<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he ordered all his Instruments in the Lords House to withstand the passing of it there; which though they could not effect, yet they prevail'd so far, that they got a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viso in it for the D. of <hi>York</hi> whereby they did him the kindness as to declare him a Papist to all the World.</p>
            <p>After this, the Parliament proceeded to the impeaching of such Persons as they had found to be deepest in the Contrivance of all our Mischiefs; but That His Majesty lookt upon as a Business that so nearly concerned his own Honour, that like his Father, when the D. of <hi>Buckingham</hi> was accus'd of poyson<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Father, he would not endure the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in such a <hi>Iehu</hi>-like Chace after the Popish Conspirators, but foot-ball'd them again with a Prorogation for several Months. So careful was his Protestant Majesty to stifle as much as in him lay, and to prevent the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:62803:55"/>
Prosecution of an Infernal Plot, which he knew was so deeply laid, like the Axe of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, to the root of all his Protestant Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</p>
            <p>Nor was this all; for so soon as he had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss'd the Parliament, and had secur'd his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complices, he took all the care imaginable to discredit <hi>Oates</hi> and <hi>Bedlow</hi>'s Evidence; Forty One was again inculcated into all the Ignorant <hi>Pates</hi> about the Town, and Merry-Andrew <hi>Roger</hi> had his Pension out of the <hi>Gazetts</hi> continued to ridicule the Plot, which he did in a most leud and shameless manner; and Money given to set up a new Divinity Academy in a Publick Coffee House, to act the Protestant Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and give about his Revelation-Cup to the Raw Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Clergy, and instruct them in better Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine than ever they learnt in the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity.</p>
            <p>Nor did he stop at the endeavouring to discredit the Testimonies of those Witnesses, but sent his Head-Emissaries to corrupt them to a denial, and retracting what they had discovered; and when that would not do, <hi>Knox</hi> and <hi>Lane</hi> were suborn'd to accused <hi>Otes</hi> of Buggery, thereby to bave taken him. Acts of the foulest ignominy, which whether a Protestant King would have encouraged, to the ruine of the Religion which he professed,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:62803:56"/>
in partial postcrity will determine with a clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and more unclouded sight: For we, God knows, are so dazled with those Illustrious Beams of feigned <hi>Protestant</hi> Majesty, that we are not able to stare upon those Rays without blinding our Eyes, out of a false Devotion to the Sun of our vain Imagination.</p>
            <p>Add to this, his endeavouring to corrupt the yet untainted Members of the House, and buy their Votes, to the utter exhausting of his Treasure, for that which was then call'd <hi>Secret Service.</hi> And which was more than all the rest, his Dissolution of this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring Parliament, at the Sollicitation of the Duke, and the rest of his guilty Minions, by the Advice of a certain Lady, who to save her Husband from the Impeachment he lay under, persuaded them to get the King to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally to Dissolve the Parliament; using this Argument, That in regard the Nation were so dissatisfied in this, it would be a means to gain him the favour of the people, and baffle the Impeachment, by getting it Dissolv'd; especially when it should be known, that it was done by his procurement: So that the Lady's Advice being followed, the Parliament was as easily Dissolv'd, as it had been a little before lasciviously Prorogued, after a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of Seventeen Years, to the great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of all men; tho indeed it proved
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:62803:56"/>
in some measure a happy day for <hi>England</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For the Dissolution so enraged the Band of Pensioners, finding their Service so slighted, and their livelihood lost, that they began to talk loud, and discovered those things which were no way for the disadvantage of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>But here we are t observe the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Diligence of his <hi>Protestant</hi> Majesty, to get the next Parliament fit for his Turn, which was suddenly to be called, to stop the mouths of the People.</p>
            <p>To which purpose all the Money that could possibly be spared out of the <hi>Chequer,</hi> was issued out to <hi>C. B.</hi> to manage the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions all over the Kingdom, under the old Notion of secret Service, in one Article 1500 <hi>l.</hi> in another 2000. and the <hi>Guinea's</hi> stew about the Countrey far and near to the Corporations, to hire places, and get fit men, the Heads of the Counties and Corporations were sent for, and told what men would be serviceable and acceptable to the King; and particularly the Gentlemen of <hi>Essex</hi> were sent to, by the Ch.

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:62803:57"/>
such men as they were directed. What could more have been done by a Protestant Prince, to destroy his Protestant Subjects, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the <hi>Roman-Catholick</hi> Cause?</p>
            <p>But when the Conspiraters saw that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing would, but that they perceived that they were deceived in their Expectations by the unanimous choice of the People, then all ways were studied to put them upon Rocks, and to set them together by the Ears, and throwing in Bones among them, and by work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to fly upon the Ministers of State, as the only infallible means to blow them up; as being sure of the King's Resolutions to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpose between them and danger, whatever became of the Parliament and Kingdom. If this fail'd, the King was furnish'd with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contrivance, which was so cajole and delude them, by pretending all the Sincerity and Reality in the World, when he meant quite the contrary; and rather than miss of his Designs, to publish himself to Posterity, the greatest Knave in nature; and to let the world know how much he could out-do <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius</hi> in dissimulation.</p>
            <p>To this purpose, when the Project of the King's rejecting the Commons Choice of their Speaker, fail'd, tho it were done on purpose by the King to pick a quarrel with the House as soon as they sate; the King
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:62803:57"/>
pursuing his old methods of speaking with his Lips, what was farthest from his heart, went to the House of Lords, and there tells the Parliament a plausible Story, how he had consented to the Exclusion of the Popish Lords from their Seats in Parliament; to the Execution of several Criminals, both upon the score of the Plot, and the Murder of Sir <hi>Ed. B. Godfrey</hi>; but above all, how he had commanded his Brother to absent himself from him, because he would not leave the most malicious men room to say he had not removed all Causes which could be pretended to influence him towards Popish Counsels. In all which there was not one word of Thruth, as to the Motives that engaged him to do what he did.</p>
            <p>For as to the Exclusion of the Popish Lords, he knew it was what he could not avoid, unless he would have absolutely thrown off his Protestant Mask, which he was sensible it was not seasonable for him then to do. As for the Jesuits that were hang'd for the Plot, he pleas'd himself as well as the people, by sacrificing a few inconsiderable Miscreants to his own Revenge, for ingratefully plotting against his Life, who had all along been so faith<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ul to their Cause; and indeed it was but just they should dye like Knaves and Traytors, who had been such fools to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:62803:58"/>
so true a <hi>Protestant</hi> Prince. As to the Murtherers of Sir <hi>E. B. G.</hi> what could he have done less, except he would have exposed himself to the Clamour of the whole Nation? That would have been the greatest folly in the world, for a Man that loved to sleep in a whole skin, as he did, for the preservation of three or four Rascals convicted of a bloody Murder, to have sacrificed his Honour and his Safety to publick Scandal and Resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>And then as for the Removal of his Dear Brother, it was done after a long and deep Consultation upon these Considerations: First, That the Duke's being out of the way, might stop the farther Examination of the Plot in relation to himself, and thereby one of the Chief Conspirators be preserved safe: And secondly, For a shew that the King was such an Enemy to <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Popish</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, that he would not suffer so much as the Breath of a Brother near him, for fear of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. For in these Gracious <hi>Protestant</hi> Acts, lay all his hopes of making the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment give Credit to his Words, and getting Money from them, at a time when the <hi>French</hi> King most treacherously failed him Tho while the King was thus endeavouring to cast a Mist before the Parliament's Eyes, it was most certain, that before the Duke
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:62803:58"/>
went, the King had promised him, That no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing should be acted or done, without being first imparted to him; insomuch, that the Speech which was to be made to the Parliament, was concluded on before he went; and tho he were absent in <hi>Flanders,</hi> where Expresses reached him almost every hour, yet the Grand Politicians of the Conspiracy staid behind, and watched his Affairs at home, as diligently as if he had been here in person.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless the Parliament, not being to be deluded by all those seeming Acts of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant</hi> Grace, took little notice of those gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Trappings of the King's Discourse, but fell briskly to work upon the <hi>Plot,</hi> and the Murther of Sir <hi>E. B. G.</hi> to which purpose they made choice of a Secret Committee to pursue that Business, by whose means great things were discovered; insomuch, That there were very few of the chiefest of those who were nearest about the King, and most effectually possessed His Ear, but were found to have some hand or finger in the Grand Conspiracy. According to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, <hi>Shew me the Company, and I'll tell thee the Man</hi>; which put the Parliament to lay all other Considerations aside, but those of securing the Nation against <hi>Popery</hi> and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Government; in order whereunto, they began to think of bringing the Lords
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:62803:59"/>
and others in the Tower to their Tryals: And upon a report of their Committee, of the D. of <hi>York</hi>'s Letters, wherein it appear'd what great joy had been conceived at <hi>Rome</hi> for the Duke's Conversion, even to <hi>draw Tears from his Holiness's Eyes,</hi> with several other Papers, discovering much of the Court-Intreagues with <hi>Rome</hi> and the Fathers; they Voted the hopes of his coming to the Crown, to be one of the chief Causes of the Popish-Plot; and ordered a Bill to disinable him to inherit the Imperial Crown of the Realm.</p>
            <p>These Proceedings were of so high a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and so directly tending to the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of that structure, which the King and the Duke, with the assistance of their Popish Counsels had been so long and so assiduously erecting, that it was thought requisite to treat them with all the Art and Subtilty imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; which produced two of the greatest Master-pieces that ever were acted by the Conspirators ever since their first designing Popery and <hi>French</hi> Tyranny. The first was to blind and cozen the House of Commons, by seeming to shew an utter dislike of all former Councils that had brought the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the condition it was in. In pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of which, the old Council was dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and the greatest Sticklers against the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:62803:59"/>
Plot, and for the Protestant Religion, chosen into their room, to the end the King might not be thought to be any longer influenced by Popish Advice; and that if any miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages happen'd, they might be all laid to their charge; or that miscarriages might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a more candid interpretation, as being done by such good men, against whose fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity the Nation had no exception. And thus were those Gentlemen gull'd in, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the King's more particular trust and favour, to countenance many illegal contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, to retrieve the bad condition of the Papists, under the notion of their Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: So that if <hi>Dissimulare</hi> be <hi>Regnare,</hi> never had any Monarch more of Kingcraft in him than ours had, to the destruction of his own Subjects.</p>
            <p>The next Device was to turn the whole Plot, and the Odium of it, upon the <hi>Protestants,</hi> under the notion of Presbyterians and Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks: Which how well it pleased the <hi>King,</hi> will afterwards appear.</p>
            <p>The first Project had this effect, That many of the Leading Men for the Country, of both Houses (for the same alterations were made among the Commissioners of the Treasury, and Lords of the Admiralty) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inveagled and drawn aside by the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Places both of Profit and Honour,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:62803:60"/>
their vigour began to cool, and the unbiassed Party in both Houses were left to stand by themselves. Four or five of the most Popular in the Council were wrought off; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Matters were of importance for carrying on the <hi>Popish</hi> Cause, were first agreed on in the Private Cabal, and then brought into the Council; where if such Matters met with strong opposition, the King's Pleasure that it should be so, over-rul'd the Debates, and all things pass'd as ordered by the King in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, not with the Advice of his Council. And then such as did not heartily join, had good words given them, and were told that all was meant well; which made several give credit, and believe the rest were real. By which means, all that was done by the King and His Coadjutors, was acted behind the Curtain, and the Popular Gentlemen were only made use of as <hi>Vmbrello's</hi> to shade the Conspirators from the scorching Heat of the Peoples Discontent: So fine and subtil were the Wiles of <hi>Popery,</hi> above the reach of plain and downright <hi>Protestant</hi> Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</p>
            <p>But in the midst of these Court-Intriegues to run down the <hi>Plot,</hi> the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons went on vigorously both against the <hi>Plot,</hi> and the <hi>Pop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sh</hi> Delinquents; which grated so hard upon the <hi>Popish</hi> Party, and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:62803:60"/>
was such an obstruction to their Designs, That the King compassionating their Grievances, more than those of his <hi>Protestant</hi> Subjects, gave way to the Dissolution of the Parliament; yet with promise of another to meet toward the latter end of the year, under pretence of frequent Parliaments; but, in reality, to try if He could get another fitter for his turn.</p>
            <p>And now the King having laid aside the Parliament, and freed his Instruments from the Terrour of it, was so far from not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting himself to be influenced by <hi>Popish</hi>-Councellors, that he began to play his old pranks; and first of all the popular <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant</hi> Lords of the Council were by degrees decently laid aside, and the Duke was sent for home; the Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> for op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing it, being severely reprimanded in Council, with a wonder how any person that sate at that Board, durst so boldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front his Royal Highness? For the Face of Affairs was changed, and the King was now swimming in his own Element again. Only it was strange that he was no more concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to see the strain of the whole Kingdom run against him: For notwithstanding all his industry to have brought in his Band of Pensioners again, it was found, the new-chosen Parliament, which was by this time
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:62803:61"/>
ready to sit, was likely to prove worse for his turn than any of the former: Which made him have recourse to his old shift of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogueing, which was done by Proclamation, to gain a little time for the acquitting of Sir <hi>G. Wakeman,</hi> which the C. J. <hi>Scroggs</hi> had engaged to his Prince for a Gracious Smile, and to the <hi>Portugal</hi> Ambassador for a round sum of <hi>Guinea</hi>'s to help him out with his purchase in <hi>Essex.</hi> To which purpose, how he acted his part, is so well known, that I need not here repeat it: only thus much, That as it redounded very much to the Butcherly Indigent Chief Justice, and together with many other good Offices, continued him for a while in his Place; so it was no less for the advantage of the Papists, who from thence took the boldness to affirm there was no Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Plot. So kind was His Protestant Majesty to help out his desponding Friends at a dead lift, in order to the Sham-plot, which he was afterwards designing.</p>
            <p>For now the Parliament being put off, was at leisure to advise with his Popish Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, who were no less sedulous to give their advice to the utmost that their active Brains could reach. By this sedulity it was, that the <hi>Meal-Tub Anti-Plot</hi> was contrived, and hatch'd: Only Tools were wanting to manage, and carry on the Treacherous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign.
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:62803:61"/>
Therefore not knowing where else to find Miscreants fit for such Diabolical Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises, all the Goals about the Town were raked for needy Profligates. It will be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less to give a particular History of that which has been so sufficiently discover'd for an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable Imposture: It shall only therefore suffice to give the World an account, when the King and his Accomplices had laid the Contrivance to trepan the chiefest part of the Nobility and Gentry of the Nation, that would not comply with his Popish and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical Designs, what Favourites those <hi>Rakehells</hi> were to His Sacred Majesty, upon the account of the Villany which they had undertaken to go through with. For it is well known, that when <hi>Dangerfield</hi> was fetch'd out of <hi>Newgate,</hi> and presented to Old <hi>Rowley</hi> at <hi>White-hall,</hi> as a fit Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the Devillish work of the <hi>Meal-tub</hi>-Plot, then resolv'd upon, the King was so overjoy'd he had found such a Rascal for his turn, That he set him down on a Couch, kiss'd him, hugg'd him, and embrac'd him with all the caresses of Love imaginable, insomuch that the <hi>Newgate</hi>-Bird himself could not chuse but be surprized at his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigns kindness. His entertaining after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the same unpardon'd Coyner, and common Cheat, privately in his Closet for an
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:62803:62"/>
hour together at a time; and ever and anon giving him his hand to kiss, was no less an argument of his pious Indulgency to preme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated Villany; while his Princely Favours and Familiarity were only reserv'd to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage audacious Treachery; and his Frowns only bestowed upon the Detectors of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Enemies to God and his Kingdom. To which, we may add the severity us'd in check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord Mayor, for taking <hi>Dangerfield</hi>'s Discovery after he was committed to <hi>Newgate, for medling,</hi> as it was term'd, <hi>with that which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing concern'd him.</hi> And indeed, it may be said of the Meal-Tub-Plot, That it was a piece of Treachery so foul and ignominious, that it would have hardly passed for curr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nt in open War against a publick Enemy; and which aggravates the Crime yet more, was His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's Liberality of several times to <hi>Dangerfield,</hi> besides his allowance of Twelve pound a week out of the Privy-purse.</p>
            <p>The miscarriage of this blessed Design, caused a second proroguation of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, upon hopes of 200000 <hi>l.</hi> from <hi>France,</hi> whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h was dexterously prevented by the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi>; which the King so ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented, that his Attorney-General had Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in Council to Indict him of Buggery, with a Design to have taken away his Life,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:62803:62"/>
and repair the <hi>French</hi> disappointment by the Confiscation of his Estate, had the project ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Never so much Villany in contrivance, never so much Money ill spent, and never worse luck.</p>
            <p>But nothing could daunt the <hi>Popish Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors</hi>; and therefore, though the Meal-Tub-Conspiracy was quite baffled, yet there was another quickly hatch'd, of the same stamp and nature, though carried on by other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments. <hi>Nell Wall,</hi> an <hi>Irish Papist,</hi> and a Wench formerly employed only to empty Close-stools at <hi>White-Hall</hi>; but afterwards, for her Religion, advanced to be one of the <hi>French</hi> Dutchesses Women, and so to the King's Favour, by which she became a great States-Woman, as well as a common Whore. To this Woman a great part of the <hi>Popish</hi> Secrets were discovered, and by her means <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> was first introduced to the Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ess, and then to the King, where he was told, That the Plot would undo them, unless a way could be found to make a Counter-plot: therefore he was bid to try all ways to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it; for that no Cost should be spared, but such Rewards should be given as were fit for so great a Service. Draw, Painter, here, <hi>England</hi>'s pious Protestant Monarch, Counter-plotting with his Popish Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine, and her Close-stool Wench, against
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:62803:63"/>
his Parliament and Kingdom in favour of those that sought the destruction of both. The business of this <hi>Irish</hi> Tool, was to find out Seditious Lampoons and Pamphlets, and carry them to <hi>White-Hall,</hi> where he had Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and private Conferences with <hi>Nell Wall,</hi> the Dutchess, and the King himself; and where he had sometimes given for secret service, a Hundred, and Two Hundred Pound at a time; and was no less slabber'd by his Gracious Soveraign, than <hi>Dangerfield</hi> had been before. So zealous were <hi>We</hi> for the Popish Cause, that rather than miss of the Designs of enslaving the Nation by Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Government and Popery, that <hi>We</hi> would have declar'd our selves even to have kiss'd the Tail, as well as the Cheeks of the most Contemptible Creatures in the World.</p>
            <p>Nor must it be omitted as an Argument of His Majesty's great Zeal for the Protestant Religion, That when one <hi>Sergeant,</hi> a Priest, made a discovery of the Popish Plot from <hi>Holland,</hi> which he caus'd to be transmitted to the Court, with an intention to have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered several others, he was first brib'd off by <hi>Pillory-Carr,</hi> then sent for into <hi>England,</hi> slightly and slily <hi>examined,</hi> had his Pardon given him, and sent back with Five Pound a week, to say no more. And in this game,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:62803:63"/>
that we may understand by whose Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancing the thing was done, Sir. <hi>L. Ienkins</hi> shewed the utmost of his Parts and Fidelity, being just enter'd Secretary in the room of another, who did not care to venture so far as that both Fool, as well as Knave, did. Among whose good Services to his Master, we may reckon his endeavours as much as lay in his Power, to conceal the Murther of the Priest at <hi>Abbeville</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> upon intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he was coming into <hi>England,</hi> to make a farther discovery of the Plot: Which together with his fasting, and other infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tokens, shewed him to be plainly, what was well enough known before, Father <hi>Goff</hi>'s Creature, as well as the King's and Duke's.</p>
            <p>Nor was it a thing less astonishing to the Nation, to see the Parliament prorogued from time to time, no less than seven times, before permitted to sit, on purpose to get time for the Popish Duke to settle the Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and to the end the Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators might get heart and footing again, and retrieve their Losses in <hi>England</hi>; and in this Interval it was, that Messengers were sent to their Friends at <hi>Rome,</hi> and others their Associates, for Money to strike while the Iron was hot, in regard that <hi>Scotland</hi> by this time was secur'd, and all things in such a forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:62803:64"/>
that now or never was the time; but the Pope, had such an ill opinion of our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign's Fidelity, that he slipt his neck out of the Collar, and in imitation of him the rest excused themselves upon the score of their poverty.</p>
            <p>Thus missing money from <hi>Rome,</hi> and the rest of their <hi>Popish</hi> Associates, and the King of <hi>France</hi> refusing to part with any more Cash, there was no way but one at a forc'd-put, which was to let the Parliament sit, and to make them the more willing to give money to undo the Nation, the King in a framed Speech told them, of the wonderful Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous Alliances for the Kingdoms good he had made with Foreign Princes, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly with <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But the <hi>Parliament</hi> Incensed at the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Prorogations, fell upon Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons more profitable for the Kingdom, such as were the bringing to Condign punishment the Obstructers of their Sitting, the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaching of <hi>North</hi> for Drawing the Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation against Petitioning, and three of the Judges for dismissing the Grand Jury, before whom the Duke was Indicted of Recus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

before they could make their presentments, the prosecution of the <hi>Popish-Plot,</hi> and the Examination of the <hi>Meal-Tub-Sham</hi>; all which they lookt upon to be of greater mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than the King's Arguments for his wants. For it was well known, that by His per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>idious Dealings abroad, he had so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired his Credit with all the Foreign Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to whom he sent, that they slighted his Applications, as one upon whose Word they could never Rely. And as for the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Tangier,</hi> there was nothing less in his Thoughts: A fine Credit for a Prince, and an excellent Character to recommend him to Posterity, that he had no other than his own Sinister ends upon the Grand Council of his Kingdom, nor no other way to work them to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Miseries which his Brother's Government would bring upon the people, rather than out of any natural Affection that he bore him, took such a high Resentment against these honest and just proceedings of the Houses, that after he had Sacrificed the Lord <hi>Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> to his hopes of obtaining money; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Dukes undertaking to furnish him, he Dissolved this Parliament too, with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of another at <hi>Oxford,</hi> to sweeten the bitter Pill which he had made the Nation to swallow.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, all the Care imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble was taken to bring the <hi>Protestant-Plot</hi> to perfection; preparative to which, Judges were selected, with Dispositions, Thoughts, and Minds, as Scarlet as their Gowns.

And why was <hi>W—p</hi> readmitted to his and his Brother's Favour, but to be the principal Broker for Witnesses, and grand Minister of Subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the carrying on this bloody Design; that since he could not advance his Fortune by the prostitution of his own Daughter, he might do it by betraying the Innocent to slaughter. What a crew of Devils in the shape of Men, a Regiment of Miscreants, in whom all the Transgressions of the Law, and Morality, were muster'd together?

of his people; that the care and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness which they had still, out of mistake, for his person; that the prostrated Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of a distressed Nation; and that the foresight of these dismal Calamities he was bringing upon three spacious and opulent Kingdoms, might have interceded for some Compassion, had there been a grain of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Humanity in his Adamantine Heart; or that the heat of his Lust had not petrified all his pity.</p>
            <p>And yet as horrid as this <hi>Plot</hi> was, which nothing could equal, but that horrid Plot of his own, which this was contrived to cove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>To recite the particulars of a Design alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy so well known, and publickly exposed to all the World, would be a repetition alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether needless. This however was obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, that we were come to the height of <hi>Tiberius</hi>'s Reign; when Informers, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Such a Harmony there was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween these times, and the pernicious Reign of that Master in Cruelty and Dissimulation, <hi>Tiberius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Roguery being discovered, while <hi>Fitzharris</hi> thought to have put <hi>Everard</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this <hi>Dilemma,</hi> either to hang, or prove the Libel upon others, he came to run him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self into the Noose. Lord! into what an Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it put the King, the Duke his dear Brother, and their then juggling Instruments! that the King, who a little before was so overjoyed with the accompt of the Contrivance, which was given him at <hi>White-hall,</hi> that he could hardly contain himself from displaying the Raptures of his Soul, was now so highly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed against <hi>Fitzharris,</hi> that he was heard to say, <hi>He should die, if there were no more Men in</hi> England. But his Confession to the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:62803:67"/>
               <hi>Recorder,</hi> Sir <hi>George Treby,</hi> and others, what the design of the Conspiracy was, that is to say, to thrust papers into the pockets and Lodgings of such and such Gentlemen, and then to seize them with the papers about them; so enraged his Employers, that he was presently lockt up in the <hi>Tower,</hi> out of the reach of all Men, but the Lieutenant, to damn him for spoiling so hopeful a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign; and Secretary <hi>Ienkins,</hi> who was only admitted to him, either to threaten or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jole him with fair promises into a Recanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But above all things, there was such a dread among the Conspirators, lest the Parliament should come to the knowledge of the depth of the Design, that their resolute insisting to have the Cognizance of the Crime within their own jurisdiction, was the occasion of their sudden Dissolution. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which, a Chief Justice was exalted on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, to hang <hi>Fitzharris</hi> out of the way, to prevent his farther discovery, though the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting of <hi>Fitzharris</hi>'s Impeachment by the Lords, was a thing so new and unusual, as to the Proceedings of Parliament, that the Commons, who knew the Law, as well as the Judges, voted it a Denial of Justice, and that no Inferior Court should dare to try an Offender by them impeach'd. But the Judges over-ruling the Law, and the Court over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:62803:67"/>
the Judges, no sooner was the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Dissolved, but <hi>Fitzharris</hi> was Hanged, and by that means many a Mystery of Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty concealed.</p>
            <p>The dissolution of this and the foregoing Parliament was justified by a Declaration in the King's Name, which being published with all the severity and reproach that could be cast upon those worthy Patriots, verified the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of what the King had been heard to say, That <hi>he would make the name of Parliaments to be forgotten in</hi> England.</p>
            <p>However, the Parliament being blown up, and the King running away in a pretended pannick fear from <hi>Oxford,</hi> to colour the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing projects of Plotting and Subornation, no sooner was he settled again at <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Fitzharris</hi> Hang'd to the great joy of those that adored him before, but the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zett</hi> was cram'd with Addresses from all parts of the Nation, to thank the King for his expressions and promises to Govern by Law, which was no more than his Duty: But those Addresses were only signed by the unthinking, loose, and rascally part of the people, who were not sensible of the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief which was thereby intended, which was, to make the Nation out of Love with Parliaments, thereby to unhinge the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and to introduce Tyranny and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:62803:68"/>
Arbitrary Power. And that th Addressorse were only the <hi>Canaille</hi> of the Kingdom, with only a Tool of Quality at the Head of them, the Conspirators well knew; which was the reason they never durst adventure to call any more Parliaments upon the Credit of their Addresses, notwithstanding the mighty brags of their Number and Reputation in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>
            <p>As for the Tryal of <hi>Fitzharris,</hi> I shall say nothing of it, as being already in Print. Only this is to be observed by the way, That no Attorney or Sollicitor-General durst have been so officious, as to go to the Grand-Jury themselves, make fine Speeches to the Jury, and sollicit the finding of the Bill, had they not been encouraged to do what they did by Men of highest Authority in the Nation: Nevertheless the Jury would not proceed without the Opinion of the King's Bench, which was, That they must find the Bill, without taking notice of the Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For which the Valour of the C. J. being highly applauded at Court, was suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to let the World know what sort of Justice influenced the Court: And which might also be as well farther discerned by the Judges over-ruling the weighty Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Fitzharris</hi>'s Councel in behalf of his <hi>Plea,</hi> tho the most Learned Lawyers in
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:62803:68"/>
the Nation, without giving any Reason at all for what they did.</p>
            <p>Nor was it less observable what care and industry was used at Court, after they had got <hi>Fitzharris</hi> condemned, and under the terrour of Death, to make him disown his Confession in <hi>Newgate,</hi> and accuse Sir <hi>G. Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,</hi> Sir <hi>R. Clayton,</hi> and the Sheriffs, of forcing the Information from him; and to lay the Libel to the Lord <hi>Howard:</hi> And for this, they could find out no other Instrument but one <hi>H — s,</hi> who was said to be a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist,</hi> and Chaplain to the <hi>French</hi> Dutchess. But the hard Case was this, That when they had got him, in hopes of his Life, to retract all that they desired, yet he must be hanged at last; though, for fear he should again, when he saw himself deluded, make a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Recantation, he was buoyed up with as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surances of Pardon, till the very moment of his being turned off the Ladder. For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Conspirators pretended, they never designed his Pardon, but only to get a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation from him; and after he was hang'd, to make it publick in print, on purpose to cast an <hi>odium</hi> upon Persons of worth and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, and wipe off the Reproach of their Infidelities from themselves. However, <hi>H — s</hi> gave him a Passport to Heaven for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hat he had done: For b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wife, who knew the falshood of her Husband's Recantation, Whether her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, having wronged so many Innocent Gentlemen, could be sav'd, if he went out of the World with such a Lye in his mouth? <hi>H —s</hi> told her, <hi>Yes,</hi> and accordingly did absolve him as well in his Wifes presence, as upon the Cart before he was executed. Though <hi>Fitzharris</hi> not willing to trust to the Doctor's Absolutions, for the ease of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, wrote two Letters, one to his Wife, and another to his Father, discovering the whole mystery of his Recantation; which he gave sealed to the Doctor, by him to be delivered to his Wife; Which the Doctor promised to do, but like a faithless Priest of <hi>Rome,</hi> carried them to <hi>White-hall,</hi> where they were never heard of more. Which may give an occasion to posterity hereafter, among the rest of the Tragedies of this Prince's Reign, to insert this Story, under the Title of the <hi>Trepanner.</hi>

The <hi>Macknamars</hi> were to have, one of them Forty, the other Twenty Shillings a week; <hi>Hains</hi> and <hi>Denis</hi> the same proportion: <hi>Fitzharris</hi>'s Wife had Fifteen pound a month, and her Maid Twenty shillings a week; and the inferiour Scoundrels, such as <hi>Eustace Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mins,</hi> Twelve shillings a week: And for the more convenient defraying of these Expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, it was, That His Majesty was so earnest with the Parliament for Money, under the pretence of Foraign Alliances, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of <hi>Tangier.</hi> What will posterity say, when they shall hear of a Prince ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausting the publick Treasure, to support Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ornation, Perjury, and the Charge of ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Arbitrary Tryals; to cover an Infernal Plot, contrived by Priests and Jesuits, and to which himself was privy, with the Ruins of his Innocent people? For after Ages will need no other proofs to clear their Impartial Judgments, than the fatal consequences of the Bloody Combination: Which being right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly observed, they will find by the eagerness of the chase, how maliciously and industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously these Blood-hounds hunted after Blood, and how closely they pursued their Innocent Game, till they had driven them into the Pit of Perdition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Colledg</hi>'s Tryal is too well known to be here repeated; but after Ages will observe,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:62803:70"/>
how he was removed from <hi>London,</hi> where he had been acquitted, to another remote Countrey, where his Prosecutors were as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured of his Destruction, by deluded Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and partial Knavery; how he was accused, and testified against by <hi>Naboth</hi>'s Evidence, the scandal and reproach of all mankind, whose Memories stink upon the Earth, and would soon be forgotten, but that their Names are made use of to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Infamy of their Employers to poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. They will observe, not only how he had been long barricadoed up from all Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; but how his Pockets were ransacked of all the Papers conveyed to him just before his Tryal, on purpose to deprive him of all helps to make his Justification; how he was denied the Pannel of the Jury, and the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of any Friend to stand by him. They will observe, that his Prosecutors were in great want of Evidence against him, when they were forced to rake the Goals for Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creants to Swear against him; and give from thence a shrewd conjecture of the sufficiency of their Testimony. They will observe how eagerly and vehemently the King's Councel laboured the Prisoner's downfall, as if they had been to have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited their Places, had he been acquitted. All which severities were palpable demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:62803:71"/>
of that Innocent Man's being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to Destruction, right or wrong, on purpose to lay the foundation of farther Butch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eries.</p>
            <p>So that being fleshed by this Success, the next attempt of the King's Justice, was upon the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> for the same pretended Treason for which <hi>Colledge</hi> had suffered. And here posterity will make the same Observations and Conclusions in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, as in <hi>Colledge</hi>'s Case: But more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly will after Ages easily conclude from hence, that it was not for any Contrivance of his Lordship, but by a project of Court and <hi>Popish</hi> Revenge, to destroy a person, who by his Courage, Wisdom, and Good Intelligence, had Opposed and Defeated so many of their Designs against the Religion and Welfare of the Nation. For that this Plot upon his Lordship was so early Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to <hi>Rome</hi> and other Foreign parts, That it was talked of at <hi>Paris,</hi> and in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> some time before his Lordship was Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned in <hi>England.</hi> They will observe the Injustice done his Lordship, in refusing to let him see or know the persons that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed against him, which was not denied ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>Coleman,</hi> or the <hi>Iesuites</hi>; and which being so contrary to Law, was a plain De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration, that either the Witnesses were
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:62803:71"/>
not thought of credit sufficient to support the Confinement of so great a Peer; or else that it was not convenient to trust the general course of their Lives to be scrutinied too soon. They will admire at the horrid Injustice done his Lordship, in refusing to give an Oath to those that offered to have sworn two Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Subornation against the False Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies produced against his Lordship; The first president of such an Illegal Obstruction of Justice.</p>
            <p>They will observe the Treachery that was used to have betrayed his Lordship into the Snare. For what greater piece of Treachery could there be, than after they had intercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Letter directed to his Lordship out of <hi>France,</hi> from a Gentleman that had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a Regiment of Horse in the Service of <hi>C.</hi> the I. which Letter was only to desire his Lordship, to befriend him with a Receipt of the Gout, they added to it a Postscript, wherein the Gentleman is made to tell his Lordship, <hi>That he was able to furnish him with Forty Thousand Men from</hi> France, to oppose the D. of <hi>York:</hi> and so sent it back again into <hi>France,</hi> to have been returned into <hi>England,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted a second time, but that by a strange providence the Letter happened into the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's own hands, who was not a little consternated at the alteration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:62803:72"/>The Motives that induced the Court to begin with this Great and Eminent Peer, will be easily discernible to succeeding A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. For to what man of Sense and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, is it not apparent, that it was the Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Court, That their Revenge against this Earl should not be adjourned, till they had tried the Credit of their Witnesses upon other considerable Persons, for fear lest by his Lordship's Industry and Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, he should not only have detected and exposed the whole Intreague, but have bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Engine, by which the two Brothers thought to have made themselves Absolute Lords of the Laws and Religion of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. For which reason, it was thought best to assault him, by way of surprise, and to hurry him to prison, upon a pretended Conspiracy, which People would be asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished at, but not have time to unravel. For the King and his Brother were assured, That the convicting of the E. of <hi>Shaf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sbury</hi> upon a Charge of Levying War, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiring to seize his Person, would be a kind of moral proof against every other Person whom they had a mind to accuse of the same Crime. Since people would be easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded, That a Person of his prudence and conduct, would not easily embark himself in such a dangerous Enterprise, without a
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:62803:72"/>
proportionable number of persons, who by their Power, Quality, and Interest, might be supposed to be able to carry it on. So that all the Noblemen and Gentlemen of <hi>England,</hi> that ever had any Converse or Acquaintance with the Earl, supposing them to be persons obnoxious to the Court, were involved in his Ruine.</p>
            <p>But it will remain an Eternal Monument of Reproach upon Royal Subornation, That after all the Industry of the Court, and their obsequious Instruments, after all their lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their heads together, to form cohering and probable Proofs of the charge intended to be laid against him, after an Illegal Trick devised to have Tryed him within their own Jurisdiction of the <hi>Verge</hi>; which was so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Law, that it was exploded by their own <hi>Bene placito</hi> Lambskin men; that at length he was acquitted by a Grand Jury, the most Substantial for Estates, Integrity, and Soundness of Judgment, that had been returned for many years in the City, to the never dying praise of the two Sheriffs, Mr. <hi>Pilkington</hi> and Mr. <hi>Shute.</hi> A Disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, which so incensed the King and his Dear Brother, That they resolved to make an <hi>Islington</hi> Village of the Chief <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis</hi> of the whole Nation; and what they could not do by Fire, to effect by wresting
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:62803:73"/>
from them their Franchises and Privileges, far more Ancient than the descent of those that wrested them for a time out of their hands. For this Reason, the Attorney Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral was ordered to bring a <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> against the <hi>City Charter,</hi> under the pretence of their Petitioning for the Sitting of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; a thing so far from being a Crime, that it was the undoubted Right of the Nation. And yet such was the awe, which the Antiquity and Legality of the Charter had upon the Judges, that the Fountain of Justice was forc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d to shift his Chief Justice, till he could fix upon one that durst adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to pronounce Sentence against it. Which as it was the greatest Invasion that could be against the Ancient and Fundamental Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions of the Kingdom, so it plainly laid open the King's Pious intentions of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Law, which according to the new Interpretation of the Court, was the down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Subverting all that was most Sacred and Valuable in the Nation. For what was all this Bustle for? But as Charters of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cities and Corporations were chopt and changed throughout the Nation, to the end the King might have it in his power to violate the electing of a Parliament, and nominate and obtrude upon all Persons of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, his own Slaves and Creatures, <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,</hi>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:62803:73"/>
and Traytors to their Countrey; so by reducing one of the most Ancient Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and levelling it with one of the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Villages in the Kingdom, that he might command the Mayor and Sheriffs, and by their means the Juries of the City, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to have the Lives of all his <hi>Protestant</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects at his mercy.</p>
            <p>And that this was his end, was apparent by the Consequences; for when once the King by the overthrow of the Charter, had made sure of his own Sheriffs and Juries; Heavens! how were the Laws of God and the Kingdom wrested by misinterpretation! how were the Precepts even of Morality it self transvers'd; the Witnesses for the King caressed and countenanced in their known Subornations; the Testimonies for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Criminals brow-beaten and run down, and all the Arguments of Law and Reason, urged by the most Learned Council of the Nation, over-ruled by Hectoring and Swag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering Judges, to take away the Lives of the Lord <hi>Russel,</hi> Coll. <hi>Sidney, Armstrong, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish,</hi> and several others, merely to gratify the Rage of <hi>Popish</hi> Revenge. Such were the Violences of the Court at that time, in the defiance of Justice, as if all fear of giving account to future Parliaments, had been thrown off, or that they never intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:62803:74"/>
to be troubled with them more, till they had framed the Nation into such a posture, as to chuse such Members as would not only forgive such Villanies, but go sharers with them in the Spoil of the Kingdom. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the eager Thirst of all the Great Men at <hi>White-hall,</hi> was so apparent, that nothing could be more, by the violent Contests for Sheriffs fit for their Turns, before they were Masters of the Charter; insomuch, that they laboured it with that Zeal, as if they had been contending <hi>pro Aris &amp; Focis</hi>; and some of them were heard to say, That upon that hung all their hopes; and without it they were undone. For by the Verdicts of such Juries that such Sheriffs should return, they were in hopes to cut off all that in their Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had appeared for the Exclusion of the Duke, or had shewed their constant Zeal for the <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion, and the Laws of the Land; which is easily demonstrable from the Catalogues of those that suffered, or were forced to shelter themselves in Foreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries from the Malice of their Revengeful Prosecutors. Nor was it less remarkable, that as all along they embarked themselves in Designs pernicious and destructive to the King and Kingdom; So that the structure of this was built upon as wicked a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was evident from the Instruments se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:62803:74"/>
and encouraged by the favour of the King and his Brother, to promote it. For as they made use of the Scum of the World to perjure men out of their lives; so they made use of the Scum of the City, such as <hi>Dodson, Masters, Cradock, Mern,</hi> and others of the same stamp, to give them the command of Juries proper to complete the Tragedies. A most ready and clever way to extirpate by degrees, the Patriots of our Religion and Liberties. But that this was the Design of getting Court-Sheriffs, Sir <hi>G. Iefferies,</hi> who well knew the minds of his Superiors at <hi>White-hall,</hi> was neither afraid nor ashamed to own. For having after the Tryal of Sir <hi>Patience Ward,</hi> desir'd him to give his Worship a Meeting at Sir <hi>Robert Claytons</hi>; he there told him after an insulting manner, <hi>That he had satisfied his Revenge for the Loss of the</hi> Recordership; <hi>and besides, that having such Sheriffs as they desir'd, they had now the Law in their hands, and could have the Life of whomsoever they pleas'd.</hi> Otherwise it had been impossible, but for the Treachery of the Judges that encouraged the Injustice of a packed <hi>Iury,</hi> to have found the Lord <hi>Russel</hi> guilty of death, when the whole of what was villanously sworn against him, was in the opinion of far more honest, and equally Learned Lawyers, but Mispri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:62803:75"/>
of Treason; or to have convicted Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Sydney</hi> upon <hi>Innuendo's,</hi> made out of old Papers found in his Study, and never published.</p>
            <p>But then follow'd the barbarous and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Murther of the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> which how far it could be laid to the King's Charge, is somewhat as yet in the dark. However, that the King could find no other Morning to accompany his Brother to the <hi>Tower,</hi> but that very Morning that the Earl was mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd, will no doubt very much augment the Suspicion of future Ages; and it will be as odly look'd upon, that when Letters and Proposals were sent to some Great Persons near the King, That if His Majesty would but grant a Pardon to two or three Men that should be nam'd when the Favour was granted, the whole Mystery of the Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance should be discovered, and the Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and Actors be particularly detected; such a Proposal should be slghted and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected.</p>
            <p>There was also another Letter, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same Offers, addressed to the Countess of <hi>Essex,</hi> and sent open to one <hi>Cademan,</hi> a Bookseller in the <hi>New-Exchange,</hi> which was also carried to one of the Secretary's; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all which, there was not the least syllable published to encourage any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:62803:75"/>
after that Nobleman's Blood; which as it amazed all rational people at that time, so it will reflect upon the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and his memory to all succeeding Ages.</p>
            <p>Now, after all these Tricks and Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems of the King, to introduce Tyranny and Slavery, to stifle the <hi>Popish-Plot,</hi> by throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it upon his <hi>Protestant</hi> Subjects; after such an obstinate and stedfast Conjunction with the sworn Enemy of the Nation, the <hi>French</hi> King, for the Subversion of our Laws, Liberties and Religion; after so many Slights and Contempts to put upon the Grand Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of the Kingdom, which he never Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, but to empty and drain the Purses of the Nation; so that there was not a Law which he consented to for the publick Good, not a gracious Speech or Declaration to protect and preserve the <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion, which the people did not purchase at a dear rate, while the Dissenters, among the rest, paid for the very Thorns and Briars that tore their own Backs; all this designed on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to render the Name of Parliaments odious; and lastly, a League concluded with the <hi>French</hi> King, for their total Subversion. After so many Bloody Executions of the chiefest Patriots, and constant Assertors of the <hi>Protestant</hi> Faith, to believe the King,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:62803:76"/>
by whose Authority, and by whose Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and Permission all this was done, to be that sincere <hi>Protestant</hi> which he profest himself to be, is for a Man to shut the Windows of his Understanding against the Light of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Reason.</p>
            <p>But to shut the Door against all Objections that can be made in his behalf; there is one proof yet remaining behind, which must be an undeniable Convincement to all the World, of the truth of what has been hitherto said, as standing still recorded under his own Hand, if the Original of the Instructions be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, and that is the following Memorial of his Ambassador to the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> in the year 1667.</p>

            <p>If this be not enough to discover his Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and the whole drift of his Intrigue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Reign, there can be nothing sharp enough to penetrate the stupid and besot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Bigotry of those that stand up in his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification. But notwithstanding the wilful Blindness of such People, it is to be hoped, that other Men less biassed, and having the same just pretences to common Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, have a greater value for their Reason, than to forfeit it to Prejudice, and an Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, now exploded by all the sober part of the World: And having once disintangled their Judgments from the Incumbrances of <hi>Iure Divino Nonsence,</hi> they will then find, that the whole Course of his Reign, was no more than what this Memorial discovers; and that the frequent Breaches of his Word and Promises, both to his Parliaments and People, were but the Effects of the Religion he profess'd and own'd in his Ambassadors's Memorial; one of the chief Principles of which it is, Not to Keep Faith with Hereticks; and by which, he was obliged to be more faithful to the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> than the King

            <p>As for the Covenant, whathever the Oath were, it matters not here to dispute; but they who were Witnesses of his taking it, observed, that if ever he seem'd Sincere in what he did, it was in binding his Soul by that solemn Oath; and yet he not only openly and avowedly broke it, but caused it to be burnt in all the three Nations, by the Hands of the Common Hangman.

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:62803:78"/>
former Carriages and Actions in following the Advice, and walking in the way of those who are opposite to the Covenant, and the Work of God, and might excuse his delaying to give Satisfaction to the just and necessary Desires of the Church and Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> from his Education and Age, and from his Evil Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel and Company; yet knowing he hath to do with God, he doth ingenuously acknowledg all his own Sins, and all the Sins of his Father's House, craving Pardon, and hoping for Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Reconciliation through the Blood of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ.</p>
                  <p>And his Majesty having upon full Persuasion of the Iustice and Equity of all the Heads and Articles thereof, sworn and subscribed the National Covenant of the Kingdom of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the Solemn League and Covenant of the three Kingdoms of <hi>Scotland, England,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> does declare, That he has not sworn and subscribed these Covenants, and entred into the Oath of God, and his People, upon any sini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Intention, or crooked Design for obtainings his own Ends: but as far as humane Weakness will permit, in the Truth and Sincerity of hie Heart. And that he is firmly resolved, in thd strength of the Lord, to adhere thereto, ane to prosecute to the utmost of his Power all the Ends thereof, in his Station and Calling, really, constantly, and sincerely, all the days of his Life.</p>

               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:62803:79"/>After such a solemn Stipulation between Heaven, and the Nation of <hi>Scotland,</hi> no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that he had recourse to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for Absolution. For seeing, that he had such a Confidence of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Power deriv'd to the Pope, there is no other Argument to be urg'd in his behalf, that either he thought there was any Faith to be kept with Man, or that he believed in God. And how far the Breach of this, when we reflect how much he was abandoned to Misfortune, and the Reproach of Infidelity, both at Home and Abroad, pursued him to his Grave, is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the serious Consideration of his Brother, and <hi>Lewis</hi> the 14<hi>th.</hi> But who could rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hope that he should deal sincerely, and above-board with the World, whose whole Course had been to deal thus deceitfully and treacherously with God? He who made it his business to impose upon the All-seeing Eye of the Heavenly Majesty, might easily bear with that Infirmity of his, of not scrupling the deluding Nations, and abusing the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of Mankind. 'Twas his Practice to be a Papist in his Closet, and a Protestant in his Chappel; to be this hour at the Mass, bearing a Part in the <hi>Romish</hi> Ceremonies upon <hi>Christmas-Eve</hi> at <hi>Sommerset-House,</hi> and the next day communicating after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Church of <hi>England</hi> at <hi>White-Hall.</hi>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:62803:79"/>
This the Dutchess of <hi>Cleveland,</hi> well knew, and therefore had been often heard to say, That <hi>She did not embrace the Catholick Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion out of any esteem that she had for it; but because that otherwise she could not continue the King's Mistress:</hi> And consequently Miss of State.</p>
            <p>Add to this his sending the D. of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> with an express Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to reconcile himself there to the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> So that his whole Life may be said to be made up of Contradictions; and that to save others the trouble of char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging him with falshood, he employed his own Tongue in all his publick Speeches and Declarations, to give his own Heart the Lye; and justly merited the Character, which a certain Person gave him, to carry with him to his Grave; That <hi>he was an irreconcileable Enemy of the Protestant-Religion, a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a Virtuous Woman.</hi> But what car'd he, who being put in mind to consider what Infamy the History of his Life and Reign would entail upon his Memory, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, That <hi>he car'd not tho the World made a Whistle of his Tail, when he was dead.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indeed was there any true Zeal for any Religion to be believed in a Man, who coming into the Chamber of a certain Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and finding a <hi>Bible</hi> there, reproached
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:62803:80"/>
the owner for having less wit than he took him to have, since he troubled himself with such a Book.</p>
            <p>But tho he had long trifled with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, his beloved Friends, and indeed had so carried himself, that neither Papist nor Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant could tell what to make of him, yet the Papists resolv'd they would be no longer dallied with by him: And therefore so soon as he had made all things ready for his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Exaltation; after he had prevented his Exclusion from the Throne, and put all the power of his Dominions into his Hands, to give way for him that truly Reign'd while he but only wore the name of King, he was struck with an <hi>Apoplexy,</hi> as it was given out (for let the true Cause be what it will, a Prince always dies of some Disease or other in the Physicians Catalogue) but such were the Circumstances of his Death, that Men began to discover their Suspicions freely to the World, before he was cold. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it were, certain it is, that he was Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved from all his sins by his great Friend <hi>Iohn Huddleston</hi>; and that the Priests gave him extream Unction: At what time, one of his Relations forcing his way into the Room, and seeing them at it, could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear saying, That <hi>now they had Oyl'd and Greas'd his Boots, they had made him fit for
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:62803:80"/>
his Iourney.</hi> And this is yet more remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, That all the while he lay upon his Death-bed, he never spoke to his Brother, to put him in mind of preserving the Laws and Religion of his People; but only recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to him the Charitable care of his two Concubines, <hi>Portsmouth,</hi> and poor <hi>Nelly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor was it a small aggravation of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Suspition, to find him hurried to his Grave with such an ungrateful secrecy in the dead of the Night, as if they had feared the Arresting of his Corps for Debt; not so much as the mean Pomp of the Blewcoat Boys to sing him to Heaven: Insomuch, that he was Buried, by his Brother whom he had so high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obliged, with far less decency than was permitted for the Funeral of his Father, by his capital Enemies that had beheaded him. But that perhaps might be so ordered by Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to signify that he was not worth the publick Lamentation of the People, whose Religion and Liberties he had been always designing to subvert.</p>
            <p>To him succeeded <hi>Iames</hi> the II. not more perniciously designing, but more eargerly bent in the Chase of National Ruin and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction. He came in to <hi>England</hi> full freight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his Mother's Religion, and her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice to the People of the Nation; but wore
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:62803:81"/>

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>st the same Vizard Mask of Protestan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism which his Brother did. But tho he were fitter for the business they both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd, yet he understood not how to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage it so well; so that had he been the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Brother, we may undoubtedly presume to say, he would have been much sooner thrown out of the Saddle, greatly to the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving both the Honour and Treasure of the Nation, and the Life of many a worthy Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and true Lover of his Country.</p>
            <p>'Tis well known, and a thing confirm'd by two Letters yet to be seen, wherein one of the King's own Chaplains, then upon the spot when it was done, imparts and laments it to a Bishop, That <hi>the Duke of</hi> York, <hi>while he was yet but very young, made a solemn Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation of the Protestant Religion, and was reconciled to the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>while he sojourned with his Mother in</hi> France, <hi>in hopes by the assistance of the Papists to have defeated his elder Brother of his Right of Inheritance, tho he had all the Indulgence imaginable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal his Conversion, where it might be for his private Advantage, and the general good of the Cause.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And so early was this Ambition of his to supplant his Elder Brother, That when the <hi>Scots</hi> were treating with the Exil'd King, to restore him to the Throne of <hi>Scotland,</hi> That
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:62803:81"/>
he was at that very time practising with such as remain'd faithful to the King's Title here, that they would renounce his elder Brother, and chuse him for their Soveraign. And for that Reason it was that the Duke forsook him at <hi>Bruxels,</hi> and withdrew into <hi>Holland</hi>; so that the King was necessitated, not only to command him upon his Allegiance to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, but was constrain'd to send the Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> and some other Persons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, as well to threaten as persuade him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would go back.</p>
            <p>And as he was an early Traytor to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, so did he no less treacherously attempt the disowning of his first Wife. For finding her extraordinary Chastity to be such, that he could not be admitted to her Bed, but upon the lawful score of Matrimony, he was at last Married to her, but so very privately, that only the King was privy to it: After which, perceiving that his Brother's Restora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was fully determin'd in <hi>England,</hi> under pretence that it would be more for his own, and the Honour and Interest of his Brother, to Marry with some great Princess that would both enrich and strengthen them by the largeness of her Dowry, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of her Relations, he would have taken an occasion from the privacy of the Nuptials, to deny her being his Wife, and to disavow
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:62803:82"/>
all Contracts and Ceremonies of Marriage between them: But the King detesting so much baseness, as being himself a witness of the Marriage, would not suffer the Lady to be so heinously abused; but constrain'd him, after great reluctancy, to declare it publickly to all the World. A happy Providence for <hi>England,</hi> which by that Conjunction blest us with two Protestant Princesses, matchless in Virtue and Piety, and all those other Graces that adorn their Sex; to the eldest of which we are beholden for our Deliverance from an Inundation of Slavery and Popery, under the Auspicious Conduct of a Soveraign truly meriting the Noble and Ancient Titles of <hi>King of Men,</hi> and <hi>Shepherd of the People,</hi> and the yet more dignified Addition, of <hi>Defender of the Faith.</hi> And from the youngest of which, we have already the earnest of a hopeful Issue to guard us from the like Invasions. Such is the provision of Providence, that many times it happens, the most venomous Creatures carry about them the particular Antidote against their own Poysons.</p>
            <p>Certain it is, that the D. of <hi>York</hi> would never have pull'd off his Protestant Vizour, nor have declar'd himself of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion so soon, had he not been there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to necessitated by a Stratagem of the King his Brother; for the Papists having a long
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:62803:82"/>
time waited for the Accomplishment of the King's Oaths and Promises for restoring their Religion; and having annually contributed large Sums of Money towards the effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, at length grew impatiently sullen, and would advance no more, unless the King or the Duke would openly declare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves for Popery: Which the King thinking no way seasonable for him to do, and not being able by all his Arguments and Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities to prevail with his Brother to do it, he at length bethought himself of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, which was, To get the Queen to write a Letter, intimating her Intention to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw into a Monastry; which Letter was to be left upon her Closet Table, that her Priests, as it was concerted before-hand, might there seize it, and seeing the Contents of it, carry it forthwith to the Duke. Upon which the Duke, being jealous lest the King, upon the Queen's relinquishing her Husband, might be induced to marry again, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by deprive him of the hopes of succeeding, than which there was nothing which he thirsted after more, upon obtaining a previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Assurance, that in case he declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a Papist, she should not withdraw, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately pull'd off his Mask, and renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Communion with the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:62803:83"/>Being thus quit of his fears from the King, his next work was to rid himself of all his Jealousies of the D. of <hi>Monmouth.</hi> To which purpose he lay day and night at the King, to require him to turn <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick. Which the King out of his Tenderness to the <hi>Romish</hi> Cause, as well as to gratifie his Brother, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to do, and accordingly sent him into <hi>France,</hi> with an express Command to reconcile himself to the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> however, the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> out of an aversion to the Fopperies of that Religion, fail'd in his performance. Which so incens'd the D. of <hi>Y.</hi> that from that time forward he studied all the ways imaginable to bring him to Destruction.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, having by his publickly declaring himself a Papist, engag'd all those of the same Religion, to his Person and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, he resolved to drive on, <hi>Iehu</hi>-like, and to promote the Catholick Cause, with all the vigour and swiftness he was able, and to make the utmost use of his Brothers good Intentions. And such was his Bigottry to the <hi>Romish</hi> Church, That according to the Principles of that Religion, he stuck at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>per fas &amp; nefas,</hi> to bring about his Popish Designs.</p>
            <p>I shall not here dilate upon his secret Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations at <hi>Rome,</hi> his Correspondencies
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:62803:83"/>
with Foreign Priests and Jesuites, or his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Intrigues with the <hi>French</hi> King, which have been all sufficiently exposed already in Print; as for that whatever has been already said of the King, is also to be said of him in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, while he was Duke, in regard they both drew in the same Yoak, for the Ruine of the Nation. For this is as certain as the rest, that he had a most eager desire to Rule, and Rule Despotically, which was the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son he was frequently heard to say, <hi>He had rather Reign one Month as the King of</hi> France, <hi>than Twenty Years as his Brother the King of</hi> England, <hi>did.</hi> And besides, it was as plain, That he had a mortal Antipathy against the Protestant Religion, and more particularly against the Professors of it in <hi>England</hi>; but more especially the Dissenters, upon the score of Revenging his Father's Death. An Imbitter'd Hatred, which he deriv'd from his Mother, who mortally malic'd <hi>England</hi> upon the same Account, and which he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd in his <hi>Bedchamber</hi> at St. <hi>Iames's,</hi> where he openly declar'd; That he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd to be reveng'd upon the <hi>English</hi> Nation for his Father's Death. Which if those un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking People, who are so eager to have him again, would but consider, they would not be so forward for his return. For it is in vain for the Church of <hi>England</hi>-Men, of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:62803:84"/>
what degree soever, to think that their refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to Swear Allegiance to King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> would excuse them from that universal Revenge which he would take upon the Nation, were it ever again in his Power.</p>
            <p>Only here was the Difference between the two Brothers, That the King thought to Ruin his Enemy by main Force, and the fair hand of Victory; but the Duke hoping to kill two Birds with one Stone, made it his Business at the same time to Ruin the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my by Force, and his own Country by Treachery. Thus when he had engag'd his Brother in the First Holy <hi>Dutch</hi> War of the Extirpation of Hereticks, he permits the <hi>English</hi> at first to exercise all the Bravery of their Skill and Courage to a great Probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Success; but then falls asleep in the height of his Conduct, to the end the <hi>Dutch</hi> for want of Orders might have an Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to wrest the Victory out of the Hands of the <hi>English,</hi> on purpose to keep the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of Destruction on both sides even. Thus he permitted himself to be surpris'd at <hi>Soul-Bay,</hi> knowing there were enough to Maul the Enemy, but not enough to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve those that Fought on our side. So that the <hi>Dutch</hi> may be said to be well Thrash'd, and the <hi>English</hi> to be well Sacrific'd. And as a farther Demonstration of his Perfidious
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:62803:84"/>
Soul, when he found the Contest would be too tedious between two Nations so well match'd, it was the Duke's Contrivance to Suborn and Bribe two Indigent and Desperate Villains, to go over and Fire the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships as they lay in their Harbours; and when he had done that, it was the same Treachery, that with a sham Story lull'd his Brother asleep, and procur'd the Firing of our Ships at <hi>Chatham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Burning of <hi>London</hi> was such a match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Piece, as could not have enter'd into the Breast of any but a Bejesuited <hi>Herostratus,</hi> in hopes to purchase the infamous immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of a Popish <hi>Saintship,</hi> by reducing to Ashes, the greatest Bulwark and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazin of the Protestant Religion in <hi>Europe. Rome</hi> was set on Fire by <hi>Nero,</hi> to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>built it again more Glorious, and that he might have space enough for one of the most sumptuous Palaces so design'd, under the Sun; thereby to have made the Mistress of the Earth, the wonder of the World: But <hi>London</hi> was fired, not only to destroy the Wealth and Habitations of the City, never to have risen more, but with an intention to extirpate the Inhabitants themselves to boot, and to have turn'd the Venerable and Spaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Pile into a depopulated Wilderness, by a general Massacre of the People, under the Consternation of the spreading Flames. The
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:62803:85"/>
standing Streets provided and furnished with Incendiaries with fresh Materials to revive and restore the weary Conflagration; and when taken in the Act, rescued out of the Hands of those that seized them, and sent to St. <hi>Iames</hi>'s, to be there secured from the Rage of the Multitude, and then dismist without Prosecution. An excellent way to have made all sure, by mixing the Blood of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants with the Ashes of their Dwellings, the only Cement which the Papists believed would fastest bind the Fabrick of the <hi>Romish</hi> Church. And what greater piece of Perfidie could there be, than while the D. was riding about the Streets under pretence of assisting to quench the Fire, that his Guards were at the same time employed to prevent the People from removing their Goods; and his Palace made the Refuge of such as were taken in the very fact of cherishing and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting the Flames! This the Committee of Parliament trac'd so far, that it cost the Life of the poor Gentleman that gave the Information of these Things to the Chair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the Committee, to prevent any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Discovery, and secure the D. from the Danger of his Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Coleman</hi>'s crying out, <hi>There was no Faith in Man,</hi> was a most undeniable Testimony of the Treachery of his Master, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:62803:85"/>
all the faithful Service he had done him; and was it not a Magnanimous and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Act of a Prince, to betray, as he did, to the Gallows, not only his most trusty Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, but his Fellow-Partner in the Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy?</p>
            <p>More inhumane still, was the Barbarous Murder actually contriv'd and brought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, by the encourag'd Instruments of the Duke. For he it was that sent word to <hi>Coleman,</hi> to bid him take no care, for that Sir <hi>Edmond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury Godfrey</hi> should be remov'd out of the way; and at the same time took the like care that his Servant <hi>Coleman</hi> should follow him. For it was Detection that he feared, and the Duke well knew that the Dead could never tell Tales. The Particulars of the Murder, and how far the Circumstances of it reached the Duke, are too fresh in Memory to be here inserted; and Dispensation for Deeds of the blackest hew were so easily obtained, that it was no wonder the Duke so little bog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled at a single Murder, to conceal the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs of general Massacres, wherein he was engag'd.</p>
            <p>In pursuance of which, he was no less in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious to bring the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and all the <hi>Dissenting Protestants,</hi> within the Snare of his Sham-plot, in order to the Destruction of thousands of Innocent Persons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:62803:86"/>This <hi>Dangerfield</hi> discovered to the World, and his Informations taken upon Oath, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Sir <hi>William Roberts,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Poultney,</hi> are extant, wherein he gives an Account of his being introduced several times into the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s Presence. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, that being, once among the rest, admitted to the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s Closet at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> he kissed his Hand upon his Knees: And then being taken up by the Duke, he gave him a little Book, containing the whole Scheme of the <hi>Presbyterian Plot,</hi> for which the Duke thank'd him, as also for his diligence in the Catholick Cause, and wishing good Success to his Undertakings; Added these words; <hi>That the Presbyterian Plot was a thing of most mighty Consequence, and I do not question, but the Effects of it will answer our Expectation; especially, in the Northern Parts, where I am well assur'd, the major Part of the Gentry are my Friends, and have given sufficient Demonstrations to me, as also of their Intentions to prosecute this Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Plot, for they are no strangers to the Design.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the same time, he ordered <hi>Dangerfield</hi> to be very careful of what he communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Persons who were to be the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses in that new Plot, lest he should be caught in the Subornation, and so bring
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:62803:86"/>
a terrible Odium upon the Catholicks, and make himself uncapable of any further Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
            <p>Then for Encouragement in the prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sham-Plot, the Duke promis'd, that he would take care that Mony should not be wanting, and ordered him, with all the Expedition the Thing would allow, to make a Discovery of it to the King. At the same time, the Duke also made divers Vows, and bitter Execrations, to stand by him in the Thing, and engaged upon his Honour, to be his Rewarder; and, in Earnest, gave him Twenty Guinies with his own Hand; and telling him withal, what a great Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he had gained among the Catholicks; and that in a short time he should see the Catholick Religion flourish in these King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms; with a great deal more to the same purpose.</p>
            <p>Of the truth of which, among many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, there could not be a more convincing Proof, than the bitter Enmity which the Duke bore to <hi>Dangerfield</hi> after his Discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and the severe Usage which he receiv'd from <hi>Iefferies,</hi> the Duke's Creature, and the Rhadamantine Dispenser of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venges.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Scotland</hi> he Rul'd, or rather Reign'd, tho in his Brother's Life-time, with a more
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:62803:87"/>
Arbitrary and Lawless Controul. And there it was that he breath'd forth his Venome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Protestants, utter'd his Tyrannous Maximes with more freedom, and exercis'd his Tyranny with a more boundless and exorbitant Extravagance. For there it was, that he first undertook to exercise the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Sovereign Rule, refusing to take the Oath of High Commissioner, which the Law of the Country requir'd, as here he had denied to take the Test; and to shew how he intended to govern <hi>England,</hi> when it came to his turn, there it was, that in the hearing of Persons of great Credit, he had this worthy Apothegm, <hi>That tho in</hi> England <hi>the Lawyers rul'd the Court, yet in</hi> Scotland <hi>he would rule the Lawyers.</hi> There it was, that he positively denied to give the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment any security for the Preservation of their Religion, in case he succeeded to the Crown. And being told of the Terms that the King had offer'd to the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> tho much harder and more disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable than any which they required, he replied, That the King never intended any such Limitations should pass; nor did he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them, but when he knew they would not be accepted. And farther, to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate his imbitter'd hatred of the Protestants, and with what Rage and Fury he intended
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:62803:87"/>
to prosecute them, he told several Members of the Parliament, when they were endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to get some Bills to pass for the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of their Religion, in case of a Popish Successor, <hi>That whatever they intended or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared against the Papists, should light upon others.</hi> Which tho it stopt him from taking the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of any new Bills, yet he was so just to his Word in behalf of the Papists, that he pour'd all the Rigor of the Penal Laws against the Papists, upon the Protestants in that Kingdom, under the name of Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, whom he persecuted with that infatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble violence, as if according to his own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, he had fully concluded, That it would never be well with <hi>Scotland,</hi> till all the South-side of <hi>Ferth</hi> were made a Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Field. For indeed that was the true in tent and drift of all his envenom'd Prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of those People, as well in <hi>England</hi> as in <hi>Scotland,</hi> in hopes by so severe an Exaspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, they would have broken out into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Rebellion, and so have given him a fair opportunity to have rooted them from the Earth by the Sword. Which was evident from another Saying of his; for that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving one day given his Opinion of sober Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters, and setting them forth, as he thought in their Colours; he concluded, <hi>That if he might have his Wish, he would have them all
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:62803:88"/>
turn Rebels, and betake themselves to Arms.</hi> Which tho it shew'd his good Will, yet whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were so prudently spoken by a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that had so little either of Courage or Conduct as himself, is a question, unless he thought he could subdue them with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Weapons of the Pope's Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations and Curses: Nor did he at the same time remember, that the heavy oppressions of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Inquisition tore from the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions of the <hi>Spaniard</hi> all the seven United Provinces, notwithstanding all that <hi>D'Alva, Parma,</hi> and <hi>Spinola</hi> could do; tho their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Fame far exceeded his.</p>
            <p>Thus we have seen the extent of his Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity; which we find cooped up within the narrow bounds of Popery. Now for his Morality, which if it signalize it self in any Virtue that celebrates a Great and Glorious Prince, it must be in those two, of Justice and Mercy, which God appropriates most nearly to himself, as the brightest Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his Divinity: But whether the Duke were either Just or Merciful to the E. of <hi>Argyle</hi> will be the Question. This Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman was one of the most Ancient, and one of the most eminent Noblemen in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and a Person of extraordinary endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and, as such a one, had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erv'd the King with his Parts, his Person and Estate,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:62803:88"/>
beyond what most Men of any Degree in the Nation, either had done or were able to perform; but because he would not so far comply with, and oblige the Duke, as to fall in with his Counsels, for the Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Popery, and yield himself an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument to carry on his Designs of Popery and Arbitrary Power, his Head must be-brought to the Block, the Ancient Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his Family must be attainted, and his ample Fortunes be confiscated. To which purpose, a certain Test being fram'd for all the Nobility and Gentry of <hi>Scotland</hi> to take, not excepting all others who were capable of any Office or Employment in the Kingdom, easy enough for the Papists to Swallow, as being Calculated for their peculiar Advantage; but difficult for the Protestants, as being that which strangely confus'd and intangled their Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. However the Earl was not so scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous neither, to avoid all Occasions possible of incurring his <hi>Highnesses</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure, but offer'd to take it, with this Proviso, That he might declare in what sense he was willing to be sworn. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly he did draw up an Explanation of his own meaning; and tho he were allowed to take the Oath according to that Explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was also con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ormable to an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:62803:89"/>
which themselves were forced to make for the satisfaction of the greatest part of the Kingdom, that was dissatisfied in the Oath as well as the Earl; Nay, tho his Lordship did take it according to his own allowed Interpretation, which was so far ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, that he was admitted to take his place in the Council; yet upon a <hi>Capricio</hi> of the Duke's Justice, the matter was call'd in question again; but then such horrid Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons were pick'd out of the Earl's Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he was Arraign'd and Condemn'd to lose his Head; and Execution had been certainly done, had he not made his escape. Nevertheless his whole Estate was seiz'd, he was divested of all his Titles and Dignities; and contrary to the Custom of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, his Coat of Arms was despitefully torn at the Publick Market-Cross of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and his Person hunted after in all places, whither they thought he might be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn, even as far as <hi>Hamburgh.</hi> And yet after all the scrutinies which sober Men have made, the chiefest of the <hi>Scots</hi> Lawyers, that were of unbiassed Principles, could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver find any thing in the Earl's Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but what his indispensible Duty obliged him to, both as a Christian, a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and a Privy-Councellor to the King. But the D. was resolved to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:62803:89"/>
him right or wrong: And therefore being told there was nothing in what the E, of <hi>Argyle</hi> had said or done, which could be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> made a Crime by the Law of the Land; His Highness, out of the great Affection which he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>bore to so true a Protestant <hi>Peer,</hi> was pleas'd to reply, <hi>But may it not be wrested to Treason?</hi> Which was such an Incouragement, that when his Mind was once understood, he wanted not Instruments that labour'd day and night to make that Question subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to the D's impatient Thirst of Revenge, and their own Advancement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or else it might be to signalize his Resolution to <hi>over-rule the Lawyers in</hi> Scotland, had they denied their Submission to his Good Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
            <p>By the same Justice it was that <hi>Blackwood</hi> was Condemn'd, upon a Pretence of having entertain'd upon his Ground certain Persons, who were reported, and said to have been at <hi>Bothwel-Bridg.</hi> And this, although there had been no notice given of their being Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals, or any ways Offenders; nor any Proclamations were issued out against them, by which <hi>Blackwood</hi> could be obliged to take Cognizance of the Circumstances they lay under; And that which aggravated the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice was this, That the Gentleman suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered after a General Act of Indemnity
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:62803:90"/>
granted; and that it was after the Council themselves had for four Years pass'd them by, that either the Persons whom he had reliev'd came to be accus'd, or he to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted upon this account.</p>
            <p>And by the same Justice it was, that Mr. <hi>Robert Bailzie</hi> of <hi>Ierismond,</hi> was Hang'd and Quartered for a Crime of which he had been Impeach'd and Try'd before the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and fin'd six Thousand Pounds Sterling. And all this his Highness did by <hi>over-ruling</hi> the Lawyers of <hi>Scotland</hi>; by which means he had made the Judges and Jury <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>as malicious against the Protestants, and as revengeful a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Asserters of the Liberties of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as himself. Such Exorbitancies of Injustice and Arbitrary Power, that his Brother could never have endur'd in a Subject, had they not been acted all along with his knowledg, and consent, Otherwise, had not the King been strangely infatuated, to believe that whatever his Brother did, was for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of that Cause to which he was so well affected himself, he could never have been so unapprehensive of the Danger he was in, from a Brother so actually in a Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy against his Life: For which Reason he was, by the E. of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> said, to be <hi>a Prince not to be parallel'd in History.</hi> For certainly, besides the early tryal which the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:62803:90"/>
King had of his Ambition beyond-sea, he had a fair warning of the hasty Advances which he made to his Throne in a short time after his Marriage to the Queen: For no sooner was it discover'd the Queen was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely to have any Issue by the King, but he and his Party make Proclamation of it to the World, and that he was the certain Heir.</p>
            <p>He takes his Seat in Parliament as Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> with his Guards about him: He assumes the Princes Lodgings at <hi>White-hall,</hi> his Guards upon the same place, without any interposition between him and the King; so that the King was in his Hands and Power every night. All Offices and Preferments are bestowed upon him, and at his disposition; Not a Bishop made without him. After this he changes his Religion to make a Party, and such a Party, that his Brother must be sure to Dye, and be made away, to make room for him. And for the undeniable proof of all this, at length the Plot breaks out, headed by the Duke, his Interest and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign.</p>
            <p>Plain it was, that where ever he came, he endeavour'd to remove all Obstacles to his intended Designs out of the Way. And therefore some there are who attribute the extremity of the Duke's rigour toward the E.
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:62803:91"/>
of <hi>Argyle,</hi> to the great Authority which the Earl had in the High-lands, and the Awe which he had over the Papists, as being Lord Justiciary in those Parts, and his being able upon any Occasion to check and bridle the Marq. of <hi>Huntly</hi> from attempting the Distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance of the Publick Peace, or the Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of the Protestants. However this is observable, That notwithstanding the height of Severity which was extended to him, there was as much Favour shewn the Lord <hi>Macdonald</hi>; whose invading the Shire of <hi>Argyle</hi> with an Armed Force, merely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was required by the said Earl, as being a Papist, to deliver up his Arms, was never so much as questioned, nor so much as a Reprimand given him for what he did; tho when the Council sent an Herauld to him, to require him to disband his Forces, he caus'd his Coat to be torn from his Back, and sent him back to <hi>Edinburgh</hi> with all the Marks both of Contempt of themselves, and Disgrace to the Publick Officer. But his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was sufficient to atone at that time for his Treason.</p>
            <p>And now the Duke having a standing-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of Five Thousand Foot, and Five Hundred Horse in <hi>Scotland,</hi> at his Devotion, as well as in <hi>England,</hi> and the Parliament, the main Object of his Hatred and his Fear, being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sov'd,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:62803:91"/>
back he returns into <hi>England</hi>; where under the Shelter of his Brother's Authority, he began in a short time to exert his ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannous Disposition, and play the same Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just and Arbitrary Pranks, as he had done in <hi>Scotland</hi>; and because it was not seasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble yet to make use of armed Forces, he set his <hi>Westminster-Hall</hi> Redcoats, like Pioneers before a marching Army, to level the way for Popery and Arbitrary Controul, to march in over the ruin'd Estates, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Bodies of their Opposers. The Judges were his Slaves, the Juries at his Beck; nothing could withstand him; the Law it self grows Lawless, and <hi>Iefferies</hi>-ridden, plays the Debaushee like himself. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, or something in her likeness, Swaggers, Hectors, Whips, Imprisons, Fines, Hangs, Draws and Quarters, and Beheads all that come near her, under the Duke's displeasure. Alderman <hi>Pilkington,</hi> for standing up for the Rights and Liberties of the City, and for refusing to pack a Jury to take away the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s Life, is prosecuted upon a <hi>Scandalum Magnatum,</hi> at the Suit of the Duke, Convicted and Condemn'd in a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict of an Hundred Thousand Pounds. And Sir <hi>Patience Ward,</hi> for offering to confront the suborn'd Witnesses, is Indicted of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, for which he was forced to fly to avoid
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:62803:92"/>
the Infamy of the Pillory; though in all his Dealings so well known to be a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of that Justice and Integrity, that for all the hopes of the Duke, he would not have told an untruth. Sir <hi>Samuel Barnardiston,</hi> for two or three treacherously intercepted Letters to his Friends in the Country, fin'd Ten thousand Pounds; which he was not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to discharge by Quarterly Paiments, but the Estate seiz'd by the Duke's Sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, to the End they might have an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to be more prodigal in the waste of it.</p>
            <p>But his hunting after the Lives, as well as the Estates of other, was more intolerable, and that by the prostituted Testimony of Suborn'd <hi>Irish</hi> Rogues and Vagabonds; and when that would not take the desir'd Effect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the forc'd Evidence of persons ensnar'd and shackl'd under the Terrors of Death, till their drudgery of Swearing was over. Men so fond of Life, that they bought the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Prolongation of a wicked Mortality, at the unhallow'd price of certain and Immortal Infamy. And therefore not knowing how to Die, when they knew not how to Live, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted it a more gainful Happiness to quit the Pardon of Heaven's Tribunal, for the Broad Seal of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:62803:92"/>By this means fell the Virtuous Lord <hi>Rus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,</hi> a Sacrifice to the <hi>Bill of Exclusion,</hi> and the Duke's Revenge; and yet of that inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity to his Country, and untainted course of Life, of whom never any spoke evil, but those that knew no Evil in him; only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was one of those that sought to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Duke from the hopes of Tyranny and Oppression, the Duke was resolv'd to exclude him from the Earth.</p>
            <p>But then comes the Murther of the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi>; for that it was a most Barbarous and inhuman Murther, committed by Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vo's and Bloody Ruffians, set on, hir'd and encourag'd by Potent Malice and Cruelty, the pregnant Circumstances no less corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by Testimonies, wanting only the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of Legal Judicature, has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready so clearly made out, that there is no place left for a hesitating belief. A Truth so conspicuous, as stands in defiance of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculing Pen of <hi>R. L'Estrange</hi> to sham it over with the Buffoonry of his Bantring Acquire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. It cannot be imagin'd, but that so black a Deed of Darkness was carried on by the Contrivers with all the secrecy that could be studied by humane Wit. But never yet was humane Wit so circumspective, but that the most conceal'd of Villanies have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected by strange and little Accidents, which
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:62803:93"/>
all the Foresight of humane Sagacity could never prevent. More especially, after such a curious Inquisition, and so much Labour and Industry, pursuing the Cry of this Innocent Nobleman's Blood. Both the Circumstances and Depositions, besides the Declarations of others ready to depose, are made publick at large to the World. And therefore to omit the long-since sifted and winnoed Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of the Witnesses, that were made use of, to prove the Earl a <hi>Felo de se</hi>; there are three things since discovered, that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a strong Conviction with them, of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sort of Murder, in the new Deposition of <hi>Dorothy Smith,</hi> detecting the Motives, the Author and Contriver, the Resolution taken to murder a Noble Protestant Earl, the Manner concluded, and the Joy of those In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuated Bigots, when the Deed was perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated; and all this over-heard by the Maid, at a Meeting of one <hi>Lover,</hi> and several other Persons, privy to the Plot, in the House of one <hi>Holmes,</hi> whom she then served, a trusty Papist, seated in a by-Corner of the Town, and where they thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, for that Reason, in the greatest Safety in the World.</p>
            <p>This Meeting was nine Days before the Earl's Death, where after they had vomited out their Malice against the Earl, in the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrious
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:62803:93"/>
Terms of Villain and Dog, and laden him with Curses, it was said, That <hi>he knew so much of their Designs, and was so very averse to their Interest, that unless he were taken off, they should never carry them on.</hi> Inducements, which as they had carri'd off Sir <hi>Edmund-Bury Godfrey</hi> before, might be as easily admitted for the Destruction of a more considerable Obstacle; more especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally harboured in the Breasts of Men, that make it peculiar to propagate their Religion by Blood and Massacre.</p>
            <p>Therefore to remove this great Obstruction out of the way, their great Oracle, the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> was consulted; who, after some Meditation, was for Poisoning the Earl: but his Highness being told, that manner of Death would not look well: there was another, who propos'd to his Highness, that he might stabb'd; but that not being approved of neither, at length his Highness concluded, and ordered his Throat should be cut, and promised to be there when it was done.</p>
            <p>To all which, there needs no other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but that the Earl's Throat was cut soon after, and that the Duke was in the <hi>Tower,</hi> separated from the King, and close by the Earl's Lodging, when the Murder was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:62803:94"/>After this, the Maid goes on and deposes, That <hi>three days after the same Persons met in the same House, and declared, That the Cutting the Earl's Throat was concluded on, but that it was to be given out, that he had done it himself, and that if any should deny it, they would take them up, and punish them for it.</hi> All which being spoken as a thing contriv'd before the Fact was done, and verifi'd in every Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular after it was committed, are Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances that would hardly be wrestled with before Impartial Judges, at an <hi>Old-Bayly</hi> Session; where it would be also consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the terrible Prosecution of <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> for making Enquiry into the Murder, came all from <hi>White-Hall,</hi> under the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of Court-Injustice and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>But lastly, The Maid swears, <hi>That the same day the Earl died, the same Persons met again, at her Masters House, and fell a capering about the Room for Ioy; at which time, one of them striking her Master upon the back, cri'd,</hi> The feat was done; <hi>upon which</hi> Holmes <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding, whether the Earls Throat was Cut; the other answer'd,</hi> Yes, <hi>and added withal, That he could not but laugh to think how like a Fool the Earl look'd, when they came to cut his Throat:</hi> whereupon <hi>Holmes</hi> asking whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Highness was there? The other repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:62803:94"/>
               <hi>Yes.</hi> With which agreed the Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of several Souldiers, that about a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an hour before the Earl's Death was discover'd, observ'd the Duke to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from the King; at what time be beck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to two Persons, who coming to him, he sent them to the Earl's Lodging, from whence they return'd smiling, in less than a quarter of an hour, and told him the business was done, as one of them more particularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared; for which particular knowledg of his, he was aterwards sent out of the World.</p>
            <p>Nor was the Information of the Woman less to be heeded, who informs, That <hi>as she was walking, a little before the Earl's death, before his Chamber-window, she heard a very great trampling and bustling in the Earl's cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, saw three or four heads move close to gether, and heard a loud and doleful cry of</hi> Murder. And whereas <hi>Floyd</hi> the Sentinel denied at <hi>Braddon</hi>'s Trial, the letting of any Men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Earl's Lodgings before his Death, yet afterwards with great remorse of Conscience he confessed that he did let in Two of Three Men by the Special Order of <hi>Hawley</hi> the Warder.</p>
            <p>It will be an unaccountable thing to Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that the E. of <hi>S.</hi> should so readily part with his Mony of <hi>Holland,</hi> suspected to be one of the Bloody Ruffians, whenever he
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:62803:95"/>
went or sent fot it, tho a Profligate, at the same time convicted in <hi>Newgate</hi> for Robbery upon the High-way.</p>
            <p>It will also seem as strange, that <hi>Webster,</hi> an Under-Bailiff of St. <hi>Katherines,</hi> and an Indigent Ale-draper, should of a sudden be Master of Five hundred Pounds, at such an unlucky nick of Time, as immediately after the Earl's Murder.</p>
            <p>But I forbear to enlarge any farther upon a Theme already so laboriously discuss'd, and publick to the World. Only this is to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, That it might seem strange, that after the Murder was done, such care should be taken, and such strict command given for conveying the News to the <hi>Old-Baily,</hi> till we hear to what End it was done, by the King's Counsel snapping so quickly at it, as if they had had their Lesson before, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving it with all their Eloquence, to the Destruction of the Lord <hi>Russel.</hi> Nor is it unlikely, that <hi>Iefferies</hi> might be either pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy to the Design in some measure at that time, or else be more fully acquainted with it in order to <hi>Braddon</hi>'s Trial. More especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if it be true, which is confidently repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, That his Lordship being at some Publick Place, where he took an occasion to speak largely in the Praise of the Deceased King; when he had done, <hi>However,</hi> said he, whis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:62803:95"/>
a Gentleman on the Ear, <hi>Had he liv'd six Months longer, we had been all hang'd not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding my Encomiums.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Discovery of which Alteration of the King, by a severe Expression which dropt from his Lips upon reading a Letter from a Lord, who eat his last Meal with the Duke, and wrote the same on his Death-Bed, as it seems to be confirmed by this Saying of <hi>Ieffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> so was it by many concluded to be the occasion of hastning the King's Death. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which, the Opinions of the World are various, and some severe, and bearing hard enough upon his Successor: But in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it is a Mystery, as yet the Embrio of Conjecture, which is only to be matur'd in the Womb of Time, and to be midwiv'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World by future Discovery, we leave it to a higher Scrutiny. The Justice of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven perhaps not minding a present Revenge of his Death, who had not only prevented the Presecution of Noble and Innocent <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sex</hi>'s Blood, but so severely punish'd the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious Enquiry after it. Only this is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be remark'd, that the <hi>Irish</hi> Papists could for some time before, fix upon the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Period of his Reign, and the D. was sent for in haste out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> without any apparent Reason for it; besides that the King's Permission was obtain'd with some Difficulty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:62803:96"/>However, by the violent and tremendous Death of his Brother, he at length arrived at the long-long wish'd for Haven of his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious Desires; and beholds himself mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Pinacle of Royalty, only that his Fall might be the more conspicuous.</p>
            <p>He was no sooner Proclaimed, but he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared his Religion openly to his Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; however, he began with a mild and caressing Declaration, which he afterwards broke in every Line of it: A meer Trap baited with Indulgence to Tender Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, on purpose to catch the Dissenting Mice, to deliver them, when caught, into the Paws of his ravenous Popish Cats; but no sooner was he Crowned, but as if his Coronation-Oath, and all his Promises so lately made, had been no more than so many Pills of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium,</hi> and believing himself environed with Power sufficient to maintain his Tyranny and Oppression, he invades Property, by Expulsion of the right Owners; tramples upon the Laws by his pretended Prerogative of Suspending Power, and goes about to pull down the Stately Structure of the Protestant Religion, by the Suspension of one, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoning and Arraigning at his Criminal Bar, no less than Seven of the most Eminent Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the <hi>English</hi> Church. And by a strange Alteration of the Face of Government, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:62803:96"/>
over-rules the Law, and Traitors im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached, are fetched out of Jail to sit Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphantly dominering at the Helm of State; and <hi>Iefferies,</hi> the <hi>Daniel</hi> that in some measure might be said to be taken out of the Lions Den, for the Cruelty of his Nature, is advanced in open Hostility to Justice, to wage War with the Fundamental Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Kingdom: A mean Spirit, insult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over his Inferiors, but a Spaniel to his Superiors; who tho he knew himself no more than a Tool in the hand of the Popish Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers; the Shadow of Grandeur, lofty un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Contempt, and domineering only in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick; yet having pawn'd his Soul for the hopes of an Embroidered Purse, rather than recoil to Goodness, carreers on in Mischief, and as if his Robes had not been Scarlet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, dies them more deep in Innocent Blood, and becomes his Master's Vassal, to enslave the Nation. Such Counsellors as these hurried on the New Crown'd King with such a Rapidness, to accomplish the great Work of introducing Tyranny and Popery, to which his own Fears of leaving the Papists worse than he found them, as furiously carried him, that he threw his Brother into his Grave as if he had not had leisure to bury him; or as if he had deem'd him not worth a Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, whom he thought not worth a longer
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:62803:97"/>
Life: Unless perhaps he thought the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie of Pompous Obsequies, would have but the more provok'd his Brother's Injur'd <hi>Manes,</hi> with which, as common Fame had spread it, he was already too much pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred. I will not here dispute the Truth of Apparitions, nor insist upon the vulgar cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures about the Town upon the Priests, for not detaining him in the half-way-Prison, but singing him out of Purgatory to make his Brother melancholy, by facing him several times, and giving him an astonishing stroke upon the back, as he was going down a pair of Stairs in <hi>Whitehal</hi>; yet this may be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted, That Guilt accompanied with Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, forms those Apparitions in in the Mind, which work the same Effect, and obtain the same belief, when once divulg'd among the Credulous, as if they were real: However it were, it shew'd he thought himself but little beholding to him for living so long, and consequently no way oblig'd to retaliate a Succession so late in the Year, with so much Loss of Time.</p>
            <p>And now the first influences of his Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and Fury against the Protestants, flew into <hi>Scotland,</hi> where whatever Indulgence he shewed in <hi>England,</hi> he issued forth a Dreadful Proclamation against the <hi>Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> under the Notion of Enemies to the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:62803:97"/>
King and Government, and Destroyers of the <hi>British Monarchy</hi>; sufficient to have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a more early Alarm to the Dissenters in <hi>England,</hi> had they not been lull'd asleep by the Softness of a present Repose, and the Charms of their Decoy-Duke, <hi>Penn</hi>; the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect rather of their Simplicity than their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy.</p>
            <p>But the first Act of his Revenge in <hi>England,</hi> brake forth upon Dr. <hi>Oates</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He could not forget the Doctor's detection of his Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies against the Kingdom: And because he could not find out a way to hang him; his <hi>Chief Iustice Iefferies</hi> found out a Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to gratify his Royal Fury, worse than Death it self, and till then unknown among <hi>Christians,</hi> in Imitation of the Roman <hi>Fustu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arium,</hi> by which the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers were often drub'd to Death, or if they scap'd, sent into perpetual Banishment: as the Doctor was first of all Scourg'd by the Common Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner beyond all Precedent, and then Condemn'd to perpetual Imprisonment. A Sentence so void of all Christian Compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that only <hi>Iefferies</hi> could have invented, and such a Beast as <hi>Withens</hi> could have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced. A goodly sight to see Protestant Judges condemning a Protestant, and the Detector of a most Horrid Popish Plot, upon the Evidence of known Papists, and
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:62803:98"/>
some of them nearly Related to the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Traytors, and this for Perjury too, upon the Testimony of Witnesses already falsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd. As if Justice were a thing that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had been Naturaliz'd in Heaven, but only depended upon the Will of the Prince, a Kind of Tool to be us'd by his <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne-placito</hi> Slaves, at his or their Discretion, or the grand Poppet of the World, to be shew'd in various Dre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ses and Disguises, as the force of Judicature requir'd. But as for <hi>Dangerfield,</hi> he had been once his Darling, frequently admitted to kiss his Hand, while he was in Conspiracy with him to Suck the Blood of the Innocent. But there was no Atonement for his revolting, and revealing the Hidden Mystery of Iniquity. Therefore he must dance the same Dance that <hi>Oates</hi> had done; only the King did him this small Piece of Justice, to throw away an Inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> to Satisfy the general Discontent upon his being Murder'd.</p>
            <p>In the next place he calls a Parliament, and renews his Assurances and Promises to preserve the Government both in Church and State, as by Law Establish'd; and Vows to hazard his own Person, as he had formerly done, in defence of the just Liberties and Properties of the Nation. But still the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of his song was, <hi>More mony.</hi> Which
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:62803:98"/>
the Parliament, willing to Engage him, if possible, by all the Testimonies of their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Loyalty, or at least to shew that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing should be wanting on their part, readily granted. And in regard that <hi>Argyle</hi> was said to be Landed, under the Notion of a Rebel in <hi>Scotland,</hi> they declared their Resolutions to stand by and assist him, with their Lives and Fortunes, against all his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies whatever. No less quick to gratify, than he to make those Promises which he never intended to perform. And indeed, under the Consternation the King was then in, upon the Landing of <hi>Argyle</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the D. of <hi>Monmouth</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> both at the same time, perhaps the Parliament might have bound him up to what Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they pleas'd; had they not slipt their Opportunity. But those two Storms being fortunately blown over, the one by ill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, the other by the Treachery of Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Friendship, and both <hi>Argyle</hi> and the D. of <hi>Monmouth</hi> safe in their Graves, the King was so puft up with a Petty Victory overy a few <hi>Clubmen,</hi> and so wrapt up with a Conceit, That he had now Conquer'd the whole Nation, that after he had got as much as he thought he could in modesty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, or they part withal, unless they saw greater Occasions than they did; which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:62803:99"/>
were no small Sums, in the heat of their obliging Generosity at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of a Reign, he turn'd him off, after he had sold them two or three inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Acts for all their Mony.</p>
            <p>And now being freed from any farther thoughts of Parliaments, believing himself Impregnable; he resolves to be Reveng'd upon the <hi>Western</hi> People for siding with his Capital Enemy <hi>Monmouth</hi>; and to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, sends down his Executioner in Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, <hi>Iefferies,</hi> not to decimate, according to the Heathen way of Mercy, but with the Besome of his Cruelties, to sweep the Country before him, and to depopulate, instead of Punishment. At what time, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, or Relation of any that fell in the Field, with a slender Circumstance tack'd to either, was a Crime sufficient for the Extirpation of the Family. And Young and Old were hang'd in Clusters, as if the C. Justice had design'd to raise the Price of Halters; besides the great Number of those that upon bare Suspicion were transported beyond Sea, and there sold for Slaves, and the Purchase-Mony given away to satisfy the Hunger of needy Papists. After-Ages will read with Astonishment, the barbarous Usage of those poor People, of which among many Instances, this one may seem suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:62803:99"/>
whereby to take the Dimensions of all the rest: That when the Sister of the two <hi>Hewlands</hi> hung upon the <hi>Chief Iustices</hi> Coach, Imploring Mercy on the behalf of her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; the Merciless Judg, to make her let go, caus'd his Coachman to cut her Hands and Fingers with the lash of his Whip: Nor would he allow the Respit of the Execution but for two days, tho the Sister with Tears in her Eyes, offer'd a Hundred Pound for so small a Favour. And whoever sheltr'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of those forlorn Creatures, were hurried to the Slaughter-House with the same inexo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable outrage, without any Consideration either of Age or Sex; Witness the Execution of the <hi>Lady Lisle</hi> at <hi>Winchester.</hi> As for <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyle</hi> and the Duke, tho they might die pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied, yet could they not be said to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly put to Death, in regard they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Open Hostility, and therefore it was no more than they were to expect, upon ill Success. However, since they were betray'd into the Victor's Hands, before any great harm was done, the Crime was not so great that nothing but a Massacre could atone for it; more especially considering what great Advantages the King made of these Rebellions. For it gave him a fair Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to increase the Number of his Standing-Forces, under pretence, That the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:62803:100"/>
Militia was not to be depended upon, and of the Reputation he had lost of being so Miserably unprovided against <hi>so wretched an Attempt as Monmouth</hi>'s was. For which Reason, he was resolv'd to be better provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded henceforward for the Security of the Nation; and to croud in his Popish Officers into Commands, under the Notion of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of approv'd Loyalty, and therefore such whose Persons he was neither to expose to disgrace by a Removal, nor himself to suffer the want of: Cautious and wary of Remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Popish Commanders, but minding not at all to remove the Fears and Jealousies of the Nation.</p>
            <p>However his Plausible Promises, and this Important Necessity of augmenting his Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Forces, were urg'd upon the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as undeniable Reasons for More Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. So great a Confidence the King had either in the Awe which he had upon the Parliament, or that they were so Blind that they could not see through his Cobweb Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences. But he soon found that he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in his Expectations, and therefore perceiving his Gilded Hooks could not take, they were decently Dismiss'd, after ten Days Sitting, with a Prorogation from <hi>October</hi> till the <hi>F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="193" facs="tcp:62803:100"/>But it seems King <hi>Iames</hi> was so confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently assur'd, That the Bands of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and Alliance between him and the <hi>French</hi> King were so Indissoluble, That whatever Assistance the Parliament deny'd him in <hi>England,</hi> he should not fail of from his Dear Friend and Confederate in <hi>France</hi>; That the Parliament being call'd for no other Intent or Purpose than to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray the Nation, by Furnishing the King to accomplish his Designs of Popery and Arbitrary Government; when they refused to be subservient to those Wicked Designs, and thought it more Honourable to be true to the Nation whom they Represented, than Serviceable to the Encroachment of his Tyranny, he lay'd them aside, as things no longer useful for him.</p>

This the King knew must be done by Judges that had abandoned all High Opinion of God and Nature, and had quitted all sense of Conscience and True Honour; and had wholly given up their Judgments to the foolish Enticements of Ambition and Flattery: And when he had found out such, it was easie for him to say, with his Grandfather of the same Name, <hi>Let me make what Iudges I please, and I will easily have what I please to be Law.</hi> No wonder then these Judges having Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

For he had no way to carry Illegality with a high hand, but by arrogant Domineering, and surly Incivility, while he had nothing to offer to any Person, that offer'd Law to him, but <hi>Sic Volo, Sic Iubeo.</hi> To tell a Peer of <hi>England</hi> and the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> so much his Superiour, only that he Sate upon the Throne of his Commission, he that was not to be mentioned with the Bishop in the same day, was such a foul piece of Exeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berance of his <hi>Guildhall</hi> Eloquence, which
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:62803:103"/>
only could have dropt from the lips of Insulting Barbarism. All that can be said for him is this, That as many men commit Absurdities when loden with Wine, this was one of his Extravagancies in his Drink of Honour. And indeed, after he had tasted of that potent Charm, the whole Course of his Behaviour seem'd to be a meer Intoxication, which made him after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards make use of the same Receipt to drown both his Life and his Dishonour toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>However, the Suspending this Noble Peer and Bishop, contrary to all pretence of Law, for refusing to obey the Kings unjust and illegal Command, was no such Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the King's Cause, that he had so much reason to thank the Chancellor, or <hi>Peters</hi> either, for putting him upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting a greater Act of Injustice, to justify a less. The Bishop was too well, and too gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally belov'd among all the professors of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testantism,</hi> for the Papists to put such an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front upon so Eminent a Father of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Church, for them not to resent it; even, the more prudent Papists thought it a Proceeding too harsh and unreasonable, and the more moderate look'd upon it as too base and unworthy; so that the Hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spurs of the King's Council were losers on
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:62803:103"/>
every side. And besides, it was such a stabbing contradiction to the King's Speech in Council upon his Brother's Death, <hi>That since it had pleased God he should succeed so good and gracious a Prince as his dear Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he was resolv'd to follow his Example, more especially in that of Clemency and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness to his People.</hi> That the barbarous suspending this Bishop was one of the main things which destroyed the solemn verity of Royal Word.

But the King was under a necessity; he had declar'd one thing to the Protestants, but he had bound himself to do another for the Papists. If he falsified with the Protestants, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists could absolve him; If he prov'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful to the Papists, they would never forgive him. And in this <hi>Dilemma</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd to follow the Maxim of his Profession, <hi>Not to keep Faith with Hereticks.</hi> Neither were the steps he made, the steps of State-conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, now and then upon an exigency; but all in a huddle, out of his Zeal, <hi>to make large steps, for fear he should dye and leave the Papists worse than he found them.</hi>

               <hi>where they will be able to tutor the young Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars in the Catholick Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor was it thought sufficient to turn the Proprietors out of their Freeholds, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of disobedience to the King's Commands, they were also made uncapable of any Ecclesiastical Preferment, or of the Exercise of Holy Orders, and depriv'd of all those other ways and means of Livelihood, for which their Education had qualified them. Which as it was a piece of Inhuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity without parallel, so it was a plain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration of the main drift and design of the King and his Popish Furies, first to draw the Protestant Clergy into the snare of Disobedience, and then under the pretence of Obstinacy and Stubborness, totally to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press and silence them.</p>
            <p>And yet after all this, for the King so publickly to give himself the Lye, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming to all the World, as he did, such a notorious untruth, as <hi>That he had never invaded the Property of any Man since his coming to the Crown,</hi> was such a piece of Dissimulation, that <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> himself, with all the Irreligion laid to his Charge, was never guilty of. Unless his Father Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor design'd it for a Miracle to be Recorded among Popish Wonders, That he who had done nothing else from the beginning of his
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:62803:105"/>
Reign, but invaded the Liberties and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rties of his Subjects, should be so confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent as to deny it. But whatever, through the frailty of his memory, he had till then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got, he was resolv'd, it seems, for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to make amends for his omission. To which purpose he was now provided with such a Gunpowder-Plot, that had it taken effect, would, ere a few Months had gone about, have blown up all the Properties of the whole Clergy of <hi>England,</hi> without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of any person that had either Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or Conscience; and the greatest part of the Bishopricks and Livings of <hi>England</hi> would have been pronounc'd void, to make way for Sandals and shaved Crowns.</p>
            <p>This was that cunning Declaration for Liberty of Conscience, whereby he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to dispense with the Laws by the sole vertue of his Prerogative. An attempt wherein his Brother had miscarried, being forc'd to surrender up, and Cancel the Illegal Contrivance he had prepar'd for a Tryal. But King <hi>Iames</hi> puffed up with the great Exploits he had in person per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd upon <hi>Honslow-Heath,</hi> and the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious shew his Army made there, Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouz'd at the same time in the same place, to add terror to his Commands, resolv'd
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:62803:105"/>
to make all Opposition bow the <hi>Knee</hi> to <hi>Baal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In pursuance of those Resolutions, he Orders his Declaration to be printed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the Bishops to cause it to be distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted through all their Diocesses, and to take care that it should be read in all the Churches and Chappels throughout the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Upon this the Bishops Petition the King, setting forth the Illegality, and the ill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences of it to the whole Nation both in Church and State; and beg the King not to insist upon the Reading it. This so incens'd <hi>Peters</hi> and the rest of the furious Hotspurs, and consequently provok'd the King to that degree, That the Court-Lawyers are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently consulted, who adjudge the Petition Tumultuary and Libellous; and thereupon the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> together with the Bishops of <hi>Asaph, Ely, Chichester, Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells, Peterborough,</hi> and <hi>Bristol,</hi> are first sent to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and then Arraign'd and Tried for Mutineers against the King's Popish Government, being Charg'd with an Information for Publishing a Seditious, Pernicious, and Scandalous Libel. But notwithstanding all that the King's Council, and the C. J. <hi>Wright,</hi> and <hi>Alibone</hi> the Papist could do, Judge <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lloway,</hi> and Judge
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:62803:106"/>
               <hi>Powel,</hi> to their Eternal praise, stuck so close to their Protestant Principles, and so strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppos'd the King's Dispensing Power, for which they were turn'd out the next day, that the Bishops were acquitted, to the general Joy and Satisfaction of the whole Nation; and particularly of the Soldiers upon <hi>Honslow-Heath,</hi> whose Shouts and Acclamations upon the News of their Acquittal, were so harsh and unpleasant in the King's ear, that from thence forward he began to wish he had more <hi>Irish,</hi> and fewer <hi>English</hi> in his Army.</p>
            <p>But notwithstanding this Fatal Blow, the most undaunted High Commissioners drove on furiously, sending forth their Mandates to the Chancellors, Archdeacons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the several Diocesses, to send them an exact account of all such Ministers as had refus'd to Read the Declaration. And there is no question to be made, but that the severity of that Imperious Court would in a short time have swept the Kingdom clear of all the Protestant Clergy, had not indulgent Heaven put a stop to their impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Career.</p>
            <p>That which follows, is so Romantick, that it looks more like a Novel, than a Story fit to gain Credit, hardly carrying so much Probability with it, as the Fable of
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:62803:106"/>
               <hi>Bacchus,</hi> cut out of <hi>Iupiter</hi>'s Thigh; and which looks more Romantick than all the rest; That the King himself should believe, and urge it for an Argument to delude the World, <hi>That he who had suffer'd so much for Conscience sake, could not be capable of so great a Villany to the prejudice of his Children</hi>; and inforcing the same Argument yet further, by saying, <hi>That it was his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, to do as he would be done by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would rather dye a thousand Deaths, than do the least Wrong to his Children.</hi> When the World was convinced, that he could not have suffered such an Affront to have been put upon him, but for the very Reason he alledged; and that, as for his <hi>doing as he would be done by,</hi> it was apparent by all his Actions, that he could not speak those Words from his Heart, without some Mental Expositions reserved to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
            <p>Certainly therefore, since it was for the Preservation of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that the Contrivance was set on foot, it argues, that his Conscience was under the most dreadful Subjection to his Popish Confessors, or that his Zeal was no less strangely govern'd by an imperious Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that for the sake of Popery, he should
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:62803:107"/>
consent to a Conspiracy against his own Flesh and Blood. He would not endure to be Excluded from the Succession, but he would Exclude his own Daughters from the Succession, and yet tell us, 'tis his Principle, <hi>To do as he would be done by</hi>; as if he thought the way to make us credit a Story of his Son, were to tell an untruth of himself.</p>
            <p>The World that grows Wiser every day than other, will never be made believe, that a Person debilitated by the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Effects of the exasperated Revenge of an injured Bed, and meeting with a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort no less infirm, by whom he never had before any Child, but what dropt into the Grave, as soon as Born, not having any substantial Rafters for Life to build upon, should so seasonably nick it, to be both the Parents of a sound Off-spring for the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Popery.</p>
            <p>She, who ought to have taken all advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages to have had publick and undeniable Testimonies of her Glory, to be the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a Prince, so providentially sent from Heaven, to Support and Establish the <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Faith, in a Revolted King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, would never have been so reserv'd, and shy of exposing the Symptomes of her preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:62803:107"/>
but only to a few that were privy to the Imposture.</p>
            <p>Add to this, the Flight of the Midwife, in whom it never could be a Crime to bring a Queen to Bed. But omitting the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Circumstances, sufficiently already canvassed, to detect the <hi>Pious Fraud</hi>; and the Chyrum of Affidavits to cover the Cheat, all brought upon the publick Stage, by dire constraint on the one side, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modest Bigottry on the other; the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py occasion of revealing the Arcana of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration to every Turnspit, and serving only to inflame the desires of wanton Youth; Omitting, I say, these Circumstances, there are others, no less remarkable of another Nature; as the sending <hi>Castlemain</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> among other things, to impart this Affair to his Holiness, and to know whether the Apostolick See would stand by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Prince, in case the People should dispute his Title. And this seems to be confirmed by the coming over of Count <hi>Dada,</hi> in the Quality of the <hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>Nuntio,</hi> just as the Farce was contriving, and the Popes being afterwards Godfather to the Child.</p>
            <p>In the next place, about the time that the Conception was pretended, Father <hi>Peters</hi>
               <pb n="208" facs="tcp:62803:108"/>
was taken into the Privy Council; to give the Report all the Favour imaginable at the Board, to prevent the being of it Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested, or if it were, to satisfie all manner of Doubts, and so incite the Lords to make such Orders, as the Case required; which had no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> been so proper for the King, or the rest of the Popish Lords, who knew not so well what to insist upon. Another thing was, that the Child was no sooner Born, but it was translated to <hi>Richmond,</hi> lest the pretended Mother should have been put to the Trouble of a forced Fondness, which had the Child continued with her, would have prov'd a part so irksome, and so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll for her to act, that notice would have been taken of it.</p>
            <p>Nor was it less observable, that at the same time the Bishops were lock'd up safe, that they might be out of the way of being called for Witnesses, whose Impartiality otherwise would have been desiring more satisfaction to their Consciences, than the depth of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery requir'd.</p>
            <p>To which may be added, That at first, the King himself, who had most Reason to know, did not seem to give Credit to the thing, or at least, was very doubtful of it; and therefore, when the News was
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:62803:108"/>
first brought him, as one that rather wish'd it true, than thought it to be real; he made answer to the Messenger, <hi>If it were so, 'twas very odd</hi>; till finding that the Lady of <hi>Loretto</hi> would take Bribes, and had espoused the blessed Design, he was bound to believe, that his Mother-in-Law's Prayers, and the Diamond Bodkin had prevail'd; and that his Royal Consort had been impregnated by an Apparition, like the Mother of <hi>Damaratus,</hi> King of <hi>Sparta.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, it was look'd upon all over <hi>Europe,</hi> as a very low and mean Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scention of a Soveraign Prince, Hedge-Sparrow like, to hatch the Cuckoo's Egg, and own the supposititious Issue of another Man; which they, who pretend to make the best Excuse for, seem willing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve proceeded more from Fear than Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science; in regard, that being privy to the many Conspiracies of the Priests and Jesuits against his Brother's Life, it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed him with such a dread of their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Mercy, that he yielded to whatever they desir'd, for his own Preservation. On the other side, the Priests and Jesuits were so terribly afraid of a Revolution after his Death; that by the Power of his imperious
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:62803:109"/>
Queen, and their own Importunities, they hurried him on to all those Impolitick Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitances, that hastened both their own and his Ruin.</p>
            <p>For now the Nation, no longer able to brook such a deluge of illegal Oppressions, and the whole Body of the Nobility and Gentry of the Kingdom, observing such a general Desolation impending upon their Religion, Lives, and Fortunes, apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to their Hignesses the Princess and Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> as the only Cherubims on Earth, under whose Wings they could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire for Safety and Protection. Who no soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, with a Generosity becoming a true Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Protestant Faith, appear'd in their Defence, but Consternation seized King <hi>Iames</hi> and all his Raving Counsellors.</p>
            <p>Upon the first News of the Heroic Prince's Preparations, he takes off the Bishop of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>'s Suspension, restores the City-Charter, with all those other Franchises which had been so tempestuously ravish'd from other Corporations, and returns the Ejected Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of both Universities to the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds which he had wrested out of their hands. But yet to shew how firm he was in his Resolutions to resume the same Despo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Power again, had his Success once an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:62803:109"/>
his Expectations; after he had order'd the Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi> to put in the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows of <hi>Maudlin</hi> College, he no sooner heard of the Prince's being put back by storm, with some small Loss, which was heightned out of Policy in <hi>Holland,</hi> but he recall'd his Orders to the Bishop, sent for him to <hi>London,</hi> and stopt the Re-admission of the Fellows, till he heard the Prince was again Embark'd and prosperously bending his Course for <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So soon as he heard the Prince was Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he summons his Affidavit Lords and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies about him, in hopes to have sworn his pretended Son into the Succession, in case of any Miscarriage of his own Person, which he never intended to indanger. After that he flew to <hi>Salisbury,</hi> believing the Terror of his Name would have gain'd him present Victory. But not meeting the good Fortune he expected, all he did there, was to discourage his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers with his Pusillanimous Fears and Frights upon every little Allarm of a Post-Boy. So that altho he had good Counsel given him, To Horse all his Foot, and fall upon the Enemy while they were yet labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the inconveniencies of the Sea, and before their Numbers increased, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unless he might keep his Teagues about him, and expose the <hi>English</hi> to the usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:62803:110"/>
dangers of Road beaters. Which together with their unwillingness to engage the Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verers of their Country, so alienated their hearts from him, that they deserted him by Troops and Regiments. Desponding at this and more terrified with a little bleeding at the Nose, than he had been with all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Blood which he had caus'd to be spilt, he returns back to <hi>London,</hi> and having sent his Queen and her Babe before, which was sufficient Warning for <hi>Dada, Peters,</hi> and the rest to provide for themselves, he withdrew from the City; but being taken, rifled, and seiz'd by the Country People near <hi>Fever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sham</hi> before they knew him, he was brought back to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> where having his Choice given him to stay in <hi>England,</hi> or go beyond Sea, he rather chose by a voluntary depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to abdicate the Realm. To which he was advis'd by his Council, that assur'd him, The Distractions of the Kingdom would make way for his Return in a little time; <hi>Which God forbid</hi>!</p>
            <p>And thus, to the surprize of all men, came to pass a Revolution so Sudden, so Great, and Unexpected, that History cannot paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel. It seem'd a Labyrinth of Providence, to which the Belov'd of Heaven WILLIAM
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:62803:110"/>
HENRY only had the Clue; while Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Fortitude were the <hi>Ariadnes</hi> that gave him their Assistance to subdue the <hi>Mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taur</hi> that devoured our Religion and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Two conspicuous Examples at once of Heaven's Indignation, and the Almighty's Favour; the one pursuing to his downfal an Apostate from God, and an Oppressor of his People, and exposing him among unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Bog-trotters upon the lingring death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed of his gasping Glory, the fetter'd Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal of his once fawning Confederate. The other prospering with Miracles of Success, the Generous Redeemer of the True Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion, from the devouring Jaws of that double-headed Monster, <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Slavery</hi>; By whose Auspicious Conduct two late languishing Kingdoms, groaning under the heavy weight of Misery and Tyranny, enjoy a Jubilee of Peace and Tranquility, and freed from the daily fears of Massacre and Destruction, in the fair way to recover their Pristin Glory, have now no more to do, but to repay their Praises to Heaven, and their due Acknowledgments to Them that have approv'd themselves the truly Indulging Father and Mother of their Country: A Prince, the Wonder of His Age; a Princess, the Miracle of Her Sex; in whom all Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,

as in their proper Center meet; ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the Nation happy in <hi>Two</hi> in <hi>One,</hi> as the whole World is blest in <hi>Three</hi> in <hi>One</hi>; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom, next under Heaven, depend the hopes of all that cordially desire the Welfare and Prosperity of <hi>Christendom.</hi>
