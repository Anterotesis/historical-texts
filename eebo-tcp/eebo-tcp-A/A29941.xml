         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>TOuching the name of <hi>London,</hi> from what occaſion the City ſhould be ſo denominated, divers Authors conceit di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly.</p>
               <p>Some are of opinion, that <hi>London</hi> took the name of <hi>Ludſtone</hi>; for King <hi>Lud</hi> not onely repaired this City, but alſo increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame with fair buildings, Towers, and Walls, and after his own name, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it <hi>Cair Lud, i. e.</hi> the Town of <hi>Lud,</hi> and the ſtrong Gate, which he erected, in the weſt part of the City, he likewiſe for their own honour and reputation na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it <hi>Ludgate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Others ſay, it is ſo called from the word <hi>Llhwn</hi>; for ſeeing <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and <hi>Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo</hi> do write, that the ancient Britains cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thoſe woods, and Groves by the names of Cities, and Towns which they had fenced with Trees, caſt down and plaſhed, to ſtop up the paſſage; and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſuch VVoods or Groves are in the Brittiſh tongue named <hi>Llhwn,</hi> they are in inclined to the opinion, that <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>

thence took name, as one would ſay, by way of excellency, the City, or a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thick of Trees.</p>
               <p>Again, Others are of opinion (which ſeemeth to be the moſt probable) that whence <hi>London</hi> had the ſame, there alſo it took the name, even from Ships which the Brittains in their dialect call <hi>Longh</hi>; ſo that <hi>Londinum</hi> may ſeem to ſound as much as a Ship Road, or City of Ships: for the Brittains term a City <hi>Dinas,</hi> whence the the Latines have fetch'd their <hi>Dinum.</hi> And hence it is, that elſewhere it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Longidinum,</hi> and in the Funeral Song of a moſt ancient Brittiſh Poet, <hi>Llong Porth,</hi> that is an Harbour or Haven of Ships: And by this very term <hi>Bononia,</hi> or <hi>Bolea</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> which <hi>Ptolomy</hi> calleth <hi>Geſſori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acum Novale,</hi> in the Brittiſh Gloſſary is named <hi>Bolung-Long.</hi> For many Cities have drawn their names from Ships, as <hi>Naupactus, Nauſtathmas, Nauplia, Nava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia Auguſti,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p>IN relation to Aldermen three things are worthy of notice, <hi>ſc.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Etymology of the words (Alderman, and Senator.)</p>
                  <p>An Alderman is among the Romans, <hi>Laticlavius, Senator,</hi> and <hi>Optimas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>An Alderman from the <hi>Saxon</hi> word Ealderman, <hi>i. e. Senex, quod Senes ſolum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo illum dignitatis gradum accipiant</hi>: Hence among the Latins, he is called Senator.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gothofredus</hi> tells us, that <hi>Senatores dicti non ſunt ab aſſentiendo,</hi> as <hi>Hugoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> and <hi>Bartolus</hi> ſuppoſe, but <hi>à ſenili aetate,</hi> or <hi>à virtute,</hi> for heretofore, <hi>Senes apud Romanos Viri optimi appellati ſunt.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="39" facs="tcp:101099:23"/>
                     <hi>Olim apud Britones</hi> (ſayes one) <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poribus Romanorum in regno iſto Britanniae vocabantur Senatores qui poſtea temporibus Saxonum vocabantur Aldermanas, non propter aetatem, ſed propter ſapientiam, &amp; dignitatem, cùm quidam adoleſcentes eſſent, Juriſperiti tamen &amp; ſuper hoc experti.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Their election; The Aldermen of <hi>London</hi> were changed by election every year, until 28. E. 3. Then it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that they ſhould not be removed, without ſome ſpecial cauſe.<note place="margin">

                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:101099:28"/>2. In all caſes, where the King is party, the Sheriff may break the houſe (if the doors be ſhut) and make execution of his writ, but before he break the houſe, he ought to ſignify the cauſe of his coming, and make requeſt to have the Doors opened: but if the Officer break the houſe, when he might have the Doors opened, he is a Treſpaſſer; for felony, or ſuſpition of felony the officer may break open the door.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Sheriff cannot break open an houſe upon private proceſs; neither can he upon private proceſs ruſh into a houſe, which by craft, as knocking at the door &amp;c. he procured to be opened unto him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In all Caſes where the door is open, the Sheriff may enter, and make execution of his writ, either for body, or goods, at the ſuit of a ſubject.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Sheriff at the ſuit of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon perſon (upon requeſt made, and denial thereof) ought not to break open the doors, or the houſe, to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute any proceſs at the ſuit of any ſubject; or to execute a <hi>Fierifac.</hi> Being a writ of execution, but he is a Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſer, yet if he do execution in the

The houſe of a man is not a Caſtle, or defence for any other perſon, but for the owner, his family and goods, and not to protect another, that flyeth into the ſame, or the goods of another, for then the Sheriff upon Requeſt, and denial, may break the houſe, and do execution.</p>
