            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>MOrtals behold here prostrate to your sight,</l>

            <l>Which did not take his sence from him away,</l>

            <l>Death ends his life, so he in's grave was laid.</l>
            <l>Oh then remember this you that have health.</l>
            <l>Death playes the theese, takes many a one by stealth,</l>
            <l>Before of him they think, this I may say</l>
            <l>He hardly will allow them time to pray.</l>
            <l>Then we that live had need to pray apace,</l>
            <l>That sees death and the grave before our face.</l>
            <l>Let's humbly pray, and <hi>Ninive</hi> cloath-like,</l>

            <head>Of the man that revived again in S. <hi>Georges</hi> Church-yard.</head>
            <l>A Countrey man, as 'twas to me reported,</l>
            <l>About some businesse to this town resorted,</l>
            <l>Finding himself not well, strait way he went</l>
            <l>Into S. <hi>Georges</hi> fields in discontent,</l>
            <l>He drunk a penny-worth of milk 'tis said,</l>
            <l>And down upon the ground himself he laid;</l>
            <l>The milk-woman of whom the milk he bought,</l>
            <l>Told him to lie upon the ground 'twas naught,</l>
            <l>And wisht him then to rise, but he replide,</l>
            <l>That he would there but little time reside</l>
            <l>Vpon the ground, onely to rest his head,</l>
            <l>And sleep a little on that earthy bed;</l>
            <l>She seeing him so resolutely bent,</l>
            <l>Took up her milk pail, and away she went.</l>
            <l>And for a certain truth to me twas told,</l>
            <l>That after she in town her milk had sold,</l>
            <l>She came the same way home, and found him dead</l>
            <l>As she poor woman then imagined,</l>
            <l>But twas not so, for in a trance lay he,</l>
            <l>Yet others were deceiv'd as well as she;</l>
            <l>For all that saw him did conclude and say,</l>
            <l>The man is dead, let us make haste away,</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:17601:5"/>And to the Sexton of the Parish go,</l>
            <l>Telling him how it is, then let him do</l>
            <l>As he sees fit, then unto him they told,</l>
            <l>And did the matter unto him unfold.</l>
            <l>And to the Masters of the Parish then,</l>
            <l>The Sexton went with other honest men,</l>
            <l>And told them how the matter then did stand,</l>
            <l>The Masters of the Parish gave command</l>
            <l>To bring the man that was supposed dead,</l>
            <l>Into the Church-yard, which they quickly did,</l>
            <l>And then the searchers they were fetcht with speed,</l>
            <l>So all concluded he was dead indeed;</l>
            <l>And when the corps the Searchers had survaid,</l>
            <l>They saw no cause why they should be afraid;</l>
            <l>For of the Plague they found the man was free</l>
            <l>As cleare a corps as ever they did see:</l>
            <l>So then to bury him they all conclude,</l>
            <l>But mark I pray what afterward ensude.</l>
            <l>It being neare night, the Sexton did agree</l>
            <l>To bury him when he could better see.</l>
            <l>The first worke in the morning that he did,</l>
            <l>Should be to bury him: meane while he hid</l>
            <l>The man under a Coffin, as some say,</l>
            <l>Not that he fear'd that he would runne away,</l>
            <l>But that no ravenous thing should him offend,</l>
            <l>So that in this he was the dead mans friend.</l>

            <l>He found upon his arme some blew spots there,</l>
            <l>Which like unto Gods tokens did appeare.</l>
            <l>So spurs his horse, and speedily he rides</l>
            <l>To the next town, and there all night abides.</l>
            <l>But yet before he went to bed 'tis said,</l>
            <l>In's chamber he a good fire causde be made:</l>
            <l>So when the Chamberlain had made a fire,</l>
            <l>A payle of water he did then desire.</l>
            <l>Then cal'd he for the best sheet in the Inne,</l>

            <l>The sheet being wet, and he starke naked in it,</l>
            <l>About his body he did strait way pinne it;</l>
            <l>Which being done, away to bed he went.</l>
