            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </hi> Charls <hi>made a little pauſe, to ſee what anſwer that</hi> Henry <hi>would return to him; But when he perceived him to be ſtil ſilent he thus did proſecute his Diſcourſe; <hi>My Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead ſtrange Rumours were ſpread of it; not long afterwards I marryed with the Daughter of France, and in the beginning of my Raign made two unfortunate Wars, the one with the Spaniard, the other with the French, a Parliament being called at</hi>
                  </hi> Oxford <hi>I loſt the love of my people, for diſſolving it at that inſtant when the Duke of</hi> Buckingham <hi>was queſtioned for having a hand in my Fathers Death; At this I perceived that the people did repine, but I was too conſtant alwayes to my own Counſailes, and although many Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments were afterwards called, I diſſolved them all. This infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced me to put unuſuall taxes upon my people; by which and by the enertainment of the Queen Mother of</hi> France <hi>(a Lady moſt extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hated by the Generallity of the Nation) I wonderfully increaſed their evil opinion of me; At the laſt we did proceed to Armes (the Parliament then bearing ſway, by me not ſuddainly to be diſſolved) and the War not thriving with me, I was brought to</hi> London, <hi>a Court was called, not before heard of, and I proteſting againſt the unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſs of it, and that there was no Power on Earth by which I was to be tryed, they paſſed the ſentence of Death on me, according unto which I ſuffered.</hi>

It was greivous to you to be in cuſtody at S. <hi>James,</hi> becauſe in your tender years, you did there delight your ſelf with innocent paſtimes. Do you not cal to mind how heretofore I ſeized upon that place by violence? As indeed what place was free from my cruelties and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, you are not ignorant how moſt unjuſtly I brought unto my Exchequer, to ſatisfy my own avarice, all the Eſtates of the <hi>Carthuſian, Bernardine,</hi> and <hi>Ciſtercian Monks,</hi> and of all the other Orders, but eſpecially of the Order of Saint <hi>Benedict,</hi> whoſe Lands and revenues were the greateſt, and whoſe Covents, and houſes were the faireſt? How many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent men have I impriſoned, becauſe they would not be ſubject to my will? It was I that cauſed ſome <hi>Abbots</hi> to be hanged before their own doors, to become a terrour to the other <hi>Monks.</hi> Do you not know that even your own Palace, was heretofore the Houſe of the Archbiſhops of <hi>York,</hi> which I extorted from <hi>Cardinall Wolſey,</hi> whom I advanced to great honours and riches, whiles I found him a profitable Miniſter to my luſt, and afterwards cruſhed him to peices when I found it to be expedient for my avarice; It was I who although I never ſtarted from the obedience of the Church
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115398:4"/>of <hi>Rome,</hi> but onely in one particular to ſatisfy my luſt; did afterwards compell all the Biſhops of the Land, to ſubſcribe to what I commanded, the Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter</hi> onely except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whom becauſe I could not overcome, neither by threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, nor perſwaſions, I made him ſhorter by the head.</p>

               <p>Yes, unto your ſelf, and to all that had relation to you; Beſides, Flatter not your ſelf, He who receiveth money of a Judge for the ſeat of Judicature, perverteth Juſtice. You need not to fear that any private deſignes or Combinations ſhould diſpoſſeſſe you of your life, for ſo the puniſhment would not anſwer the offence, it is expedient and neceſſary that publick ſins ſhould be publickly expiated. I afterwards that I began to offend, did not act fearfully, nor did ſeek out Corners, for the commiting of Iniquity, but made pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of Juſtice for my Impiety. I divorced my ſelf from my lawfull wife, and pretended Law for it. On the ſame account I brought the goods of divers men into my Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, whoſoever oppoſed me, I impeached them of Treaſon, and cauſed them to ſuffer accordingly for it, therefore when I did acts of unrighteouſneſs, and pretended Law, I ought not to wonder if I my ſelf ſhould ſuffer puniſhment in the ſame nature.</p>

               <p>Ah!

They uſed their utmoſt Indeavours to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote my Intereſts. The Catholicks hoped that I would moder ate that ſeverity of the Laws which were made against them by you and</hi> Q Elizabeth, <hi>and King</hi> James <hi>my Father, laying a great penalty on all thoſe who would not acknowledge them to be the ſupreame Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, in the Territories of their Dominions. The Biſhops and Prelats were eager to maintaine my cauſe, that ſo they might preſerve their own Dignities, and Fortunes, that is their Biſhopricks, and Benefices, which ſeemed otherwiſe to be in a moſt ruinous Condition.

If any refuſed to ſubſcribe unto them I cauſed them to be hanged up, eſpecially
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:115398:5"/>the chiefeſt of them, to be a terrour to the reſt. Thus when I was pleaſed to exerciſe my will, I cauſed divers for fear of Death, to ſubſcribe to what I did propound unto them, and that ſo handſomly, as if it had been their own motion.</p>

                  <hi>But I did deal more gently, nevertheleſs being reſolved at the laſt to have recourſe to Armes, I did betake my ſelf to the Northern part of my Kingdome, and having erected the Royall Standard, not far from</hi> Notingham, <hi>the moſt faithfull of my Subjects, did from every part of the Kingdome reſort unto me, whoſe number in a ſhort time was ſo great that they hold out a War for above the ſpace of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven years againſt the Parliament; It is remarkeable to ſee with what reſolution, above all the reſt, the Roman Catholicks did adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture their lives, and their fortunes for me, and that not onely in one field, but whereſoever their War made triall of their valour; but the Army of the Parliamen prevailed, and I being driven to the greateſt extremities did betake my ſelf unto the</hi> Scots, <hi>as to my laſt refuge, amongſt whom I did not long continue but I was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to ſome of Note in the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Army, who carrying me from one place to another, have at laſt brought me hither in this ſad Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wherein you ſee me.</hi>

               <p>The Engliſh were alwayes much addicted to their Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in which they found a conſtant redreſs for all their greivances, it is therefore leſs to be admired that they revolted from you; but how came it to paſs that thoſe of your own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the <hi>Scots</hi> ſhould make war againſt you?</p>

                  <hi>The Revolt of the</hi> Scots <hi>was the cheifeſt cauſe of my Ruine, for if I had to deal onely with the</hi> Engliſh, <hi>I could have kept them in obedience, or have reduced them to it by the aſſiſtance of my faithfull Subjects, both im</hi> England, <hi>and in</hi> Ireland; <hi>But the</hi> Scots <hi>fell off from me upon this account; It was my deſire that throughout all my Dominions, there might not be onely the ſame form of faith, but of Rights, and Ceremonies, and that the Liturgy of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>together with the Surplice might
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:115398:6"/>be uſed by the Miniſters of</hi> Scotland. <hi>This I muſt confeſs I did by the perſwaſion of the Arch-biſhop of</hi> Canterbury, <hi>whom I did reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence as a Patriarch, which when the people of</hi> Scotland <hi>understood, and perceived that it began to be put in practiſe, they preſently cried out that Papiſtry, and the abomination of Rome began be intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, hereupon ſeditions began to increaſe which were much fomented by the Pulpits.

               <p>Ah <hi>Charls</hi> you are much deceived, if you think me free from puniſhment, puniſhment doth alwayes follow ſin, neither was there ever any one that hath got cleerly off, and not payed for his Impiety. Not to ſpeak of the torments which I do now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure; What pangs did I not feel within me whiles I was alive being perpetually ſcourged with rods of knotted ſteel by the three Beadles of <hi>Avarice, Cruelty, and Incontinency.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the firſt place, my <hi>Avarice</hi> was ſo unſatisfied that after I had overthrown three hundred and ſeventy fix Monaſteries, and with one Edict taken away all their Goods and Lands, one year was not fully expired, before I oppreſſed my Subjects, with greater taxes then before. Being palate-taken by this firſt Morſell, not long afterwards, I brought into my treaſury all the other Monaſteries of the Kingdome, it is not eaſy to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend how many &amp; how rich they were. Whiles I made havock of theſe, I did feed my Subjects with vain hopes that the goods thus gotten would ſo cram my treaſury, that they ſhould never have need to fear any more Subſidies, which news was ſo wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to the people that they were greatly pleaſed, and much applauded what I did; But they were ſo deluded of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, that after this I exacted more upon them then all
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:115398:6"/>my Predeceſſors had done in five hundred years before. After that I had Plundred and levelled to the ground, about one thouſand Churches, and converted to my uſe the goods appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate to them, after that by force I had ſeized upon their gold, their ſilver, and conſecrated veſſailes, and ſold the braſs, the lead, the ſtones and timber belonging to them; and out of the Church of <hi>Canterbury</hi> alone, had taken two great Cheſts ſo full of gold, and precious ſtones, that four men could hardly ſtir either of them, I was driven to ſo extreame a penury, that whereas at firſt by my Proclamation, two ounces of braſs were to be mixed with ten ounces of ſilver, I afterwards gave order that two ounces of ſilver, ſhould be mighled with ten ounces of braſs; After this manner was I tormented by my Covetouſneſs, neither did I ſuffer leſs by my cruelty.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for the firſt 20 years before I exerciſed any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent &amp; arbitrary power, no King before me did ſhed leſs blood; In all that time there were but two Noble men that loſt their lives, but after that I began to ſhow my ſelf in my own colours, I was as greedy of blood as I was before of gold, and made a great laughter of all ages, ſexes, and orders whatſoever, and for no other treſpaſs but that they oppoſed my pleaſure. Four Queens that ſucceſſively had bin married to me, did loſe their lives, either by the Axe, or by a grief as fatall as the Axe. I proſcribed two Princeſſes, two Cardinalls, and the third who was not onely my Kinſman, but at that time out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. I did put to Death by the common Hangman 12 eminent perſonages who were either Dukes, or Marqueſſes, or Earls, or the Sons of Earls, two and twenty Barons, and Knights, ſixteen Abbots and Priors, ſeventy ſeven Prieſts and Religious men, and others of a lower rank almoſt not to be numbred. And in this ſo black a cruelty I was feared by none more then by the moſt faithful of my won friends, as the Events of <hi>Wolſey Norris,</hi> of the Family of the <hi>Bullens,</hi> and of the <hi>Howards,</hi> have declared.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Moreover I did ſo proſtrate my ſelf unto Luſt, that after the divorſe of my beſt and my firſt wife, I ſaw no Lady handſommer then other, with whom I not preſently fell in love, neither made I love to any whom I would not enjoy.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:115398:7"/>Was it not for the puniſhment of my ſins, that you and your Father were crowned Kings of <hi>England,</hi> when I left no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unattempted, that I might hinder you from the poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Kingdom of England, and by ſome heir of my own might confirm it in my own houſe. Two wives I did drive out of my bed, and two out of the World, the fifth I cauſed to be ripped up alive, being then in labour and full of her childing throwes, that her child might be preſerved, adding to the cruelty theſe barbarous, and inhumane words, <hi>that Wives could more eaſily be found then Children.</hi> I married the ſixth wife, and intertained thoughts of taking her our of the World, when not long afterwards I was taken out of the World my ſelf. But in this great care of mine, and iudea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour for poſterity, not any of my race lived threeſcore years after my Death; It is true that a child of mine, of nine years of age, did ſucceed me in the Government, but not well able to govern himſelf, much leſs the Kingdome, and who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted out of the World, before he departed out of his nonage, My Daughter <hi>Mary,</hi> did afterwards receive the Crown, but rejected the Religion of her Brother, I might well expect to have had iſſue by her, being five years Married to <hi>Philip,</hi> the Catholick King of <hi>Spain,</hi> but God the Revenger of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Murders, and abhominations committed, would not that my Race <hi>ſhould inherite the Land;</hi> for he is not to be mocked, neither doth his word fall upon the ground, which ſaith, <hi>For the ſins of the Fathers the daies of the Children, ſhall be ſhortned.</hi> She therefore in a ſhort time dying without iſſue, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is tranſlated unto you. It is true that my Daughter <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ſucceeded my Daughter <hi>Mary,</hi> but being never Married ſhe alſo without iſſue deſcended into the ſleep of Death.</p>
               <p>Thus do I find true what the Kingly Prophet did foretell me. <hi>The ſeed of the wicked ſhall periſh, Pſalm.</hi> 37. and in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place. <hi>Thou ſhalt deſtroy their fruit from the Earth, and their ſeed from the ſons of men, Pſalm.</hi> 12. By wofull experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, I do ſay, I have proved the truth of his prophecy, for it pleaſed God to laugh at the vain counſails of men, And
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:115398:7"/>the ſame Prophet giveth this reaſon of it, <hi>For they imagined Counſailes which they could not bring to paſs.</hi> Pſalm. 21. <hi>For their is no Counſaile againſt the Lord. Pro.</hi> 21. As now too late I have learned. Will you have me yet further to confirme the truth of this unto you. When I was dying I did leave unto my Son <hi>EDWARD</hi> twelve Tutors, all of them Catholicks, as I conceived, and commanded them to bring him up in the Catholick Religion, the Supremacy of the Church onely excepted, which I would have him to continue, and to reſerve unto himſelf, but I who violated the teſtaments of others, and overthrew ſo many Monuments of Piety, did not deſerve that my own ſhould be kept; Of ſo many Tutors the Duke of <hi>Somerſet</hi> Unkle to <hi>Edward,</hi> by his mothers ſide, after my Death was Tutor alone unto him, and brought him up in that Religion, which I forbad him, and hated. I command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alſo that a more ſumptuous Monument ſhould be provided for me, then was ever raiſed for any of my Predeceſſors, and as yet I have no Monument at all, although of all the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> not one of them had three children that ſucceſſively ſwayed the Scepter but my ſelf. But, alas, I need not fear that I ſhall be ever loſt in the memory of men, I have purchaſed to my ſelf an everlaſting Name, by my enormous offences. All ſorts of men do ſtrive as it were in emulation who ſhall hate me moſt. I am become juſtly odious to the Catholicks becauſe I divided <hi>England</hi> from the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> I am abhomination to the orders of the Religious, becauſe I have extinguiſhed their Charters and themſelves, and have ſold their Lands, and houſes. I am deteſtable both to the Clergy, and the Laity, becauſe I have raiſed a perſecution, againſt even the whole Name of Catholicks, which continueth to this day. The Proteſtants hate me, becauſe through all the courſe of my life, I did purſue them with fire and Sword; <hi>Luther</hi> named me a big-bellied Beaſt, and a Tyrant; <hi>Calvin</hi> hath written bitterly againſt me, and brandeth me in his books, as deſtitute of all fear of God, and the ſhame of men. All Lettered men will evermore curſe my memory, beauſe I have utterly deſtroyed ſuch excellent Monuments of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:115398:8"/>and Antiquity that the Chriſtian World can hardly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralell. Finally whiles I was alive, moſt men hated me, all men feared me, no man loved me. In my laſt dayes, like <hi>Oreſtes,</hi> I was tormented with the Conſciouſneſs of my ſins, and deſired to reconcile my ſelf to the Church, and to make ſome amends for the injury offered to my wife, the latter I did in ſome part performe, for I provided in my will, that my Daughter <hi>Mary</hi> born of Queen <hi>Katharine,</hi> whom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I had diſinherited, ſhould ſucceed in the Kingdome, if my Son <hi>Edward</hi> ſhould dye without children. Oh how often have I diſcourſed with my friends of the firſt, but as I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived many of them, heretofore by the ſame artifice, ſo now I my ſelf became ſuſpected to them all, and they grew to be jealous of me, and to ſhun me, as diving into their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets. And thus being abandomed by all, I dyed without the Communion of the Church, repeating oftentimes in my laſt houre theſe words, <hi>We have loſt all.</hi> Being dead, I had the ſame end as <hi>Ahab,</hi> and it is the more remarkable becauſe it was in the Ruines of a Religious houſe, for as my Corps naſty with exceſſive fatneſs, and too great a Belly, was on the way tobe convaied hither, the Coffin of Lead in which it was put did crack by chance, and opened; To ſoder which, a Plummer being ſent for, my Corps was ſet down in the ſaid ruines of the houſe, there, whiles the Plummer was running from place to place, being very buſie at his work, his dog moſt greadily did lick the blood that iſſued from me. A Revenge from God for the effuſion of ſo much blood, which in my life time I had ſoilled. <hi>Charls,</hi> Do you not now ſee ſufficiently how God hath ſcourged me in my own perſon; Never think that I have eſeaped unpuniſhed!</p>

Which is not ſo to be undeſtood, that children altogether guiltleſs and innocent ſhould be overwhelmed in the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their moſt ungodly fathers, <hi>For the Soul that ſinneth ſhall dye,</hi> but that Children not ſo guilty, and as it were inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent in compariſon of their fathers, are oftentimes involved in their puniſhments; for if this puniſhment had come to paſs in the dayes of ſome luxurious and wicked King, I ſhould have looked to further for the cauſes of it, but on the Crimes of ſo diſſulute a Grovernour; But that your Subjects who do call themſelves Proteſtants, ſhould affict upon you ſo igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious a Death as by making you ſhorter by the head, when your Enemies can accuſe you of no groſs offence, muſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be imputed to nothing elſe, but to the Capitall ſin of my miſgovernance, in which though not ſo viſibly, others and your ſelf, no doubt have partaken with me.</p>

               <p>O how juſt are the Judgments of God, and his wayes paſt finding out? For in whatſoever a man finneth, he either ſooner or later ſhall be puniſhed by it, either in himſelf, or in his poſterity. <hi>I would to God when I was alive and in my proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or that in the time of my Impriſonment when I had leaſure enough, that</hi> I <hi>had ſeriouſly thought on theſe things.</hi> O that in the bitterneſs of my ſoul I had obſerved <hi>the proceedings of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Juſtice, ow ſlowly it came on, and how long it did hang over

An incomparable Scholler, and highly eſteemed in the days of my Father and Q'een</hi> Elizabeth, <hi>hath left recorded that God doth moſt for Kings, and Kings, againe do leaſt for God. But be wiſe O you Princes, and learn righteous Judgment, O you Judges of the Earth; O that the flattery of being obove all Laws had never ſounded in my eares; O that I had never been accuſed of Arbitrary Government; O that I had known that my higheſt Prerogative had b<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>en the love and the obedience of my Subjects! I had leiſure enough to write and to compoſe a whole Book on other Anguments, as on the overthrowes of my Armyes, on my own miſeries and calamities, and on the inſolencies of other men; But theſe things which I ought to lay moſt neer unto my heart, and on which above all things I ought moſt to meditate, did never enter into my thought. I would to God that the Biſhop of</hi> London, <hi>honeſt</hi> Juxon, <hi>for ſo I was accuſtomed to call him, or he who intirely loved me, and was to me a faithfull Counſailer in all other things, and who laid down his life for my ſake,</hi> William Laud, <hi>the Arch-Biſhop of</hi> Canterbury, <hi>had advertiſed me of theſe things either by Letters from himſelf, or by words of mouth from his friends; he had before his Death, the tedious leiſure of three years Impriſonment, to meditate and to ruminate on them.</hi> But they were hid from their eyes. <hi>O how blind were my ſeers!

                  <hi>It is likely that my Armies were the more unfortunate, becauſe I was ſo indulgent to it. The ſuper ſtition of the Papiſts, and the most petulant probhaneneſs of the other part of my Army, have rendred me a greater Subject of Calamity and Contempt then I believe I ſhould have otherwiſe appeared to the World. I have bled enough al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. Think not to give new wounds unto me by ſtriking at me in my Religion. What the ſacred Authority of the Word of God, and the light of my own Conſcience hath convinced me unto: What nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the frequent ſolicitations of forraign Princes, nor the hourly Importunity of my deareſt Wife, could diſſwade me from; What (dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) I commanded my children to imbraces, I ſhall never after Death be induced to retract. In this reſolution I do expect the day of a joufull Reſurection, the Morning ayre whereof I do already feel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing me. The unrighteous ſhall then tremble at the ſound, and the ſummens of a Trumpet from Heaven; they ſhall wiſh that the Rocks and the Hills might cover them, that ſobeing hid from the preſence of the Lamb, they might lye for ever confin'd to the dull peace of a Grave.</hi>
