            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>L studies haue theyr speciall tymes (Ryght noble Lady) all good partes, and singuler quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the mynde are holden vp, and maynteyned with honour.

So that the studies of good letters haue their times in respecte of mans age, they haue theyr tymes in the order of learning: yea they haue a tyme, that maketh vs all to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe therein our tyme, and to studie eche facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in due tyme, I meane that speciall tyme they floryshe in. I may not denye but that learnyng hath at all tymes ben well accompted of, in most countreys the skyll of dyuers languages well thought of, &amp; learned men to haue ben alwayes rewarded. what is than that speciall tyme wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all studies doe flooryshe?

of the earth, and the speciall tyme of learnyng, vnto theyr singuler seasons. In May, floures: in Iune, Cheries: at Haruest, corne: in September, Grapes: so fareth it in the study of good letters. There was a tyme wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the arte of grammer was so muche esteemed, that Gramariens proceeded masters thereof as woorshypfully, as other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessours now doe in any other facultie. Than was it honourable to be a Poet: honourable I say, for that the Poet Laureate enioyed the honour of a Palatine. that tyme is paste. There was a tyme whan Logike &amp; Astrology onely so weeried the heades of young schollers, yea and busied olde age also, that true Philosophie in deede was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most forgotten, eloquence defaced, the langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges exiled. that tyme is past. Not long since hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py was he that had any skil in the greke tongue, he was thought a great scholler that could make a greeke verse. Nowe a dayes, who studieth not rather the Hebrue language? VVhere haue you almost any greeke aucthour printed? Geography laye hydden many hundred yeeres in darkenesse and obliuion, without regarde and price: of late who taketh not vppon him to discourse of the whole worlde, and eche prouince thereof parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culerly, euen by hearesay, although in the first principles of that arte, he bee altogeather igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and vnskylfull? This tyme is now. So long as Poetry was esteemed, the arte of grammer accompted of, Logike muche made of, Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy well thought of: Diuine Poets, good Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mariens, perfecte Logiciens, excellent Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomers no where wanted.</p>

            <p>It is nowe almost one hundred &amp; fiftie yeeres agoe, that Don Henrico, sonne of Iohn the fyrst of that name Kyng in Portugale, and Nepheu vnto our Kyng Henry the fourth, made his vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age after the conquest of Sep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

His grande Nepheu Iohn the seconde, so furthered this enterpryse, that the Portugale shyppes halled the Cape of good hope, discouered Aethiopia, and sayled where antiquitie denyed passage, beyond all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica into the Indian seas. He sent also expert and
<pb facs="tcp:22913:4"/>
cunning traueylers into Aegypt, and the redde sea coastes to espye what way the Portugales might looke for beyond the Cape of good hope to Calecut in India: the which viage in his sonne Emanuell his tyme, was prosperously taken in hand by Vasquez Gama, the nienth day of Iuly, in the yeere of our Lorde .1497. &amp; happely ended in Iuly againe, two yeeres after, to his great cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and preferment, to the immortal fame &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his Prince and countrey. Here began the studie of Geographie, that euer since Ptolomeus raigne laye troden vnder foote, &amp; buried in dust and ashes, to spring vp agayne, and by the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of skilful traueylers in Europe, Affrike, &amp; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie: through the discouery of the far Indies, the Moluccaes, &amp; new founde landes, of late so to be wondred at, as no other facultie more. I dare be bold to say, that generally all Christians, Iewes, Turkes, Moores, Infidels, &amp; Barbares be this day in loue with Geographie. The wylde and rogishe Tartares myght for famine perishe in the winter, if they in the sommer skylfully followed not the sunne. The heathen Giapans diuided the worlde into three partes: Afrike was described by a Moore. The Iewes report the estates of all coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyes to the Turkes. The Turkishe Basshaes go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne the sweetest prouinces in Europe, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frike, and Asia, no men greater traueylers than Christians. VVho but Geographers doe teach vs what partes of the earth be cold, warme, or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate?

Let Gama be set in place, and Gama will tell you the situation, the maners, the force and wealth of forreyne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for Gama his endeuor was, not onely by his friend Coelius to descrye the countrey wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer he came, but also to learne him selfe the riches, strength, and conditions of the people. Honour maynteyneth arte: and the skill in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ography, as all other sciences, hath but a tyme of preferment, the whiche than chiefly myght bee looked for, whan it is most esteemed. This in the noble mynde of Cadamust bred that earnest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, after Don Henrico his example, to traueyle, to pen his owne aduentures into the Southeast and East partes, to make the nauigation of Gama and his companions knowen vnto the worlde. The occasions, the good successe, the great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities wherof, Barros a counseller of the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugale Kyng, paynted out long agoe in manye bookes, Osorius of late, historically hath written the same in fewe.

            <p>Christian charitie therefore vnto the party de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, caused me to helpe his workes forwarde: Nature moued me to take some paynes in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing orderly, that whiche he had confusely gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen out, the better to direct, and the more to profit the reader: My profession enforced me to cut of some superfluous translations, and to fill vp the rest of his doinges with P.

Hoping and perswading with my selfe, that if God likewise call me from these worldly Nauigations, and earthly descriptions, before my other trauell in this facultye, taken long since in hande, be ended: some other profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor of Cosmography wil so rewarde me after my death, as presently of this dead man I doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue.

And not only they that dyed, dyd not inioye the Indies whiche they fyrst disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered to theyr mysfortune, but the resydue also that lyued had in maner as litle fruition of the same: not leauyng, or at the least not openly publyshyng any memorie thereof, neyther of the place, or what it was called, or in what yeere it was founde: Albeit, the fault was not theyrs, but rather the malyce of other, or the enuie of that which we call fortune. I do not therfore marueyle, that the auncient histories affyrme, that great thynges proceede and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of small and obscure begynnynges, syth we haue seene the same veryfied in this fynding of the Indies, being so notable and newe a thyng.

               <p>CHristopher <hi>Colon</hi> was borne in <hi>Cugureo,</hi> or (as some say) in <hi>Nerui,</hi> a vyllage in the territorie of <hi>Genua</hi> in Italie. He descended as some thynke, of the house of the <hi>Pelestreles</hi> of <hi>Placentia</hi> in <hi>Lumbardie.</hi> He beganne of a chylde to be a maryner: of whose arte they haue great exercise on the ryuer of <hi>Genua.</hi> He traded many yeeres into <hi>Suria,</hi> and other partes of the East. After this, he became a maister in makyng cardes for the sea, whereby he had great vantage. He came to Portugale to know the reason &amp; description of the south coastes of Affrica, and the nauigations of the Portugales, thereby to make his cardes more perfecte to be solde. He maryed in Portugale, as some say: or as many say, in the Ilande of <hi>Madera,</hi> where he dwelt at suche tyme as the sayd Carauell arryued there, whose Pilot soiorned in his house, and dyed also there, bequeathyng to <hi>Colon</hi> his carde of the description of suche newe landes as he had found, whereby <hi>Colon</hi> had the fyrst knowledge of the Indies. Some haue thought y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Colon</hi> was wel learned in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Latine tongue and the science of Cosmographie: and that he was thereby fyrst moued to seeke the lands of <hi>Antipodes,</hi> and the rych Ilande of <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pango,</hi> wherof <hi>Marchus Paulus</hi> wryteth. Also that he had redde what <hi>Plato</hi> in his dialoges of <hi>Timeus</hi> and <hi>Cricias,</hi> writeth of the great Ilande of <hi>Atlantide,</hi> and of a great land in the west Ocean vndiscouered, beyng bygger then Asia and Affrica. Furthermore that he had knowledge what <hi>Aristotell</hi> and <hi>Theophrastus</hi> saye in theyr bookes of maruayles, where they wryte that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne merchauntes of Carthage, saylyng from the streyghtes of <hi>Gibraltar</hi> towarde the West and South, founde after many dayes a great Ilande not inhabited, yet replenyshed with al thynges requisite, and hauing many nauigable ryuers.

and conferred chiefely with a fryer, named <hi>Iohn Perez</hi> of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chena,</hi> that dwelt in the monastery of <hi>Rabida.</hi> So that I veryly beleeue, that in maner all that he declared, and many thynges more that he leaft vnspoken, were written by the sayde Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyshe Pilot that dyed in his house. For I am persuaded, that if <hi>Colon</hi> by science atteined to the knowledg of the Indies, he would long before haue communicat this secreate to his owne countrey men the <hi>Genueses,</hi> that trauayle all the worlde for gaynes, and not haue come into Spayne for this purpose. But doubtelesse he neuer thought of any such thyng, before he chaunced to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the sayde Pilot, who founde those landes by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, accordyng to the saying of Plinie, <hi>Quod ars docere non po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuit, casus inuenit.</hi> That is, That arte coulde not teache, chaunce founde. Albeit, the more Christian opinion is, to thynke that God of his singuler prouidence and infinite goodnesse, at the length with eyes of compassion as it were lookyng downe from heauen vppon the sonnes of Adam, so long kept vnder Sathans captiuitie, intended euen then (for causes to hym onely knowen) to rayse those wyndes of mercy whereby that Carauell (herein most lyke vnto the shyppe of Noe, whereby the remnante of the whole world was saued, as by this Carauel this newe worlde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued the fyrst hope of theyr saluation) was dryuen to these landes.

And seyng the kyng of Portugale occupied in the conquest of Africa, and the Nauigations of the East, whiche were then fyrst attempted, the kyng of Castyle lykewyse no lesse busyed in the warres of <hi>Granada,</hi> he sent to his brother <hi>Bartholomewe Colon</hi> (who was also priuie to this secrete) to practise with the kyng of England (Henry the seuenth) beyng very ryche and without warres,<note place="margin">Kyng Henry the seuenth.</note> promysyng to bryng hym great ryches in short tyme, if he woulde shewe hym fauour, and furnyshe hym with shyps to discouer the newe Indies, whereof he had certayne knowledge.

in the mouth, and as it were in the entrie (where you place the Columnes of Hercules) an Ilande whiche was sayd to be much greater then al <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>Asia,</hi> and that from thence was pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage to many other Ilandes neare thereabout, and from the sayde Ilandes to the continent or fyrme lande, whiche was right ouer agaynst it neare vnto the sea: Yet, that within the mouth, there was a litle gulfe with a porte: the deepe sea without, was the true sea, and the lande without was the true continent. This Ilande was named <hi>Athlantides,</hi> and in it was a kyng of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueylous great power and myght, who had the dominion of the sayde Ilande, and many other, and also a great part of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent lande whereof we haue spoken, and muche more towarde our partes also, forasmuche as they were dominatours of the thyrde part of the worlde conteynyng <hi>Africa, Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi> euen vnto the sea <hi>Tirrhenum.</hi> The power therefore of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng then so great, they came to inuade both your countrey and ours, and all other that are within the Columnes of Hercules. Then (<hi>O Solon</hi>) the vertue of your citie shewed it selfe famous in magnanimitie and feates of armes, with the assemblance of the other Grecians, in resystyng theyr great power, vntyl you had driuen them out of our lands, and restored vs to our libertie. But shortly after that this enterprise was atchiued, befel a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueylous great earthquake, and exundation or ouerflowing of the sea, which continued for the space of one day and nyght: In the whiche the earth opened it selfe, and inglutted all those vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant and warlike men, and the sayde Ilande <hi>Athlantides</hi> sunke into the bottome of the sea, whiche was the occasion that neuer from that tyme forwarde, any shyp coulde sayle that way, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the great mudde and slyme whiche remayned of the drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Ilande.</p>
               <p>This is the summe of those thynges whiche olde <hi>Critia</hi> sayde he had vnderstoode of <hi>Solon.</hi> And certaynely these wordes of <hi>Plato</hi> of the said Iland, haue caused great contention among ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great Philosophers, which haue written commentaries vpon the sayde Dialogue of <hi>Timeus</hi> composed by <hi>Plato:</hi> Insomuche that the same in those dayes being vtterly vnknowen, many haue taken this narration of <hi>Solon,</hi> for an allegorical fable, and haue interpreted the same in diuers senses and meanynges. But it
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:22913:16"/>
may nowe well appeare the true meanyng hereof to be this: that <hi>Plato</hi> intendyng to wryte of the vniuersall frame of the worlde, the whiche he knewe to be made an habitation for the diuine best man, and also beholdyng therin the great ornament and beautie of the heauen and starres, whereby man myght knowe his God and creatour, it myght seeme to hym a thyng to farre from rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that only two partes thereof shoulde be inhabited, and the other part desolate and depriued of men: and that the Sunne and starres might seeme to shewe theyr lyght only halfe theyr course without profite, shining only vpon the sea and desolate pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, destitute of man and other liuing creatures. And therefore <hi>Plato</hi> had in great admiration the hystorie of the sayde Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an priest, makyng mention of an other part of the worlde besyde <hi>Asia, Europa,</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> and thought it woorthy to be rehearsed in the beginning of his diuine Dialogue aforesayde. We ought therefore certainely to thinke our selues most bounde vnto God, that in these our tymes it hath pleased hym to reueale and disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer this secrete in the fyndyng of this newe worlde, whereby we are certaynely assured, that vnder our Pole starre, and vnder the <hi>Equinoctial</hi> line, are most goodlye and ample regions, as well and commodiously inhabited, as are other partes of the worlde best knowen vnto vs.</p>

The same prouidence (I knowe not by what destenie) hath brought me out of my natiue coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of Milane, and out of the citie of Rome (where I continued almost .x. yeeres) into Spaine, that I myght particularlye col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecte these marueilous and newe thinges, which shoulde other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse perhappes haue lien drowned in the whirlepoole of obliui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, forasmuche as the Spanyardes (men worthy great commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation) had only care to the generall inuentions of these thinges. Notwithstanding, I do not chalenge vnto me only, the thankes of the trauaile bestowed herein, whereas the chiefe rewarde ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is due to Ascanius,<note place="margin">Cardinal As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canius.</note> vicount Cardinal, who perceauyng that I was wylling to departe out of the citie to be present at the warres of <hi>Granatum,</hi>

of thynges. I was therefore presente at the warres, from whence I writte to Cardinal Ascanius, and by sundry epistles certifyed hym of such thinges as I thought most woorthye to be put in memorie. But when I perceiued that his fortune was turned from a naturall mother to a stepdame, I ceassed from wrytyng. Yet after I sawe, that by thouerthrowe of the enimies of our fayth, Spayne was pourged of the Moores, as of an euil weede plucked vp by the rootes, leste I shoulde bestowe my slippery yeares in vnprofitable idlenesse, I was mynded to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to Italie. But the singuler benignitie of both the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyke kyng and queene nowe departed, and theyr large promises towarde me vpon my returne from my legacie of Babylon, deteyned me from my purpose. Yet doth it not repent me that I drew backe my foote, aswel for that I see in no other place of the world at this tyme the lyke woorthy thinges to be done: as also that in maner throughout all Italie,<note place="margin">Italy disquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with warres.</note> by reason of the discorde of Christian Princes, I perceiued all thynges to runne headlong into ruine, the countreys to be destroyed and made fatte with humane blood, the cities sacked,<note place="margin">The sequeles of warre.</note> virgins and matrones with theyr goods and possessions caried away as captiues, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable innocentes without offence to be slayne vnarmed within theyr owne houses. Of the whiche calamities, I dyd not onely heare the lamentable outcryes, but dyd also feele the same: For euen the blood of myne owne kinsfolkes and frendes, was not free from that crueltie. As I was therefore musyng with my selfe of these thynges, the Cardinal of Arragone, after that he had seene the two fyrst bookes of my Decades wrytten to Asca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, required me in the name of kyng Frederike his vncle,<note place="margin">Kyng Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rike.</note> to put foorth the other eyght epistle bookes. In the meane tyme also, whyle I was voyde of al care as touching the matters of the Ocean, the Apostolicall messengers of the byshop of Rome, Leo the tenth (by whose holsome counsayle and aucthoritie we trust the calamities of Italy shalbe fynished) raysed me as it were from sleepe, &amp; encoraged me to proceede as I had begun. To his holynesse I wrytte two Decades, comprysed in short bookes, after the maner of epistles, and added them to the fyrst, which was printed without mine aduise, as shal further appeare by the preface folowyng. But nowe I returne to you (most

Thus after a fewe dayes, with cheareful harts they espied the lande long looked for.

On the South syde of <hi>Cuba,</hi> he founde an Ilande whiche the inhabitauntes call <hi>Iamaica,</hi> this he affirmeth to be longer &amp; broder then the Iland of <hi>Scicile,</hi> hauyng in it only one mountaine, which on euery part,<note place="margin">The iland of Iamaica.</note> beginning from the sea, ryseth by litle and litle into the myddest of the Ilande, and that so playnely without roughnesse, that such as goe vp to the toppe of the same, can scarcely perceiue that they assende: This Ilande he affyrmeth to be very fruiteful and ful of people, aswel in thinner partes of the same, as by the shore,<note place="margin">Quicke wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted people.</note> and that the inhabitantes are of quicker wytte then in the other Ilandes, and more expert Artificers, and warlyke men: For

in many places where he woulde haue aryued, they came ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med against him, and forbode him with threatnyng wordes: but beyng ouercome, they made a league of frendshyp with hym. Thus departing from <hi>Iamaica,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the earth.</note> he sayled toward the West, with a prosperous wynde, for the space of threescore and tenne dayes, thynking that he had passed so farre by the compasse of the earth being vnderneath vs,<note place="margin">Aurea Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonesus, or Malaccha.</note> that he had ben neare vnto <hi>Aurea Chersone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi> (nowe called <hi>Malaccha</hi>) in our east India, beyonde the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynnyng of <hi>Persides</hi>: for he playnely beleeued that he had left on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly two of the twelue houres of the sunne,<note place="margin">A secreate of Astronomie.</note> which were vnknowen to vs, for the olde wryters haue left halfe the course of the sunne vntouched, where as they haue but only discussed that superficial parte of the earth whiche lyeth betweene the Ilandes of <hi>Gades,</hi> and the ryuer of <hi>Ganges,</hi>

But not regardyng al these perylles, he determined to proceede, vntil he had certaine knowledge whether <hi>Cuba</hi> were an ilande, or firme lande. Thus he sayled forward, coastyng euer by the shore toward the West for the space of .CC.xxii. leagues, that is, about a thousande and three hundred myles, and gaue names to seuen hundred ilandes by the way, leauyng also on the left hande (as he feared not to report) three thousande here and there. But let vs nowe returne to suche thynges as he founde woorthy to be noted in this nauigation. Saylyng therefore by the syde of <hi>Cuba,</hi> and searchyng the nature of the places, he espy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not farre from <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>O</hi> a large hauen,<note place="margin">A large hauen.</note> of capacitie to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borowe many shyppes, whose entraunce is bendyng, beyng in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed on both sydes with capes or poyntes whiche receiue the water: this hauen is large within, and of exceedyng deapth.

pounde weight, and two serpentes of eyght foote long apeece: whereat marueylyng, and lookyng about if they could espye any of the inhabitauntes, and that none appeared in syght (for they fledde al to the mountaynes at the commyng of our men) they fel to theyr meate, and ate the fyshe taken with other mens tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle, but they absteyned from the serpentes, which they affirme to differ nothing from the Crocodiles of Egypt,<note place="margin">Crocodiles of Egipte.</note> but only in byg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: for (as <hi>Plinie</hi> sayth) Crocodiles haue sometymes ben found of .xviii. cubits long, but of these the biggest were but of eyght foote. Thus being wel refreshed, they entred into the next wood, where they found many of the same kynde of serpentes, hanging vpon boughes of trees, of the whiche, some had theyr mouthes tyed with strynges, and some theyr teeth taken out. And as they searched the places neare vnto the hauen, they sawe about .lxx. men in the top of a hygh rocke, whiche fled as soone as they had espyed our men, who by signes and tokens of peace callyng them agayne, there was one which came neare them, and stoode on the toppe of a rocke, seemyng as though he were yet feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: but the Admiral sent one <hi>Didacus</hi> to hym, a man of the same countrey, whom he had at his fyrste voyage taken in the ilande of <hi>Guanahaini,</hi> being neare vnto <hi>Cuba,</hi> wyllyng hym to come neare, and not to be afraide. When he hearde <hi>Didacus</hi> speake to hym in his owne tongue, he came boldly to hym, and shortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter resorted to his company, perswading them to come without al feare. After this message was done, there dessended from the rockes to the shyps, about threescore and ten of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantes, profering frendship and gentlenesse to our men: whiche the Admiral accepted thankfully, and gaue them diuers rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, and that the rather, for that he had intelligence by <hi>Didacus</hi> the interpreter, that they were the kynges fyshers,<note place="margin">The kinges fishers.</note> sent of theyr lorde to take fyshe agaynst a solemne feast whiche he prepared for another kyng.

Thus ioynyng handes for a token of further frendshyp, euerye man resorted to his owne. The Admirall went forwarde as he had appoynted, folowyng the fallyng of the sunne from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>Cuba,</hi> called <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>O:</hi> the shores or sea bankes euen vnto this hauen, albeit they be full of trees, yet are they rough with mountaines:<note place="margin">Blossomes &amp; fruites both at one time.</note> of these trees, some were full of blos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somes and flowres, and other laden with fruites. Beyonde the hauen, the lande is more fertile and populus, whose inhabitantes are more gentle, and more desyrous of our thynges: for as soone as they had espied our shyppes, they flocked all to the shore, bryngyng with them suche bread as they are accustomed to eate, and gourdes ful of water, offeryng them vnto our men, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, desyryng them to come alande. In al these Ilandes is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine kinde of trees as bigge as Elmes,<note place="margin">Trees which beare gourds.</note> whiche beare Gourdes in the steade of fruites, these they vse only for drynkyng pottes, and to fetche water in, but not for meate, for the inner substance of them is sowrer then gall, and the barke as harde as any shell. At the Ides of May, the watchmen lookyng out of the top castle of the shyp, towarde the South, sawe a multitude of Ilandes standyng thycke togeather,<note place="margin">A multitude of Ilandes.</note> being al wel replenished with trees, grasse, and hearbes, and well inhabited: in the shore of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, he chaunced into a nauigable riuer, whose water was so hot,<note place="margin">Hotte water.</note> that no man might endure to abyde his hande therein anye time. The day folowing, espying a farre of a <hi>Canoa</hi> of fyshermen of the inhabitantes, fearyng lest they shoulde flee at the syght of our men, he commaunded certayne to assayle them priuily with the ship boates: but they fearing nothing, taryed the commyng of our men. Nowe shall you heare a newe kynde of fyshyng. Lyke as we with Greyhoundes do hunt Hares in the playne feeldes,<note place="margin">A straunge kinde of fis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing.</note> so doo they, as it were with a hunting fishe, take other fishes: this fyshe was of shape or fourme vnknowen vnto vs, but the bodye thereof not muche vnlyke a great yeele, hauyng on the hynder parte of the head a very tough skynne, lyke vnto a great bagge or purse: this fyshe is tyed by the syde of the boate with a corde, let downe so farre into the water, that the fishe
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:22913:32"/>
may lye close hid by the keele or bottome of the same, for she may in no case abyde the syght of the ayre. Thus when they espye any great fyshe, or Tortoyse (wherof there is great abundance,<note place="margin">Abundance of Tortoyses.</note> byg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then great targettes) they let the corde at length, but when she feeleth her selfe loosed, she inuadeth the fyshe or Tortoyse as swiftly as an arrowe, and where she hath once fastened her holde, she casteth the purse of skynne, whereof we spake before, and by drawyng the same togeather, so graspeleth her pray, that no mans strength is suffycient to vnloose the same, excepte by lytle and lytle drawyng the lyne, she be lyfted somwhat aboue the brymme of the water, for then, as sone as she seeth the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the ayre, she letteth goe her holde. The praye therfore beyng nowe drawen nere to the brymme of the water, there leapeth sodenly out of the boate into the sea,<note place="margin">Fisher men.</note> so manye fyshers as may suffice to holde fast the praye, vntyll the rest of the company haue taken it into the boate. Whiche thyng doone, they loose so muche of the corde, that the huntyng fyshe may agayne returne to her place within the water, where by an other corde, they let downe to her a peece of the pray, as we vse to rewarde greyhoundes after they haue kylled theyr game. This fyshe, they cal <hi>Guaicanum,</hi> but our men cal it <hi>Reuersum.</hi> They gaue our men foure Tortoyses taken by this meanes,<note place="margin">The fishe Guaicanum.</note> and those of suche byggenesse, that they almost fylled theyr fyshyng boate: for these fyshes are esteemed among them for delycate meate. Our men recompensed them agayne with other rewardes, and so let them depart. Beyng asked of the compasse of that lande, they aunsweared that it had no ende westwarde. Most instantly they desyred the Admirall to come a lande,<note place="margin">Humane people.</note> or in his name to sende one with them to salute theyr <hi>Cazicus,</hi> (that is) their kyng, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmyng that he woulde geue our men many presentes, yf they would goe to hym. But the Admirall, lest he shoulde be hindered of the voyage whiche he had begunne, refused to goe with them. Then they desyred to knowe his name, and tolde our men lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the name of theyr king. Thus sayling on yet further euer towarde the West, within fewe dayes he came nere vnto a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne excedyng high mountayne,<note place="margin">A mountayne fruitfull and well inhabited</note> wel inhabyted by reason of the great fertilitie of the same.

The kyng of this people, and dyuers other sage men that stoode by him, infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med hym that that lande was no Ilande. Shortly after, entring into one of the ilandes being on the lefte hande of this lande, they founde no body therin, for they fledde al at the comming of our men: Yet founde they there foure dogges of maruelous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed shape,<note place="margin">Dogges of strange shape and dumme</note> &amp; suche as coulde not barke.

These apparelled men, made sygnes and tokens to hym to tary, and not to be afrayd, but that notwithstandyng he ceassed not to flee. The Admirall beyng aduertysed hereof, and not a lytle reioycyng that he had founde a ciuile people, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continently sent foorth armed men, with commaundement that yf neede should so requyre, they shoulde enter fourtie myles
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:22913:33"/>
into the ilande, vntyl they myght fynde eyther those apparelled men, or other inhabitauntes of that countrey. When they had passed ouer the wood, they came into a great playne ful of grasse and hearbes, in whiche appeared no token of any pathway. Here attemptyng to goe through the grasse and hearbes, they were so entangled and bewrapt therein, that they were scarselye able to passe a myle, the grasse beyng there lytle lower then our ripe corne: beyng therefore weeryed, they were enforced to returne agayne, finding no pathway. The day folowyng he sent foorth xxv. armed men another way, commaundyng them to make dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent search and inquisition what manner of people inhabited the lande: Who departyng, when they had found, not farre from the sea side, certayne steps of wyld beastes, of the which they suspec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted some to be of Lions feete, beyng strycken with feare, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned backe agayne. As they came, they founde a wood in the whiche were many natiue vines, here and there creepyng about hygh trees,<note place="margin">Natiue vines. Trees bearyng spices &amp; sweete fruites.</note> with many other trees bearyng aromatical fruites and spyces. Of these vines they brought with them into Spaine many clusters of grapes, very ponderous, and ful of licour: but of the other fruites they brought none, because they putrified by the way in the shyp, &amp; were cast into the sea. They say also that in the landes or medowes of those wooddes, they sawe flockes of great Cranes, twyse as bygge as ours. As he went forward, and turned his sayles towarde certayne other mountaynes, he espied two cotages on the shore, in the whiche he sawe only one man, who being brought to the shippe, signified with head, fyngers, and by al other signes that he coulde deuise, that the lande whiche lay beyonde those mountaynes was very full of people: and as the Admiral drew neare the shore of the same, there met him cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne <hi>Canoas,</hi> hauyng in them many people of the countrey, who made signes and tokens of peace and frendshyp.

He had also intelligence, that in the inlande of this region was a king of great power, &amp; accustomed to weare apparell: he sayde that all the tracte of this shore was drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with water, and ful of mudde, besette with manye trees,

after the maner of our maryshes: Yet whereas in this place they went alande for freshe water,<note place="margin">Pearles in shel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fyshes.</note> they founde many of the shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyshes in the whiche pearles are geathered. But that coulde not cause the Admirall to tracte the tyme there, entending at this viage, only to proue howe many landes &amp; seas he could discouer according to the kinges commaundement. As they yet proceded forwarde, they sawe here and there, al the way along by the shore, a great smoke rysing, vntyll they came to an other mountayne foure score myles distant, there was no rocke or hyll that coulde be seene, but the same was all of a smoke. But whether these fyres were made by thinhabitantes for their necessary busynes, or (as we are wont to sette beacons on fyre when we suspecte thapproche of our enimies) thereby to geue warning to theyr neyghbours to be in a redines, &amp; geather togeather, if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps our men shoulde attempt any thyng against them, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse as (seemeth most lykely) to cal them togeather, as to a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to beholde our shyppes, they knowe yet no certentie. In this tracte, the shores bended somtyme towarde the South, and sometyme towarde the West and west southwest, and the sea was euerye where entangled with Ilandes,<note place="margin">The sea entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landes.</note> by reason whereof, the keeles of the shyppes often times rased the sandes for shalow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the water: So that the shyppes being very sore bruised and appayred, the sayles, cables, and other tackelinges, in maner rotten, and the vytailes (especially the biskette bread) corrupted by takyng water at the ryftes euyll closed, the Admirall was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to turne backe agayne: This laste poynte where he touched of <hi>Cuba</hi> (not yet being knowen to be an ilande) he called <hi>Euangelista.</hi> Thus turning his sayles towarde other ilandes ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not farre from the supposed continent, he chaunced into a mayne sea, where was suche a multitude of great Tortoyses, that somtyme they stayed the shyppes:<note place="margin">

At the length, fearing the shelfes of the ilands, he returned to the shore of <hi>Cuba</hi> by the same way whiche he came. Here a multitude of thinhabitantes, as well women as men, resorted to hym with cheerefull countenances, and with feare, bringyng with them popingayes, bread, water, and cunnyes, but especially stocke doues, much bygger then ours, which he affirmeth, in sauour and

taste, to be muche more pleasaunt then our partryches. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore where as in eating of them he perceiued a certayne sauoure of spyce to proceede from them, he commaunded the croppe to be opened of suche as were newely kylled, and founde the same full of sweete spyces, whiche he argued to be the cause of theyr strange taste: For it standeth with good reason, that the fleshe of beastes, shoulde drawe the nature and qualitie of theyr ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed nouryshment. As the Admirall harde masse on the shore, there came towarde hym a certayne gouernoure, a man of foure score yeeres of age, and of great grauitie,<note place="margin">The humanitie of a reuerende olde gouernour</note> although he were naked sauing his pryuie partes. He had a great trayne of men wayting on hym. All the whyle the prieste was at masse, he shewed him selfe very humble, and gaue reuerent attendance, with graue and demure countenaunce. When the masse was ended, he presented to the Admirall a baskette of the fruites of his countrey, delyuering the same with his owne handes. When the Admirall had gentelly entertayned him, desyring leaue to speake, he made an oration in the presence of <hi>Didacus</hi> the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter, to this effect. I haue byn aduertised (most mighty prince) that you haue of late with great power subdued many lands and Regions, hytherto vnknowen to you,<note place="margin">An oration of the naked go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour.</note> and haue brought no litle feare vppon all the people and inhabitauntes of the same: the whiche your good fortune, you shal beare with lesse insolencie, if you remember that the soules of men haue two iourneyes after they are departed from this body: The one, foule and darke,<note place="margin">Theyr opinion of the soule of man.</note> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for suche as are iniurious and cruell to mankynde: the other, pleasaunt and delectable, ordeyned for them which in theyr lyfe tyme loued peace and quietnes. If therfore you acknowledge your selfe to be mortall, and consider that euery man shal receiue condigne rewarde or punyshement for suche thynges as he hath done in this life, you wyl wrongfully hurte no man. When he had saide these wordes and other lyke, which were declared to the Admirall by the interpreter, he marueyling at the iudgement of the naked olde man, answeared, that he was gladde to heare his opinion as touching the sundry iourneys and rewardes of soules departed from theyr bodyes, supposing that nother he, or any other of thinhabitantes of those Regions, had had any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof: declaring further, that the chiefe cause of his

Within a fewe dayes after, both that the iourneys myght be the shorter, and also that our men myght haue more safe places of refuge, if the inhabitauntes shoulde hereafter rebell in lyke manner, he buylded another fortresse (whiche he called the Towre of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception) betweene the Citie of <hi>Isabella,</hi>

further within the land, the people of the countrey here and there resortyng to hym, gaue hym a certayne portion of theyr bread, in exchaunge for other of our thynges: but he coulde not long tary here, because they lacked meate in the fortresse, whyther he hasted with such as he had now gotten.

and fruites, hong so ouer theyr heades, that they might plucke them with theyr handes: also that the fruitfulnes of this ground, is eyther equall with the soyle of Isabella, or better.

After he had buylded this fortresse, leauyng therin a garryson of .xx. men, he with the remanent of his souldiers, prepared them selues to searche the inner partes of the West syde of the Ilande, hytherto knowen onely by name. Therefore about .xxx. leagues, (that is) fourescore and tenne myles from the fortresse, he chaunced on the ryuer <hi>Naiba,</hi>

When he had ouerpassed this ryuer with a companye of armed men diuyded into .xxv. decurions, that is, tenne in a company, with theyr ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitaynes, he sent two decurions to the regions of those kynges in whose landes were the great woodds of brasile trees.

Eche of the decurions filled certayne of the ilande houses with the trunkes of brasile, there to be reserued vntil the shippes came which should cary them away. But the Lieutenaunt directing his iourney towarde the right hande, not farre from the bankes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> riuer of <hi>Naiba,</hi> founde a certaine kyng whose name was <hi>Beuchius Anacauchoa,</hi> encamped against thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitantes of the prouince of <hi>Naiba,</hi> to subdue them vnder his do<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>minion, as he had done many other kings of the iland, borderers vnto him.

All the prynces which dwell betwene the West ende &amp; his palace, are ditionaries vnto him. All that region from <hi>Naiba,</hi> to the furthest marches of the west, is vtterly without golde, although it be full of mountaynes. When the kyng had espied our men, laying a part his weapons,<note place="margin">Mountaynes without golde.</note> &amp; geuyng signes of peace, he spake gentelly to them (vncerteyne whether it were of humanitie or feare) and demaunded of them what they woulde haue. The Lieuetenaunt aunsweared, That he should
<pb facs="tcp:22913:41"/>
paye tribute to the Admirall his brother, in the name of the Christian kyng of Spayne. To whom he sayde, Howe can you requyre that of me, whereas neuer a region vnder my dominion bringeth forth golde? For he had heard, that there was a strange nation entred into the ilande, whiche made great search for golde: But he supposed that they desyred some other thyng. The lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunt answeared agayne, God forbydde that we shoulde en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyne any man to paye such tribute as he myght not easely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare, or such as were not engendered or growing in the region: but we vnderstande that your regions bryng foorth great plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Gossampine cotton, and hempe, with such other, wherof we desyre you to geue vs parte. When he heard these woordes, he promysed with cherefull countenaunce, to geue hym as much of these thynges as he woulde requyre. Thus dismissing his army, and sending messengers before, he him selfe accompanied the Lieutenaunt, and brought him to his palace, being distant (as we haue sayde) .xxx. leagues. In al this tracte, they passed through the iurisdiction of other princes, beyng vnder his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: Of the whiche, some gaue them hempe, of no lesse good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to make tackelinges for shyppes then our wood: Other some brought bread, and some gossamppne cotton. And so euery of them payde trybute with suche commodities as theyr countreys brought foorth. At the length they came to the kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges mansion place of <hi>Xaragua.</hi> Before they entered into the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, a great multitude of the kynges seruauntes &amp; subiectes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorted to the court, honorably (after their maner) to receyue their kyng <hi>Beuchius Anacauchoa,</hi> with the strangers which he brought with him to see the magnificence of his court. But now shal you heare howe they were intertained. Among other triumphes and syghtes, two are especially to be noted: Fyrst, there mette them a company of .xxx. women,<note place="margin">The kinges wiues.</note> beyng al the kynges wyues and concubines, bearyng in theyr handes branches of date trees, singyng and daunsyng: they were all naked, sauyng that theyr pryuie partes were couered with breeches of gossampine cotton: but the virgins, hauyng theyr heare hangyng downe about their shoulders, tyed about the forehead with a fyllet, were vtterly naked. They affirme that theyr faces, breastes, pap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes, handes,<note place="margin">Well fauored women.</note> and other partes of theyr bodyes, were exceedyng
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:22913:41"/>
smothe, and well proportioned, but somwhat inclynyng to a loue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly broune. They supposed that they had seene those most beuty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>Dryades,</hi> or the natyue nymphes or fayres of the fountaynes whereof the antiques spake so muche.<note place="margin">Driades.</note> The braunches of date trees, which they bore in theyr right handes when they daunced, they delyuered to the Lieuetenaunt, with lowe curtesy and smy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng countenaunce. Thus enteryng into the kynges house, they founde a delycate supper prepared for them, after theyr maner. When they were well refreshed with meate, the nyght drawyng on, they were brought by the kynges officers, euery man to his lodgyng, according to his degree, in certayne of theyr houses about the pallaice, where they rested them in hangyng beddes, after the maner of the countrey, wherof we haue spoken more largely in an other place.</p>
                     <p>The day folowyng, they brought our men to their common hall, into the whiche they come togeather as often as they make any notable games or triumphes, as we haue sayde before. Here, after many daunsynges, synginges, maskinges, runnynges,<note place="margin">A pretie pastyme.</note> wrestlyngs, and other trying of mastryes, sodaynly there appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in a large plaine neere vnto the hal, two great armies of men of warre, whiche the kyng for his pastyme had caused to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, as the Spaniardes vse the playe with reedes, which they call <hi>Iuga de Canias.</hi> As the armies drewe neere togeather, they assayled the one the other as fiersely, as if mortall enimies with theyr baners spleade, should fight for theyr goodes, theyr landes, theyr lyues, theyr libertie, theyr countrey, theyr wyues &amp; theyr children, so that within the momente of an houre, foure men were slayne, and many wounded.<note place="margin">Foure men slayne in sport</note> The battayle also shoulde haue contynued longer, yf the kyng had not, at the request of our men, caused them to ceasse. The thyrde day, the Lieuetenant coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saylyng the kyng to sowe more plentie of gossampine vppon the bankes neere vnto the waters syde, that they myght the better paye theyr trybute pryuately, accordyng to the multitude of theyr houses, he prepayred to <hi>Isabella,</hi> to vysite the sycke men whiche he had lefte there, and also to see howe his woorkes went forwarde. In the tyme of his absence .xxx. of his men were consumed with diuerse diseases.<note place="margin">Prouision for diseased men.</note> Wherefore beyng sore troubled in his mynde, and in maner at his wyttes ende,
<pb facs="tcp:22913:42"/>
what he were best to doo, for as muche as he wanted al thynges necessarie, as wel to restore them to health whiche were yet acrased, as also vitayles to mayntayne y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole multitude, where as there was yet no shyppe come from Spayne: at the length, he determyned to sende abrode the sicke men here and there to sundrye Regyons of the ilande, and to the castelles whiche they had erected in the same. For directly from the citie of Isabella to saynt Dominikes towre, that is, from the north to the south, through the ilande,<note place="margin">The castels or towers of hispaniola.</note> they had buylded thus many castles. Fyrst, xxxvi. myles distant from Isabella, they buylded the castell of <hi>Sperantia.</hi> From <hi>Sperantia</hi> .xxv. myles, was the castell of saynt Katharine. From saynt Katharines .xx. myles, was saynt Iames towre. Other .xx. myles from saynt Iames towre, was a strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er fortresse then any of the other, whiche they called the towre of Conception, which he made the stronger, because it was situat at the rootes of the golden mountaynes of Cibana, in the great and large playne,<note place="margin">The golden mountaynes of Cibana.</note> so fruiteful and well inhabited as we haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore described. He buylded also an other in the mydde waye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene the towre of Conception, &amp; saynt Dominikes towre, the whiche also was stronger then the towre of Conception, because it was within the lymittes of a great kyng, hauyng vnder his dominion fiue thousande men, whose chiefe citie and head of the Realme, beyng called <hi>Bonauum,</hi> he wylled that the castell should also be called after the same name. Therefore leauyng the sicke men in these castels, and other of the ilande houses nere vnto the same, he hym selfe repayred to saynt Dominikes, exacting trybutes of al the kynges whiche were in his way. When he had taryed there a fewe dayes, there was a rumour spredde, that all the kynges about the borders of the towre of Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, had conspyred with desperate myndes to rebell agaynst the Spaniardes.<note place="margin">The kinges rebell.</note> When the Lieutenaunt was certified hereof, he tooke his iourney towarde them immediately, not beyng discoraged eyther by the length of the waye, or feeblenesse of his souldyers, beyng in maner foreweried with trauayle. As he drewe nere vnto them, he had aduertysement that kyng <hi>Guarionexius</hi> was chosen by other prynces to be the Capitayne of this rebellion, and that he was enforsed therto halfe vnwyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng, beyng seduced by perswasions and prouocations: the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:22913:42"/>
whiche is more lykely to be true, for that he had before had experience of the power and policie of our men. They came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather at a daye appoynted, accompanyed with .xv. thousande men, armed after their manner,<note place="margin">An army of xv. thousand Barbarians.</note> once agayne to proue the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of warre. Here the Lieutenaunt, consultyng with the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne of the fortresse and the other souldiers of whom he had the conducte, determyned to sette vpon them vnwares in their owne houses, before they coulde prepare theyr army. He sent foorth therefore to euery kyng a Centurion, that is, a captayne of a hundred, which were commaunded vpon a sudden to inuade theyr houses in the nyght, and to take them sleepyng, before the people (being scattred here &amp; there) myght assemble togeather. Thus secretly enteryng into their vyllages, not fortified with walles,<note place="margin">The kinges are taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners.</note> trenches, or bulwarks, they broke in vpon them, toke them, bound them, &amp; led away euery man his prisoner according as they were commaunded. The Lieuetenant hym selfe with his hundred men, assayled kyng <hi>Guarionexius</hi> as the worthier personage, whom he tooke prysoner, as did the other captaines theyr kings, and at the same houre appoynted. Foureteene of them were brought the same nyght to the towre of Conception. Shortlye after, when he had put to death two of the kynges whiche were the chiefe autours of this newe reuolte,<note place="margin">king Guari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onexius is pardoned.</note> and had suborned <hi>Guario<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexius</hi> &amp; the other kynges to attempt the same, least the people for sorowe of theyr kinges shoulde neglecte or forsake their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, whiche thyng myght haue ben great incommoditie to our men, who by thincrease of theyr seedes and fruites were often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes ayded, he freely pardoned and dismissed <hi>Guarionexius</hi> and the other kynges, the people in the meane tyme flocking togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about the towre, to the number of fyue thousande without weapons, with pitiful houling for the deliuerance of their kinges: The ayre thundered, &amp; the earth trembled through the vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of theyr outcry. The Lieutenaunt warned <hi>Guarionexius</hi> and the other kynges, with threatenynges, with rewardes, and with promyses, neuer thereafter to attempt any suche thyng. Then <hi>Guarionexius</hi> made an oration to the people, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great power of our men, of theyr clemencie towarde offenders, &amp; liberalitie to suche as remaine faithfull, desyring them to quiet theyr mindes, and from thencefoorth neyther in deede nor thought to interpryse

any thyng agaynst the Chrystians, but to obeye and serue them, excepte they woulde dayly bryng them selues into further cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities. When the oration was fynyshed, they tooke hym vp, and set hym on theyr shoulders, and so caryed hym home to his owne pallace: and by this meanes, this Region was paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed for a whyle. But our men, with heauy countenaunce wandered vp and downe, as desolate in a strange countrey, lack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng vittailes, and worne out of apparell, whereas .xv. monethes were nowe passed sence the Admirals departure,<note place="margin">Lacke of vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayles.</note> duryng which tyme, they coulde heare nothyng out of Spayne. The Lieue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunt comforted them all that he coulde with fayre wordes and promyses. In the meane tyme, <hi>Beuchius Anacauchoa</hi> (the kyng of the West partes of the Region of <hi>Xaragua</hi> (of whom we spake before) sent messengers to the Lieuetenaunt, to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fye vnto hym, that he had in a redynes the gossampine cotton, and suche other thynges as he wylled hym to prepare for the payment of his trybute. Whereupon the Lieuetenaunt tooke his iourney thyther, and was honorably receiued of the kyng and his syster, somtyme the wyfe of <hi>Caunaboa</hi> the kyng of <hi>Cibana,</hi> bearyng no lesse rule in the gouernaunce of her brothers kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, then he hym selfe: For they affirmed her to be a wyse woman, of good maners, &amp; pleasaunt in company.

and quaked for feare, supposyng that the frame of the worlde had ben in daunger of fallyng, but when they sawe the Lieuetenant laugh, and looke chearefully on them, they called agayne theyr spirites, and when they yet drewe nearer to the shyp, and hearde the noyse of the fluites, shawlmes, and drummes, they were won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully astonied at the sweete harmonie thereof.<note place="margin">Musical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentes.</note> Entryng into the shyppe, and beholdyng the foreshyp and the sterne, the toppe castel, the maste, the hatches, the cabbens, the keele, and the tack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynges, the brother fyxyng his eyes on the syster,<note place="margin">Ignorance cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> and the syster on the brother, they were both as it were dumme and amazed, and wyste not what to say for to muche woondryng. Whyle beholdyng these thyngs, they wandered vp and downe the ship, the Lieutenaunt commaunded the ankers to be loosed, and the sayles to be hoysed vp. Then were they further astonyshed, when they saw so great a mole to mooue as it were by it selfe, without ores, and without the force of man: for there arose from the earth suche a wynde, as a man woulde haue wyshed for of purpose. Yet furthermore, when they perceiued the shippe to mooue sometime forwarde, and sometyme backward, sometyme toward the right hande, and sometyme towarde the lefte, and that with one winde, and in manner at one instant, they were at theyr wyttes ende for to much admiration. These thynges finished, and the shippes la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with bread, and suche other rewardes, they beyng also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced with other of our thynges, he dismissed not onely the kyng <hi>Beuchius Anachauchoa</hi> and his syster, but lykewise all theyr seruauntes &amp; women, replenished with ioye &amp; wondering.

These mountaynes, and also the inhabitauntes of the same, they call by one name, <hi>Ciguaios.</hi> The great king of all the kinges and regions of these mountaynes is called <hi>Maio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banexius,</hi> and his court or pallace is named <hi>Capronus:</hi> the mountaynes are rough, high, and such as no man can passe to the toppes therof, they are also bending, and haue their corners reaching downe to the sea. Betweene both the corners of the mountaynes, is there a greate playne, by the whiche many ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers fall from the mountaynes into the sea, the people are verye fierse and warlike men, hauing theyr original of the Canibales: for when they descend from the mountaynes to the playnes, to keepe warre with theyr borderers, they eate all such as they kil. <hi>Guarionexius</hi> therfore, fleeing to this kyng of these mountaynes, gaue him many presentes of such thinges as are wanting in his countrey, therwith declaring how vilely, villanously, and violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he had ben vsed of our men, with whom he coulde nothyng preuaile, neither by fayre meanes, nor by foule, nother by humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, nor by stoutnesse, and that to be the cause of his resorting, to hym at that tyme, most humbly desyring him to be his defence agaynst thoppressions of suche myscheuous people. <hi>Maioba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexius</hi> hereuppon, made hym promisse to ayde and helpe hym against the Christians al that he might. The Lieutenant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made haste to the fortresse of Conception, whither, as soone as he was come, he sent for <hi>Roldanus Xeminus,</hi> who with suche as folowed hym, lay in certayne of the Iland villages, xii. myles distant from the fortresse. At his commyng, the Lieuetenaunt asked him what al these sturres and tumultes meant? He answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red without abashment, Your brother the Admiral hath to doo therewith, and shall aunswere for the fame before the kyng, for we perceiue that the kyng hath so put hym in trust, that he hath had no regarde to vs: here we peryshe for hunger, whyle we folowe you, and are dryuen to seeke our vnhappye foode in the desartes: Your brother also assigned me assystaunt with you in gouernyng the Ilande. Wherefore, syth you haue na more

respecte vnto vs, we are determined no longer to be vnder your obedience. When <hi>Roldanus</hi> had spoken these wordes, and suche other, the Lieuetenaunt woulde haue layde handes on hym, but he escaped his fyngers, and fledde to the West partes of the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Xaragua,</hi> hauyng with hym a trayne of threescore and ten men, whiche were of his confederacie. Here this fylthy synke of rebelles thus conspired, playde theyr vages, and lyued with loose brydles in al kynde of myscheefe, robbyng the people,<note place="margin">Licenciousnesse in libertie.</note> spoyling the countrey, and rauishyng both wyues and virgins. Whyle these thynges were dooing in the Ilande, the Admiral had eight shippes appoynted him by the kyng, of the whiche he sent two laden with vyttualles, from <hi>Cales</hi> or <hi>Gades</hi> of Hercules pyllers,<note place="margin">Hercules pyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers.</note> directly to the Lieuetenant his brother. These shyps by chaunce arryued fyrst on that syde of the Ilande where <hi>Roldanus Xemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> ranged with his companions. <hi>Roldanus</hi> in short tyme had se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them, promysyng them in the steede of mattockes,<note place="margin">A violent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion.</note> wen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches pappes: for labour, pleasure: for hunger, abundance: and for weerynesse and watching, sleepe and quietnesse.<note place="margin">The furie of Guarionexius.</note>

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:22913:46"/>
to abide that extremitie of heate. Here the north pole was eleuate onely .v. degrees from the Hozizontall. For the space of .viii. dayes, in the which he suffered these extremites, onely the fyrst day was fayre, but al the other, clowdy and rayny, yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse feruent hotte: Wherefore it oftentymes repented hym not a litle, that euer he tooke that way. Being tossed in these dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and vexations eyght continuall dayes, at the lengthe an Eastsoutheast wynde arose, and gaue a prosperous blaste to his sayles. Whiche wynde folowing directly towarde the west, he founde the starres ouer that paralell placed in other order, and an other kynde of ayre, as the Admirall hym selfe toilde me. And they al affirme, that within three dayes sayling, they founde most temperate and pleasaunt ayre. The Admiral al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so affirmeth, that from the clime of the great heate and vnholsome ayre, he euer ascended by the backe of the sea, as it were by a hygh mountayne towarde heauen, yet in all this tyme, coulde he not once see any land: But at the length, the day before the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendes of Iuly, the watchman lookyng foorth of the toppe castel of the greatest shippe, cried out aloude for ioy that he espied three exceding hygh mountaynes, exhorting his felowes to be of good cheere, and to put away al pensiuenes: for they were very heauy and sorowfull, as well for the greefe which they susteyned by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of thintollerable heate, as also that their freshe water fayled them, whiche ranne out at the ryftes of the barels, caused by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme heate, as we haue sayd. Thus being wel comforted, they drew to the land, but at theyr fyrst approch they could not aryue, by reason of the shalownes of the sea neere the shore: Yet loking out of theyr shyppes, they myght well perceiue that the Region was inhabyted, and wel cultured, for they sawe very fayre gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, and pleasaunt medowes: from the trees and herbes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, when the mornyng deawes beganne to ryse, there proceaded manye sweete sauoures. Twentie myles distant from hence, they chaunced into a hauen, very apte to harborowe shyppes, but it had no ryuer running into it. Sayling on yet somwhat further, he founde at the length a commodious hauen, wherin he might repayre his shyppes, and make prouision of freshe water and fuel. <hi>Arenalis</hi> calleth this land <hi>Puta.</hi>

beastes feete, of the whiche they founde one dead, muche lyke a goate. The day folowyng, they sawe a Canoa commyng a farre of, hauyng in it foure and twentie young men of goodly corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and high stature,<note place="margin">People of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly corporature, and long heare, neere the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial.</note> al armed with targets, bowes, &amp; arrowes: the heare of theyr heades was long and playne, and cutte on the forehead much after the manner of the Spanyards, their pryuie partes were couered with fyllets of gossampine cotton, of sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry colours enterlaced, &amp; were beside al ouer naked. Here the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral, consydering with him selfe the corporature of this people, and nature of the lande, he beleeued the same to be so muche the nearer heauen, then other regions of the same paralel, and further remooued from the grosse vapours of the vales,<note place="margin">The higher, the colder.</note> and maryshes, howe muche the hyghest toppes of the byggest mountaynes are distant from the deepe vales. For he earnestly affirmeth, that in al that nauigation, he neuer went out of the paralels of Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ope: So great difference is there betweene the nature of thinha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitauntes, and of the soyles of diuers regions, al vnder one clime or paralel, as is to see betweene the people and regions beyng in the fyrme lande of Ethiope, and them of the Ilandes vnder the same clime, hauyng the pole starre eleuate in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same degree. For the Ethiopians are all blacke, hauing theyr heare curled, more like wool then heare: but these people of the Iland of <hi>Puta,</hi> (beyng as I haue sayde vnder the clyme of Ethiope) are white, with long heare, and of yelow colour Wherefore it is apparant, the cause of this so great difference, to be rather by the disposition of the earth, then constitution of heauen. For we knowe, that snowe falleth on the mountaynes of the Equinoctial, or burnt lyne, and the same to endure there continuallye: we knowe lykewyse, that the inhabitauntes of the regions farre di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant from that lyne towarde the north, are molested with great heate. The Admirall, that he myght alure the young men to hym with gentlenesse, shewed them lookyng glasses, fayre and bryght vessels of copper, haukes belles, and suche other thynges vnknowen to them. But the more they were called, so muche the more they suspected craft and deceyte, and fledde backe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde: Yet dyd they with great admiration beholde our men and theyr thynges, but styll hauyng theyr ores in theyr handes redy to flee. When the Admirall sawe that he coulde
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:22913:47"/>
by no meanes allure them by gyftes, he thought to prooue what he coulde do with musicall instrumentes, and therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded that they whiche were in the greatest shyp, should play on theyr drummes and shawlmes.<note place="margin">Musical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentes.</note> But the young men suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing this to be a token of battayle, left theyr ores, &amp; in the twinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng of an eye had theyr arrowes in theyr bowes, and theyr tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets on their armes: and thus directing theyr arrowes towarde our men, stoode in expectation to knowe what this noyse might meane. Our men likewyse preparyng theyr bowes and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, approched towarde them by litle and litle. But they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from the Admirals shyppe, and trusting to the dexteritie of theyr ores, came so neare one of the lesse shyppes, that one of them plucked the cloke from the gouernour of the shyppe, and as wel as they coulde by signes, required hym to come alande, promisyng fayth that they woulde commune with him of peace. But when they sawe him goe to the Admirals shyp, whyther he went to aske leaue that he might commune with them, suspecting hereby some further deceyt, they leapt immediatlye into the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noa, and fleedde as swyft as the wynde, so that to conclude, they could by no meanes be allured to familiaritie: Wherfore the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral thought it not conuenient to bestowe any long time there at this voyage. No great space from this Ilande, euer towarde the West,<note place="margin">The violent course of the water from the East to the West.</note> the Admiral sayth he found so outragious a fal of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, runnyng with suche a violence from the East to the West, that it was nothyng inferior to a myghtie streame fallyng from hygh mountaynes. He also confessed, that synce the fyrst day that euer he knewe what the sea meant, he was neuer in suche feare. Proceedyng yet somewhat further in this daungerous voyage, he founde certayne gulfes of eyght myles, as it had ben the entraunce of some great hauen, into the whiche the sayde violent streames dyd fall. These gulfes or streyghtes he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Os Draconis,</hi> that is, the Dragons mouth: and the Ilande directly oueragaynst the same, he called <hi>Margarita.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The gulfe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Os Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conis.</note> Out of these strayghtes, issued no lesse force of freshe water, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che encounteryng with the salte, dyd stryue to passe foorth, so that betweene both the waters, was no small conflycte: But entryng into the gulfe, at the length he founde the water thereof verye freshe and good to drynke. The Admirall
<pb facs="tcp:22913:48"/>
hym selfe, and they which were his companions in this byoage, beyng men of good credit, and perceauing my dilygence in searchyng for these matters, tolde me yet of a greater thyng, that is,<note place="margin">A sea of fresh water.</note> that for the space of .xxvi. leagues, amountyng to a hundreth and foure myles, he sayled euer by freshe water, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the further he proceaded, especially towarde the west, he affirmed the water to be the fresher. After this, he came to a highe mountayne inhabited onely with Monkeyes or Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masits,<note place="margin">Marmasets. Monkeyes.</note> on that part towarde the East: For that syde was rowgh with rockye and stony mountaynes, and therefore not inhabited with men. Yet they that went a lande to searche the countrey, founde nere vnto the sea, many fayre fieldes, well tylled and sowen, but no people, nor yet houses or cotages: Parhappes they were gone further into the countrey, to sowe theyr corne, and applye theyr husbandry, as wee often see our husbandemen to leaue theyr stations and villages for the same purpose. In the west syde of that mountayne, they espyed a large playne, whither they made hast, and cast anker in the brode ryuer. As soone as the inhabitantes had knowledge that a strange nation was arryued in theyr coastes,<note place="margin">The fayre and large region of Paria.</note> they came flockyng without all feare to see our men. We vnderstode by theyr sygnes and poyntynges, that this Region was called <hi>Paria,</hi> and that it was very large: in so muche that the further it reacheth towarde the weste, to be so muche the better inhabited and replenished with people. The Admiral therfore, takyng into his shippe foure of the men of that lande, searched the west partes of the same. By the temperatenes of the ayer, the pleasau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tnes of the ground, and the multitude of people which they sawe daily more &amp; more as they sayled, they coniectured that these thynges portended some great matter: as in deede their opinion failed them not, as we will further declare in his place. The sonne not yet rysen, but beginnyng euen nowe to ryse, being one day allured by the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sauntnes of the place, and sweete sauours whiche breathed from the lande to the shyppes, they went a lande: Here they founde a greater multytude of people, then in any other place. As our men approched towarde them, there came certeine messengers from their <hi>Cacici,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Humane people.</note> that is, the kinges of the countrey, to desyre the Admirall in the name of theyr princes to come to theyr palaces
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:22913:48"/>
without feare, and that they and al theyrs shoulde bee at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement. When the Admirall had thanked them, and made his excuse for that tyme, there came innumerable people with theyr boates to the shyppes, hauyng for the most parte cheynes about theyr neckes, garlandes on theyr heades, and braselettes on theyr armes of pearles of India, and that so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monlye, that our women in playes and tryumphes, haue not greater plentie of stones of glasse and crystall in theyr garlands, crownes, girdels, and suche other tyrementes. Beyng asked where they gathered them, they poynted to the next shore by the sea bankes. They signified also, by certeyne scornefull iestures whiche they made with theyr mouthes and handes, that they no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng esteemed pearles. Taking also baskettes in their handes, they made signes that the same myght be fylled with them in shorte space. But because the corne wherwith his shyppes were laden to be caryed into <hi>Hispaniola,</hi> had taken hurt by reason of the salt water, he determined to deferre this marte to a more conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient tyme: Yet he sent to land two of the shyp boates laden with men, to thintent to fetch some garlands of pearles for exchange of our thynges, and also somwhat to searche the nature of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and disposition of the people. They enterteyned our men gentelly, and came flocking to them by heapes, as it had ben to beholde some strange monsters. Fyrst there came to meete our men, two men of grauitie, whom the multitude folowed: One of these was well in age, and the other but young. They thinke it was the father, with his sonne whiche should succeede hym. When the one had saluted and embrased the other, they brought our men into a certeyne rounde house, neere vnto the whiche was a great courte.<note place="margin">Chayers and stooles of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bene.</note> Hyther were brought many chayers and stooles made of a certeyne blacke wood, and very cunnyngly wrought. After that our men and theyr Princes were sette, theyr waytyng men came in laden, some with sundry delycate dysihes, and some with wyne: But theyr meat, was only fruites, and those of dyuers kyndes, and vtterly vnknowen to vs. Theyr wyne was both whyte and redde, not made of grapes, but of the lycour of dyuers fruites, and very pleasaunte in drynkyng. After this banquet made in the olde mans house, the young man brought them to his tabernacle or mantion place, where
<pb facs="tcp:22913:49"/>
was a great company both of men and women, but they stoode disseuered the one from the other. They are whyte, euen as our men are,<note place="margin">Whyte men neere the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall.</note> sauing suche as are much conuersant in the sunne. They are also very gentle, and full of humanitie towarde stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. They couer theyr priuie partes with gossampine cotton, wrought with sundry colours, and are besyde all naked. There was fewe, or none, that had not eyther a coller, a chayne, or a bracelet of golde and pearles, and many had all. Beyng as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked where they had that golde, they poynted to certayne moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes, seemyng with theyr countenaunce to disswade our men from goyng thither: For putting theyr armes in theyr mouthes, and grynnyng as though they bytte the same, styll poyntyng to the mountaynes, they seemed to insinuate that men were eaten there: but whether they meant by the Canibales, or wylde beastes, our men coulde not wel perceiue. They tooke it excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng greeuouslye, that they coulde neyther vnderstande our men, nor our men them. When they whiche were sent to lande, were returned to the shyppes about three of the clocke at after noone the same day, bryngyng with them certayne garlandes, and collers of pearles, they loosed theyr ankers to departe, min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng to come agayne shortlye, when all thynges were set in good order in <hi>Hispaniola:</hi> but he was preuented by another, whiche defeated him of the rewarde of his trauayle.

Wheras now the Lieuetenauntes souldiers were fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weryed with long warre, with watching, laboure, and hunger (for it was nowe three monethes sence the warres began) many desyred leaue to departe to the towre of Conception, where they had graneges, &amp; exercised tillage. He gaue them their passeports with alowance of vittayles, and so that onely thyrtie remayned with hym. These three monethes warre, they contynued very paynefull and myserablye: So that duryng al that tyme, they had none other meate but only <hi>Cazibi,</hi>

These he enforced to declare where theyr lorde lay hid, &amp; vsed the same also for guides, to bring our men to the place. Twelue of our men tooke this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpryse in hand, painting them selues after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maner of the Cig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauians: So that by this stratageme or policie, they came soden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vppon <hi>Maiobanexius,</hi>

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:22913:53"/>
suche tyme as <hi>Guarionexius</hi> went from the playnes to the mountaynes, and then sodenly to entrappe hym. They went as they were commaunded, tooke hym, and brought hym away with them, and by this meanes were al the regions neare about pacified and quieted. A certayne noble woman of neare kynred to <hi>Maiobanexius,</hi> and wyfe to another kyng, whose dominion was yet vntouched, folowed hym in all these aduersities. They affirme this woman to be the fayrest and most beautifull, that euer nature brought foorth in the Iland: Whom,<note place="margin">A beautifull woman.</note> when the king her husbande, who loued her most ardently (as her beautie deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued) hearde say that she was taken prysoner, he wandered vp and downe the desartes lyke a man out of his wytte, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng what to doo or say. But at the length, he came to the Lieutenaunt, promisyng most faythfullye, that he woulde sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him selfe and al that he coulde make, vnder his power, so that he woulde restore hym his wyfe. The Lieutenaunt accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the condition, &amp; restored him his wife, with certaine other ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and gentlemen which he had taken prysoners before: char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them, and bynding them with an othe, to be euer redy at his commaundement. Shortly after, this king of his owne free motion, came agayne to the Lieutenaunt, bryngyng with him fyue thousande men without weapons, sauyng only suche instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes as they vse in tyllage of theyr ground. He brought with hym also seedes to sowe, wherwith at his owne charge, he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed such plentie of theyr corne and fruites to growe in sundry pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the larg vale, wherof we spake before, that shortly after, were seene many fayre and fruitfull feeldes that came therof: and for his gentelnesse being rewarded of the Lieuetenaunte with certayne of our thynges, he departed ioyfullye. When the report hereof came to the Ciguauians,<note place="margin">The kynges submit them selues to the Lieuetenaunt.</note> it mooued the mindes of the kynges to hope of clemencie, whereuppon they came together to the Lieuetenaunt with humble submission and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full promyse, euer after to be vnder his obedience, desyryng hym to restore vnto them theyr kyng with his familie. At theyr request, the kynges wyfe and his housholde was set at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but the king kept styl as a prysoner.

Spaine: who being disquieted with theyr quarelinges and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations, and especially for that by reason of theyr discention, of so greate abundance of golde and other thynges, there was as yet but lyttle brought into Spayne, appoynted a newe gouernour, which shoulde see a redresse in these thynges:<note place="margin">A newe gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Ilande.</note> and eyther to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyshe such as were fautie, or els to sende them to him. What was founde agaynst the Admirall and his brother, or agaynst his aduersaries which accused hym, I do not well knowe. But this I am sure of, that both the brethren are taken, brought, and caste in prison, with theyr goodes confiscate. But as soone as the king vnderstode that they were brought bounde to Cales, he sent messengers in poste, with commaundement that they should be loosed and come freely to his presence: wherby he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that he toke their troubles greeuously. It is also said, that the new gouernour sent letters to the kyng, written with the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralles hand in straunge and vnknowen sypheringes, to his brother the Lieuetenaunt being absent, wyllyng hym to be in a redynes with a power of armed men to come and ayd hym, if the Gouernoure should proffer hym any violence. Wherof the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour hauing knowledge (as he sayth) beyng also aduertised that the Lieuetenaunt was gone to his brother before the men whiche he had prepared were in a redines, apprehended them both vnwares, before the multitude came togeather.

come to the shyp with their <hi>Canoas</hi>: for their boates (which the men of the iland cal <hi>Canoas</hi>) are made only of one whole peece of wood as in the Ilandes, yet more rude, and not so artificially as theyrs are: these they call <hi>Gallitas.</hi> These swarmed therfore to the shyp as faste as they might, bringyng with them greate plenty of pearles (which they cal <hi>Tenoras</hi>) exchanging the same for our marchaundies. He founde this people to be of gentyll nature, simple, and innocent, being conuersant with them in theyr houses, for the space of xx. dayes. Theyr houses are made of wood, couered with the leaues of date trees. Their meate for the moste parte, is the shelfyshes in the which the pearles are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendered,<note place="margin">Shel fyshes in which pearles are engendred.</note> wherof their sea costes are full. They haue also greate plenty of wyld beastes, as hartes, wyld bores, and connies like vnto hares, both in coloure and bignesse, stocke doues also, and turtle doues: lykewyse geese and duckes, which they norishe in theyr houses as we doo. Peacockes flee aboute in maner in euery wood and groue, but they are not distinct with sundry co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours as ours are: for the cockes are like vnto the hennes. These people of <hi>Curiana</hi> are craftie hunters, and exceding cunning ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, so that they will not lyghtly misse any beaste or byrde that they shoote at. Our men consumed certayne dayes heare very plesauntely: duryng which time, whosoeuer brought them a peacocke, had for the same foure pinnes: he that brought a phea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saunte,<note place="margin">Theyr manner of bargayning.</note> had two, and for a stocke doue, or turtle doue, one, and for a goose, a smale looking glasse, or a litle stone of glasse. Thus they bought and solde with profering and bydding, denying and refusing, as it had byn in a greate market. When pinnes were profered them, they asked what they shoulde do with them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing naked: But our men satisfied them with a craftie answere, declaring by tokens that they were very necessary,<note place="margin">The vse of pynnes.</note> to picke theyr teeth, and to pull thornes out of theyr fleshe.

naked, with theyr bowes and arrowes, yet hath it not ben harde of, that any man hath ben slayne of any wylde beast. As many hartes or wylde bores as our men woulde desyre them to bryng, they woulde kyll in the woodes with their arrowes,<note place="margin">Hartes and wylde bores.</note> and not to fayle to bryng them. They lacke kyne, goates and sheepe. Theyr bread is made of rootes, as is theyrs of the Ilands. This nation, hath blacke heare, grosse and somwhat curlde, yet long also. They keepe theyr teeth very whyte, and for that purpose vse to cary a certaine herbe betwene theyr lyppes for the most part of the day, and to washe theyr mouthts when they cast it away. The women doo all theyr busynes at home in theyr how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and haue also the cure of tyllage of the grounde: but the men apply them selues to the warres and huntyng, to playe, syng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng and daunsyng. They haue sundry kyndes of water pottes, iugges, and drinkyng cuppes made of earth in other places about them, and brought thyther for exchaung of other thynges: For they vse fayres and markettes for the same purpose, and are greatly desyrous of such thynges, as are not brought forth or made in theyr countrey, as nature hath geuen a disposytion to al men, to desyre and be delyted with newe and strang thynges. Many of them had hangyng at theyr pearles the images of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine beastes and birdes, very artifitiously made of golde,<note place="margin">Cunnyng ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers.</note> but not pure: these also are brought them from other places for exchang of other thynges.

The great wylde beastes wherof we spake before, and many other thynges which are not found in any of the Ilandes, testifie that this region is parte of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> continet or firme lande. But the chiefest coniecture wherby they argue the same, is,<note place="margin">Tokens of the continent or firme lande.</note> that by the coastes of that lande, from <hi>Paria</hi> towarde the west, they sayled about three. M. myles, findyng no signe or token of any ende. These people of <hi>Curiana</hi> (whiche some call <hi>Curtana</hi>) being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded where they had such plentie of golde, signified that it
<pb facs="tcp:22913:56"/>
was brought them from a region called <hi>Canchieta,</hi>

Whereupon our men directed theyr voyage thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther immediatly, and aryued there at the Kalendes of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uember, in the yeere of Christe a thousande and fyue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. The people of the countrey resorted to them without feare, bryngyng with them of the golde whiche we sayde to be natiue in that region. This people had also collers of pearles about theyr neckes, which were brought them from <hi>Curiana</hi> for exchaunge of theyr marchandises. None of them woulde ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunge anye of those thynges whiche they had out of other countreys: as neyther the Curians golde, nor the Canchietans pearles: yet among the Canchietans they founde but lytle golde redy geathered. They toke with them from thence certayne very fayre Marmasets or Munkeyes, and many Popyngayes of sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drye coloures. In the moneth of Nouember, the ayre was there most temperate, and nothyng colde. The guardens of the north pole were out of syght to both these people, they are so neare the Equinoctial.<note place="margin">The Equinoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial line.</note> Of the degrees of the pole, they can geue none other accompte. These people are wel disposed men, of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest conditions, and nothyng suspitious, for almost al the nyght long they resorted to the shyppe with theyr boates, and went aboorde shyppe without feare, as dyd the Curians. They call pearles, <hi>Corixas.</hi> They are somewhat ielous, for when anye straungers come among them, they euer place theyr women be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hynde them. In this region of <hi>Canchieta,</hi> the gossampine trees growe of them selues commonly in many places,<note place="margin">Gossampine trees.</note> as doo with vs elmes, wyllowes, and sallowes: and therefore they vse to make breeches of cotton, wherewith they couer theyr priuie partes in many other regions thereabout. When they had yet sayled on forwarde by the same coastes, there came forth against them about two thousande men, armed after theyr manner, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byddyng them to come alande. These people were so rude and sauage, that our men coulde by no meanes allure them to fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaritie.

And here it seemeth to me not farre from my purpose, to declare what chaunced vnto them in theyr returne when they came now within the sight of the coast of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria.</hi> They happened therfore in the way, at <hi>Os Draconis,</hi> and the gulfes of <hi>Paria</hi> (wherof we spake before) to meete with a nauy of xviii.

When he was demaunded after what sort the Canibales were woont to inuade other countreys, he answered, that they euer vsed to carye with them in theyr Canoas, a great multitude of clubbes, the whiche, wheresoeuer they do lande,<note place="margin">Howe the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibales fortifie their campe.</note> they pytch in the grounde, and encampe them selues within the compasse of the same, to lye the more safely in the nyght season.

In these coastes of <hi>Paria</hi> is a region called <hi>Haraia,</hi> in the which great plentie of salt is geathered after a strange sorte:<note place="margin">Haraia.</note> for the sea beyng there tossed with the power of the wyndes, dryueth the salte waters into a large playne by the sea syde, where, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde when the sea waxeth calme, and the sunne begynneth to shine, the water is coniealed into most pure and whyte salte, wherewith innumerable shyypes myght be laden, yf men dyd

These dryed carcases, they haue in great reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and honour them for theyr houshoulde and famylier gods. They say that in this place they sawe a man, &amp; in an other place a woman, thus dryed and reserued. When they departed from <hi>Curiana,</hi> the .viii. day of the Ides of February, to returne to Spayne, they had threescore and .xvi. poundes weight (after .viii. vnces to the pounde) of pearles, which they bought for exchange of our thinges, amounting to the value of fyue shillinges. Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting therfore, they consumed threescore dayes in theyr iourney (although it were shorter then from <hi>Hispaniola</hi>) by reason of the continuall course of the sea in the west, which dyd not only great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly stey the shippe, but also somtymes dryue it backe.

Yet yf we wel weigh and consyder the largenesse and widenesse of <hi>Boriostomea</hi> and <hi>Spiriostomea,</hi> the mouthes of the famous riuer of <hi>Ister</hi> (nowe called <hi>Danubius</hi>) and howe farre they violate or corrupt the salt water with their freshnesse, we shal ceasse to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyle, although this other riuer be greater: for who can diminish the power of nature, but that it may make this bigger then the other, and another bygger then this? And I suppose this to be the ryuer whereof <hi>Colonus</hi> the Admirall made mention in the description of his voyage in these coastes.

Among these trees is found that monstrous beaste with a snoute lyke a foxe,<note place="margin">A monstrous beast.</note> a tayle lyke a marmasette, eares lyke a bat, handes lyke a man, and feete lyke an ape, bearyng her whelpes aboute with her in an outwarde bellye much lyke vnto a great bagge or purse.

For when they had nowe sailed by the coastes of <hi>Paria</hi> about syxe hundred leagues, &amp; (as they supposed) beyond the citie of <hi>Cathay,</hi> and the costes of East India beyond the riuer of Ganges, there rose sodenly so fierce a tempest in the moneth of Iuly, that of the four Carauels which they had with them, two were drowned euen before theyr eyes: and the thyrd lying at anker, with lyke sodennes caried out of theyr syght throwgh the violence of the tempest: the fourth also lying at anker, was so shaken and broo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that all the seames therof were almost loosed: Yet came they to land out of this last shyp, but vtterly despayryng of the shyp.

Here he sent certayne to goe alande on the shore both to fetch fresh water, &amp; also to repayre the ship boate which was sore bruised. In this meane tyme, a great multitude of the people of the countrey, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med after theyr manner, came about our men, as they were occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyed about theyr busynesse, and stoode in a redynesse to fyght, for the space of three dayes continually, duryng whiche time, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther durst they set vpon our men, nor our men assaile them. Thus both parties keepyng theyr aray, stoode styll three whole dayes, the one gasyng on the other. Yet al this tyme our men applyed theyr woorke, placyng the shypwryghtes in the myddest of theyr armie. As they stoode thus amased, two of our company went to fyll theyr water pottes at the mouth of the ryuer neere vnto them both, where sodenly there came foorth agaynst them a cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne of the barbarians with tenne armed men, whiche inclosed them, and with terrible countenance bent theyr arrowes against them, but shot them not of. One of our men fledde, but the other remayned, callyng his felowe agayne, and rebukyng hym for his fearefulnesse. Then he spake to the barbarians in theyr owne language, whiche he had learned beyng conuersaunt with the captiues that were caryed from thence long before. They marueylyng to heare a stranger speake in theyr natiue tongue, put of theyr fiercenesse, and fell to frendly communication, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundyng who were the captaynes of that company whiche
<pb facs="tcp:22913:72"/>
were aryued in theyr lande. He aunswered that they were strangers passing by, and that he marueyled why they would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to driue them from theyr coastes, and disturbe their shyps: arguyng them of follie and crueltie, and further threatnyng their ruine and destruction, except they woulde vse them selues more frendely towarde them. For he aduertised them that there woulde shortlye come into theyr lande armed men, in number like vnto the sandes of the sea, and that to theyr vtter destruction, not only yf they resysted them not, but also except they receiued them, and entertayned them honourably. In the meane time, <hi>Ancisus</hi> was enfourmed that his men were deteyned: wherefore suspectyng some deceyte,<note place="margin">The vse of tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets agaynst venemous arrowes.</note> he brought foorth all his target men, for feare of theyr venemous arrowes: and settyng them in battel araye, he marched forwarde towarde them whiche stayed his men. But he whiche communed with the barbarians, geuyng hym a signe with his hande to proceede no further, he stayed, and callyng to hym the other, he knewe that all was safe: for the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians profered hym peace, because they were not they whom they suspected them to haue ben, meanyng by <hi>Fogeda</hi> &amp; <hi>Nicuesa,</hi> who had spoyled the vyllage standyng there by the sea syde, and caryed away many captiues, and also burnt another vyllage fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther within the lande. And therefore (as they sayde) the cause of theyr commyng thyther, was to reuenge those iniuries, yf by any meanes they coulde, yet that they woulde not exercise theyr weapons agaynst the innocent:<note place="margin">The barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to iustice.</note> for they sayd, it was vngodly to fyght agaynst any, not beyng prouoked. Laying apart therefore theyr bowes and arrowes, they enterteyned our men gentelly, and gaue them great plentie of salted fyshe,<note place="margin">Salted fyshe.</note> and bread of theyr countrey, and filled theyr vessels with Syder made of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey fruites and seedes, not inferior to wine in goodnesse. Thus <hi>Ancisus</hi> hauing entred into frendship,<note place="margin">Wine of fruites and seedes.</note> and made a league of peace with thinhabitantes of <hi>Caramairi,</hi> which were before sore prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by other captaynes, he lanched from that lande, and directed his course to <hi>Vraba</hi> by the Ilande <hi>Fortis,</hi> hauing in his shippe a hundred and fyftie freshe men, whiche were substitute in the place of suche as were dead: also twelue Mares, and manye swine, and other beastes both males and females for encrease. Lykewyse,<note place="margin">Artyllerie.</note> fyftie peeces of ordinaunce, with great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:22913:72"/>
of targettes, swoordes, iauelyns, and suche other weapons for the warres, but all this with euil speede, and in an euil houre: for as they were euen nowe entryng into the hauen, the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the shyppe whiche sate at the helme, stroke the shyppe vpon the sandes,<note place="margin">Ancisus shyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke.</note> where it was so fast enclosed and beaten with the waues of the sea, that it opened in the myddest, and all lost that was therein, a thyng surelye miserable to beholde: for of all the vyttualles that they had, they saued only twelue barrelles of meale, with a fewe cheeses, and a lytle bysket bread, for al the beastes were drowned, and they them selues escaped hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and halfe naked, by helpe of the Brigandine and ship boate, carying with them only a fewe weapons. Thus they fell from one calamitie into another, beyng nowe more carefull for theyr lyues then for golde. Yet beyng brought alyue and in health to that lande whiche they so greatly desyred, they coulde do no lesse then to prouide for the susteynyng of theyr bodyes, because they coulde not lyue only by ayre: and whereas theyr owne fayled, they must needes lyue by other mens. Yet among these so many aduersities, one good chaunce offered it selfe vnto them: for they founde, not farre from the sea syde, a groue of Date trees, among the which, and also among the reeke or weedes of the marishes,<note place="margin">A groue of date trees.</note> they espyed a multitude of wylde bores, with whose fleshe they fed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues wel certayne dayes.<note place="margin">Wylde bores.</note> These they say to be lesse then ours, and with so short tayles, that they thought they had ben cut of.

But they affirme that they haue prooued by experience, theyr fleshe to be of better taste and more wholsome then ours.

These apples are good to be eaten, and haue a certayne sweetenesse myxte with a gentyll sharpnesse, as haue the fruites called <hi>Sorbes.</hi> Thinhabytantes plant these trees in theyr orchyardes and gardens, and noryshe them with greate diligence as we do cheries, peaches, and quinses. This tree in leaues, heyght, and trunke, is very lyke vnto the tree that bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the fruyte called <hi>Zizipha,</hi> which the Apothecaries call <hi>Iuiuba.</hi> But whereas now the wylde bores began to fayle them, they were agayne enforced to consulte and prouyde for the tyme to come: Whereuppon with theyr whole armye, they entered further into the land. The Canibales of this prouynce, are most expert archers. <hi>Ancisus</hi> had in his companye, a hundred men. They mette by the way with only three men of thinhabitantes,<note place="margin">Men of despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate boldenesse.</note> naked, and armed with bowes &amp; venomous arowes, who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all feare, assayled our men fyercesly, wounded manye, and slue manye, and when they emptyed theyr quiuers, fledde as swyftely as the wynde: For (as we haue saide) they are exceding swyfte of foote by reason of theyr loose gooing from theyr chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des age, they affyrme that they lette slyp no arrowe out of theyr bowes in vayne. Our men therfore returned the same way that they came, muche more vnfortunate then they were before, and consulted among them selues to leaue the land, especialy because the inhabytantes had ouerthrowne the fortresse which <hi>Fogeda</hi> buylded, and had burnt thyrtie houses of the vyllage, as soone as <hi>Pizarrus</hi> and his company lefte of <hi>Fogeda,</hi> and forsaken the land. By this occasion therfore, being dryuen to seeke further, they had intelligence that the west syde of that goulfe of <hi>Vraba,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The gulfe of Vraba.</note> was more fruitfull &amp; better to inhabite. Wherfore, they sent the one halfe of theyr men thither with the brigandine, and left the other neere to the sea syde on the east part. This gulfe, is fourteene myles in breadth, and howe muche the further it entereth into the fyrme lande, it is so much the narower. Into the gulfe of <hi>Vraba,</hi> there fall many ryuers, but one (as they saye) more fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate then the ryuer of <hi>Nilus</hi> in Egypt.<note place="margin">The great riuer of Darien.</note> This ryuer is called <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rien,</hi> vpon the bankes whereof, being very fruitfull of trees and grasse, they entended to plante theyr newe colonye or habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But the inhabytantes marueylyng at the brigandyne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bigger then theyr canoas, and specially at the sayles
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:22913:73"/>
therof, fyrst sent away theyr chyldren and weakesse sort of theyr people with theyr baggage and houshould stuffe, and assembled all suche togeather both men and women, as were meete for the warres. Thus beyng armed with weapons and desperate min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, they stoode in a redynesse to fyght, and taryed the comming of our men vpon a lytle hyll, as it were to take the aduauntage of the grounde: our men iudged them to be about fiue hundred in number. Then <hi>Ancisus</hi> the captayne of our men, and Lieue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunt in the steede of <hi>Fogeda,</hi> settyng his men in order of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle aray, and with his whole company kneeling on his knees, they all made humble prayers to GOD for the victorie, and a vowe to the image of the blessed virgin whiche is honoured in Ciuile, by the name of <hi>Sancta Maria Antiqua,</hi> promysyng to sende her many golden gyftes, and a straunger of that countrey: also, to name the vyllage <hi>Sancta Maria Antiqua</hi> after her name: lykewyse to erecte a temple called by the same name, or at the least to dedicate the king of that prouince his pallace to that vse, if it should please her to assist them in this dangerous enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise.

Then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> captayne commaunding them to be in a redynesse with theyr targets and iauelyns, and the trumpetter to blowe the battayle, they fiercely assayled theyr enimies with a larome: but the naked barbarians, not long able to abyde the force of our men, were put to flight,<note place="margin">The barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are dryuen to flyght.</note> with theyr kyng and captayne <hi>Cemaccus.</hi> Our men entred into the vyllage, where they founde plentie of meate, such as the people of the countrey vse, sufficient to asswage theyr present hunger, as bread made of rootes, with certayne fruites vnlyke vnto ours, whiche they reserue for store, as we doo Chestnuttes. Of these people, the men are vtterly naked, but the women, from the nauel downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde are couered with a fyne cloth made of gossampine cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.

As these thyngs were thus doing in <hi>Beragua,</hi> one of theyr companye standing vpon the top of a high rocke of especiall, and lyftyng his eyes towarde the West, began to crye, Lynnen sayles, lynnen sayles. And the neerer it drewe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde hym, he perceiued it to be a shyp boate, commyng with a lytle sayle: yet receiued they it with muche reioycing, for it was the fysher boate of <hi>Nicuesa</hi> his Carauel, and of capacitie to cary only fyue men, and had nowe but three in it, whiche had stolne it from <hi>Nicuesa,</hi> because he refused to geue credite to them that he had passed <hi>Beragua,</hi> and left it behinde him Eastwarde.

Debatyng therefore with theyr felowes of these matters, they declared how <hi>Nicuesa</hi> erred and lost the Carauel by tempest, and that he was nowe wanderyng among the maryshes of vnknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en coastes, full of miserie and in extreme penurie of all thynges,<note place="margin">The miserable case of Nicuesa</note> hauyng nowe lyued for the space of threescore and tenne dayes, only with herbes and rootes, &amp; seldome with fruites of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, contented to drynke water, and yet that oftentymes fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng, because he was instant to trauayle Westwarde by foote, supposyng by that meanes to come to <hi>Beragua.

Lykewyse he spake to al the vnder officers sharpely, and with a troubled mind, and within fewe dayes after, commaunded them to trusse vp theyr packes, and make them redy to depart. They desyred him to quyet hym selfe, and to forbeare them a whyle, vntyl they had reaped the corne that they had sowen, whiche woulde shortly be rype: for all kynde of corne waxeth rype there euery fourth mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth after it is sowen.<note place="margin">Corne waxeth rype euerye fourth moneth</note> But he vtterly denyed to tarye anye whyt, but that he woulde foorthwith depart from that vnfortunate lande, and plucked vp by the rootes all that euer was brought into the gulfe of <hi>Beragua,</hi> and commaunded them to direct theyr course towarde the East. After they had sayled about the space of sixteene myles, a certaine young man, whose name was Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie, a Genues borne, and of a chylde brought vp with <hi>Colonus,</hi> called to remembraunce that there was a hauen not farre from thence: and to prooue his sayinges true, he gaue his felowes these tokens, that is, that they shoulde fynde vpon the shore, an anker of a lost shyppe halfe couered with sande, and vnder a tree next vnto the hauen a spryng of cleare water.

                        </note> then also for hunger while he builded the towre, of the fewe whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che remayned alyue, he lost two hundred. And thus by litle and lytle, the multitude of seuen hundred, fourescore, and fyue men, was brought nowe to scarcelye one hundred. Whyle <hi>Nicuesa</hi> lyued with these fewe miserable men, there arose a contention among them of <hi>Vraba,</hi> as concernyng the Lieuetenantshyppe: for one <hi>Vascus Nunnez,</hi> by the iudgement of al men, trustyng more to his strength then wit, styrred vp certayne light felowes agaynst <hi>Ancisus,</hi> saying that <hi>Ancisus</hi> had not the kyngs letters patentes for that office, and that it was not sufficient that he was aucthorised by <hi>Fogeda,</hi> and therefore forbode that he should execute the office of the Lieuetenauntshyp, and wylled them to choose certayne of theyr owne companye, by whose counsayle and aucthoritie they myght be gouerned. Thus being diuided into factions, by reason that <hi>Fogeda</hi> theyr captayne came not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne, whom they supposed to be nowe dead of his venemous wound, they contended whether it were best to substitute <hi>Nicue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa</hi> in his place. The wysest sort, suche as were familier with <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuesa,</hi> &amp; could not beare the insolencie of <hi>Vascus Nunnez,</hi> thought it good that <hi>Nicuesa</hi> shoulde be sought out throughout all those coastes: for they had knowledge that he departed from <hi>Beragua,</hi> because of the barrennesse of the grounde, and that by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Ancisus,</hi> and suche other as had made shypwracke, it were possible that he myght wander in some secrete place, and that they coulde not be quiet in theyr myndes, vntyl they knewe the certayntie whether he with his felowes were aliue or dead. But <hi>Vascus Nunnez,</hi> fearyng lest at the commyng of <hi>Nicuesa,</hi> he shoulde not be had in aucthoritie among his felowes, sayd they were mad men to thynke that <hi>Nicuesa</hi> lyued, and although he were alyue, yet that they had no neede of his helpe: for he auouched that there was none of his felowes, that were not
<pb facs="tcp:22913:77"/>
as meete to rule as <hi>Nicuesa.</hi> Whyle they were thus reasonyng to and fro,<note place="margin">The nauigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Roderi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Colmena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</note> one <hi>Rodericus Colmenaris</hi> aryued in those coastes with two great shyppes, hauyng in them threescore freshe men, with great plentie of vyttualles and apparell. Of the nauigation of this <hi>Colmenaris,</hi> I entend to speake somewhat more. He therfore departed from the hauen of <hi>Hispaniola,</hi> called <hi>Beata</hi> (where they prepare and furnyshe them selues whiche make any voyage into these landes) about the Ides of October, in the yeere .1510. and landed the .ix. of Nouember in a region in the large prouince of <hi>Paria,</hi> founde by <hi>Colonus</hi> betwene the hauen <hi>Carthago,</hi> and the region of <hi>Cuchibachoa.</hi> In this voyage, what by the roughnesse of the sea, and fiercenesse of the barbarians, he suffered many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodities: for when his freshe water fayled, he sayled to the mouth of a certayne riuer which thinhabitantes cal <hi>Gaira,</hi> beyng apt to receiue shippes. This riuer had his course from the toppe of an exceedyng hygh mountayne couered with snowe,<note place="margin">An exceedyng high moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne couered with snowe.</note> hygher then the whiche, al the companions of this captayne <hi>Rodericus</hi> say, that they neuer sawe: And that by good reason, yf it were couered with snowe in that region, which is not past ten degrees distant from the <hi>Equinoctial</hi> lyne. As they began to draw water out of theyr shyp boate, a certayne kyng made towarde them, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parelled with vestures of gossampine cotton,<note place="margin">Apparelled men.</note> hauyng twentie noble men in his company apparelled also: which thyng seemed straunge to our men, and not seene before in those parties. The kynges apparell hong loose from his shoulders to his elbowes, and from the gyrdle downewarde, it was much lyke a womans kyrtle, reaching euen to his heeles. As he drewe neere towarde our men, he seemed freendly to admonyshe them to take none of the water of that ryuer, affyrmyng it to be vnwholsome for men, and shewed them that not farre from thence, there was a ryuer, of good water. They came to the ryuer, and endeuouryng to come neere the shore, they were driuen backe by tempest. Also the burbuling of the sand, declared the sea to be but shalow there. They were therefore enforced to returne to the fyrste ryuer where they myght safely cast anker. This kyng layde wayte for our men: for as they were fyllyng theyr barrelles, he set on them with about seuen hundred men (as our men iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged) armed after theyr manner, although they were naked:
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:22913:77"/>
for only the kyng and his noble men were apparelled. They tooke away the shypboate, and broke it in manner to chips: so fiercely assaylyng our men with theyr venemous arrowes, that they slue of them fourtie and seuen,<note place="margin">Spanyardes slayne with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes.</note> before they coulde couer them selues with their targets. For that poyson is of such force, that albeit the woundes were not great, yet they dyed therof im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly, for they yet knewe no remedie agaynst this kynde of poyson, as they after learned of the inhabitauntes of <hi>Hispaniola:</hi> for this Ilande bryngeth foorth an hearbe which quencheth and mortifieth the violent poyson of the hearbe, wherwith theyr ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes are infected, so that it be ministred in tyme.<note place="margin">A remedie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous arrowes</note> Yet of our companye whiche went for water, seuen escaped that conflycte, and hydde them selues in a hollowe tree, lurkyng there vntyll nyght, yet escaped they not the handes of theyr enimies: for the shyppe departed from thence in the nyght season, and left them there, supposyng that they had ben slayne. Thus by manye suche peryls and daungers (which I lyghtly ouerpasse, because I wyll not be tedious to your holynesse) he aryued at the length at the hauen of <hi>Vraba,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The hauen of Vraba.</note> and cast anker at the East syde thereof, from whence not long before, our men departed to the West syde, by reason of the barrennesse of that soyle. When he had continued a whyle in the hauen, and sawe no man styrryng, marueyled at the scilence of the places (for he supposed there to haue found his felowes) he could not coniecture what this should meane: and thereupon began to suspect that eyther they were dead, or that they had changed the place of theyr habitation. To knowe the certayntie hereof, he commaunded all the great ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce, and other small gunnes whiche he had in his shyppes, to be charged, and fyers to be made in the night vpon the toppes of the rockes. Thus the fyers beyng kyndled, he commaunded al the gunnes to be shot of at one instant, by the horrible noyse whereof, the gulfe of <hi>Vraba</hi> was shaken, although it were .xxiiii. myles distant, for so brode is the gulfe. This noyse was hearde of theyr felowes in <hi>Dariena,</hi> and they aunsweared them agayne with mutual fyers. Wherefore, by the folowyng of these fyers, <hi>Colmenaris</hi> brought his shippes to the West syde. Here those wretched and miserable men of <hi>Dariena,</hi> whiche nowe through famyne and feeblenesse, helde theyr weerie soules in theyr teeth,

They spoyled his vyllage, and mitigated theyr hunger with such vyttuals as they founde there: yet coulde they

not helpe theyr felowes therewith, by reason of the farre distance of the place, although they had great plentie: for the vyllage of <hi>Poncha</hi> was more then a hundred myles dystant from <hi>Dariena,</hi> whereas was also none other remedie, but that the same shoulde haue ben caryed on mens backes to the sea syde, beyng farre of, where they left theyr shyppes in the whiche they came to the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage of <hi>Careta.</hi> Here they founde certayne poundes weight of gold, grauen &amp; wrought into sundry ouches. After the sackyng of this vyllage, they resorted toward the ships, intending to leaue the kynges of the inlande vntouched at this tyme, and to inuade only them which dwelt by the sea coastes.

This kyng <hi>Comogrus</hi> had seuen sonnes, young men, of comely fourme and stature, which he had by sundry wyues. His pallace was framed of postes or proppes made of trees fastened together after a strange sort,<note place="margin">The kynges pallace.</note> and of so strong buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that it is of no lesse strength then walles of stone.

Thus entryng into the vyllage whiche they had chosen to inhabite, they had knowledge that <hi>Valdiuia</hi> was returned within sixe monethes after his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, but with no great plentie of vyttualles, because he brought but a smal shyppe: yet with hope that shortly after, there shoulde be sent them abundance of vyttualles, and a newe supplye of men. For young <hi>Colonus</hi> the Admiral, and viceroy of <hi>Hispaniola,</hi> and the other gouernours of the Ilande, acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged that hytherto they had no respect to them of <hi>Dariena,</hi> because they supposed that <hi>Ancisus</hi> the Lieuetenaunt had safely arryued there with his shyppe laden with vyttualles: wylling them from hencefoorth to be of good cheare, and that they shoulde lacke no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng hereafter, but that at this present tyme they had no bigger ship wherby they myght send them greater plentie of necessaries by <hi>Valdiuia.</hi> The vyttuals therfore which he brought, serued ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther somwhat to mitigate theyr present necessitie, then to satisfie theyr lacke. Wherefore, within a fewe dayes after <hi>Valdiuia</hi> his returne, they fel agayne into lyke scarcenesse: especially foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muche as a great storme and tempest whiche came from the hygh mountaynes, with horrible thunder and lyghtnyng in the moneth of Nouember,<note place="margin">Horrible thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and lyght<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng in the moneth of Nouember.</note> brought with it suche a floodde, that it partly caryed away, and partly drowned al the corne and seedes which they had sowen in the moneth of September, in a fruite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full grounde before they went to kyng <hi>Comogrus.</hi> The seedes whiche they of <hi>Hispaniola</hi> call <hi>Maizium,</hi> and they of <hi>Vraba</hi> call <hi>Hobba,</hi> whereof they make theyr bread, whiche also we sayde to be rype thryse euery yeere, because those regions are not bytten with the sharpenesse of wynter by reason of theyr neerenesse to the Equinoctial lyne.

Beyng therefore thus frustrate of the increase of theyr seedes, and the kynges neere about them, spoyled of both vyttualles

and golde, they were enforced to seeke theyr meate further of, and therwith to signyfie to the gouernours of <hi>Hispaniola</hi> with what great necessitie they were oppressed, and what they had learned of <hi>Comogrus</hi> as concernyng the Regions towarde the South, willyng them in consideration thereof, to aduertise the kyng to send them a thousande souldiers, by whose helpe they myght by force make waye through the mountaynes, diuidyng the sea on both sydes, if they coulde not bryng the same to passe quietly. The same <hi>Valdiuia</hi> was also sent on this message, cary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with hym to the kynges treasurers (hauing theyr office of receipt in <hi>Hispaniola</hi>) three hundred poundes weyght of golde, after eyght ounces to the pounde, for the fyft portion due to the kynges excheker. This pound of eight ounces, the Spaniardes call <hi>Marcha,</hi> whiche in weight amounteth to fyftye peeces of golde called <hi>Castellani,</hi> but the Castilians call a pounde <hi>Pesum.</hi> We conclude therefore, that the summe hereof, was .xv. thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand of those peeces of gold called <hi>Castellani.</hi> And thus is it appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent by this accompt, that they receiued of the barbarous kinges, a thousande and fyue hundred poundes, of eyght ounces to the pounde: all the whiche they founde readye wrought in sundrye kyndes of ouches, as cheynes, braselets, tablets, and plates, both to hang before theyr brestes, and also at theyr eares, and nosethryls. <hi>Valdiuia</hi> therfore tooke shypping in the same Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell in the which he came last, and returned also before the thyrde day of the Ides of Ianuary, in the yeere of Christe M.D.XI. What chaunced to hym in this voyage, we wyll declare in place conuenient. But let vs now returne to them whiche remayned in <hi>Vraba.</hi> After the dismissyng of <hi>Valdiuia,</hi> beyng pricked for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde with outragious hunger, they determined to searche the inner partes of that gulfe in sundry places. The extreeme angle or poynt of the same gulfe is distant from the enterance thereof, about fourescore myles. This angle or corner, the Spaniardes call <hi>Culata. Vaschus</hi> hym selfe came to this poynt with a hundred men, coasting along by the gulfe with one brygandine and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne of the boates of those regions, whiche the Urabians call <hi>Vru,</hi> lyke vnto them whiche thinhabitauntes of <hi>Hispaniola</hi> call <hi>Canoas.</hi> From this poynt, there falleth aryuer from the East in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the gulfe, ten times bigger then the ryuer of <hi>Dariena,</hi> which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
<pb facs="tcp:22913:84"/>
so falleth into the same. Saylyng along by the ryuer about the space of thyrtie myles (for they cal it niene leagues) and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what enclynyng towarde the ryght hande Southwarde, they founde certayne vyllages of thinhabitauntes, the kyng whereof was called <hi>Dabaiba.</hi> Our men also were certified before, that <hi>Cemacchus</hi> the kyng of <hi>Dariena,</hi> whom they put to flyght in the battayle, fledde to this <hi>Dabaiba,</hi> but at the commyng of our men, <hi>Dabaiba</hi> also fledde. It is thought that he was admonyshed by <hi>Cemacchus,</hi> that he shoulde not abyde the brunte of our men. He folowed his counsayle, forsooke his villages, and left all thynges desolate: yet our men founde heapes of bowes and arrowes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so muche housholde stuffe, and many fyshyng boates. But those maryshe groundes were neyther apt for sowyng of seedes, or plantyng of trees,<note place="margin">Maryshe grounde.</note> by reason whereof, they founde there fewe suche thynges as they desyred, that is, plentie of vyttualles: for the inhabitauntes of this region haue no bread, but such as they geat in other countreys neare about them by exchange for their fyshe, onlye to serue theyr owne necessitie: yet founde they in the houses of those whiche fledde, golde wrought and grauen, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mountyng to the summe of seuen thousande of those peeces, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che we sayde to be called <hi>Castellani:</hi> also certaine Canoas, of the whiche they brought away two with them, and great plentie of theyr houshold stuffe, with certaine bundels of bowes &amp; arrowes. They say, that from the maryshes of that riuer, there come cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne battes in the nyght season, as bygge as turtle doues, inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng men, and bytyng them with a deadly wounde, as some of them testifie whiche haue ben bytten of the same. I mee selfe communing with <hi>Ancisus</hi> the Lieuetenant whom they reiected, and among other thynges askyng hym of the venemous byting of these battes,<note place="margin">Ancisus bitten of a Batte.</note> he tolde me that he hym selfe was bytten by one of them on the heele, his foote lying vncouered in the nyght, by reason of the heate in sommer season, but that it hurte hym no more, then if he had ben bitten by any other beast not venemous. Other say, that the byting of some of them is venemous: yet that the same is healed incontinently, yf it be washed with water of the sea. <hi>Ancisus</hi> tolde me also, that the venemous woundes made by the Canibales arrowes infected with poyson, are hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by washing with water of the sea, and also by cauterisyng
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:22913:84"/>
with whot irons, and that he had experience thereof in the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Caribana,</hi> where many of his men were so wounded. They departed therefore from the poynt of the gulfe of <hi>Vraba,</hi> not wel contented, because they were not saden with victualles. In this theyr returne, there arose so great a tempest in that wyde gulfe, that they were enforced to cast into the sea al the houshold stuffe,<note place="margin">A tempest.</note> whiche they tooke from the poore wretches whiche liued only by fyshyng. The sea also swalowed vp the two boates that they tooke from them, wherewith the men were lykewyse drowned. The same tyme that <hi>Vaschus Nunnez</hi> attempted to searche the poynt of the gulfe towarde the south, euen then by agreement, dyd <hi>Rodericus Colmenaris</hi> take his voyage toward y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mountaines by the east, with threescore men, by the riuer of the other gulfe. About fourtie myles distant from the mouth of the other ryuer, (for they cal it twelue leagues) he founde certayne vyllages situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate vpon the bankes of the ryuer, whose <hi>Chiui</hi> (that is) kyng, they cal <hi>Turui.</hi> With this kyng dyd <hi>Colmenaris</hi> yet remayne, when <hi>Vaschus</hi> after his returne to <hi>Dariena,</hi> saylyng by the same ryuer, came to hym. Here refreshyng theyr whole companye with the vittuals of this <hi>Turui,</hi> they departed from thence togeather.<note place="margin">King Turui.</note> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fourtie myles from hence, the ryuer encompasseth an Iland inhabited with fyshermen. In this, because they sawe great plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of trees whiche beare <hi>Cassia fistula,</hi> they named the Ilande <hi>Cannafistula.</hi> They found in it .lx. villages of ten cotages apeece.<note place="margin">The Ilande of Cannafistula.</note> On the ryght syde of the Ilande there runneth another riuer, whose chanel is of deapth sufficient to beare Brigandines. This riuer they called <hi>Riuum Nigrum,</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the mouth wherof, about .xv miles distant, they found a towne of fiue .C. houses seuered, whose <hi>Chebi</hi> (that is) kyng, was called <hi>Abenamachei.</hi> They al forsooke theyr houses, as soone as they heard of our mens commyng: but when they saw that our men pursued them, they turned againe, &amp; ran vpon them with desperate mindes, as men driuen from their owne possessions. Theyr weapons are swoords of wood, &amp; long staues lyke iauelins, hardened at the ende with fyre: but they vse neyther bowes nor arrowes, nor any other of the inhabitauntes of the West syde of the gulfe. The poore naked wretches were easyly dryuen to flyght with our weapons. As our men fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them in the chase, they tooke the kyng <hi>Abenamachei,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:22913:85"/>
certaine of his noble men. A common souldier of ours, whom the kyng had wounded, commyng to hym when he was taken, cut of his arme at one stroke with his swoorde: but this was done vnawares to the captaynes. The number of the Christian men whiche were here, was about an hundred and fyftie: the one halfe whereof the captaynes left here, and they with the resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due rowed vp the riuer agayne, with twelue of the boates of those regions, whiche they cal <hi>Vru,</hi> as they of <hi>Hispaniola</hi> cal them <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noas</hi> as we haue sayde. From the ryuer of <hi>Riuus Niger,</hi> and the Ilande of <hi>Cannafistula,</hi> for the space of threescore and ten myles, leauyng both on the right hande and on the left, many riuers fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into it bygger then it selfe, they entred into one, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductyng of one of the naked inhabitauntes, beyng appoynted a guyde for that purpose. Uppon the banke of this ryuer next vnto the mouth of the same, there was a kyng called <hi>Abibeiba,</hi> who because the region was ful of maryshes, had his pallace buylded in the toppe of a hygh tree,<note place="margin">King Abibeiba dwelleth in a tree.</note> a new kind of buildyng, and seldome seene: but that lande bryngeth forth trees of such excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding height, that among theyr branches a man may frame large houses: as we reade the lyke in diuers auctours, howe in many regions where the Ocean sea riseth and ouerfloweth the lande, the people were accustomed to flee to the hygh trees,<note place="margin">The rysyng of the Ocean sea.</note> and after the fall of the water, to take the fyshe left on the lande. This ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of buyldyng, is to lay beames crosse ouer the branches of the trees, fast bounde togeather, and thereupon to rayse theyr frame, strongly made agaynst wynde and weather. Our men suppose that they builde theyr houses in trees, by reason of the great floods and ouerflowyng of riuers, whiche oftentymes chaunce in those regions. These trees are of suche heyght, that the strength of no mans arme,<note place="margin">Trees of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueilous height.</note> is able to hurle a stone to the houses buylded therein. And therfore do I geue the better credit to Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,<note place="margin">Plinie.</note> and other auctours, whiche write that the trees in some pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in <hi>India</hi> are so high by reason of the fruitefulnes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground, abundance of water, and heate of the region, that no man is able to shoote ouer them with an arrowe: and by iudgement of all men,<note place="margin">Fruitefull grounde.</note> it is thought that there is no fruitefuller grounde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the sunne, then this is whereof we nowe entreate. Our men measuryng manye of these trees, founde them to be of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:22913:85"/>
suche bignes, that seuen men, yea sometimes eight, holdyng hande in hande with theyr armes stretched foorth, were scarsely able to fathame them about: yet haue they theyr cellers in the grounde, well replenyshed with such wynes wherof we haue spoken before. For albeit that the vehemencie of the winde is not of power to cast downe those houses, or to breake the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the trees, yet are they tossed therewith, and swaye som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what from syde to syde, by reason whereof, the wyne shoulde be muche troubled with moouing. All other necessarye thinges, they haue with them in the trees. When the kyng or any other of the noble men, dyne or suppe in these trees, theyr wyues are brought them from the cellers by theyr seruauntes, whiche by meanes of exercise, are accustomed with no lesse celerytie to runne vp and downe the staires adherente to the tree, then doo our wayting boyes vppon the playne grounde fetche vs what wee call for from the cobbarde besyde our dyning table. Our men therefore came to the tree of kyng <hi>Abibeiba,</hi> and by thinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretoures called hym foorth to communication, geuing hym signes of peace, and thereuppon wylling hym to come downe. But he denyed that he woulde come out of his house, desy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them to suffer hym to lyue after his fashion: but our men fell from fayre woordes to threatning, that except he woulde des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cende with all his familie, they woulde eyther ouerthrowe the tree, or elles set it on fyre. When he had denied them agayne,<note place="margin">Abibeiba, the kyng of the tree, yeeldeth to Vaschus.</note> they fell to hewing the tree with theyr axes. <hi>Abibeiba</hi> seeing the chippes fall from the tree on euery syde, chaunged his purpose, and came downe with only two of his sonnes. Thus after they had entreated of peace, they communed of geatheryng of golde. <hi>Abibeiba</hi> aunsweared that he had no golde, and that he neuer had any neede therof, nor yet regarded it any more then stones.<note place="margin">Golde no more esteemed then stones.</note> But when they were instante vppon hym, he sayde vnto them, If you so greatly desyre golde, I wyll seeke for some in the next mountaynes, and bryng it vnto you: for it is plentifully engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in those mountaynes. Then he appoynted a daye when he woulde bring this golde. But <hi>Abebeiba</hi> came neyther at the day, nor after the day appointed. They departed therfore from thence well refreshed with his vittuals and wyne, but not with golde as they hoped: yet were they enfourmed the like by <hi>Abibeiba</hi> and

in bygnesse, and some as lytle as sparowes. But of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie of popyngayes, we haue spoken sufficiently in the fyrste Decade: for in the rase of this large lande, <hi>Colonus</hi> hym selfe brought and sent to the courte a great number of euery kynde, the whiche it was lawfull for all the people to beholde, and are yet dayly brought in like manner. There remayneth yet one thyng moste woorthy to be put in hystorie,<note place="margin">A philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal discourse as concerning thoriginal of springes and ryuers.</note> the whiche, I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to haue chaunced into the handes of <hi>Cicero</hi> or <hi>Liuie,</hi> then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to myne: for the thyng is so marueylous in my estimation, that I fynde my wytte more entangled in the discription hereof, then is sayde of the henne when she seeth her young chycken inwrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in towe or flaxe.<note place="margin">The breadth of the lande at Vraba, from the North O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean to the South sea.</note> The breadth of that lande from the North Ocean to the south sea, is only sixe dayes iourney, by relation of the inhabitauntes. The multitude therfore and greatnesse of the riuers on the one syde, and on the other syde the narownesse of the lande, bryng me into suche doubt howe it can come to passe, that in so lytle a space of three dayes iourney, measuryng from the high toppes of those mountaynes, I doo not vnderstande howe so many and so great ryuers may haue recourse vnto this North sea: for it is to be thought, that as many do flow toward thinhabitants of the south. These riuers of <hi>Vraba</hi> are but small, in comparison of many other in those coastes: for the Spany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes say, that in the tyme of <hi>Colonus,</hi> they found and passed by an other riuer after this, whose gulfe fallyng into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sea, they affirme to be litle lesse then a hundred myles in the fyrst coastes of <hi>Paria,</hi> as we haue sayde elsewhere: for they say, that it falleth from the toppes of high mountaynes with so swyft and furious a course, that by the violence and greatnesse thereof, it dryueth backe the sea, although it be rough &amp; enforced with a contrary wynd. They al affirme lykewyse, that in al the large tracte therof, they felt no sowre or salt water, but that all the water was freeshe, sweete, and apt to be drunke. Thinhabitauntes call this ryuer <hi>Marag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonum,</hi> and the regions adiacent to the same, <hi>Mariatambal, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mamorus,</hi> and <hi>Paricora:</hi> besyde those riuers whiche I haue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med before, as <hi>Darien<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Grandis, Dabaiba, Beragua, Sancti Mathei, Boius gatti, Delagartos,</hi> &amp; <hi>Gaira,</hi> they which of late haue searched those coastes, haue founde many other. Deliberatyng there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with me selfe, from whence these mountaynes, beyng so
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:22913:100"/>
narowe and neare vnto the sea on both sydes, haue suche great holowe caues or dennes of such capacitie, and from whence they are fylled, to cast foorth suche abundance of water: hereof also as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng them the opinions of the inhabitauntes, they affirme them to be of diuers iudgementes herein, alleaging fyrst the greatnes of the mountaynes to be the cause, whiche they say to be verye high, whiche thyng also <hi>Colonus</hi> the first fynder thereof affirmeth to be true, addyng thereunto that the paradise of pleasure is in the tops of those mountaynes whiche appeare from the gulfe of <hi>Paria</hi> &amp; <hi>Os Draconis,</hi> as he is fully perswaded. They agree there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that there are great caues within these mountaynes, but it resteth to consyder from whence they are fylled. If therfore al the riuers of freshe waters, by the opinion of many, do so flowe out of the sea,<note place="margin">The sea.</note> as dryuen and compelled through the passages or pores of the earth, by the ponderous weyght of the sea it selfe, as we see them breake foorth of the sprynges, and directe theyr course to the sea agayne, then the thyng is lesse to be maruey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at here, then in other places: for we haue not read that in any other place, two suche seas haue enuironed any lande with so narowe lymyttes:<note place="margin">The lande en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed with two seas.</note> for it hath on the ryght syde the great Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, where the sunne goeth downe on the left hande, and another on the other syde where the sunne ryseth, nothyng inferiour to the fyrste in greatnesse, for they suppose it to be myxte and ioyned as al one with the sea of East India. This lande therfore beyng burdened with so great a weyght on the one syde, &amp; on the other, (yf this opinion be of any value) is enforced to swalowe vp such deuoured waters, and agayne to cast foorth the same in open springes and streames. But yf we shall denye that the earth draweth humours of the sea, and agree that all fountaynes or sprynges are engendred of the conuersion or turnyng of ayre into water,<note place="margin">Conuersion of ayre into wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues of moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes.</note> distilling within the holow places of the mountaines (as the most part thinke) we wyll geue place rather to thauctho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of them whiche stycke to those reasons, then that our sense is satisfied of the ful trueth thereof. Yet do I not repugne, that in some caues of mountaynes, water is turned into ayre: for I mee selfe haue seene, howe in the caues of manye mountaynes in Spayne, in manner showres of rayne do fall continuallye, and that the water geathered by this meanes, doth sende foorth
<pb facs="tcp:22913:101"/>
certayne riuers by the sydes of the mountaynes, wherewith all suche trees as are planted on the steepe or foote of the mountay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, as vines, oliue trees, and suche other, are watered, and this especially in one place: as the right honorable Lodouike the Cardinal of Aragonie, most obsequious to your holynesse, and two other bishops of Italy, whereof the one is <hi>Siluius Pandonus,</hi> and the other an Archbishop (whose name and title I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member) can beare me witnesse: for when we were togeather at <hi>Granata,</hi> lately deliuered from the dominion of the Moores, and walked for our pastyme to certaine pleasant hilles (by the whiche there ranne a fayre ryuer)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> while Cardinal Lodouike occupied hym selfe in shootyng at byrdes whiche were in the bushes neere vnto the ryuer, I &amp; thother two bishops determined to clime the mountaynes, to searche the original and spryng of the ryuer: for we were not farre from the toppes thereof. Folowyng therfore the course of the ryuer, we founde a great caue, in which was a continual fal of water, as it had ben a showre of rayne, the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whereof, fallyng into a trenche made with mans hande, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth to a ryuer, and runneth downe by the sydes of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes. The lyke is also seene in this famous towne of <hi>Vallado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leto</hi> (where we nowe soiourne) in a certaine greene close, not past a furlong distant from the walles of the towne. I graunt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that in certayne places, by conuersion of the ayrie deawe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to water, within the caues of suche mountaynes, many springes and riuers are engendred: but I suppose that nature was not sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitate to bryng foorth suche great floods by this so small indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strie. Two reasons therfore do sounde best to my iudgement: wherof the one is,<note place="margin">
                           <p>The often fal of rayne and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall spryng tyme.</p>
                           <p>The Equinoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall.</p>
                        </note> the often fal of rayne: the other, the continual autume or spryng tyme which is in those regions, being so neere vnto the Equinoctial, that the common people can perceiue no difference betweene the length of the day and the nyght through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the yeere, where as these two seasons are more apt to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender abundance of rayne, then eyther extreme wynter, or fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent sommer. An other reason in effect much like vnto the fyrst, is this: If the sea be ful of pores, and that by the pores thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing opened by the south wyndes,<note place="margin">The pores of the sea, and the south wynde.</note> we shal consent that vapours are lyfted vp, whereof the watery cloudes are engendred, this lande must needes be moysted with moe showres then anye o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:22913:101"/>
yf it be as narowe as they say, and enuironed with two mayne seas collaterally beatyng on the same: howsoeuer it be, I can not but geue credite to the report of suche worthy men as haue recourse to those regions, and can no lesse then declare the same, albeit it may seeme incredible to some ignorant persons, not knowing the power of nature, to whom, Plinie was perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that nothing was impossible. We haue therefore thought it good to make this discourse by the way of argument, lest on the one syde, men of good learnyng and iudgement, and on the other syde, suche as are studious to finde occasions of quarel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng in other mens wrytynges, shoulde iudge vs to be so vndis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete, lightly to geue credite to euery tale, not being consonant to reason: but of the force and great violence of those freshe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, whiche repulsyng the sea, make so great a gulfe (as we haue sayde) I thynke the cause thereof to be the great multitude of floods and riuers, whiche beyng geathered togeather, make so great a poole, and not one ryuer, as they suppose. And foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the mountaines are exceeding high and steepe, I thinke the violence of the fall of the waters to be of suche force, that this conflict betweene the waters, is caused by thimpulsion of the poole, that the salt water can not enter into the gulfe. But here perhaps some wyll marueyle at me, why I should marueyle so muche hereat, speakyng vnto me scornefully, after this manner: Why doth he so marueyle at the great riuers of those regions? Hath not Italie his <hi>Eridanus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The fludde Eridanus.</note> named the kyng of ryuers of the old wryters? Haue not other regions also the lyke? as we reade of <hi>Tanais, Ganges,</hi> and <hi>Danubius,</hi> which are sayde so to ouercome the sea, that freshe water may be drawen fourtie myles within the same. These men I would satisfie with this aunswere. The famous ryuer of <hi>Padus</hi> in Italie (whiche they nowe call <hi>Po,</hi> and was of the Greekes called <hi>Eridanus</hi>) hath the great moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes called <hi>Alpes,</hi> diuiding Fraunce, Germanie, and Panno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, from Italie, lying at the backe therof, as it were bulwarkes agger, full of moysture, and with a long tracte receiuyng <hi>Tici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam,</hi> with innumerable other great ryuers, falleth into the sea Adriatike. The lyke is also to be vnderstoode of the other. But these ryuers (as our men were enfourmed by the kynges) fall into the Ocean sea with larger and fuller channels neere hande,
<pb facs="tcp:22913:102"/>
and some there are whiche affirme this lande to be very large in other places, although it be but narowe here. There commeth also to my remembraunce another cause, the whiche although it be of no great force, yet do I entende to wryte it. Perhaps therefore the length of the lande reachyng farre from the East to the West, if it be narowe, may be a helpe hereunto: for as we reade,<note place="margin">The ryuer Alpheus.</note> that the ryuer <hi>Alpheus</hi> passeth through the holowe places vnder the sea, from the citie of <hi>Elis</hi> in <hi>Peloponeso,</hi> and breaketh forth at the fountayne or spryng <hi>Arethusa</hi> in the Iland of <hi>Sicillia,</hi> so is it possible that these mountaines may haue such long caues parteynyng vnto them,<note place="margin">Longe caues in the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines.</note> that they may be the receptacles of the water passing through the landes beyng farre distant, and that the same waters commyng by so long a tracte, may in the way be greatly encreased, by the conuersion of ayre into water, as we haue sayde. Thus much haue I spoken freely, permitting both to them which do frendly interprete other mens dooyngs, and also to the malitious scorners, to take the thing euen as them lysteth, for hytherto I can make no further declaration hereof, but when the trueth shalbe better knowen, I wil do my diligence to commit the same to wrytyng. Nowe therfore, forasmuch as we haue spoken thus muche of the breadth of this lande, we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende to describe the length and fourme of the same.</p>

thinges in the Latine tongue, I did my endeuour that al things myght come foorth with due tryal and experience: whereupon I repayred to the Bishop of <hi>Burges,</hi> beyng the cheefe refuge of this nauigation. As we were therfore secretely togeather in one chamber, we had many instruments parteining to these affaires, as globes,<note place="margin">Cardes of the sea.</note> and many of those maps whiche are commonly called the shipmans cardes, or cardes of the sea. Of the which, one was drawen by the Portugales,<note place="margin">The carde of Americus Vesputius.</note> wherunto <hi>Americus Vesputius</hi> is said to haue put to his hande, beyng a man most expert in this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie, and a Florentine borne, who also vnder the stipende of the Portugales, had sayled towarde the South pole many degrees beyonde the Equinoctiall. In this carde we founde the first front of this lande to be broder then the kynges of <hi>Vraba</hi> had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded our men of theyr mountaynes. To another, <hi>Colonus</hi> the Admiral, while he yet lyued, and searched those places,<note place="margin">The carde of Colouns.</note> had ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the beginning with his owne handes: whereunto <hi>Bartholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meus Colonus</hi> his brother and Lieuetenaunt had added his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for he also had sayled about those coastes. Of the Spany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes lykewyse, as many as thought them selues to haue anye knowledge what parteyned to measure the land &amp; the sea, drewe certayne cardes in parchment as concernyng these nauigations.

From <hi>Os Draconis,</hi> to the cape or poynt of <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chibacoa,</hi> whiche being passed, there is a gulfe on the left hande, we measured three hundred leagues in one Carde, &amp; much there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about in another.

with the other, yet may we geather by a diameter or right lyne, about three hundred leagues. Hereby may you geather what is the length of this lande, but of the breadth, perhaps we shal here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after haue further knowledge. Let vs nowe speake somewhat of the varietie of the degrees of the eleuation of the pole starres. This lande therefore,<note place="margin">The eleuation of the pole.</note> although it reache foorth from the East into the West, yet is it crooked, and hath the poynt bendyng so towarde the South, that it looseth the syght of the North pole, and is extended beyonde the Equinoctial lyne seuen degrees to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde the South pole: but the poynt hereof, parteyneth to the iurisdiction of the Portugales, as we haue sayde.<note place="margin">The iurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Portugales,</note> Leauing this poynt, and saylyng towarde <hi>Paria,</hi> the North starre is seene againe, &amp; is so much the more lifted vp, in how much the region enclineth more towarde the West.

But I thought it not good to let passe what chaunced to these miserable men among theyr generall calamities. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that when I was a chylde, me thought my bowelles grated, and that my spirites were marueylously troubled for very pitie, when I read in the poete Uirgyl, howe <hi>Achemenides</hi> was left of <hi>Vlysses</hi> vpon the sea bankes among y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> giantes called <hi>Cyclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes,</hi> where for the space of many dayes from the departyng of <hi>Vlysses,</hi> vntyl the comming of <hi>Eneas,</hi> he eate none other meate, but only berries and hawes.<note place="margin">Extreme hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</note> But our vnfortunate Spanyards, whiche folowed <hi>Nicuesa</hi> to inhabite <hi>Beragua,</hi> would haue estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med hawes &amp; berries for great delicates.

Shortly after, by the conduct of <hi>Chiapes</hi> hym selfe, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne of his men departyng from the toppes of the mountaynes, he came in the space of foure dayes to the bankes of the newe sea: where assemblyng al his men togeather, with the kynges scribes and notaries, they addicted all that mayne sea with all the landes adiacent thereunto, to the dominion and Empire of Castile. Here he left part of his souldiers with <hi>Chiapes,</hi> that he myght the easelier search those coastes.

The pearles of these, which are founde on the sande, are but lytle, the fyshe it selfe, is more pleasaunt in eatyng, then are our oysters, as our men report: But perhaps hunger, the sweete sause of all meates, caused our men so to thynke.

As he spake these woordes, he lyfted vp his handes and eyes towarde the Sonne, whom they honour as God. Then he spake further to <hi>Vaschus,</hi> saying, In that you haue destroyed and slayne our violent and proude enemies, you haue brought peace and quietnesse to vs and our familyes, and bounde vs for euer to loue and obey you.

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:22913:117"/>
many of <hi>Comogrus</hi> familiars had ben captyue, but our men now perceyued that they measured his power by theyr owne: For theyr kynges are but gnattes (compared to Elephantes) in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to the power &amp; policie of our men. Our men were also en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmed by such as dwelt neare about <hi>Tumanama,</hi> that his regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was not beyond the mountaynes as they supposed, nor yet so ryche in golde as young <hi>Comogrus</hi> had declared: Yet consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted they of his subduing, whiche they thought they myght the easeliar bryng to passe, because <hi>Pocchorrosa</hi> was his mortal ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, who most gladly promised them his aduice and ayde here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. <hi>Vaschus</hi> therfore, leauyng his sicke men in the vyllage of <hi>Pocchorrosa,</hi> tooke with hym threescore of his most valyant soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and declared vnto them, howe kyng <hi>Tumanama</hi> had often tymes spoken proude and threatnyng wordes agaynst them:<note place="margin">A good po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie.</note> Lykewyse that it nowe stood them in hand of necessitie to passe through his dominion, and that he thought it best to set vpon hym vnwares. The souldiers consented to his aduice, and exhorted hym to geue the aduenture, promising that they woulde folow hym, whyther soeuer he went. They determined therfore to goe two dayes iourney in one day, that <hi>Tumanama,</hi> not kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyng of theyr sodayne commyng, myght haue no leysure to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble an army: and the thyng came to passe euen as they had deuised. For in the first watche of the nyght, our men, with the <hi>Pocchorrosians,</hi> inuaded the village and pallace of <hi>Tumanama,</hi> where they tooke hym prysoner, suspectyng nothyng lesse. He had with hym two young men, whiche he abused vnnaturally, also fourescore women, whiche he had taken violently from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers kynges: lykewyse, a great number of his gentlemen &amp; subiectes were taken straglyng in other vyllages neere about his pallace. For theyr houses are not adherent togeather as ours be, because they are oftentymes troubled with vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whirlewyndes, by reason of the sodayne chaunges and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ayer, caused by the influence of the planettes,<note place="margin">The cause of vehement windes neere the Equinoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall.</note> in the equalitie of the day and nyght, beyng there in maner both of one length throughout all the yeere, forasmuch as they are neere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Equinoctiall line, as we haue sayde before. Theyr hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses are made of trees, couered, and after theyr maner thatched with the stalkes of certayne rough hearbes. To the pallace
<pb facs="tcp:22913:118"/>
of <hi>Tumanama,</hi> was only one house adherent, and that euen as bygge as the pallace it selfe. Eyther of these houses were in length a hundred and twentye paces, and in breadth fiftie paces, as our men measured them. In these two houses the kyng was accustomed to muster his men, as often as he prepared an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. When <hi>Tumanama</hi> therfore was thus taken captiue, with all his Sardanapanicall familie, the <hi>Pocchorrosians</hi> bragged and threatened hym, beyng now bound, that he shoulde shortly be hanged: the other kynges also his borderers, reioyced at his mysfortune. Whereby our men parceyued that <hi>Tumanama</hi> was no lesse troublesome to his neyghbours, then was <hi>Pacra</hi> to the kynges of the south syde of the mountaynes. <hi>Vaschus</hi> also the better to please them, threatened hym greeuouslye, but in deede entended no euyll towards hym.<note place="margin">Vaschus his Wordes to King Tuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nama.</note> He spake therfore sharply vnto hym with these woords: Thou shalt now suffer punishment thou cruell tyrant, for thy pryde and abhominations.

And heerewith commaunded hym to be taken vp: Neuerthelesse geuyng a pryuie token of pardon to them whiche layde handes on hym. Thus vnhappy <hi>Tumanama,</hi> fearyng and beleeuyng that <hi>Vaschus</hi> had ment in ernest as he commaunded, fell pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate at his feete, and with teares desired pardon: Protesting that he neuer spake any suche wordes, but that perhaps his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men in theyr drunkennesse had so abused theyr tongues, whiche he coulde not rule: For theyr wynes, although they be not made of grapes, yet are they of force to make men drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. He declared furthermore, that the other kynges his bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers had of malice surmised such lyes of hym, enuying his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, because he was of greater power then they, most humbly desyryng <hi>Vaschus,</hi>

Thus laying his ryght hande on his breast,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:22913:118"/>
he swore by the Sonne, that he euer loued and feared the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians sence he fyrst hearde of theyr fame and victoryes: espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyally when he harde say, that they had <hi>Michanas,</hi> that is, swor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des sharper then theyrs, and suche as cutte in peeces all thinges that come in theyr wayes. Then directyng his eyes towarde <hi>Vaschus,</hi> who had his sworde in his hand, he spake thus, Who (except he were out of his witte) dare lyft vp his hande agaynst this sworde of yours, wherewith you are able with one strooke to cleaue a man from the head to the nauell? Let no man therfore perswade you (O most myghtye victourer) that euer such wordes proceeded out of my mouth. As <hi>Tumanama</hi> with tremblyng spake these wordes, therwith swalowyng downe the knot of death, <hi>Vaschus</hi> seemed by his teares to be moued to compassion, and speakyng to hym with chearfull countenance, commaunded hym to be loosed. This doone, he sent immediatly to his pallace for thyrtye poundes weyght of pure golde, artificyally wrought into sundry ouches,<note place="margin">Xxx. pounde weight of wrought gold.</note> whiche his wyues and concubines vsed to weare.

of <hi>Tumanama,</hi> where (as he sayth) he perceyued by the coloure of the earth, that it was lyke to bryng foorth golde.

Whereby they argued, that the rychenesse of that land was agreeable to the report of the borderers, although <hi>Vaschus</hi> coulde by no meanes cause <hi>Tumanama</hi> to confesse the same. They suppose that he nothyng esteemed so small a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but other say, that he denyed his countrey to be fruiteful of golde, least by reason thereof, the desyre of golde myght intyse our men to inhabyte his kyngdome, as in deede the seely kyng was a prophet in so thynkyng. For they chose that and the region of <hi>Pocchorrosa</hi> to inhabite, and determyned to buylde townes in them both, if it should so please the kyng of Castile: aswel that they myght be baytyng places and vittailyng houses for suche as shoulde iourney towarde the south, as also that both the regions were fruiteful, and of good ground to beare fruites and trees. Intendyng nowe therefore to depart from thence, he tryed the earth by chaunce in an other place, where the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the ground, with certayne shynyng stones, seemed to be a token of golde, where causyng a small pyt to be dygged, litle beneath the vpper crust of the earth, he founde so muche golde, as weyghed the peece of golde whiche the Spaniardes call <hi>Castellanum aureum,</hi>

Also some of them whiche were somwhat feeble, and not able to trauayle, although not greeuously sycke, were led by the armes, vntyll they came to the dominion of kyng <hi>Comogrus,</hi> a great frende to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, of whom we haue largely made mention before. At <hi>Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> commyng thyther, he founde that the olde kyng was dead, and his sonne (whom we so praysed for his wysedome) to reigne in his steade, and that he was baptised by the name of Charles. The palace of this <hi>Comogrus,</hi> is situate at the foote of a stiepe hyll well cultured, hauyng toward the south a playne of twelue leagues in breadth, and very fruitefull. This playne they call <hi>Zauana.</hi> Beyond this, are the great and hygh moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes, whiche diuide the two seas, whereof we haue spoken before.

As our men therefore came to these parties, kyng <hi>Comogrus</hi> (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse called Charles by his christian name) met them ioyfully, and entertayned them honorably, geuyng them their fyll of pleasaunt meates and drynkes: He gaue also to <hi>Vaschus</hi> twentie pounde weight of wrought golde. <hi>Vaschus</hi> recompensed hym with thynges whiche he esteemed muche more, as axes, and sundry kyndes of carpenters tooles: also a souldiours cloke, and a fayre shurt, wrought with needle woorke. By these gyftes, <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogrus</hi> thought hym selfe to be halfe a God among his borde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers. <hi>Vaschus</hi> at his departyng from hence, earnestly charged <hi>Comogrus,</hi> and the other kynges, to remayne faythful and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to the christan kyng of Castile, if they desyred to lyue in peace and quietnesse, and that they shoulde heareafter more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently

These af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres thus happely atchiued, he went forward on his voyage to the palaice of kyng <hi>Poncha,</hi> where he found foure young men, which were come from <hi>Dariena,</hi> to certifie hym that there were certayne shyppes come from <hi>Hispaniola</hi> laden with vyttayles, and other necessaries.<note place="margin">Vaschus retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to Dari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ena.</note> Wherfore takyng with hym twentie of his most lusty souldiers, he made hast to <hi>Dariena,</hi> with long ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys: leauyng the residue behynd him, to folowe at theyr leysure. He writeth, that he came to <hi>Dariena</hi> the .xiiii. Ca. of Fe. An. 1514.

He attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no enterprise, or toke in hand any voyage, without thinuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God and his holy sayntes. Thus was <hi>Vaschus Balboa</hi> of a vyolent Goliath, turned into <hi>Heliseus,</hi> and from <hi>Anteus</hi> to <hi>Hercules,</hi> the conquerour of monsters.

Our men had entelligence at the length, that this ruler was a great marchant,<note place="margin">A great marchaunt.</note> which came to the marte from other coastes of the Ilande: for they exercyse bying and sellyng by exchaunge with their confines. He had also with hym good store of suche ware as they stand in neede of, or take pleasure in: as laton belles, rasers, knyues, and hatchettes made of a certayne sharpe yellowe bryght stone, with handles of a strong kinde of wood: also many other necessary instrumentes, with kytchen stuffe, and vesselles for all necessary vses: lykewyse sheetes of gossampine cotton, wrought of sundrie colours.

When they had presentted theyr giftes, they went somwhat backward, and made lowe curtesy after theyr maner, bowyng their heades and bodyes reuerently. He recompensed their gentilnes, rewardyng them with other of our thynges, as counters, braslettes, and garlands of glasse, and counterfet stones, lookyng glasses, needelles, and pynnes, with suche other trashe, whiche seemed vnto them pretious marchandize. In this great tracte, there are two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, whereof the one is called <hi>Tuia,</hi> and the other <hi>Maia.</hi> He writeth,<note place="margin">The regions of Tuia &amp; Maia.</note> that all that lande is very fayre and holsome, by reason of the excellent temperatnesse of the ayre: And that it is inferiour to no land in fruitefull ground, beyng partly full of mountaynes, and partly large playnes: also replenyshed with many goodly trees, holsome hearbes, continuyng greene, and floryshyng al the whole yeere.

Departyng therfore from the large re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of <hi>Quiriquetana,</hi> the .xiii. day of the calendes of September, when he had sayled thyrtie leagues, he found a ryuer, within the mouth wherof he drewe freshe water in the sea:<note place="margin">Freshe water in the sea.</note> where also the shore was so cleane without rockes, that he founde grounde e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery where, where he myght aptly cast anker.

Here was <hi>Nicuesa</hi> lost afterward, when he sought <hi>Beragua,</hi> by reason whereof, they called it <hi>Rio de los perdidos,</hi> that is, the ryuer of the lost men. Thus <hi>Colonus</hi> the Admiral, yet further continuyng his course agaynst the furye of the sea, founde manye hygh mountaynes, and horrible valleys, with dyuers ryuers and hauens, from all the which (as he sayth) proceeded sweete sauours, greatly recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atyng and comfortyng nature: Insomuche that in al this long tract, there was not one of his men diseased, vntyll he came to a region whiche thinhabitantes call <hi>Quicuris,</hi>

allure them to frendshyppe, geue them many of our thynges: But they refused them, suspecting some disceyt thereby, bycause he would not receiue theirs. They wrought all by sygnes:<note place="margin">Ciuile and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane people</note> for one vnderstoode not a woord of the others language. Suche gyftes as were sent them, they left on the shore, and woulde take no part thereof. They are of suche ciuilitie and humanitie, that they esteeme it more honorable to geue, then to take. They sent our men two young women, beyng virgines, of commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable fauour, and goodly stature, sygnifying vnto them, that they myght take them away with them, if it were their pleasure. These women, after the maner of their countrey, were couered from their ancles somwhat aboue their priuye partes, with a certayne cloth made of gossampine cotton, but the men are all naked. The women vse to cut their heare: but the men let it growe on the hynder part of their heades, and cut it on the fore part. Their long heare, they bynde vp with fyllettes, and wynde it in sundry rowles, as our maydes are accustomed to do. The virgines whiche were sent to the Admirall, he decked in fayre apparell, and gaue them many gyftes, and sent them home agayne. But lykewyse all these rewardes and apparel they left vppon the shore, bycause our men had refused their giftes. Yet tooke he two men away with hym (and those very wyllyngly) that by learnyng the Spanyshe tongue, he myght afterward vse them for interpretours. He considered that the tractes of these coastes were not greatly troubled with vehement motions, or ouerflowynges of the sea, forasmuche as trees growe in the sea not farre from the shore, euen as they doo vppon the bankes of ryuers: the whiche thyng also other do affirme, whiche haue latelyer searched those coastes, declaryng that the sea ryseth and falleth but litle therabout.

booke of his natural historie maketh mention of suche trees, describyng them to be on the lande, but not in the sea. The Admiral wryteth also, that the lyke beastes are engendred in the coastes of <hi>Cariai,</hi> as in other prouinces of these regions, and such as we haue spoken of before:<note place="margin">A strange kynd of Monkeys.</note> Yet that there is one founde here in nature muche differyng from the other. This beast is of the bygnesse of a great Monkey, but with a tayle much lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and bygger, it lyueth in the wooddes, and remoueth from tree to tree in this maner: Hangyng by the tayle vppon the braunche of a tree, and geatheryng strength by swaying her body twyse or thryse to and fro, she casteth her selfe from branche to branche, and so from tree to tree, as though she flewe. An ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of ours hurt one of them, who, perceiuyng her selfe to be wounded,<note place="margin">A Monkey fyghteth with a man.</note> leapt downe from the tree, and fiercely set on him whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che gaue her the wound, in so much that he was fayne to defend hym selfe with his swoorde. And thus by chaunce, cuttyng of one of her armes, he tooke her, and with much a do brought her to the shyppes, where within a while she waxed tame. Whyle she was thus kept and bounde with cheynes, certayne other of our hunters had chased a wylde Bore out of the maryshes neere vnto the sea syde: for hunger and desyre of fleshe, caused them to take double pleasure in huntyng. In this meane tyme other which remayned in the shyppes, goyng a lande to recreate them selues, tooke this Monkie with them, who, assoone as she had espyed the Bore, set vp her brystels, and made towarde him. The Bore lykewyse shooke his bristels,<note place="margin">A conflyct be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key and a wyld Bore.</note> and whet his teeth. The Monkie furiously inuaded the Bore, wrappyng her tayle about his body, &amp; with her arme, reserued of her victourer, helde him so fast about the throte, that he was suffocate.

As he went forwarde, about twentie leagues from <hi>Cariai,</hi> he founde a gulfe of suche largenes, that it contayned .xii. leagues in compasse, in the mouth of this gulfe was foure litle Ilandes, so neere togeather, that they made a safe hauen to enter into the gulfe: This gulfe is the hauen whiche we sayde before to be called <hi>Cerabaro</hi> of thinhabitantes. But they haue nowe learned, that only the land of the one syde therof, lying on the ryght hande

At his fyrst arryuyng, he espyed two of thinhabitantes, hauyng cheynes about theyr neckes, made of ouches (whiche they call <hi>Guauines</hi>) of base golde, artificially wrought in the fourmes of Eagles, and Lions, with dyuers other beastes, and foules.

The more instant that our men were to remayne, so much the greater multitude of bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers flocked togeather dayly, disturbyng them both nyght and day, sometymes on the one syde, and sometymes on the other.

But theyr calamitie ceassed not heere: For as fast as theyr shyppes leaked, theyr strength diminished, so that they were no longer able to keepe them from sinkyng.<note place="margin">A miserable case.</note> By reason whereof, fallyng into the handes of the Barbarians, and inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed without hope of departure, they led theyr lyues for the space of tenne monethes among the naked people, more miserablie then euer dyd <hi>Achemenides</hi> among the Giauntes, called <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clopes,</hi> rather lyuyng, then beyng eyther contented or satisfied with the strange meates of that Ilande, and that onely at suche tymes as pleased the Barbarians to geue them part of theyrs. The deadly enmitie and malice whiche these barbarous kynges beare one agaynst an other, made greatly with our men: For at suche tymes as they attempted warre agaynst theyr borderers, they woulde sometymes geue our men part of theyr bread, to ayde them. But how miserable and wretched a thyng it is to liue onely with bread gotten by beggyng, your holynesse may easly coniecture: especially where al other accustomed foode is lack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng, as wyne, oyle, fleshe, butter, cheese, and mylke, wherwith the stomackes of our people of Europe haue euer been norish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, euen from theyr cradels.<note place="margin">Necessitie hath no lawe.</note> Therfore as necessitie is subiect to no law: so doth it enforce men to attempt desperate aduentures, and those y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sooner, which by a certayne nobilitie of nature, do no further esteeme lyfe then it is ioyned with some felicitie.<note place="margin">Howe farre life is to be estemed</note>

                        <note place="margin">Tirrhenum is nowe called Tuscane.</note> from the sea Adriatike, whiche is nowe commonly called the gulfe of Uenice.

These mountaynes were in some place smooth, pleasaunt, and fruitfull, full of goodly trees and hearbes, and somwhere hygh, rough, ful of rockes, and barren, as chaunceth in the famous mountayne of <hi>Taurus</hi> in <hi>Asia,</hi> and also in dyuers coastes of our mountaynes of <hi>Apennini,</hi> &amp; such other of like bygnesse. The rydgies also of these mountaynes are diuided with goodly and fayre valleys. That part of the mountaynes which includeth the limittes of <hi>Beragua,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tayns of Beragua higher then the cloudes.</note> is thought to be hygher then the cloudes, insomuch that (as they say) the tops of them can seldome be seene for the multitude of thicke cloudes whiche are beneath the same. <hi>Colanus</hi> the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, the fyrst fynder of these regions, affirmeth that the toppes of the mountaines of <hi>Beragua,</hi> are more then fiftie myles in heyght.<note place="margin">Mountaynes of fiftie myles heyght.</note> He sayth furthermore, that in the same region at the rootes of the mountaynes the way is open to the south sea, &amp; compareth it as it were betwene Uenice and <hi>Genua,</hi> or <hi>Ianua,</hi> as the Genues wyl haue it called, whiche fable that theyr citie was builded of <hi>Ianus.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ianus other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wase called Iaphet the son of Noe.</note> He affirmeth also, that this land reacheth forth toward the south, and that from hence it taketh the begynning of breadth: lyke as from the Alpes, out of the narowe thygh of Italie, we see the large and mayne landes of Fraunce, Germanie, and Pannonie, to the Sarmatians and Scithians, euen vnto the mountaynes and rockes of Riphea, and the frosen sea, and embrase therewith, as with a continuall bonde, al Thracia, and Grecia, with all that is included within the promontorie or poynt of <hi>Malea,</hi> and <hi>Hellespontus</hi> southwarde, and the sea <hi>Euzinus,</hi> and the marys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes of <hi>Meotis</hi> in <hi>Scithia</hi> northwarde.

It shall suffice to haue sayde thus muche of the length hereof: Let vs nowe therefore speake somwhat of the breadth of the same. We haue made mention before howe the south sea is diuided by narowe limittes from our Ocean, as it was proued by thexperience of <hi>Vaschus Nunnez</hi> and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, which fyrst made open the way thyther. But as dyuers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the mountaynes of our Alpes in Europe are somwhere na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe, and in some place brode: euen so, by the lyke prouidence of nature, this land in some part therof reacheth farre in breadth, and is in other places coarcted with narowe limittes from sea to sea, with valleys also in some places, whereby men may passe from the one syde to the other. Where we haue described the regions of <hi>Vraba</hi> and <hi>Beragua</hi> to be situate, these seas are diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by small distaunce: Yet ought we to thynke the region, whiche the great ryuer of <hi>Maragnonus</hi> runneth through,<note place="margin">The great riuer Maragnonus.</note> to be very large, if we shall graunt <hi>Maragnonum</hi> to be a ryuer, and no sea, as the freshe waters of the same ought to perswade vs. For in suche narowe caues of the earth, there can be no swalowyng gulfes of suche bygnesse as to receiue or nooryshe so great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of water. The lyke is also to be supposed of the great ryuer of <hi>Dabaiba,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The great riuer Dabaiba, or sancti Iohan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</note> whiche we sayde to be from the corner of the gulfe of <hi>Vraba,</hi> in some place of fourtie fathomes depth, and som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where fiftie: also three myles in breadth, and so to fall into the sea.

This superstition hath been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded them by a craftie kynde of men, vnder pretence of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to thintent that they myght enioy suche gyftes and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringes as were brought to the place where she was honoured. This is sufficient for this purpose. They say furthermore, that the maryshes of the narowe land, whereof we haue spoken, bring forth great plentie of Crocodiles, Dragons, Battes, and Gnats,<note place="margin">Dragons and Crocodiles in the maryshes.</note> beyng very hurtfull. Therefore whensoeuer they take any iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney towarde the south, they go out of the way toward the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes, and eschewe the regions neere vnto those perylous fennes or maryshes. Some thynke that there is a valley lying that way that the ryuer runneth, which our men cal <hi>Rio de los perdidos,</hi> that is, the ryuer of the lost men (so named by the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune whiche there befell to <hi>Nicuesa</hi> and his company) and not farre distant from the hauen <hi>Cerabaro,</hi> whiche diuideth those mountaines toward the south.<note place="margin">The hauen Cerabaro.</note> But let vs now finishe this booke with a fewe other thinges woorthy to be noted.

that on the ryght hand and left hande from <hi>Dariena</hi> there are twentye ryuers,<note place="margin">Twentie gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ryuers.</note> in all the whiche great plentye of gold is found. Beyng demaunded what was the cause why they brought no greater aboundance of golde from thence: they answeared, that they lacked miners, and that the men whiche they tooke with them from Spayne thyther, were not accustomed to labour, but for the most part brought vp in the warres. This land seemeth also to promise many precious stones:<note place="margin">Precious stones.</note> For besyde those which I sayde to be founde neere vnto <hi>Cariai</hi> and <hi>Sancta Martha,</hi> one <hi>Andreas Moralis,</hi> a pilot (who had trauayled those coastes with <hi>Iohannes de la Cossa</hi> whyle he yet lyued) had a precious Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monde,<note place="margin">A precious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amond of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding bignes.</note> whiche he bought of a naked young man in the region of <hi>Cumana,</hi> in the prouince of <hi>Paria.</hi> This stone was as long as two ioyntes of a mans myddle fynger, and as byg as the fyrst ioynt of the thumbe, beyng also paynted on euery syde, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of eyght squares, perfectly fourmed by nature. They say that with this they made scarres in anuylles and hammers, and brake the teeth of fyles, the stone remayning vnperyshed. The young man of <hi>Cumana,</hi> wore this stone about his necke among other ouches, &amp; solde it to <hi>Andreas Moralis</hi> for fyue of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfect stones, made of glasse, of diuers colours, wherewith the ignorant young man was greatly delyted: They found also cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne Topases on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> shore.<note place="margin">Topasis.</note> But the estimation of gold was so farre entred into the heades of our men, that they had no regarde to stones. Also the most part of the Spanyardes, do laugh them to scorne which vse to weare many stones, specially such as are common, iudging it to be an effeminate thyng, and more meete for women then men. The noble men onely, when they celebrate solemne mariages, or set foorth any triumphes, weare cheynes of gold, beset with precious stones, and vse fayre apparel of silke, embrodered with golde, intermixt with pearles and precious stones, and not at other tymes.

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:22913:129"/>
we ought to consyder that this lande bringeth foorth great plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of golde, and precious stones.

To be short therefore, al thynges do so floryshe, growe, encrease, and prosper, that the last are euer better then the fyrst. And surely to declare my opinion herein, whatsoeuer hath heretofore ben discouered by the famous trauayles of <hi>Saturnus</hi> and <hi>Hercules,</hi> with suche other whom the antiquitie for their heroical factes honoured as gods, seemeth but litle and obscure, if it be compared to the Spanyar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des victorious labours.

of them certayne strange thynges, wherein partly they take pleasure, and partly vse them for theyr necessary affayres. These people dwell not togeather, but scattered here and there.

                        <hi>Queraqueiera,</hi> or <hi>Carucuiera</hi>) haue in our tyme violently taken out of the sayde Ilande of <hi>Sancti Iohannis,</hi> more then fyue thousande men to be eaten.

We haue oftentymes sayd before, that <hi>Iucca</hi> is a roote, whereof the best and most delicate bread is made, both in the firme lande of these regions, and also in the Ilandes: but howe it is tylled or husbanded, howe it groweth, and of how dyuers kyndes it is, I haue not yet declared. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,<note place="margin">The manner of plantyng the roote Iucca.</note> when they entende to plant this <hi>Iucca,</hi> they make a hole in the earth, knee deepe, and rayse a heape of the earth taken out of the same, fashionyng it lyke a square bedde, of niene foote breadth on euery syde, settyng twelue trunkes of these roots (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng about a foote and a halfe long a peece) in euery of the sayd beddes, contaynyng three rootes of a syde, so layde a slope, that the endes of them ioyne in maner togeather in the center or mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest of the bedde within the ground. Out of the ioyntes of the rootes, and spaces betwene the same, spryng the toppes and blades of newe rootes, whiche by litle and litle encreasyng, growe to the bygnes and length of a mans arme in the brawne, and oftentymes as bygge as the thygh: so that by the tyme of theyr full rypenes,<note place="margin">Earth turned into rootes.</note> in maner all the earth of the heape is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted into rootes.

When they are taken foorth of the earth,<note place="margin">Howe bread is made of rootes</note> they scrape them, and slyse them, with certayne sharpe stones, seruyng for the same purpose: And thus laying them betwene two great stones, or puttyng them in a sacke made of the stalkes of certaine tough hearbes and smal reedes, they presse them (as do we cheese or crabbes, to drawe out the iuice thereof) and so let them drye a daye before they eate them. The iuice or liquour they cast away: for (as we haue sayde) it is deadly poyson in the Ilandes. Yet is the iuice of

suche as growe in the firme land wholesome, yf it be sodde, as is the whey of our mylke.

They say furthermore, that there are lykewyse diuers kyndes of the rootes of <hi>Ages,</hi> and <hi>Battata.</hi> But they vse these rather as fruites, and dyshes of seruice, then to make bread thereof, as we vse Rapes, Radishes, Mushromes, Nauies, Persnippes, and suche lyke. In this case, they moste especiallye esteeme the best kynde of <hi>Battatas,</hi> which in pleasant taste and tendernesse, farre exceedeth our Mushromes. It shal suffise to haue sayd thus much of rootes: We wyl nowe therefore speake of another kynde of their bread. We declared before, that they haue a kynde of grayne or Pulse, muche lyke vnto <hi>Panicum,</hi> but with somewhat bygger graynes,<note place="margin">Panicum is a grayne some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what lyke mil: The Italians cal it Melica.</note> which they beate into meale, vpon certaine great hollow stones, with the labour of theyr handes, when they lacke <hi>Iucca,</hi> and of this is made the more vulgar or common bread. It is sowen thryse a yeere, so that the fruitefulnesse of the ground may beare it, by reason of the equalitie of the tyme, whereof we haue spoken sufficiently before.

The which whyle I consyder, I am drawen into no small ambiguitie and doubt, whyther those waters haue theyr course, whiche flowe with so continuall a tract in circuite from the East, as though they fledde to the west, neuer to returne, and yet neyther the west thereby any whit the more fylled, nor the East emptied. If we shall say that they fall to theyr centre (as is the nature of heauie thynges) and assigne the Equinoctiall line to bee the centre (as some affyrme) what centre shall we appoynt to be able to receiue so great abundance of water?<note place="margin">

Thus seeyng suche heapes of Ise before hym, he was enforced to turne his sayles, and folowe the west, so coastyng styll by the shore, that he was thereby brought so farre into the south, by reason of the lande bendyng so muche southwarde, that it was there almost equall in latitude with the sea called <hi>Fretum Herculeum,</hi> hauyng the north pole eleuate in maner in the same degree. He sayled lykewyse in this tract so farre towarde the west, that he had the Ilande of <hi>Cuba</hi> on his left hande, in maner in the same degree of longitude.

Wherefore, it is not onely more lyke to be true, but ought also of necessitie to be concluded, that betwene both the landes hitherto vnknowen, there shoulde be certayne great open places, wherby the waters should thus continually passe from the East into the west: whiche waters I suppose to be dryuen about the globe of the earth by the vncessaunt mouyng and impulsion of the heauens, and not to beswalowed vp and cast out agayne by the breathyng of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogorgon,</hi>

Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the day after that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nauie arriued, there assembled a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Spanyards thinhabitours of <hi>Dariena,</hi> to the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of foure hundred and fiftie men. <hi>Petrus Arias</hi> the gouernour of the nauy, and his companye, conferred with them both priuilie and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye of certayne articles, whereof it was the kynges pleasure he shoulde enquire: and most especially as concernyng suche thynges wherof <hi>Vaschus</hi> the fyrst fynder and Admirall of the South sea, made mention in his large letter sent from <hi>Dariena</hi> to Spayne. In this inquisition they founde althyngs to be true whereof <hi>Vaschus</hi> had certified the king by his letters, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon concluded, that in the dominions of <hi>Comogra, Pocchorrosa</hi> &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:22913:137"/>
                        <hi>Tumanama</hi> at the assignement of <hi>Vaschus,</hi> certayne fortresses shoulde be erected foorthwith, to thintent there to plant theyr co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonie or habitation.<note place="margin">Where the new gouernour planteth his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation.</note> To the better accomplyshment hereof, they sent immediatly one <hi>Iohannes Aiora,</hi> a noble young gentleman of <hi>Corduba,</hi> and vnder Lieuetenant, with foure hundred men, and foure Carauels, and one other lytle shyp. Thus departyng, he sayled fyrst directly to the hauen of <hi>Comogrus,</hi> distant from <hi>Darie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> about twentie and fyue leagues, as they wryte in theyr last letters. From hence, he is appoynted to send a hundred and fyftie of his foure hundred, towarde the South, by a newe and ryghter way founde of late, by the whiche (as they say) it is not past twentie and syxe leagues from the pallace of kyng <hi>Comogrus</hi> to the entraunce of the gulfe of <hi>Sancti Michaelis.</hi> The residue of the foure hundred shal remayne there, to be an ayde and succour to al such as shall iorney to and fro. Those hundred and fyftie whiche are assigned to go southward, take with them for inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretours certain of our men, which had learned the soothern lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the bondmen which were geuen to <hi>Vaschus</hi> when he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerranne those regions, and also certayne of the bondemen them selues which had nowe learned the Spanyshe tongue. They say that the hauen of <hi>Pocchorrosa</hi> is only seuen leagues distant from the hauen of <hi>Comogrus.</hi> In <hi>Pocchorrosa</hi> he is assigned to leaue fyftie men,<note place="margin">A passinger shyp.</note> with the lightest ship, which may be a passinger betwene them: that like as we vse post horses by land, so may they by this currant shyp, in short space certifie the Lieuetenaunt and thinhabitours of <hi>Dariena</hi> of such thynges as shal chaunce. They entend also to build houses in the region of <hi>Tumanama.</hi> The pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of king <hi>Tumanama,</hi> is distant fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                        <hi>Pocchorrosa</hi> about twenty leagues. Of these foure hundred men, beyng of the olde souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of <hi>Dariena,</hi> &amp; men of good experience, fyftie were appointed to be as it were Decurians,<note place="margin">Decurians are officers deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into tennes &amp;c.</note> to guide and conduct the new men from place to place to do theyr affayres. When they had thus set all thynges in order, they thought it good to aduertyse the kyng hereof, and therwith to certyfye hym, that in those prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces there is a kyng named <hi>Dabaiba,</hi> whose dominion is verye ryche in gold: but the same to be yet vntouched by reason of his great power.<note place="margin">The gold mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Dabai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba.</note> His kyngdome ioyneth to the second great ryuer, named <hi>Dabaiba</hi> after his name, whiche falleth into the

sea out of the corner of the gulfe of <hi>Vraba,</hi> as we haue largely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared before. The common report is, that all the land of his dominions is ryche in gold. The pallace of kyng <hi>Dabaiba</hi> is fyftie leagues distant from <hi>Dariena.</hi> The inhabitantes saye, that from the pallace, the gold mynes reache to the borders on euery syde. Albeit our men haue also golde mynes not to be contemned, euen within three leagues of <hi>Dariena,</hi> in the whiche they geather golde in many places at this present: Yet do they affirme greater plentye to be in the mynes of <hi>Dabaiba.</hi> In the bookes of our fyrst fruites, written to your holynesse, we made mention of this <hi>Dabaiba,</hi> wherein our men were deceyued,<note place="margin">An errour.</note> and mystooke the matter: For where they founde the fyshermen of kyng <hi>Dabaiba</hi> in the marishes, they thought his region had been there also. They determined therfore to send to kyng <hi>Dabaiba,</hi> three hundred choyse young men, to be chosen out of the whole army, as most apt to the warres, and well furnyshed with all kyndes of armour and artyllerie, to the intent to go vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hym, and wyll hym, eyther frendly and peaceably to permit them to inhabite part of his kyngdome, with the fruition of the golde mynes, or els to byd hym battayle, and dryue hym out of his countrey. In theyr letters, they oftentymes repeate this for an argument of great ryches to come, that they in a maner dygged the ground in no place, but found the earth myxt with sparkes and small graynes of golde. They haue also aduertised the kyng, that it shalbe commodious to place inhabitours in the hauen of <hi>Sancta Martha,</hi> in the region of <hi>Saturma,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The region of Saturma.

For the returnyng from thence is so laborious and difficulte,<note place="margin">Difficult say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng agaynst the course of the sea.</note> by reason of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary course of the water, that they seeme as it were to ascende hyghe mountaynes, and stryue agaynste the power of <hi>Neptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi> This swyft course of the sea towards the west, is not so vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent to them whiche returne to Spayne from the Ilandes of <hi>Hispaniola</hi> and <hi>Cuba,</hi> although they also do labour agaynst the fall of the Ocean: The cause whereof is, that the sea is

heere very large, so that the waters haue theyr full scope. But in the tract of <hi>Paria,</hi> the waters are constrayned togeather by the bendyng sydes of that great land, and by the multitude of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landes lying agaynst it, as the lyke is seene in the strayghtes or narrow seas of Scicile, where the violent course of the waters cause the daungerous places of <hi>Scilla</hi> and <hi>Caribdis</hi> by reason of those narrowe seas which conteyne <hi>Ionium,</hi>

Let vs nowe therefore rehearse what they wryte of <hi>Dariena,</hi> and of theyr habitation there, whiche they cal <hi>Sancta Maria Antiqua,</hi> planted on the sea bankes of <hi>Dariena.</hi> The situation of the place, hath no natural munition or defence, and the ayre is more pestife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous then in <hi>Sardus.</hi> The Spanishe inhabitours are al pale and yelowe, lyke vnto them whiche haue the yelowe iaundies: which neuerthelesse commeth not of the nature of the region, as it is si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate vnder the heauen. For in many regions beyng vnder the selfe same degree of latitude, hauing the pole of the same eleuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they fynd holsome &amp; temperate ayre, in such places where as the earth bryngeth foorth fayre sprynges of water, or where hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some riuers runne by bankes of pure earth without mudde: but most especially where they inhabite the sides of the hyls, and not the valleys. But that habitation whiche is on the bankes of the ryuer of <hi>Dariena,</hi> is situate in a deepe valley, and enuironed
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:22913:138"/>
on euery syde with hygh hylles: By reason wherof, it receyueth the Sonne beames at noonetyde dyrectly parpendicular ouer theyr heades, and are therefore sore vexed by reflection of the beames, both before, behynde, and from the sydes. For it is the reflection of the sonne beames whiche causeth feruent heate,<note place="margin">By what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes the Sonne beames are cause of fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent heate.</note> and not theyr accesse or neerenesse to the earth, forasmuche as they are not passyble in themselues, as doth manifestly appeare by the snowe lying contynually vnmoulten vpon certayne hygh mountaynes, as your holynesse knoweth ryght well. The sonne beames therfore fallyng on the mountaynes, are reflected down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde into the valley, by reason of the obiect of the declining sydes of the hylles, as it were the fall of a great round stone, rowled from the toppe of a mountayne. The valley therefore receyueth both those beames whiche fall directly thereon, and also those whiche are reflected downewarde from euery syde of the mountaynes. Theyr habitation therefore in <hi>Driena,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The pernitious ayre of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riena.</note> is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious and vnholsome, onely of the particuler nature of the place, and not by the situation of the region as it is plased vnder the heauen, or neare to the sonne. The place is also contagious by the nature of the soyle, by reason it is compassed about with muddy and stynkyng marishes, the infection whereof is not a lytle encreased by the heate. The vyllage is selfe is in a marishe, and in maner a standyng puddle, where, of the droppes fallyng from the handes of the bondemen, whyle they water the paue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of theyr houses, Toades are engendred immediately,<note place="margin">Toades and Flees engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of drops of water.</note> as I my selfe saw in an other place the droppes of that water turne into flees in the sommer season. Furthermore, wheresoeuer they dygge the grounde the deapth of a handful and a halfe, there spryngeth out vnholsome and corrupt water, of the nature of the ryuer, whiche runneth through the deepe and muddye chanell of the valley, and so falleth into the sea: Nowe therfore they consult of remouyng theyr inhabitations.

<pb facs="tcp:22913:139"/>
rysyng from the same. An other great incommoditie was, that the place was destitute of a commodious hauen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng three leagues distant from the mouth of the gulfe: The way is also rough and difficult to bryng vyttayles and other necessaries from the sea. But let vs nowe speake somewhat of other particuler thynges whiche chaunced. Therefore short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after that they were arryued, there happened many thynges whereof they had no knowledge before. A certayne well learned phisition of Ciuile, whom partly the auctoritie of the Bishop of <hi>Dariena,</hi> and partly the desyre of golde, had allured to those landes, was so scarred with lyghtnyng in the nyght season, lying in bedde with his wyfe, that the house and all the stuffe therein beyng set on fyre and burnt,<note place="margin">A house set on fyre with light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng.</note> he and his wyfe beyng both sore scorched, ranne foorth crying, and almost na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, hardely escapyng the daunger of death.

If these Battes chaunce to fynde a cocke or a henne abrode in the nyght season, they byte them by the combes, and so kyl them.

But of these <hi>Nereiades</hi> (that is to saye, the Ilandes placed about her) we wyll speake more hereafter.

In the description hereof, we wyll begynne of the imposition of dyuers names, then of the fourme of the Ilande, temperate ayre, and beneficial heauen, and finally of the deuision of the regions. Therefore for the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pronunciation of the names, your holynesse must vnderstande, that they are pronounced with thaccent, as you may knowe by the verge set ouer the heddes of the vowels, as in the name of the Ilande <hi>Matinino,</hi> where the accent is in the last vowell, and the lyke to be vnderstoode in all other names.

Within the mouth of the ryuer of <hi>Bahaboni,</hi> lyeth an Ilande, where it is sayde that thinhabitantes buylded theyr fyrst house, whiche they named <hi>Camoteia.</hi> This house they consecrated shortly after, and honoured the same reuerently, with continual gyftes and monumentes, euen vntyll the commyng of our men, lyke as the Christians haue euer religiously honoured Ierusalem the fountayne and originall of our fayth:<note place="margin">Hierusalem.</note> As also the Turkes attribute the lyke to the citie of <hi>Mecha</hi> in Araby, and the inhabitantes of the fortunate Ilandes (called the Ilandes of Canarie) to <hi>Tyrma,</hi> buylded vppon a hygh rocke,<note place="margin">Mecha.

But let vs nowe returne to thinhabitantes of <hi>Matinino</hi> and <hi>Hispaniola.</hi> The Iland of <hi>Hispaniola</hi> was first named by the first inhabitours <hi>Quizqueia,</hi> and then <hi>Haiti</hi>: and this not by chaunce,<note place="margin">The first na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of Hispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niola.</note> or at the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of suche as diuised these names, but of credulitie and beleefe of some great effecte. For <hi>Quizqueia,</hi> is as muche to say as, A great thyng, and that so great, that none may be greater.

But by a fyguratiue speache called denomination (whereby the whole is named by part) they named the whole Ilande <hi>Haiti</hi> (that is) rough: Forasmuche as in many places the face of this Ilande is rough, by reason of the craggie mountaynes, horrible thicke wooddes, and terribly darke and deepe valleys, enuironed with great &amp; high mountaynes, although it be in manye other places exceedyng beautifull and floryshyng.

But this shypmaister hath brought an other des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription, obserued of the inhabitauntes from the beginnyng.
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:22913:144"/>
Let vs therfore diuide the whole Iland into fiue partes, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng the regions of euery prouince by theyr olde names: and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally make mention of such thyngs as are worthy memory in euery of them. The beginning of the Ilande on the East syde, is conteyned in the prouince named <hi>Caizcimu,</hi> so named for that in theyr language <hi>Cimu</hi> signifieth the front or beginning of anye thyng. After this, foloweth the prouince of <hi>Huhabo,</hi> and then <hi>Caihabo,</hi> the fourth is <hi>Bainoa. Guaccaiarima</hi> conteyneth the west corner. But the last saue one, <hi>Bainoa</hi> is of larger boundes then the three other. <hi>Caizcimu</hi> reacheth from the fyrst front of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to the ryuer <hi>Hozama,</hi> which runneth by the citie of saint Dominicke. But towarde the North syde,<note place="margin">The citie of S. Dominick.</note> it is ended at the rough mountaynes of <hi>Haiti. Hubaho,</hi> is encluded within the mountaynes <hi>Haiti</hi> and the ryuer <hi>Iaciga. Caeiabo</hi> the thyrd pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince, conteineth al that lyeth between <hi>Cubabo</hi> and <hi>Dahatio,</hi> euen vnto the mouth of the ryuer of <hi>Iaceha</hi> or <hi>Iache</hi> (one of the foure which diuide the Iland equally) &amp; ascendeth to the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes of <hi>Cibaua,</hi> where the greatest plenty of gold is found, out of the which also the ryuer <hi>Demahus</hi> spryngeth: and ioining with the sprynges of the ryuer of <hi>Naiba</hi> (beyng an other of the foure which diuideth the Iland toward the south sea) falleth to an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther banke of the riuer of saint Dominick. <hi>Bainoa,</hi> beginneth at the confines of <hi>Caiabi,</hi> and reacheth euen vnto the Iland of <hi>Cahi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,</hi> which lyeth neare vnto the sea bankes of the North syde of the Iland, where we sayde that they erected y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first colonie or habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The prouince of <hi>Guaccaiarima,</hi> occupieth the remanent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the west: this they named <hi>Guaccaiarima,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Of prouinces diuided into regions.</note> because it is the extreeme or vttermost part of the Iland. For <hi>Iarima</hi> in theyr lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, signifieth the tayle or end of any thing, and <hi>Gua,</hi> is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle which they vse oftentimes in the names of things, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the names of theyr kinges, as <hi>Guarionexius</hi> &amp; <hi>Guaccana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillus.</hi> In the prouince of <hi>Cazium,</hi> are these regions, <hi>Higuei, Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nama, Reyre, Xagua, Aramana, Arabo, Hazoa, Macorix, Caiacoa, Guaiagua, Baguauimabo,</hi> &amp; the rough mountaines of <hi>Haiti.</hi> Here let vs speake somwhat of their aspirations, which they vse other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then the Latines do. It is to be noted that there is no aspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in their vowels, which hath not the effect of a consonant. So that they pronounce theyr aspirations more vehemently then
<pb facs="tcp:22913:145"/>
we do the consonant .f. Yea, all suche wordes as in theyr tongue are aspirate, are pronounced with lyke breath and spirite as is f. sauyng that heerin the neather lippe is not moued to the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permost teeth.

I fynde also that the Spanyardes vse the lyke vehemencie in the aspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of those wordes which they haue receyued of the Moores &amp; Arabians which possessed Spaine, and continued there many yeeres, as in these wordes <hi>Almohadda,</hi> which signifieth a pyllow or boulster, also <hi>Almohaza,</hi> that is a horse combe: with diuers such other wordes, which they speake in maner w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> panting brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes, and vehement spirite. I haue thought it good to rehearse these thyngs, because among the Latines it oftentimes so chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth, that only the accent or aspiration, chaungeth the significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the worde, as <hi>hora,</hi> for an houre, and <hi>ora,</hi> for the plurale number of this worde <hi>os,</hi>

But let vs now returne to the discription. In the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince of <hi>Hubabo,</hi> are these regions, <hi>Xamana, Canabacoa, Cubabo,</hi> with many other,<note place="margin">Diuers lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages in the Iland.</note> the names wherof I haue not yet learned.

Lykewyse the region of <hi>Baiohagua,</hi> hath a diuers tongue. There are also o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther regions, as <hi>Dahabon, Cybaho,</hi> and <hi>Manababo.

By this runneth the riuer <hi>Nizaus,</hi> and the mountaines called <hi>Mathaitin, Hazua,</hi> &amp; <hi>Neibaymao,</hi> confine w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the same.

Taquenazabo, Nimaca, Baiona</hi> the lesse, <hi>Cabaini, Iamaici, Mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baxao, Zauana, Habacoa,</hi> and <hi>Ayquiora.</hi> But let vs entreate some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the particulers of the regions. In the prouince of <hi>Caiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimu,</hi> within the great gulfe of the beginning, there is a great caue in a hollow rocke vnder the roote of a high mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tayne, about two furlonges from the sea, the entry of this caue is not muche vnlyke the doores of a great temple, beyng very large, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning many wayes. <hi>Andreas Moralis</hi> the shypmaister, at the commaundement of the gouernour, attempted to search the caue with the smalest vessels. He sayeth that by certayne priuie waies many ryuers haue concourse to this caue,<note place="margin">Riuers denou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of caues.</note> as it were a syncke or chanel. After thexperience hereof, they ceassed to marueyle whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther other riuers ranne, which comming fourscore and ten miles were swalowed vp, so that they appeered no more, nor yet fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the sea by any knowen wayes. Nowe therefore they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that ryuers swalowed vp by the hollowe places of that stony mountayne, fall into this caue. As the shypmaister entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the caue, his shyp was almost swalowed. For he sayth, that there are many whyrlepooles and rysinges or boylynges of the water, whiche make a violent conflict and horrible roryng, one encounteryng the other:<note place="margin">Whirlepooles, and conflict of waters.</note> also many huge holes and hollowe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, so that what on the one syde with whirlpooles, and on the other syde with the boylyng of the water, his shyppe was long in maner tossed vp and downe like a ball. It greatlye repented hym that he had entred, yet knew he no way how to come foorth. He now wandred in darknesse, aswell for the obscurenesse of the caue into the which he was farre entred, as also that in it were thicke clouds,<note place="margin">Cloudes in the caue.</note> engendred of the moist vapours proceeding of the conflict of the waters, which continually fal with great violence into the caue on euery syde. He compareth the noyse of these waters,<note place="margin">The Cataracts of Nilus.</note> to the fal of the famous ryuer <hi>Nilus</hi> from the mountains of Ethiope, they were also deafe, that one coulde not heare what an other saide. But at the length with great daunger and feare, he came foorth of the caue, as it had been out of hell. About three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score myles distant from the cheefe citie of sainct Dominicke, there are certayne hygh mountaynes,<note place="margin">A standing poole in the top of a high mountayne.</note> vpon the toppes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is a lake or standing poole inaccessible, neuer yet seene of them which came latelye to the Ilande, both by reason of the rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughnesse
<pb facs="tcp:22913:146"/>
of the mountaynes, and also for that there is no pathe or open way to the toppes of the same. But at the length the shypmaister beyng conducted thyther by one of the kynges, ascended to the toppes of the mountaynes, and came to the poole.<note place="margin">Fearne and bramble bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes, growe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in colde regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> He sayth that the colde is there of some force: and in token of wynter, he founde fearne and bramble bushes, whiche two growe only in colde regions. These mountaines, they call <hi>Ymizui Hibabaino.</hi> This poole is of freshe water three myles in compasse, and well replenyshed with diuers kyndes of fyshes. Many small riuers or brookes fall into it. It hath no passage out, bycause it is on euery syde enclosed with the toppes of moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes. But let vs nowe speake of an other poole, whiche may well be called a sea in the mydlande, and be compared to the Caspian or Hircanian sea in the fyrme lande of <hi>Asia,</hi> with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne other lakes and pooles of freshe water.<note place="margin">The Caspian and Hircanian sea.</note>

This lake, because it hath no passage out, nor yet any swalowyng gulfes, conueyeth the superfluous waters to the sea, if it be encreased with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> streames which fal sometymes more abundantly from the mountaynes: this is in the region of <hi>Xamana</hi> in the prouince of <hi>Bainoa.</hi> There is an other called <hi>Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aniba,</hi> lying betwene the East and the South, neere vnto the syde of <hi>Caspius:</hi> this is ten myles in length, and almost round.

All these lakes lye in a large playne, the whiche from the East reacheth into the West a hundreth and twentie miles, being of breadth .xviii. miles where it is narowest,<note place="margin">A playne of a hundred and twenty myles</note> and .xxv. where it is largest.

This vale in some parte thereof, is called <hi>Maguana,</hi> in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, <hi>Iguaniu,</hi> and els where, <hi>Hathathiei.</hi> And forasmuch as we haue here made mention of this parte of the vale named <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thathiei,</hi> we will somewhat digresse from the discourse of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription, and entreate of a thing so straunge and marueilous, that the lyke hath not been hearde of. So it is therefore, that the kyng of this region named <hi>Caramatexius,</hi> taketh great pleasure in fyshing. Into his nettes chaunced a young fyshe, of the kynde of those huge monsters of the sea which thinhabitours call <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nati,</hi> not founde I suppose in our seas,<note place="margin">The maruey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous fyshe Manati.</note> nor knowne to our men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this tyme. This fyshe is foure footed, and in shape lyke vnto a Tortoyse, although shee be not couered with a shell, but with scales, and those of such hardnesse, &amp; couched in such order, that no arrow can hurte her. Her scales are beset &amp; defended with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sande knobbes, her backe is playne, and her head vtterly lyke the head of an Oxe. She lyueth both in the water, &amp; on the lande, shee is slowe of mouyng, of condition meeke, gentle, associable,<note place="margin">A monster of the sea fedde with mans hande.</note> and louing to mankynde, and of a marueilous sense or memorie, as are the Elephant and the Delphyn. The kyng norished this fysh certeine dayes at home with the bread of the countrey, made of the roote of <hi>Iucca</hi> &amp; <hi>Panycke,</hi> &amp; with such other rootes as men are accustomed to eate: For when shee was yet but young, hee cast her into a poole or lake neare vnto his palace, there to be fed with hande. This lake also receiueth waters, and casteth not the same foorth againe. It was in tyme paste called <hi>Guaurabo:</hi> but is now called the lake of <hi>Manati,</hi> after the name of this fyshe, which wandered safely in the same for the space of .xxv. yeeres, and grewe exceeding byg. Whatsoeuer is written of the Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phines of Baian or Arion, are muche inferior to the dooinges of this fyshe, whiche for her gentle nature they named <hi>Matum,</hi> that is, gentle, or noble. Therefore whensoeuer any of the kynges familyers, especially such as are knowne to her, resorte to the bankes of the lake, and call <hi>Matum, Matum,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Matum.</note> then she (as mynde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of such benefites as shee hath receyued of men) lifteth vp her

From that day whensoeuer shee was called by any of her familiers, she would fyrst looke circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectly about her, least any were present apparelled after the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Christians. She would oftentymes play and wrestle vppon the banke with the kynges chamberlens, and especially with a young man whom the kyng fauoured well, being also ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to feede her. Shee would bee sometymes as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saunt and full of play as it had been a moonkey or marmaset, and was of long tyme a great comfort and solace to the whole Iland: For no small confluence aswell of the Christians as of thinhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantes, had dayly concourse to beholde so straunge a myracle of nature, the contemplation whereof was no lesse pleasaunt then wonderfull.

So it is, that our men hauyng granges adioyning neere vnto the thicke woods, certaine of them repaired thither in the moneth of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, in the yeere .M.D.xiiii. in the meane tyme, one of these wylde men came leapyng out of the wood,<note place="margin">A wylde man runnech away with a chylde.</note> &amp; approchyng some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what towarde them with smyling countenaunce, sodeinly snat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched vp a chylde of theyrs, being the sonne of the owner of the grange, which he begot of a woman of the Ilande: Hee ranne away with the chylde, and made signes to our men to folowe hym: Many folowed, aswell of our men, as of the naked inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitantes, but all in vayne. Thus when the pleasaunt wande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer perceyued that the Christians ceassed to pursue hym, hee left the chylde in a crosse way by the which the swyneheardes were accustomed to dryue the swyne to theyr pasture.

This messenger, whether it were that he was thereto constrayned through hunger, or entysed by appetite, deuoured three of the Connies by the way. He to whom they were sent, wrote to his freende in a leafe howe many he receyued.

We must then needes thinke that this was very precious, whiche was bought so deare among such a multitude of pearles, where they were not bought by one at once, but by poundes, and at the least by ounces. It is also to be thought that the Uenecian marchaunt bought his for no great summe of money in the East partes: But he solde it the dearer,<note place="margin">Nyse and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous pleasures.</note> for that he chaunced to lyue in those lasciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and wanton dayes, when men were giuen to such nyse and superfluous pleasures, and met with a marchant for his purpose.

But these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, and our men, rest onely in one assertion, not assentyng to them in any other: as, eyther that they wander in the sea, or, that they moue at any tyme after they are borne. They will therefore that there be certayne greene places, as it were mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes,<note place="margin">Hearbes in the bottome of the sea.</note> in the bottome of the sea, bringing foorth an hearbe much lyke vnto Tyme, and affyrme that they haue seene the same, and that they are engendred, noryshed, and growe therein, as wee see thincrease and succession of Oysters to grow about them selues: Also that these fyshes delyghteth not in the conuersation or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the sea dogges, nor yet to bee contented with onely one, two, or three, or at the most foure pearles, affyrmyng that in the fyshyng places of the kyng of this Ilande, there was founde a hundred pearles in one fyshe, the whiche <hi>Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par Moralis</hi> the captayne him selfe,<note place="margin">A hundred pearles in one shell fyshe.</note> and his companions, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently numbred: For it pleased the kyng at theyr beyng there, and in their presence, to commaunde his dyuers to goe a fyshyng for those kynde of fyshes. They compare the matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:22913:158"/>
of these fyshes, to the places of conception in Hennes,<note place="margin">The matrice of the pearle fyshe.</note> in the whiche theyr egges are engendred in great multitudes and clusters, and beleue that these fyshes bryng foorth theyr byrth in lyke maner. For the better proofe whereof, they say that they founde certayne pearles commyng foorth of their matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,<note place="margin">The byrth of pearles.</note> as beyng nowe come to the tyme of theyr full rypenesse, and moued by nature to come out of theyr moothers wombe, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penyng it selfe in tyme conuenient: lykewyse, that within a whyle after, they sawe other succeede in lyke maner. So that to conclude, they sawe some commyng foorth, and other some yet abydyng the tyme of theyr perfection: which beyng com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete, they also became loose, and opened the matrice. They perceyued the pearles to bee inclosed in the myddest of theyr bellyes, there to bee nourished and increase, as an infant sucking his moothers pappes within her wombe, before hee moue to come foorth of her priuie places. And if it chaunce any of these shelfyshes to bee founde scattered in the sande of the sea (as I my selfe haue seene Oysters disparcled on the shores in dyuers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Ocean) they affyrme that they haue been violently dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen thither from the bottome of the sea by force of tempestes, and not to haue wandered thither of them selues: But, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come whyte by the clearenesse of the mornyng deawe, or waxe yelowe in troubled weather, or otherwyse that they seeme to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in fayre weather and cleare ayre, or contrarywyse, to bee as it were astonyshed and dymme in thunder and tempestes, with suche other: the perfect knowledge hereof, is not to bee loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for at the handes of these vnlearned men, whiche handle the matter but grossely, and enquyre no further then occasion ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth. Yet doe they affyrme by thexperience and industrie of the dyuers, that the greatest pearles lye in the deepest places,<note place="margin">Where the biggest, meane, and least pearls are engendred.</note> they of the meane sort hygher, and the least hyghest of all, and neerer to the brymme of the water: And say therfore, that the greatest doe not wander, but that they are created, nouryshed, and increase in the deepest places of the sea, whyther fewe dyuers (and that but seeldome) dare aduenture to diue so deepe to geather them, aswell for feare of the sea crabbes, whiche wander among these pearle fyshes to feede of them,<note place="margin">Sea crabbes.</note> and for feare of other monsters of the sea, as also least their breath should fayle them in to long
<pb facs="tcp:22913:159"/>
remayning in the water: And this they say to bee the cause why the oldest (&amp; therfore byggest) sea muscles inhabite y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deepest pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,<note place="margin">The sea mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles wherein pearles are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred.</note> from whence they are not lightly moued by tempestes. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, how much the bygger &amp; older these fyshes are, they say that in their larger matrices, the greater number &amp; bigger pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les are founde, &amp; that for this cause there are fewer founde of the byggest sort. They thinke also, that when they first fall from their fyshes in the deepe places, they are deuoured of other fyshes, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are not yet hearde. Againe, the smallest differ from the byggest in a certaine swelling or impostumation, which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niardes call a tympany: For they deny that to be a pearle which in olde muscles cleaueth faste to the shell, but that it is a wart, which being rased from the shell with a fyle, is rounde &amp; bryght but onely of one syde, and not precious, being rather of the nature of the fyshe it selfe, then of a pearle. They confesse that they haue seene certayne of these muscles cleauyng on rockes, yet these but fewe, and nothyng woorth. It is also to bee thought, that the pearle fyshes or sea muscles which are founde in India, Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia, the redde sea, or Taprobana, are ruled in suche order as the aforenamed famous aucthours haue written: For their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on herein is not vtterly to bee reiected, forasmuch as they were learned men, and trauayled long in the searchyng of these thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. But wee haue nowe spoken sufficiently of these sea fyshes, and of their egges, which the fonde nysenesse and wantonnesse of men haue made deerer then the egges of hennes or geese. Let vs therefore entreate somewhat of other perticular thinges, which are come to our knowledge of late. Wee haue elswhere largely described the mouthes of the gulfe of <hi>Vraba,</hi> with sundry and variable regions diuided with the manifolde gulfes of that sea: But as concernyng the West coastes, in the which our men haue buylded houses, and planted their habitations on the bankes of <hi>Dariena,</hi> I haue no newe matter to wryte.

But they beyng stricken with feare through this example, durst not come foorth of their shyppes, or deuise how to reuenge the death of theyr Captayne and companyons.

Of these thynges I was aduertised of late by theyr owne letters.

Our men sent foorth a fewe foote men, and with them theyr Laundresses to washe theyr shertes and sheetes: For from the Iland of <hi>Ferrea,</hi> beyng one of the Ilandes of Canarie (euen vnto this Iland, for the space of foure thousand and two hundred myles) they had seene no land, where they myght fynde any fresh water, foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muche as in all this large space the Ocean is without Ilandes.

I haue heere for this cause entred into the declaration of theyr maner of huntyng and foulyng, that by these more pleasaunt narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I may somewhat mittigate and asswage the horrour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued in your stomake by the former rehearsal of theyr blooddy actes and cruell maners.

So it is therfore, that <hi>Andreas Moralis</hi> the pilot, and <hi>Ouiedus</hi> (of whom wee haue made mention before) repay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to mee, at my house in the towne of Matrite. As we met thus togeather, there arose a contention betweene them two, as concernyng this course of the Ocean. They both agree, that these landes and regions parteynyng to the dominion of Castile,<note place="margin">The continent or fyrme lande.</note> doe with one continual tract &amp; perpetual bond, embrase as one whole firme lande or continent, all the mayne lande lying on the North side of <hi>Cuba,</hi> &amp; the other Ilands, being also Northwest both from <hi>Cuba</hi> &amp; <hi>Hispaniola:</hi> Yet as touching the course of the water, they varry in opinion. For <hi>Andreas</hi> wil that this violent course of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be receiued in the lappe of the supposed continent, which ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth so much, and extendeth so farre towarde the North, as wee haue sayde: and that by the obiect or resistance of the lande, so bending and crookyng, the water should as it were rebounde in compasse, and by force thereof bee driuen about the North syde of <hi>Cuba,</hi> and the other Ilands, excluded without y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> circle cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Tropicus Cancri,</hi> where the largenes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sea may receiue the waters falling from the narow streames, &amp; therby represse that inordinate course, by reason that the sea is there very large and great. I can compare his meanyng to nothing more aptely, then to the swyft streame commyng foorth of a myll, and fallyng into the myll poole: For in all such places where waters runne with a violent fall through narowe chanelles, and are then receyued in large pooles, they are sodeynly disparcled, and theyr violence broken: So that whereas before they seemed of suche force as

Thus haue we made you partener of suche thinges as they haue giuen vs, and written their dyuers opinions: We will then giue more certayne reason, when more certayne trueth shalbe knowne.

After this banquet, the kyng with his trayne and famylie brought our men into a brode crosse way, where many streates do meete: In this, they shewed them as it were a great and high alter, buylded foure square of marble,<note place="margin">Theyr Idoles and Idolatry.</note> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacte togeather partly with the tough cleye of Babilon called <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumem,</hi> and partly with small stones, it had on euery syde foure stayres: Upon the altare was an Image of a man made of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and fast by it the images of two beastes of vnknowen shape, which seemed as though they woulde with yanyng mouth haue torne in sunder the belly of the mans Image.

At the spryng of the day, the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians approched to our mens campe, and called for the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretours of <hi>Cuba,</hi> whose language is much agreable vnto theirs. They had deuised to lyght a Torche of franckensence, and to place the same betweene both the armies, to the intent that yf our men dyd not depart before the Torche were consumed, to stand to theyr peryll.

Thus standyng in battayle raye to defende theyr coastes, and with proude countenaunces for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byddyng our men to come alande, both parties watched all that nyght in armes. In the dawne of they daye, our men es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyed about a hundred Canoas (whiche we haue sayde to bee theyr boates) full of armed men. Here also, the language of thinterpretours of <hi>Cuba</hi> agreed well yenough with theirs.

A certayne ruler that was in this Canoa, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded of our men what they sought in other mens landes. They answeared, Gold, and that for permutation of other ware, and not of gift, or violently. The <hi>Canoa</hi> returned, and the ruler certified the king hereof, who came gladly to the shippes. When he had saluted the gouernor, he called his chamberlaine vnto him, commaundyng hym to bryng his armur, and other ornamentes of gold, wherewith he armed <hi>Grisalua</hi> from the toppe of the head,<note place="margin">Armur of gold.</note> to the sole of the foote: insomuche that what so euer any man of armes, armed at all partes,<note place="margin">Expert artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers.</note> is among vs accustomed to weare of Iron or steele when he commeth into the fielde, all such kynde of furnitures made of golde, and wrought with woonderfull art, the kyng gaue to the gouernour. He recompenced hym with ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of sycke, cloth, lynnen, and other of our thynges.

But the gouernour denied that he could release hym, without the consent of his felowes, and therefore kept hym styll, to proue what he coulde further knowe of hym. Departyng from hence, and saylyng styll westwarde,<note place="margin">The Ilandes of Sacrifice.</note> they founde a great gulfe, in the which three small Ilandes were situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate: Of these, they went to the byggest.

standeth a Lion, hauyng a hole through the necke, into the whiche they poure the blood of the miserable sacrifyce, that it may from thence runne downe into a syncke of marble. Let vs nowe declare with what ceremonies they sacrifice the blood of these poore wretches. They cut not theyr throtes, but open the very brestes of these seelye soules, and take out theyr hartes yet pantyng, with the hot blood whereof, they annoynt the lippes of theyr Idoles, and suffer the resydue to fall into the syncke: This doone, they burne the harte and bowels, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posyng the smoke thereof to be acceptable to theyr goddes. Of theyr Idoles, one is made to the shape of a man, bowyng downe his head, and lookyng towarde the syncke of blood, as it were acceptyng the offeryng of the slayne sacrifyce. They eate the fleshe of the armes, thyghes, and legges, especially when they sacrifice an enimie taken in the warres. They founde a streame of coniealed blood, as though it had runne from a boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery. For this mischeuous purpose, they bring these wretches from the next Ilandes.

They shot at our men a farre of, and our men discharged certayne peeces of ordinaunce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them. The Barbarians astonished at the noyse of the gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes fled amayne, and desyred peace. Here our mens vitayles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to fayle them, and theyr shyppes were broosed with long viages.

                     <hi>Diegus Velasquen,</hi> the gouernour of the Ilande of <hi>Fernandina,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the same tyme that he had sent foorth this nauie of foure Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauelles, he prepared an other nauigation of onely one Carauell, and one brygantine, with fourtie and fyue men. These exercised violent handes against thinhabitauntes of those regions where they arryued, thynkyng that they myght forceably drawe them to the dyggyng of golde, bycause they were Caffranite Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and circumcised. There are at the sea syde not farre from the supposed continent,<note place="margin">Many Ilands betweene Cuba and the fyrme lande.</note> many litle Ilandes, of most fortunate and fruitefull soyle, whereof three are thus named, <hi>Guanapan, Guan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guan,</hi> and <hi>Quitilla.</hi> Out of one of these (which they named <hi>Sansta Marina</hi>) they violently caryed away three hundred men &amp; wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, which they thrust into the Carauell, and returned immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly to <hi>Fernandina,</hi> leauyng the brigantine with .xxv. of theyr felowes, to thintent to hunt for more men.

And by this meanes the Barbarians possessed the Carauell whiche they had soone learned to rule, and thus returned to their owne countreys. But they sayled fyrst to the nexte Ilande, where they burnt the Carauel, and caryed away the weapons with them. From hence they conueyed them selues to their owne countreys with the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noas of this Ila<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. Here in lyke maner they priuily assailed them that were left with the brigantine, and slue many of them also: The residue that escaped, fledde to the brigantine, where they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayled theyr felowes deathes, and counted theyr owne escape a victorie. On the shore not farre from the place where they suffered this misfortune, there is a tree, in the toppe whereof they set vp a crosse, and graued this inscription in the barke of

The gouernour therefore hauyng intelligence heereof,<note place="margin">The chiefe citie of the supposed continent.</note> sent with all speede two shippes of warre well furnished, to the ayde of them that were left: but they were wyse to late. Yet folowing the viewe of the crosse, they came to the shore, and red the letters grauen on the tree, but durst not attempt fortune. Thus with all theyr hardie souldiers departyng from hence with dispayre, they sayled to the nexte Ilande, out of the whiche they caryed away by violence fyue hundred men and women, supposyng lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse that they myght lawfully so doe, bycause they were Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters and circumcised: But the lyke chaunce happened vnto them when they landed at <hi>Eernandina.</hi> For the Barbarians,<note place="margin">The Spany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes are slaine againe with their owne weapons.</note> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spying oportunitie, set vppon the Spanyardes in one of the shyppes with theyr owne weapons, and slue theyr keepers: the residue that escaped, castyng them selues into the sea, swamme to the next Carauell, and with theyr felowes assayled the Carauell that was taken from them. This conflicte was so sharpe, that for the space of foure houres, it was doubtfull whether parte should obteyne the victorie. The Barbarians both men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men fought very fiercely, aswell to recouer their libertie, as also to holde fast the praye which they had gotten: But in fine, the Spanyardes had the vpper hande, by reason they were more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perte in handlyng of theyr weapons, &amp; rulyng of their Carauell.

They founde but a fewe of thinhabitauntes, and onely one woman in theyr company. By thinterpretours of <hi>Cuba,</hi> and other which the Spaniardes tooke first from <hi>Iucatana,</hi> they perswaded the woman to call the kynges that were absent. They came gladly, and made a league of friendshyp with our men, whereby they were restored to theyr houses, and a great parte of their stuffe.

They erected also an other great crosse of wood in the toppe of the temple, whyther they oftentymes resorte togeather to honour the Image of the virgine. Thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitauntes signifyed by thinterpretours, that in the Ilande of <hi>Iucatana,</hi> not farre from them, there were seuen Christians cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, which in tyme past were driuen thither by tempest.

And heere it shall not bee greatly from my purpose, briefely to rehearse howe the thing chaunced. In my Decades I haue made mention of a certayne noble man named <hi>Valdiuia,</hi> whom the Spanyardes which inhabited <hi>Darie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> in the supposed continent of the gulf of <hi>Vraba,</hi>

Unhappy <hi>Valdiuia</hi> therefore, takyng this matter in hande in an euyll houre,<note place="margin">The shipwrack of Valdiuia.</note> was with a sodeine and violent whirle wynde dryuen vppon certayne quickesandes, in the prospecte of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande of <hi>Iamaica,</hi> lying on the South syde of <hi>Hispaniola</hi> and <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba.</hi> These blynde and swalowyng sandes, the Spaniardes call vypers, and that by good reason, bycause in them many shyppes are entangled,<note place="margin">The quicke sandes called vypers.</note> as the Lisertes are implycate in the tayles of the vypers. While the Carauell thus wresteled with the water, it was so burst in sunder, that <hi>Valdiuia</hi> with thirtie of his felowes could scarcely with much difficultie discende into the shyp boate: where without ores, and without sayles, they were caryed away by the violence of the water. For (as we haue sayd before in our Decades) the seas doe runne there continually with a violent course toward the West.

But to returne to our purpose. When <hi>Aquillaris</hi> had now receyued the gouernours letter, sent by the Cozumellane messengers, hee declared to the kyng his maister (whose name was <hi>Taxmarus</hi>) what was theyr errande thither,<note place="margin">Kyng Tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marus.</note> and wherefore they were sent: vsyng in the meane tyme many large discourses, in expressyng the great power and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence of theyr kyng, who had of late arryued in those coastes: also of theyr humanitie and gentlenesse towarde theyr friendes and such as submitted them selues to them, &amp; againe their rigour and fiercenesse agaynst suche as stubbernly eyther contemned them, or denyed their requestes. With these wordes he brought <hi>Taxmarus</hi> into such feare, that the maister was now fayne to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syre his seruaunt so to handle the matter, that they myght quietly enter into his dominion as his friendes, and not as his enemies. <hi>Aquillaris</hi> promised in their behalfe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they should not onely come in peace, but also to ayde him against his enemies if neede should so require. Whervppon he dismissed <hi>Aquillaris,</hi> &amp; with him three of his familiers and companions. Thus they sayled togeather from <hi>Cozumella</hi> to <hi>Iucatana,</hi> to the ryuer which they had founde before in the fyrst viage thither, by the gouernance of <hi>Alaminus</hi> the pilot.<note place="margin">The mouth of a ryuer stopped with sande.</note> They founde the mouth of the ryuer stopped with sand, as we reade of the ryuer of <hi>Nilus</hi> in Egypte, when the wyndes (called <hi>Etesti</hi>) blow in summer, and especially in the canicular dayes.

But when they perceyued that our men made no hast away, immediately there came a great company of armed men towarde them, demaundyng what they had to do thus to wander in other mens landes. Our men made answeare by <hi>Aquillaris,</hi> that they desyred peace, vittayles, and golde, for exchange of other thynges. They answeared againe, that they woulde nother peace nor warre with them, but threatned them to auoyde the land, except they would be destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed euery man. Our men sayd that they woulde not depart, without sufficient vittayles to mayntayne their souldyers. They appoynted the day folowyng to bryng them more vittayles, but they broke promise: Yet perceyuing the seconde day that our men were encamped on the sande, and had reposed there that nyght, they brought them as much more vittayles, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded them in the name of theyr kyng to departe. Our men sayde that they were desyrous to see the towne, and to haue yet more store of vittayles. The Barbarians denyed theyr request, and therewith departed, whisperyng and mutteryng among them selues.

The houses are diuided with gardens, and are buylded of lyme and stone, very artificiall, and of cunnyng woorkemanship.

Foure of our Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niardes went into one of them, of such greatnesse, that they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in the same for the space of foure houres before they coulde fynde the way out.

The people of this nation is of browne or yelow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yshe colour. Both the men and the women haue pendauntes of gold &amp; pretious stones hanging at their eares: The men also bore theyr neather lippes full of holes, from the vppermost part of the lippe,<note place="margin">They weare rynges and plates at theyr lyppes.</note> euen vnto the neathermost part of the gumme.

At the biggest hole in the middest of the lippe, there hangeth a rounde plate of syluer, as brode as the coyne called a Carolyne, &amp; as thicke as a mans finger.

These procuratours therefore of the newe colonie of the prouince of <hi>Coluacana,</hi> among other their presentes, brought also a great number of bookes, the leaues whereof are made of the inner ryndes or barkes of trees, thinner then eyther that of the Elme or of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Salowe: these they smeere or anoynt with the pitche of molten <hi>Bitumem,</hi> and whyle they be soft, extend them to what fourme them lysteth: When they bee cold and harde, they rubbe them ouer with a certayne playster. It is to be thought, that they beate the playster into fyne floure, and so temperyng it with some byndyng moysture, to make a crust therewith vppon the leaues, whereon they wryte with anye sharpe instrument, and blot the same agayne with a spunge or some suche other thyng, as marchaunt men and noble mens stewards are accustomed to do with their wryting tables made of the woodde of figge trees. The leaues of theyr bookes are not set in order after the maner of ours, but are extended many cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bittes in length. The matters whiche they write, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned in square tables, not lose, but so bound togeather with the tough &amp; flexible clay called <hi>Bitumem,</hi> that they seeme lyke woodden tables whiche had been vnder the handes of cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng Bookbynders. Which way so euer the booke lieth open, there are two leaues seene, and two sydes wrytten, with as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny lying vnder them, except the booke be vnfoulded in length, For vnder one leafe there are many leaues ioyned togeather. The fourmes of theyr letters are nothyng lyke vnto ours, but are muche more crooked and entangled, lyke vnto fyshhookes,<note place="margin">Theyr letters.</note> knottes, snares, starres, fyles, dyse, and suche other, muche lyke vnto the Egyptian letters, and wrytten in lines lyke vnto ours. Heere and there betweene the lines, are pictured the shapes of men, and diuers beastes, and especyally the Images of kynges, and other noble men: Whereby it is to be thought, that in such bookes, the factes of theyr kinges are conteined,<note place="margin">What is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned in theyr bookes.</note> as we see the lyke among vs, how our printers expresse the summe

The coueringes of theyr bookes are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so artificially wrought, and paynted. When they are shut, they seeme to differ nothing from ours in fourme.

They begyn the yeere from the goyng downe of the seauen starres, called <hi>Vergiliae,</hi> or <hi>Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iades,</hi> and count theyr monethes accordyng to the mones. They name a moneth, <hi>Tona,</hi> of the Moone, for in theyr language they call the Moone <hi>Tona.</hi> They recken the dayes by the sonnes: therefore as many dayes as they name, they saye, so manye sonnes, the Sonne in theyr tongue, is called <hi>Tonatico.</hi> They distribute the yeere (without any reason why) into twentie mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethes,<note place="margin">Temples richely adour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> and the moneth into as many dayes.

Our men perceyuyng his earnestnesse heerein, thought it best to choose the least euyll, perceyuyng that it was yet no tyme to disquiet theyr myndes, and therefore suffered them to exercyse their accustomed ceremonies. And although theyr priestes promise them immortall glorie, eternall felicitie, and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall conuersation with the goddes after the stormie dayes of this lyfe, yet doe they with heauy countenaunces giue eare to their promises, and had rather bee set at libertie.

And forasmuche as I am one of thorder and company of them that are appoynted to returne into these regions to serue your maiestie, if therefore the thinges contey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in this booke shall not be distincte in suche order as I promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to perfourme in my greater woorke, I desyre your maiestie to haue no respect herevnto, but rather to consider the noueltie of such straunge thinges as I haue herein declared, whiche is the chiefe ende that moued mee to wryte: Protestyng, that in this Summarie I haue written the trueth of suche thinges as came to my remembraunce, whereof not onely I my selfe can testifie, but also dyuers other worthy and credible men, which haue been in those regions, and are now present in your maiesties courte. And thus it shall suffyse to haue sayde thus much vnto your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, in maner of a proheme vnto this present worke, whiche I most humbly desyre your maiestie as thankefully to accept, as I haue written it faythfully.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He nauigation which is commonly made from Spayne to the west <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> is from <hi>Siuile,</hi> where your maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie haue your house of contraction for those partes, with also your offy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers therevnto parteynyng, of whom the captaynes take theyr passeporte and lycence. The patrones of suche shippes as are appoynted to these vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, imbarke them selues at <hi>San Luca di Barameda,</hi> where the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <hi>Cuadalchiber</hi> entreth into the Ocean sea, and from hence they folow their course toward the Ilands of Canarie. Of these seuen Ilandes, they commonly touche two, that is, eyther <hi>Grancanaria</hi> or <hi>Gomera:</hi> and here the shyppes are furnyshed with freshe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, fuell, cheese, beefe, and suche other thinges, which may seeme requisite to bee added to suche as they bryng with them out of Spayne. From Spayne to these Ilandes, is commonly eyght dayes sayling, or little more or lesse, and when they are arryued there, they haue sayled two hundred and fyftie leagues, whiche make a thousand myles, accompting foure myles to a league, as is their maner to recken by sea. Departing from the sayd Ilands to folow their course, the shyppes tary .xxv. dayes, or a litle more or lesse, before they see the fyrst lande of the Ilandes that lye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that whiche they call <hi>La Spagnuola</hi> or <hi>Hispaniola,</hi> and the lande that is commonly fyrst seene, is one of these Ilandes which they call <hi>Ogni sancti Marigalante</hi> (or <hi>Galanta) La Desseada</hi> (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise called <hi>Desiderata) Matanino, Dominica, Guadalupea, San Christoual,</hi> or some other of the Ilandes, wherof there are a great multitude lying about these aforesayde. Yet it sometymes so chaunceth, that the shyppes passe without the sight of any of the sayd Ilandes, or any other that are within that course, vntill they come to the Ilande of <hi>Sancti Iohannis,</hi> or <hi>Hispaniola,</hi> or <hi>Iamaica,</hi> or <hi>Cuba,</hi> which are before the other. It may also chaunce that they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerpasse all these lykewyse, vntyll they fall vppon the coastes
<pb facs="tcp:22913:198"/>
of the firme lande. But this chaunceth when the pilot is not well practised in this nauigation, or not perfect in the true carde. But makyng this viage with experte maryners (whereof there is nowe great plentie) one of the sayde fyrst Ilandes shall euer bee knowen. And from the Ilandes of Canarie to one of the fyrst of these, the distaunce is niene hundred leagues by sayling, or more, and from hence to the citie of sainct Dominike, which is in the Iland of <hi>Hispaniola,</hi> is a hundred and fyftie leagues: so that from Spayne hitherto, is a thousande and three hundred leagues. Yet forasmuche as sometymes the nauigation proceedeth not so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, but that it chaunceth to wander euer on the one syde or on the other, we may well say that they haue now sayled a thousand and fyue hundred leagues, and more. And if the nauigation bee slow, by reason of some hynderaunce, it commonly chaunceth to be fynished in xxxv. or .xl. dayes: and this happeneth for the most parte, not accomptyng the extremes, that is, eyther of them that haue slowe passage, or of them that arryue in very short tyme: for we ought to consyder that which chaunceth most commonly. The returne from those partes to Spayne, is not fynished with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out longer tyme, as in the space of fiftie dayes, or a litle more or lesse. Neuerthelesse in this present yeere of .1525. there came foure shyppes from the Ilande of <hi>San Dominico,</hi> to sainct <hi>Luca</hi> in Spayne, in .xxv. dayes: But (as I haue sayde) we ought not to iudge of that which chaunceth seldome , but of that which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth most ordinarily. This nauigation is very safe, and much vsed, euen vnto the sayde Iland. And from this to the firme land, the shyppes trauerse diuers wayes for the space of fyue, sixe, or seuen dayes saylyng, or more, accordyng to the partes or coastes whither they directe theyr viages, forasmuch as the sayde fyrme lande is very great and large, and many nauigations and viages are directed to dyuers partes of the same: Yet to the firme land, which is nearest to this Ilande, and lyeth directly agaynst <hi>San Dominico,</hi> the passage is finished in the tyme aforesayde. But it shalbe much better to remit all this to the carde of these nauiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the new Cosmographie, of the whiche no parte was knowne to Ptolome, or any other of the olde wryters.</p>

Whereof, the one is the shortnesse of the way, &amp; with what expedition your maiesties shyppes may passe beyonde the mayne firme lande of these Indies, into the new South sea, called <hi>Mare del Sur,</hi> lying beyond the same, &amp; this to thintent to come to the Ilandes where the spices grow, beside the other innumerable rychesse of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes &amp; seigniories which confine with the said sea, where are so many people &amp; nations of dyuers tongues &amp; maners. The other thing, is to consider howe innumerable treasures are entred into Spayne by these Indies, aswell that which commeth dayly from thence, as also that is continually to be looked for, both of gold &amp; pearle, &amp; other marchaundies, which are first brought into this your realme of Spayne before they are seene of other nations, or traded into other realmes: Whereby not onely this your realme is greatly inriched, but also the benefite thereof redoundeth to the great profite of other countreys which are neare therevnto. A te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie of this, are the double ducades which your maiestie haue caused to bee coyned, and are dispearsed throughout the whole worlde: But after they are once passed out of this your realme, they neuer returne againe, because they are the best currant mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of the worlde. And therefore, if after they haue been in the handes of straungers, they chaunce to bee returned agayne into Spayne, they come disguised in an other habite, and are dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed of the goodnesse of theyr golde, with the stampe of your maiestie chaunged: So that if it were not for theyr suche de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facynges in other realmes for the cause aforesayde, there should not bee founde so great quantitie of fyne golde of the coyne

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His particuler of the mynes of gold, is a thing greatly to bee noted, and I may much better speake hereof the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any other man, forasmuch as there are nowe .xii. yeeres past since I serued in the place of the surueier of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> melting shops partey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the gold mynes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firme land, and was the gouernour of the mynes of the Catholike kyng <hi>Don Ferdinando,</hi> after whose departure from this lyfe, I serued long in the same roome in the name of your maiestie: By reason wherof, I haue had great occasion to know how gold is found and wrought out of the mynes, and doe know ryght well y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this land is exceeding rych, hauing by my accompt, and by the labour of my Indians &amp; slaues, geathered and fyned a great portion of the same, &amp; may therfore the better affyrme this by testimony of sight. For I am well assured, that in no part of <hi>Castilia del oro,</hi> that is, golden Castile (otherwise called <hi>Beragua</hi>) no man coulde aske mee of the mynes of golde, but that I durst haue bounde my selfe to haue discouered them in the space of ten leagues of the countrey where it should haue been demaunded me, and the same to be very rych: for I was alowed all maner of charges to make search for the same. And although gold be found in maner euery where in these regions of golden Castile, yet ought we not in euery place to bestow the trauel &amp; charge to geat it out, because it is of lesse quantitie and goodnesse in some place then in some. And the myne or veyne which ought to be folowed, ought to be in a place which may stand to saue much of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> charges of the labourers, and for the administration of other necessary thinges, that the charges may be recompenced with gaynes: for there is no doubt but that gold shalbe found more or lesse in euery place. And the golde whiche is founde in golden Castile, is very good, &amp; of .xxii. caractes or better in fynesse. Furthermore, besyde this great quantitie of gold, which I haue sayd to be found in the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:22913:199"/>
mynes, there is also from day to day found, or otherwyse gotton, great treasure of such wrought gold as hath ben in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> custodie of the subdued Indians &amp; theyr kynges, aswel of such as they haue geuen for theyr fyne and raunsome, or otherwyse, as frendes to the Christians, besyde that whiche hath ben violently taken from the rebelles: but the greatest parte of the wrought golde whiche the Indians haue, is base, and holdeth somewhat of copper, of this they make braslettes and chaynes, and in the same they close theyr iewels whiche theyr women are accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to weare, &amp; esteemed more then al the richesse of the worlde. The maner howe golde is geathered, is this, eyther of suche as is founde in <hi>Zauana,</hi> that is to saye in the playnes and ryuers of the champion countrey beyng without trees, whether the earth be with grasse or without, or of suche as is sometymes founde on the land without the ryuers in places where trees growe, so that to come by the same, it shalbe requisite to cut downe many and great trees. But after which so euer of these two maners it be founde, eyther in the ryuers or breaches of waters, or els in the earth, I wyl shewe howe it is founde in both these places, and howe it is separate and pourged. Therefore when the myne or veyne is discouered, this chaunceth by searchyng and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng in such places as by certaine signes and tokens do appeare to skylful men apte for the generation of golde, and to holde golde: and when they haue found it, they folowe the myne, and labour it, whether it be in the ryuer, or in the playne, as I haue sayde. And if it be founde on the playne, fyrst they make the place very cleane where they entende to dygge, then they dygge eyght or tenne foote in length, and as muche in breadth: but they goe no deeper then a spanne or two, or more, as shal seeme best to the maister of the myne, dyggyng equally, then they washe all the earth whiche they haue taken out of the sayde space, and if herein they fynde any golde, they folowe it, and if not, they dygge a spanne deeper, and washe the earth as they dyd before: and if then also they fynde nothyng, they continue in diggyng and washyng y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth as before, vntyl they come to the harde rocke or stone: and if in fine they fynde no golde there, they folowe no further to seeke golde in that place, but goe to an other part. And it is to be vnderstoode, that when they haue
<pb facs="tcp:22913:200"/>
founde the myne, they folowe it in dyggyng, in the same mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in leuell and deapth, vntyll they haue made an ende of all the myne whiche that place conteyneth, if it appeare to be riche. This myne ought to consyst of certayne feete or pases in length or breadth, accordyng to certayne orders determined, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that compasse of earth, it is not lawefull for any other to digge for golde: And where as endeth the myne of hym that fyrste founde the golde, immediatly it is lawfull for any other man that wyll, with a staffe to assigne hym selfe a place by the syde of the same, inclosing it with stakes or pales as his owne. These mines of <hi>Zauana</hi> (that is, such as are found in the plaines) ought euer to be sought neare to some ryuer or brooke, or spring of water, or dyke, or standyng poole, to thende that the golde may be washed, for the which purpose they vse the labour of certayne Indians, as they do other in dyggyng of the myne. And when they haue dygged out the myne, they fyll certayne trayes with that earth, whiche other Indians haue the charge immediatly to receyue at theyr handes, and to cary those trayes of earth to the water, where it may bee washed: Yet do not they that bryng it, washe it, but delyuer it to other, puttyng it out of theyr owne trayes into theyrs, whiche they haue redy in theyr handes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue it. These washers for the most part are the Indian wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, because this woorke is of lesse paine and traueyle then any other. These women when they washe, are accustomed to syt by the water syde, with theyr legges in the water euen vp to the knees, or lesse, as the place serueth theyr purpose: and thus hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng the trayes with earth in theyr handes by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> handles thereof, and puttyng the same into the water, they moue them rounde about, after the maner of syftyng, with a certayne aptnesse, in suche sorte that there entreth no more water into the trays then serueth theyr turne, and with the selfe same apte mouyng of theyr trays in the water, they euer auoyde the foule water with the earth out of the one syde of the vessell, and receyue in cleane water on the other syde thereof, so that by this meanes by litle and litle, the water washeth the earth as the lyghter substaunce of the trays, and the golde as the heauyer mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter resteth in the bottome of the same, beyng rounde and holowe in the myddest lyke vnto a barbars basen: And when
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:22913:200"/>
all the earth is auoyded, and the gold geathered togeather in the bottome of the tray, they put it a part, and returne to take more earth, whiche they washe contynually as before. And thus they that labour in this woorke, do geather dayly suche portion of golde as shall please God to graunt to the Patrones of these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, and suche other as trauayle in the same. Furthermore it is to be noted, that for euery two Indians that washe, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite that two other serue them to bryng earth from the myne, and other two to breake the same small, and fyl theyr trayes ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. Also besyde these labourers, it is necessarye that there be other people in the place where they woorke &amp; rest in the night: these are suche as make theyr bread, and prouide for victuals, and other necessaries. So that to conclude, there are in al, fyue persons ordinarilie assigned to euery tray of washers. There is an other manner of workyng the mynes, in ryuers or brookes of runnyng waters: and this is, that in auoydyng the water of his course, after that the beddes of the ryuers are drye and vtterly emptied, they fynde golde among the breaches, clyftes, and ryftes of stones, and among all that is in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the chanell, and where naturally the ryuer runneth of greatest force: So that it chaunceth sometyme, that when the bedde of the ryuer is good and ryche, they fynde in it great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of gold. And therfore your Maiestie ought to vnderstand for a general rule, as it appeareth in fact, that all golde is engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in the toppes and hyghest places of the mountaynes, and in continuance of tyme is by litle and litle brought downe to the vales and playnes by shewres of rayne, and the falles of sprynges, ryuers, and brookes, hauyng theyr originall in the mountaynes, and discending from the same, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng it is oftentymes founde in the playnes farre from the mountaynes. But when it chaunceth to be founde in great quantitie, it is for the most part among the mountaynes, and in the ryuers, or theyr braunches, more then in any other part of the playne: and in these two maners it is commoly founde most abundantly. And for the better proofe that golde is engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred on hygh, and is brought downe into the lowe places, I haue one great token therof, whiche causeth me to beleeue it for certayne: and this is, to consyder that coles neuer putrifie nor
<pb facs="tcp:22913:201"/>
corrupt vnder the grounde, if they be made of strong woodde. Wherby it chaunceth, that dyggyng the earth by the fouldes or indented places of the mountaynes, or on the sydes, &amp; breakyng a myne in the earth where it had been broken before, and hauing nowe dygged one or two or three Poles in measure, the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners founde certayne coles of wood vnder the same leuel where they founde golde, and this I say in the earth whiche was taken for a Uirgin, that is to saye, such as had not before been opened for any myne: the whiche coles coulde not naturally be engendred there, or enter in by any meanes, but when the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitiall part of the earth was equal with the leuel where the coles were founde, it is like that the coles were left there by some occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of fyre, and that they fastened there in tyme, and that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde in long continuance of tyme, they were by litle and litle couered with the earth, whiche the often shewres of rayne wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the mountaynes, so that by the course of yeeres the earth ouergrewe the coles vnto the sayd leuell &amp; measure, which had before tyme been the superfitial part of the earth, where the coles and golde were found togeather: whereby it may appeare that the golde was no more engendred there then were the coles, but brought thyther from the mountaynes by the falles of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as we haue sayd, forasmuch as the mountaynes are the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trices and bowels of all ryche metals. Further and besyde this, I say that in howe muche more the golde is gone farre from the naturall place of his generation to the place where it is founde, it is so much the more purified and fined, and of a better caract, and the nearer that it is founde to his proper myne or veyne where it is engendred, it is so much the baser, fouler, and more crude, and of a baser alay and caract, and doth wast so muche the more in meltyng, and remayneth more brickle. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes there are founde graines of golde of great quantitie, and of great weyght aboue the earth, and sometymes also vnder the earth: And the greatest of all other that was founde to this day in the Indies, was that whiche was lost in the sea about the Ilande <hi>Beata,</hi> whiche weyghed three thousande and two hundred Castellans of gold, which are in value foure thousand a hundred thyrtie and eyght ducades of golde, whiche weigh one <hi>Arroua</hi> and seuen pounde, or thyrtie and two pounde, after twelue oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:22913:201"/>
to the pounde,<note place="margin">A marke, is a pounde of viii. ounces summa .xvi.li. weyght .viii. ounces, after xii. ounces to the .li.</note> whiche make threescore and foure markes of golde. And I sawe in the yeere .1515. in the handes of <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel Passamonte</hi> treasurer to your maiestie, two graines, of the whiche one wayed seuen poundes, which are .xiiii. markes, and are in value about threescore and fyue ducades of golde euery marke: the other was of .x. markes, whiche are fyue poundes of lyke value, and of very good golde of .xxii. caractes, and better: There are also founde many other great graynes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not equall vnto these in bygnesse. And forasmuch as I haue spoken of gold, I haue thought good to declare somewhat howe the Indians can very excellently gylte suche vesselles of copper and base golde as they make: for they can geue them so fayre and floryshyng a coloure, that al the masse which they gylt, appeareth as though it were golde of .xxii. caractes, and better. This colour they geue with a certayne hearbe, as though it were wrought by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> art of any goldsmith of Spayne or Italie, and woulde of them bee esteemed as a thyng of great ryches, and a secrete maner of gyldyng. And for as muche as I haue spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken sufficiently of the mynes of golde, I wyl nowe speake somewhat of copper, because I haue made mention thereof. This metal is founde in many of the Ilandes of the Indies, and also in the firme lande, and is founde dayly in great quantitie, holdyng somewhat of golde. But for the desyre that our men haue to golde, they nothyng esteeme the copper, although there myght great commoditie and profyt be had thereby, and also by other metals, whiche they nothyng regarde, except syluer, which is founde abundantly in that parte of the firme lande whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is called newe Spaine. But of this it shal suffise to haue saide thus muche, because I haue more particulerly entreated of these thynges in my generall hystory of India.</p>

These Oysters are of harde fleshe, and not so pleasaunt in eatyng as are ours of Spayne. This Iland of <hi>Cubagua</hi> where this maner of fyshing is exercised, is in the North coaste, and is no bygger then the Ilande of Zeland. Oftentymes the sea increaseth greatly, and much more then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fishers for pearles would, because where as the place is very deepe, a man can not naturally rest at the bottome,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:22913:202"/>
by reason of the abundaunce of ayry substaunce whiche is in hym. as I haue oftentymes prooued. For although he may by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and force discende to the bottome, yet are his feete lyfted vp agayne, so that he can contynue no tyme there: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore where the sea is very deepe, these Indian fyshers vse to tye two great stones about them with a cord, on euery syde one, by the weyght whereof they discende to the bottome, and remayne there vntyll them lysteth to ryse agayne, at whiche tyme they vnlose the stones, and ryse vp at theyr pleasure. But this theyr aptenesse and agilitie in swymmyng, is not the thyng that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth men most to marueyle: but rather to consyder howe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them can stande in the botome of the water for the space of one whole houre, and some more or lesse, accordyng as one is more apt heereunto then an other. An other thyng there is whiche seemeth to me very straunge: and this is, that where as I haue oftentimes demaunded of some of these Lordes of the Indians, yf the place where they are accustomed to fyshe for pearles, beyng but litle and narrowe, wyll not in short tyme be vtterly without Oysters, yf they consume them so fast. They all answered me, that although they be consumed in one part, yet if they goe a fyshyng in an other part, or an other coaste of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande, or at an other contrary wynde, and contynue fyshyng there also vntyll the Oysters be lykewyse consumed, and then returne agayne to the first place, or any other place where they fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed before, and emptied the same in lyke maner, they finde them agayne as full of Oysters as though they had neuer been fyshed. Wherby we may iudge, that these Oysters eyther remoue from one place to an other, as do other fishes,<note place="margin">Of this reade more largely in the decades.</note> or els that they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred and encrease in certaine ordinarie places. This Iland of <hi>Cumana</hi> &amp; <hi>Cubagua,</hi> where they fyshe for these pearles, is in the twelfe degree of the part of the said coast which inclineth toward the North. Likewise pearles are founde and geathered in the South sea, called <hi>Mare del Sur,</hi> &amp; the pearles of this sea are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry big, yet not so big as they of the Iland of pearles, called <hi>de las perlas,</hi> or <hi>Margaritea,</hi> which the Indians cal <hi>Terarequi,</hi> lying in the gulfe of Sainct Michael, where greater pearles are founde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and of greater pryce, then in any other coast of the North sea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

From this Ilande of <hi>Terarequi,</hi> there was brought a pearle of the fashyon of a Peare, weighing thyrtie and one Caractes,<note place="margin">By the compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice, foure granes make a Caract.</note> which <hi>Petrus Arias</hi> had among a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand and so many poundes weyght of other pearles, whiche he had when captayne <hi>Gaspar Morales</hi> (before <hi>Petrus Arias</hi>) pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to the sayde Ilande in the yeere .1515. whiche pearle was of great pryce. From the sayde Ilande also, came a great and very rounde pearle, which I brought out of the sea, this was as bygge as a smal pellet of a Stonebowe, and of the weyght of twentie and syx Caractes: I bought it in the citie of <hi>Panama,</hi> in the sea of <hi>Sur,</hi> and payde for it syx hundred and fyftie tymes the weyght therof of good golde, and had it three yeeres in my custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and after my returne into Spayne, sold it to the Earle of <hi>Nansao</hi> Marquesse of <hi>Zenete,</hi> great Chamberlayne to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, who gaue it to the Marquesse his wyfe, the Lady <hi>Mentia</hi> of <hi>Mendozza.</hi> I thynke veryly that this pearle was the greatest, fayrest, and roundest that hath been seene in those partes. For your maiestie ought to vnderstand, that in the coaste of the sea of <hi>Sur,</hi> there are founde a hundred great pearles rounde after the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shyon of a Peare, to one that is perfectly rounde and great. This Ilande of <hi>Terarequi,</hi> which the Christians call the Ilande of pearles, and other call it the Ilande of Flowres, is founde in the eight degree on the South syde of the fyrme land, in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince of golden Castyle, or <hi>Beragua,</hi> and these are the coasts of the fyrme lande, where pearles are founde euen vnto this day: I vnderstande also that there are pearles founde in the prouince and Ilandes of <hi>Cartagenia.</hi> And since your maiestie appoynted me a gouernour and captayne, I haue made further searche, and am aduertysed that pearles are founde in diuers other places, as about the Ilande of <hi>Codego,</hi> whiche lyeth agaynst the mouth of that port of the Ilande of <hi>Cartagenia,</hi> which the Indians cal <hi>Coro,</hi> the which Ilande and port are on the North syde, in the tenth degree of the coastes of the fyrme lande.</p>

                     <p>Before thinhabitauntes of the Ilande of <hi>Hispaniola</hi> had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the Christian fayth, there was among them a secte of men, whiche liued solitarily in the desartes and woods, &amp; led theyr lyfe in silence and abstinence, more straightly then euer dyd the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers of Pithagoras secte, absteinyng in lyke maner from the eatyng of all thinges that lyue by blood, contented onely with such fruites, hearbes, and rootes, as the desartes and woods my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred vnto them to eate: The professours of this secte were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Piaces.</hi> They gaue them selues to the knowledge of naturall thinges, and vsed certaine secrete magicall operations and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitions, whereby they had familiaritie with spirites, which they allured into theyr owne bodyes at such tymes as they would take vppon them to tell of thinges to come, whiche they dyd in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as foloweth. When any of the kynges had occasion to call any of them out of the desartes for this purpose, theyr custome was to sende them a portion of theyr fyne bread of <hi>Cazabbi</hi> or <hi>Maizium,</hi> and with humble request and suite to desyre them to tell them of suche thinges as they woulde demaunde. After the request graunted, and the place and day appoynted, the <hi>Piaces</hi> commeth, with two of his disciples waytyng on hym, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the one bryngeth with him a vessell of a secrete water, and the other a litle syluer bell. When he commeth to the place, he sitteth downe on a rounde seate made for hym of purpose, where hauyng his disciples, the one standyng on the one hande, and the other on the other, euen in the presence of the kyng and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne of his nobles (for the common people are not admitted to these mysteries) and turnyng his face towarde the desarte, he begynneth his inchauntment, and calleth the spirite with loude voyce by certayne names, whiche no man vnderstandeth but hee and his disciples. After he hath done thus a whyle, if the spirite yet deferre his commyng, hee drynketh of the sayde water, and therewith waxeth hotte and furious, and inuerteth and turneth his inchauntment, and letteth him selfe blood with a thorne, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueilously turmoylyng him selfe, as wee reade of the furious Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>billes, not ceassyng vntyl the spirit be come: who at his comming

entreth into him, and ouerthroweth him, as it were a greyhound should ouerturne a Squerell, then for a space, hee seemeth to lye as though hee were in great payne, or in a rapte, woonderfully tormentyng him selfe, duryng whiche agonie, the other disciple shaketh the siluer bell continually. Thus when the agonie is past, and he lyeth quietly (yet without any sense or feelyng) the kyng, or some other in his stead, demaundeth of him what he desireth to know: and the spirit answereth by the mouth of the rapte <hi>Piaces,</hi> with a directe and perfecte answere to all poyntes: Insomuche that on a tyme certayne Spanyardes beyng present at these my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries with one of the kynges, and in the Spanyshe tounge de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundyng the <hi>Piaces</hi> of their shyppes which they looked for out of Spayne, the spirite answered in the Indian tounge, and tolde them what day and houre the shyppes departed from Spayne, how many they were, and what they brought, without fayling in any poynte. If he be also demaunded of the eclypse of the Sunne or Moone (which they greatly feare and abhorre) he giueth a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect answere, and the lyke of tempestes, famin, plentie, warre or peace, and such other thinges.

But since the Christian fayth hath been dispearsed throughout the Ilande, these deuyllyshe practises haue ceassed, and they of the members of the deuyll, are made the members of Christ by baptisme, forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng the deuyll and his workes, with the vayne curiositie of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syre of knowledge of thinges to come, whereof for the most parte it is better to be ignorant, then with vexation to know that which can not be auoyded.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, in many places of the firme lande, when any of the kynges dye, all his householde seruauntes, aswell women as men whiche haue continually serued him, kyll them selues, beleeuyng as they are taught by the deuyll <hi>Tuyra,</hi> that they whiche kyll them selues when the kyng dyeth, goe with him to heauen, and serue him in the same place and offyce as

they dyd before on the earth whyle hee lyued: and that all that refuse so to doe, when after they dye by theyr naturall death or otherwyse, theyr soules to dye with theyr bodyes, and to bee dissolued into ayre, and become nothyng, as doe the soules of Hogges, Byrdes, Fyshes, or other bruite beastes: and that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the other may enioy the priuiledge of immortalitie for euer, to serue the kyng in heauen. And of this false opinion commeth it, that they which sowe corne, or set rootes for the kynges bread, and geather the same, are accustomed to kyll them selues, that they may enioy this priuiledge in heauen, and for the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, cause a portion of the graine of <hi>Maizium,</hi> and a bundle of <hi>Iucca</hi> (whereof theyr bread is made) to be buryed with them in their graues, that the same may serue them in heauen, if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happes there should lacke seedes to sowe, and therefore they take this with them, to begyn withall, vntil <hi>Tuyra</hi> (who maketh them all these fayre promises) prouyde them of greater quantitie.

And demaundyng the cause here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, of the kyng and the other Indians: they answered, that they that were buryed there, were the labourers of the grounde, and men skylfull in sowyng of seedes, and makyng of bread, and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes to the kynges father, and to the ende that their soules should not dye with theyr bodyes, they slue them selues at the death of the kyng theyr maister, to lyue with hym in heauen, and to the intent that they myght serue him there in the same offyce, they reserued that <hi>Maizium</hi> and <hi>Iucca,</hi> to sowe it in heauen. Wherevnto I aunswered them in this maner, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde howe your <hi>Tuyra</hi> deceyueth you, and howe all that hee teacheth you is false. You see howe in so long a tyme since they are dead, they haue not yet taken away this <hi>Maizium</hi> and <hi>Iucca,</hi>
                        <pb n="195" facs="tcp:22913:205"/>
which is nowe putrified and woorth nothyng, and not lyke to bee sowen in heauen. To this the kyng replyed, saying, in that they haue not taken it away, nor sowen it in heauen, the cause is, that they chaunced to fynde enough there, by reason whereof they had no neede of this. To this errour many thinges were sayd, which seemed of litle force to remoue him from his false opinion, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially any such as at that age are occupyed of the deuyl, whom they paynt of the selfe same fourme and colour, as hee appeareth vnto them in dyuers shapes and fourmes. They make also Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of golde, copper, and wood, to the same similitudes, in terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble shapes, and so variable, as the paynters are accustomed to paynt them at the feete of sainct Michaell tharchangell, or in any other place, where they paynte them of most horrible portiture. Lykewyse when the deuyll greatly intendeth to feare them, hee threatneth to sende them great tempestes, whiche they call <hi>Fura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canas,</hi> or <hi>Haurachanas,</hi> and are so vehement, that they ouerthrow many houses, and great trees. And I haue seene in mountaynes, full of many and great trees, that for the space of three quarters of a league the mountayne hath been subuerted, and the trees o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowen, and plucked out of the earth with the rootes: a thing doubtlesse so fearefull and terrible to beholde, that it may veryly appeare to bee done by the hande of the deuyll. And in this case the Christian men ought to consider with good reason,<note place="margin">Doctrine not worthy for a christian man.</note> that in all places where the holy sacrament is reserued, the sayde tempestes are no more so outragious, or so perilous as they were wont to bee.</p>

                     <p>There are also many rough and hygh mountaynes, with tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate ayre, and pleasaunt, cleare, and moderate nyghtes: of the whiche particularitie the auncient wryters hauyng no certayne knowledge, affirmed the said burnt line or <hi>Torrida zona,</hi> or Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall, to be naturally vnhabitable.

That poynt which of this lande and new parte of the worlde ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth most towarde the East, is the cape of sainct Augustine, which
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:22913:206"/>
is in the eyght degree: So that the sayd gulfe of <hi>Vraba,</hi> is distant from the Equinoctiall lyne, from a hundred &amp; twentie, to a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirtie leagues, and three quarters of a league, after that accompte of .xvii. leagues and a halfe for euery degree from pole to pole: and thus for a litle more or lesse, goeth all the coast. By reason whereof, in the citie of <hi>Sancta Maria Antiqua</hi> in <hi>Dariena,</hi> and in all that course of the foresayde gulfe of <hi>Vraba,</hi> at all tymes of the yeere the dayes and nyghtes are in maner of equall length: and if there bee any difference betweene them by reason of this small distance from the Equinoctiall, it is so litle, that in .xxiiii. houres, makyng a naturall day, it can not bee perceyued but by the iudgement of speculatiue men, and suche as vnderstande the sphere: From hence the North starre is seene very lowe. And when the starres, whiche are called the guardens of the North starre, are vnder the Chariot, it can not be seene, because it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the horizontall. And whereas I haue sayde before that it ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in these regions at certayne ordinarie tymes, it is so in deed: For it is wynter and summer there at contrary tymes to that which is in Spayne, where the greatest colde of frost and rayne is in December and Ianuary, and the greatest heate of sommer about saint Iohns day at Mydsommer, or in the moneth of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: But in golden Castile or <hi>Beragua,</hi> it is contrary, for the som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and tyme of greatest drought &amp; without rayne, is at Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, and a moneth before, and a moneth after, &amp; the tyme when it rayneth most, is about Mydsommer, and a moneth before, and a moneth after. And this season which they call wynter, is not for that it is any colder then, then at any other tyme of the yeere, or hotter at Christmas then at other seasons, the tyme in these regions being euer after one maner: but for that, that, in this tyme whiche they call wynter, the Sunne is hydde from theyr sightes, by reason of cloudes and rayne, more then at other times.

But to lette passe the multitude of thinges whiche are as variable as the power of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is infinite, and to speake of such thinges as come chiefely to my remembraunce, as most worthie to be noted, I will first speake of certayne litle and troublous beastes, which may seeme to bee engendred of nature to molest &amp; vexe men, to shewe them &amp; giue them to vnderstand, how small and vyle a thing may offende and disquiet them, to thende that they may remember the principall end for the which they were created, that is, to know their maker and procurer of their saluation by the way whiche is open to all Christian men, and all other which will open the eyes of theyr vnderstandyng. And although the thinges whereof wee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende nowe to speake, may seeme vyle and litle to be esteemed, yet are they worthy to bee noted and considered, to vnderstande the difference and variable workes of nature. So it is therefore, that whereas in many partes of the firme lande, by the whiche as well the Christians as Indians doe trauayle, there are suche maryshes and waters in the way, that they are fayne to go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out breeches among the hearbes and weedes, by reason whereof, certaine smal beasts or wormes (which they cal <hi>Garapates</hi>) much lyke vnto tykes, cleaue fast to their legges. These wormes are as litle as the pouder of beaten salt, and cleaue so fast, that they can by no meanes bee taken away, except the place bee noynted with oyle: and after that the legges be noynted a whyle with oyle, or the other partes where these litle tykes are fastened, they scrape the place with a knyfe, and so take them away. But the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians whiche haue no oyle, smoke them, and burne them with fyre, and abyde great paynes in takyng them away by this meanes. Of other litle beastes whiche trouble men, and are engendred in theyr heades or other partes of theyr bodyes, I say that the Christian men which trauayle into these partes, haue them but seldome tymes, and that not past one or two, &amp; this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so

When these Indians are infected with this fylthynesse, they dresse and cleanse one an other: And they that exercyse this, are for the most part women, who eate all that they take, and haue herein suche dexteritie by reason of theyr exercise, that our men can not lyghtly attayne therunto. There is also another thyng greatly to be consydered: and this is, howe the Christian men, beyng there cleane from this fyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynesse of India, aswell in theyr heades as the rest of theyr bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes, yet when they returne to come agayne into Europe, and begyn to arryue in that place of the Ocean sea where we sayde before that these lyse dyed and forsoke them, sodenly in theyr re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passyng by the same clyme (as though these lyse had taryed for them in that place) they can by no meanes auoyde them for the space of certayne dayes, although they change theyr shertes two or three times in a day: These lise are at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fyrst as litle as nittes, and growe by litle and litle, vntyl they be of the byggenesse that they are in Spayne.

                        <note place="margin">Vipers.</note> there are many vipers lyke vnto them of Spayne: they that are bytten of them, dye in short space, for fewe lyue to the fourth day, except present remedy. Of these, some are of lesse kynde then other, and haue theyr tayle somewhat rounde, and leape in the ayre to assayle men, and for this cause, some call this kynde of vipers <hi>Tyro</hi>: theyr by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng is most venomous, and for the most parte incurable. One of them chaunced to byte an Indian mayde whiche serued me in my house, to whom I caused the Surgians to mynister theyr ordinary cure, but they coulde do her no good, nor yet geat one droppe of blood out of her, but onely a yelowe water, so that she dyed the thyrde day for lacke of remedy, as the lyke hath chaunced to dyuers other: This mayde was of the age of .xiiii. yeeres, and spake the Spanyshe tongue as if she had been borne in Castyle: she sayde that the viper whiche byt her on the foote, was two spannes long, or litle lesse, and that to byte her, she lept in the ayre for the space of more then syxe pases, as I haue hearde the lyke of other credible persons. I haue also seene in the firme lande a kynde of adders,<note place="margin">Adders.</note> very small, and of seuen or eyght foote long: these are so redde, that in the nyght they appeare lyke burnyng cooles, and in the day seeme as redde as bloodde, these are also venomous, but not so muche as the vipers. There are other muche lesse, and shorter, and blac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker: these come out of the ryuers, and wander sometymes farre on the lande, and are lykewyse venomous. There are also o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther adders of a russet colour: these are somewhat bygger then the viper, and are hurtful and venomous. There are lykewyse an other sort of many colours, and very long: of these I sawe one in the yeere of Christ .1515. in the Iland of <hi>Hispaniola,</hi> neere vnto the sea coastes, at the foote of the mountaynes called <hi>Peder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nales,</hi> when this adder was slayne, I measure her, and founde her to be more then .xx. foote long, &amp; somwhat more then a mans fyst in byggnesse: and although she had three or foure deadly woundes with a swoorde, yet dyed she not, nor stonke the

same daye, insomuche that her blood contynued warme all that tyme. There are also in the Maryshes and desartes of the fyrme lande many other kyndes of Lysartes, Dragons,<note place="margin">Dragons.</note> and other diuers kyndes of Serpentes, whereof I entende not heere to speake muche, because I haue more particulerly entreated of these thynges in my generall historie of the West Indies. There are also Spyders of marueylous byggenesse,<note place="margin">Spiders</note> and I haue seene some with the bodye and legges bygger then a mans hande extended euery waye, and I once sawe one of suche byggenesse, that only her bodye was as bygge as a Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe, and full of that Laune whereof they make theyr webbes: this was of a darke russet coloure, with eyes greater then the eyes of a Sparowe, they are venomous, and of terrible shape to heholde. There are also Scorpions, and dyuers other such venomous wormes. Whereby we may see, that where as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall causes and influence of the planettes are of strongest acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie, they ceasse not to engender and bryng foorth both good and badde, accordyng to the dispotion of the matter, whiche they also doo partly dispose, as the philosophers affyrme. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore in the fyrme lande, there are many Toades, beyng ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry noyous and hurtfull by reason of theyr great multitude, they are not venomous, they are seene in great abundaunce in <hi>Darie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> where they are so bygge that when they dye in the tyme of drouth, the bones of some of them (and especialy the rybbes) are of suche greatnesse, that they appeare to be the bones of Cattes, or of some other beastes of the same byggenesse. But as the waters diminishe, and the moysture consumeth in the tyme of drouth (as I haue sayde) they also consume therewith, vntyl the yeere next folowyng when the rayne and moysture encrease, at whiche tyme they are seene agayne. Neuerthelesse, at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent there is no such quantitie of them, as was wont to be, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that as the lande is better cultured by the Christians, aswell by the fellyng of wooddes and shrubbes, as also by the pasture of Kyne, Horses, and other beastes, so is it apparent that this poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son diminisheth daylye, whereby that region becommeth more holsome and pleasaunt: these Toades syng after three or foure sortes, for some of them syng pleasauntly, other lyke ours of Spayne, some also whystle, and other some make an

other maner of noyse: they are lykewyse of diuers coloures, as some greene, some russet or gray, and some almost blacke, but of all sortes they are great and fylthy, and noyous by reason of theyr great multitude, yet are they not venemous as I haue sayde. There are also a straunge kynde of Crabbes, whiche come foorth of certayne holes of the earth,<note place="margin">Crabbes.</note> that they them selues make: the head and bodie of these make one rounde thyng, muche lyke vnto the hood of a Faulkon, hauyng foure feete commyng out of the one syde, &amp; as many out of the other: they haue also two mouthes, like vnto a payre of small Pinsers, the one bygger then the other, wherewith they byte, but doo no great hurt, because they are not venomous: theyr skynne and bodie is smooth, and thynne, as is the skynne of a man, sauyng that it is somewhat harder, theyr coloure is russet, or whyte, or blewe, and walke sydelong, they are very good to be eaten, insomuche that the Christians trauaylyng by the fyrme lande, haue been greatly nouryshed by them, because they are founde in maner euery where: in shape and fourme they are muche like vnto the Crabbe whiche we paynt for the signe Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, and like vnto those whiche are founde in Spayne in <hi>Anda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusia</hi> in the ryuer <hi>Guadalchiber,</hi> where it entreth into the sea, and in the sea coastes there about, sauyng that these are of the water, and the other of the lande: they are sometymes hurtfull, so that they that eate of them dye, but this chaunceth only when they haue eaten any venomous thyng, or of the venomous apples wherewith the Canible archers poyson theyr arrowes, whereof I wyll speake hereafter, and for this cause the Christians take heede how they eate of these Crabbes, yf they fynde them neare vnto the sayd apple trees. Furthermore in these Indies, aswel in the fyrme lande, as in the Ilandes, there is founde a kynde of Serpentes, whiche they call <hi>.Y.

kynde of smothnesse or barenesse, although of dyuers colours: vpon the rydge of theyr backes, they haue many long prickes, theyr teeth are very sharpe, and especially theyr fanges or dogge teeth, theyr throtes are long and large, reachyng from theyr beardes to theyr breastes, of the lyke skynne to the resydue of theyr bodyes: they are dumbe, and haue no voyce, or make any noyse, or crye, although they bee kept tyed to the foote of a cheste, or any other thyng, for the space of .xx. or .xxv. dayes, without any thyng to eate or drynke, except they geue them nowe and then a litle of the bread of <hi>Cazabbi,</hi> or some suche other thyng: they haue foure feete, and theyr fore feete as long as a mans fynger, with clawes lyke the clawes of a byrde, but weaker, and suche as can not grasple or take holde of any thyng: they are muche better to bee eaten then to beholde, for fewe that see them, wyll haue desyre to eate of them, by reason of theyr horrible shape, except suche as haue ben accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to the beastes of these regions, whiche are more horrible and feareful, as this is not, but onely in apparence: theyr fleshe is of muche better tast then the fleshe of Connies, and more holsome, for it hurteth none but onely suche as haue had the frenche poxe, insomuche that if they haue been touched of that infirmitie, although they haue ben whole of long tyme, neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse they feele hurte, and complayne of the earyng of these <hi>Iuannas,</hi> as hath been oftentimes prooued by experience. There are founde in the fyrme lande certayne byrdes, so litle, that the whole body of one of them is no bygger then the toppe of the byggest fynger of a mans hande, and yet is the bare body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the feathers not halfe so bygge: This byrde, besyde her li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlenesse, is of suche velocitie and swyftnesse in fleeyng, that who so seeth her fleeyng in the ayre, can not see her flap or beate her winges after any other sort then do the Dorres, or humble bees, or Beetels: so that there is no man that seeth her flee, that would thynke her to be any other then a Dorre: they make their nestes accordyng to the proportion of their bygnes, and I haue seene that one of these byrdes with her nest put in a payre of golde weights, altogeather hath waide no more then .2. <hi>Tomini,</hi> which are in poise .24. graines, with the feathers, with out the which she shoulde haue wayed somwhat lesse. And doubtlesse when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider

the fynenesse of the clawes &amp; feete of these byrdes, I knowe not whereunto I may better lyken them, then to the litle byrdes whiche the lymners of bookes are accustomed to paynte on the margent of churche bookes, and other bookes of diuine seruice. Theyr feathers are of many fayre colours, as golden, yelowe, and greene, besyde other variable colours, theyr beake is very long for the proportion of theyr bodies, and as fyne and subtile as a sowyng nedle: they are very hardy, so that when they see a man clime y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tree where they haue their nests, they flee at his face, &amp; stryke hym in the eyes, commyng, goyng, and returnyng with such swyftnes, that no man woulde lyghtly beleeue it, that hath not seene it: and certaynly these byrdes are so litle, that I durst not haue made mention hereof, if it were not that diuers other which haue seene them as wel as I can beare witnes of my say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: they make their nestes of flockes and heare of cotton, wherof there is great plentie in these regions, and serueth wel for theyr purpose. But as touchyng the byrdes, foules, and beastes of these Indies, because they are innumerable, both litle and great, I intende not to speake muche heere, because I haue spoken more largely hereof in my generall hystorye of the Indies. There is an other kynde of beastes seene in the firme lande, whiche seemeth very strange and marueylous to the Christian men to beholde, and much differyng from al other beastes whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che haue ben seene in other partes of the world: these beastes are called <hi>Bardati,</hi> and are foure footed, hauyng their tayle and al the rest of theyr bodyes couered onely with a skynne lyke the coper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a barbed horse, or the checkered skinne of a Lisarte or Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codile, of coloure betwene white and russet, inclynyng somwhat more to whyte.

<pb n="200" facs="tcp:22913:210"/>
are taken with nettes, and some also kylled with Crosbowes: they are likewise taken oftentymes when the husbandmen burne the stubble in sowyng tyme, or to renue the herbage for Kyne and other beastes. I haue oftentymes eaten of theyr flesh, which seemeth to me of better tast then Kyddes fleshe, and holsome to be eaten. And if these beastes had euer been seene in these partes of the worlde, where the fyrst barbed horses had theyr originall, no man woulde iudge but that the fourme and fashyon of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perture of horses furnyshed for the warres, was fyrst deuised by the syght of these beastes. There is also in the fyrme lande an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beast, called <hi>Orso Formigaro,</hi> that is, the Ante beare.

For in these regions is engendred a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne kynde of Antes, very litle and blacke, in the feeldes and playnes where as growe no trees,<note place="margin">Antes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </note> where by the instinct of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture these Antes separate them selues to engender farre from the wooddes for feare of these Beares, the which because they are fearefull, vyle, and vnarmed (as I haue sayde) they keepe euer in places full of trees, vntyll very famine and necessitie, or the great desire that they haue to feede on these Antes, cause them to come out of the woods to hunt for them: these Antes make a hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke of earth to the heyght of a man, or somewhat more or lesse, and as byg as a great chest, &amp; sometymes as byg as a Butte or a Hogshead, &amp; as hard as a stone, so that they seeme as though they were stones, set vp to limit the endes &amp; confines of certaine lands. Within these hillocks, made of most harde earth, are innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable and infinite litle Antes, the whiche may be geathered by bushelles when the hyllocke is broken: the whiche when it is sometymes moysted by rayne, and then dryed agayne by the heate of the Sonne, it breaketh, and hath certayne small ryftes, as litle and subtyle as the edge of a knyfe, and it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that nature hath geuen sense to these Antes to fynde
<pb facs="tcp:22913:211"/>
suche a matter of earth, wherewith they may make the sayde hyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke of suche hardnesse, that it may seeme a strong pauement made of lyme and stone: and whereas I haue proued and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed some of them to be broken, I haue founde them of such hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, as yf I had not seene I could not haue beleeued, insomuch that they coulde scarcely be broken with pykes of Iron, so strong fortresses doo these litle beastes make for theyr sauegard against theyr aduersarie the Beare, who is chiefely nouryshed by them, and geuen them as an enimie, accordyng to the common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe whiche sayeth, <hi>Non e alcuna persona si libera, a chimanchi il suo Bargello,</hi> that is, there is no man so free, that hath not his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutor or priuie enimie. And here when I consyder the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueilous prouidence whiche nature hath geuen to these litle bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, I cal to remembrance the wittie sentence of Plinie, where speakyng of such litle beastes, he sayeth thus, Why do we mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueile at the Towrebearyng shoulders of Elephantes, and not rather where nature hath placed so many senses &amp; such industrye in such litle bodies? Where is hearing, smelling, seeing, and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng, yea, where are the vaynes and arteries (without which no beast can lyue or moue) in these so litle bodies, whereof some are so small that theyr whole bodies can scarsly be seene of our eyes: What shall we then saye of the partes of the same? Yet euen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong these there are many of such sagasitie and industry, as the like is not seene in beastes of greater quantitie, no nor yet in man. &amp;c. But to returne to the history. This enimie whiche na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath geuen to these litle beastes, vseth this maner to assayle them: When he resorteth to the hyllocke where the Antes lie hid as in theyr fortresse, he putteth his tongue to one of the ryftes whereof we haue spoken, being as subtile as the edge of a sword, and therewith contynuall lickyng, maketh the place moyst, the fome and froth of his mouth beyng of suche propertie, that by contynuall lickyng the place, it enlargeth the ryft in such sort by litle and litle, that at the length he easely putteth in his tongue, whiche he hath very long and thynne, and muche disproportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to his bodie, and when he hath thus made free passage for his tongue into the hyllocke, to put it easely in and out at his pleasure, then he thrusteth it into the hole as farre as he can reache, and so letteth it rest a good space, vntyll a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:22913:211"/>
of the Antes (whose nature reioyceth in heate and moyster) haue laden his tongue, and as many as he can conteyne in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lownesse thereof, at which tyme hee sodeynly draweth it into his mouth, and eateth them, and returneth agayne to the same prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise immediatly, vntyll he haue eaten as many as him lysteth, or as long as he can reache any with his tongue. The fleshe of this beast, is filthy and vnsauery, but by reason of the extreme shyftes and necessitie that the Christian men were put to at theyr fyrst commyng into these partes, they were inforced to proue all thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and so fell to the eatyng of these beastes: but when they had found more delycate meates, they fel into hatred with this.

Suche as haue accustomed to drynke in these vesselles, and haue been troubled with the disease called the frettyng of the guttes, say that they haue by experience founde it a marueylous remedie agaynst that disease, and that it breaketh the stone, and prouoketh vrine. This fruite was called <hi>Cocus,</hi> for this cause, that when it is taken from the place where it cleaueth fast to the tree, there are seene two holes, and aboue them two other natural holes, whiche alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather do represent the gesture and figure of the cattes called <hi>Mammoni,</hi> that is, Munkeys, when they crye, which crye the Indians call <hi>Coca,</hi> but in very deede, this tree is a kinde of Date trees, and hath the same effecte to heale frettyng of the guttes, that Plinie descrybeth all kynds of Date trees to haue. There are furthermore in the firme lande, trees of suche byggenesse that I dare not speake therof,<note place="margin">Great trees.</note> but in place where I haue so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wytnesses whiche haue seene the same as well as I. I saye therefore, that a league from <hi>Dariena</hi> or the citie of <hi>Sancta Maria Antiqua,</hi> there passeth a ryuer very large and deepe, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Cuti,</hi> ouer the which the Indians had layde a great tree, so trauersing the same, that it was in the steade of a bridge, the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che I my selfe with dyuers other that are at this present in your maiesties court, haue oftentymes passed ouer. And forasmuche as the said tree had line long there, and by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great weight therof was so shronke downewarde, and partly couered with water, that none coulde passe ouer it, but were wette to the knee, I beyng then in the yeere .1522. the official or Iustice in that citie at your maiesties appoyntment, caused an other great tree to be layde in that place, whiche in lyke maner trauersed the ryuer, and reached more then fyftie foote ouer the further syde: This tree was exceeding great, and rested aboue the water more then two cubytes, in the fall, it cast downe all such other trees as
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:22913:216"/>
were within the reache thereof, and discouered certayne vynes, whiche were so laden with blacke grapes of pleasaunt taste, that they satysfied more then fyftye persons whiche ate theyr fyl there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. This tree in the thyckest part therof, was more then syxteene spannes thycke, and was neuerthelesse but litle in respect of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other trees whiche are founde in this prouince. For the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians of the coaste and prouince of <hi>Cartagenia,</hi> make barkes or boates thereof (which they call <hi>Canoas,</hi>) of suche byggenesse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng all one whole tree, that some conteyne a hundred men, some a hundred and thirtie, and some more, hauyng neuerthelesse such voyde space within the same, that there is left sufficient roome to passe to and fro throughout all the <hi>Canoas.</hi> Some of these are so large, besyde the length, that they conteyne more then ten or twelue spannes in breadth, and sayle with two sayles, as with the maister sayle and the tryncket, which they make of very good cotton. The greatest trees that I haue seene in these partes, or in any other regions, was in the prouince of <hi>Guaturo,</hi> the kyng wherof rebellyng from the obedience of your maiestie, was pursued by me, and taken prisoner: at whiche tyme I with my companye, passed ouer a very hygh mountayne, full of great trees, in the top whereof, we founde one tree, whiche had three rootes, or rather diuisions of the roote aboue the earth, in fourme of a tryangle, or treuet,<note place="margin">A marueylous tree.</note> so that betweene euery foote of this tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle or three feete, there was a space of twentie foote betwene euery foote, and this of such heyght aboue the earth, that a laden Car<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:22913:217"/>
Among certayne Spaniardes whiche clymed this tree, I my selfe was one, and when I was ascended to the place where it begunne to spreade the braunches, it was a marueilous thyng to beholde a great countrey of suche trees towarde the prouince of Abrayme. This tree was easy to clyme, by reason of certayne <hi>Besuchi,</hi> (whereof I haue spoken before) which grew wreathed about the tree, in suche sort that they seemed to make a scalyng Ladder. Euery of the forsayd three feete whiche bore the bodie of the tree, was twentie spannes in thickenesse, and where they ioyned all togeather aboute the Trunke or bodie of the tree, the principall Trunke was more then fourtie and fyue spannes in circuite. I named the mountayne where these trees growe, the mountayne of three footed trees. And this whiche I haue now declared, was seene of all the companie that was there with me when (as I haue sayde before) I tooke kyng <hi>Guaturo</hi> pryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the yeere .1522. Many thynges more myght heere be spoken as touching this matter, as also howe there are many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther excellent trees founde of diuers sortes and dyfference, as sweete Cedar trees, blacke Date trees, and many other, of the whiche some are so heauye that they cannot floote aboue the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but syncke immediatly to the bottome, and other agayne as lyght as a Corke. As touchyng all which thynges I haue writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten more largely in my generall historie of the Indies. And for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuche as at this present I haue entred to entreat of trees, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I passe any further to other thynges, I wyll declare the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner howe the Indians kindle fyre, only with wood and without fire,<note place="margin">Kyndlyng of fyre without fyre.</note> the maner wherof is this. They take a peece of wood, of two spannes in length, as bygge as the least fynger of a mans hand, or as an arrowe well pullyshed, and of a strong kynde of wood which they keepe only for this purpose: and where they entend to kyndle any fire, they take two other peeces of wood, of the dryest and lyghtest that they can fynde, and bynde them fast togeather one with an other, as close as two fyngers ioyned: in the myddest or betweene these, they put the poynt of the fyrst litle staffe made of harde and strong woodde, whiche they hold in theyr handes by the toppe thereof, and turne or rubbe it rounde about contynually in one place betweene the two pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of woodde which lye bounde togeather vppon the earth,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:22913:217"/>
whiche by that vncessant rubbyng and chafyng, are in shorte space kyndeled, and take fyre.<note place="margin">Putrified woodde shy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng in the nyght.</note> I haue also thought good heare to speake somewhat of suche thynges as come to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce of certayne trees whiche are founde in this lande, and sometyme also the lyke haue been seene in Spayne. These are certayne putrifyed trunkes, whiche haue lyne so long rottyng on the earth, that they are very whyte, and shyne in the nyght lyke burnyng fyrebrandes, and when the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyardes fynde any of this woodde, and intende priuily in the nyght to make warre and inuade any prouince, when case so requyreth that it shalbe necessary to goe in the nyght, in such places where they knowe not the way, the formost Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian man whiche guydeth the way, associate with an Indian to directe hym therein, taketh a litle starre of the sayde woodde, whiche he putteth in his cappe, hangyng behynde on his shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, by the lyght whereof he that foloweth next to hym, direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his iourney, who also in lyke maner beareth an other starre behynde hym, by the shynyng whereof the thyrde foloweth the same way, and in lyke maner do al the rest, so that by this meanes none are loste or stragle out of the way. And forasmuch as this lyght is not seene very farre, it is the better policie for the Christians, because they are not therby disclosed before they inuade theyr enimies.

So it is therfore, that in the firme land there are many sorts of reedes, so that in many places they make their houses thereof, coueryng them with the toppes of the same, and makyng theyr walles of them in lyke maner, as I haue sayde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: and among these kyndes of reedes, there is one so great, that the canes therof are as bigge as a mans legge in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knee, and three spanns in length from ioynt to ioynt, or more, insomuch that euery of them is of capacitie to contayne a litle bucket of water. In this kynde, there are founde some greater, and some lesse, of the whiche some they vse to make quyuers for arrowes. There is founde an other kynde, whiche suerly is marueylous, beyng litle bygger then a Iauelyn, the canes whereof are longer then two spannes: these reedes growe one farre from an other, as some tymes twentie or thirtie pases, and sometymes also two or three leagues: they growe in maner in all prouynces in the

Indies, and growe neere to very hyghe trees, whereunto they leane, and creepe vp to the toppes of theyr braunches, whiche they imbrase, and discende agayne downe to the earth. Theyr canes are full of most cleare water, without any maner of tast or sauour, eyther of the canes, or of any other thyng, and suche as yf it were taken out of the freshest spryng in the worlde, nor yet is it knowen that euer it hurt any that drunke therof. For it hath oftentymes so chaunced, that as the Christian men haue tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayled in these regions in desolate wayes, where for lacke of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they haue been in great daunger to die for thirst, they haue es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped that peryl by reason that they founde the sayd reedes, of the water of whose canes they haue drunke a great quantitie, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any hurt thereof ensuing. Therfore when they fynde these in any place, they make water vessels of the canes thereof, and carry as many of them full of water as may suffice for one dayes iorney: and sometime they cary so many, that they take for euery man two or three quartes of water, which may serue them for many dayes, because it doth not corrupt, but remayneth styll freshe and good.</p>
                     <p>There are also certayne plantes, whiche the Christians call <hi>Platani.</hi> These are as hygh as trees, and become as byg in the trunke as the knee of a man, or more.<note place="margin">

In the myddest of this plant, in the highest part therof, there groweth a cluster with fourtie or fyftie platans about it, euery of them beyng a spanne and a halfe in length, and as byg as a mans arme in the small, or more, or lesse, accordyng to the goodnesse of the soyle where they growe: they haue a rynde not very thycke, and easye to be broken, beyng within altogeather ful of a substaunce lyke vnto the mary of the bone of an Oxe, as it appeareth when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rinde or barke is taken from the same. This cluster ought to be taken from the plant, when any one of the platans begin to appeare yelowe, at which tyme they take it, and hang it in theyr houses, where all the cluster waxeth rype, with all his platans. This cluster is a very good fruite, and when it is opened, and the rynde taken

This trunke or spryg which bryngeth foorth the sayd cluster, is a whole yeere in grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and brynging foorth fruite, in which tyme it hath put foorth rounde about it ten or twelue sprygges, as bygge as the fyrst or principall, and multiplieth no lesse then the principall in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing foorth of clusters, with fruites lykewyse at theyr tyme, and also in bryngyng foorth other and many sprygges, as is sayde before. From the whiche sprygges or trunkes, as soone as the cluster of the fruite is taken away, the plant beginneth to drye and wyther, whiche then they take out of the grounde, because it doth none other then occupie it in vayne, and without profyte. They are so many, and do so marueylously encrease and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie, that it is a thyng in maner encredible.

<pb n="212" facs="tcp:22913:222"/>
not be expressed without large wrytyng and long tyme. But to let passe to intreate particulerly of the multitude of fyshes, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende to speake chiefely, and somewhat largely, of three sortes of most notable fyshes: whereof the fyrst is, the great Tortoyses, the seconde is called <hi>Tiburon,</hi> and the thyrd <hi>Manate.</hi> And to begin at the fyrst, I say that in the Ilande of <hi>Cuba,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Great Tortoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</note> are found great Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toyses (which are certayne shell fyshes) of suche byggenesse that tenne or fyfteene men are scarsely able to lyfte one of them out of the water, as I haue been infourmed of credible persons dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng in the same Iland. But of that which I my selfe haue seene, I can testifie, that in the fyrme lande, in the village of <hi>Acla,</hi> there are of this sort some taken and kylled of suche byggenesse, that syxe men with muche difficultie coulde scarsely drawe them out of the water, and commonly the least sort of them are as much as two men may carry at a burden: that whiche I sawe lyfted vp by syxe men, had her shell a yarde and a quarter in length, and in breadth more then fyue yardes. The maner of takyng them, is this: It sometymes chaunceth that in theyr great nettes (whiche they call shoote nettes) there are founde certayne Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toyses of the common sort, in great quantities, and when they come out of the sea, and bryng foorth theyr egges, and goe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather by companyes from the sea, to feede on the lande, the Christians or Indians folowe theyr steppes which they fynde in the sande, and soone ouertake them, because they are very heauy and slowe in goyng, although they make all the hast they can to returne to the sea, assoone as they espie any bodie. When they that pursue them haue ouertaken them, they put a stake or staffe vnder theyr legges, and ouerturne them on theyr backes as they are yet runnyng, so that they can goe no further, nor yet ryse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne or turne, and thus they suffer them to lye styll whyle they folowe after the rest, which they ouerturne in lyke maner: and by this meanes take very many, at suche tymes as they come foorth of the sea as I haue sayde: This fyshe is very excellent and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some to be eaten, and of good tast. The seconde of the three fyshes wherof I haue spoken, is the <hi>Tiburon:</hi> this is a very great fyshe, and very quycke and swyft in the water,<note place="margin">Tiburons.</note> and a cruell de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourer: these are oftentymes taken, aswell when the shippes are vnder sayle in the Ocean, as also when they lye at anker, or at
<pb facs="tcp:22913:223"/>
any other tyme, and especially the leaste kynde of these fyshes. When the shyppes are vnder sayle, the byggest sorte are taken after this maner. When the <hi>Tiburon</hi> seeth the shyppe saylyng, he foloweth it swymmyng behynde, the whiche thinges the mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners seeyng, cast foorth all the fylth of the shyppe into the sea for the fyshe to eate, who neuerthelesse foloweth them with equall pase, although they make neuer suche haste with full wynde and sayles, and waloweth on euery syde and about the shyp, and thus foloweth it sometyme for the space of a hundred &amp; fyftie leagues, and more, and when the mariners are disposed to take them, they cast downe by the sterne of the shyppe a hooke of Iron, as bygge as the byggest fynger of a mans hande, of three spannes in length, and crooked lyke a fyshehooke, with beardes accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng to the bygnesse thereof, and fastened to an Iron cheyne of fyue or syxe lynkes neare vnto the ende, and from thence tyed with a great rope, fastnyng also on the hooke for a bayte, a peece of some fyshe, or hogges fleshe, or some other flesh, or the bowels and intralles of an other <hi>Tiburon</hi> which they haue taken before, whiche may easily be done, for I haue seene niene taken in one day, and if they would haue taken more, they myght also. Thus when the <hi>Tiburon</hi> hath pleasauntly folowed the shyppe a long viage, at the length he swaloweth the bayte with the hooke, and aswell by his stryuyng to flee or escape, as also by the swyft pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of the shyppe, the hooke ouerthwarteth and catcheth holde of his chappes: the whiche fyshe when it is taken, it is of such huge byggenesse, that twelue or fyfteene men are scarsely able to drawe it out of the water, and lyft it into the shyppe, where one of the mariners gyueth it many knockes on the head with a club or beetle, vntyll hee haue slayne it: they are sometymes founde of tenne or twelue foote long, and of fyue, sixe, or seuen spannes in breadth, where they are brodest: they haue very great and wyde mouthes, to the proportion of the rest of theyr bodyes, and haue two rowes of teeth, the one somewhat separate from the other, of cruell shape, and standyng very thycke. When they haue slayne this fyshe, they cut the body thereof in small peeces, and put it to drye, hangyng it three or foure dayes at the cordes of the sayle clothes to drye in the wynde, and then eate it: It is doubtlesse a good fyshe, and of great commoditie to serue
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:22913:223"/>
the shyppes for vitalles for many dayes: the leaste of these fyshes are most holesome and tender, it hath a skynne muche lyke to the skynne of a Sole whereunto the sayd <hi>Tiburon</hi> is like in shape: Whiche I saye, because Plinie hath made mention of none of these three fyshes, among the number of them wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he writeth in his natural hystorie.<note place="margin">Plinie.</note> These <hi>Tiburons</hi> come foorth of the sea, and enter into the ryuers, where they are no lesse perylous then great Lisartes or Crocodiles, wherof I haue spoken largely before: For they deuoure men, kyne, and horses, euen as do the Crocodiles:<note place="margin">Crocodiles.</note> they are very daungerous in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne washyng places or pooles by the ryuers sydes, and where they haue deuoured at other tymes. Dyuers other fyshes both great and small, of sundry sortes and kyndes, are accustomed to folowe the shyppes goyng vnder sayle, of the whiche I wyll speake somwhat when I haue written of <hi>Manate,</hi> whiche is the thyrde of the three wherof I haue promised to entreate.<note place="margin">Manates.</note> 
                        <hi>Manate</hi> therefore, is a fyshe of the sea, of the byggest sorte, and muche greater then the <hi>Tiburon</hi> in length and breadth, and is very bruityshe and vyle, so that it appeareth in fourme lyke vnto one of those great vesselles made of goates skynnes, wherin they vse to cary newe wyne in <hi>Medina de Campo,</hi> or in <hi>Areualo</hi>: the head of this beast is lyke the head of an Oxe, with also like eyes, and hath in the place of armes, two great stumpes wherwith he swymmeth: It is a very gentle and tame beast, and commeth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes out of the water to the next shore, where if he fynd any hearbes or grasse, he feedeth therof. Our men are accustomed to kyl many of these, and diuers other good fyshes, with their cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowes, pursuing them in barkes or Canoas, because they swim in maner aboue the water: the which thyng when they see, they drawe them with a hooke tyde at a small corde, but somewhat strong: As the fyshe fleeth away, the archer letteth go, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth the corde by litle and litle, vntyll he haue let it go many fathams: at the ende of the corde, there is tyde a corke, or a peece of lyght woodde, and when the fyshe is gone a litle way, and hath coloured the water with his blood, and feeleth hym selfe to faynt and drawe towarde the ende of his lyfe, he resor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to the shore, and the archer foloweth, geatheryng vp his corde, wherof whyle there yet remayne syxe or eyght fathams, or
<pb facs="tcp:22913:224"/>
somewhat more or lesse, he draweth it towarde the lande, and draweth the fyshe therewith by litle and litle, as the waues of the sea helpe hym to do it the more easly: then, with the helpe of the rest of his companie, he lyfteth this great beaste out of the water to the lande, beyng of suche byggenesse, that to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey it from thence to the citie, it shalbe requisite to haue a carte with a good yoke of Oxen, and sometymes more, accordyng as these fyshes are of byggenesse, some being much greater then other some in the same kinde, as is seene of other beastes: Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes they lyft these fyshes into the Canoa or barke, without drawyng them to the lande as before, for as soone as they are slayne, they flote aboue the water: And I beleeue veryly that this fyshe is one of the best in the worlde to the tast, and the lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est vnto fleshe, especially so lyke vnto beefe, that who so hath not seene it whole, can iudge it to be none other when he seeth it in peeces then very beefe or veale, and is certaynly so lyke vnto fleshe, that all the men in the world may herein be deceyued: the tast likewise, is like vnto the tast of very good veale, and lasteth long, yf it be powdred: so that in fine, the Base of these parts, is by no meanes lyke vnto this.<note place="margin">The fyshe Manate.</note> This <hi>Manate</hi> hath a certayne stone, or rather bone in his head within the brayne, whiche is of qualitie greatly appropriate agaynst the disease of the stone, if it be burnt and grounde into small powder, and taken fastyng in the morning when the paine is felte,<note place="margin">A remedy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst the stone.</note> in such quantitie as may lye vppon a peny, with a draught of good whyte wyne: For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus taken three or foure mornings, it acquieteth the greefe, as dyuers haue tolde me whiche haue proued it true, and I my selfe by testimonie of syght, do wytnesse that I haue seene this stone sought of dyuers for this effecte.</p>
                     <p>There are also dyuers other fyshes as bygge as this <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,</hi> among the whiche there is one called <hi>Vihuella.</hi> This fyshe beareth in the toppe of his head a swoorde,<note place="margin">The swoorde fyshe.</note> beyng on euery syde full of many sharpe teeth, this swoorde is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally very harde and strong, of foure or fyue spannes in length, and of proportion accordyng to the same byggenesse: and for this cause is this fyshe called <hi>Spada,</hi> that is, the swoorde fyshe. Of this kynde some are founde as litle as Sardines, and other so great, that two yokes of Oxen are scarsely able to drawe

them on a Cart. But whereas before I haue promised to speake of other fyshes, whiche are taken in these seas whyle the shyppes are vnder sayle, I wyll not forgeat to speake of the Tunnye, whiche is a great and good fyshe,<note place="margin">Tunnye.</note> and is oftentymes taken and kylde with trout speares, and hookes, cast in the water, when they play and swym about the shyppes. In lyke maner also are taken many Turbuts, whiche are very good fyshes as are lyghtly in all the sea. And here is to be noted,<note place="margin">Turbut.</note> that in the great Ocean sea, there is a strange thyng to be consydered, whiche all that haue been in the Indies affirme to be true:<note place="margin">Note.</note> And this is, that lyke as on the lande there are some prouinces fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyle and fruitfull, and some barren, euen so doth the lyke chaunce in the sea: So that at some wyndes the shyppes sayle fyftie, or a hundred, or two hundred leagues and more, without takyng or seeyng of one fyshe: and agayne, in the selfe same Ocean in some places, all the water is seene tremble by the mouyng of the fyshes, where they are taken abundantly. It commeth further to my remembraunce to speake somewhat of the fleeyng of fyshes, whiche is doubtlesse a strange thyng to beholde,<note place="margin">Fleeyng fyshes.</note> and is after this maner. When the shyppes sayle by the great O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean, folowyng theyr viage, there ryseth sometymes on the one syde or on the other, many companies of certayne litle fyshes, of the whiche the byggest is no greater then a Sardyne, and so diminishe lesse and lesse from that quantitie, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ome of them are very litle: these are called <hi>Volatori,</hi> that is, fleeyng fyshes: they ryse by great companies and flockes, in suche multitudes that it is an astonyshment to behold them: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they ryse but litle from the water, &amp; (as it chaunceth) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue one flyght for the space of an hundred paces, and sometimes more, or lesse, before they fall agayne into the sea, sometymes also they fall into the shyppes. And I remember, that on an euenyng when al the company in the shyp were on theyr knees, syngyng <hi>Salue regina</hi> in the hyghest part of the Castell of the poupe, and sayled with a full wynde, there passed by vs a flocke of these fleeyng fyshes, and came so neare vs, that many of them fell into the shyppe, among the whiche, two or three fel hard by me, whiche I tooke alyue in my hand, so that I myght well perceyue that they were as bygge as Sardines, and of the same
<pb facs="tcp:22913:225"/>
quantitie, hauyng two wynges or quilles growing out of theyr synnes, lyke vnto those wherewith all fyshes swym in ryuers: these wynges are as long as the fyshes them selues. As long as theyr wynges are moyst, they beare them vp in the ayre, but assoone as they are drye, they can contynue theyr flyght no further then as I haue sayde before, but fall immediatlye into the sea, and so ryse agayne, and flee as before from place to place.

But the tyme not seruing my purpose by reason of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary wynde, I coulde bryng my shyppes no nearer the Ilande, beyng twelue leagues in length, and syxe in breadth, and about thyrtie in circuite, lying in the three and thyrtieth degree of the North syde.

And surely yf there be any such strayght, we that inhabite those partes do thynke the same should be rather of land then of water. For the fyrme land in some partes thereof is so strayght and narrowe, that the Indians say that from the mountaynes of the prouince of <hi>Esquegua</hi> or <hi>Vrraca</hi> (which are betweene the one sea and the other) if a man ascend to the top of the mountaines, and looke toward the North,<note place="margin">Esquegua and Vrraca.</note> he may see the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the North sea of the prouince of <hi>Beragua:</hi> &amp; againe looking the contrary way, may on the other syde (towards the South) see the sea of <hi>Sur,</hi> and the prouinces which confine with it, as do the territories of the two Lordes or kynges of the sayde prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Vrraca</hi> and <hi>Esquegua.</hi> And I beleeue, that yf it be as the Indians say, of all that is hytherto knowen, this is the narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est strayght of the fyrme land, whiche some affirme to be full of rough mountaynes.

Some measure this way in this part, to be from sea to sea eighteene leagues, whiche I suppose to be rather twentie, not for that it is any more by measure, but because it is rough and difficult, as I haue
<pb facs="tcp:22913:227"/>
sayde, and as I haue founde it by experience, hauyng now twise passed that way by foote, countyng from the port and village of <hi>Nomen Dei,</hi> vnto the dominion of the <hi>Cacique</hi> of <hi>Iuanaga,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse called <hi>Capira,</hi> eyght leagues, and from thence to the ryuer of <hi>Chagre,</hi> other eyght leagues. So that at this riuer, beyng six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene leagues from the sayde port,<note place="margin">The ryuer of Chagre.</note> endeth the roughnesse of the way: then from hence to the marueilous brydge are two leagues, and beyonde that, other two, vnto the port of <hi>Panama</hi>: So that altogeather, in my iudgement, make twentie leagues. And yf therefore this nauigation may be founde in the South sea for the trade of spyces (as we trust in God) to be brought from thence to the sayde port of <hi>Panama</hi> (as is possible enough) they maye afterwarde easely passe to the North sea, notwithstandyng the difficultie of the way of the twentie leagues aforesayde. Which thyng I affirme, as a man wel trauayled in these regions, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng twyse on my feete passed ouer this strayght in the yeere 1521. as I haue said. It is furthermore to be vnderstoode, that it is a marueilous facilitie to bryng spices by this way which I wil now declare. From <hi>Panama</hi> to the ryuer of <hi>Chagre,</hi> are foure leagues of good and fayre way, by the which cartes may passe at pleasure, by reason that the mountaines are but few and litle, and that the greatest part of these foure leagues is a playne grounde voyde of trees: and when the cartes are come to the sayde ryuer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the spyces may be caried in Barkes and pynnesses. For this riuer entreth into the North sea fyue or syxe leagues lower then the port of <hi>Nomen Dei,</hi> and emptieth it selfe in the sea neere vnto an Iland called <hi>Bastimento,</hi> where is a verye good and safe port.

bee beloued of any of them: insomuche that if they knowe any Christian man carnally, they keepe their fayth to him, so that hee bee not long absent farre from them, for theyr intent is not to be widowes, or to liue chast lyke religious women. Many of them haue this custome, that when they perceyue that they are with chylde, they take an hearbe wherwith they destroy that is concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: for they say that only well aged women should beare chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and that they wil not forbeare their pleasures, and defourme their bodies with bearyng of children, whereby theyr teates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come loose &amp; hanging, which thing they greatly dispraise. When they are deliuered of theyr children, they goe to the ryuer &amp; washe them, whiche done, theyr blood and purgation ceasseth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly: And when after this they haue a fewe dayes abstey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from the company of men, they become so strayght, as they say which haue had carnall familiaritie with them, that such as vse them, can not without much difficultie satisfie theyr appetite: They also whiche neuer had chyldren,<note place="margin">The men of India.</note> are euer as virgins. In some partes they weare certayne litle aperues rounde about them before and behynde, as low as to theyr knees and hammes, wherewith they couer theyr priuie partes, and are naked all their bodie besyde. The principall men beare theyr priuities in a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low pype of golde, but the common sorte haue them inclosed in the shelles of certayne great welkes, and are besyde vtterly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked: For they thinke it no more shame to haue theyr coddes seene, then any other parte of theyr bodies: and in many prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces both the men and women go vtterly naked, without any such couerture at all. In the prouince of <hi>Cueua</hi> they call a man <hi>Chuy,</hi> and a woman <hi>Ira,</hi> whiche name is not greatly disagreeable to many both of theyr women and of ours. These Indians gyue great honour and reuerence to theyr <hi>Cacique</hi> (that is) theyr kynges and rulers. The principall <hi>Cacique,</hi> hath twelue of his most strong Indians appointed to beare him,<note place="margin">The kyng is borne on mens backes.</note> when he remoueth to any place, or goeth abrode for his pleasure. Two of them cary him sitting vppon a long peece of wood, which is naturally as lyght as they can fynde, the other tenne folow next vnto him as footemen: they keepe continually a trottyng pase with him on their shoulders. When the two that cary him are weery, other two come in their places, without any disturbance or staye. And
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:22913:230"/>
thus if the way bee playne, they cary him in this maner for the space of .xv or .xx. leagues in one day. The Indians that are assig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to this office, are for the most parte slaues, or <hi>Naboriti,</hi> that is, suche as are bounde to continuall seruice. I haue also no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that when the Indians perceyue them selues to be troubled with to muche blood,<note place="margin">Lettyng of blood.</note> they let them selues blood in the calfes of theyr legges, and brawnes of theyr armes: this doe they with a very sharpe stone, and sometymes with the smal tooth of a Ui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or with a sharpe reede or thorne.

Lykewyse the principall Indians vse these payn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynges on theyr armes and brestes, but not on theyr visages, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause among them the slaues are so marked. When the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of certayne prouinces goe to the battayle (especially the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niball archers) they cary certayne shelles of great welkes of the sea, which they blow, and make therewith great sound,<note place="margin">The Canibals.</note> much lyke the noyse of hornes: they cary also certayne Tymbrels, which they vse in the stead of Drummes: also very fayre plumes of fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and certayne armure of golde,<note place="margin">Armure of golde.</note> especially great and rounde peeces on theyr brestes, and splintes on their armes.

Some of these Indians are poulde and rounded: albeit commonly both the men and women take it for a decent thyng to weare long heare, whiche the women weare to the myddest of theyr shoulders, &amp; cut it equally, especially aboue their browes: this doe they with certayne harde stones, whiche they keepe for the same purpose. The pryncipall women, when theyr teates fall,<note place="margin">Howe the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men beare vp theyr teates, with barres of golde.</note> or become loose, beare them vp with barres of gold, of the length of a spanne and a halfe, well wrought, and of suche byggenesse that some of them weygh more then twoo hundred Castelans or Ducades of golde: these barres haue holes at both the endes, whereat they tye two small cordes made of cotton at euery ende of the barres: One of these cordes goeth ouer the shoulder, and the other vnder the arme holes, where they tye both togeather, so that by this meanes the barre bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vp theyr teates.

These <hi>Coronati</hi> inhabite thyrtie leagues in length by these coastes, from the poynt of <hi>Canoa</hi> to the great ryuer which they call <hi>Guadalchiber,</hi> neere vnto <hi>Sancta Maria de gratia.</hi> As I trauersed by those coastes, I fylled a butte of freshe water of that ryuer, syxe leagues in the sea from the mouth thereof where it falleth into the sea. They are called <hi>Coronati</hi> (that is crowned) because theyr heare is cutte rounde by theyr eares, and poulde lower a great compase about the crowne, much lyke the fryers of saint Augustines order. And because I haue spoken of theyr maner of wearyng theyr heare, heere com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to my remembraunce a thyng which I haue oftentymes noted in these Indians: and this is, that they haue the bones of the sculles of theyr heades foure tymes thycker,<note place="margin">The sculles of the Indians heades.</note> and much stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then ours, so that in commyng to handstrokes with them, it shalbe requisite not to strike them on the heads with swoords, for so haue many swoordes been broken on theyr heades, with litle hurte doone.

The situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is much better then that of Barsalona, by reason that the streates are much larger and plainer, and (without comparison) more directe and streyght foorth: For being builded nowe in our tyme, besyde the commoditie of the place of the fundation, the streetes were also directed with corde, compase, and measure, wherin it excelleth al the cities that I haue seene. It hath the sea so neere, that of one syde there is no more space betwene the sea and the citie then the walles, and this is about fiftie pases, where it is furthest of. On this syde, the waters of the sea beate vpon the natural stones and fayre coast: On the other part, hard by the side and at the foote of the houses, passeth the riuer <hi>Ozama,</hi> which is a marueilous port,<note place="margin">The ryuer Ozama.</note> wherin laden shippes rise very neere to the land, and in maner vnder the house windowes, and no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the mouth of the riuer where it entreth into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sea, then is from the foote of the hil of <hi>Monyuia,</hi> to the monastery of saint Fraunces, or to the lodge of Barsalona. In the myddest of this space in the citie, is the fortresse and castle, vnder the which, and twentie pases distant from the same, passe the shyppes to aryse somewhat further in the same riuer. From the entraunce of the shippes vntyl they cast anker, they sayle no further from the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the citie then thyrtie or fourtie pases, because of this side of the citie the habitation is nere to the riuer.<note place="margin">The Hauen.</note> The port or hauen al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
<pb facs="tcp:22913:234"/>
is so fayre and commodious to defraight or vnlade shippes, as the like is founde but in fewe places of the worlde. The chym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neis that are in this citie, are about syxe hundred in number, and such houses as I haue spoken of before: Of the which some are so fayre &amp; large, that they may well receiue and lodge any lorde or noble man of Spaine with his traine &amp; familie, and especially that which <hi>Don Diego Colon,</hi> viceroy vnder your maiestie, hath in this citie, is such that I knowe no man in Spayne that hath the lyke by a quarter in goodnesse, consydering all the commodities of the same. Lykewyse the situation thereof, as beyng aboue the sayde porte, and altogeather of stone, and hauyng many fayre and large roomes, with as goodly a prospect of the lande and sea as may be deuised, seemeth vnto me so magnificall and princelyke, that your maiestie may be as well lodged therin, as in any of the most exquisite buylded houses of Spayne. There is also a Cathedral church builded of late, where aswel y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Bishop accordyng to his dignitie,<note place="margin">A cathadrall churche and monasteris in Hispaniola.</note> as also the Canons are wel endewed. This church is wel builded of stone and lime, and of good woork<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manshyp. There are furthermore three monasteries, bearyng the name of saint Dominike, saint Fraunces, and saint Marie of Mercedes, the which are all well buylded, although not so curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously as they of Spaine. But speakyng without preiudice of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other religious monasterie, your maiestie may be wel assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that in these three monasteries god is as wel serued, as in any other religious house, with men of holy lyuyng &amp; vertuous exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. There is also a very good hospitall for the ayde and succour of poore people,<note place="margin">An Hospitall</note> which was founde by <hi>Michael Passamont,</hi> trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer to your maiestie. To conclude, this citie from day to day increaseth in wealth and good order, aswel for that the saide Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral &amp; viceroy, with the lorde Chauncelour and counsayle ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted there by your maiestie, haue theyr continuall abydyng heere, as also that the rychest men of the Ilande resort hyther for theyr most commodious habitation, and trade of suche mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaundies as are eyther brought out of Spayne, or sent thyther from this Ilande, whiche nowe so aboundeth in many thynges, that it serueth Spayne with many commodities, as it were with vsury requityng suche benefytes as it fyrst receyued from thence. The people of this Ilande are commonly of somewhat
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:22913:234"/>
lesse stature then are the Spaniardes, and of a shynyng or cleare browne coloure: they haue wyues of theyr owne, and absteyne from theyr daughters, systers, and mothers: they haue large foreheades, long blacke heare, and no beardes or heare in anye other partes of theyr bodies, aswell men as women,<note place="margin">The people.</note> except very fewe, as perhaps scarsly one among a thousand. They goe as naked as they were borne, except that on the partes whiche may not with honestie be seene, they weare a certayne leafe as brode as a mans hande, which neuerthelesse is not kept close with such diligence, but that sometymes a man may see that they thynke sufficiently hyd. In this Iland are certayne Glowormes, that shyne in the nyght as do ours, but are much bygger,<note place="margin">Glowormes.</note> and geue a greater lyght: Insomuch that when the men of the Ilande goo any iorneys in the night, they beare some of these wormes made fast about theyr feete and head, in such sort that he that should see them a farre, &amp; ignorant of the thing, would be greatly astonished thereat.

                     </note> Some suche currant may not be denied to be of great force in the hote Zone, for the nearenes thereof vnto the centre of the Sonne and blustryng easterne wyndes violently dryuing the seas westwarde: howbeit in the temperate climes, the Sonne beyng farther of, and the wyndes more diuerse, blowyng as muche from the north, the west, and south, as from the east, this rule doth not effectually withholde vs from trauey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng eastwarde, ne be we kepte euer backe by the aforesayde Leuante wyndes and streame. But in <hi>Magellane</hi> streict we are violently driuen backe westwarde: Ergo through the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>westerne streicte or <hi>Anian</hi> fret shall we not be able to returne eastwarde? it foloweth not. The fyrst, for that the northwesterne streict hath more sea rome at the least by one hundred Englyshe myles, then <hi>Magellane</hi> fret hath, the onely want wherof causeth all narrowe passages generally to be most violent. So woulde I say in <hi>Anian</hi> gulfe, if it were so narrowe as <hi>Don Diego</hi> and <hi>Zalterius</hi> haue paynted it out, any returne that way to be ful of difficulties, in respect of such streictnes therof, not for the neare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the Sonne, or easterne wyndes, violently forceing that way any leuant streame.

                  <p>Before that we doe come to <hi>Cinceo</hi> we haue to passe through many places, and some of great importance.

Neuertheles such as dwel abrode are very poore, for the multitude of them euery where so great, that out of a tree you shal see many tymes swarme a number of children, where a man would not haue thought to haue founde any one at all.</p>
                  <p>From these places in number infinite, you shall come vnto two cities very populose, and beyng compared with <hi>Cinceo,</hi> not possibly to be discerned which is the greater of them.

I heard one of my felowes say, that he told in one bridge .40. arches. The occasion wherfore these bridges are made so great, is for that the countrey is toward the sea very plaine and low, &amp; ouerwhelmed euer as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sea water encreaseth. The breadth of the bridges, although it bee well proportioned vnto the length therof, yet are they equally buylt, no higher in the middle than at eyther end, in such wyse that you may directly see from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one end to the other, the sydes are wonderfully well engraue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

maner of Rome workes. But that wee did most marueyle at, was therwithall the hugenesse of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> stones, the lyke wherof as we came in to the citie, we dyd see many set vp in places dishabited by the way, to no small charges of theyrs, howbeit to litle pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, whereas no body seeth them but such as doe come bye. The arches are not made after our fashion, vauted with sundry stones set togeather: but paued, as it were, whole stones reaching from one piller to an other, in suche wyse that they lye both for the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches heades, and galantly serue also for the hygh waye. I haue been astunned to beholde the hugenesse of these aforesayde stones, some of them are .xii. pases long and vpwarde, the least a .xi. good pases long, and an halfe.</p>
                  <p>The wayes echewhere are galantly paued with fouresquare stone, except it be where for want of stone they vse to laye bricke: in this voyage wee traueyled ouer certayne hilles, where the wayes were pitched, and in many places no worse paued than in the playne grounde. This causeth vs to thinke, that in all the worlde there be no better workemen for buildinges, than the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inhabitantes of <hi>China.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The countrey is so well inhabited, that no one foote of ground is left vntilled: small store of cattell haue we seene this way, we sawe onely certayne Oxen wherewithall the countrymen doe plough theyr grounde. One Oxe draweth the plough alone, not onely in this shyre, but in other places also, wherein is greater store of cattell. These countrymen by arte doe that in tyllage, which we are constrayned to doe by force. Here be solde the voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinges of close stooles, although there wanteth not the dunge of beastes: &amp; the excrements of man are good marchandise through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all <hi>China.</hi> The dungfermers seeke in euery streete by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunge to buye this durtie ware for hearbes and wood. The cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome is very good for keepyng the citie cleane. There is great aboundance of Hennes, Geese, Duckes, Swyne, and Goates, Wethers haue they none: the Hennes are solde by weight, and so are all other thinges. Two pounde of Hennes fleshe, Goose, or Ducke, is woorth two Foi of their money, that is, d. ob. sterling. Swines fleshe is solde at a peny the pounde. Beefe beareth the same pryce, for the scarcitie thereof, howbeit Northwarde from <hi>Fuquieo,</hi> &amp; farther of from the sea coast, there is Beefe more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

and solde better cheape, Beefe onely excepted, great aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of all these viandes we haue had in all the cities we passed through. And if this countrey were lyke vnto India, the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantes whereof eate neyther Henne, beefe, nor porke, but keepe that onely for the Portugalles and Moores, they would be solde here for nothyng. But it so fallyng out, that the <hi>Chineans</hi> are the greatest eaters in all the world, they doe feede vppon all thinges, specially on porke, the fatter that is, vnto them the lesse lothsome. The highest price of these thinges aforesayde, I haue set downe, better cheape shall you sometymes buye them for the great plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie thereof in this countrey. Frogges are solde at the same price that is made of Hennes, and are good meate amongst them, as also Dogges, Cattes, Rattes, Snakes, and all other vncleane meates.</p>
                  <p>The cities be very gallant, specially neare vnto the gates, the which are marueylously great, &amp; couered with Iron. The gate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses buylt on hygh with Towers, the lower parte thereof, is made of bricke and stone, proportionally with the walles, from the walles vpward, the buyldyng is of tymber, and many stories in it one aboue the other. The strength of theyr townes is in the mightie walles and ditches, artillerie haue they none.</p>
                  <p>The streetes in <hi>Cinceo,</hi> and in all the rest of the cities we haue seene are very fayre, so large and so streight, that it is wonderfull to beholde. Theyr houses are buylte with tymber, the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons onely excepted, the which are layde with stone, in eche syde of the streetes are paynteses or continuall porches for the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantes to walke vnder: the breadth of the streete is neuerthelesse suche, that in them .xv. men may ryde commodiously syde by side. As they ryde they must needes passe vnder many hygh arches of triumph that crosse ouer the streetes made of tymber, and carued diuersely, couered with tyle of fine claye: vnder these arches the Mercers doe vtter theyr smaller wares, and such as lyst to stande there, are defensed from rayne and the heate of the Sunne.

                        <hi>Loutea.</hi>
                     </note> I will first therefore expounde what this worde signifieth. <hi>Loutea</hi> is as muche to say in our language
<pb facs="tcp:22913:250"/>
as Syr, and whan any of them calleth his name, he answereth Syr: and as we doe say, that the kyng hath made some gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, so say they, that there is made a <hi>Loutea.</hi> And for that amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest them the degrees are diuers both in name and office, I will tell you onely of some principalles, beyng not able to aduertise you of all.</p>
                  <p>The maner howe gentlemen are created <hi>Louteas,</hi> and doe come to that honour and title, is by the gyuyng of a broad gyrdle not like to the rest, &amp; a cap, at the commaundement of the kyng. The name <hi>Loutea</hi> is more generall and common vnto moe, than equalitie of honour therby signified, agreeth withall. Such <hi>Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teas</hi> that doe serue their prince in weightie matters for iustice, are created after triall made of their learning: but the other whiche serue in smaller affayres, as Capitaynes, Constables, Serge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antes by lande and sea, Receyuers, and such lyke, wherof there be in euery citie, as also in this, very many, are made for fauour: the chiefe <hi>Louteas</hi> are serued kneelyng.</p>
                  <p>The whole prouince <hi>China</hi> is diuided, as I haue sayde, into thirtiene shyres, in euery shyre at the least is one gouernour cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led there <hi>Tutan,</hi> in some shyres there be two.</p>

                     </note> hygh Commissioners as you would say, or visiters, with full aucthoritie in suche wyse, that they doe call vnto an accompt the <hi>Tutanes</hi> them selues, but their aucthoritie lasteth not in any shyre longer than one yeere. Neuerthelesse in euery shyre beyng at the least seuen cities, yea, in some of them fyftiene or sixtiene, beside other Boroughes &amp; townes not well to be numbred, these visiters, where they come, are so honoured and feared, as though they were some great princes. At the yeeres ende their circuit done, they come vnto that citie which is chiefe of others in the shyre, to doe iustice there: finally busiyng them selues in the sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng out of such as are to receyue the order of <hi>Louteas,</hi> whereof more shall be sayde in an other place.</p>

Theyr exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination done,<note place="margin">Doctors.</note> and tryall made of them, such as haue taken their degree wont to be giuen them with all cerimonies, vse to banket and feast many dayes together (as the <hi>Chineans</hi> fashion is to end all their pleasures with eatyng and drinkyng) and so remayne chosen to doe the kyng seruice in matters of learnyng.<note place="margin">Dutch lyke.</note> The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther examinates founde insufficient to proceede, are sent backe to their studie againe. Whose ignoraunce is perceiued to come of negligence &amp; default, such a one is whipped, and sometymes sent to pryson, where wee lying that yeere whan this kynde of acte was, we found many thus punished, and demaundyng the cause therof, they sayde it was for that they knew not howe to answere vnto certayne thinges asked them. It is a worlde to see howe these <hi>Louteas</hi> are serued and feared, in suche wise, that in publyke assemblies at one shryke they gyue, all the seruitors belongyng vnto iustice, tremble thereat. At their being in these places, whan they lyst to moue, be it but euen to the gate, these seruitors do take them vp, and carry them in seates of beaten golde. After this sort are they borne whan they goe in the citie, eyther for their owne businesse abrode, or to see eche other at home. For the dignitie they haue, and office they doe beare, they be al accompanyed: the very meanest of them all that goeth in these seates is vshered by two men at the least, that cry vnto the people to gyue place, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, they neede it not, for that reuerence the common people hath vnto them. They haue also in theyr company certayne Serge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antes, with their Maces eyther siluered, or altogeather siluer, some two, some foure, other six, other eight, conueniently for eche one his degree. The more principall and chiefe <hi>Louteas</hi> haue go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing orderly before these Sergeantes, many other with staues, and a great many catchpoules with roddes of Indishe canes, dragged on the grounde, so that the streetes beyng paued, you may heare a farre of as well the noyse of the roddes, as the voyce of the cryers. These felowes serue also to apprehende others, and the better to be knowen they weare liuery redde girdles, and in their cappes Pecockes feathers. Behynde these <hi>Louteas</hi> come such as doe beare certayne tables hanged at staues endes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is written in siluer letters the name, degree, and office of that <hi>Loutea,</hi> whom they folowe. In lyke maner they haue borne after
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:22913:251"/>
them hattes agreeable vnto theyr tytles: if the <hi>Loutea</hi> be meane, then hath he brought after hym but one hatte, and that may not be yealowe: but if he be of the better sorte, then may he haue two, three, or foure: the principall and chiefe <hi>Louteas,</hi> may haue all theyr hattes yealowe, the which among them is accompted great honour. The <hi>Loutea</hi> for warres, although he be but meane, may notwithstandyng haue yealowe hattes. The <hi>Tutanes</hi> and <hi>Chians,</hi> when they goe abrode, haue besydes all this before them ledde .3. or .4. horses with theyr garde in armor. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more the <hi>Louteas,</hi> yea and all the people of <hi>China,</hi> are woonte to eate theyr meat syttyng on stooles at hygh tables as we do, and that very cleanly, although they vse nether table clothes nor nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyns. Whatsoeuer is set downe vppon the boorde, is fyrst carued, before that it be brought in: they feede with two styckes, refraynyng from touchyng theyr meate with theyr handes, euen as we do with forkes, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which respect, they lesse do neede any table clothes. He is the nation onely ciuil at meate,<note place="margin">We, that is the Italians and Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes.</note> but also in conuersation, and in courtesie they seeme to exceede all other. Likewise in theyr dealynges, after their maner, they are so ready, that they farre passe all other Gentyles and Moores: the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter states are so vayne, that they lyne theyr clothes with the best sylke that may be founde. The <hi>Louteas,</hi> are an idle generation, without all maner of exercises and pastymes, excepte it be eatyng and drynkyng. Somtymes they walke abrode in the fieldes, to make the souldyars shoot at prickes with theyr bowes, but theyr eatyng passeth: they wyll stande eatyng euen when the other do drawe to shoote. The pricke is a great blanket spread on certayne long poles, he that stryketh it, hath of the best man there standyng a peece of crymson taffata, the whiche is knyt about his head: in this sorte the wynners honoured, and the <hi>Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teas</hi> with theyr bellyes full, returne home agayne. The inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitantes of <hi>China,</hi> be very great Idolaters, all generally do worshyppe the heauens: and as we are woont to saye, God knoweth it: so saye they at euery worde, <hi>Tien Tautee,</hi> that is to saye, <hi>The heauens do knowe it.</hi> Some do worshyp the Sonne, and some the Moone, as they thynke good, for none are bounde more to one then to an other. In their temples, the which they do cal <hi>Meani,</hi> they haue a great altar in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same place
<pb facs="tcp:22913:252"/>
as we haue, true it is that one may goe rounde about it. There set they vp the Image of a certayne <hi>Loutea</hi> of that countrey, whom they haue in great reuerence for certaine notable thinges he dyd.<note place="margin">After the Dutch fation.</note> At the ryght hande standeth the deuyl, muche more vglie paynted then we do vse to set hym out, whereunto great homage is done by suche as come into the temple to aske counsell, or to drawe lottes: this opinion they haue of hym, that he is malitious and able to do euyl. If you aske them what they do thynke of the soules departed, they wil answeare, that they be immortall, and that as soone as any one departeth out of this life, he becommeth a deuyl if he haue liued well in this worlde,<note place="margin">Pithigorian lyke.</note> if otherwyse, that the same deuyl chaungeth hym into a bufle, oxe, or dogge. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to this deuyl do they muche honour, to hym do they sacrifice, praying hym that he wyll make them lyke vnto hym selfe, and not lyke other beastes. They haue moreouer an other sorte of temples, wherein both vppon the altars and also on the walles do stande many Idoles well proportioned, but bare headed: These beare name <hi>Omithofon,</hi> accompted of them spirites, but suche as in heauen do nether good nor euyll, thought to be suche men and women, as haue chastlye lyued in this worlde in abstinence from fyshe and fleshe, fedde only with ryse &amp; salates. Of that deuil they make some accompte, for these spirites they care litle or nothyng at all. Agayne they holde opinion that if a man do well in this lyfe, the heauens wyll geue hym many temporall blessynges, but if he do euyll, then shall he haue infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, diseases, troubles, and penurie, and all this without any knowledge of God. Finally, this people knoweth no other thing then to liue &amp; die, yet because they be reasonable creatures, al seemed good vnto them we speake in our language, though it were not very sufficient: our maner of praying especially pleased them, and truely they are wel ynough disposed to receiue the knowledge of the trueth. Our lorde graunte for his mercie all thynges so to be disposed, that it may some tyme be brought to passe, that so great a nation as this is, peryshe not for wante of helpe.</p>
                  <p>Our manner of praying so well lyked them, that in pryson importunately they besoughte vs to wryte for them
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:22913:252"/>
somewhat as concernyng heauen, the whiche we dyd to theyr contentation with suche reasons as we knewe, howbeit not very cunnyngly. As they do theyr Idolatry they laugh at them selues. If at any tyme this countrey myght be ioined in league with the kyngdome of Portugale, in such wyse that free accesse were had to deale with the people there, they might al be soone conuerted. The greatest fault we do fynd in them is Sodomie, a vice very common in the meaner sort, &amp; nothing strange amongst the best. This sinne were it left of them, in all other thynges so well dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed they be, that a good interpretour in a short space myght do there great good, yf, as I sayde, the countrey were ioyned in league with vs.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore the <hi>Louteas,</hi> with al the people of <hi>China,</hi> are wont to solempnize the dayes of the newe and full Moones in visiting one eache other, and makyng great bankettes, for to that end, as I earst sayd, do tend all theyr pastymes, and spendyng theyr daies in pleasure. They are wont also to solempnize eache one his byrth daye, whereunto theyr kyndred and frendes do resorte of custome, with presentes of Iuelles or money, receyuyng a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne for theyr rewarde good cheare. They keepe in lyke ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner a general feast with great bankets that day theyr kyng was borne. But theyr most principall and greatest feast of al, and best cheare, is the fyrst day of theyr newe yeere, namely the fyrst day of the newe Moone of Februarye, so that theyr fyrst moneth is Marche, and they recken the tymes accordynglye, respect beyng had vnto the reigne of theyr Prynces: as when anye deede is wrytten, they date it thus, Made suche a daye of suche a Moone, and such a yeere of the reigne of suche a Kyng. And theyr auncient wrytynges beare date of the yeeres of this or that Kyng.</p>
                  <p>Nowe wyll I speake of the maner the whiche the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neans</hi> doo obserue in dooyng Iustice, that it maye be knowen how farre these Gentyles doo herein exceede manye Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that be more bounden then they to deale iustly and in trueth. Because the Chinishe Kyng maketh his abode contynually in the Citie <hi>Pachyn,</hi> his kyngdome so great, the shyres so many, as tofore it hath been sayde: in it therefore the Gouernours and Rulers, muche lyke vnto our Shyryffes, be so appoynted
<pb facs="tcp:22913:253"/>
sodenly and speedely discharged agayne, that they haue no tyme to growe naught. Furthermore to keepe the state in more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie, the <hi>Louteas</hi> that gouerne one shyre, are chosen out of some other shyre distaunt farre of, where they must leaue theyr wyues, chyldren, and goodes, carryeng nothyng with them but them selues. True it is, that at theyr commyng thyther they do fynde in a redinesse all thynges necessarie, theyr house, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture, seruantes, and all other thynges in suche perfection and plentie, that they want nothyng. Thus the kyng is well serued without all feare of treason.</p>
                  <p>In the principall cities of the shyres be foure cheefe <hi>Louteas,</hi> before whom are brought all matters of the inferiour townes, throughout the whole realme. Diuers other <hi>Louteas</hi> haue the maneagyng of iustice, and receyuyng of rentes, bounde to yeeld an accompte thereof vnto the greater officers. Other doo see that there be no euyll rule keept in the citie: eache one as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houeth hym. Generally al these do impryson malefactours, cause them to be whypped &amp; racked, hoysing them vp &amp; downe by the armes with a corde, a thyng very vsuall there, and accompted no shame.<note place="margin">The Italians call it the stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At that tyme, when we were in pryson, there died of them aboue threscore and ten. Yf happely any one, hauyng the meanes to geat foode, do escape, he is set with the condemned persones, and prouided for as they be by the kyng, in such wyse as hereafter it shalbe sayde.</p>

                     <pb n="243" facs="tcp:22913:253"/>The <hi>Louteas</hi> obserue moreouer this: when any man is brought before them to be examined, they aske hym openly in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of as many as be present, be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> offence neuer so great. Thus did they also behaue them selues with vs. For this cause amongst them can there be no false witnes, as dayly amongst vs it falleth out. This good commeth therof, that many being alwaies about the iudge to heare the euidence, and beare witnesse, the processe can not be falsifyed, as it happeneth sometymes with vs. The Mores, Gentiles, &amp; Iewes, haue al their sundry othes, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Mores doo sweare by theyr <hi>Mossafos,</hi> the <hi>Brachmans</hi> by theyr <hi>Fili,</hi> the rest likewise by the thynges they do worshyppe. The <hi>Chineans</hi> though they be wonte to sweare by heauen, by the Moone, by the Sunne, and by all theyr Idolles, in iudgement neuerthelesse they sweare not at all. If for some offence an othe be vsed of any one, by and by with the least euidence he is tormented, so be the wytnesses he bryngeth, if they tell not the truth, or do in any poynt disagree, except they be men of worshyppe and credyte, who are beleeued without any farther matter: the rest are made to confesse the trueth by force of tormentes and whyppes. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sydes this order obserued of them in examinations, they do feare so muche theyr kyng, and he where he maketh his abode kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth them so lowe, that they dare not once styrre. Agayne, these <hi>Louteas</hi> as great as they be, notwithstanding the multitude of Notaries they haue, not trusting any others, do write al great processes and matters of importance them selues. Moreouer one vertue they haue worthy of great prayse, and that is, being men so well regarded and accompted of as though they were princes, they be patient aboue measure in geuyng audience. We poore straungers brought before them myght saye what we woulde, as all to be lyes and falaces that they dyd wryte, ne dyd we stande before them with the vsuall cerimonies of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, yet dyd they beare with vs so patiently, that they caused vs to wonder, knowyng specially howe litle any aduocate or iudge is wonte in our countrey to beare with vs. For where so euer in any towne of Christendome shoulde be accused vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen men as we were, I knowe not what ende the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocentes cause woulde haue: but we in a Heathen countrey, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng our great ennimies two of the chiefest men in a whole

This is done once a yeere: who so escapeth that day, may be sure that he shal not be put to death al that yeere folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng, &amp; so remayneth at the kynges charges in the greater prison. In that prison where we lay were al waies one hundred &amp; moe of these condemned persons, besides them that lay in other prisons.</p>
                  <p>These prisons wherin the condemned caytyfes do remayne are so strong, that it hath not been hard, that any prisoner in al <hi>China</hi> hath escaped out of pryson, for in deed it is a thyng impossible. The prisons are thus builded. Fyrst al the place is myghtelye walled about, the walles be very strong and hygh, the gate of no lesse force: within it three other gates, before you come where the prysoners do lye, there many great lodginges are to be seene of the <hi>Louteas,</hi> Notaries, Parthions, that is, such as do there kepe watch and ward day and nyght, the court large and paued, on the one syde wherof standeth a pryson, with two myghtie gates, wherin are kept such prisoners as haue committed enormious offences. This prison is so great, that in it are streates and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket places wherein al thyngs necessarie are sold. Yea some pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners liue by that kynde of trade, buyeng and selling, and letting out beds to hyre: some are dayly sent to pryson, some dayly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, wherfore this place is neuer voyde of seuen or eyght hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men that go at libertie.</p>
                  <p>Into one other pryson of condempned persons shall you goo at three yron gates, the court paued and vauted rounde about, &amp; open aboue as it were a cloister. In this cloister be eight roomes with yron doores, and in eache of them a large Gallerie, wherein euery night the prisoners do lie at length, their feete in the stocks, theyr bodies hampered in huge woodden grates that kepe them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sitting, so that they lie as it were in a cage, sleepe if they can: in the morning they are losed againe, that they may go into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> court.
<pb facs="tcp:22913:255"/>
Notwithstanding the strength of this pryson, it is kept with a garrison of men, part whereof watche within the house, part of them in the Court, some keepe about the pryson with lanterns and watchebelles answeryng one an other fyue tymes euerye nyght, and geuing warning so lowde, that the <hi>Loutea</hi> resting in a chamber not neare thereunto, may heere them. In these pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of condemned persons remayne some .15. other 20. yeeres imprisoned, not executed, for the loue of theyr honorable frendes that seeke to prolong theyr lyues. Many of these prysoners be shomakers, and haue from the king a certayne allowaunce of rise: some of them worke for the keeper, who suffereth them to goe at libertie without fetters and boordes, the better to worke. Howbeit when the <hi>Loutea</hi> calleth his checke rolle, &amp; with the ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per vieweth them, they al weare theyr lyuereys, that is, boords at theyr neckes, yronned hand and foote. When any of these prysoners dieth, he is to be seene of the <hi>Loutea</hi> and Notaries, brought out at a gate so narrow, that there can but one be drawen out there at once. The prysoner beyng brought foorth, one of the aforesayde <hi>Parthians</hi> stryketh hym thryse on the head with an yron sledge, that doone, he is deliuered vnto his frendes, yf he haue any, otherwyse the kyng hyreth men to cary hym to his buriall in the fieldes.</p>
                  <p>Thus adulterers and theeues are vsed. Such as be imprisoned for debt once knowen, lye there vntyl it be payed.

In lyke maner euery artisane paynteth out his craft: the market places be large, great aboundance of all thinges there be to be solde. The citie standeth vppon water, many streames run through it, the bankes pitched, and so broade that they serue for streetes to the cities vse. Ouer the streames are sundry brydges both of tymber &amp; stone, that beyng made leuell with the streetes, hynder not the passage of the Barges to and fro, the chanelles are so deepe.

Sometymes we were so farre of from the sea, that where we came no sea fyshe had been seene, and salt was there very deere, of freshe water fyshe yet was there great aboundance, &amp; that fysh very good: they keepe it good after this maner. Where the ryuers doe meete, and so passe into the sea, there lyeth great store of Boates, specially where no salte water commeth, and that in Marche and Apryll. These Boates are so many that it seemeth wonderfull, ne serue they for other than to take small fyshe. By the ryuers sydes they make leyres of fine and strong nettes, that lye three handfulles vnder water, and one aboue, to keepe and nourysh their fyshe in, vntyll suche tyme as other fyshers doe come with Boates, bryngyng for that purpose certayne great chestes lyned with paper, able to holde water, wherein they carry theyr fyshe vp and downe the ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, euery day renuyng the chest with freshe water, and sellyng theyr fyshe in euery citie, towne, and village, where they passe, vnto the people as they neede it: most of them haue nette leyres to keepe fyshe in alwayes for theyr prouision.

These riuers do meet without at one corner point of the citie. In either of them were so many barges great and small, that we all thought them at the least to be aboue three thousande: the greater number therof was in the lesser ryuer, where we were.

To gard this riuer wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on continually go to &amp; fro <hi>Parai</hi> great &amp; small fraught with salt, fish poudred with pepper, and other necessaries for that countrey: they do lay in diuers places certain <hi>Parai,</hi> &amp; great barges armed, wherin watch &amp; warde is kept day &amp; night in both sides of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, for the safetie of the passage, &amp; securitie of suche <hi>Parai</hi> as doe remayne there, though the traueylers neuer go but many in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. In euery rode there be at the least thirtie, in some two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men, as the passage requyreth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:22913:259"/>This garde is kept vsually vntyll you come to the citie <hi>Onchio,</hi> where continually the <hi>Tutan</hi> of this shyre, and eke of <hi>Cantan,</hi> maketh his abode. From that citie vpwarde, where the ryuer waxeth more narrow, and the passage more daungerous, there be alwayes armed one hundred and fiftie <hi>Parai,</hi> to accompany o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vesselles fraught with marchandyse, and all this at the king his charges. This seemed vnto me one of the strangest thinges I dyd see in this countrey.</p>
                  <p>Whan we laye at <hi>Fuquien,</hi> we dyd see certayne Moores, who knewe so litle of theyr secte, that they could say nothyng els but that Machomet was a Moore, my father was a Moore, and I am a Moore, with some other wordes of theyr Alcorane, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall, in abstinence from Swynes fleshe, they lyue vntyll the deuyll take them all. This whan I sawe, &amp; beyng sure that in many <hi>Chinish</hi> cities the reliques of Machomet are kept, as soone as we came to the citie where these felowes be, I enfourmed my selfe of them, and learned the trueth.</p>
                  <p>These Moores, as they tolde me, in tymes past came in great shippes fraught with marchandise from <hi>Pachin</hi> ward, to a Porte graunted vnto them by the kyng, as hee is wont to all them that traffike into this countrey, where they beyng arriued at a litle towne standyng in the hauens mouth, in tyme conuerted vnto their secte the greatest <hi>Loutea</hi> there. Whan that <hi>Loutea</hi> with all his family was become Moorysh, the rest began lykewyse to doe the same. In this part of <hi>China</hi> the people be at libertie, euery one to worshyp and folow what him lyketh best. Wherefore no body tooke heede thereto, vntyll such tyme as the Moores perceyuyng that many folowed them in superstition, and that the <hi>Loutea</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured them, they began to forbyd wholy the eatyng of Swines flesh. But all this countrymen and women, chosing rather to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake father and mother, than to leaue of eatyng of porke, by no meanes would yelde to that proclamation. For besides the great desyre they all haue to eate that kynde of meate, many of them doe lyue thereby: and therefore the people complayned vnto the Magistrates, accusing the Moores of a conspiracy pretended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them and the <hi>Loutea</hi> agaynst theyr kyng. In this countrey, as no suspicion, no not one trayterous worde is long borne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: so was the kyng speedily aduertised thereof, who gaue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commaundement
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:22913:259"/>
out of hande that the aforesayde <hi>Loutea</hi> should be put to death, and with hym the Moores of most importance: the other to be layde fyrst in pryson, and afterwarde to be sent abrode into certayne cities, where they remayned perpetuall slaues vnto the kyng. To this citie came by happe men and women threescore and odde, who at this day are brought to fiue men and foure women, for it is nowe twentie yeeres agoe this happened. Theyr ofspryng passeth the number of .200. and they in this citie, as the rest in other cities, whyther they were sent, haue theyr <hi>Moscheas,</hi> wherunto they al resorte euery fryday to kepe theyr holydaye. But, as I thynke,<note place="margin">That is theyr temples.</note> that wyll no longer endure, then whiles they do lyue, that came from thence, for theyr posteritie is so confused, that they haue nothing of a Moore in them but abstinence from Swynes fleshe, and yet many of them do eate thereof priuilie. They tell me that theyr natiue countrey hath name <hi>Camarian,</hi> a fyrme lande, wherein be many kynges, and the Indishe countrey well knowen vnto them.<note place="margin">It shoulde seeme by their voyage to be <hi>Cardandan in Ortelius.</hi>
                     </note> It may so be: for as sone as they dyd see our seruauntes (our ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes were <hi>Preuzaretes</hi>) they iudged them to be Indians: many of theyr woordes sounded vppon the Persike tongue, but none of vs coulde vnderstand them. I asked them whether they conuerted any of the <hi>Chinishe</hi> nation vnto theyr secte: they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweared me, that with much a do they conuerted the women with whom they do marry, yeldyng me no other cause thereof, but the difficultie they find in them to be brought from eating swines fleshe and drynking of wine. I am perswaded therfore, that if this countrey were in league with vs, forbyddyng them neyther of both, it would be an easy matter to draw them to our religion, from theyr superstition, wherat they them selues do laugth when they do their Idolatrie. I haue learned moreouer that the sea wherby these Moores that came to <hi>China,</hi> were woont to trauaile, is a very great gulfe,<note place="margin">It seemeth they came vp the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer from the Caspian sea.</note> that falleth into this countrey out from <hi>Tartaria</hi> and <hi>Persia,</hi> leauing on the other syde all the countrey of <hi>China,</hi> and lande of the <hi>Mogorites,</hi> drawyng alwayes towarde the south: and of all lykelyhood it is euen so, because that these Moores, the whiche we haue seene, be rather browne then white, wherby they shewe them selues to come from some warmer countrey then <hi>China</hi> is, neere to <hi>Pachin,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">At cacan.</note> where the

                  <p>We dyd see in this citie many <hi>Tartares, Mogorites, Bremes,</hi> and <hi>Laoynes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ali. Auoins Tartares.</note> both men &amp; women. The <hi>Tartares</hi> are men very white, good horsemen and archers, confinyng with <hi>China</hi> on that side where <hi>Pachin</hi> standeth, separated from thence by great moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines that are betwyxt these kingdomes. Ouer them be certaine wayes to passe, and for both sydes, Castelles continually keapte with souldiers:<note place="margin">Mounte Vsont.</note> in tyme past the <hi>Tartares</hi> were woont alwayes to haue warrs with the <hi>Chineans,</hi> but these fourescore yeeres past they were quiete, vntyll the seconde yeere of our imprysonment. The <hi>Mogorites</hi> be in lyke maner whyte,<note place="margin">Mogorites.</note> and heathen, we are aduertised that of one syde they border vppon these <hi>Tartares,</hi> and confine with the <hi>Persike Tartares</hi> on the other syde, whereof we sawe in them some tokens, as theyr maner of clothes, and that kynde of hat the <hi>Saracenes</hi> do weare. The Moores affirmed, that where the kyng lyeth, there be many <hi>Tartares</hi> and <hi>Mogori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> that brought into <hi>China</hi> certayne blewes of great valewe: al we thought it to be <hi>Vanil</hi> of <hi>Cambaia</hi> woont to be sold at <hi>Ormus.</hi> So that this is the true situation of that countrey, not in the Northpartes, as many tymes I haue harde saye, confynyng with Germanie.</p>
                  <p>As for the Bremes we haue seene in this citie <hi>Chenchi</hi> certaine men &amp; women,<note place="margin">Bremes.</note> amongst whom there was one that came not long since, hauyng as yet her heare tyed vp after the <hi>Pegues</hi> fashion: this woman, and other moe with whom a blacke Moore damsell in our companye had conference, and dyd vnderstande them well ynough, had dwelte in <hi>Peghu.</hi> This newe come woman, imaginyng that we ment to make our abode in that citie, byd vs to be of good comforte, for that her countrey was not distant from thence aboue fiue dayes iourney, and that out of her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey there laye a hygh way for vs home into our owne. Beyng asked the way, she aunsweared that the fyrst three dayes the way lyeth ouer certayne great mountaynes and wyldernesse, afterwarde people to be mette withall agayne. Thence two

Wherfore I doo conclude, that <hi>Chenchi</hi> is one of the confynes of this kyngdome,<note place="margin">Southwarde from Chenchi to the sea.</note> seperated by certayne huge mountaynes, as it hath been already sayd, that lye out towardes the South.

                  <p>This citie, cheefe of other syxteene, is situated in a pleasaunt playne, aboundyng in thynges necessarie, sea fysh only excepted,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Chenchi.</hi>
                     </note> for it standeth farre from the sea: of freshe fyshe so muche store, that the market places are neuer emptie. The walles of this citie are very strong and hygh: one day dyd I see the <hi>Louteas</hi> thereof go vpon the walles, to take the viewe thereof, borne in theyr seates I spake of before, accompanied with a troupe of horsemen, that went two and two: It was tolde me they myght haue gone three and three. We haue seene moreouer, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this aforesayde citie the kyng hath moe than a thousand of his kynne lodged in great pallaces, in diuers partes of the citie: theyr gates be redde, and the entrye into theyr houses, that they may be knowen, for that is the kyng his colour. These gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, accordyng to theyr nearenesse in blood vnto the kyng, as soone as they be maried, receiue theyr place in honour: this place neither encreaseth nor diminisheth in any respect, as long as the kyng lyueth, the kyng appoynteth them theyr wyues and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, allowyng them by the Moneth al thynges necessarie abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, as he doth to his gouernours of shyres and cities, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, not one of these hath as long as he lyueth, any charge or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment at al. They geue them selues to eatyng and drinkyng<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and be for the most part burly men of bodie, insomuche that espi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng any one of them, whom we had not seene before, we myght knowe hym to be the kyng his cosyn. They be neuerthelesse very pleasaunt, courteous, and fayre conditioned: ne dyd we finde, al the time we were in that citie, so much honour and good entertaynement any where, as at theyr handes. They byd vs to theyr houses, to eate and drynke, and when they founde vs not, or were not wyllyng to go with them, they byd our seruantes, &amp; slaues, causing them to syt down with the first. Notwithstanding the good lodging these gentlemen haue so commodious that they
<pb facs="tcp:22913:261"/>
want nothyng, yet are they in this bondage, that duryng lyfe they neuer goe abrode. The cause, as I dyd vnderstand, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the kyng so vseth his cousynes, is that none of them at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye tyme may rebell agaynst hym: and thus he shutteth them vp in three or foure other cities. Most of them can play on the Lute: and to make that kynde of pastyme peculier vnto them only, all other in the cities where they do lyue be forbydden that instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Curtisans and blynde folke only excepted, who be mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, and can play.</p>
                  <p>This king furthermore for the greater securitie of his realme, and the auoydyng of tumultes, letteth not one in al his countrey to be called Lord, except he be of his blood. Many great estates and gouernours there be, that duryng theyr office are lodged Lordlyke, and do beare the port of myghtie Princes: but they be so many tymes displaced, and other placed a newe, that they haue not the whyle to become corrupt. True it is that duryng theyr office they be well prouided for, as afterwarde also lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged at the kynges charges, and in pension as long as they liue, payde them Monethly in the cities where they dwel, by certaine officers appoynted for that purpose. The kyng then is a Lorde only, not one besydes hym as you haue seene, except it be suche as be of his blood. A Nephewe lykewyse of the kyng, the kyng his systers sonne, lyeth continually within the walles of the citie, in a strong pallace built Castelwyse, euen as his other cousins do, remaynyng alwayes within doores, serued by Eunuches, neuer dealyng with any matters. Their festiuall dayes, newe Moones, and ful Moones the magistrates make great bankets, &amp; so do such as be of the king his blood. The king his Nephewe hath name <hi>Vanfuli,</hi> his pallace is walled about, the wall is not high, but foure square, and in circuit nothing inferiour to the walles of <hi>Goa,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Goa is a citie of the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gales in East Indie.</note> the outside is painted red, in euery square a gate, &amp; ouer each gate a tower, made of timber excellently wel wrought: before the principal gate of the foure, that openeth into the high streat, no <hi>Loutea,</hi> be he neuer so great, may passe on horsbacke, or carried in his seat. Amydde this quadrangle standeth the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace where that gentleman lieth, doubtlesse worth the sight, although we came not in to see it. By report the roofes of the towers and house, are glased greene, the greater part of the
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:22913:261"/>
                     <hi>Quadrangle</hi> set with sauage trees, as Okes, Chestnuttes, Cypres, Pineapples, Cedars, and other suche lyke that we do wante, after the maner of a wood, wherin are keapt Stagges, Oxen, and other beastes, for that Lorde his recreation neuer go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng abrode, as I haue sayde. One preheminence this citie hath aboue the reste where we haue been, and it of ryght as we do thynke, that besydes the multitude of market places, wherein all thynges are to be solde, through euery streate continually are cryed all thynges necessarie, as fleshe of all sortes, freshe-fyshe, hearbes, oyle, vineger, meale, rise, <hi>in summa,</hi> al thinges so plentifully, that many houses neede no seruauntes, euery thing beyng brought to theyr doores. Most part of the merchantes remayne in the suburbes, for that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cities are shut vp euery night as I haue sayde. The merchantes therefore the better to attende theyr businesse, do chuse rather to make theyr abode without in the suburbes, then within the citie. I haue seene in this ryuer a pretie kynde of fyshyng, not to be omitted in my opinion, and therefore wyll I set it downe. The kyng hath in many ryuers good store of barges full of sea crowes, that breede, are fedde, and do dye therein, in certayne cages, allowed monethly a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne prouision of ryse. These barges the kyng bestoweth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his greatest magistrates, geuyng to some two, to some three of them, as he thynketh good, to fyshe therewithall after this maner. At the houre appoynted to fyshe, all the barges are brought togeather in a circle, where the ryuer is shalowe, and the crowes, tyed togeather vnder the wynges, are let leape downe into the water, some vnder, some aboue, worth the lookyng vppon: eche one as he hath filled his bagge, goeth to his owne barge and emptieth it, whiche done, he retourneth to fyshe agayne. Thus hauyng taken good store of fyshe, they set the crowes at libertie, and do suffer them to fyshe for theyr owne pleasure. There were in that citie, where I was, twentie barges at the least of these aforesayde crowes· I wente almost euery day to see them, yet coulde I neuer be throughly satisfied to see so straunge a kynde of fyshyng.</p>

This countrey is hylly, and pestred with snowe, wherefore it is nether so warme as Portugall, &amp; yet very poore, as farre as we can learne, wantyng oyle, butter, cheese, mylke, egges, suger, honny, vyneger, saffarne, cynamome, and pepper. Barly branne the Ilanders do vse in steede of salte: medicinable thinges holsome for the body haue they none at al. Neuerthelesse in that Iland sundry fruites do grow, not much vnlike the fruites of Spayne: &amp; great store of Syluer mynes are therin to be seene.

The contempte therof causeth among them much discord and debate, manslaughter and murther: euen for theyr reputation they do honour theyr parentes, keepe theyr promises, absteyne from adultery and robberyes, punyshing by death the least robbery done, holdyng for a prynciple, that whosoeuer stealeth a tryfle, wyll if he see occasion steale a greater thing. It may be thefte is so seuerely punished of them, for that the nation is oppressed with scarcitie of al thynges necessarye, and so poore, that euen for mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie they strangle theyr owne chyldren, preferring death before want. These felowes do nether eate nor kyll any foule. They lyue chiefely by fyshe, hearbes, and fruites, so healthfully, that they dye very olde. Of Ryce and Wheate there is no great store.

To be delicate and fine, they put theyr meat into their mouthes with litle forkes, accompting it great rudenes to touch it with theyr fingers: wynter and sommer they drynke water as hot as they may possible abyde it. Theyr houses are in daunger of fyre, but finely made, and cleane, layde all ouer with straw pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lettes, wherevppon they doe both sit in steede of stooles, and lye in theyr clothes, with billets vnder theyr heades.

                     <p>In bryngyng vp theyr children they vse wordes onely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke them, admonishyng as diligently and aduisedly boyes of six or seuen yeeres age, as though they were olde men. They are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen very much to entertayne strangers, of whom most curiously they loue to aske euen in trifles what forreyne nations doe, and theyr fashions. Suche argumentes and reasons as be manifest, and are made playne with examples, doe greatly persuade them. They detest all kynde of theft, whosoeuer is taken in that faulte may be slayne freely of any body. No publike prisons, no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon gayles, no ordinary Iusticers: priuately eche householder hath the hearyng of matters at home in his owne house, and the punishyng of greater crymes that deserue death without delaye.

Thus the Empyre of <hi>Giapan,</hi> in tymes past but one alone, is now diuided into sixtie sixe kyngdomes, the onely cause of ciuile warres continually in that Iland, to no small hynderaunce of the Gospell, whilest the kynges that dwell neare togeather inuade one an other, eche one couetyng to make his kyngdome greater. Furthermore in the citie <hi>Meaco</hi> is the pallace of the high priest, whom that nation honoureth as a God, he hath in his house .366. Idolles, one whereof by course is euery nyght set by his syde for a watcheman. He is thought of the common people so holy, that it may not be lawfull for him to goe vppon the earth: if happely he doe set one foote to the grounde, he looseth his office. He is not serued very sumptuously, he is maynteined by almes.<note place="margin">But his almes are very good.</note> The heads and beards of his ministers are shauen, they haue name <hi>Cangues,</hi> and theyr aucthoritie is great throughout all <hi>Giapan.</hi> The <hi>Cubu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cama</hi> vseth them for Embassadours to decide controuersies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixte princes, and to ende theyr warres, whereof they are wont to make very great gayne.

And thus farre heereof.</p>
                     <p>I come now to other superstitions and ceremonies, that you may see, deare brethren, that whiche I sayde in the beginnyng, howe surlye the deuyll hath deceyued the <hi>Giaponishe</hi> nation, and howe diligent and ready they be to obey and worshyp him. And first, all remembrance and knowledge not onely of Christ our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, but also of that one God the maker of all thinges, is cleane extinguished, &amp; vtterly abolished out of the <hi>Giapans</hi> hartes. Moreouer theyr superstitious sectes are many, wheras it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for eche one to folow that which lyketh him best: but the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall sectes are two, namely the <hi>Amidans</hi> and <hi>Xacaians.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this countrey shall you see many monasteryes, not onely of <hi>Bonzii</hi> men, but also of <hi>Bonziae</hi> women diuersly attyred, for some doe weare whyte vnder, and blacke vpper garments, other goe apparelled in ashe colour, &amp; theyr Idole hath name <hi>Denichi:</hi>
                        <pb facs="tcp:22913:266"/>
from these the <hi>Amidanes</hi> differ very muche. Agayne the men <hi>Bonzii</hi> for the most parte dwell in sumptuous houses, and haue great reuenues. These felowes are chast by commaundement, marry they may not vnder payne of death. In the mydst of theyr Temple is erected an Aulter, whereon standeth a wodden Idole of <hi>Amida,</hi> naked from the gyrdle vpwarde, with holes in his eares, after the maner of Italian Gentlewomen, sittyng on a woodden rose, goodly to beholde. They haue great libraries, and halles for them all to dyne and suppe togeather, and belles wherewith they are certayne houres called to prayers. In the euenyng the Superintendent gyueth eche one a theame for me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation. After mydnyght before the Aulter in theyr Temple they doe say Mattens as it were out of <hi>Xaca</hi> his last booke, one quier one verse, the other quier an other. Early in the mornyng eche one gyueth him selfe to meditation one houre: they shaue theyr heades and beardes. Theyr Cloysters be very large, and within the precincte thereof, Chappelles of the <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toquiens,</hi> for by that name some of the <hi>Giapanish</hi> Sainctes are called: theyr holydayes yeerely be very many. Most of these <hi>Bonzii</hi> be Gentlemen, for that the <hi>Giaponish</hi> nobilitie, charged with many children, vse to make most of them <hi>Bonzii,</hi> not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to leaue for eche one a patrymony good ynough. The <hi>Bonzii</hi> most couetously bent, know all the wayes howe to come by money. They sell vnto the people many scroles of paper, by the helpe whereof the common people thinketh it selfe war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted from all power of the deuylles. They borowe lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse money to bee repayde with great vsury in an other world, gyuyng by Obligation vnto the lender an assuraunce thereof, the whiche departyng out of this lyfe hee may carry with him to hell.</p>
                     <p>There is an other great company of suche as are called <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nambuxu,</hi>

                        </note> with curlde and staryng heare. They make profession to fynde out agayne thinges either lost or stolen, after this sorte. They set before them a chylde, whom the deuyll inuadeth, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vp thither by charmes: of that chylde than doe they aske that which they are desirous to know.</p>
                     <p>These mens prayers both good and bad are thought greatly to preuayle, insomuch that both their blessinges and theyr curses
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:22913:266"/>
they sell vnto the people. The Nouices of this order, before they be admitted, goe togeather two or three thousande in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, vp a certayne high mountayne to do pennance there, three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score dayes voluntarily punishyng them selues. In this tyme the deuyl sheweth him selfe vnto them in sundry shapes: and they, lyke young graduates, admitted as it were felowes into some certayne company, are set foorth with whyte tasselles hanging about theyr neckes, and blacke Bonettes that scarsely couer any more than the crowne of theyr heades. Thus attyred they range abrode in all <hi>Giapan,</hi> to set out them selues and their cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng to sale, eche one beatyng his basen hee carryeth alwayes about with him, to gyue notice of theyr commyng in all townes where they passe.</p>
                     <p>There is also an other sorte called <hi>Genguis,</hi> that make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession to shewe by southsaying where stolen thinges are,<note place="margin">

These dwel in the toppe of an high moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne, blacke in face for the continuall heate of the sunne, for the colde, wyndes, and raynes they doe continually endure. They marry but in theyr owne tribe and lyne: the reporte goeth that they bee horned beastes. They clyme vp most hygh rockes and hylles, and goe ouer very great ryuers by the onely arte of the deuyll, who to bryng those wretches the more into errour, byddeth them to goe vp a certayne hygh mountayne, where they stande myserably gazing and earnestly lookyng for him as long as the deuyll appoynteth them. At the length at noone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyde, or in the euenyng, commeth that deuil, whom they call <hi>Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> among them to shewe him selfe vnto them: this shew breedeth in the braynes and hartes of men suche a kynde of superstition, that it can by no meanes be rooted out of them afterwarde.</p>
                     <p>The deuyll was wont also in an other mountaine to shewe him selfe vnto the <hi>Giaponish</hi> nation. Who so was more desirous than other, to go to heauen and to enioy Paradyse, thyther went he to see that syght, and hauyng seene the deuyll, folowed hym, so by the deuyll persuaded, into a denne vntyll hee came to a deepe pytte. Into this pytte the deuyll was wont to leape, &amp; to take with him his worshypper whom he there murdred. This deceit was thus perceyued. An olde man blynded with this superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was by his sonne dissuaded from thence, but all in vayne.
<pb facs="tcp:22913:267"/>
Wherefore his sonne folowed him priuely into that denne with his bowe and arrowes, where the deuyll gallantly appeared vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him in the shape of a man. Whilest the olde man falleth downe to worshyp the deuyll, his sonne speedily shootyng an arrow at the spirite so appearyng, stroke a Foxe in steede of a man, so so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deynly was that shape altered. This old man his sonne trackyng the Foxe so runnyng away, came to that pit wherof I spake, and in the bottome thereof he founde many bones of dead men, decey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the deuyll after that sorte in tyme past. Thus deliuered hee his father from present death, and all other from so pestilent an opinion.</p>
                     <p>There is furthermore a place bearyng name <hi>Coia,</hi> very famous for the multitude of Abbeyes the <hi>Bonzii</hi> haue therin. The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and founder whereof is thought to be one <hi>Combendaxis</hi> a sut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle craftie felowe, that gotte the name of holynesse by cunnyng speache, although the lawes and ordinances he made were alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather deuilishe: he is sayde to haue founde out the <hi>Giapanishe</hi> letters vsed at this day. In his later yeeres this Sim suttle bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him selfe in a fouresquare graue, foure cubites deepe, seuerely forbyddyng it to be opened, for that than he dyed not, but rested his body, wearyed with continuall businesse, vntyll many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sande thousandes of yeeres were passed, after the whiche tyme a great learned man named <hi>Mirozu</hi> should come into <hi>Giapan,</hi> and than would he ryse vp out of his graue agayne. About his tumbe many lampes are lyghted, sent thyther out of dyuers prouinces, for that the people is persuaded, that whosoeuer is liberall and beneficiall towardes the beautifying of that monument, shall not onely encrease in wealth in this worlde, but in the lyfe to come be safe through <hi>Combendaxis</hi> helpe. Suche as gyue them selues to worship him, liue in those Monasteries or Abbayes, with shauen heads, as though they had forsaken all secular matters, wheras in deede they wallow in all sortes of wickednesse and lust. In these houses, the which are many (as I sayde) in number, doe remaine 6000. <hi>Bonzii,</hi> or thereabout, besydes the multitude of laye men: women be restrayned from thence vppon payne of death.

Wherefore this place is so infamous in all <hi>Giapan,</hi> that if any schollar of that order bee happely taken abrode, hee incontinently dyeth for it. Neuerthelesse these cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syners leaue not dayly to vse theyr wonted wickednesse and knauery.</p>
                     <p>North from <hi>Giapan,</hi> three hundred leagues out of <hi>Meaco,</hi> ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a great countrey of sauage men, clothed in beastes skynnes, rough bodyed, with huge beardes, and monstruous muchaches, the which they hold vp with litle forkes as they drynke. These people are great drinkers of wyne, fierce in warres, and much feared of the <hi>Giapans:</hi> beyng hurte in fight, they washe theyr woundes with salte water, other surgery haue they none. In theyr brestes they are sayde to carry lookyng glasses: their swor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des they tye to theyr heades, in suche wyse, that the handle doe rest vppon their shoulders.

In the midst of a great quadrangle, rayled about, hanged with course lynnen, and agreeably vnto the foure partes of the world, made with foure gates to goe in and out at, is digged a hole: in the hole is layde good store of wood, whereon is raysed gallantly a waued roofe, before that stande two tables furnished with diuers kyndes of meates, especially dry figges, Pomegra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates, and tartes good store, but neyther fyshe nor fleshe: vpon one of them standeth also a chaffre with coles, and in it sweete wood to make perfumes.

The emptie barke is out of hande set a fyre, for honour sake, by theyr friendes that folowe them in an other boate of their owne, thynkyng it blasphemie that any mortal creature should afterward once touche the barke that had been so religiously halowed.</p>
                     <p>Truely whan we went to <hi>Meaco,</hi> eyght dayes before we came to the Isle of <hi>Hiu,</hi> at <hi>Fore</hi> towne, sixe men and two women so dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

Wherefore vnto this place both day and nyght many come very superstitiously in pyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage.

                     <p>It remayneth nowe we speake two or three woordes of those Sermons the <hi>Bonzii</hi> are wont to make, not so many as ours in number, but assuredly very wel prouided for. The Pulpit is erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in a great Temple with a silke Canapie ouer it, therein stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth a costly seate, before the seate a table with a bel &amp; a booke.

These preachers be for the most parte eloquent, and apte to drawe with their speach the myndes of their
<pb facs="tcp:22913:270"/>
hearers. Wherefore to this ende chiefly, suche is theyr greedy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, tendeth all theyr talke, that the people be brought vnder the colour of godlinesse to enryche theyr monasteries, promysing to eche one so much the more happinesse in the lyfe to come, howe much the greater costes &amp; charges they be at in church matters &amp; obsequies: notwithstanding this multitude of superstitious sects and companyes, and the diuersities therof amongst them selues: yet in this principally all theyr superintendentes doe traueyle, so to persuade theyr Nouices in their owne tales and lyes, that they thinke nothing els trueth, nothing els sure to come by euerlasting saluation, nothing els woorth the hearyng. Whervnto they adde other subtilties, as in going, grauitie: in countenance, apparel, and in all other outward shewe, comelynesse. Wherby the <hi>Gia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panes</hi> myndes are so noussed in wicked opinions, and doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue thereby such trust and hope of euerlasting saluation, that not onely at home, but also abrode in euery corner of the towne, continually almost they runne ouer their beades, humbly asking of <hi>Amida</hi> and <hi>Xaca</hi> wealth, honour, good health, and euerlastyng ioyes. Thus than, deare brethren, may you thinke howe greatly they neede the helpe of God, that eyther doe bring the Gospel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this countrey, or receiuing it brought vnto them, do forsake I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry, &amp; ioyne them selues with Christ, being assalted by so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny snares of the deuil, troubled with the dayly dissuasions of their <hi>Bonzii,</hi> and finally so iniuriously, so hardely, so sharpely vexed of their kindread and friendes, that except the grace of God obtey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the sacrifices and prayers of the Catholike church do help vs, it can not be chosen, but that the fayth and constancie of many, if not of all, in these first beginninges of our churches, will great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be put in ieopardie. So much the more it standeth you vppon, that so earnestly long for the health of soules, to commende speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally these <hi>Giaponish</hi> flockes vnto our Lorde.</p>

whyle in maner astonyshed in his secrete phantasie, hee tooke great pleasure therein, and sayde: forasmuch as the Portugales haue now compassed about all the South partes,<note place="margin">The woordes of the Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour of Moscouia.</note> supposed in old tyme to bee inaccessable by reason of great heate, why should we not certaynely thynke that the lyke may bee done about this parte of the North, without feare of colde, especially to men borne and brought vp in that clime: Yet proceedyng further, he sayde, that if his Prince and maister had men that would ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate him to discouer this vyage, there was no Prince in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome that myght doe it with more facilitie. Then calling for a Mappe, in which was the discription of Moscouia,<note place="margin">The way from Moscouia to the North O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean &amp; Cathay</note> and the prouinces subiect to the same, hee declared that from the citie of Moscouia or Mosca, goyng towarde the Northeast for the space of .lx. myles, they come to the ryuer of <hi>Volochda,</hi>

The which way, although it bee a long tracte, as more then .800. myles, neuerthelesse he sayd that in sommer it myght commodiously be sayled. And that whereas it falleth into the sea,<note place="margin">Great woods.</note> there are infinite woods of goodly trees, apte to make shyppes, and the place so conuenient for this purpose, that shypwryghtes and other skylfull woorkemen for all thinges heerevnto apperteynyng, may easily come out of Germanie: also, that the men which are vsed to traueyle the sea of Germanie about the coastes of Gothlande,<note place="margin">Gothlande,</note> should bee best and most apte to attempt this enterpryse, bycause they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate to abyde colde, hunger, and labour.

Unto these woordes he added, that although there were great difficultie in Moscouia, by reason that the way to the sayde sea is full of thicke woods and waters, whiche in the sommer make great mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes, and impossible to be traueyled, aswell for lacke of victuals, whiche can not there be founde, not for certayne dayes, but for the space of certayne monethes, the place beyng desolate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out inhabitauntes: neuerthelesse he sayde, that if there were with his Prince, onely two Spanyardes or Portugales, to whom the charge of this viage should be committed,<note place="margin">Commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyardes and Portugales.</note> he no wayes doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but that they would folowe it, and fynde it, forasmuch as with great ingeniousnesse and inestimable pacience, these nations haue ouercome much greater difficulties then are these, whiche are but litle in comparison to those that they haue ouerpassed, and doe ouerpasse in all their viages to India.

                  <p>And heere makyng a certayne pause, and turnyng him selfe towarde vs, hee sayde, Doe you not vnderstande to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, howe to passe to India towarde the Northwest wynde, as dyd of late a citizen of Uenece, so valiant a man,<note place="margin">Sebastian Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bote the grand pylot of the West Indies.</note> and so well prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised in all thinges perteynyng to nauigations, and the science of Cosmographie, that at this present hee hath not his lyke in Spayne, insomuche that for his vertues hee is preferred aboue all other pylottes that sayle to the West Indies, who may not passe thyther without his lycence, and is therefore called <hi>Piloto Maggiore</hi> (that is) the graunde pylote. And when we sayde that wee knewe him not, hee proceeded, saying, that beyng certayne yeeres in the citie of Siuile, and desirous to haue some knowledge of the nauigations of the Spanyardes, it was tolde him that there was in the citie a valiant man, a Ueneci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an borne, named <hi>Sebastian Cabote,</hi> who had the charge of those thinges, beyng an expert man in that science,<note place="margin">Commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sebasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Cabote.

When my father departed from Uenece, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeeres since, to dwell in Englande, to folowe the trade of merchandyes, hee tooke mee with him to the citie of London, whyle I was very young, yet hauing neuerthelesse some know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of letters of humanitie, and of the sphere.

who then reigned: insomuche that all men with great admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion affirmed it to be a thing more diuine then humane, to sayle by the West into the East where spyces growe, by a way that was neuer knowen before. By which fame and report, there increased in my harte a great flame of desyre to attempte some notable thyng. And vnderstandyng by reason of the sphere, that if I should sayle by the way of the Northwest wynde, I should by a shorter tracte come to India,<note place="margin">The fyrst vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of Sebasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Cabote.</note> I therevppon cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the kyng to bee aduertised of my diuise: who immediately commaunded two Carauels to be furnyshed with all thinges ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perteynyng to the vyage, which was as farre as I remember, in the yeere .1496. in the begynnyng of sommer. Beginning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to sayle toward Northwest, not thinking to fynde any other lande then that of <hi>Cathay,</hi> and from thence to turne toward In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia. But after certayne dayes, I founde that the lande ranne towarde the North, which was to me a great displeasure. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse, saylyng along by the coast, to see if I could fynde any gulfe that turned, I founde the lande styll continent to the .56. degree vnder our pole: And seeyng that there the coast turned toward the East, dispayring to fynde the passage, I turned backe agayne, and sayled downe by the coast of that lande towarde the Equinoctiall (euer with intent to fynde the sayde passage to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia) and came to that parte of this firme lande whiche is nowe called <hi>Florida.</hi>

After this, I made many other vyages, whiche I now permyt.

This benefite of the increase of the day doeth augment so much the more in colde regions, as they are nearer the poles: and
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:22913:286"/>
ceaseth not vntyll it come directly ouer the center or poynte of the axes or axceltree of the worlde, where the sunne beyng, at the hyghest in sommer, is eleuate about .xxiiii. degrees:<note place="margin">One day of .vi. monethes.</note> In which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, one continuall day consisteth of .vi. monethes from the spryng tyme, by the standyng of the sunne (called <hi>Solflitium</hi>) in the signe of Cancer, to Autumne. The Sunne therfore, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any offence of the nyght,<note place="margin">Howe the som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in colde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions.</note> gyueth his influence vppon those landes with heate that neuer ceaseth duryng that tyme, which maketh to the great increase of sommer, by reason of continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunce. Wee haue now therefore thought good to geather, by a certayne coniecture, howe greatly we thynke the sommer to be increased heereby.</p>
                     <p>We haue before declared howe hygh the sunne is eleuate ouer the regions that are vnder the poles at the staye of the sunne: And so many partes is it eleuate in Rome at the staye of the sunne in wynter (that is) at the shortest day in the yeere. But here,<note place="margin">Rome.</note> in the myd wynter, the sunne at noonetyde is beneficiall, and bryngeth foorth floures, Roses, and Ie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>floures. I haue geathered some in winter in the moneth of December, not procured at home by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane arte, but growyng in open Gardens in maner in euery bed vnder the bare heauen, brought foorth only by the sunne. But this benignitie of the sunne,<note place="margin">Colde nyghtes in hot regions.</note> continueth not past fyue houres in the naturall day, forasmuch as the operation thereof is extinct by the coldenesse of the nyght folowyng. But if this benefite myght be receyued without hinderaunce of the nyght, as it is vnder the poles, and so continue many monethes in hot regions vnto wyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it should surely bring foorth many wonderful thinges, if moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture fayled not. And by this condition thus propounded,<note place="margin">The Romane wynter.</note> we may well conceyue that the Romane wynter, although it be not hotte, yet to be equall in heate to the full spryng tyme in the same citie, during the tyme of the sayd fyue houres. And thus by a similitude of the height of the sunne vnder both places, and of the knowen qualitie of the Romane heauen, and by the accesse of the sunne to such places where the longest day continueth certayne moneths, we may geather that sommer, in places vnder the pole, is lyke vnto and equall with the full Romane spryng.</p>
                     <p>But the more difficult question,<note place="margin">Our night of vi. monethes.</note> is of the tyme of the .vi. monethes in the whiche the Sunne leaueth those regions,
<pb facs="tcp:22913:287"/>
and goeth by the contrary or ouerthwarte circle toward the south in wynter. For they say that at that tyme, those regions are deformed with horrible darkenesse,<note place="margin">Obiections.</note> and nyghtes not increased, whiche may be the cause that beastes can not seeke theyr foode: And that also the colde should then bee intollerable. By which double euyls all thynges constrayned should dye, so that no beast were able to abyde the iniuryes of wynter and famyne insuyng thereof: but that all beastes should peryshe before the sommer folowyng, when they should bryng foorth theyr broode or succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: and that for these causes, the sayde colde clyme should bee perpetually desolate and vnhabitable. To all which obiections, we answere in this maner.</p>
                     <p>As touchyng the nyghtes not increased, I say, that it was not conuenient to assume that for any reason. For not as the Sunne falleth,<note place="margin">The twy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightes.</note> so sodeynly commeth the darke nyght: but that the euenyng doeth substitute and prolong the day long after, as also the day spryng or dawnyng of the day, gyueth a certayne lyght before the rysing of the Sunne: After the which, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidue of the nyght that receyueth no lyght by the sayde euenyng and mornyng twilightes, is accomplyshed by the lyght of the Moone,<note place="margin">The lyght of the Moone.</note> so that the nyghtes are sildome vnaugmented. Let this bee an example prooued by our temperate regions, whereby we may vnderstande the condition of the nyght vnder the pole: Therefore euen there also the twilightes helpe the nyght a long tyme,<note place="margin">The nyght vnder the pole.</note> as we will more presently demonstrate. It is approoued by the Astronomers, that the Sunne descendyng from the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est halfe sphere by eightiene paralels of the vnder horizon, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth an ende of the twilight, so that at the length the darke night succeedeth:<note place="margin">A demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> And that the Sunne approchyng, and rysing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the hyghest halfe sphere by as many paralels, doeth dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minyshe the nyght and increase the twylyght. Agayne, by the position or placyng of the sphere vnder the pole, the same is the horizontall that is the Equinoctiall. Those paralelles therefore that are paralelles to the horizontall lyne, are also pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralelles to the Equinoctiall. So that the Sunne descendyng there vnder the horizon, doeth not bryng darke nyghtes to those regions, vntyll it come to the paralels distant .xviii. partes from the Equinoctiall.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="277" facs="tcp:22913:287"/>Duryng the tyme of these sayde syxe monethes of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse vnder the pole, the nyght is destitute of the benefite of the Sunne and the sayde twylyghtes, onely for the space of three monethes, in the whiche the Sunne goeth and returneth by the portion of the ouerthwarte circle. But yet neyther this tyme of three monethes is without remedy from heauen. For the Moone with her full globe increased in lyght, hath accesse at that tyme, and illuminateth the monethes lackyng lyght, euery one by them selues, halfe the course of the moneth:<note place="margin">The Moone.</note> by whose benefite it commeth to passe that the nyght, named as vnaugmented, possesseth those regions no longer then one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth and a halfe, neyther that continually or all at one tyme: but this also diuided into three sortes of shorter nyghtes, of the whiche euery one endureth for the space of two weekes, and are illuminate of the Moone accordyngly. And this is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son conceyued of the power of the sphere, whereby we testifie that the sommers and nyghtes vnder the pole are tollerable to ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng beastes. But we wyll nowe declare by other remedies of nature and arte, that this colde so greatly feared, is more remisse and tollerable then our opinion: so that,<note place="margin">Remedies of nature &amp; art.</note> compared to the nature of suche beastes as lyue there, it may be abydden. And there is no doubte but there are autours of more antiquitie then that age in the whiche any thyng was exactly knowen or discouered of the North regions.<note place="margin">The olde writers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture.</note> The olde wryters there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore persuaded onely by naked coniecture, dyd geather what they myght determyne of those places: Or rather, by the estimation of heauen, the whiche, because they felte it to bee hardely tollerable to them selues, and lesse to men borne in the clyme of Egypt and Grecia, tooke thereby an argument of the whole habitable earth. The hystorie of <hi>Strabo</hi> is knowen, that a potte of brasse,<note place="margin">A brasen potte broken with frost.</note> whiche was broken in sunder with frosen water, was brought from <hi>Pontus,</hi> and shewed in <hi>Delphis</hi> in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of a greeuous wynter. Here therefore, they that so great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly feared the wynter (suche as chaunceth to the earth vnder the xlviii. paralele) and therefore consecrated that broken potte to the temple of Appollo: what coulde suche men truely define vppon regions so farre without that paralele, whether they
<pb facs="tcp:22913:288"/>
were inhabited or not? But suche as folowed these, beyng con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with thinuentions of the olde autours, and borne in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner vnder the same qualitie of heauen, persysted wyllyngly in the same opinion, with more confidence then consideration of the thynges whereof we nowe intreate: so lyghtly was that opinion receyued as touchyng the vnhabitable clime vnder the poles. But we with better confidence and faith (forasmuche as we are not instructed with coniectures) intend to stande against the sentence of the olde autours, affirmyng the North regions within the colde clime to be inhabited with herrynges,<note place="margin">Fyshes of the North seas.</note> coddes, haddockes, and brettes, tunnyes, and other great fyshes, with thinfinite number whereof, tables are furnyshed through a great parte of Europe: All whiche are taken in the North sea exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded beyonde our knoweledge. This sea at certayne tymes of the yeere,<note place="margin">The North sea.</note> poureth foorth his plentifulnes, or rather driueth foorth his increase to seeke newe mansions, and are here taken in theyr passage. Furthermore also, euen the mouthes of the riuer of Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber receiued a fyshe as a newe gest sent from the north sea: this swamme twise through Fraunce, and twise through Spayne, ouerpassed the <hi>Ligurion</hi> and <hi>Tuscan</hi> sea, to communicate her selfe to the citie of Rome. The lakes also and ryuers of those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions are replenyshed with fyshe: insomuch that no power of colde is able to extinguyshe thincrease of the yeere folowing, and the succession reparable so many hundred yeeres. And I plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thinke, that if it should of necessitie folowe, that one of these two elementes, the earth and the water, should be destructiue to lyuyng creatures,<note place="margin">The qualitie of water.</note> the water shoulde chiefely haue wrought this effecte. But this is founde so tractable, that in the depe wynter, both that increase is brought foorth, and fyshing is also exercised. The lande is lykewise inhabited with like plentifulnesse. But that we wander not to farre,<note place="margin">The land.</note> let the fayth hereof rest in thexpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition folowing, wherin we intend to declare howe by the power of nature and industry of man, this commoditie may come to passe.<note place="margin">The diuine prouidence in moderatyng the elementes.</note> Therefore as touchyng nature, we suppose that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine prouidence hath made nothyng vncommunicable, but to haue geuen suche order to all thynges, wherby euery thyng may be tollerable to the next.

And here also, if any sharpnesse remaine that may seeme intollerable, nature hath so prouided for the same, with other remedies. For the land and sea, hath geuen vnto beastes, deepe and large Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues,<note place="margin">Caues and Dennes.</note> Dennes, and other hollowe places, and secreete corners in mountaynes and rockes, both on the land and by sea banckes, in the which are euer conteyned warme vapoures, so muche the more intent and vehement, in how much they are the more constrayned by extreeme cold.

He that hath been accustomed to the shadowe of the citie, and wyll attempte the saying of the poet Uirgil, <hi>Nudus ara, sero nudus,</hi> that is, naked and bare, without house and home, shal to his peryl make an end of the verse, <hi>Habe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis frigora febram</hi> (that is) he shal haue the colde ague.

This arte doe they vse agaynst such as sayle by theyr coastes, and staye or moue the ryuers and seas more or lesse, as they lyst to shew fauour or displeasure.

                     </head>
                     <p>THere is an other difference of regions caused of cold and heate. For suche as are neare vnto the poles, are vexed with to muche colde: and suche as are vnder the line where the Sunne is of greatest force, are oppressed with heate. Suche as are in the middest betweene both, are nearest vnto temperatenesse. Under the pole, it is impossible
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:22913:299"/>
that there should be populous cities, bycause the lande is barren, and the caryage or conueyaunce of fruites, victualles, and other necessaryes, is incommodious. By reason whereof, it is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie that the inhabitauntes of such regions lyue euer in continuall wanderyng from place to place, or els in small vyllages. Suche as inhabite temperate regions, haue meane cities, aswell for that they haue more commodious conueyaunce for necessaryes, as also that they may dwel better and more safely togeather then in vyllages, by reason of fortifying their townes with walles, and exercising of artes and occupations, wherby the one may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter helpe the other. Yet that olde Rome (beyng in a temperate region) was of such incredible bygnesse, the cause was, that it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned the Empyre of the worlde, by reason whereof, all nations had confluence thyther, and not the greatnesse of the walles. But it is necessarie that the greatest cities be in hotte regions: fyrst, for that in such regions, part of the soile is either barren if it lacke water, or els most fruitfull if it abounde with water. And for this inequalitie, when they fynde any place meete to susteyne a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, it foloweth of necessitie that great cities be builded in such places, by reason of great concourse of people resortyng to the same. An other great cause is, that whereas in such regions, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chauntes come very farre to such commodious places, they passe through many desarte and perillous regions: So that it shalbe necessary for theyr better securitie, to come in great companyes, as it were great armies. And therefore whereas such a societie is once knyt togeather in a commodious place, it should bee great hynderance aswell to the inhabitants as to marchauntes, if they should wander in incommodious places. And by this confluence, both of such as dwell neare to such places, and also of strangers and such as dwell farre of, it is necessary that in continuaunce of tyme, small townes become great cities, as are these: <hi>Quinsai, Singui, Cambalu, Memphis, Cairus,</hi> or <hi>Alcair,</hi> otherwyse called Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilon in Egypt. But if here any will obiecte Constantinople (in olde tyme called <hi>Bizantium</hi>) beyng in a temperate region, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be not to be compared to such cities as are more then lx. myles in circuite, yet doe we answere herevnto, that the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes Empyre is the cause of the greatnesse hereof, as we sayde before of Rome.</p>

Edwardes answeared, that they were great abundaunce of fine carseis, of brode clothes, of all sortes and coloures, as scarlettes, violettes, and other of the fynest cloth of all the worlde.<note place="margin">The Venetians trafique in England.</note> Also that the <hi>Venetians</hi> brought out of Englande, not onely such clothes redie made, but further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more great plentie of fyne wool to myngle with their wools, of the which they coulde not otherwise make fyne cloth: Affirming that there went out of Englande yeerely that wayes,<note place="margin">English cloths, carses &amp; fyne wool.</note> aboue two hundred thousande carseis, and as manye brode clothes, besyde fine wool and other merchaundies, besyde also the great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunce of like clothes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which were caried into Spaine, <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> and diuers other countreys. The <hi>Sophie</hi> then asked hym by what meanes such merchaundies myght be brought into <hi>Persia.</hi> Ryght well Sir (sayde he) by the way of <hi>Moscouia,</hi> with more safetie and in much shorter tyme then the <hi>Venetians</hi> can bryng them, fyrst from Englande to Uenes, and from thence into <hi>Persia,</hi> by the way of Turkye. And therefore if it shall please your maiestie to graunt vs free passage into al your dominions, with such priuileges as may apperteyne to the safegard of our
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:22913:344"/>
lyues, goodes, and merchandies, we wyl furnysh your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys with al such merchandies, &amp; other commodities, in shorter tyme, and better cheape then you may haue the same at the Turkes handes. This talke and muche more was between the <hi>Sophie</hi> and Edwardes for the space of two houres, all whiche thynges lyked hym so well, that shortly after he graunted to the sayde Arthur Edwardes two other priuileges, for the trade of merchandies into <hi>Presia,</hi> all wrytten in Azure and golde let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and deliuered vnto the lorde keeper of the <hi>Sophie</hi> his great seale. The lorde keeper was named <hi>Coche Califaye,</hi> who sayde that when the <hi>Shaughe</hi> (that is the kyng or prince) dyd sytte to seale any letters, that priuilege shoulde be sealed and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Laurence Chapman. In this priuilege is one principal article for seruantes or merchantes: That yf the Agent do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue that vpon theyr naughtie doynges, they woulde become Busor men,<note place="margin">Busor men, be they that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake theyr faith, and receyue the religion of Mahumet.</note> that then the Agent whersoeuer he shall fynde anye such seruant or seruantes, to take them, and put them in pryson: and no person to keepe them, or maynteyne them. This article was graunted in respect of a custome among the <hi>Persians,</hi> being Mahumetanes: whose maner is frendly to receyue and wel en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertayne, both with giftes &amp; lyuyng, all suche Christians as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sakyng theyr religion, wyl become of the religion of the <hi>Persians.</hi> Insomuch that before this priuilege was graunted, there was great occasion of naughtie seruantes to deceyue and robbe theyr maisters: that vnder the coloure of professyng that religion, they might liue among them in such safetie, that you might haue no law agaynst them, eyther to punysh them, or to recouer your goodes at theyr handes, or els where. For before the <hi>Sophie</hi> (whom they say to be a marueylous wyse and gracious prince) seemed to fauour our nation, and to graunt them such priuileges, the people abused them very much, and so hated them that they would not touche them, but reuiled them, callyng them <hi>Cafars</hi> &amp; <hi>Gawars,</hi> which is, infydels, or misbeleeuers. But after they saw how greatly the prince fauoured them, they had them afterward in great reuerence, and would kysse theyr handes, and vse them very frendly. For before, they tooke it for no wrong to rob them, defraud them, beare false witnesse against them, &amp; such merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies as they had bought or sold, make them take it againe, and
<pb facs="tcp:22913:345"/>
chaunge it as often as them listed. And yf any straunger by chaunce had kylled one of them, they woulde haue the lyfe of two for one slayne, and for the debtes of any straunger, woulde take the goodes of any other of the same nation, with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther such lyke abuses, in maner vnknowen to the Prince, before the complayntes of our men made vnto hym for reformation of such abuses: which were the cause that no merchant strangers of contrary religion, durst come into his dominions with theyr commodities: which myght be greatly to the profite of hym and his subiectes.</p>

with the vse of the same in medicine, who so desireth to know, let him reade Plinie, in the .viii. booke of his natural hystorie.

They had suche plentie thereof in olde tyme, that (as far as I remember) Iosephus wryteth, that one of the gates of Hierusalem was called <hi>Porta Eburnea,</hi> (that is) the Iuery gate.

Of the regions and people about the inner <hi>Libia</hi> (called <hi>Libia Interior) Gemma Phrysius</hi> writeth thus.<note place="margin">

Among other thynges therefore touchyng the maners and nature of the people, this may seeme straunge, that theyr princes and noble men vse to pounce and rase theyr skinnes with pretie knottes in dyuers formes, as it were branched damaske,<note place="margin">They rase theyr skynnes.</note> thynkyng that to be a decent ornament.

Some haue of euery arme one, and as many on theyr legges, wherwith some of them are so galded, that although they are in maner made lame therby, yet wyl they by no meanes leaue them of.

They vse weyghtes and measures, and are very circumspect in occupying the same. They that shall haue to do with them, must vse them gentelly: for they wyl not traffike or bryng in any wares if they be euyll vsed. At the fyrst vyage that our men had into these parties, it so chaunced, that at theyr departure from the fyrst place where they dyd trafike, one of them eyther stole a muske catte, or tooke her away by force,<note place="margin">A musk cat.</note> not mystrustyng that that shoulde haue hyndred theyr bargaynyng in an other place whyther they intended to go.

The eare is inclosed in three blades longer then it selfe, and of two ynches broade a peece.

About two furlongs from the citie is a mount, where the way is cutte out, whiche leadeth to a playne beneath. It is on euery syde fortified with mountains, in the stead of walles or bulwarks, and hath foure entries.

The xviii. daye of Maye, we entred into the citie by the north syde: then by a declynyng way, we came into a playne.

At the foote of the mountayne are two cesterns, which conserue waters without corruption: of these, the one is reserued to minister water to the Camels of the <hi>Carauana</hi> of Babylon or <hi>Alcayr,</hi> and the other, for them of <hi>Damasco.</hi> It is rayne water, and is deriued far of.</p>

On the Tuesday folowyng, our <hi>Carauana</hi> departed from <hi>Mecha,</hi> and I remayned in the Mahumetans house with his wyfe, but he folowed the <hi>Carauana.</hi>

Whilest I laye thus hyd in the Mahumetans house, I can not expresse how friendly his wife vsed me. This al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so furthered my good interteynement, that there was in the house a fayre young mayde, the Niese of the Mahumetan, who was greatly in loue with me.

The Lord of this citie is the Soltan of Babylon, brother to the Soltan of <hi>Mecha,</hi> who is his subiecte. The inhabitauntes are Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans.

But God fayled not to assyst me.

After that fyue and fiftie dayes were paste, the Soltan commaunded that I should be brought before him: and so, set vppon a Camel with my shackles, I came in eight dayes iourney to the place where the Soltan laye, and was brought to his presence in a citie na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Rhada</hi>: for there the Soltan had assembled an army of thirtie thousande men, to make warre agaynst the Soltan of the citie of <hi>Sana,</hi> whiche is three dayes iourney from <hi>Rhada,</hi> and situate partly on the declining of a hyll, and partly in a playne, very fayre to be seene, well peopled, and hauyng plentie of all thinges.

Then these dogges derydyng me, gaue me stones in the steede of bread, and peeces of whyte marble, saying that it was suger: other gaue me clusters of Grapes full of sand. But partly that they should not suspect that I counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feyted madnesse, I ate the Grapes as they gaue me them. When the bruite was spred that I lyued two dayes &amp; nyghtes without meate and drynke:<note place="margin">Madnesse ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note> some began to suspect that I was a holy man, and some that I was starke madde.

When they came vnto me, to geue theyr iudgement what maner of man I was, certayne merchantes asked them yf I were a holy man, or a madde man. These were also of diuers opinions, some affyrmyng one thyng, and some another. Whyle they were yet debatyng this matter, for the space of an houre, I pyssed in my handes, and hurlde it in theyr faces: whereby they agreed that I was no Sainct, but a mad man. The queene seyng all this at the wyndowe, laughed well thereat among her maydens, and sayd thus to them, By the goodnesse of God, and by the head of <hi>Mahumet,</hi> this is a good man. The day folowyng, when in the mornyng I founde hym a sleepe that had so sore hurt me with stones, I tooke hym by the heare of the head with both handes, and with my knee so pounched hym on the stomacke, and battered his face, that I left hym all blooddy, and half dead.

Therfore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> day folowyng, I tooke my iorney, and in the space of eyght dayes, came to the citie of <hi>Aden</hi>: and shortly after my commyng, vysited the man of whom was so great reporte of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynesse, and whom the people honoured for a saint.<note place="margin">A holy saint.</note> And this onely, because he had euer lyued in great pouertie, and without the company of women.

Uppon the saddelles, they place on euery syde a litle house, or if you will, rather call them Turrettes, or Cagies, made of wood: euery Turret con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyneth three men. Betweene the two Turrettes, sitteth an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian on the backe of the beast, and speaketh to him in his owne language, whiche the beast vnderstandeth and obeyeth: for it is certaine that no other beast approcheth so neare to the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng of man.

Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the trunke or snoute of the Elephant (which of the Latines is called <hi>Promuscis,</hi> or <hi>Proboscis,</hi> and of some,<note place="margin">Howe the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant is armed</note> the hande of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant) is armed, and hath a swoord fastened to it of the length of two cubites, very strong, and of a handfull in breadth.

One Elephant exceedeth the bygnesse of three Bufles, &amp; not vnlyke of heare.

Then I pray you (sayd he) do what you can to helpe this my friend. We went therfore togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the sicke man, whom my companion asked where he felt him selfe most greeued. In my head (sayde he) and my stomake, hauyng also my belly so sore bounde, that I can not goe to the stoole. Then my companion agayne in his presence, desired me to consider his infirmitie, and take vpon me to minister vnto him some medicine. My companion had tolde me before, that he was a great eater and drinker. Therefore, takyng him by the hande, and feelyng his pulse, I sayde that his stomacke and bowelles were full of choler, by reason of surfetyng, and therefore that it shoulde be good for him to take a glister. Then sayde the sicke man, Doe what you wil, I wil abyde your order. Then made I a glister of egges,<note place="margin">A glister.</note> salt, and suger, adding also butter and certayne hearbes, such as came first to my memorie vpon the sodayne, and in the space of a day and nyght, I gaue him fyue glisters, but all in vayne: for besyde the paynes which he endured, he was rather woorse then better, insomuche that it repented me of myne enter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>prise:

But it was nowe best to set a good face on the matter, and attempte an other way,<note place="margin">A straunge mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistring of a glister.</note> but the laste errour was woorse then the first. Yet still putting him in good hope, I vsed him thus. I made him lye grouelyng on his belly, &amp; then tying cordes on his feete, I raysed vp the hynder partes of his body, so that he rested only vppon his brest and handes, and as he laye, ministred a glyster vnto him, and let him so hang for the space of hallfe an houre. My companion beholding this straunge kynde of practise, sayde vnto me, Lodouike, is this the maner of mynistring to sicke folkes in your countrey? It is, sayde I, yet neuer but in case of extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie. Then smylyng, he sayde, I beleeue it will heale him one way or an other. In the meane tyme the miserable man cryed, saying in his language, It is enough, it is enough, for my soule now departeth.

And by this aduenturous cure, I began to bee in great credite among them, by the meanes also of my counterfect holinesse, and therefore whereas he would haue giuen me tenne peeces of golde, I would take but only two, and gaue them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so incontinent to the poore.<note place="margin">Sely soules.</note> These sely soules beleeued so much in my hypocrisie (which I shewed no lesse in countenaunce and grauitie, forbearyng also openly to eate fleshe) that well was he that myght haue me in his house, or kysse my handes and feete.

                     <p>DEpartyng from the Cape named <hi>Caput Bonae Spei,</hi> when we had nowe sayled aboute two hundred myles,<note place="margin">Tempest.</note> there rose suddenly a tempest with contrarye wynde. The cause whereof was, that we had on the lefte hande the Ilande of Saint Laurence, and many other litle Ilandes, from whence bloweth for the most part a great gale of wynde. And therefore for the space of seuen dayes, beyng here daungerously tossed to and fro by the rages of the sea and wynde, at the length we escaped, by the grace of God. But proceedyng about two hundred leagues, a newe tempest rysyng so scattred our shyppes in the space of syxe dayes, that we mette not togeather agayne vntyll we arryued at Luxburne in Portugale. I was in the shyppe of Barthelmewe, a Florentine, citizen of Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne. The shyppe was named Saint Uincent,<note place="margin">An exceedyng great shyppe and great rych<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of spyces.</note> a vessell of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedyng capacitie, &amp; laden with seuen thousande tonnes of all sortes of spyces. In the way, we passed also by an other Iland, named the Iland of saint Helen, where we sawe certayne fyshes of suche enorme and monstrous byggenesse,<note place="margin">Great Whale fyshes.</note> that one of them was as bygge as a great house. When they ryse aboue the water, they yane or gape so wyde, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vpper iawe couereth al the forehead, as it were a souldier in shynyng harnesse. Agayne when they swymme on the brymme of the water, the forhead is seene the breadth of three great paces. And when they swymme in the sea, they so trouble the water, and come so neare the shyps, that we were fayne to discharge al our artillarye to dryue them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. Shortly after we founde an Ilande,<note place="margin">The Ilande of Ascention.</note> named the Ilande of Ascention, where we sawe many fowles, about the byggnesse of our Duckes, so symple, without suspicion or feare, that we tooke them with our handes: but shortly after they were taken, they shewed an incredible fiercenesse. I thynke veryly that they neuer sawe any man before, they so behelde vs before they

were taken, and were as styll as if they had ben astonyshed: For in that Ilande we sawe no lyuyng creature, saue onely innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fyshes, and the sayd byrdes. After we had passed this Ilande many dayes sayling, as though we were nowe come to our owne worlde, the North starre, and guardions of our maryners, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared vnto vs. And here oportunitie serueth well, to confute the opinion of them that thynke that men maye not sayle in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions subiect to the pole Antartike or south pole, by the guide of the north starre.<note place="margin">Saylyng by the north starre in regio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s beneath the Equinocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all lyne.</note> For it is certayne, that the Portugales sayle by the guyde of the north starres, although they be vtterly out of syght by the eleuation of the pole Antartike. Yet do they sometymes refreshe the vertue of the needle, with the stone whiche euer naturally respecteth the north pole. A fewe dayes after, we arryued at the fayre region, where are seene many I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landes, named the Ilandes of <hi>Astures,</hi> so named for the multitude of those Egles whiche we commonly call <hi>Astures.</hi> These I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landes are diuersely named: for some are named <hi>Pici, Martij,</hi> some, <hi>Dè Coruo</hi>: also <hi>De Floribus, Sancti Georgij, Gratiosa,</hi> and <hi>Feial.</hi> Departyng from hence, we came to the Ilande of <hi>Tertiera,</hi> where we remayned two dayes. All these Ilandes are maruey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous fruitefull, and haue plentie of all thynges necessary for mans lyfe.

                     <p>The tenth daye of Marche, in the yeere .1521. they wente alande vppon a litle Ilande named <hi>Zamal</hi> .xxx. leagues dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant from the Ilande of theeues.<note place="margin">The Ilande of zamall.</note> Because this Ilande was not inhabited, they rested here a while, where the captayne caused a pauilion to be pitched for the sycke &amp; crased men, and a hogge to be kylled.</p>
                     <p>The .xviii. daye of Marche, they sawe a boate with nyne men commyng towarde them, shewyng them selues ioyfull and reioysyng of theyr commyng. They brought many presentes with them, and seemed to be people of muche humanitie. They gaue the Captayne a great fyshe, and a great vessell of the wyne of those Date trees whiche beare the fruite <hi>Cocus.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Wyne of Date trees.</note> They made also signes, that within the space of foure dayes, they woulde bryng Ryse, and dyuers foules and beastes, as they dyd in deede. This <hi>Cocus</hi> is a fruit of certayne Date trees,<note place="margin">The maruilous fruite Cocus.</note> whereof they make bread, wyne, oyle, and vineger. They make wyne in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. They cutte a bygge branche of the tree, and hange thereat a reede as bygge as a mans legge, into the whiche droppeth a sweete licoure from the tree, like vnto whyte wyne, somwhat tart, and let the reede continue there from mornyng tyl euenyng, and from euenyng to mornyng. The fruite of this tree called <hi>Cocus,</hi> is as bygge as the head of a man, or more. The fyrst rynde of this, is greene, and of the thyckenesse of two fyngers, hauyng in it certayne threedes whereof they make cordes, with the whiche they tye theyr boates. Under this rynde, there is a thycke shell, which they burne and make pouder therof, and vse it as a remedy for certayne diseases. Under this shell, is a white substance lyke the carnel of a Nut, being a fynger in thycknesse, which they eate with fleshe and fyshe, as we do bread. It hath the taste of an Almonde, and is vsed in the steade of bread, when it is dryed.
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:22913:448"/>
In the myddest of this carnell, is a cleare and sweete water, beyng very holsome and cordiale. This water sometyme con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iealeth and lyeth within the shell lyke an egge. When they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende to make oyle hereof, the laye it to putrifie in water, and boyle it vntyll it be lyke oyle or liquide butter. When they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende to make vineger, they suffer onely the water to putrifie, and then set it to the Sunne, where it becommeth vineger, lyke vnto that which is made of whyte wyne. And when they mingle the carnell with the water whiche is in the myddest of the fruite, and strayne it through a cloth, they make a mylke thereof, lyke vnto Goates mylke. These Date trees are lyke vnto them that beare Dates, but are not so full of knottes. With the iuice of two of these Date trees, a whole familie of tenne persons may be mentayned with wyne, vsyng one .viii. dayes, and the other, other .viii. dayes: for they shoulde els be dryed and wythered. These trees continue for the space of a hundred yeeres. This Ilande where they founde this humane and gentle people,<note place="margin">The Iland of zuluan.</note> is called <hi>Zuluan,</hi> and is not very bygge. About this Ilande they founde many other Ilandes,<note place="margin">The sea called Archipelago di san Lazaro.</note> and therefore named this sea <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelago di San Lazaro,</hi> that is, the great sea of saint Lazarus, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng tenne degrees aboue the Equinoctiall towarde our pole, and C.lxi. from the place from whence they departed. The people of this Ilande are <hi>Caphranita</hi> (that is Gentiles.

The chiefest men, haue about theyr heades a sylken cloth of needle woorke. They are grosse and brode set, and of the coloure of an Olyue. They annoynt theyr bodies with the oyle of <hi>Cocus,</hi> to defende them agaynst the heate of the Sunne, and drynesse of the wynde. The .xxv. daye of Marche, they departed from hence, and directed theyr course beteweene the West and southwest, and sayled betweene foure Ilandes, named <hi>Cenalo, Huinanghan, Hibusson,</hi> and <hi>Abarien</hi>

with hym certayne knyues, glasses, and beades of Crystall. After that the Captayne had shewed the Kyng the secretes of his shyp, and suche merchaundies as he had therein, he caused a peece of ordinaunce sodenly to be shotte of, whereat the kyng was greatly amased, vntyl the Captayne comforted hym. Then the Captayne commaunded one of his men to be armed from the head to the foote, and caused three other to stryke hym with theyr swoordes, whereat the kyng marueyled greatly, and sayde to thinterpretour (who was a slaue borne in <hi>Malacha</hi>) that one of those armed men was able to encounter with a hundred of his men. But he marueyled much more, when the Captayne tolde hym by thinterpretoure, howe he founde the strayght by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe and lode stone, and howe many dayes they were without syght of any lande. Then askyng lycence to depart, the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine sent two of his men with hym, of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which <hi>Antonie Pigafetta</hi> was one.

The kyng brought them fyrst to his pallace, where he interteyned them honorably, and gaue them many gyftes, as dyd also the Prince in his pallace, beyng in an other Ilande named <hi>Caleghan.</hi>

                        <pb n="439" facs="tcp:22913:449"/>The last day of Marche, neare vnto Easter, the Captayne cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his priest to say Masse, and sent to the kyng by the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, that his comming a land at that tyme was not to dyne with hym, but only to heare Masse. The Captayne came aland, with fyftie of his men, in theyr best apparel, without weapons or har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and all the residue well armed. Before the boates came to lande, he caused sixe peeces of ordinaunce to be shot of, in token of peace, and so came alande, where the two kynges imbrased hym, and accompanied hym to the place appoynted for Masse to be sayde, not farre from the sea syde. Somewhat before the begynnyng of Masse, the Captayne sprynkled the kynges with Damaske water. When the priest was at myd Masse, at the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fertorie, the kinges profered them selues to go to kysse the crosse with the Captayne, but offered nothyng. At the tyme of sacryng, when the priest lyfted vp the body of Christe, and the Christians kneeled downe and helde vp theyr handes ioyned togeather, the kynges dyd the lyke also, with great reuerence. In the meane tyme, whyle certayne of the Christians were at the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a handgunne was shot of, to signifie vnto them that were in the shippes to discharge al theyr ordinaunce. When Masse was finished,<note place="margin">A combatte.</note> the Captayne caused certayne of his men to put on their harnesse, and to make a cumbat with theyr naked swoordes, whereat the kynges tooke great pleasure. This doone, the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne caused a crosse to be brought foorth, with nayles, and a crowne of thornes, geuyng commaundement to all his men to gyue reuerence therevnto, and signifying to the kynges, by the interpreter, that that banner was gyuen hym by the Emperour his lorde and maister, with commaundement to leaue the same in all places where he came, to the great commoditie and profyte of al such as woulde reuerendly receyue it, as an assured token of frendship, and that he woulde therfore leaue it there, aswel to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishe his lordes commaundement, as also that yf at any tyme any ships of Christians shoulde chaunce to come that way, myght by seyng that crosse, perceyue that our men had been wel enterteyned there, and would therfore not only absteine from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them any hurt or displeasure, but also helpe to ayde them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their enemies: and that therefore it shoulde be requisite to erect that crosse vppon the toppe of the hyghest mountayne that

When the kynges hearde these wordes, they gaue the captaine great thankes, promisyng glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to obserue and fulfyl al such thynges as he required. Then the Captaine demaunded, whether they were Moores or Gentiles: They aunswered,<note place="margin">Moores and Gentiles.</note> that they had none other kinde of religion, but that lyftyng vp theyr handes ioyned togeather, and theyr faces towarde heauen, they called vpon theyr God <hi>Abba.</hi> Which aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere lyked the Captayne very well, because the Gentiles are sooned perswaded to our fayth then the Moores.</p>
                     <p>Departyng from hence, they came to the Ilandes of <hi>Zeilon, Zubut,</hi>

This Ilande is aboue the <hi>Equinoctial</hi> towarde our pole niene degrees, &amp; two thirde partes, and 162. degrees from the place from whence they departed.

                     </p>
                     <p>The seuenth day of Apryll, about noone, they entred into the

After this, the Captayne sent an ambassadour with thinterpretoure to the kyng of <hi>Zubut.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When they approched neere to the citie, they found the kyng with a great company of men sore astonyed at the noyse of the gunnes. But thinterpretour aduertised them, that it was the custome of our men, in all suche places where they come, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge theyr ordinaunce in token of frendshyppe, and to honour the lord of the citie. With which wordes the kyng and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panye were well quieted. After this, the interpretour declared that his master was the Captayne of the shyppes of the greatest Prince in the worlde, and that they went to discouer the Ilandes of <hi>Molucca</hi>: And further, that hearyng of his good name and fame by the report of the kyng of <hi>Messana,</hi> they determyned to visite him, &amp; to haue vittailes for exchange of their merchaundies. The kyng answered, that he was wel content therewith, and that they were hartyly welcome: Neuerthelesse, that it was a custom in that place, that al such shyps as entered into that hauen, should pay tribute: And that there were not many dayes past, sence a shyp laden with golde and slaues dyd so paye. In token whereof, he caused to come before hym certayne merchauntes of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany which yet remayned with hym.<note place="margin">A shyppe laden with gold and slaues.</note> To this thinterpretour an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweared, that forasmuche as his lorde was the Captayne of so myghtie a Prince, he neuer payde tribute to any kyng in the worlde, and would not nowe begyn: Wyllyng hym to take this for a resolute answeare, that if he woulde accepte the peace that was profered him, he shoulde enioy it, and if he rather desyred warre, he should haue his handes ful. When thinterpretour had sayde these woordes, one of the sayde merchauntes (who was a Moore) spake to the kyng in this maner <hi>Catacaia Chitae</hi>: that is, Take heede syr:<note place="margin">Calecut.

<pb facs="tcp:22913:451"/>
at <hi>Calecut</hi> and <hi>Malaca.</hi> When thinterpretoure hearde these woordes, he sayde, that the kyng his Lorde was of much greater puissaunce and more dominions, and lorde of more shyppes then was the kyng of Portugale: declaryng further that he was kyng of Spayne, and Emperour of all Christendome. Addyng hereunto, that if he woulde not be his frende, he woulde hereafter sende thyther suche a power of armed men as shoulde destroy his countrey. The Moore conferred al these woordes with the king, who sayde that he woulde further deliberate with his counsayle, and geue them a full aunsweare the daye folowyng. In the meane tyme he sent them certayne vyttayles and wyne. When all these thynges were declared to the kyng of <hi>Messana,</hi> who was the chiefest thereabout next vnto him, and lord of many Ilandes, he went a lande and repayred to the kyng of <hi>Zubut,</hi> and declared vnto hym the great humanitie and curtesie of the generall Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne. Shortly after, the Captayne sente certayne of his men with thinterpretour to the kyng of <hi>Zubut,</hi> to knowe his pleasure, and what aunsweare he woulde make them. As they went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde the courte, they met the kyng commyng in the streate, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyed with many of his chiefe men. He caused our men to syt downe by hym, and demaunded of them if there were any more then one Captayne in theyr companie: and whether it were theyr request that he should paye tribute to Themperour. They aunsweared, that they desyred none other thyng, but that they myght exercise merchaundies with them, and to barter ware for ware. The kyng made aunsweare, that he was well content therewith:<note place="margin">Sheaddyng of blood is a token of frendshyp.</note> wyllyng the Captayne, in token of frendshyp, to sende hym a litle blood of his ryght arme, affyrmyng that he woulde do the lyke &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>After this, the kyng of <hi>Messana,</hi> with the kyng of <hi>Zubut</hi> his neuie (who was the prince) and certayne other of his gentel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,<note place="margin">The kyng of zu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>but is baptised.</note> came to the shippes, and brought the Captayne many good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly presentes. They entred into great amitie, and had large communication of many thynges. The Captayne persuaded them to the Christian fayth: whiche they gladly embrased, and tooke such pleasure in hearyng the articles of our beliefe, that the teares fell from theyr eyes for ioye. They were baptised, and shortly after all the people of the Ilande. They esteeme nothing more precious then drynkyng glasses of Uenice woorke.

When they came to the citie, they founde the kyng in his Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace sitting vppon a floore or storie made of the leaues of Date trees, wrought after a curious deuise, lyke a certayne kynde of mattes.

At this tyme it so chaunced, that one of the Spanyardes dyed in one of the shyppes, and when certayne of theyr compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny desired the kyng to gyue them leaue to burie him on the land: he answered, that forasmuche as he and all his, were at the commaundement of theyr kyng and maister, howe muche more ought the grounde so to bee? They greatly marueyled at the ceremonies parteynyng to the maner of our funeralles, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured the crosses whiche were set at both the endes the graue.

Their houses are made of Tymber and sawne boordes, and are so buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded aboue the grounde vppon proppes and pyles, that they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cende to the same by certayne stayers. Under theyr houses, they keepe theyr Hogges and Hennes.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:22913:452"/>
After this,<note place="margin">They breake theyr Idolles and erecte the Crosse.</note> the Captayne caused them to breake all theyr Idoles, and to set vp the crosse in dyuers places, praying to the same both mornyng and euenyng kneelyng on theyr knees, and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng vp theyr handes ioyned togeather. The kyng in his bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme was named Charles, after the Emperours name, and the Prince, <hi>Ferdinando,</hi> after the name of his maiesties brother.

The Queene was also baptised,<note place="margin">The Queene of Zabut.</note> with fourtie of her gentlewomen, and her daughter the princes wyfe. The Queene was very young and fayre, hauyng her bodie couered with a whyte cloth. Her lyppes were redde, and she had on her head a Hatte, on the toppe wherof was a triple crowne, much lyke the Popes: this crowne and the Hat, were made of the leaues of Date trees. Within the space of eyght dayes, the inhabitantes of the Ilande were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, excepte one village of Idolatours, who would not herein o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the kynges commaundement. Wherevppon the Captayne sent certayne of his men thyther, who burnt the towne, and erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a crosse in that place, bycause the people of the vyllage were Gentyles (that is) Idolaters. But if they had been Moores (that is, <hi>Machumetistes</hi>) they woulde haue erected a pyller of stone, bycause the Moores are more stubberne and harder to be conuerted then are the gentiles. When the Queene came to the place where she should heare masse, shee came foorth with great pompe and solemnitie,<note place="margin">The Queenes apparell.</note> hauyng going before her three young da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosels, and three men with their Cappes in their hands, whom she folowed apparelled in whyte and blacke, with a great vayle of silke vppon her head, fringed about with golde, which couered her hatte, and hung downe to her shoulders: She had also a great trayne of women folowyng her, beyng all barefooted and naked, excepte that vppon theyr heades and priuie partes they wore certayne vayles of silke, and had theyr heare spredde.</p>

the Idolles in the Ilande were not burnt accordyng to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myse, he answered, that they esteemed them no more as goddes, but only made sacrifice to them for the Princes brother, who was very sicke, and as noble and wittie a man as was in the Ilande. The Captayne answered, that if he would burne all his Idoles, and beleeue faythfully in Christ, and be baptised, he should bee immediately restored to health, and that he would els giue them leaue to stryke of his head.

This freshet hath ben thought to run into the Northwesterne streicte, rather of ignorance (the course therof being not through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowen) than that it so falleth out in deede, as.

One speciall thing I obserued amongst other in reading ouer these .6 7. and 8. Decades, to wyt, the West Indians not onely to be conquered by the Spaniardes, but also to be theyr slaues and bondmen: the cause why after the conquest made of them, the Spanyardes doe in continuall bondage and slauery keepe them vnder, is expresly brought foorth by. <hi>Pe.

there is no truth in them, except it be for theyr owne profit: incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, without all discretion, very vnkynde, &amp; louers of nouelties: they delyght to make them selues dronke with wynes made of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers hearbes, fruites, and graine, as ale and sider, &amp; to ouercome their braynes, as wel otherwise with hearbs, as in making drinke thereof, or eating them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They are very bruitishe, and doe make it a prayse to wallowe in vyces. No obedience, no reuerence at all sheweth the young man to the olde, the childe to his father. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther teaching nor chastning amendeth them: they be traitors, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell, so full of reuenge that they neuer forgyue any offence, great enemyes vnto our religion.

Neither doe the men behaue them selues loyally with theyr wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, nor the wyues with their husbandes: they be superstitiously giuen to soothsaying, as fearful as Hares, filthes, eating lyse, spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, &amp; woormes, whersoeuer they finde them: they haue no arte, nor good condition of men. Hauing learned any pointes of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian religion, they are woont to say that to be good in Spayne, but in India nothing woorth, for that they desire not to alter their maners. They haue no beardes, for they peele and plucke vp the heare as faste as it groweth. They take no pietie on sicke folke, suche as bee very sicke, they gyue ouer to some one kynsman or neighbour of theyrs, or els carry them to the mountaynes to dye there, leauing with them some small portion of bread and water, and so goe theyr way. The elder they waxe, the woorse they bee: vntyll they be .xi. or .xii. yeeres olde, some hope there is that they would prooue ciuil and vertuous, when they grow elder, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come bruit beasts. In conclusion, I say that god neuer created so corrupte a people for vice and beastlinesse, without any mixture of goodnesse and ciuilitie: they are as blockishe as Asses, making no accompt at all to kyll them selues.</p>

Consyderyng then the place from whence you say that you do come, and that which you gyue vs to vnderstand of your great and myghtie lorde and kyng that sent you hyther, we be throughly perswaded that he is our true Lorde, so muche the more, for that, as you say, he hath long since knowen that we dwelt heere Assure your selues therfore, that we wyll all yeelde vnto you, and acknowledge you our lordes, in his name that sent you: in this wyll we not fayle, we wyll not deceyue you, all my

There are solde sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry sortes of mettales iewelles, fruites, foule, hearbes, and all other necessaries seruyng for meates, clothes, warfar, buyldings, and pleasure. For euery speciall kynde of merchaundies, is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted a speciall standyng by it selfe. They sell by tale and measure, the vse of weyghtes as yet they haue not.

To the markets all thinges are brought, eyther by water in <hi>Canoaes,</hi> or on slaues backes. There standeth a goodly palace in the market place for iudgement.

Concernyng their abhominable Idolatry, <hi>Cortesius</hi> is worthy of great commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for the throwyng downe the Idoles where he came, beyng a stranger, though the princes of that prouince and <hi>Meteezuma</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so tooke it not well, principally in the palace, persuadyng them that it was not seemely for a kyng to worshyppe that whiche a

Among the rest, three special houses of recreation the kyng hath in his palace. In one of them are a number of moustrous and defourmed persons,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
dwarfes, crookebackes, syngyng men by nature, twoo headed monsters, and others, with theyr keepers. The second house is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> so large, that in it commodiously two kynges may be resident. The place is set foorth with many Alabaster &amp; Marble pyllers, ten goodly pondes therin, well stored with fyshe, and foule, of al sortes that eyther do lyue in the water, or on the lande, with their keepers, and diuersities of meates for theyr diuers natures. In this place kept he also young chyldren, that had whyte heades, &amp; were of fayre complexion, aswel boyes as gyrles.

The least of these three houses is so well buylt, that the kyng at his pleasure may lodge therein, with all his court. The prince is thus ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.

The buttrey, cellar, pantry, and other offices neuer shut, come in who wyll, meate &amp; drynke he can not want. The hall wherein the kyng dyneth, is matted vnder foote, his meate is brought vp by .300. young men pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners, fleshe, fyshe, fruites, salates of all sortes vppon chaffyng dyshes in the wynter to keepe the meates warme. These way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters neuer come neere the boord, for the kyng sytteth on a leather cushyng artificially wrought, at a table raylled about, within the precincte whereof standeth his Sewer, to set hym downe those meates he lyketh of best. At his ryght hande syxe olde men syt downe, vnto whom the kyng hym selfe carueth. The kyng wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth before meate and after, he is serued in earthen dyshes, his cuppes be of the same mettall: he shyfteth hym selfe foure tymes a daye.

For honour sake eche one commeth into the palace barefoote, in most humble wyse they come before the king, when they are called, bowing downe theyr heads, theyr eies to the ground. It were great presumption to looke the king in the face when he talketh with any of them. A man would thynke they were all dombe in the presence of the kyng, suche is theyr silence. No man dare turne his backe to the kyng, but departyng from hym eche one goeth backewarde. No man dare go out of his place when the kyng passeth by. At his goyng abrode he is fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with a great troupe of his nobles and gentelmen, and hath three rods borne before hym, one whereof he taketh in his owne hand when he commeth foorth out of his lytter, wherin common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he is caryed abrode. In conclusion no heathen prince hath so many cerimonies as this kyng of <hi>Mexico.</hi> Quietly in this citie from the .8. of September the yeere of our lorde .1520. vntyll Maie folowing, remayned <hi>Cortesius</hi> with al honour, enioying his pictorye, and rulyng so myghty a kyngdome conquered by hym, with al prosperitie.

The fyght helde on fyrcely a good while. <hi>Cortesius</hi> was forced in the ende to retyre with some daunger, and losse of many of his soldiers.

Thus spent they in armes the whole daye, yeeldyng a newe supply of men (the multitude was so great) foure tymes an houre, and raysyng clamors all the nyght long to the Spanyardes great annoy, that then coulde take no rest after theyr paynefull and daungerous conflycte the daye tyme, fewe in number, fyghtyng from mornyng to nyght without intermission, and .80. of theyr companye wounded.

The day folowyng, the Spanyardes wanting vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals, issued out in open feelde: they slue many Barbares, they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrew the houses neare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pallace, they tooke certaine draught bridges, but at night they returned with their Generall and 50. of their company wounded, as hungry as they went foorth. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they caused warlike engines to be made of boords, in fourme of a fouresquare house, going on wheeles, placing in ech one ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of .20. shot, whom many rascall souldiers folowed with pikeaxes and hatchets, to do harme that way in destroying their buildings: but stones &amp; dartes came so mightily &amp; so thicke about the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niardes eares, that such as went thus foorth, were faine to creepe home againe out of their engines torne in peeces: they that taried at home could not once looke out but they were domaged. Kyng <hi>Muteezuma,</hi> desirous to dissuade his citizens from the assalt,<note place="margin">Muteezuma slayne.</note> she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyng him selfe vnto them out of the Pallace, had a blowe with a stone, whereof in three dayes he dyed.

                     <p>The next day the nobles of the countrey came to a parle with <hi>Cortesius,</hi>

                        <hi>Mexicans</hi> continuing their assalte, for perill to be stopped at the draught bridges if he departed, so muche the more for that these Barbares were not ignorant of .70. thousand ducates heaped vp togeather by him in that prouince: set vppon them the seconde tyme with the aforesayde engines, but all in vayne. So stoutly their enemyes defended them selues, and so fiercely they resisted the assalte giuen. Chiefly the Spaniardes courage appeared in winnyng of a certayne Tower that alwayes commaunded them, nexte in the ruine of such houses as for the nearenes thereof bred them great incombrance and perill.

I doe not thinke but that in very deede these Spanyardes that sayled <pb facs="tcp:22913:479"/> thus rounde about the world, folowyng continually the west, dyd lose on day in theyr iourney. In lyke maner I am of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that if the Portugales folowed continually the Easte rounde about the worlde, they should fynde at theyr iourneyes ende one day to many. I meane it thus. Let two passengers depart from <hi>Lisbona,</hi> the one Westward, the other Eastwarde, rounde about the worlde, and both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne home agayne that daye whiche we do call Mydsommer daye. I saye that day woulde be to the Easterne passengers the next day after Mydsommer daye, to the westerne trauey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers but Mydsommer euen. My reason is, for that euery .xv. degrees of the great circle East or West, maketh difference one houre: wherefore Eastward after fyfteene degrees, you shal begyn your daye one houre sooner: after fyfteene degrees Westward, you shall ende your daye one houre later, then you dyd in that place whence you dyd set foorth. The whole circle than of the worlde conteynyng precisely .360 degrees, that is, foure and twentie tymes .xv proportionably to the .24 hours of the day, how can it be otherwise, but that these passen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers traueylyng styll eyther Westwarde rounde about the worlde, or Eastwarde, shoulde either mysse a daye at theyr iorneyes ende or elles fynde one to many. </item>
