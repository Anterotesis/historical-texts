            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Unprejudiced Reader.</head>
            <p>IT was the fault of ſome in antient times, that they made void God's Law by mens Traditions; and certainly I may now aſſume the ſame complaint: for whilſt I take a ſerious proſpect of the Spiritual Nature, and tendency of the Second Covenant, which God Almighty, in the fulneſs of time, by his Prophets, propheſied to make and perfect; and alſo the accompliſhment thereof by Jeſus Chriſt, and what was brought to paſs amongſt thoſe Primitive Believers; methinks I do not only ſee an utter aboliſhment of Ceremonial Worſhip, but the inſcribing that <hi>Spiritual Law on the Heart,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of Holy <hi>Fear to the inward Parts,</hi> whereby each perſon became capacitated to know ſo much of God, as ſuited with his preſent ſtate, from an infallible demonſtration in himſelf, and not on the ſlender grounds of mens Lo-here-Interpretations, or Lo-there; for <hi>the Kingdom of God is within,</hi> where himſelf muſt be the Teacher of his People: But on the other hand, when from the noiſe of every parties pretentions to, and contentions for their own way, as moſt infallible, I am induced to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial examination of them; Alas! how have all adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the purity both of Scripture Record, and Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Example? receiving for unqueſtionable Doctrines, the fallible apprehenſions, and uncertain determinations of ſuch Councils, whoſe Faction, Prejudice, and Cruelty ſoon parallel'd the foregoing heatheniſh Perſecutions; and yet that the reſults of perſons ſo incompetently qualified, ſhould at this day in their authority remain unqueſtioned by the Nations, is matter both of aſtoniſhment and pitty; but an implicit Faith has ever been
<pb facs="tcp:106037:3"/>
the conſequence of ignorance, idleneſs and fear, being ſtrong impediments to a judicious inquiry, how far profeſt and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Opinions have their conſiſtency with Reaſon, and the true Religion. But that which moſt of all deſerves a lamentation, is, that <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> whoſe better Arguments have confuted the Plea of ſuch as made Tradition, and mens Preſcriptions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable in Circumſtantials, ſhould themſelves by Print and Practice ſo openly declare and contend for its Authority in Eſſentials; as muſt be obvious to any that obſerve their zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous <hi>Anathema's</hi> againſt whomſoever refuſe a compliance with them in Doctrines, manifeſtly bottom'd upon mens nice Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>This is the right ſtate of the Controverſie that is maintained by us (contemptibly called <hi>Quakers</hi>) againſt the World, and the undoubted reaſon of our ſevere Treatment at its hands, the end of God Almighties raiſing us, being for no other purpoſe than to declare that <hi>which our eyes have ſeen, our ears heard, and which our hands have handled of the Eternal Word,</hi> in oppoſition to the private Opinions, Conjectures, and Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men concerning God and Religion, that all people might thereby be reduced to Faith in, and obedience of the Univerſal <hi>Grace which brings Salvation;</hi> which as it onely can reſtore ſound Judgment concerning God, and effect Redemption from Iniquity, ſo its being relinquiſh'd by men, was the very ground both of their diviſion in Judgment, and corruption in Manners.</p>
            <p>That this hath been, and is our caſe, I ſhall produce an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which is indeed the occaſion of this Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>Two Perſons lately of <hi>Tho. Vincent</hi>'s Auditory in Spittle-Yard, (who goes under the notion of a <hi>Presbyter</hi>) being deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to prove all things, and hold faſt the beſt, viſited our Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, to underſtand if we were as really deſerving blame, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by our Enemies; where it then pleaſed Divine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb facs="tcp:106037:3"/>
to viſit them with the Call of his Light, from the Inventions, carnal Obſervations, will-Worſhip, and vain Converſation of thoſe to whom they formerly were related, that they might be made Children of the day; and though its appearance might be ſmall, yet ſufficient to diſcover them to have been Inhabitants of the Night, and can never be rejected, but it ſhall bring that condemnation which will further teſtifie it to be of God.</p>
            <p>But their relinquiſhing his Congregation, ſo incenc'd this <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian</hi> Preacher, as that his peeviſh Zeal tranſported him beyond, not only the moderation of Chriſtianity, but the civility of education, venting his folly and prejudice much to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <hi>That he had as lieve they ſhould go to a Bawdy-houſe, as to frequent the</hi> Quakers <hi>Meeting, becauſe of their erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous and damnable Doctrines:</hi> And pointing to the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, ſaid, <hi>If there ſhould ſtand a Cup of Poyſon, I would rather drink it, than ſuck in their damnable Doctrines.</hi> He further expreſt himſelf in this manner to one of them; <hi>If ever you go again, I will give you up, and God will give you up, that you may believe a lie, and be damn'd.</hi> Which ſtorms of foul and railing accuſations, proving ineffectual to ſhipwrack that little grain of Faith, his Hearers, as forgetting they hold their preaching by connivance, and the many appeals made by their non-conforming Brethren, for an Indulgence, came with this Caution to the <hi>Pater-Familias,</hi> (or he that was both Husband and Father to the concerned Parties) that he would exerciſe his Authority, as well to refuſe them to all <hi>Quaker</hi>-Viſitants, as prohibit them the liberty of their Conſciences in frequenting our Meetings.</p>
            <p>All which we could not for the Truth-ſake let paſs in ſilence, and therefore did require him to let us have a publick meeting, in which we might have liberty to anſwer on the behalf both of our ſelves and Principles; which after ſome demur, was gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb facs="tcp:106037:4"/>
the day he appointed, and at the ſecond hour in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon. But that he might not want the applauſe of many voices, and doubtleſs to prevent our Friends, (as I am informed) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoke his uſual Auditory to be there at one; and as a man that would not over-ſpend himſelf, or incur a non-plus for want of Seconds, he had his Third and Fourth, two wit, <hi>Tho. Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Tho. Doolittel,</hi> and — <hi>Maddocks,</hi> who at their times (and often out of them) did interpoſe, to whom <hi>Geo. White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> moſtly anſwered; nor had there any thing been ſpoken by another, but from their own example.</p>
            <p>The matter in controverſie will be related in the beginning of this Treatiſe, as a neceſſary Preludium, or Introduction to the following Diſcourſe; The manner of it was ſo groſs, that I know not how to repreſent it better, than by the levity and rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſome Prize; Laughing, Hiſſing, Shooving, Striking, and ſtigmatizing us with the opprobrious tearms of Confident Fellow, impudent Villain, Blaſphemer, &amp;c. And, as the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al refuge of ſhallow Perſons (when they have little elſe to ſay, to prepoſſeſs their Hearers with prejudice againſt the Principles of ſuch as do oppoſe them) he queſtioned much whether I was not ſome <hi>Jeſuite;</hi> Not remembring, or at leaſt unwilling to let the people know, that none have been, nor are more inſtant in the vindication of that Doctrine he and his Brethren did aſſert, (to wit, <hi>God ſubſiſting in three diſtinct perſons</hi>) than the <hi>Jeſuites;</hi> So that, if I ſhould not as well reflect a ſcandal upon their learning by a compariſon, as he did upon my Principle, I could more truly invert Jeſuitiſm upon himſelf: In ſhort, they neither would keep to Scripture tearms them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor ſuffer it in others; but looking upon <hi>G. White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi>'s explanation of their Tearms, and reduction of their Matter (if poſſible) to a Scripture ſenſe (thereby fitting it to the Auditories apprehenſion) to be an indirect way of anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:106037:4"/>
(as that which nakedly did expoſe their tradition all folly to the vulgar) <hi>T.V.</hi> in an abrubt manner fell to his prayer in which he falſly, and with many ſtrangly affected whines, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed us for Blaſphemers unto God; and that he might prevent the clearing of our ſelves, he deſired the people, when he had finiſh'd, to be gone, giving them an example by his and three Brethrens retreat: But we being deſirous further to inform the people of our innocency, they did not only (as before) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to pull us down, but put the Candles out, though ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral perſons of good eſteem, continued, whilſt we ſpoke in vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of our ſelves, from the invectives of our Adverſaries.</p>
            <p>The people ſtill remaining undiſperſed, <hi>T.V.</hi> came very palely down the Stairs (having a Candle in his hand) requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their diſmiſs, at which time he promiſed us, at our requeſt, another meeting; but as one that knew not well what he ſaid, or never purpos'd to perform what he promis'd, has given us ſince to underſtand, he can't in Conſcience ſpare us ſo much time; yet to ſatisfie <hi>G.W.</hi> and my ſelf, in private, he could agree; which ſurely can't be tearm'd another meeting, ſince then it muſt relate to the proceeding one; But how near the relation is betwixt an accuſation before hundreds, and a ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction before none, muſt needs be obvious to every unbyas'd per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: — Our Right ſhould have been altogether as publick as our Wrong: — For which cauſe we were neceſſitated to viſit his Meeting; where on a Lecture day (after a continued ſilence during all his Worſhip) we modeſtly intreated we might be clear'd from thoſe unjuſt reflections before his Congregation, leaving a Diſputation (if he could not then attend it) to ſome more ſeaſonable opportunity: But as one, who reſolv'd inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to mens reputation, as well as cowardize, in baulking a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his own Principles, he ſlunck moſt ſhamefully away; nor would any there, though urg'd to it, aſſume his place to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
<pb facs="tcp:106037:5"/>
his practice towards us, or his Doctrine then deliver'd.</p>
            <p>Reader, What's thy Opinion of this ſavage entertainment? Would <hi>Socrates, Cato,</hi> or <hi>Seneca</hi> have treated us with ſuch unſeemly carriage, whom they call <hi>Heathens?</hi> I ſuppoſe not: And well is it for the truly ſober and conſciencious, they are not lyable to thoſe ſevere laſhes, and that peeviſh uſage, which are the inſeparable Appendixes to a <hi>Scotch</hi> Directory, whoſe cold and cutting gales ever have deſign'd to nip and blaſt the faireſt Bloſſoms of greater Reformation. So much for Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>And what remains, is to inform the Reader, that with great brevity I have diſcuſt and endeavoured a total enervation of thoſe Cardinal Points, and chief Doctrines ſo firmly believed, and continually impos'd for Articles of Chriſtian Faith; <hi>1. The Trinity of ſeparate Perſons, in the Unity of Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. 2. God's incapacity to forgive without the fulleſt ſatisfaction paid him by another. 3. A juſtification of impure perſons, from an imputative Righteouſneſs.</hi> Which Principles, let me tell thee, Reader, are not more repugnant to Scriptures, Reaſon, and Souls-Security, than moſt deſtructive to Gods Honour, in his <hi>Unity, Mercy,</hi> and <hi>Purity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore I beſeech thee to exterminate paſſion from her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominacy, in the peruſal of this abridg'd Diſcourſe, ſince it was writ in love to thee; that whilſt 'tis thy deſire to know Love, and fear God Almighty above mens Precepts, thou mayeſt not miſs ſo good an end, by the blind embraces of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition for Truth. But in the nobility of a true <hi>Berean,</hi> ſearch and inquire; letting the good old Verity, not a pretended Antiquity, (whilſt a meer novelty;) and ſolid Reaſon, not an over-fond credulity, ſway the ballance of thy Judgment, that both ſtability and certainty may accompany thy determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

               <p>IF Diſputations prove at any time ineffectual, it's either to be imputed to the ignorance and ambiguity of the Diſputants, or to the rudeneſs and prejudice of the Auditory; all which may truly be affirmed of <hi>T.V.</hi> with his three Brethren, and Congregation.</p>
               <p>The Accuſation being general, <hi>viz.

               <p>The Queſtion was this, <hi>Whether we own'd one God-head, ſubſiſting in three diſtinct and ſeparate Perſons,</hi> as the reſult of various reviſes and amendments; which being denyed by us, as a Doctrine no where Scriptural, <hi>T.V.</hi> frames this Sylogiſm from the beloved Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples words.</p>

                  <hi>G.VV.</hi> utterly rejected his tearms, as not to be found in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or deduceable from the place he inſtanced; wherefore he deſires their explanation of their Tearms, inaſmuch as God did not uſe to wrap his Truths up in Heatheniſh Metaphiſicks, but in plain Language: Notwithſtanding we could not obtain a better explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then Perſon, nor of Perſon, than the mode of a Subſtance; to all which <hi>G.VV.</hi> and my ſelf urged ſeveral Scriptures, proving Gods compleat unity: And when we queried how God was to be underſtood, if in an abſtractive ſence from his Subſtance: They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded it a point more fit for Admiration than Diſputation. But a little to review his Syllogyſm; the manner of it ſhows him as little a Scholar, as its matter does a Chriſtian; but I ſhall over-look the firſt, and ſo much of the ſecond as might deſerve my Objection to his <hi>Major,</hi> and give in ſhort my Reaſon, why I flatly deny his <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> Propoſition. No one Subſtance can have three diſtinct Subſiſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and preſerve its own Unity, for granting them the moſt favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable definition, every ſubſiſtance will have its own Subſtance; ſo that three diſtinct Subſiſtances, or manner of beings, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire three diſtinct Subſtances of Beings; conſequently three Gods: for if the infinite God-head ſubſiſts in three ſeparate manners or forms, then is not any one of them a perfect and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat ſubſiſtance without the other two; ſo parts, and ſome thing fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite is in God: or if infinite, then three diſtinct infinite Subſiſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and what's this but to aſſert three Gods, ſince none is infinite but God? And on the contrary, there being an inſeparability be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Subſtance and its ſubſiſtance, the Unity of Subſtance will not admit a Trinity of incommunicable or diſtinct Subſiſtances.</p>

               <p>A ſtrange way of Argumentation, to beg what can't be granted him, and take for granted what ſtill remains a Queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> That there are three diſtinct and ſeparate Perſons in one Eſſence: Let them firſt prove their Trinity, and then charge their Blaſphemy; but I muſt not forget this perſons ſelf-confutation, who to be plainer, called them three <hi>Hee's</hi>; and if he can find a He without a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, or prove that a ſubſiſtance is any other than the form of a He, he would do well to juſtifie himſelf from the imputation of Ignorance.</p>

               <p>For 'tis to be remark'd, that <hi>G.W.</hi> is no otherwiſe a Blaſphemer, than by drawing direct conſequences from their own Principles, and recharging them upon themſelves; ſo that he did not ſpeak his own apprehenſions by his Compariſon, but the ſence of their Aſſertion, therefore Blaſphemer and Blaſphemy are their own.</p>

               <p>If God, as the Scriptures teſtifie, hath never been declar'd or believ'd, but as the Holy ONE, then will it follow, that God is not a Holy THREE, nor doth ſubſiſt in THREE diſtinct and ſeparate Holy ONES; but the before-cited Scriptures undeniably prove that ONE is God, and God only is that Holy ONE; therefore he can't be divided into, or ſubſiſt in a Holy THREE, or THREE diſtinct and ſeparate Holy ONES.— Neither can this receive the leaſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice from that frequent but impertinent diſtinction, that he is ONE in Subſtance, but THREE in Perſons or Subſiſtences; ſince
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:106037:7"/>
God was not declared or believed incompleatly, or without his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance; Nor did he require homage from his Creatures, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compleat or abſtracted Being, but as God the Holy ONE; For ſo he ſhould be manifeſted and worſhipped without that which was abſolutely neceſſary to himſelf; A moſt abſurd Blaſphemy. — So that either the Teſtimonies of the aforementioned Scriptures are to be believ'd concerning God, that he is intirely and compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not abſtractly and diſtinctly, the Holy ONE, or elſe their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to be denied by theſe Trinitarians; and on the contrary, if they pretend to credit their Holy Teſtimonies, they muſt neceſſarily conclude their kind of Trinity a Fiction.</p>

                  <head>Refuted from right Reaſon.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. If there be three diſtinct and ſeparate Perſons, then three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct and ſeparate Subſtances, becauſe every perſon is inſeparable from its own Subſtance; and as there is no perſon that's not a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in common acceptation among men, ſo do the Scriptures plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully agree herein; and ſince the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Spirit is God (which their Opinion neceſſitates them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs) then unleſs the Father, Son, and Spirit, are three diſtinct No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things, they muſt be three diſtinct Subſtances, and conſequently three diſtinct Gods.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It's farther prov'd, if it be conſider'd, that either the Divine Perſons are finite or infinite; if the firſt, then ſomething finite is inſeparable to the infinite Subſtance, whereby ſomething finite is in God; If the laſt, then three diſtinct Infinites, three Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, three Eternals, and ſo three Gods.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If each Perſon be God, and that God ſubſiſts in three Perſons, then in each Perſon are three Perſons or Gods, and from three, they will increaſe to nine, and ſo <hi>ad infinitum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. But if they ſhall deny the three Perſons, or Subſiſtencies to be infinite, (for ſo there would unavoidably be three Gods); it will follow that they muſt be finite, and ſo the abſurdity is not abated from what it was; for that of one ſubſtance having three ſubſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is not greater, then that an infinite Being ſhould have three finite modes of ſubſiſting. But though that mode which is finite
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:106037:8"/>
can't anſwer to a ſubſtance that's infinit, yet to try if we can make their Principle to approach common ſenſe; Let's conceive that three perſons, which may be finite ſeparately, make up an infinite conjunctly; however this will follow, that they are no more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable or ſeparate, nor properly ſubſiſtences, but a ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; for the infinite Subſtance can't find a bottom or ſubſtance in any one or two, therefore joyntly. And here I am alſo willing to over-look finiteneſs in the Father, Son, and Spirit, which this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine muſt ſuppoſe.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Again, if theſe three diſtinct Perſons are one, with ſome one thing, as they ſay they are with the God-head, then are not they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable among themſelves; but ſo much the contrary, as to be one in the place of another; for if that the only God is the Father, and Chriſt be that only God, then is Chriſt the Father. So if that one God be the Son, and the Spirit that one God, then is the Spirit the Son, and ſo round. Nor is it poſſible to ſtop, or that it ſhould be other wiſe, ſince if the Divine Nature be inſeparable from the three Perſons, or communicated to each, and each Perſon have the whole Divine Nature, then is the Son in the Father, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in the Son, unleſs that the God-head be as incommunicable to the Perſons, as they are reported to be amongſt themſelves; or that the three Perſons have diſtinctly allotted them ſuch a proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Divine Nature, as is not communicable to each other; which is a like ridiculous and ſhameful. Much more might be ſaid to manifeſt the groſs contradiction of this Trinitarian Doctrine, as vulgarly receiv'd; but I muſt be brief.</p>
