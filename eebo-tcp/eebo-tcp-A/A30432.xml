            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>1 TIM. III. VER. 16.</bibl>
               <q>And without controversie, great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the spirit, seen of Angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, and receive up into glory.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE most venerable part of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion consists in the Mysteries it contains: and the more sacred and sublime that these are, the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to which they belong, becomes thereby so much the more August. The minds of Men are subject to two extreams in the matter of Mysteries: some have such a liking for every thing that pretends to <hi>Mystery,</hi> that this alone serves to recommend all things to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65543:5"/>
them; and as if Religion were designed to give perpetual affronts to Reason, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise things that are intelligible, and think it is a Character of a mean and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible Religion, if it is not full of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable things: and they seem to be so taken with a sickness after <hi>Mystery,</hi> that the more absurd that any Doctrines are, they like them the better: this serving to gild or sweeten the Pill: and perhaps they think that a fond credulity will atone for all other faults; as if an easiness of believing might serve to compound for the most hainous sins. But on the other hand, some have such thoughts of themselves, and of the force and compass of their own Reasons, that they think it an unreasonable imposing on them to expect that they should believe any thing which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not quite comprehend.</p>
            <p>The Mean between these, is to fix such sure measures in this matter as may preserve us both from a tameness, that may expose us to be an easie Prey to every one that will force perswasions on us, with this bugbear, that they are <hi>Mysteries,</hi> and that therefore they ought to be believed, even before they are examined: and also on the other hand, from such a swelling of pride, as to reject every
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65543:5"/>
thing how solemnly soever attested, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it does not agree with our Notions. We have St. <hi>Paul</hi> here in my Text concluding a charge that he had given to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and in him to all that should minister in <hi>holy things,</hi> that he should from the Rules here set him, learn how he ought to behave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in the <hi>Church of God:</hi> for since the World that is ever apt to be implicit in its thoughts of Religion, will judge of that which they do not know, nor understand, I mean the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, from that which they do see and know, I mean the lives of those who do teach and profess it; and since the Majesty that is in some Mysteries requires a suitable authority and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity in those that handle and propose them; therefore the obligation that lies on Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to a great exactness of deportment, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears particularly from this, That the Mystery of their Religion is <hi>without controversie great;</hi> and that it is likewise a <hi>Mystery of godliness</hi> that leads to Right thoughts of God, and to a way of worshipping him, that is suitable to his Nature and Attributes: both which considerations agree to point out this to us, That the Bishops and Pastors of the Church ought to be Men of a sublime pitch of mind, and of an unaffected strictness of holiness.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:65543:6"/>In speaking to these words I shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,</p>

               <item>II. What reason there may be for us to believe such Mysteries as may be revealed to us by God.</item>

               </item>
            </list>
            <p>I. <hi>Mystery</hi> in its common and general No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is a <hi>Sacred Secret:</hi> and it was chiefly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by the Heathens who first used the word, to those Rites and Ceremonies by which Men were either initiated into Religion, or recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to the Deity: and the performance of these things, had in it many secrets which the Priests were careful enough to conceal, and thereby to encrease their value. Among the Romans it was one of the Methods by which the People were managed to make them believe that publick misfortunes rise from some error in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the service that they paid their Gods. A Deputation of fifteen Men who were
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65543:6"/>
of the most intire confidence was appointed on great occasions; to examine the Rituals of their Religion; and these either found or pretended they had found out, both the error that had been committed, and the proper Remedy: upon which it was given out, that the offended Deity was paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and thereupon the People that were out of heart, took new courage; and this to be sure, contributed not a little to the procuring them better Success. From this common use of the Term <hi>Mystery,</hi> it is applied in some places in the New Testament, to some of the Rites and Doctrines of Christians.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Marriage</hi> is said to be a <hi>Mystery,</hi> not as if there were any thing Mysterious in that Compact, which is founded on the Laws of Nature and Society: but St. <hi>Paul</hi> had been shewing the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal tie that is between the Man and the Wife; by which it appears that a Man can no more have two Wives, than a Wife have two Husbands: and upon that he says, That in<note place="margin">Ephes. 5. 32.</note> this lay a <hi>Mystery</hi> relating to <hi>Christ</hi> and the <hi>Church;</hi> that is, a mystical Argument to prove that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were to be brought to equal priviledges in the Dispensation of the Messias with the <hi>Iews:</hi> for the Prophecies having expressed the Union of God with Mankind, in the Messias, under the figure of a Marriage, then it follows according
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65543:7"/>
to the Allegory of a Marriage, that all must be called to him in an equality of priviledge and dignity; and not as the <hi>Iews</hi> imagined, that they were to have many Priviledges under the Messias above the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who were only to have a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond share after them. Now in the Mystical way of arguing which was in use among the <hi>Iews</hi> at that time, it was no ill way to convince them, to shew that the whole Church was to come as one Wife under the same Priviledges: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise a disparity in that, some having more and some fewer, looked like the State of Polyga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, or Concubinate, and not of a single Marriage.</p>
            <p>But to return from this digression: The Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Christian Religion came to be also called <hi>Mysteries,</hi> because in these, Men were initi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated and confirmed in their Religion; yet not by any secret methods that Priests only might know, but in actions that were plain, simple and significative.</p>
            <p>This great Doctrine of the Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, mentioned in my Text, of God's dwelling among us in flesh, is likewise called a <hi>Mystery,</hi> as containing in it, not any secret which was too sacred to be trusted to Lay-hands, that Priests only might know; but carrying in it a sublime discovery of the Divine Nature, and of the Person and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the Saviour of the World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:65543:7"/>II. And this leads me to the second point, which is to shew, That if any such extraordinary dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery is made, we ought not thereupon to be prejudiced against it, because it contains some things, of which we can form no clear and distinct Notion. It seems indeed at first view a hard im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position on us, to require us to believe that of which we can form no thought at all, and which by consequence is nothing to us. It seems also unreasonable to think that God has given us Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties which yet we must contradict and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule in matters of Religion. But all this, how much soever it may be enlarged, and how specious soever it may appear, will have less force when it is considered, That really our Faculties are so defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, that we do not penetrate into the Essence of any one thing what soever; and therefore tho'we can never be obliged to believe any thing that is contrary to our Faculties and to our simplest Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, yet we may be obliged to believe things in which we find Difficulties, through which we cannot make our way.</p>
            <p>The notions of <hi>Time, Space</hi> and <hi>Motion,</hi> are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled with inextricable difficulties; the continui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Matter,</hi> or the admitting of <hi>Vacuities</hi> in it, are subject to no less exceptions; but these are mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of a more remote speculation: That which is more sensible to every one, is, That there are in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65543:8"/>
us thinking Beings, which we call <hi>Souls,</hi> that are united to Beings of a quite different nature, which are <hi>Bodies,</hi> in so strange a manner, that the acts of the Mind give the Body a great variety of motions: We <hi>will,</hi> we <hi>reason,</hi> we <hi>remember, speak,</hi> or <hi>move,</hi> and immediately our animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits go into the Chanels into which they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, without mistaking their Way or their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand. Now, how the acts of a Mind should give, or, at least, direct the motion of Matter, is as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable to us, as how the motions of Matter should give a Mind Pain or Joy; yet after all, in fact we find it is so, though we can give our selves no reasonable account how it should be so. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if we examin <hi>Memory</hi> alone, it affords us mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enough for wonder; for it is not conceivable, how we should have lodged in our Brain the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of all words, persons, and things, which we can call up when we please, and so quick as words come into our Mouths when we speak: Now, what the Nature, the Variety, and Order of all these Figures should be, is that which we can as little understand, as how the Soul should read them, (if I may so speak) and be able to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without them. Thus it appears, that in the thing which of all others we should be like to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand best, I mean our own Souls dwelling in our Bodies, and acting upon them, we plainly
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65543:8"/>
perceive, that a thing may be true, though at the same time all the notions that we can form of it do present to us difficulties concerning it, which we cannot overcome.</p>
            <p>It will then be no prejudice against Religion, if it should offer some things to us, that we can as little reconcile to our own notions, as we can do, that of our Souls lodging in our Bodies, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning them. It seems indeed to be very uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable, how the same Person should be both <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man;</hi> but it is not a whit more conceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, how the same <hi>Man</hi> should consist both of <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Soul,</hi> so united in one, that the Properties of both should belong to the same man, who from the characters of his Mind, may be said to be <hi>just, wise,</hi> and <hi>good;</hi> and from the characters of his Body, may be said to be <hi>tall, fair,</hi> or <hi>sickly.</hi> So that though these, strictly speaking, belong only to one part of a <hi>Man;</hi> yet the denomination from each of them, goes to the whole.</p>
            <p>It cannot be denied, that our Souls are united to our Bodies, though we do not conceive how it should be so; for we must consider, that all that which is imported by this Union, is, that our Bodies being put and kept in such a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical texture and disposition, our Souls act upon and govern them, both in their vital and their free or rational Operations: And this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment

is called the <hi>Union of our Soul and Body;</hi> which is no other than the Bodies being put and kept in such a Mechanical State, that the motion of the Animal Spirits runs regularly through it, which way soever the Acts of the Mind do determine and direct it; and when the structure of the Body is so disordered, that the animal Spirits do their work imperfectly, then Pain and Sickness follow upon it; but when they can do nothing, then Death comes, the Body being no longer in a disposition to be subordinate to the Mind. By vertue of this Union, the Mind receives likewise many Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations from the Body. All which lead us very near the forming somewhat like a notion of the <hi>Union</hi> of the <hi>Two Natures</hi> in Christ. For, if a <hi>Body,</hi> which is a different sort of Beings from the <hi>Soul,</hi> is capable of being brought under such an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate and constant direction from the Mind, as we see it is in our selves; then it is not at all ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd to think, that the Soul of a man should be brought under an immediate and constant actua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Divine Nature, which may as well denominate God and Man to be one, as the Union of the Soul and Body denominates the Compound of both to be one Man: and as the whole Man has the Attributes both of <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> given to him, so the whole in our
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65543:9"/>
Saviour may also have the Attributes both of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man</hi> given to him. And this is as true an Union, as is that between Soul and Body; only whereas the <hi>Body</hi> gives sensations of Pain and Pleasure to the <hi>Mind,</hi> by vertue of the Union between them, the perfection of the Divine Nature is such, that it can receive no reciprocal Returns from the Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; though it does immediately and constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly act upon and conduct it.</p>
            <p>I do not pretend, that this does fully explain the <hi>Mystery,</hi> but it brings it nearer to our Thoughts: So that if it does not help us to comprehend it clearly, yet it carries us so far toward it, that we perceive that it is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible: and that is all which is at present of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered at.</p>
            <p>There is somewhat in the Old Testament, that will also contribute to give us a more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct notion of this Mystery. There was a Mass of shining Matter that hovered over the <hi>Cherubims,</hi> which was wrapped about with a Cloud; and it sometimes broke through it, and gave Answers to the <hi>Israelites,</hi> when they consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<note place="margin">Exod. 40. 34, 38.</note> God by the High-Priests. This had at first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to the whole Nation, in the Wilderness, and rested on the top of the Tabernacle, and went before them in their March, and was the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65543:10"/>
lasting character of God's Presence among them. It was the standing Miracle of their Religion, which none of their Idolatrous Kings could ever disprove; and it continued among them till their Temple was destroyed by the <hi>Babylonians.</hi> Now this <hi>Cloud</hi> was called <hi>God's Face,</hi> his <hi>Glory,</hi> and <hi>the Light of his Countenance,</hi> and even <hi>God</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 80. 1, 2. 2 Kin. 29. 15. Psal. 99. 1.</note> himself. <hi>O thou that dwellest between the Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims, shew thy self, and shine forth.</hi> And yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was there any thing more carefully mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, than the diverting that People from every step that might have any tendency to Idolatry. So the true account of this Cloud's being so spoken of, is, That this Mass of pure and bright matter, as well as the thicker Cloud that was folded about it, must have been quickly dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated, according to the Laws of Motion, all Flame being quickly gone, if not fed by new Fewel; but that God by an act of his Power; kept it constantly in that fixed state, and did some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times make it break through the Cloud to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his mind to his People that consulted him. So by vertue of the constant impression that God made upon that matter, he was said to be in it; and by vertue of that, the Cloud is said to be GOD.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:65543:10"/>Now it was prophesied, that the Glory of the second Temple should be <hi>greater than the Glory of</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hag 2. 9.</note> 
               <hi>the first;</hi> and this Cloud, in which God was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, being the proper <hi>Glory</hi> of the first, and it being wanting in the second, a higher degree of <hi>Glory</hi> was God's not only acting upon, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in a Mass of dead matter; but his act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon and appearing in animated matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in a Man that had all the Principles and Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents of our Nature in him. And thus this <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery</hi> that <hi>God was manifest in the flesh,</hi> has nothing in it that can render it any way Incredible, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the Principles of Reason or Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, or from the discoveries that were made concerning God in the <hi>Old Testament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for another part of this <hi>Mystery,</hi> that our Saviour was born of a Virgin, that carries not any thing in it, which reason shews to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd or impossible. For all matter being uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, and only different by the figure and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into which it is put, as God did upon the first creation of matter, put it into what Form he pleased, he can still put any part of it, into what shape or motion he intends to Impress up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it: so that there is no difficulty in appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending how God could have formed the first Principles of our Saviour's Body in the Virgin. And it being necessary that the Author of so
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65543:11"/>
holy a Religion should be perfectly pure and holy, that he might be a perfect Pattern, and so recommend his Doctrine with the more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, it was suitable to this, that he should have none of those frailties in his Nature and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, which might have exposed him to the failings, into which the best Men that have their Natures vitiated with those ill Inclinations, are apt to fall. It is certain, that with the first Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of our Being, there are derived to us the Seeds of ill Dispositions, both of Body and Mind. Cronical Diseases, such as Gout and Stone, Folly and Madness, are thus derived; and tho' this is in some Instances more visible and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible than it is in others, yet as every Man has some particular feebleness, of which some Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples descend to those who derive their being from him, so in all Men this is sensible, that their Bodies and bodily Impressions grow too hard for their Minds, and do always struggle and often revolt against them. It was then suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble both to this Holy Religion, and to the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion unto which the Divine Nature assumed the Author of it, that he should be free from all that disorder; and therefore the matter from which he was to take his beginning, was to be so exactly rectified and purified, that there should be no Principle of ill Inclination in it: for we
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65543:11"/>
perceive that our Minds act so much the more perfectly, the more pure and clear, that our Bodies are: We grow as our Bodies ripen, to be another sort of Beings, than we were when we were first born; and a Distemper in our Brain, may so hide or disorder all our Ideas, that we may thereby become in a moment fit for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: nor shall it be a small part of our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness in another state, that our Bodies shall be highly rectified, and so our Minds must become both purer and sublimer when they shall dwell in Bodies of heavenly and exalted matter. Upon all this, it is plain, that as there is no ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity in believing that our Saviour's first Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples were formed by Miracle, so it was highly suitable to the design on which he was sent into the World, that his Body should be freed from all that disorder which follows the ordinary course of Nature.</p>
            <p>III. But yet after all this, it may still be said, why must things of this nature be required to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved of us? why was this Doctrine of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which is hard enough in practice, made so much the harder, by containing in it so many things which render it so difficult to be believed? And why were such prejudices laid in the way, both of <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> by making these Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines to be parts of our Faith, which seemed to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65543:12"/>
savour of their most absurd Fables, as if there were in the Godhead a descent from <hi>Father</hi> to <hi>Son<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> To all which this is to be answered, that as there was no Doctrine more ancient and sacred among the Philosophers, than this of Three in the Deity, which is well known to all that have well exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the matter, so nothing could more recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend a Religion, that was to meet with great oppositions both in the nature of Man, and from the Powers that were then in the World, than the great Dignity of the Author of it; and therefore, as he was brought into the World with so much Pomp, so many Prophesies go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before his Birth, and so many Miracles ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying it, a whole Nation being selected, out of which he was to descend, and a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being Instituted that was full of Types and Ceremonies that were to be accomplished in him, so God thought fit to vest him with all possible Glory; that so his Doctrine might not only have the more credit, but that all Men might be the more encouraged to come into it, and to continue in it, by the great Assistances and the mighty Protection that they were to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from One that was the <hi>Head of Angels:</hi> and was also <hi>the brightness of the Fathers Glory:</hi> and since it was necessary to draw Men to think seriously of Religion, by offering them a full and free Pardon
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65543:12"/>
of all past sins, it being in vain to press Men to come into any Religion, if they are told that by their sins they are already become miserable, past Recovery and Redemption; God therefore as he resolved to offer a Pardon in the Gospel, so thought fit to do it in such a manner, as should declare his hatred of sin, as well as his love to mankind; and therefore he so ordered it, that the Author of this Holy Religion after he had fully declared it to the World, should be seized on by wicked Men, and be by them cruelly put to death; in the suffering of which, as he offered himself up with all submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to the Will of God, and bore every thing with all imaginable patience; so he felt in his mind, the most unconceivable sense imaginable of the sins &amp; miseries of mankind, and of the offence done to God by sin, which raised in him the vastest Agonies pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible; all which concurring to make his Sufferings most exquisite, must have overset a human force, if it had not been supported from a higher Principle: And as it pleased God to accept this of him, as a Sacrifice for the sins of the World, and to Crown him in reward of it, not only with <hi>honour and glory,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

               <hi>but by giving him all power both in heaven and on earth;</hi> so he conferred on him, an Authority of giving eternal life to all that should believe on his Name; and receive his Holy Gospel, and live according to it: and therefore since the making mankind eternally
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65543:13"/>
happy, was a design of so high a Narure, it was suitable to so Glorious a Project, that the Person in and by whom all this should be wrought, should be raised up to the highest pitch of Glory pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.</p>
            <p>Thus though it is always a bold Question to ask, why were things so ordered by God? Since if they are declared to us by him, we ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, without any further enquiry, that they were ordered according to the best and most infallible Reason, even tho' we should not be able to find it out; yet here even we, can discern a great suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness in all these high Mysteries, to the great Design of God in this Holy Religion.</p>
            <p>IV. But yet in the next Place must be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that we ought never to be too easie in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving things, that seem hard Impositions on us; and that therefore there ought to be a degree of certainty and clearness in the Revelation of any such thing, that is proportioned to the weight and the extraordinary nature of that which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to us; for as in the common affairs of life, an ordinary degree of Evidence serves to persuade us of an ordinary thing; but if somewhat that is very much out of the way is told us, we then are in the right, not to believe it, till we find it is well attested to us; and that by a very good Authority. So in Divine matters such Precepts
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65543:13"/>
of Morality as agree with our Natures and the ends of human Society, may be easily received, as needing no extraordinary authority to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them to us; but if Doctrines that are more above us are laid upon us, we ought to examine well the authority upon which they rest, that so we may not become too easie a prey, to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that thinks to subdue us with the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the word <hi>Mystery.</hi> Since then that the acknowledging that One who as to all his outward appearance was a Man, like unto us, was also the true and the <hi>great God,</hi> or the <hi>Son of the living God,</hi> carries such an uncouth sound in it, that it na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally affrights and startles us, it is necessary that though the possibility of this has been already considered, yet that before we believe it, we be sure that it is a Truth, which is clearly revealed to us by God; for a thing of this kind must appear in the Scripture, if it is at all in it, with such an Evidence as must put it past all doubt; since it is not suitable to the design and ends of Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, that a thing which is both so dark and yet so important, as this must be acknowledged to be, should be revealed, so as to be proved only by Hints, Inferences, or some Passages that are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of a double meaning.</p>
            <p>Now in pursuance of this, we must observe two things; <hi>1st.</hi> That there is nothing which is more
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65543:14"/>
expresly forbid in the Scriptures, than the giving Divine Adoration to a Creature. Idolatry is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than the Worshipping those <hi>that by nature are</hi>
               <note place="margin">Galat 4. 8.</note> 
               <hi>not Gods;</hi> and even the Old Testament for all the Compliances that were in it, to sensible nature, yet allowed of nothing that looked like Idolatry; and this is much less to be imagined in the New, that carries Religion in all respects, to a higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Sublimity and Purity than the Old did: This then is to be laid down for a Principle, that nothing is proposed to us in the New Testament, as the proper Object of our Adoration, but God himself. In the next place, it is no less plain, that<note place="margin">Revel. 5. 8. Heb. 1. 6. Heb. 13. 15. John 14. 1. 2 Cor. 12. 8, 9.</note> all the Acts of Worship, such as Adoration, Prayer, Praises, Faith, and Confidence, and in a word, every Act by which we testifie our dependance on God, and our Homage to him, is declared to be due to <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> in the same words, in which it is said to be due to <hi>God</hi> himself; therefore when these two things are laid together, the result of both is, that either the New Testament is the most Inco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent and the worst composed Legend that ever was Writ, in which one main and essential Point is contradict by another, or that <hi>Iesus Christ must be truly God.</hi> It is certain, that he is either such, or we Christians that pay him Divine Adoration, in so ample a manner as we do, are the greatest Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters that ever were.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:65543:14"/>And as this is contained in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in express words, so the whole Doctrine that is revealed in it, was attested in so eminent and so indisputable a manner, as to leave no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to Infidelity; so many Prophecies concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in the Person of our Saviour to prove him the true <hi>Messias,</hi> promised to the Jews many A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges before; and so many Miracles appearing, first at his Birth, and afterwards in the whole course of his Life, but above all at his Death, his Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and Ascension.</p>
            <p>The Apostles published the History of all this soon after it was done, and mentioned many Circumstances that were involved in it; which, if false, might have been authentically over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown by the Jews, in whose Hands the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity was lodged at that time, and who had both Interest and Malice enough to set them on to make the Discovery. One part of the Story was such, that it is not possible to believe that it could have past upon the World if it was not true. The Apostles pretended, that after the Holy Ghost was poured out on them, they not only wrought Miracles, but had likewise the Gift of Tongues. Now this was such a thing, that if it was false, it was in the power of every one of any strange Nation, to make the Discovery, and by so doing, to overthrow the Credit of the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65543:15"/>
whole Gospel. We see, by what both <hi>Sueto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, Tacitus,</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi> have left to us, that the Christian Religion was soon spread up and down the World; and that both in <hi>Rome,</hi> and in remote Provinces, their Numbers and their Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims, made them to be very considerable. We also see, in the last of these, that he had strictly enquired into their Doctrine, their Worship, and their Course of Life, and had put some of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that were the Deaconesses in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, to the Torture, to draw from them a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of such things whereof they were accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: Yet he found nothing but a great probity of Manners, and a great steadiness in adhering to the Doctrine which was believed among them: Upon whose enquiry the Emperor or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered a stop to be put to the Persecution, that was then begun: So that this carries in it, not only an Apology for the Morals of Christians, but a proof of the Doctrines of Christianity; for it being so easy a thing to have confuted them, if these things which the Evangelists relate had been <hi>false,</hi> since they cannot be said to be <hi>cunningly devised Fables;</hi> we cannot conceive how it is possible that their Enemies, who were then the Governing Party, did not discover, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found them. Upon the whole Matter then it appears, that God did by a profusion of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65543:15"/>
if I may so speak, give this Divine Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine its first Authority and Credit in the World; and he continued to water what had been so planted, with a succession of miraculous Powers, which continued for some Ages in the Church, and to which the Fathers made most solemn Appeals, in the Apologies that they writ for their Religion; of which some were address'd to the Emperors, and others to the Senate of <hi>Rome.</hi> If these Things which they assert, and to which they appeal, had not been known to be certainly true, it is not easy to determine whether their madness in venturing upon such an Appeal, or the Heathens in not joining issue with them in it, was the greatest.</p>
            <p>And thus <hi>without Controversy, Great is the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of Godliness, or of the Christian Religion: God was manifest in the Flesh,</hi> that is, in the Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of our Saviour, in which he dwelt. He was also <hi>justified in the Spirit,</hi> that is, proved to be so, in the wonderful Evidences of the Divine Power, that were solemnly given in the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of it: He was <hi>seen of Angels,</hi> the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Host appearing visibly at his Nativity, and celebrating the Glory of it; <hi>preached unto the Gentiles</hi> by a company of poor illiterate Fisher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who went about with those mighty Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentials of the Gift of Tongues, and the Power
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65543:16"/>
of Miracles; attesting the Truth of what they themselves had seen, and known; upon whose Evidence <hi>he was believed on in the World, by the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> tho rejected by the <hi>Iews;</hi> who being pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed with false Prejudices concerning the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias,</hi> could not then receive an humble and a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering One, while they look'd for nothing but Triumphs and Conquests under him. But this loss was more than ballanced by the great Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> who tho they laboured under the Prejudices of their Education, and the more biassed Liberties which the Heathen Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on allowed them, yet did in great Numbers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce their Idolatry, and embrace a Religion that both obliged them to a great strictness of Life, and also exposed them to many present Sufferings, besides what the first Planters of it warned them of, concerning a Persecution that was quickly to overtake them. We see by <hi>Tacitus,</hi> what multitudes of them were in <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>Nero</hi>'s Time; and by <hi>Pliny,</hi> that almost all those of <hi>Bith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> and <hi>Pontus,</hi> both in <hi>Town</hi> and <hi>Country,</hi> were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Christian. And in conclusion, <hi>God</hi> thus made <hi>manifest,</hi> was <hi>received up into Glory;</hi> which either relates to his Ascension, when in the sight of his Apostles, while he was talking to them, and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing them, He was caught up, so that they beheld<note place="margin">Luke 24. 51. Acts 5. 9.</note> him <hi>ascending up into Heaven;</hi> or this <hi>received in</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:65543:16"/>
               <hi>Glory,</hi> for so it may be rendred, may relate to the glorious Instances of God's Power, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the first planting of Christianity: For, as a <hi>Cloud of Glory</hi> had appeared hovering over the Tabernacle, and leading the <hi>Israelites</hi> through the Wilderness, which gave the chief Authority to the Law of <hi>Moses;</hi> so in this first setling of our most Holy Faith, God seemed, as it were, to have made bare his Arm, and shewed the greatness of his Glory, as well as of his Power. Thus he appeared to St. <hi>Stephen</hi> at his Death, and to St. <hi>Paul</hi> at his Conversion; but above all, the wonderful Effusion of the Holy Ghost at <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecost,</hi> was such a declaration of his Glory, as far exceeded all that ever had appeared before or since.</p>
            <p>V. In the last place it remains to be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, how this is said to be a <hi>Mystery of Godliness:</hi> The word signifies true <hi>Piety,</hi> or the right way of worshipping God. So the meaning of this is, That the Wonders and Glories which appeared in the Person of Christ, and at the planting of his Gospel, are not only lofty Declarations of the Greatness and Power of God, and of the Truth of our Religion, upon which we are to value our Selves, and our Doctrines, but that they were all intended by God to give our Religion the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65543:17"/>
more Authority, that so it might have the more Efficacy upon us, for the reforming and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Lives: for all the use that we make of them besides, is only to boast, that we believe a Religion to which God has given <hi>a great deal of Credit,</hi> but to which we will give <hi>none at all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By <hi>Godliness</hi> is comprehended the having right Notions of God, the worshipping him suitably to these, and the framing our whole Lives ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to them: And therefore we treat this <hi>Mystery</hi> but as a sublime Cant, and not as a <hi>Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Godliness,</hi> unless it has these Effects on us. When our Minds are by this so possessed with a noble Idea of God and of his Attributes, that we adore his Power, we admire his Wisdom, and rejoice in his Goodness and Love: When we compare the Prophecies that went before, with their Accomplishment in our Saviour's Person; when we observe all the Circumstances of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that accompanied this Transaction; when from thence we form right Notions of the hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of Sin, and of the Purity of the Divine Nature, of his Justice as well as of his Mercy; and when from all these laid together, our Hearts become full of high and great Thoughts of God, which dwell upon us, and possess us, then we make it become to us a <hi>Mystery of Godliness</hi> indeed. Besides, when this leads us to a right Notion of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65543:17"/>
the Worship of God, as not consisting in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Pomp nor Glory, much less in proposing to our selves visible Objects of Worship, or in dressing it up, as if it were rather a sort of <hi>Opera,</hi> than the Worship of that God, who has in his Gospel revealed himself to be <hi>Spirit and Truth,</hi> and that he will be worshipped accordingly. When our Worship consists in humble Acts of confessing our own Sins, that needed such an Expiation, in earnest Prayers for a Share in all the Benefits of it, and in solemn Acknowledgments of the Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of it, and of all those Blessings which we are always to own as the Effects of it, flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to us through it: When these, I say, are our Thoughts and Exercises in the Worship of God, then does this become to us a <hi>Mystery of Godliness.</hi> And finally, when our Minds are so seasoned with it, that our whole Lives carry the Impressions of it upon them; when we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of departing from the Rules of it; when we are strict in observing them; when it appears that we highly value the Blessing of the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the Gospel, that we are sensible of the danger of losing it, and that we rejoice in it above all other things; and when the Honour of our Religion does so affect us, that we are wounded at Heart, when it falls under any Reproach or Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, but rejoice in all the Glory of it; when
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65543:18"/>
we feel a sensible Concern in the whole Body that professes it, and in all the Accidents that relate to it; then do we shew that we make this to be, that which truly it is, a <hi>Mystery of Godliness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if we are only proud of our Religion, and factious about it; if it neither works on our Hearts, nor reforms our Lives; if we grow neither the better nor the wiser for it; if on the contrary, it is only a Pretence to cover ill Designs, and a handle to manage Factions by; if it makes us think that we may compound by our Heat in point of Opinion, for our Coldness in true Piety, and that Orthodoxy will atone for Immorality; if we lay in fewel for our ill Nature from it; if we make use of it to serve every End, but that for which it was appointed of God; and in a word, if, instead of growing better by it, are really the worse for it: Then here is the most fatal reversing of the greatest Design that ever was.</p>
            <p>In order to the examining the Truth of all this, it is necessary for us to consider, what Impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have the various Scenes that we have seen, with relation to Religion, made upon us? How did our apprehensions of losing it affect us? Was it only with the sense of a Party, and the anger of thinking that we were depressed, and like to be ill used? Or did that Scene make us reflect on our Sins, that had rendred us unworthy of so great
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65543:18"/>
a Blessing, and that had brought us so near the danger of losing it: did we in all that time of Fear and Melancholly, turn to God, repent us of our Sins, and enter into solemn Vows of living more suitably to our Religion, if God should be so gracious as to restore it to us? Such a Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as this, had made our Deliverance prove a double Blessing to us.</p>
            <p>And how have we received it? has it been only with the joy of seeing our Enemies fall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, and of finding our selves now come in for a turn in the Advantages of Fortune? Does this serve only to lift us up upon our Success and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity, and to make us remember all Quarrels, and so gratify Passion and Revenge? Is our Ease and Abundance abused into Luxury and Vanity? Are our Hearts lifted up, or our Passions sharpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? and instead of parting with our old Sins, are we adding new ones to them? If our Hearts, when sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely asked by us, concerning all these things, tell us that they are but too true, then we need not wonder if we see a stand made in the course of those Blessings, which God has been holding forth to us, but that we have by our Sins not only stopt, but turned many of them to Curses. We ought in that case to ask our selves, <hi>what have we done?</hi> and <hi>wherein have we troubled</hi> Israel? It is but a Melancholly Comfort when a man is full of so
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65543:19"/>
sad a speculation, to think that man is so made, that it ever was, and ever will be so.</p>
            <p>When the Christian Religion in <hi>Constantine's</hi> time, became triumphant over all the Powers of Darkness, that had conspired its destruction, and that after many Cruel Persecutions, had set on foot the last, that was both the bloodiest and the longest of all that had gone before it; in which, for ten years together, the Sword had been made drunk with the <hi>blood of the Saints;</hi> and it was so firmly believed that the name of a Christian was extinguished, that Medals were struck to perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate the memory of that Performance; when, I say, the Christian Religion got out of all this, and had not only Edicts of Liberty in its favour, but was also cherished by the Kindness and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of Emperours; One should have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that a Society which had been so long in the fire, as they had been, must have come out of it freed from all its dross: and that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians from the remembrance of the former Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution, and the reflections on their present Ease, should have been so full of a sense, both of what they had escaped then, and what they enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that there should have been nothing to be found among them, but Churches full of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Clergy-men animated with Zeal, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians that were an honour to their Profession.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:65543:19"/>But how far was it from all this! Generally Ignorant and Vicious Men were promoted to their best and greatest Sees, who fell into most Extravagant Disputes concerning the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Privileges of their Episcopal Sees. In <hi>Africk</hi> a Breach arose upon no greater matter than this, Whether <hi>Cecilian,</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> was ordained by men that had, during the Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, denied the Faith, or not? This was of no great Consequence, if it had been true; and being a matter of fact that turned upon proof, the case was judged against <hi>Donatus,</hi> and his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who complained of <hi>Cecilian:</hi> but this did not stop the Breach, which made such a fatal progress, that almost in every Town in <hi>Africk</hi> there was a Church formed with a Bishop over it, that adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to <hi>Donatus:</hi> and the Division continued above 120 years, and at last grew to be a matter of so violent an Animosity, that much Blood was shed upon it: and they continued to be destroying one another, till the <hi>Vandals</hi> broke in upon them, and conquered, and consumed them both.</p>
            <p>At the same time that this Dispute began at <hi>Carthage,</hi> another was raised at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned at first by some indiscreet Words that pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed between <hi>Alexander</hi> the Bishop, and <hi>Arius;</hi> whose Spirits being sharpned against one another upon secret Reasons, they aggravated some mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65543:20"/>
Expressions too far: as appears from the wisest Writing of that Age, the Letter which <hi>Constantine</hi> writ to them upon this Occasion: But this was carried afterwards so far, that we may safely say the Spirit and Power of the Christian Religion was lost in the Dispute. The Scandals given by the ill Lives, not only of Lay Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, but even of the chief Bishops of the Church, and those no less Scandalous Disputes among them, brought much Shame and Infamy on that holy Profession: which will ever suffer, when those who pretend to it, are a reproach to it.</p>
            <p>In Conclusion, after a whole Age of God's long-suffering Patience and Forbearance, there fell on the Church, both in the <hi>East,</hi> and in the <hi>West,</hi> a succession of the terriblest Plagues for two Ages together, that is in History: One Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour coming after another, and wasting what the former had left. And these brought on such Famines and Pestilences upon the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, that all the History of those Ages is a continued Scene of Horror and Misery.</p>
            <p>These are speaking things, and are set before us for our Terror, as well as for our Instruction; to let us see what we ought to look for, it not warned by such Terrible Examples, we should still continue to despise all the Methods of God's Providence, as well the severity of his
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65543:20"/>
Judgments, as his Long-suffering Patience, and Forbearance towards us.</p>
            <p>If any had observed the Constancy and Zeal that appeared in this Nation, for some years last past, when we saw our Religion in danger, and that scarce any could be prevailed on, so much as to give way, much less, to concur or comply with the Designs that were then on foot; from thence, one that saw the matter at a distance, would have been tempted to think that we were full of Zeal for our Religion, since neither Hope nor Fear could work on any consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Number among us; and from thence one might have been led to conclude, That if God should have delivered us from all that Danger, with a high and uplifted hand, and should have prevented even our Hopes and Wishes, in giving us such a quick and cheap Deliverance, as is without Example in History; That at least all People should have received this with all possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Acknowledgments; and that upon it, we should all have considered, what were the causes of our late Dangers, that threw us into them; and that we should have agreed in this, That our Divisions had been from the beginning to the end, the chief Foundation of all our Enemies hopes; that they had been set on, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged by them in order to our Ruin; that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:65543:21"/>
made our publick Councils so slow and feeble, and that nothing did so violently di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract the Minds of the People, as to see us so broken among our selves, especially in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion; and that we should have stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died to have healed all differences among our selves; and in Conclusion, that the Effects of so great a Revolution, should have been a visible Reformation among all Ranks and Conditions of People.</p>
            <p>But what shall be said, if all this Change of Affairs, has produced no other Change among us, but for the worse? If we are as bad as ever in all respects; if Vices of all sorts have still their free course among us; and if those Animorsities which were generally looked on for some years, as forgot and extinct<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are now revived with a new and greater heat; and if different Sentiments, whether with Relation to Sacred, or to Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Concerns, should now disturb us in so unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable a time, when the Eyes of all the World are upon us, and that all <hi>Europe</hi> expects from hence, a Deliverance from a Tyranny, which has now lain so long and so heavy on it. All these things are sad Indications of our great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency in the Matters of Religion; that after all the talk that has been about them, we either believe them not, or at least, consider them not
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:65543:21"/>
to be as they are indeed, the most valuable of all things. But let the World think of these things as they please, in them we see the <hi>Power, and the Wisdom of God:</hi> And as Morality without Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, will be found to be but a feeble Principle; and such as will only constrain a Man to follow his Interests, or at least his Pride, which in that Language, is called <hi>Honour;</hi> so Religion in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, unless it is grounded on a Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, will not have strength enough to hold, or govern a Man, it not having foundation enough for much Weight to be laid on it: and therefore here is a short Resolution of a good Man's Principles. He is persuaded that God sent down this Divine Person into the World, to declare to us the Will of God; and upon our following it, to assure us of the Pardon of Sin, of the Favour of God, and of Eternal Happiness. Next upon his believing these things, he sets himself to the serious performance of all that is commanded him by God; in doing which, he finds great inward joy in himself, since a mind reduced to a calm and quiet state, will feel as real a Complacency in all that is good, as the Eye feels in Light, or the Ear in Musick; from this arises in a good Man, a secret Confidence in God; for as he feels that he is conforming him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to his Will, so he grows assured of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:65543:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and Love of that infinitely good God; out of that there springs in a good mind, a perpetual source of Joy; he is walking with God, and ever delighting himself in him; and this Joy goes far beyond Life, and all that is present; it shoots out into another World, and gives him both a prospect of Eternity, and also some ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nests of it. This is the state of a truly Godly Man, he feels himself happy, but rejoyces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he believes he shall be infinitely more so, when he shall be in a state where he shall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly comprehend that, which is now to him the <hi>great Mystery of Godliness;</hi> To which State, God of his infinite Mercy bring us, through Jesus Christ our Lord. <hi>Amen.</hi>
