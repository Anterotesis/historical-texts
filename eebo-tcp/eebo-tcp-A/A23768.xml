            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the publishing this
Discourse, I might
reasonably think, would be to
<hi>libel your judgement;</hi> and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixing
your <hi>Name</hi> to it, and this

like <hi>revenge</hi> then <hi>homage</hi> or
<pb facs="tcp:62368:3"/>
               <hi>obedience:</hi> if I did not know that
<hi>low</hi> performances are due to
the transcendency of such a

And the truth is, my Lord, it

sollicitous to avoid your injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,

the unusefulness of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
it self.</p>
            <p>When God's most signal me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
of all sorts do not seem

when neither our own
dismal guilts, nor miseries, nor

               <q>Afterward shall the children of Israel return,
and seek the Lord their God, and David
their King, and shall fear the Lord and his
goodness.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>E had said in the words
before, that <hi>the children of
Israel shall abide many daies
without a King and without
a Prince, without a sacrifice
and without an image</hi> or <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
and without an Ephod and without Tera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phim.</hi>
Now when they shall have been
for many years in such a state of helpless
desolation, shall have <hi>no King</hi> under whose
shadow <hi>they,</hi> their <hi>laws</hi> and <hi>rights</hi> might
hope for shelter; <hi>no Prince</hi> to guard them
from the sad calamities of wild confusion
or usurping violence; shall have <hi>no exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises
of religion</hi> to allay and soften those ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities,
and give them comfort in the
bearing of them; <hi>no Altar</hi> to lay hold on
for security against them, or to stretch out
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62368:5"/>
their hands towards, for deprecation of
them; <hi>no</hi> nor a <hi>God</hi> to put an end to this
sad state; nor any <hi>means of direction</hi> what
to doe under it, <hi>no Ephod</hi> to ask counsel
at; nor yet the <hi>pageantry,</hi> the <hi>fallacy</hi> of
these, <hi>no Teraphim</hi> for <hi>Ephods,</hi> nor <hi>Image</hi> for
a <hi>God;</hi> the same destruction having sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
<hi>these</hi> and their <hi>worshippers,</hi> the <hi>people</hi> and
their <hi>Idols</hi> going into Captivity together,
and the <hi>onely true God</hi> having forsaken
them: Now when the <hi>Prophet</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd
this state of Woe, which was to
dwell with them so long as that their very
expectations of deliverance should be dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
having continued <hi>threescore</hi> years and
<hi>ten,</hi> a longer and more wearisome age of
<hi>patience</hi> then <hi>life,</hi> he then proceeds to swee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
all by telling them of a <hi>return,</hi> and
what things they shall doe in it; and they
are three.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>Seek the Lord their God,</hi> apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to his Worship and Obedience, and
cleave to him; for so the word is rendred
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. 31. and <hi>Ieremy</hi> repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
this c. 30. 9. words it, <hi>shall serve the
Lord their God, and David their King:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:62368:5"/>
Which is the <hi>second</hi> thing they were to
doe. As the <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> state was to be
setled, so the <hi>secular</hi> too upon its just foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations:
<hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Loaylty</hi> both running
in their ancient current.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>They shall fear the Lord and his
goodness:</hi> not onely tremble before him,
who is the <hi>Lord,</hi> that did exert his power
in their destruction; but shall much more
revere his <hi>goodness,</hi> that did flow out in
such plentiful miraculous expresses of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance,</p>
            <p>Now these being not onely <hi>prophecy</hi>
what in that juncture they would doe, nor
onely <hi>duties</hi> what they were to doe, but
also <hi>counsels</hi> and <hi>directions</hi> immediately
from <hi>God</hi> what they were best to doe, the
onely prudent and safe course according
to the policies of heaven; the direct view
of these particulars in reference to that
state of theirs is not an unconcerning pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
at this season, which is the <hi>Anniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary</hi>
of an equal return; and therefore I
shall lay them so before you, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion
on them in our practice shall make
the application.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:62368:6"/>
1. <hi>They shall seek the Lord their God</hi> is my
first part, and the Lord's prime direction
for the repairing of a broken Nation. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
indeed can any other course be taken;
for till we have found him, while he
does <hi>hide his face,</hi> nothing but <hi>darkness</hi>
dwells upon the land; or if any <hi>light</hi> do
break out, 'tis but the <hi>kindlings</hi> of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger:
so he expresses, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31. 17. <hi>This people
will forsake me and break my Covenant; then my
anger shall be kindled against them, and I will
forsake them, and hide my face from them, and
they shall be devoured, and many evils and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
shall befall them, so that they will say in that
day, Are not these evils come upon us because
our God is not amongst us?</hi> This absence is
onely another word for <hi>desolation: Be thou
instructed, ô Ierusalem,</hi> saith God by <hi>Ieremy,</hi>
c. 6. 8. <hi>lest my sould depart from thee, and I make
thee desolate, a land not inhabited:</hi> As if with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
him there were nothing else but soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
in Cities and in Courts, and all were
desert where he does not dwell. Yea there
is something beyond desolation, <hi>Hos.</hi> 9.
11, 12. <hi>As for Ephraim, their glory shall flee
away like a bird from the birth and from the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62368:6"/>
womb, and from the conception: though they
bring up their children, yet will I bereave them
that there shall not be a man, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> yea
wo also to them when I depart from them.</hi> And it
must needs be so; for let our state be never
so calamitous, if <hi>God</hi> be <hi>not departed,</hi> there is
<hi>comfort</hi> in it, and a <hi>deliverer</hi> at hand: If
we are <hi>in the place of dragons,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 44. 19.</note> his presence
will make <hi>heaven</hi> there; and although we
be <hi>covered with the shadow of death,</hi> if the
light of his Countenance break in, we are
in <hi>glory;</hi> and the brightness of that will
soon damp and shine out the <hi>fiery trial.</hi>
But if the <hi>Lord depart,</hi> then there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
possible: <hi>God hath forsaken him,
persecute him and take him, for there is none to
deliver him,</hi> Psa. 71. 11. But if there were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
some other way, yet the want of
<hi>God's presence</hi> is an evil, such as nothing in
the whole world can make good: the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of an <hi>angel</hi> in his stead does not.
When the Lord said to <hi>Israel, I will not go up
in the midst of thee, but I will send an Angel with
thee, and drive out the Amorite, the Hittite,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>yet when the people heard these evil tidings, they
mourned, and no man did put on his Ornaments,</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:62368:7"/>
Exod. 33. 4. Nay more, I shall not speak a
<hi>contradiction</hi> if I shall say, that the most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
presence of the <hi>Godhead</hi> does not sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
God's absence; and such a small with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing
of himself as may consist with
being <hi>united hypostatically,</hi> was too much for
him to bear who was <hi>Immanuel,</hi> when he
complained <hi>God was not with him:</hi> I mean our
<hi>Saviour</hi> on the Cross. <hi>He,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 22. 44.</note> who although
he did beseech against his cup with fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vencies

expostulate with him,<note place="margin">Mat. 27. 46.</note> crying out, <hi>My God,
my God, why hast thou forsaken me? His God</hi>
could no more <hi>forsake him,</hi> then <hi>himself</hi>
could be <hi>not himself:</hi> and yet the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of that which could not be was

could be insufferable. He seems to
feel a very contradiction while he but
seems to feel the want of the <hi>Lord's presence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such is the sad importance of <hi>God's not
being with us;</hi> and this same instance tells
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62368:7"/>
us what drives him away. 'Twas <hi>sin</hi> that
he withdrew from then: <hi>Christ</hi> did but
take on him our guilt, and upon that the
<hi>Lord forsook</hi> him: God could no more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
to behold wickedness in him, then
the Sun could to see God suffer;<note place="margin">Mat. 27. 45.</note> Iniquity
eclips'd them both, and sin did separate
betwixt him and himself, and made that
person who was <hi>God</hi> cry out, <hi>My God, my
God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> And it will
doe the same betwixt God and a people.
Isa. 59. 1, 2. <hi>Behold, the Lord's hand is not
shortned that it cannot save, nor his ear heavy
that it cannot hear; but your iniquities have
separated between you and your God, and your
sins have hid his face from you, that he will not
hear.</hi> His <hi>face</hi> is clothed with <hi>light,</hi> we
know; but when Wickedness over-spreads
a people, those <hi>deeds of darkness</hi> put out the
<hi>light of his countenance.</hi> His <hi>hand</hi> although
it be not <hi>shortned,</hi> yet it <hi>contracts</hi> and <hi>shuts</hi>
it self, not onely to grasp and withhold his
mercies from them, but to smite: Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
builds such a <hi>wall of separation</hi> as does
shut out <hi>omnipresence,</hi> and makes him who
is every where, not be with such a people;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62368:8"/>
not be in hearing of their needs; for when
their sins do cry, no prayers can be heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to; <hi>he will not hear you,</hi> saith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.

But 'tis not only upon these <hi>Analogies</hi> I build
this method of departure; we shall finde
exactly in <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Vision of that case to
which my Text referres: it begins chap. 9. 3.
<hi>And the glory of the God of Isreal</hi> (i.e. the <hi>shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
cloud,</hi> the token of his <hi>presence</hi> in the
<hi>Sanctuary,) went up from the Cherub whereupon
he was, to the threshold of the House,</hi> as going
out; and then ver. 8. he does refuse to be
entreated for the land: after that ch. 10.
18. <hi>The glory went from off the threshold to
the midst of the City;</hi> and chap. 11. 23. it <hi>went</hi>
from thence <hi>to the mountain without the City,</hi>
and so away: And then nothing but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation
dwelt upon the land, until the
counsel of my Text was followed, and
they did <hi>seek the Lord their God:</hi> for then
the <hi>glory</hi> did return into the Sanctuary just
as it went away, as you may find it ch. 43.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:62368:9"/>
And having seen <hi>when</hi> and <hi>how</hi> God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sakes
a people, and <hi>for what,</hi> that does di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
us <hi>how</hi> to <hi>seek him,</hi> and it is thus;
When men forsake those paths in which
they did not onely <hi>erre</hi> and <hi>goe astray,</hi> but
did <hi>walk contrary to God,</hi> so that they did
forsake each other; and do <hi>return, walk in
his waies,</hi> the <hi>waies of his Commandments,</hi> and
return also to his <hi>Church,</hi> and seek him in
his <hi>house,</hi> fall low before his <hi>footstool,</hi> begge
of him to meet in his <hi>tabernacle,</hi> renew his
<hi>Worship,</hi> and all invitations of him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
into his <hi>dwelling-place.</hi> For sure as it
is in vain to seek him but in his <hi>own waies,</hi>
nor can we hope to meet him but in his
<hi>Tabernacle of meeting;</hi> so also Scripture calls
both these to <hi>seek the Lord,</hi> and promises
to both the <hi>finding him.</hi> To the first, <hi>Deut.</hi>
4. 29, 30. <hi>If from thy tribulation thou shalt seek
the Lord thy God, thou shalt find him, if thou
seek him with all thy heart, and with all thy soul,
if thou turn to the Lord thy God, and shalt be
obedient unto his voice.</hi> And to the second,
<hi>Ier.</hi> 29. 12. speaking of this sad state to
which my Text relates, <hi>Then shall ye call
upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me; and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62368:9"/>
I will hearken unto you, and I will be found of
you, saith the Lord, and I will turn away your
captivity.</hi> I could produce you instances
of <hi>Asa</hi> making <hi>all his people swear to seek the
Lord:</hi> but because my Text speaks of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
he shall be the great <hi>explication,</hi> as he
was the <hi>practice</hi> of this duty in both sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
In the former, 119. Psal. <hi>I have sought
thy Commandments above gold or precious stone;</hi>
more then that which does <hi>make</hi> and does
<hi>adorn</hi> my <hi>Crown,</hi> then that which furnishes
all the <hi>necessities</hi> and all the <hi>pomps</hi> of <hi>Royalty.</hi>
And for the other, Psal. 63. 1, 2. <hi>O God, thou
art my God, early will I seek thee: my soul thirst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry
and thirsty land where no water is: To see thy
power and thy glory, as I have seen thee in the
Sanctuary.</hi> His very <hi>words</hi> do seem to <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour</hi>
too, and he does <hi>seek expressions</hi> to tell
us <hi>how</hi> he <hi>seeks.</hi> The <hi>hot fits</hi> of a thirsty
palate that call so oft and so impetuously
are in his <hi>soul;</hi> it hath a <hi>pious fever,</hi> which
cannot be allay'd but by <hi>pouring out of his
soul</hi> to God in the Temple, by <hi>breathing</hi> out
its heats in his <hi>devotion offices.</hi> Nay more,
<hi>he longs,</hi> hath that I know not whether <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite,</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:62368:10"/>
or <hi>passion,</hi> which is not to be <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,</hi>
but onely <hi>suffered;</hi> to which all the
<hi>unreasonable violences</hi> which passion can be
heated into, all the <hi>defaillances</hi> nature can be
opprest into, are <hi>natural;</hi> it is the <hi>bodies Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasie.</hi>
Now this he had towards the <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi>
of the <hi>Sanctuary;</hi> his very <hi>flesh</hi> found
rapture in those exercises, and when he was
in <hi>a barren and dry land,</hi> was driven from
the <hi>plenties</hi> of a Court, and from the <hi>glories</hi>
of a throne into a <hi>desert solitude,</hi> he found
no other wants but of <hi>God's house;</hi> did
<hi>mind, pant,</hi> and <hi>long after</hi> nothing else, did
neither thirst for his <hi>necessities,</hi> nor long for
his <hi>own Crown,</hi> but for the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> only.
And besides the <hi>Religion</hi> of this, he had <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of State</hi> too to be thus affected; this
was the best means to engage his Subjects
to him and secure his Throne. He knew, if
by <hi>establishing God's worship</hi> and by <hi>going with
the multitude,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 42. 4.</note> as he did use, to the exercises
of it; if by <hi>royal example</hi> and <hi>encouragements</hi>
of vertue, and by <hi>discountenancing</hi> and <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stising</hi>
impiety, by doing as he did profess
to doe Ps. 101. (that <hi>directory for a Court</hi>)
he could people his <hi>land</hi> with <hi>holy living,</hi> and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62368:10"/>
his <hi>Temple</hi> with <hi>holy-Worship;</hi> he knew he
should then have good Subjects, <hi>loyal</hi> to
him and <hi>at peace</hi> with themselves. If they
will <hi>seek their God,</hi> then they will <hi>seek their
King.</hi> The Lord saw this dependence,
and therefore counselled this course should
be taken. The <hi>Master of our Politicks</hi> discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
it too,<note place="margin">Arist. Pol. l. 7.</note> and therefore does advise that
the first and chiefest publick cares should
be about <hi>things of Religion,</hi> that and the same
profession of it being <gap reason="foreign">

<hi>the cement of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities,

and indeed all power</hi> in the Magistrate:

<hi>To have one
and the same opinions of God, and not to differ
in their rites from one another, breeds the best
harmony in mens affections.</hi> When on the
other side no obligations, though the most
<hi>signal</hi> and <hi>divine,</hi> will hold them in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62368:11"/>
and peace, if their <hi>ambitions</hi> or <hi>inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests</hi>
look another way: and if at any time
<hi>present advantage,</hi> or an <hi>expectation,</hi> or some
<hi>passion</hi> do encline them to <hi>seek David their
King;</hi> yet the appearance of a <hi>change</hi> of
Interest, that expectation <hi>defeated,</hi> or a
<hi>cross animosity</hi> will burst those bonds, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
<hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Communion in Worship</hi> help
to twist them. <hi>David</hi> had had experience
of this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Abner</hi> knew of <hi>God's oath</hi> to <hi>David</hi> that
after <hi>Saul</hi> he should be <hi>King over all Israel;</hi>
but he was otherwise concerned, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he made <hi>Ishbosheth</hi> King, maintained
a long and a sore warre even against what
he knew God was engaged to bring about,
and <hi>made himself strong for the house of Saul,</hi>
2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2, 3. ch. But when a <hi>quarrel</hi> happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
betwixt <hi>Ishbosheth</hi> and <hi>him,</hi> then, <hi>So doe
God to Abner and more also, except as the Lord
hath sworn to David, even so I doe to him, to
set up the throne of David over Israel and over
Iudah. And he sent Messengers to him saying,
Whose is the land? make but thy league with
me.</hi> c. 3. 9, 10, 11, 12. Do but look forward,
and you find when <hi>Abner</hi> was cut off, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62368:11"/>
               <hi>Ishbosheth</hi> was slain, and <hi>Israel</hi> had no lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
then they <hi>came to David, saying, Behold,
we are thy bone and thy flesh, and the Lord said
to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel,</hi> c. 5. 1, 2.
They knew all that before, yet would not
let him doe it, till they had no other lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
Nay, when they had done that, by
<hi>Absalom</hi>'s insinuations (who in a way of
treacherous pity did instill dislikes against
the government, and did remonstrate in
<hi>good wishes,</hi> as some men do in <hi>prayers,</hi>
c. 15. 3, 4) they were all drawn into rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
against this <hi>David,</hi> and made him flie
out of the land, and became Subjects to
that <hi>Absalom.</hi> When he was dead indeed
they speak of <hi>bringing back the King,</hi> c. 19.
10. and when his own <hi>Iudah</hi> had done it,
quarrell'd ver. 43. because that <hi>their advice
was not first had:</hi> and though <hi>Iudah</hi> had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but their service, for, <hi>Have we eaten
at all of the Kings cost, or hath he given us any
gift?</hi> say they, ver. 42. yet <hi>Israel</hi> is angry, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he came not back upon their score,
for they forsooth <hi>have ten parts in him,</hi> v. 43.
and yet the next day every man of <hi>Israel</hi>
went after him that said, <hi>We have no part
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62368:12"/>
in David, Sheba a man of Belial,</hi> ch. 20. 1.
Thus no allegiance, no tie however sacred
and divine will hold them who follow
not upon God's score. Nay at the last, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that <hi>Rehoboam</hi> would not ease their
taxes,<note place="margin">1 Kings 12. 16.</note> all <hi>Israel</hi> cry out, <hi>What portion have we
in David? see to thine own house, David.</hi> And
to make this secession perpetual (which all
the former did not prove) <hi>Ieroboam</hi> did use
no other policy, but to <hi>change the Worship
and the Priests:</hi> He knew he should divide
their hearts and Nations for ever, when
he had altered once the Service and the
Officers; and if he could but keep them
from <hi>seeking God</hi> at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> he was secure
they would <hi>not seek David their King.</hi> And
so it proved. Now the Lord to prevent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
had provided so farre <hi>Uniformity</hi> in
his worship, that he required a single <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;</hi>
and that it might be but in <hi>one manner,</hi>
he let it be but in <hi>one place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And truly, when men once depart from
Uniformity, what measures can they set
themselves of changing? what shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
or put shores to them? what prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
can they proceed upon which shall
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62368:12"/>
engage them to stay any where? and why
may not divisions be as infinite as mens
phansies? And though, when those are
but in circumstantial things, those who
are strong, and know them to be such, are
no otherwise concerned to contend for
them then on <hi>Authorities</hi> behalf, (to which
every change is a <hi>Convulsion fitt,</hi>) and on
the account of decency, and of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
with the universal Church: yet
when others do <hi>dogmatize,</hi> and put <hi>consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
in the <hi>not doing</hi> them, and stand at such
a distance from them as to chuse <hi>Schisme,
Disobedience,</hi> and <hi>Sedition</hi> rather, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
must needs look upon <hi>damnation</hi> in
them; these differences make as great a
<hi>gulfe</hi> and <hi>chasme</hi> as that which does divide<note place="margin">Luk. 16. 26.</note>
               <hi>Dives</hi> from <hi>Abraham</hi>'s bosome. It is <hi>one
God, one Faith, one Worship</hi> makes <hi>hearts one.</hi>
Hands lifted up together in the Temple
they will joyn and clasp: and so <hi>Religion</hi>
does fulfill its name <hi>à religando,</hi> binds Prince
and Subjects all together; and they who
thus do <hi>seek the Lord their God,</hi> will also
<hi>seek David their King,</hi> God's next direction,

            </p>
            <p>I am not here to read a Lecture of State
policy upon a vie of Governments; why
seek <hi>a King,</hi> not any other sort of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and why <hi>their King,</hi> one that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
was so by the right of <hi>Succession,</hi> not
whom <hi>addresses</hi> or <hi>election</hi> should make so.
And though I think 'twere easie to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate

and uneasie consequences, and this
so much to sight, that choice for the most

of <hi>Succession:</hi> yet this I need not doe, for
I am dealing with the Jews, who had
God's judgement in the case, and his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
too; and to me that is argument
enough. And when God hath declar'd,<note place="margin">Prov. 28. 2.</note> 
               <hi>for
the transgressions of a land many are the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
thereof;</hi> many <hi>at once,</hi> as in a <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,</hi>
or many <hi>several families</hi> successively,
for so God reckons also one or many; 'tis

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62368:13"/>
               <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>line,</hi> and so the <hi>King</hi> does truly <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
die,</hi> while his race lives. If either of
these <hi>many</hi> be God's punishment, for the
sins of a land, I will not say that they who
love the <hi>many Princes</hi> love the <hi>transgressions</hi>
which God plagues so; but I will say,
they who do <hi>chuse</hi> that which God calls
his <hi>plague,</hi> that <hi>quarrel</hi> for his <hi>vengeance,</hi>
and with great strife and hazard <hi>take his
indignation by force,</hi> I can but pity them in
their own options and enjoyments: but,
<hi>O my soul, enter not thou into their counsels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for <hi>seeking their King,</hi> I shall content

               <hi>Moses</hi> was the first <hi>King in Ieshurun,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 33. 5.</note> and
he was onely gone into the Mount for
forty daies,<note place="margin">Exo. 32. 1, 5.</note> and they set up a <hi>golden Calf;</hi>
they make themselves a God if they want
him whom the Lord makes so, as he does
the Magistrate: if they have not a <hi>Prince,</hi>
that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>living Image of God,</hi>
then they must have an <hi>Idol.</hi> When <hi>Moses</hi>
his next successor was dead, we read that
the man <hi>Micah had an house of Gods, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated
one of his sons to be his Priest:</hi> and
truly he might make his <hi>Priest</hi> who made
his <hi>Deities.</hi> And the account of this is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<hi>In those daies there was no King in Israel,
Iud.</hi> 17. 5, 6. The very same is said ch. 18. 1.
to preface the Idolatry of the Tribe of <hi>Dan.</hi>
There was <hi>no heir of restraint,</hi> as it is worded
ver. 7. It seems, to curb impiety is the
Princes Inheritance, which till it be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62368:14"/>
he hath not what he is heir to. But
Vice will know no boundaries if there be
no King, whose sword is the onely mound
and fence against it: for if we reade on
there, 19, 20, 21 ch. we shall find those
dismal tragedies of <hi>Lust</hi> and <hi>Warre,</hi> the one
of which did sin to death the Levites wife;
the other, besides 40000. slain of them
who had a righteous cause, and whom God
did bid fight, destroyed also a Tribe in
<hi>Israel:</hi> these all sprang from the same oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
for so the story closes it, <hi>In those
daies there was no King in Israel,</hi> ch. 21. 25.</p>
            <p>Just upon this, when God in their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities
did raise them <hi>Iudges,</hi> that is,
<hi>Kings,</hi> read all their story, you will find to
almost every several Judge there did suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
a several Idolatry: God still complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,<note place="margin">Judg. 3. 7. &amp; ver. 12.</note>
               <hi>the children of Israel did evil again after
the death</hi> of such an one, till he raised them
another.<note place="margin">Ch. 4. 1. Ch. 6. 1. Ch. 10. 6. Ch. 13. 1.</note> Those 450. years being divided
all betwixt their <hi>Princes</hi> and their <hi>Idols.</hi>
After them <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> he that made the
great secession of that people from their
Prince, hath got no other character from
God but this, the<note n="a" place="margin">1 Kings 16. 26. Ch. 21. 22. &amp; 22. 52, &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>Man that did make Israel
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62368:15"/>
to sin,</hi> at once against God and against their
King. Yea upon this account they are
reckon'd by God to sin after both their <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry</hi>
and <hi>State</hi> were ended, when their <hi>calves</hi>
and their <hi>Kingdome</hi> were destroyed. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 4.
4, 5. the Lord does bid the Prophet <hi>lie on
his left side</hi> 390. <hi>daies, to bear the iniquity of
Israel according to the number of the years of
their iniquity.</hi> But this was more then the
years of their <hi>State,</hi> which were onely 255.
390 years indeed there were betwixt the
<hi>falling off</hi> of the ten Tribes, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> by the King of <hi>Babel;</hi>
but those ten Tribes were gone, their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
perfectly destroy'd above 130. years
before: but their <hi>iniquity</hi> was not, it seems,
that does <hi>outlive</hi> their State, so long as that
<hi>God's Temple,</hi> that <hi>King's house</hi> did stand from
which they did divide. As if <hi>Seditious</hi> and
<hi>Schismaticks</hi> sin <hi>longer</hi> then they are, even
<hi>while</hi> they are whom they do sin against
in separating from.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, there was an <hi>Ahaz</hi> and <hi>Manasseh</hi>
in the house of <hi>David,</hi> but <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah</hi>
did succeed. Mischief did not appear
<hi>entail'd</hi> on <hi>Monarchy,</hi> as 'tis upon <hi>rebellion</hi> and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62368:15"/>
having <hi>no King.</hi> It does appear their Kings
were <hi>guards</hi> also to <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Religion,</hi>
the great <hi>defendors of his Faith</hi> and <hi>Worship.</hi>
God and the Prince for the most part <hi>stood</hi>
and <hi>fell</hi> together: Therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> did
afterwards advise <hi>to pray for Kings,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 2.</note> 
               <hi>that we
might live in godliness and honesty;</hi> and still
they were the same who sought the <hi>Lord
their God, and David the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But why <hi>David their King?</hi> for could his
Kingdome disappear and be to seek, of
whom the Lord had said, <hi>I have sworn once
by my Holiness,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ver. 35.</note> 
               <hi>I will not fail David?</hi> Psal. 89.
And his Throne therefore was as <hi>sure</hi> as
God is <hi>holy.</hi> But yet the Lord had said to
the people of <hi>Israel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 12. 25.</note> 
               <hi>If ye doe wickedly, ye shall
be destroyed both you and your King.</hi> There are
other sins besides <hi>Rebellion</hi> and <hi>Treason</hi> that
<hi>murder</hi> Kings and Governments. Those
that support their Ills by their dependen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
and use great shadows for a shelter to
rapacity, oppression, or licences, or any cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wickedness; these prove Traitors to
<hi>Majesty</hi> and <hi>themselves,</hi> strike at the root of
that under which they took covert, fell that
and crush themselves. <hi>National</hi> vices have
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62368:16"/>
all <hi>Treason</hi> in them, and every <hi>combination</hi>
in such sins is a <hi>Conspiracy.</hi> If universal pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
palliate them, we do not see their
stain, it may be, think them slight; but
their complexion is <hi>purple: Common blood</hi> is
not deep enough to colour them, they die
themselves in that that's <hi>sacred.</hi> Nay these
do seem to spread contagion to <hi>God,</hi> as if
they would not let the Lord be <hi>holy,</hi> nor
suffer that to be which he <hi>swore</hi> by his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
should be: for the <hi>Psalmist</hi> cries out,
<hi>Where are thy old loving kindnesses which thou
swarest unto David?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 89. 49.</note> But sure <hi>some</hi> of God's
oaths will stand; if not those of his <hi>kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
those will by which he swears the <hi>ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine</hi>
of such sinners,<note place="margin">Isa. 5. 16.</note> and <hi>God that is holy will
be sanctified in judgement upon them.</hi> Yea, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>more</hi> then the offenders, for the guilty
themselves are not a sacrifice <hi>equal</hi> to such
piacular offences. Innocent Majesty must
bleed for them too; <hi>If you doe wickedly, you
shall be destroy'd both you and your King.</hi> Thus
when God would <hi>remove Iudah out of his
sight,</hi> good <hi>Iosiah</hi> must fall; and the same
makes them be to <hi>seek David their King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how <hi>David their King,</hi> when 'twas
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62368:16"/>
               <hi>Zorobabel?</hi> for with <hi>Theophylact</hi> and <hi>others</hi>
I conclude he must be meant in the first
literal importance of the words.</p>
            <p>It was the custome of most Nations
from some great eminent Prince to name
all the Succession, so at once to suggest his
Excellencies to his followers, and to make
his glory live. Now without doubt <hi>David</hi>
was <hi>Heroe</hi> enough for this, and his valour
alone sufficient to ground the like pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
upon. And though we do not find
that done, yet we do find his <hi>piety</hi> and his
<hi>uprightness</hi> made the <hi>standard</hi> by which that
of his Successors is meted. Of one 'tis said
<hi>he walked in the waies of David his father;</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Chro. 34. 2.</note> of
another, <hi>he did that which was right in the
sight of the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 King. 14. 3.</note> 
               <hi>but not like unto David his
father.</hi> And because <hi>David</hi> went aside, and
was <hi>upright</hi> with an <hi>Exception,</hi> once there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is said,<note place="margin">2 Chro. 17. 3.</note> 
               <hi>The Lord was with Iehoshaphat,
because he walkt in the first waies of his father
David.</hi> But besides this, his very name is
given to two, <hi>Zorobabel,</hi> and the <hi>Messiah;</hi>
both which were to be the <hi>restorers</hi> of their
people: the one from <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Hell,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>establish
the <hi>Kingdome of heaven</hi> it self; the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62368:17"/>
other to deliver his people from <hi>Babel,</hi> and
to repair a <hi>broken Nation</hi> and <hi>demolish'd Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi>
And for this work God bids them <hi>seek
David their King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The waies from <hi>Babel</hi> to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> from
the <hi>Confusion</hi> of a people to a <hi>City that is at
unity in it self,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 122. 3, 5.</note> 
               <hi>the City of God where he appears
in perfect beauty,</hi> and <hi>where the throne of the
house of David is,</hi> must be the <hi>first waies of
David:</hi> in those he walk'd to <hi>Sion,</hi> and did
invest his people in <hi>God's promises,</hi> the whole
<hi>land of Canaan.</hi> In those <hi>Zorobabel</hi> brought
them back to that <hi>land</hi> and <hi>Sion.</hi> And in
these our <hi>Messiah</hi> leads us to <hi>Mount Sion
that is above,</hi> to the <hi>celestial Ierusalem;</hi> does
build an <hi>universal Church</hi> and <hi>heaven it self.</hi>
And all that have the like to doe must
walk in those <hi>first waies,</hi> fulfill that part of
<hi>David,</hi> and must copy <hi>Christ.</hi> Such the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairers
of great breaches must be: these
are the waies to settle Thrones, the onely
waies in which we may find the <hi>goodness
of the Lord;</hi> which to <hi>fear</hi> is the third di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
and my last part.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They shall fear the Lord and his goodness.</hi>
3. That <hi>Israel</hi> who came but now out
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62368:17"/>
of the <hi>furnace</hi> should fear the Lord whose
wrath did <hi>kindle</hi> it, whose <hi>justice</hi> they had
found such a <hi>consuming fire</hi> as to make the
<hi>Temple</hi> it self a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and the whole
<hi>Nation</hi> a <hi>burnt-offering,</hi> is reasonable to
expect: but when his <hi>goodness</hi> had <hi>repair'd</hi>
all this, to require them to <hi>fear</hi> that, does
seem hard. That that <hi>goodness,</hi> which
when it is once apprehended does com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
a rape upon our faculties, and being
tasted melts the heart, and causes dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of soul through swoons of compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
that this should be received with
<hi>dread</hi> and <hi>trembling,</hi> is most strange. Indeed
the Psalmist saies,<note place="margin">Psal. 130. 4.</note> 
               <hi>There is mercy with God
that he may be feared;</hi> for were there not,
we should grow <hi>desperate:</hi> but <hi>how</hi> to fear
those mercies is not easie. 'Tis true, when
God made his <hi>goodness</hi> pass before <hi>Moses,</hi>
shewed him the <hi>glory</hi> of it, as he saies,
in those most comfortable attributes, the
sight of which is <hi>beatifick Vision,</hi> Exod. 34.
6, &amp;c. <hi>The Lord, the Lord God merciful and
gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and truth, keeping mercy for thousands,
forgiving iniquity, transgression and sin;</hi> if that
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62368:18"/>
which follows there be part of it, <hi>forgiving
sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty,
visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the
children unto the third and fourth generation;</hi>
if this be one <hi>ray</hi> of the <hi>glory</hi> of goodness,
if it dart out such beams, alas, 'tis as <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring</hi>
as the <hi>lake of fire,</hi> his very <hi>goodness
stabs</hi> whole successions at once, and the
guilty may tremble at it for themselves
and their posterity. But if those words
doe mean as we translate those very
words,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               <hi>Ier.</hi> 46. 28. <hi>I will not leave thee alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
unpunish'd, yet will not utterly cut off,</hi>
not make a <hi>full end</hi> of the guilty, when I
visit iniquities upon the children, but will
leave them a <hi>remnant</hi> still; then there is
nothing dreadful in it, but those very vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitations
have kindness in them, and his
rod comforts, and this issue of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
also is not terrible but lovely. To
<hi>fear God's goodness</hi> therefore is to <hi>revere</hi> it,
to entertain it with a <hi>pious astonishment,</hi>
acknowledging themselves unworthy of
the crums of it, especially not daring to
provoke it by <hi>surfeting,</hi> or by <hi>presuming</hi> on
it, or by <hi>abusing</hi> it to serve <hi>ill ends,</hi> or any
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62368:18"/>
               <hi>other</hi> then God sent it for, those of <hi>piety</hi>
and <hi>obedience:</hi> not to comply with which,
is to <hi>defeat</hi> God's kindness, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
of it. If when they <hi>sought</hi> the Lord,
he was <hi>found</hi> of them, and came to his
dwelling-place onely to be <hi>forc'd</hi> thence
again by their abominations; if when his
goodness had restor'd all to them, they
had <hi>David their King</hi> but to <hi>conspire</hi> against,
an <hi>Altar</hi> onely to <hi>pollute,</hi> and a <hi>Temple</hi> to
<hi>separate</hi> from, as <hi>Manasses</hi> the Priest, <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballat</hi>'s
son in law, with his accomplices
did doe; this were both to <hi>affront</hi> and to
<hi>renounce</hi> that goodness, which above all
things they must dread the doing: for if
this be offended too, ruine is irreversible;
there is no other attribute in God a sinner
can fly to with any hope. His <hi>Holiness</hi>
cannot <hi>behold iniquity,</hi> his <hi>Iustice</hi> speaks no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but <hi>condemnation</hi> to guilt, his <hi>Power</hi>
without kindness is but <hi>omnipotent destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;</hi>
but if we have his <hi>Goodness</hi> on our
side, we have an <hi>Advocate</hi> in his own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
that will bear up against the rest, for
<hi>his mercy is over all</hi> his <hi>attributes</hi> as well as
<hi>works:</hi> but if this also be exasperated,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62368:19"/>
and kindness grow severe, there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
in the Lord, no shadow of him to
take Sanctuary under; for there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to allay the <hi>anger</hi> of his <hi>Compassion</hi>
and <hi>Bounty.</hi> This sure is the extremest ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
we are to dread, his kindness <hi>more</hi>
then his severity and wrath; we have an
antidote, a buckler against these, but none
against the other if it be provok'd; and if
the <hi>heats of love</hi> take <hi>fire</hi> and rise into in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation,
'tis <hi>unquenchable flame</hi> and <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
burning.</hi> Therefore when God hath
done all things that he can doe or they
can wish, then most of all they must <hi>fear
the Lord and his goodness.</hi>

            <p>My <hi>Text</hi> and I have spoke all this while

was crumbled into so many, so mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute

while prosperous and happy Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

unpardonable crimes, to which nothing

all those guilts that make the <hi>last times

with all their dismal consequences and

all these did not onely walk in the dress
of piety, and under holy Masks, but were
themselves the very <hi>form of Godliness,</hi> by
which 'twas <hi>constituted</hi> and <hi>distinguished,</hi> the
<hi>Signature</hi> of a party of <hi>Saints,</hi> the <hi>Constella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of their <hi>graces:</hi> And on the other side,
the detestation of such hypocrisie made
others <hi>Libertines</hi> and <hi>Atheists;</hi> while seeing
men such holy counterfeits, so violent in
acting, and equally engag'd for every false
Religion, made them conclude there was
none true, or in earnest. And all this was
because we were <hi>without our King;</hi> for 'twas
the onely Interest of all those <hi>usurpations</hi>
that were to contrive and preserve it thus.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62368:20"/>
And when we had <hi>roll'd</hi> thus through

him with the violent impatiences of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitous

did even fail with looking <hi>on him,</hi> as

without him 'twas impossible for us to

Providence out of the gaping jaws of
tyrannous, usurping, murtherous malice,
merely to <hi>keep</hi> him for <hi>our needs,</hi> and for
<hi>this day:</hi> One whom God had train'd up

<hi>David their King,</hi>

God had given him by <hi>Samuel</hi> about <hi>twelve</hi>
years before;<note place="margin">Inter 7 &amp; 9</note> and in those years to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
him for <hi>Canaan</hi> by a <hi>Wilderness,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sauli qui re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnavit an.</note> to
<hi>harden</hi> him with discipline,<note place="margin">20. Vid. Sim Chron.</note> that so the lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xuries
and the effeminacies of a Court
might not <hi>emasculate</hi> and <hi>melt</hi> him; by
constant Watches, cares and business, to
make him equal for, habituated to, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of, and affected with the business of
a Kingdome;<note place="margin">Psal. 120. 5.</note> and by <hi>constraining</hi> him to
<hi>dwell in Mesech,</hi> with Aliens to his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to teach him to be constant to his <hi>own,</hi>
and to <hi>love Sion.</hi> And hath he not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
<hi>our David</hi> so for us? and we hope
hath prepared for him too the <hi>first daies of
David,</hi> having no <hi>Sheba</hi> in the Field, nor
<hi>Achitophel</hi> in the Councel, nor an <hi>Abiathar</hi>
in the Temple, not in that Temple which
himself hath rais'd, God having made
him instrument of that which he would
not let <hi>David</hi> doe, <hi>building</hi> his <hi>house,</hi> and
<hi>furnishing</hi> it with all its <hi>Offices,</hi> and making
it fit for <hi>God</hi> to <hi>meet</hi> us in, when we do
<hi>seek him</hi> also, which was the other perquisite
of our Condition.</p>
            <p>There never was so much pretence of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62368:22"/>
               <hi>seeking God</hi> as in those late daies of his
absence from us; and it should seem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
we knew not where to <hi>find</hi> him, we
took such several waies to <hi>seek</hi> him. But if
God did look down from heaven then as
he did <hi>Psal.</hi> 14. to <hi>see if any did understand
and seek after God,</hi> should he not then have
found it <hi>here</hi> as <hi>there?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 14.</note> 
               <hi>They are altogether
gone out of the way;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 3.</note> 
               <hi>their throat is an open se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre,
with their tongues have they deceived,
the poison of asps is under their lips, their mouth
is full of cursing and bitterness, their feet are
swift to shed blood: destruction and unhappiness
is in their waies, and the way of peace have
they not known; there is no fear of God before
their eyes: They eat up my people as it were
bread;</hi> and, which is worse in <hi>these</hi> then
<hi>them, they even then call upon God,</hi> as if
they <hi>craved a blessing</hi> from the Lord upon
that <hi>meal</hi> that did <hi>devour his people;</hi> and
when they did <hi>seek God,</hi> they meant to
<hi>find a prey.</hi> Yet where were any <hi>others</hi>
that did seek him? or that do cleave to
him now? The <hi>Schismatick</hi> does not <hi>seek</hi>
God, who shuns the place where he <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,</hi>
and <hi>meets,</hi> and <hi>dwells;</hi> nor does he
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62368:22"/>
               <hi>cleave</hi> to God who <hi>tears</hi> himself off from
the Lord's body.<note place="margin">Rom. 16. 17.</note> 
               <hi>Mark such as cause divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,</hi>
saith S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>avoid them:</hi> and if
all Christians must <hi>avoid</hi> them, then I am
sure <hi>God is not with them.</hi> The <hi>other Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks</hi>
that divide from the World by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
off the World from them; do they
seek <hi>God</hi> that are diverted by so many
<hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels?</hi> that terminate divinest
Worship in a <hi>creature?</hi> or do they cleave to
<hi>God,</hi> when their devotion embraceth <hi>stocks</hi>
and <hi>stones?</hi> or did they <hi>seek God</hi> for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of my Text, who did not <hi>seek David
their King,</hi> but did apply themselves to seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>forein Princes,</hi> and to others which they
hoped would set up their <hi>Golden calf? Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaries,</hi>
that make fires and raise commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
these are farre from God;<note place="margin">1 Kings 19. 11, 12.</note> for <hi>the Lord
was not in the fire, or in the Earth-quake,</hi> but in
the <hi>still small voice,</hi> in the soft whispers of
peace and love. The <hi>Atheist,</hi> he that <hi>saies
in his heart there is no God,</hi> will not seek
God, you may be sure: nor does he care
to <hi>seek David his King,</hi> who is equally well
under all Governments that will allow his
licences, and who hath no Religion to tie
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62368:23"/>
him to any. If he at all dislik'd the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
it was upon reasons of <hi>burthen,</hi> or of
<hi>pride,</hi> or <hi>Libertinisme:</hi> so much Religion
though counterfeit was a reproach to him,
and the face of such strictness was uneasy
to him. These are so farre from seeking
God, that God saies <hi>these did drive him out of
Israel,</hi> Ezek. 9. 9. And then when that hath
so long been the <hi>Wit,</hi> that 'tis now the
<hi>Complexion</hi> of the Age, and they who
thought fit to shew their not being hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites
by <hi>license,</hi> and (to give it an easie
word) by <hi>drollery in sacred things,</hi> have now
made nothing to be sacred to them; how
shall the Lord dwell among such? they
are enough to <hi>exorcise</hi> God out of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The <hi>Hypocrite</hi> also, for all his <hi>Fasts</hi>
and <hi>Prayers,</hi> never did seek God, for he is
but a <hi>whited Sepulchre,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 23. 27.</note> our Saviour saies.
Now who would seek the <hi>living God</hi> among
the <hi>dead?</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>life</hi> sure is not to be
found in <hi>graves. Golgotha</hi> was a place to
<hi>crucifie</hi> him in, not <hi>worship</hi> him: he takes
not in the air of funeral Vaults for <hi>incense;</hi>
'twas a <hi>Demoniack</hi> that us'd to be among
the <hi>Tombs.</hi> The <hi>subtle, false</hi> and <hi>faithless</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:62368:23"/>
men that walk in mazes, never shall meet
God; these are the <hi>windings</hi> and the <hi>tracts</hi>
of the old <hi>Serpent,</hi> and they lead onely to
his habitation. They that do <hi>climb</hi> as if
they meant to find God on his own
Throne, that follow Christ up <hi>to a pinnacle</hi>
of <hi>the Temple,</hi> or to the <hi>top</hi> of that exceeding
high <hi>Mount,</hi> whence they can overlook the
glories of the World, and pick and chuse,
these do not goe to seek Christ there: It
is the <hi>Devil</hi> that does carry up thither,<note place="margin">Mat. 4.</note> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his own designs. Nor is it possible to
seek the <hi>Lord</hi> in the waies that lead to the
<hi>strange Womans house,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 7. 27.</note> for <hi>her house is the way
to hell, Solomon</hi> saies, (and he did know;)
nay more, <hi>her steps take hold on hell,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 5. 5.</note> seise on
those everlasting burnings which her foul
heats <hi>kindle</hi> and <hi>begin.</hi> In a word, they
that <hi>seek their own,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 21.</note> that turn all merely to
their advantage, they cannot seek God too,
he will not be <hi>joynt God</hi> with <hi>Mammon.</hi>
And then where are the men that sought
him? that did retrive him to us? or
with whom does he dwell? If he be not
among us, we do in vain flatter our selves
in our prosperity and peace, gawd it in all
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:62368:24"/>
our bright appearances. Have we not
seen the Sun rise with the glory of a day
about him, and mounting in his strength
chase away all the little receptacles and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses
of the night, not leave a cloud to
shelter the least relicks of her darkness, or
any spot to checquer or to fleck the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of day? when strait a small
handful of vapour rais'd by that Sun it
self did creep upon his face, and by little
and little getting strength bedasht his
shine, and pour'd out as full streams of
storm as he had done of light; till it
even put out the day, and shed a night
upon the Earth in spight of him. So may
prosperity it self, if the Lord and his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
be not in it, raise that which will
soon overcast and benight the most glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
condition of a Nation. That <hi>wine</hi>
which now makes your hearts glad, may
prove like that which did commit the
<hi>Centaures</hi> and the <hi>Lapithae,</hi> first kindle <hi>Lusts,</hi>
then <hi>Warres,</hi> and at last onely fill a <hi>Cup of
trembling</hi> and <hi>astonishment;</hi> and that <hi>oyle</hi>
that does make you <hi>chearful countenances,</hi>
may make your <hi>paths slippery,</hi> and nourish
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62368:24"/>
               <hi>flames</hi> that will devour and ruine all.</p>
            <p>But God,<note place="margin">Isay 65. 1.</note> 
               <hi>who is found of them that seek
him not,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4, 5.</note> nay who himself <hi>sought</hi> the <hi>lost sheep</hi>
and <hi>carried</hi> him, when with his straying he
was wearied into impossibility of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
has also <hi>sought,</hi> and <hi>found,</hi> and <hi>brought
together us</hi> and our <hi>great Shepherd:</hi> for <hi>this
is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our
eyes;</hi> these <hi>waies</hi> of his also are so <hi>past find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out,</hi> that we may well conclude they
are the mere footsteps of his incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible
goodness, and we have onely
now <hi>to fear that goodness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But give me leave to say, those that <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise</hi>
his goodness do not <hi>fear</hi> it; and they
whom it does <hi>not lead to repentance,</hi> do <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise</hi>
it, S. <hi>Paul</hi> saies, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 4. <hi>Despisest thou
the riches of his goodness and forbearance and
long-sufferance, not knowing that the goodness of
the Lord leads thee to repentance?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, ô Lord, what sort of men
among us hath thy goodness <hi>wrought</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and made <hi>repent?</hi> Those whom it was
directed to convince, and came on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to, to prove by their own onely argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
they had of <hi>providential Miracles,</hi> they
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62368:25"/>
were not in the right, but that <hi>destruction
and misery were in their waies;</hi> yet these
chuse rather to <hi>deny their own conclusions,</hi>
and <hi>resist God's goodness,</hi> then to be <hi>convinc'd</hi>
and <hi>repent:</hi> for we have seen them as bold
<hi>Martyrs</hi> to their <hi>Sin</hi> as ever any to <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi>
signalize their resolv'd impenitence
with chearful suffering, as if the <hi>fire</hi> they
were condemn'd to were that <hi>triumphal Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot</hi>
in which the Prophet mounted up to
heaven.<note place="margin">2 King. 2. 11.</note> Others that did not go so farre
in condemnation nor guilt as they, and
therefore think they have no reason to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
of that, do they repent of what they
did <hi>contribute</hi> to it? Of those that lifted
up their hands to <hi>swear</hi> and <hi>fight,</hi> how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
are there that have made them fall, and
<hi>smite their own thigh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 31. 19.</note> 
               <hi>saying, What have I done?</hi>
Do not all rather justifie as farre as they
themselves proceeded? and if all that were
well, why do not we repent of our Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance
and Loyalty? if all that were well,
what hath thy goodness done, ô Lord,
that hath reverst it all? And for the rest,
those that do not partake the plenties of
thy goodness, murmure and repine at it;
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62368:25"/>
are discontent at having what they <hi>pray'd
for,</hi> what they <hi>would have dy'd for:</hi> those
that have been partakers of it, have <hi>turn'd
it into wantonness,</hi> have made it furnish
them for base unworthy practices. Such
as have not the generosity of vice, have
not a noble, manly wickedness, are <hi>poltron
sins;</hi> have made it raise a cry on the <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullest
party,</hi> the <hi>best Cause,</hi> and the <hi>purest
Church</hi> in the World. While we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd
God's own best Attribute, made
his Goodness procure for our most wicked
or self-ends: and the face of things is so
vicious in every <hi>order</hi> and <hi>degree</hi> and <hi>sexe,</hi>
that—But the <hi>Confession</hi> is onely fit for
<hi>Litanies,</hi> and we have need to make the

again,</hi> send out thy <hi>Indignation,</hi> for we
do fear thy <hi>goodness,</hi> it hath almost undone
us: and truly, where it does not better, 'tis
the most fearful of God's <hi>Attributes</hi> or
<hi>plagues,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 5.</note> for it does <hi>harden</hi> there. S. <hi>Paul</hi>
saies so in the fore-cited place; and <hi>Origen</hi>
does prove this very thing did <hi>harden Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>'s
heart, <hi>indulgence</hi> was his <hi>induration.</hi>
Now <hi>induration</hi> is the being put in <hi>Hell
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:62368:26"/>
upon the Earth:</hi> there is the same <hi>impenitence</hi>
in both, and <hi>Iudgement</hi> is pronounc'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
on the hardned, and the life they
lead is but the <hi>interval</hi> betwixt the <hi>Sentence</hi>
and the <hi>Execution,</hi> and all their Sun-shine
of Prosperity is but <hi>kindled brimstone,</hi> onely
without the <hi>stench.</hi> And then to make the
treasures of God's bounty be <hi>treasures of
wrath</hi> to us, to make his <hi>kindness,</hi> his <hi>long-suffering,</hi>
that is,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 15.</note> S. <hi>Peter</hi> sayes, <hi>salvation,
condemne</hi> us, his very <hi>goodness</hi> be <hi>hell</hi> to us!
But sure so great a goodness as this we
have tasted cannot have such deadly is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues;
and it was great indeed, so perfectly
miraculous in such strange and continued
successes, resisting our <hi>contrivances</hi> and our
<hi>sins</hi> too, overcoming all opposition of our
<hi>vices</hi> and our own <hi>policies,</hi> that do not <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi>
with it, and in despight of all still do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us good; it was <hi>fatality of goodness.</hi>
Now sure that which is so victorious will
not be worsted by us. But <hi>oh!</hi> have we
not reason so much more to fear the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?
The greater and more undeserv'd
it is, the more <hi>suspicious</hi> it is: as if it were
the <hi>last blaze</hi> of the candle of the Lord
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:62368:26"/>
when its <hi>light gasps,</hi> its <hi>flash</hi> of shine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it do <hi>goe out,</hi> the <hi>dying struggles</hi> and
<hi>extreme efforts</hi> of goodness, to see if at the
last any thing can be wrought by it. And
if we did consider how some men menage
the present goodness, make use of this
time of it, and rake, and catch, we would
believe they did fear the departure of it:
but yet 'tis in our power to fixe it here.
If we repent, <hi>God's gifts</hi> then <hi>are without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi>
but one of us must change: bring
Piety and Vertue into countenance and
fashion, and God will dwell among us.
