            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

no way ſo to do, but to lay up a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of comfort in an <hi>holy Converſation.</hi> A wicked man would gladly <hi>forget himſelf,</hi> and run away from himſelf, <hi>Hoc ſe quiſque modo ſemper fugit.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lucretius.</note> He cannot look <hi>backward</hi> or <hi>inward</hi> upon himſelf, without guilt and horror.

            <p>2. It is an <hi>Heroical grace,</hi> as the <hi>Philoſopher</hi> ſaith of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> That it is <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>4. It is a <hi>Patient Grace;</hi> it is not diſcouraged with every <hi>obstacle,</hi> nor diſmayed with every <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riculament,</hi> nor wearied with every <hi>encounter;</hi> but like <hi>Box,</hi> or <hi>Holly,</hi> and ſuch other <hi>Trees,</hi> retains its verdure in the <hi>Winter,</hi> and holds out amidſt all difficulties unto the <hi>End,</hi> knows how near the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed mercies</hi> are, and doth chearfully preſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward towards them; ſays with thoſe in the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, Iſai. 25. 9.

            <p>5. It is a <hi>Praying Grace,</hi> can in every exigent and diſtreſs call down inviſible help from <hi>God:</hi> And none go with more vigor about any enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe then they, who being <hi>backed</hi> with <hi>potent friends,</hi> and having <hi>free-acceſs</hi> unto <hi>great Treaſures,</hi> are able in any extremity to obtain the <hi>concurrent counſels</hi> and <hi>ſuccors</hi> of others, to further their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns.

The <hi>Apostle</hi> bids us by <hi>Faith</hi> to ask <hi>wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> that thereby <hi>patience</hi> may go thorow and have her <hi>perfect work, Jam. 1. 4, 5, 6. God</hi> hath honored <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> in the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> above other <hi>graces,</hi> becauſe they have a peculiar <hi>vertue</hi> to carry us out of our ſelves in Prayer unto <hi>God:</hi> And no <hi>graces</hi> do more promote great <hi>acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> then <hi>ſelf-denying graces,</hi> when men have <hi>ends</hi> and <hi>aids</hi> above themſelves. <hi>Carnal ends, domeſtical intereſts,</hi> and <hi>private affections,</hi> do uſually obſtruct <hi>noble undertakings;</hi> becauſe ſuch men, as ſoon as <hi>ſtorms</hi> ariſe, and <hi>difficulties</hi> ſhake them, forſake the <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>internal merits</hi> of the <hi>buſineſs,</hi> and hold or alter their <hi>reſolutions,</hi> according as their own <hi>perſonal hopes</hi> or <hi>fears</hi> do dictate unto them. And therefore the beſt way to make ſtrong and ſteady progreſs in any ſerious employment, is to have <hi>God for our God,</hi> that in every difficulty we may be able to have recourſe unto him for <hi>counſel, wiſdom, ſuccor, ſupport,</hi> and may be <hi>ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. As <hi>Faith</hi> is a ſpecial principle of <hi>action</hi> in <hi>great undertakings;</hi> ſo it is a ſpecial ground of <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi> in the reviewing of them, when we can ſay, In this <hi>action,</hi> though full of many difficulties, yet <hi>Faith in God as my God,</hi> hath upheld me and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me through it to the end: I have undertaken it not in mine own ſtrength, nor in the confidence of mine own wiſdom; but in an <hi>holy fear,</hi> and <hi>comfortable dependance</hi> upon <hi>God;</hi> I have aimed at his <hi>glory,</hi> and at <hi>publick intereſt;</hi> I have not immix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nor interwoven in it, any <hi>carnal counſels,</hi> or
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:119004:16"/>
               <hi>ſinful projects</hi> of mine own: I have labored to keep a good <hi>conſcience</hi> in doing of mine own <hi>duty,</hi> and have caſt my ſelf upon his <hi>holy providence</hi> for the <hi>event:</hi> In this caſe the <hi>Lord</hi> doth ordinarily return ſuch an anſwer of <hi>peace</hi> to <hi>works</hi> that are done in the fear of his <hi>name,</hi> by the <hi>rule</hi> of his <hi>Word,</hi> in the <hi>comfort</hi> of his <hi>promiſes,</hi> and with ſubmiſſion to his <hi>providence,</hi> as that one way or other, the heart ſhall be able to take comfort in it: For <hi>Faith</hi> is a <hi>ſucceſsful grace,</hi> and hath a promiſe of <hi>proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Believe in the Lord your God, ſo ſhall you be eſtabliſhed; beleeve his Prophets, ſo ſhall you proſper, 2 Chron.</hi> 20. 20. By <hi>Faith, Iſrael</hi> paſſed through the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> and ſaw the victory of their <hi>Faith</hi> in the ruine of their proud enemies, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 30, 31.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Lord</hi> bleſs the undertaking it ſelf, with a deſired <hi>ſucceſs, Faith</hi> hath this comfort, That it is a <hi>bleſsing</hi> received from the hand of a <hi>Father,</hi> an evidence of his <hi>love,</hi> an acceſſion unto the gift of his <hi>Son<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with whom he freely giveth all other things.</hi> It is the portion which <hi>God</hi> hath gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly given unto his ſervant; and though the thing given be good it ſelf, yet the <hi>favor</hi> and <hi>bleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of <hi>God</hi> which comes along with it, is much more excellent; as the Money in the Mouth of the Fiſh, or the Pearl in the Body of the Oyſter is more precious then that which was the <hi>vehicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>And on the other hand, if the <hi>Lord</hi> ſuffer not our <hi>labors</hi> to ſucceed, yet he is <hi>our God</hi> himſelf ſtill, and all <hi>deſireable good</hi> is eminently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed

in him, who is a <hi>God All-ſufficient to thoſe that walk before him, and are upright.</hi> Though he anſwer me not in the particular, wherein I waited upon him, he ever anſwers <hi>Secundum cardinem de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderii,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Aug. Confeſ. lib. 5. c. 8.</note> in ſuch a way as is better for me: Though the iſſue be not <hi>ſecundum voluntatem,</hi> according to<note place="margin">

Eccleſ. c. 19. &amp; contr. Julian. lib. 5. cap. 4. &amp; ep. 121. cap. 14.</note> my will, yet it is ever <hi>ad utilitatem,</hi> according to my profit and good. <hi>Paul</hi> had not the thing he expreſly prayed for, to have the meſſenger of Satan depart from him, but he had a <hi>ſufficiency of grace</hi> to uphold him, which was much better. And as a <hi>Merchant</hi> is not angry with his <hi>Factor,</hi> though he ſend him not the <hi>commodities</hi> he wrote for, if he ſend him thoſe which are ten times more bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial; no more is a <hi>believer</hi> diſpleaſed with the good providence of <hi>God,</hi> when he receives in anſwer to his <hi>labors</hi> and <hi>prayers,</hi> not what himſelf expected, but what <hi>God</hi> knew much better for him.</p>
            <p>III. A ſpecial intereſt <hi>in God as our God,</hi> is a notable argument in <hi>Prayer,</hi> for the obtaining of a <hi>gracious Reward</hi> unto our ſincere <hi>Services;</hi> for upon this ground doth this <hi>holy man</hi> thrice deſire to <hi>be remembred of God:</hi> And upon this ground did our <hi>Saviour</hi> teach his Diſciples to build all their <hi>Petitions</hi> by calling God <hi>Our Father.</hi> It is the <hi>Prayer of Faith,</hi> the <hi>Prayer</hi> of a <hi>righteous man</hi> that is effectual, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 15, 16. For the <hi>Lord</hi> will not hear thoſe that <hi>regard iniquity in their heart,</hi> their Prayer is an <hi>abomination, Pſal.</hi> 66. 18. The <hi>Lord</hi> is far from the wicked, but he <hi>heareth the prayer of the righteous, Prov.</hi> 15. 29.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:119004:17"/>It is true, he is pleaſed ſometimes to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the <hi>Cries</hi> and <hi>Prayers</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn ſome anſwer unto them, that even wicked men may know that it is not in vain even for them to <hi>ſeek the Lord;</hi> and therefore ſuch as their <hi>Prayers</hi> are, ſuch <hi>returns</hi> he is pleaſed many times to make unto them. So <hi>God</hi> heard the voice of <hi>Iſhmael</hi> crying for Water, and ſhewed <hi>Hagar</hi> a Well, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21. 17, 19. He took notice of the <hi>humiliation</hi> of <hi>Ahab,</hi> and thereupon reſpited the <hi>judgment</hi> which he had threatned, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21. 29. As <hi>Abraham,</hi> though he gave the <hi>bleſsing</hi> and the <hi>inheritance</hi> unto <hi>Iſaac,</hi> yet he gave gifts to the reſt of his children, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25. 5, 6. So the <hi>Lord,</hi> though he reſerve his <hi>great Reward</hi> for the <hi>heirs of promiſe,</hi> yet he leaveth not himſelf without <hi>wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> even amongſt others, giving ſuch <hi>benefits</hi> unto them as they tender <hi>ſervices</hi> unto him; they give none but <hi>outward ſervices,</hi> deſire none but <hi>outward benefits;</hi> and according to the <hi>nature</hi> of their <hi>ſervices</hi> and <hi>deſires,</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> anſwereth them with meer <hi>outward good things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>Prayer of Faith,</hi> pleading the great and precious <hi>promiſes</hi> of the <hi>new Covenant,</hi> and calling upon <hi>God</hi> as a <hi>Father</hi> by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of his <hi>Son</hi> ſhed abroad into the hearts of thoſe who are <hi>heirs of promiſe,</hi> hath two great advantages above any other meer <hi>Natural prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. It is ſure to obtain <hi>pardon</hi> for what failings and miſcarriages proceed from <hi>humane infirmity,</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> ſparing his children, <hi>as a man ſpareth his own ſon that ſerveth him, Mal.</hi> 3. 17. and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:119004:17"/>
               <hi>Chriſt</hi> bearing the iniquity of our <hi>holy things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. It is ſure to obtain <hi>ſpiritual rewards</hi> for thoſe holy and ſincere <hi>performances,</hi> which proceed from the grace and aſſiſtance of the <hi>Spirit of Chriſt;</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> being pleaſed, firſt, by his <hi>grace</hi> to <hi>work</hi> all our works for us, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 26. 12. And then by a ſecond <hi>grace</hi> to <hi>reward</hi> them, and to <hi>crown</hi> his own <hi>mercies</hi> in us. <hi>For verily there is a reward for the righteous, Pſal. 58. 11. Matth.</hi> 10. 41. And thus we receive <hi>grace for grace;</hi> the <hi>grace</hi> of <hi>remuneration</hi> for the <hi>grace</hi> of <hi>obedience;</hi> the <hi>grace</hi> of <hi>God</hi> enabling us to work, and the <hi>grace</hi> of <hi>God</hi> rewarding us for working: For though it be the <hi>work</hi> which is rewarded, yet the <hi>reward</hi> is not of mans work, but of <hi>Gods</hi> grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 4. &amp; 11. 6. Both theſe graces did this holy <hi>Nehemiah</hi> beg, in the confidence of his intereſt <hi>in God as his God. Remember me, O my God, concerning this alſo, and ſpare me, according to the greatneſs of thy meroy, Nehe.</hi> 13. 22. Remember me to <hi>ſpare me</hi> for my ſinful infirmities; remember me to <hi>reward me</hi> for my ſincere performances; and both theſe onely upon the accompt of thy <hi>great mercy.</hi> Nothing but <hi>great mercy</hi> paſſeth by many ſins; nothing but <hi>great mercy</hi> rewardeth weak ſervices.</p>
            <p>I have done with the words, and have from all but a word more to ſay unto you. What the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of that <hi>great undertaking</hi> is, which <hi>God</hi> hath thus graciouſly moved your hearts to begin at the doors of his <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> and to conſecrate your ſelves unto, by <hi>inquiring</hi> of him, and <hi>ſeeking of him a right way,</hi> is much better known to you
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:119004:18"/>
then to me, who have little <hi>inſpection</hi> into ſuch things: But being a very weighty buſineſs, and poſſibly full of <hi>variety</hi> and <hi>difficulty,</hi> and all men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubject to <hi>errors</hi> and <hi>mistakes,</hi> to <hi>impotency</hi> and <hi>infirmity,</hi> to <hi>ſinful failings</hi> and <hi>defects,</hi> to <hi>difference</hi> of <hi>judgments,</hi> and <hi>divided affections,</hi> and all <hi>humane actions</hi> being obnoxious to <hi>miſconſtructions</hi> and <hi>various miſcarriages:</hi> And <hi>God</hi> having reſerved <hi>events</hi> and <hi>ſucceſſes</hi> in his proper power, it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your duty in all your <hi>addreſſes</hi> unto <hi>action,</hi> to make your <hi>firſt applications unto God,</hi> that he would <hi>lead you by his Spirit,</hi> and cauſe you to make <hi>his Word your Counſellors;</hi> that he would <hi>work all your works for you,</hi> and ſhine upon <hi>your counſels and undertakings</hi> by his <hi>ſpecial bleſsing;</hi> that he would preſerve you from <hi>all miſtakes</hi> and <hi>miſunderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> and pour out upon you a <hi>ſpirit of unity and agreement;</hi> that he would forgive all your <hi>failings,</hi> and teach you to approve your <hi>hearts</hi> and <hi>conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> unto him in well-doing; that your <hi>labors</hi> may ſo be converſant about <hi>treaſures</hi> here below, as that your <hi>hearts</hi> and <hi>affections</hi> may be upon things <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove;</hi> and you may with ſuch <hi>ſincerity, courage, zeal,</hi> and <hi>holy affections,</hi> go through the <hi>duties</hi> of your <hi>places</hi> and <hi>callings</hi> here, as that you may be able to look <hi>backward</hi> with comfort upon a <hi>fruitful life,</hi> and <hi>forward</hi> with <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> upon a <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Reward,</hi> and conclude your <hi>lives</hi> and your <hi>labors,</hi> as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> doth his Book, with a <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber me, O my God, for Good.</hi> And we ſhould all learn ſo to lead our lives, with ſuch an eye to <hi>Gods Word</hi> and <hi>Rule,</hi> to his <hi>glory</hi> and <hi>honor,</hi> to the
