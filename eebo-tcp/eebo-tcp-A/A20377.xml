            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T hath bin
lately main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in an
<hi>Academicall</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute,
That the best
travailing is in
<pb facs="tcp:10163:3"/>
maps and good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours:
because
thereby a man may
take a view of the
state and manners
of the whole world,
and neuer mix with
the corruptions of
it. A pleasing opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for solitary pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners,
who may
<pb facs="tcp:10163:3"/>
thus travell ouer
the world, though
confined to a dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon.
And, indeed,
it is a good way to
keepe a man inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent;
but withall as
Ignorant. Our se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentary
Traueller
may passe for a wise
man, as long as hee
<pb facs="tcp:10163:4"/>
converseth either
with dead men by
reading; or by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
with men ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.
But let him
once enter on the
stage of publike im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
and hee
will soone find, if he
can bee but sensible
of contempt, that he
<pb facs="tcp:10163:4"/>
is vnfit for Action.
For ability to treat
with men of seueral
humours, factions,
and Countries; duly
to comply with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>,
or stand off, as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
shall require,
is not gotten onely
byreading of books,
but rather by stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying
<pb facs="tcp:10163:5"/>
of men. Yet
this euer holdstrue;
The best scholler is
fittest for a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueller,
as being able
to make the most
vseful obseruation:
Experience added
to learning, makes
a perfect Man.</p>
            <p>It must, therfore,
<pb facs="tcp:10163:5"/>
be confessed, That
to fit men for Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation,
the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of forraine
Countries is most
necessary: This
kingdom iustly glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
in many noble
Instruments, whose
Abilities haue been
perfitted by that
<pb facs="tcp:10163:6"/>
meanes. But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
it cannot bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied,
that many men
while they ayme at
this fitnesse make
themselus vnfit for
any thing<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Some goe
ouer full of good
qualitie, and better
hopes; who, hauing
as it were emptied
<pb facs="tcp:10163:6"/>
themselues in other
places, return laden
with nothing but
the vices, if not the
diseases of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
which they
haue seene. And,
which is most to bee
pittied, they are
commonly the best
wits, and purest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacles
<pb facs="tcp:10163:7"/>
of sound
knowledge, that are
thus corrupted.
Whether it be, that
they are more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly
assaulted with
vice then others; or
whether they doe
more easily admit
any obuiousimpres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:
howeuer it be;
<pb facs="tcp:10163:7"/>
fit it is, That all
young Trauellers
should receine an
Antidot against the
infectious Ayre of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Countries.</p>
            <p>For this purpose,
diuers learned men
haue prescribed
rules and precepts:
which haue done
<pb facs="tcp:10163:8"/>
much good, howeuer
in many things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectiue.
For as hee
that read a Lecture
to <hi>Hannibal</hi> of the
Art of war, shewed
that himself was no
souldier, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
vnfit to teach a
great Commander:
so He, that neuer
<pb facs="tcp:10163:8"/>
trauelled but in his
Books, can hardly
shew his learning,
without manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his want of
experience.</p>
            <p>It hath therefore
been much desired,
that some men who
had themselues bin
Trauellers, &amp; had
<pb facs="tcp:10163:9"/>
made lest vse of
their trauels, would
giue some vnfailing
directions to others.
Such are here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented

                  <opener>
                     <salute>My Lord,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I Hold it for a
principle in the
course of Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of State, not to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:10163:24"/>
discourage men of
meane capacity from
writing vnto mee;
though I had at that
same time very able
aduertisements: for
either they sent mee
matter which the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
omitted, or made
it clearer by descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
the circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
or, if added no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
yet they confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
that which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:10163:24"/>
single I might
haue doubted. This
rule I haue, therefore,
prescribed to others,
and now giue it to
my selfe. Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
hath many frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ds
who haue more lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to thinke, and
more sufficiencie to
counsel than my selfe;
yet doth my loue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
these few lines to
the study of you. If
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:10163:25"/>
you find out nothing
but that which you
haue from others; yet,
perhaps, by the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of others, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
the opinion of
wiser than my selfe
Your Lordships pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
is to trauell; and
your study must bee
what vse to make
thereof. The questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is ordinary, and
there is to it an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:10163:25"/>
answer; that is,
your Lordship shall
see the beauty of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Cities, know the
manners of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
and learne the
language of many
Nations. Some of
these may serue for
ornaments, al of them
for delight: But your
Lordship must looke
further than these
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:10163:26"/>
things; for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
ornament is the
beauty of the minde,
and when you haue
as great delight as the
world can afford you,
you will confesse that
the greatest delight is
<hi>Sentire teindies fieri me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liorum.</hi>
Therfore your
Lordships end and
scope should be, that
which is morall Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,
we call <hi>Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:10163:26"/>
Animi,</hi> the gifts
and excellencies of
the mind. And they
are the same as those
are of the body, Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Health, &amp; strength.
The beauty of the
minde is shewed in
gratefull and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
forms and sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of behauiour;
and they that haue
that gift, cause those
to whom they deny
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:10163:27"/>
any thing, to goe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
contented away,
than men of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
disposition doe
those to whom they
grant. Health of mind
consisteth in an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moueable
constancy
and freedome from
passions, which are
indeed the sicknesse
of the mind; strength
of mind is that actiue
power which maketh
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:10163:27"/>
vs perform good and
great things, as well
as health, and euen
temper of mind kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
vs from euil and
base things. First,
these three are to bee
sought for, although
the greatest part of
men haue none of
them. Some haue one
and lacke the other
two; some few at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
to haue two of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:10163:28"/>
them, and lacke the
third; and almost
none of them haue
all.</p>
                  <p>The first way to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
to experience of
formes or behauiour,
is to make the minde
it selfe expert; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour
is but a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and it is easie to
make a comely gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for a body that
is well proportioned;
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:10163:28"/>
whereas a deformed
body can neuer bee
helped by Taylors
art, but the Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetting
will appeare.
And in the forme of
the minde it is a true
rule, that a man may
mend his faults with
as little labor as couer
them.</p>
                  <p>The second way
is by imitation; and
to that end, good
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:10163:29"/>
choyce is to be made
with whom we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse.
Therefore your
Lordship should af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
their companie
whom you finde to
be worthiest, and not
partially thinke them
most worthy whom
you affect.</p>
                  <p>To attaine to the
health of the minde,
we must vse the same
meanes which wee
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:10163:29"/>
doe for the health of
our bodies; that is, to
make obserua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ce what
diseases we are aptest
to fal into, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide
against them: for
Physicke hath not
more remedy against
the difease of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
than Reason hath
preseruatiues against
the Passions of the
mind.</p>
                  <p>To set downe
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:10163:30"/>
meanes how a man
may attaine to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue
power mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in this place, (I
meane strength of
mind,) is much har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
then to giue rules
in the other two: For
behauiour and good
forme may be gotten
by education; and
health, and euen tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of the minde, by
good obseruation;
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:10163:30"/>
but if there bee not in
nature some partner
in this actiue stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>gth,
it can neuer be attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by any industry;
for the vertues that are
proper vnto it, are Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality,
Magnanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Fortitude &amp; Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence:
And some
are by nature so coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous,
and cowardly, as
it is as much in vaine
to inflame or inlarge
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:10163:31"/>
their minds, as to goe
about to plough the
Rockes. But where
these actiue vertues
are but budding, they
must bee repaired by
ripenesse of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and custome
of wel-doing. Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of iudgement
makes men liberall,
for it teacheth them
to esteeme of the
goods of Fortune,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:10163:31"/>
not for themselues
(for so they are but
Iaylors to them) but
for their vse, for so
they are Lords ouer
them. And it maketh
vs know, that it is
<hi>Beatius dare, quam ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipere;</hi>
the one being
abadge of Soueraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the other of subie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
Also it leadeth
vs to Fortitude; for it
teacheth, that wee
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:10163:32"/>
should not too much
prize life, which we
cannot keepe; nor
feare death, which
wee cannot shunne;
That as he which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Nobly, doth liue
for euer; so hee that
doth liue in feare,
doth die continually.
I shall not need to
proue these two
things; for we see by
experience, they hold
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:10163:32"/>
true in all things
which I haue hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
set downe. What
I desire or wish, I
would haue your
Lordship to take in
minde, what it is to
make your selfe an
expert man, and what
are the generall helps
which all men must
vse which haue the
same desire. I will
now moue your
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:10163:33"/>
Lordship to consider
what helps your tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
will gaine you.</p>
                  <p>First, when you see
infinite variety of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauior
and manners
of men, you must
choose and imitate
the best; when you
see new delights that
you neuer knew, and
haue passions stirred
in you which you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
felt, you shall
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:10163:33"/>
know what disease
your minde is aptest
to fall into, and what
the things are that
bred that disease:
When you come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Armies, or places
where you shall see
any thing of the wars,
you shall conforme
your natural courage
to be fit for true For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude;
which is not
giuen vnto man by
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:10163:34"/>
nature, but must grow
out of the discourse
of reason: And last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in your trauell you
shall haue great help
to attaine to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
which is not
onely the excellentest
thing in man, but the
very excellency of
man.</p>
                  <p>In Manners, your
Lordship must not
be caught with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelties,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:10163:34"/>
which are
pleasing to young
men; nor infected
with Custome, which
maketh vs keepe our
owne all graces, and
participate of those
wee see euery day;
nor giuen to affectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which is a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
fault amongst
English Trauellers;
which is both dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing
&amp; ridiculous.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:10163:35"/>
In discouering your
passions, and meeting
with them, giue no
way, or dispense
with your selfe, resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
to conquer
your selfe in all; for
the streame that may
be stop'd with a mans
hand at the Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
may drowne
whole Armies when
it hath run long.</p>
                  <p>In your being in
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:10163:35"/>
warres, thinke it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
at the first to doe a
great deale too much
than any thing too
little; for a young
man, especially a
strangers first actions
are looked vpon, and
Reputation once
gotten, is easily kept;
but an euill impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
conceiued at the
first, is not easily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:10163:36"/>
The last thing I am
to speake, is but the
first you are to seeke;
It is Knowledge. To
praise knowledge, or
to perswade your
Lordship to seeke it,
I shall not need to vse
many words; I will
onely say, Where it is
wanting, that man is
voyd of any good.</p>
                  <p>Without it there
can be no Fortitude,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:10163:36"/>
for all dangers come
of fury, and fury is
passion, and passions
euer turne to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries;
and therfore
the most furious
men, when their first
blast is spent, be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
the most fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
                  <p>Without it, there
can be no Liberalitie;
for giuing is but want
of audacitie to deny,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:10163:37"/>
or else discretion to
poyse.</p>
                  <p>Without it, there
can be no Iustice; for
giuing to a man that
which is his owne, is
but chance, or want
of a corrupter or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducer.</p>
                  <p>Without it there
can be no Constancy
or Patience; for suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
is but dulnesse
or senselesnesse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:10163:37"/>
Without it there
can be no tempera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ce;
for we shall restraine
our selues from good
as well as from euill.
For hee that cannot
discerne, cannot elect
or choose. Nay, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it, there can bee
no true Religion; all
other devotion being
but a blinde zeale,
which is as strong in
Heresie as in Truth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:10163:38"/>
To reckon vp all
the parts of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and to shew
the way to attaine to
euery part, is a worke
too great for mee to
vndertake at any
time, and too long to
discourse at this time;
therefore I will onely
speake of such a
knowledge as your
Lordship shold haue
desire to seeke, and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:10163:38"/>
shall haue meanes to
compasse: I forbeare
also to speake of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
knowledge,
which must direct
our Faith; both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I find my owne
insufficiency, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I hope your
Lordship doth nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
the seeds of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
which during
your education at
<hi>Cambridge</hi> were sown
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:10163:39"/>
in you: I will onely
say this; That as the
irresolute man can
neuer performe any
action well; so hee
that is not resolued in
Religion, can bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued
in nothing
else. But that Ciuill
knowledge which
will make you doe
wel by your selfe, and
good vnto others,
must bee sought by
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:10163:39"/>
Study, by Conference,
and obseruation.</p>
                  <p>In the course of
your Study, &amp; choice
of your booke, you
must looke to haue
the grounds of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
which are the
Liberal Arts; and then
vse study of delight
but sometimes for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation,
and neither
drowne your selfe in
them, nor omit those
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:10163:40"/>
studies whereof you
are to haue continual
vse. Aboue all other
bookes, bee conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
in Histories, for
they will best instruct
you in matters Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
Politike, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary,
by which, and
in which you must
settle your Iudgment.</p>
                  <p>I make Conference
the second helpe to
Knowledge in order,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:10163:40"/>
though I finde it the
first and greatest in
profiting; and I haue
so placed them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
hee that is not
studied, knoweth not
what to doubt, nor
what to aske. To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
much by Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
you must chuse
to conferre with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert
men; for men
will be of contrary o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions,
and euery
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:10163:41"/>
one will make his
owne probable. In
Conference bee nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
suspitious, nor
beleeuing all you
know, what opinion
soeuer you haue of
the man that deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
it, nor too desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to contradict. I
doe conclude this
point of Conference
with this aduice, That
your Lordship should
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:10163:41"/>
rather go an hundred
miles to speake with
one wise man, than
fiue miles to see a fair
Towne.</p>
                  <p>The third way to
attaine to Knowledge
is Obseruation, and
not long life, nor see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
much; because
as he that rides a way
often, and takes no
care of notes or marks
to direct him if hee
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:10163:42"/>
come the same way
againe to make him
know where hee is
if he come vnto it, he
shall neuer proue
good guide; So hee
that liueth long, and
seeth much, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth
nothing, shall
neuer proue any wise
man.</p>
                  <p>The vse of Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
is in noting
the coherence of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:10163:42"/>
effects, counsels,
and succcesses, with
the proportion and
likenesse betweene
Nature and Nature,
Fortune and Fortune,
Action and Action,
State and State, Time
past and Time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.
Your Lordship
now seeth, that the
end of Study, Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
and Obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is Knowledge;
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:10163:43"/>
you must know also
that the true end of
knowledge is cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and strength of
Iudgement, and not
ostentation, or abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to discourse; which
I doe the rather put
your Lordship in
mind of, because the
most part of Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and Gentlemen
of our time haue no
other vse nor end of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:10163:43"/>
their learning but
their Table-talke. But
God knoweth they
haue gotten little that
haue onely this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing
gift; for
though like empty
vessels they sound
loud when a man
knockes vpon their
out sides; yet if you
peere into them, you
shall finde that they
are full of nothing
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:10163:44"/>
but winde.</p>
                  <p>This rule holdeth
not onely in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
or in the vertue
of knowledge, or in
the vertue of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
but in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vertues.</p>
                  <p>I will here breake
off, for I finde that I
have both exceeded
the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>uenient length
of a Letter, and come
short of such dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:10163:44"/>
as this subiect
doth deserue.</p>
                  <p>Your Lordship,
perhaps, may finde
many things in this
paper superfluous;
and most of them,
lame. I will, as well
as I can, supply that
defect vpon the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
aduertisement,
if you call mee to an
account. What con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
soeuer you
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:10163:45"/>
finde in my order or
method, is not onely
my fault (whose wits
are confounded with
too much businesse)
but the fault of this
season, being written
in Christmas, which
confusion and disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
hath by tradition
not only beene win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
at, but warranted.
If there bee but any
one thing which
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:10163:45"/>
your Lordship may
make vse of, I thinke
my pains wel bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in all. And how
weake soeuer my
counsels bee, my wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes
shall be as strong
as any mans for your

                  <head>A Letter to the
same purpose.</head>
                  <p>MY good Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
you haue
thought vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindnesse
in me, that
I haue not written
oftner vnto you, and
haue desired I should
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:10163:47"/>
write vnto you some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of my opinion
touching your tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell;
you being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
my experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
therin to be som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
which I must
needs confesse; but
not as you take it. For
you thinke my expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
growes from
the good things
which I haue learned:
but I know the only
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:10163:48"/>
experience which I
haue gotten, is, to find
how much I might
haue learned, &amp; how
much indeed I haue
missed, for want of
directing my course
to the right end, and
by the right meanes. I
thinke you haue read
<hi>Aristotles</hi> Ethiques;
If you haue, you know
it is the beginning &amp;
foundation of all his
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:10163:48"/>
worke, the end to
which euery man
doth and ought to
bend his greatest and
smallest Actions, I
am sure you haue im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed
in your mind
the scope and marke
you meane, by your
paines, to shoot at.
For if you should tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
but to trauell, or
to say you had trauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
certainely you
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:10163:49"/>
should proue a pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim,
no more. But I
presume so well of
you (that though a
great number of vs
never thought in our
selves why we went,
but a certain tickling
humour to doe as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men had done,)
you prupose, being a
Gentleman borne, to
furnish your selfe
with the knowledge
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:10163:49"/>
of such things as may
bee serviceable for
your Country &amp; cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.
Which certainly
stands not in the
change of Ayre, (for
the warmest Sunne
makes not a wise ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>)
no, nor in learning
Languages (although
they be of serviceable
vse) for words are but
words in what Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
soever they be;
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:10163:50"/>
and much lesse in that
all of vs come home
full of disguisements
not onely of apparel,
but of our counte
nances, as though the
credit of a Traueller
stood all vpon his
outside: but in the
right informing your
minde with those
things which are most
notable in those pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
which you come
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:10163:50"/>
vnto. Of which as the
one kinde is so vaine,
as I thinke, ere it bee
long, like the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebanks
in Italy, wee
Travellers shall bee
made sport of in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies;
so may I inst<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
say, who rightly
trauels with the eye
of <hi>Vlysses,</hi> doth take
one of the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
ways of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wisdome. For hard
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:10163:51"/>
sure it is to know Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
without you
know it by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
it with some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Countrey; no
more than a man can
know the swiftnesse
of his horse without
seeing him well mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched.
For you that
are a Logician know,
that as greatnesse of it
selfe is a quantity, so
yet the iudgement of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:10163:51"/>
it, as of mighty riches
&amp; all other strengths
stands in the predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Relation: so
that you cannot tell
what the Queene of
England is able to do
defensively or offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively,
but by through
knowing what they
are able to doe with
whom shee is to bee
matched.</p>
                  <p>This therefore is one
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:10163:52"/>
notable vse of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers;
which stands
in the mixed &amp; cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relatiue
knowledge
of things, in which
kinde comes in the
knowledge of all
legues betwixt Prince
and Prince; the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pographicall
descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of each Country,
how the one lyes by
scituation to hurt or
helpe the other, how
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:10163:52"/>
they are to Sea, well
harbored or not, how
stored with shippes,
how with Reuenue,
how with fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
&amp; Garrisons, how
the people, warlike
trained or kept vnder,
with many other
such warlike conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations;
which as they
confusedly come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my mind, so I, for
want of leisure, hasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:10163:53"/>
set them downe:
But these things, as I
haue said, are of the
first kinde which
stands in the ballan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
one thing with
the other.</p>
                  <p>The other kinde of
knowledge is of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
which stand in the
things which are in
themselus either sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
good or simply e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,
and so serve for a
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:10163:53"/>
right instruction, or a
shunning example.
Of these <hi>Homer</hi> meant
in this verse, <hi>Qui mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos
hominum mores cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouit
et vrbes.</hi> For he
doth not meane by
<hi>Mores,</hi> how to looke,
or put off ones Cap
with a new found
grace, although true
behavior is not to be
despised: marry my
Heresie is, that the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:10163:54"/>
English behaviour is
best in England, and
the Italians in Italie.
But <hi>mores</hi> hee takes
for that from whence
Morall Philosophy is
so called; the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of true discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of mens mindes
both in vertue, passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and vices. And
when he saith, <hi>Cogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit
vrbes,</hi> hee meanes
not (if I be not decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued)
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:10163:54"/>
to have seene
Townes, and marke
their buildings; for
surely houses are but
houses in every place,
they doe but differ <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum
magis et minus;</hi>
but hee intends to
their Religion, Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>awes, bringing
vp of children, disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
both for warre
and peace, and such
like. These I take to
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:10163:55"/>
be of the second kind
which are euer wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to be knowne for
their owne sakes. As
surely in the great
Turke, though wee
have nothing to doe
with them, yet his
Discipline in warre
matters is, <hi>propter se,</hi>
worthy to be learned.
Nay, even in the
kingdome of China,
which is almost as far
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:10163:55"/>
as the Antippodes
from vs, their good
Lawes and Customes
are to be learned: but
to know their riches
and power is of little
purpose for Vs; since
that can neither ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
vs, nor hinder
vs. But in our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
Countries, both
these things are to be
marked, as well the
latter, which containe
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:10163:56"/>
things for themselues
as the former which
seeke to know both
those, and how their
riches and power may
be to vs auaileable, or
otherwise. The Countries
fittest for both
these, are those you are
going into. France a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all other most
needfull for vs to
marke, especially in
the former kind. Next
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:10163:56"/>
is Spaine &amp; the Low-Countries,
then Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many;
which in my
opinion excels all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
as much in the
latter Consideration,
as the other doth in
former, yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are voyd of nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
For as Germany
me <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>inks doth excell
in good lawes and
well administring of
Iustice; so are wee
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:10163:57"/>
likewise to consider
in it the many Princes
with whom we may
have league; the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Frade, and
meanes to draw both
Souldiers and furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
there in time of
need. So on the other
side, as in France and
Spaine we are princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
to marke how
they stand towards
vs both in power and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:10163:57"/>
inclination; so are
they, not without
good and fitting vse,
even in the generality
of wisdome to bee
knowne; As in France
the Courts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
their subulter
Iurisdiction, and the it
continual keeping of
payed Souldiers: In
Spaine, their good &amp;
grave proceedings,
their keeping so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:10163:58"/>
Prouinces vnder
them, and by what
manner; with the
true points of honor.
Wherein since they
haue the most open
conceit wherein they
seeme ouer curious, it
is an easie matter to
cut off when a man
sees the bottom Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
likewise, besides
the neighbour-hood
with vs, and the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:10163:58"/>
considerations
therunto, hath diuers
things to be learn'd,
especially their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerning
their Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
&amp; other trades.
Also for Italy, wee
know not what wee
haue, or can haue to
doe with them, but to
buy their Silkes and
Wines: And as for the
other point, except
Venice, whose good
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:10163:59"/>
Lawes and customes
wee can hardly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
to our selues,
because they are quite
of a contrary gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
there is little
there but tyrannous
oppression, and seruil
yeelding to them that
haue little or no right
ouer them. And for
the men you shall
haue there, although
indeed some be excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:10163:59"/>
learned, yet are
they all giuen to
counterfeit learning:
as a man shall learne
among them more
false grounds of
things then in any
place else I know. For
from a Tapster vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
they are all
discoursers in certain
matters and qualities;
as Horsmanship, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:10163:60"/>
wayting; and
such are better there
then in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries:
But for other
matters, as well (if
not better) you shall
haue them in nearer
places.</p>
                  <p>Now resteth in my
memory but this
point, which indeed
is the chiefe to you of
all others; which is,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:10163:60"/>
the chiefe of what
men you are to direct
your selfe to, for it is
certaine no vessell can
leave a worse taste in
the liquor it contains
than a wrong teacher
infects an vnskilfull
hearer with that
which hardly will e<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uer
out: I will not tel
you some absurdities
I haue heard some
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:10163:61"/>
Trauellers tell; taste
him well before you
drinke much of his
Doctrine And when
you haue heard it, try
well what you haue
heard before you
hold it for a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall;
for one error is
the mother of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand.
But you may
say, how shall I get
excellent men to take
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:10163:61"/>
paines to speake with
me? Truly in few
words; either much
expence or much
humblenesse.</p>
