         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>MY LORD:</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>VPon discoverie of a late motion in some sheetes, I found my booke to have been hitherto but in a trance, which receiving as I thought, (but knew not from whence) a mortal wound before it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the encounter, I gave over long since for downe right dead &amp; buried in the presse. When it recovered spirits enough to crave my hand, I could not denie it so small a courtesie as to helpe it up. In that it lookes not so vivide and fresh complexioned as heretofore it might, it shares-but in the ordinarie effects of such misse-fortune. If resuming what it was speaking a twelve-moneth since, be censured for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinencie to these times, &amp; (it may be) laughed at by some
<pb facs="tcp:99040:3"/>
for prophesying of things past the possibilitie of their suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, the fault may be theirs that disordered the leaves when well suited, and the failing not mine, who undertoke not against all changes of mindes, or alterations of counsels, or preventions of causes running on then visiblie to the same is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues I assign'd them in my conjecture. But these exceptions, My Lord, though they clip the fringe, neither unshape, nor shorten the garment I intended as the proper guise for Scotish Presbyterie to be seene in the very same with that wherein the Rt. Reverend Bishop of London Derrie had well clad her, soone afterward not onelie undecentlie discompos'd, but rent in pieces by the rudenesse of an angrie furie, one of those sixe evil spirits that haunted (in the night of sorrow) with both tempting and terrifying apparitions, His Royal MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>JESTIE and your H. H. at the Hage. From whose prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing violence no rescue could be offered but by repelling the tempest of his language, wherewith he thought to keepe all Antagonists at a distance, and by blowing in his face the fire &amp; stinking sulphure of his breath. If your Lordship please to passe a litle through the smoke, and take no offense at the smell which in a neare approach will be found to be litle of my making, Truth &amp; reason will be beter discerned in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse to entertaine you, as some longer traine of Authoritie had likewise if Fathers &amp; Councels in this pilgrimage of ours had been, to a just number, within my reach, and some later Writers at the pleasure of my call. The stand, or at least some impediment in the march, of these Bloudie Presbyters, which this forlorne hope will, in some likelihood cause for a time may by your Lordship, unpraejudic'd, be taken for an hapie augurie of the absolute defeate unquaestionablie to follow, if occasion require, by a greater strength, and that under the
<pb facs="tcp:99040:3"/>
conduct of beter experience in these polemical affaires. In the interim though I humblie crave the honour and power of your patronage (wherof from your integritie and constancie in Gods cause &amp; the Kings, I praesume), I assume not the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to constitute your Lordship any partie in the libertie I take, beyond forward expressions, to declare what may be thought some singularitie in my sence. If any small Politician, whose conscience is squared by no religion at all but what plainlie lies in the image-worship of his temporal designes. will be (which I must looke for to be) quaestioning the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of my speaches, I thanke God he hath no priviledge to give judgement against the sinceritie of my thoughts. I can no longer conceale, My Lord, how much I am troubled to see our Churches diffusive charitie mistaken, the precious balme, which she ever liberallie poured into the wounds of her neighbours, cast by some of their hands like common oyle upon her domestike flames purpofelie to consume her; And the skirt, she often spread over their nakednesse, cut of, with an unhandsome intent to laugh at her shame, had she not an under garment of innocencie to praevent them. To behold, after so many yeares cantonizing our Religion amongst Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Congregations of different opinions, (reconcil'd in nothing but, or nothing more then in a negative to the Papist) our selves, in the end, at a sad losse for protection (or indeed free permission) from any, now necessitated to seeke it. This makes me so many times in this discourse turne her away from all new names and professions arising whether from <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations</hi> or <hi>Covenants.</hi> to the <hi>unconf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>afest sanctuarie of truth for her doctrine &amp; practice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though she can expect no armed assistance from the dead to maintaine the
<pb facs="tcp:99040:4"/>
distressed Members of her communion. If this must be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted a schismatical inclination, let me be left in my hold upon the hornes of this altar, while others rise from their knees to sit downe, out of good felloship, at the Tables; and drinke of all waters they care not what, so draw'n from a cisterne of the Reformed, forsaking or vilifying, for the time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that clearer Chrystal fountaine of their owne. Whereas would they enter, as they are quaestionlesse obliged, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animous resolution to demand every where the publike exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of their canonical devotion, they would either, upon the grant, reape more comfort in continuing the worship of their Fathers, or, upon unworthie denial, more reason to scruple at such a facile conjunction with them, who disclaiming their <hi>prayers</hi> can not be thought serious when they praetend an <hi>harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie</hi> in that <hi>faith</hi> by which they are exhibited unto God. And (to put your Lordship in minde of a late instance delivered on good credit) who maligning our persons, &amp; mocking at our calamities in their Scholes, are very unlikelie so to alter their mindes as to turne their Barbarous reproach into any bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlie kisse or Christian welcome, when they step but the next doore into their Temples. I confesse, My good Lord, this Magisterial advice may beter become the mouth of some Elder Pastour, who is likelie to have more sheep wandring from his fold then he who can scarce properlie be said to have had any in his charge yet none such, I hope, hath reason to take amisse my modest endeavour, while he is otherwise imployed, to recover those I finde stragling within my call. It being upon due consideration to be feared, that after some few yeares (if there must be yet more of our miserable disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion) with out an universal industrious circumspection of yong and old, as we have broken our pipes, we may throwe
<pb facs="tcp:99040:4"/>
away our whistles, and fold up our time with our armes in ae comfortlesse discourse about the flockes we once had which now alas are got into other pastures; Invite strangers to fight for our <hi>Churches</hi> while our owne Congregations are instituted to forget the holinesse in the separation of such places, the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred distance of the meanest from <hi>worke-or ware-houses,</hi> and the fairest from <hi>Piatz'as</hi> of pleasure or <hi>Exchanges</hi> for their bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaines. If what I speake, My Lord, be truth, I shall not hearken to them that may tell me it is misse placed, my conscience suggesting that the climate &amp; season hath too often been here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore neglected; If false, I have a spunge as readie as ever I had a pinne to wipe out all but my shame, which shall be set forth, at your Lordships pleasure, in an <hi>English sheet,</hi> though it never will be brought unto the <hi>Scotish stoole</hi> to do its pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. In attendance on which sentence, if neither your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships approbation nor pardon must be expected, I stoup downe to acknowledge my selfe, aswell in submission to your censure as execution of your commands:</p>

            <p>And you'le pardon me that I quote <hi>Argenis</hi> in so weighty a cause: <hi>Similes labra lactucas;</hi> they are more fabulous, and greater liars, then <hi>Argenis:</hi> and some sleight, prating, finical <hi>Nicopompus,</hi> I hold a far more proper Antagonist to deal with these men, then you, or any learned grave Divine: For they will say what they please, and maintain what they say, not by strength of reason, but by wilfulness, hate, malice, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, and blood: <hi>Crede, aut jug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Believe, or I'le cut thy throat.

            <p>He had done with my <hi>Lord's Grace of Canterbury</hi> long ago, and it was time, when he and his complices had brought him to a scaffold: But no sooner had my <hi>Lord of London-Derry</hi> appeared in publick, though with some short <hi>avisoes</hi> to beware their villanies, but <hi>Bailey</hi> will have at him: Who but <hi>Baily?</hi> the great <hi>Kill-cow of the North?</hi> that unappall'd Champion? that <hi>Goliath</hi> of brass? that confounder of Bishops in <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland?</hi> He startles, and stares about, at the very name of a <hi>Bishop</hi> reels, frets and fumes; it is more odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to him then a <hi>Turkish Mufti,</hi> it rides him like an <hi>Incubus,</hi> or Night-mare, he cannot rest or sleep for it.</p>

            <p>I Am necessarilie to advertise you, That if you be notvery conversant in the R<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Bishops Warning and his adversaries Review before you enter upon my replie, you will in the end be as unsatisfied about the true state of the controversie, as all the way offended at the incohaerence of the paragraphs or periods in the booke, there being, to ease the Printer, not much to advantage me, very litle inserted that mine relates to, which notwithstanding is penned as if you had the other perpetuallie in your sight. The credit I claime to have given to several histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical circumstances of a Countrey, which I yet never saw, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I could not be furnished from printed bookes, is upon the sufficient assurance I have of the fidelitie and abilitie in such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons as are natives, whom I consulted as oracles in many cases, and received their answer in no darke ambiguitie of words; But layd downe positivelie in their papers, which if their indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence had been the same with mine: I should have published with their names, whereby to put out the envious mans eye and keep curiositie from a troublesome impertinencie in enquirie. I shall make no apologie at all to you for my engagement in the dispute, having allreadie done it where more due. I shall brieflie this for some tantologie, much indecencie and levitie in my language, Desiring the first may be imputed to some necessitie I was cast upon by the Reviewers frequent repetitions, and some difficultie to recollect what expressions had passed from me with the sheetes, most of which I was to part with successivelie as I pennd them at several distances of time and place reteining no perfect copie in my hands. The second is that dirt which did
<pb facs="tcp:99040:10"/>
sticke like pitch unto my fingars while I was handling the fowle Review, and so hath defild my booke. The third came from no affectation to be facetious, for which I am litle fitted, yet thought I might as well sport it as a Divinitie Professour in his chaire, who having it seemes, made hast to the second infancie of his age, or reassumd his first, would never, it may be, have been at quiet, unlesse I had rocked him in his cradle, or play'd a litle with his rattle. The strange misse-takes many times intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by his ignorance of our tongue that in my absence prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared all for the presse are rectified with references to the pages where. Which amendments in favour of your selfe aswell as justice unto me should be at first transplanted to their several colonies by your pen. The Greeke leters that have lost their grace by the Latin habits wherein they are constrained to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, being crowded here and there out of all significancie and order, &amp; so left at large, have their authoritie made good to the full sense of the commission they brought with them, every where by the English Interpreter or Paraphrast when you meet them. Which intimated, I have no greater courtesie to crave from you, if one the Revievers impartial and aequitable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parers, then to hearken to truth and reason, and to signifie what you finde here dissonant from either, which I promise you shall be acknowledged or amended Adieu.</p>

               <hi>offered</hi> you know was <hi>a missive from the Lords</hi> of the Councel, not addressed to them as to an <hi>Assemblie,</hi> &amp; therefore no such <hi>capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie</hi> requir'd <hi>to</hi> their <hi>receiving</hi> it. His Majesties letter to the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners of the general Assemblie signifying his pleasure to have the appointment of this meeting deferred, &amp; no new indiction to be made without his consent, having been long before delivered, &amp; the substance of it by them communicated to the several Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Kingdome. In contempt whereof these persons assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at Aberdene, where, the day before they sate downe, was a publication at the mercate Crosse of a charge to the contrarie from the Lords of the Councel. Beside, <hi>they had not,</hi> His Majestie tells them. <hi>any warrant to hold a new Assemblie, without the praesence either of the Moderatour of the last,</hi> or <hi>of the ordinarie Clerke of the Assemblie.</hi> As for their dutifull demeanour afterward, That they rise immediatelie after the reading of the Missive, Mr. Baylie knowes to be absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie false, Howsoever, the <hi>naming a diet for the next meeting</hi> was against an expresse clause in His Majesties letter, which by the Councel is calld <hi>a Rebellious, &amp; traiterous misbehaviour.</hi>

            <p>For the <hi>trouble</hi> that followed hereupon, if <hi>by the counsel of Arch-Bishop Bancroft,</hi> that could not be <hi>pernicious,</hi> because the proceeding against them was <hi>legal.</hi> They were calld before the Lords of His Majesties Councel; had libertie given them to entertaine lawyers, &amp; make their defense, which prov'd a <hi>Declinatour</hi> disclaiming all subjection to His Majestie, &amp; His Councel; This <hi>Declinatour</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:99040:28"/>
&amp; they were found to have unlawfullie conven'd; His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie commanded that the ordinarie course of justice should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. Whereupon Sixe of them were presented upon panel at Lyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lithgow before His Highnesse Justice being the ordinarie Judge, who had joyned to him a great number of Noblemen, &amp;c. Their inditement grounded upon the first statute in May 1584. Two of<note place="margin">Their obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacie.</note> their Procuratours, &amp; Counsellers at law, not being able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade them to a course of humilitie, did upon their obstinacie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to plead for them, Indeed Sixe, or seven of them, touched with the open discoverie made by the Kings Declaratour, upon hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble submission were dismissed, &amp; sent home to their charge. See more particularlie of all these in the Declarations of K. James, &amp; his Councel 1606.</p>
            <p>The next instance of the Bishops, Viz. <hi>Their abolishing the chiefe festivals of the Church,</hi> the Reviewer can not justifie to any purpose<note place="margin">The Church festivals a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolished in Scotland by no just Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie.</note> either from the <hi>authoritie,</hi> or the <hi>time.</hi> For first this great <hi>Councel of Scotland</hi> were but a <hi>parsel</hi> of the rebell Nobilitie that had of late de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, &amp; persecuted the poore Queen Dowager to the death, And now having the yong King &amp; Queen at as great a distance as France, at the same rate order the affaires of the <hi>Church</hi> as they had the poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the <hi>State.</hi> The <hi>charge</hi> they gave the Assemblie brethren dated the 29. day of April 1590. (the summe whereof is so formallie pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the front of the Discipline) was upon procurement by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, It being ordinairie with them, when they had any new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice on foot, to extort some pretended authoritie by their letters. Therefore it is but a mocke <hi>obedience</hi> by service not onelie offered, but obtruded. Nor was it so pleasing to them, whom they here owne for their masters, but that after many dayes perusal, it was with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slike, &amp; scorne rejected by diverse. Those that sign'd it had no power to ratifie it, no more then just before, the Confession of fayth, which they were faine to send over into France. And how their Act, or promisse in secret Councell, dated the 27. of Ianuarie, was illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from time to time, Knox relates, &amp; very much laments in his sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. For the <hi>time,</hi> there was no such <hi>Parliament intervall</hi> as required the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of the <hi>Councel of State:</hi> for what they call'd a Parliament, though none, was but newlie dissolv'd, when presentlie consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was had how the Church might be established in a good, &amp; God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie policie. The reason of which haste was lest, the yong Queen should come over, &amp; interpose her Royal authoritie in this <hi>great Councel of State,</hi> as she did afterward, &amp; rejected the Discipline, for all the <hi>Act of State</hi> that had passed on it, demanding <hi>How many of those that had sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed would be subject unto it,</hi> &amp; her Secretarie telling them. <hi>That many</hi>

The authoritie of the Church, warranted by the holie Scriptures is sufficient to justifie them, &amp; us in this observance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nor were the Scots so fallen out with these <hi>abominations,</hi> but that they let them stand in the Calendar be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Liturgie, &amp;c. And there were <hi>a people in Scotland</hi> which, in the Bishops dayes, did celebrate those feasts, Therefore <hi>ever since they have not shewed such readie obedience to that direction of the Discipline.</hi> See the Bishop of Brechen's defense of the Perth Articles.</p>
            <p>Your farre-fetecht comparison accidentallie improves the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops knowledge by a seasonable experiment, Who findes the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plinarian barbarismes in <hi>Scotland</hi> as monstrous as any he ever read of in <hi>Iapan,</hi> &amp; your nullities in religion as many as <hi>Vtopia</hi> hath in policie, or nature. If your thoughts had not been rambling so farre for recruits to your malice, you might have been furnish'd with truth nearer home, which His Lordship brings nnto your doore. As fine as here you make your selfe for the <hi>triumph,</hi> out of every wing you plucke, you will by &amp; by be at a losse for your <hi>victorie,</hi> &amp; must then weare your blew cap without a feather. For (that you may know<note place="margin">The Bishop not mistake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie.</note> my meaning) His Lordship can afford you no such pretie thing as the antichronisme you lay hold on. He sayth not, <hi>That statute of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son was in being in the yeare</hi> 1580. And his Printer you might see, had done him so much right as to set a number 4. yeares older directlie, against the place where it <hi>is mention'd.</hi> His Lordships words are these <hi>Which ridiculous ordinance was maintain'd stiffelie by the succeeding Synods, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the statute, That it should be treason to impugne the authoritie of the three Estates.</hi>

            <p>The plaine sense whereof is this, <hi>The succeeding Synods</hi> to the yeare 1584. <hi>maintain'd</hi> it <hi>stiffelie.</hi> And not onelie they but likewise <hi>the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Synods</hi> afterward, notwithstanding <hi>the statute</hi> then made, <hi>That</hi> &amp;c. Yet, not to be too literal, That there should be <hi>three Estates,</hi> to whom your brethren presented their Assemblie Acts as they did, by the King &amp; them to be confirmed, even before the yeare 1580. &amp; yet, That <hi>to impugne the authoritie of the three,</hi> estates or <hi>to procure the innovation,</hi> or <hi>diminution of any of them,</hi> should have no statute nor law to make it, at least interpretative, <hi>treason,</hi> is a peice of politikes that <hi>Iapan,</hi> nor

            <p>What you make here such a positive <hi>consent of Lundie the Kings Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner</hi> in that Assemblie, even now went no farther then a suspense in silence, where all you found was, That <hi>it appear'd not he apposed.</hi>

The conventions of the Ministrie were<note place="margin">Bishops to praeside in them.</note> to be moderated by every Bishop in his Dioecesse, who was, by agreement, to praeside in the Presbyteries with in his limits. So that the modelling Presbyteries was onelie for setling a convenient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue upon the Ministers, &amp; so farre was it from abolishing Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacie, that the Bishops were to have the managing the affaire.</p>

            <p>This Parliament 1584. was summon'd with as loud a voyce as any other, &amp; was as open as the sun at Edenburgh could make it.

This was the regular restoring of Presbyterie, <hi>Which</hi> to say <hi>was never more removed to this day,</hi> in that sense, you must speake it, is to abuse the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of some new convert you have got in the <hi>Indies,</hi> who it may be, at that distance, know not that, Bishops had the visible Church government in Scotland, for about theirtie yeares together, since that time.</p>

He died piouslie, &amp; peaceablie at Westminster in the second yeare of this rebellion, &amp; was buried in the Abbey Church. The second was a great &amp; affiduous preacher, even when he was blinde through extreme age, He also died in peace, &amp; with the good report of all, except these calumniatores, who hold that no Bishop can be an honest man, &amp; whose invention is so rich of nothing as reproaches against better men then themselves.

out of the Sectaries hands, had been the untying of his, &amp; puting him in a posture to give; The bringing him to his Parliament in London, where likewise your own Commissioners resided, had been the seting him in sight of such as were to aske, &amp; receive. Which is the same kind of Logike you us'd in your answer to both Houses of Parliament upon the new propositions of peace, &amp; the 4. bills to be sent 1647. Where I finde your opinion, &amp; judgement to be this, <hi>That the most aequal., fairest, &amp; just way to obtaine a well-grounded peace is by a personal treatie with the King: &amp; that his Majestie for that end be invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to come to London with honour, freedome, &amp; safetie.</hi> For which you offer 6. reasons. 1. <hi>The sending of your propositions without a treatie hath been often essayed without successe</hi> .......

You remember the seven private directions sent to your Presbyteries before the Assemblie at Glasgow 1638. the fourth of which was. <hi>That such as are erroneous in doctrine or scandalous in life, be praesentlie processed that they be not chosen Commissioners, and if they shall hapen to be chosen by the greater part, that all the best affected both Ministers and Elders protest, and come to the Assemblie to testifie the same.</hi> By this tricke you not onelie praejudg'd or praecondemn'd the legal freedome in choyce, but caus'd to be process'd all suspected to be of a different sense from that which you praedesign'd or praescrib'd to the Assemblie.

Who thinke it neither loyaltie nor prudence rather to deliver him up to the hazard, if not assurance, of the axe, then he should by such meanes be delivered from the perill of the sword. <hi>The Kings inclination</hi>
