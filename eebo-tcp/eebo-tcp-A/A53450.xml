            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>SOON after Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s Dissertation came out, I was call'd away into <hi>Ireland,</hi> to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Parliament there. The Publick Business, and my own private affairs, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd me a great while in that Kingdom, else the World should have had a much Earlier account of Him, and his Performance. For tho' He took above two Years to make his Learned Reflections on <hi>Phalaris</hi>; yet Two Months would have been enough to have shown him, that he is but a weak Champion in a very frivolous Cause.</p>
            <p>I speak not this one of any vain design of setting up for a Quick Writer, but meerly to avoid being thought to have thrown away any considerable part of my life upon so triflng a subject: which, as Idle a man as I am, is an Imputation I would not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly lye under.</p>
            <p>I little imagin'd ever to have been engag'd in a Dispute of this nature. I am not very fond of Controversies even where the Points debated are of some importance; but in trivial matters, and such as Mankind is not at all concern'd in, methinks they are unpardonable. This, ever since I came to have any Opinions of my own, has been one of 'em; and is still, tho' I am unluckily at present brought to act contrary to it. But the Case is this — Dr. <hi>Bent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> has been pleas'd, with some warmth, to fall foul on an Edition and Version of <hi>Phalaris</hi>'s <hi>Epistles,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:98199:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that I some years since offer'd to the World. He has taken a great deal of Good-natur'd pains to prove, that I had been very foolishly busying my self upon a Contemptible and Spurious Author; and had made a bad book much worse by a very ill Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. I was very Young, when I appear'd on that occasion; and I appear'd rather as one that wish'd well to Learning than profess'd it; and for both these reasons promis'd my self good usage from the men of more profound Skill in such matters. Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> was sensible that his Criticisms would lye under some disadvantage on this account; and therefore, to excuse his making so free with the Edition, was pleas'd to make yet freer with Me; and, according to His Breeding, to tell Me, and all the World, that I had set my name to a Book, which did not belong to me.</p>
            <p>The first of these Reflections, had it come single, I could easily have neglected: had he stop'd there, I would have left the Book to shift for it self, and Him to the good opinion he has of his own perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, without endeavouring to lessen it. But when he carried his Criticisms so far as to assert, not only of <hi>Phalaris,</hi> but his <hi>Editor</hi> too, that they neither of 'em wrote what was ascrib'd to 'em; he gave me so plain, and so publick an Affront, that I could not, with any tolerable regard to my reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, quietly put it up. Thus was I, much against my inclinations, brought into the Lists. It was necessary for me to say something in defence of my self; and when I did so, I thought it would be judg'd proper for me to say something too in defence of my Author; and to enquire into the justness of those Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticisms which Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> has advanc'd on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion; and which, I foresaw, wou'd be look'd upon, as in some measure aim'd at Me, tho' they did not really belong to me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:98199:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>I have not any where in my Book asserted, that the <hi>Epistles,</hi> which carry <hi>Phalaris</hi>'s name, are Genuine; and I am not therefore engag'd to defend their Reputation against the Attacks of Dr. <hi>Bent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> or any other person, who, by the help of Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and Lexicons, shall set up for a Critic in this point. But as I have not undertaken for their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Genuine, so neither have I, with a decisive and assuming air, pronounc'd 'em Spurious. I express'd my self with that Caution and Reserve in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which I thought became a Young Writer, who was sensible, that the best and ablest Iudges were divided in their opinions about it; and I thought it would be a very Indecent part in Me, to make my self a Iudge between 'em.</p>
            <p>But I was chiefly induc'd to observe these mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, by the Regard I had for the <hi>most Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish'd Writer of the Age,</hi> whom I never think of, without calling to mind those happy Lines of <hi>Lucretius,</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Qnem Tu, Dea, Tempore in omni</l>
                  <l>Omnibus ornatum voluisti excellere rebus.</l>
               </q>
a Character, which, I dare say, <hi>Memmius</hi> did not better deserve, than Sir <hi>William Temple.</hi> He had openly declar'd in favour of the Epistles: and the Nicety of his Taste was never, I think, dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Such as had any themselves. I quoted his Words with that respect which is due to ev'ry thing that comes from him: but must now beg his pardon for it; for I have by this means, I find, drawn him into a share of Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s displeasure: who has hereupon given himself the trouble of writing almost fourscore pages solemnly to disprove that One of Sir <hi>William</hi>'s which he has prefix'd to his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertation; and which, to give him my opinion of his
<pb facs="tcp:98199:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
whole Book at once, is the only good Page there.</p>
            <p>I am therefore the rather inclin'd to give Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s Reflections a Due Examination, on Sir <hi>William Temple</hi>'s account; upon whom I so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily occasion'd this Storm of Criticism to fall. In truth, for a Man who has been so great an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament to Learning, he has had strange usage from Some who are Retainers to it. He had set the world a Pattern of mixing Wit with Reason, Sound Knowledge with Good Manners; and of making the one serve to recommend and set off the other; but his Copy has not been at all follow'd by those that have writ against him, in a very rough way, and without that Respect which was due both to His Character, and their Own.</p>
            <p>I will not pretend to determine, on which side, in those Disputes, the Truth lies; only thus much I will venture to say of 'em, that, let Sir <hi>W. T.</hi> be as much out in some of his Opinions as he's represented to be, yet They, who read both sides, will be apt to fall in with <hi>Tully</hi>'s Opinion of <hi>Plato,</hi> and say, <hi>Cum Illo Ego meherclè errare malim quàm cum istis Scriptoribus vera sentire.</hi> I had rather be so Handsomly mistaken as He is, if he be mistaken, than be so Rudely and Dully in the right, as Some of his Opposers, allowing 'em to be in the right, are.</p>
            <p>There was also another Consideration that deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd me to write. Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s Reflections were understood to go further than either Sir <hi>William Temple,</hi> or my Self; and to be levell'd at a <hi>Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Society,</hi> in which I had the happiness to be edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated: and which Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> is suppos'd to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack under those General Terms of <hi>Our New Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, Our Annotators,</hi> and <hi>Those Great Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius's with whom Learning, that is leaving the world, has taken up her last Residence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:98199:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>By these, and such expressions as these, with which his Familiar Epistle abounds, he would insinuate as if <hi>Phalaris,</hi> as slight a piece as it is, had been made up by contribution from several hands, and were the Ioint Work of that Eminent Body. But in this he does me too great an honour; and I'm almost tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted to take it, as <hi>Terence</hi> did the agreeable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of <hi>Laelius</hi> and <hi>Scipio</hi>'s writing his Plays for him; neither to own nor deny it. But <hi>Terence</hi> wrote what might have become those Noble Pens; and therefore did no injury to their Reputation when he favour'd that mistake: whereas I shou'd be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly to blame, if I shou'd suffer a Report to spread to the disadvantage of so many Excellent Men. I think my self therefore oblig'd to declare, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Faults of <hi>Phalaris</hi> are, they are Mine; and I alone am answerable for them. There is a very Deserving Gentleman indeed, who had a little before been the Director of my Studies, and was then My Particular Friend, to whom I have acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to make on his occasion. I consulted him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any difficulty, because I thought it not proper for one of my Age to offer any thing to the Public with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out consulting Some-body. I wish I had advis'd of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tener with him, for then my Book would have been much more correct. But excepting Him, no one had a hand in it; nay, scarce a line was ever seen by any-body else as I know of, till it was finish'd And now I have confess'd thus much, I don't care if I own a little further to Dr. <hi>Bentley,</hi> that I have been again oblig'd to the Same person for his Assistance in consulting some Books in the <hi>Oxford Libraries</hi> at my request, which in the Places where I have been were not at all, or not easily, to be met with. The Dr. may make what advantages of this he thinks fit; I assure him, I will never recriminate;
<pb facs="tcp:98199:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for I declare to the World, that I sincerely believe the Dr's Dissertation is entirely his own, both as to Matter and Dress; and that no Friend whatever, no not Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> himself, had any hand in it. The happy Genius of some Authors will for ever secure 'em from all Scandals of this nature: <hi>Terence</hi> indeed was suspected, but <hi>Bavius</hi> and <hi>Moevius</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were. Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> has industriously contriv'd to lead his Reader into this mistake; imagining, I suppose, that the Conquest would have been too cheap for a man of his Rank in Letters, unless he engag'd, like the Hero of a Romance, with great numbers at once. But some men have thought themselves He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes that were not, and some that were, have mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken their Strength; and in either of these cases have come off but scurvily. The Dr, I'm sure, would have been made very sensible of this in the present Debate, had not I been kinder to him than He was to Himself, and stept in, as I thought it became me, between Him and the just resentments of that Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Body. 'Twere pity that any of those worthy Men, who know so well how to employ their hours, should be diverted from the pursuit of Vseful Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, into such Trivial Enquiries as these. The Dispute began between Dr. <hi>Bentley,</hi> and Me; and 'tis fit that We Two should end it.</p>
            <p>I have a Request to Such as shall give themselves the Trouble of perusing These Papers, that they would do <hi>Me,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Bentley,</hi> the Iustice to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare 'em, Paragraph by Paragraph, with His Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertations. The Task is a little unreasonable, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the Length of the Dispute; but 'tis necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in order to form a true judgment of the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance.</p>

            <head>Dr. BENTLEY'S Dissertation UPON THE Epistles of <hi>Phalaris,</hi> &amp;c. EXAMIN'D.</head>
            <p>DR. <hi>Bentley,</hi> in the Piece I am about to examine, among several other Liberties, has taken this, of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting without any Method. Great Genius's indeed are above ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Rules: but it wou'd ill become so unknown a Writer as I am, to exempt my self from 'em; and therefore I shall prescribe my self a method in answering him.</p>
            <p>I think most of the scatter'd Remarks he has made, in that part of his Dissertation which relates to <hi>Phalaris,</hi> will come under one of these Three Heads; They are either some <hi>Arguments,</hi> which he has urg'd for the <hi>Spuriousness</hi> of the <hi>Epistles</hi>; or some <hi>Faults</hi> which he has found with my <hi>Edition</hi> and <hi>Version</hi> of 'em; or some <hi>Matters of Fact</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:98199:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which he has related, as the Grounds of his peevish Quarrel.</p>
            <p>These last he has thrown into an odd corner of his Book, as it were out of sight; and plac'd 'em in the Rear of all his lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Arguments. One wou'd imagine, by the Post he has given 'em, that he distrusted their strength, or that he wrote his Book first, and found Reasons for it afterwards. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that may be, I think my self oblig'd to clear up this Point in the first place, by setting those <hi>Matters of Fact</hi> in their true light, which Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> has extreamly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis'd: And then 'twill be time to consider the <hi>Wonderful Proofs</hi> he has produc'd on his side, and the <hi>Mighty Mistakes</hi> he has thought fit to charge me with.</p>
            <p>About four or five Years ago, the worthy Dean of <hi>Christchurch,</hi> Dr. <hi>Aldrich,</hi> (of whose College I was then a Member) desir'd me to undertake an Edition of <hi>Phalaris.</hi> I cou'd deny Him nothing, to whom I ow'd so much; and therefore, as unfit as I thought my self for such a Task, I undertook it. In order to it, a Manuscript <hi>Phalaris</hi> in the <hi>King's Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary</hi> was to be consulted. It was of no Age or Worth, I heard, being written but just before the restauration of Letters; however it was a Manuscript, and therefore not to be neglected; especially since we had no ancient Copies, either in <hi>England,</hi> or any where else, that I cou'd hear of. I sent to Mr. <hi>Bennet,</hi> my Bookseller in <hi>London,</hi> to get the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script, and desir'd him to apply himself to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98199:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Dr. <hi>Bentley,</hi> in my name, for the use of it; not doubting in the least a ready complyance with such a request, from one of his Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Order; and who besides was at that very time in a Lecture of some Honour and Profit that had lately been set up by one of my Family: especially, since the Book, which I desir'd to borrow, was of so little importance, that it had scarce been a Favour to have lent it me, if I had not ask'd it. After an Expectation of many months, Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> sent me at last a Collation of part of the Manuscript, with this account; that he had, with a great difficulty, and after long delays, got the Manuscript into his hands; that he had it but a very few days, when Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> came to demand it again; and wou'd, by no means, be prevail'd upon to let him have the use of it any longer, tho' he told him, the Collation was not perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and that he deny'd this Request in a very rude manner, throwing out several slight and disparaging Expressions, both of me, and the Work I was about.</p>
            <p>This I had reason to take very ill of Dr. <hi>Bentley,</hi> and therefore in that part of my <hi>Preface,</hi> where I gave an account of the MSS. that were consulted in that Edition, I inser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted these words, [<hi>Collatas etiam curavi us<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>

               <hi>in Bibliothecâ Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giâ; cujus mihi copiam ulteriorem Bibliothecarius, pro singulari suâ humanitate, negavit.</hi>] which, considering the usage I had had from him, was as soft a thing as I cou'd well allow my self to say. The Epistles were no sooner publish'd, but Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> sent me a Letter;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98199:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
wherein, after expressing himself with great civility to me, he represented the Matter of Fact quite otherwise than I had heard it. I return'd him immediately as civil an Answer, to this effect: That Mr. <hi>Bennet,</hi> whom I em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd to wait on him in my name, gave me such an account of his Reception, that I had reason to apprehend my self affronted: and, since I cou'd make no other excuse to my Reader, for not collating the King's MS. but because 'twas deny'd me, I thought I cou'd do no less than express some resentment of that Denial. That I shou'd be very much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd if Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> had dealt so ill with me, as to mislead me in his accounts; and, if that appear'd, shou'd be ready to take some op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of begging his pardon: and, as I remember, I express'd my self so, that the Dr. might understand, I meant to give him satisfaction as publickly as I had injur'd him. Here the matter rested, and I thought Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> was satisfied; especially since, I found, Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> persisted in his account, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported it with further proofs; and the Dr. seem'd willing to let the Dispute drop, by his not writing to me any further about it, or discoursing Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> concerning it, to whom my Letter plainly refer'd him. In this Mistake was I, for Two Years and an half after the Edition of <hi>Phalaris</hi>; till at last Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s Dissertation came out, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd me, that he had had Vengeance in his Heart all the time, and suspended his Blow only till he cou'd strike, as he thought, to purpose. In this angry. Discourse of his, he tells the World the same story (bating a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98199:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
or two which he has alter'd) that he had told me before in his Letter. His words are these: <hi>A Bookseller came to me in the name of the Editors, to beg the use of the Manuscript. It was not then in my custody: but as soon as I had the power of it,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 68.</note> 
               <hi>I went voluntarily and offer'd it him, bidding him tell the Collator not to lose any time; for I was short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to go out of Town for two Months. 'Twas deliver'd, us'd, and return'd: Not a word said by the Bearer, nor the least suspicion in me, that they had not finish'd the Collation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Startled at these Assertions thus reviv'd, after a long Silence, and improv'd in Print, I examin'd Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> again very strictly and particularly. He assur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d me, that every word he had writ to me upon this occasion was punctually true; and that Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s account, where it differ'd from his, was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely false. He drew up the Matter of Fact in writing, and set his Hand to it; gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving me liberty to make it publick, and to assure the World, that he was ready to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie the truth of what he had written with his Oath, when it shou'd be duly requir'd of him. He added, that Mr. <hi>Gibson,</hi> the Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, cou'd confirm some circumstances of his Account; and that his Brother (who was his Apprentice at that time, and was sent by him both to Dr. <hi>Bentley,</hi> and to the Collator) wou'd have attested the Truth of the Whole, had he been alive; but he dy'd some Months after this Matter happen'd. However, if his own Testimony, and the Collator's, shou'd be liable to Suspicion, yet still there was a Gentleman of known Credit in the World,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98199:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Dr.</hi> King <hi>of the Commons,</hi> who was witness to all that pass'd at one meeting, between him and Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>; and wou'd, he hop'd, be so just to him as to give an account of it. He was not mistaken; for Dr. <hi>King,</hi> being apply'd to by a Friend of mine, presently wrote him the following Letter: which, together with the several Certificates of Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> and Mr. <hi>Gibson,</hi> I here offer to the Reader.</p>

                  <p>I was imploy'd by the Honourable Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> (and by him only) to borrow the MS. of <hi>Phalaris</hi> from Dr. <hi>Bentley.</hi> After about <hi>Nine Months</hi> sollicitation, it was deliver'd into my custody, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any time limited for the return of it. Within <hi>few days</hi> after, Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> call'd upon me, to have it restor'd, and Then told me, that he was to go into the Country. He staid till I sent to the Collator, and word was brought by the Messenger, <hi>that it was not collated.</hi> I then beg'd him to let me have it but till Sunday Morning, (it was Saturday Noon when he came) and I engag'd to oblige the Collator to sit up all Saturday Night, to get it finish'd. But he utterly refus'd to leave it with me any longer, demanding to have it sent that Day to <hi>Westminster,</hi> (which was done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly) and not giving me any the least hopes,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98199:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that if I apply'd to him upon his return out of the Country, I shou'd have leave to get the Collation perfected. These Circumstances I am thus parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular in, because I had occasion to recollect 'em not long afterwards, when Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s Book came out, and Letters pass'd between him and Dr. <hi>Bent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> concerning the Passage in his Preface.</p>
                  <p>It may not be proper, considering my Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for me to add an account of the Reflections. Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> was pleas'd to make from time to time, when I spoke to him from Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> for the Vse of the MS. He has represented me as having said too much on that subject. But, by good fortune, Dr. <hi>King</hi> was present at one of the Meetings, and heard all that pass'd there. I hope he will do Iustice on this occasion.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:98199:9"/>The Case then between me and Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> stands thus. There is, on the one side, Dr. <hi>Bently</hi>'s single Assertion, in his own cause; and these several concurring Accounts, from Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of Probity and Worth, on the other. The question now is (if it be a question) which of these ought to be credited; the Point to me is so clear, that I dare trust the most partial Friend Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> has to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine it.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> and Mr. <hi>Gibson,</hi> I think, are so little interested in this Dispute, that they may be entirely depended upon. However, Dr. <hi>King</hi> is a Witness without Exception; and the account he gives of one of those <hi>Free Conferences</hi> Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> held with Mr. <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,</hi> is full and home; and I do assure our Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Critic, that whatever becomes of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laris</hi>'s Letters, this of Dr. <hi>King</hi>'s is not spu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious. I have the Original of it by me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his own hand, as I have the Originals too of the other Papers, which shall be at Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s, or any man's service, that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to command a sight of 'em.</p>
            <p>And now had I not reason to say what I did, and much more than I did, of Dr. <hi>Bentley,</hi> in my Preface to <hi>Phalaris?</hi> Cou'd I resent the harsh Treatment he had given me in Gentler Terms than I there made use of? Since he had deny'd me so common a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and spoken of me with so much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, I was at Liberty, I think, to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd his Civilities in what way I pleas'd, and to have given him any Language what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that it was not below me to give. And
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98199:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that is a Restraint which, I hope, I shall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be able to lay upon my self, whatever the Provocation be.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> then, considering all things, was really oblig'd to me, for using him with so much Tenderness. What way did he take of owning his Obligations? He immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enter'd upon the Honourable and Christian Design of exposing me; and resolv'd, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Time or Pains it might cost him, to prove, that the Epistles I had put out were a ridiculous Cheat; and that I (or whoever the Editor was) was to be pity'd, for giving my self so much trouble about them.</p>
            <p>I see Monsiour <hi>Rochfaucant</hi> drew his Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation from Nature, when he said, <hi>We often pardon those that injure us, but we can never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give those that we injure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In about two or three years time he had atchiev'd this mighty Work, and compass'd a Dissertation as big as <hi>Phalaris</hi> it self, to make his Point good. There, that he might be wanting in no instance of <hi>Humanity,</hi> he tells the World, that the Edition of <hi>Phalaris</hi> was not mine, but only <hi>ascrib</hi>'d to me; and, be it whose it would, that 'twas a faulty and a foolish one: and then tells me too, in the same breath, that nothing of this was <hi>intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a disparagement to me</hi>; to show his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, I suppose, that he had as mean an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of my Understanding, as he had of my Learning. He names me not indeed, but in his civil way of Circumlocution, calls me, <hi>That young Gentleman of great hopes whose Name is set to the Edition.</hi> But what great hopes cou'd the World have had of a young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98199:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
who shou'd have suffer'd the Lye to be publickly given him, in a matter, where his Reputation, both as a Scholar and a Man of Honour, was nearly concern'd, and yet had either not Sense enough to discern the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front, or not Spirit enough to resent it?</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> was not satisfied with giving me ill Usage, unless he did it in ill Words too; and therefore has cull'd out the very worst he cou'd find, to bestow on me: for surely no man of Liberal Education cou'd put together so many unmannerly and slovenly expressions without studying for 'em. He charges me with <hi>Calumny</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">p. 66.</note>, <hi>weak Detraction</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">p. 66.</note>, <hi>Injustice</hi>

               <note n="a" place="margin">p. 66.</note>; with the <hi>basest Tricks</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">p. 71.</note>, and a <hi>vile Aspersion</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">p. 71.</note>: He tells me, that a certain Person, <hi>tho' a sorry Critic, was yet a degree above me</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">p. 75.</note>; and, that <hi>Printing is a Sword in the hand of a Child</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">p. 67.</note>; meaning, I suppose, his humble Servant.</p>
            <p>He likens me, by a very elegant Simily, to a <hi>Bungling Tinker mending Old Kettles</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">p. 76.</note>, in one place; and, by the help of a Greek Proverb, calls me downright <hi>Ass</hi> 
               <note n="f" place="margin">p. 74.</note> in another. The correcting the faults of my Version is, in his polite way of writing, <hi>the cleansing of</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geas<hi>'s Stables</hi>; and, to carry on the Metaphor, he says, <hi>The First Epistle cost him four Pages in scouring.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These are the Flowers, which Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> has, with no very sparing hand, strew'd throughout every Page almost of his Learned Epistle. It can hardly be imagin'd, how one, that lives within the Air of a Court, shou'd prevail with himself to deal in such dirty Language: the Chairmen at St. <hi>Iames</hi>'s, I
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98199:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
dare say, manage their Disputes with more decency. I find the Dr. has not profited much by the dependence he once had on a <hi>Great Man,</hi> who might have taught him, wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d he have vouchsaf'd to learn it, the Secret of engaging deep with an Adversary, without Loss of Temper, or Breach of Good Manners.</p>
            <p>But he will tell me, that few, or none of these exprssions were levell'd at Me; and that for a very obliging reason; because I am not included among the <hi>Editors</hi> of <hi>Phala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</hi> Let 'em have been levell'd at whom he will, they are inexcusable. Chew'd Bullets are not more against the Law of Arms, than such ways of speech are against the rules of good writing.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Bently</hi> cou'd not have taken a better way of justifying me in what I said of him, than by writing in this manner he has done; and with so little of that <hi>Humanity,</hi> the want of which I objected to him. Most Readers will be apt to think that he might proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly always want it as much as they see he does now. So that if I needed further Vou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers than those which I have already brought, I wou'd call in his own Dissertation to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that I have not wrong'd him, nor given him any Character but what he has since been courteously pleas'd to make good.</p>
            <p>But Dr. <hi>Bently</hi> appeals from me to more Equitable Judges; and tells me, that he <hi>can produce several Letters from Learned Professors abroad,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 68.</note> 
               <hi>(whose Books in time I may be fit to read) wherein these very same words</hi> [pro singulari
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98199:11"/>
suâ humanitate] <hi>are said of him seriously and candidly. For I endeavour</hi> (says he) <hi>to oblige even Foreigners by all Courtesie and Humanity; much more wou'd I encourage and assist any use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful design at home.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But why must we go to Foreign Nations for a true account of Dr. <hi>Bently?</hi> I thought Mens Characters had been best learnt from those among whom they convers'd. The Law of <hi>England</hi> is, that every man shall be try'd by his Country and his Neighbourhood: and this is not more reasonable in the Case of Life and Death, than in that of Reputation. But Dr. <hi>Bently</hi> pleads to have a Jury of Foreign Professors impanell'd to sit upon him: a very suspicious Defence, I think; and which ought, without any more ado, to condemn him. Shou'd a man tax'd with ill breeding here at <hi>London</hi> (where he has liv'd all his time) produce Certificates in his behalf from some Correspondents in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> or <hi>Cumberland,</hi> wou'd this Plea pass at Court? Granting Dr. <hi>Bently</hi>'s Foreigners to have said those things of him which he says they have, 'tis because they are Foreigners; We, that have the happiness of a near conversation with him, know him better; and may perhaps take an opportunity of setting those mistaken Strangers right in their Opinions concerning him.</p>
            <p>Thus much, upon the Supposition that he has these Testimonials by him: but I, who have had some dealings with him, have learnt a little to mistrust his accounts; and shall therefore, before I make any more Remarks upon this passage, tell the Reader a Story.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:98199:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>There was, not many Years ago, a Dispute about a Point of History, between an Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Gentleman and a <hi>Learned Prelate</hi> of our Church, well known to Dr. <hi>Bently.</hi> When the Gentleman was at a loss for Proofs, his last resort always was to a certain Chest at <hi>Ilcomkill,</hi> where there were MSS. it seems, never seen by any body besides himself, that prov'd every thing he had a mind to. This presently put an end to the Controversie: for there was no disputing against Invisible Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities. How far this may be Dr. <hi>Bently</hi>'s case, and whether the Letters from Learned Professors abroad, which he talks of, may not lye in some such Chest as those Records lay in, I will not pretend to determine. However, since they are MSS. I know his Fondness for those precious Jewels so well, that I believe he'l be shy of making 'em publick. Till he does, the Printed Proofs that have been given of his great <hi>Humanity</hi> will stand good against what he tells us has been written to him.</p>
            <p>Sure I am, there are some Learned Men abroad, that are far from Complimenting him. One of 'em, a Man of great note, has complain'd to me, how ill he has been us'd by him, in a Case nearly resembling mine; and complain'd in very expressive Terms; which, not yet having his Leave for it, I do not think my self at liberty to publish.</p>
            <p>Another, that was desirous to have a sight of the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> MS. and apply'd himself to Dr. <hi>Bently</hi> very earnestly for it, met with no other Answer to his Request, but that <hi>the Library was not fit to be seen.</hi> A pretty
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98199:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Excuse for a Library-keeper to make, who had been four Years in that Service! And this Instance of his <hi>Humanity,</hi> I assure him, is of no Old date; it happen'd since he purg'd himself in his new Dissertation, and gave Learned Men encouragement to expect better usage.</p>
            <p>If he goes on at this rate, as we have no reason to doubt but he will, Foreigners will begin to suspect, whether we have, as we pretend, the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> MS. or indeed whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the King has any Library.</p>
            <p>But because the Dr. strongly argues from <hi>his being ready to oblige even Foreigners by all Courtesie and Humanity,</hi> that he wou'd <hi>much more be ready to do so to Learned Men at home:</hi> I will add one Domestick Instance of that kind; that my Instances may be every way as large as his Assertions.</p>
            <p>I have now a Letter by me under the hand of Sir <hi>Edward Sherburn,</hi> (a Gentleman of known Worth and Learning) wherein he has these words; <hi>I have sent</hi> Rubenius<hi>'s Book,</hi> [<hi>de vitâ Mallii,</hi> put out by <hi>Graevius</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> and dedicated to Dr. <hi>Bently</hi>] <hi>the honour of whose Publication Mr.</hi> Bently <hi>hath ungratefully robb'd me of.</hi> The meaning of this is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd in a Latin <hi>Memorandum</hi> enter'd by Sir <hi>Edward</hi> in the Book it self; where he says, that <hi>he put the MS. into Dr.</hi> Bently<hi>'s hands, under this Condition, that he shou'd send it to</hi> Graevius <hi>to be publish'd, letting him know from whence he had it, and desiring him to make an honourable mention of him, as the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that had oblig'd the World with it. The Edition came out, it was dedicated to Dr.</hi> Bent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98199:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>the honour of the Publication given to him; and not one word of Sir</hi> Edward Sherburn <hi>said in it.</hi> The Sophists are every where pelt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Dr. <hi>Bently,</hi> for putting out what they wrote in other mens names; but I did not expect to hear so loudly of it from one that has so far outdone 'em: For, I think, 'tis much worse to take the honour of another man's Book to one's self, than to entitle ones own Book to another man.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Graevius,</hi> it may be, was in fault; and forgot to do Sir <hi>Edward Sherburn</hi> justice. 'Tis hardly to be imagin'd he cou'd, had Dr. <hi>Bent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> told him plainly, that the MS. was put into his hands under that express Condition: But if the Dr. only gave some slight inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of it, <hi>Graevius</hi> might indeed forget to do what he did not know whether it were in good earnest expected of him, or not.</p>
            <p>But supposing the original Omission to have lain wholly at <hi>Graevius</hi>'s door, yet how came the Dr. to be so very quiet under it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards? Why did he not send immediately to Sir <hi>Edward Sherburn</hi> to excuse it? Why did he not take care to have this Neglect repair'd in the next <hi>Holland</hi> Journal? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this was done; and therefore, shou'd the Dr. not have been the willing occasion of the Mistake, yet at least he was very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that it shou'd prevail.</p>
            <p>Upon a view of this Story, I am apt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract my Suspicions about Dr. <hi>Bently</hi>'s Letters from Learned Professors. He may perhaps have Testimonials of his Courtesie by him,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98199:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
if he sticks at no methods of procuring 'em: By such Arts as these 'tis easie for a Man to get a Reputation of <hi>Humanity</hi> abroad, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deserving to be much commended for his Honesty at home. 'Tis an hard word, and which I should not easily allow my self to use, but that I think I may take a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Liberty in another man's behalf, than in my own.</p>
            <p>By Dr. <hi>Bently</hi>'s way of treating Sir <hi>William Temple,</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Sherburn,</hi> and my self, one would imagine, that he had vow'd hostility to all Gentlemen pretending to Letters; that he thought they broke in upon a Trade which none but those of the Body corporate of Profess'd Scholars ought to deal in; and so, looking upon 'em as the <hi>East-India</hi> Company does upon Interlopers, was resolv'd to use 'em accordingly.</p>
            <p>By this time, the Reader is able to judge, how far my Character of Dr. <hi>Bently</hi> suits him, and how far he might justly expect to have that Character publickly given him; whether his <hi>Humanity</hi> be <hi>Singular,</hi> or not, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my Opinion be Singular concerning it. I hope I have now set the <hi>Matters of Fact</hi> in a true light; I have only some few Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks to add on some Passages in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which Dr. <hi>Bently</hi> tells of this matter, in which either his Memory or his Sincerity fail'd him.</p>
            <p>He begins his Account with a great (and I had almost said a wilful) Mistake: He says I have told the World in my Preface, that <hi>I had Collated the King's MS. as far as the</hi> 40<hi>th Epistle, and would have done so throughout, but
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98199:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that the Library-keeper, &amp;c.</hi> Whereas I told the World, not that <hi>I had Collated that MS.</hi> but that <hi>I had taken care to get it Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.</hi> My words are, <hi>Collatas etiam</hi> [viz. Epistolas] <hi>curavi cum</hi> MS<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 
               <hi>in Bibliothecâ Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giâ,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Difference here, as slig<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ht as it may seem, is material; and Dr. <hi>Bently,</hi> one may guess, was aware of it. He saw very well, that, unless I was represented as having col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated the King's MS. <hi>my self,</hi> he could not well lay the Mistakes of the Collation upon me; which he was resolv'd however to do to the utmost, and therefore gave that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Turn to his Matter of Fact at the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, which might best serve to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance his Criticisms that follow.</p>
            <p>With this View, he makes an unfair and broken citation of my words in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin; placing there only thus much out of my Preface, [<hi>MSo</hi> 
               <hi>in Bibliothecâ Regiâ, cujus mihi copiam ulteriorem Bibliothecarius, pro singulari suâ humanitate, negavit</hi>] and taking no notice of the words that introduce these, [<hi>Collatas etiam curavi cum</hi>] without which the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is imperfect, and unintelligible.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Bently</hi> could not have given us a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Earnest of his Integrity, at his first set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out: The rest of his Account, we shall find, is wrote with the same degree of Truth and Fairness. <hi>The true Story</hi> (says he) <hi>is thus: A Bookseller came to me in the name of the Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, to beg</hi> (he would say, <hi>desire</hi>) <hi>the use of the MS.</hi> He knows very well, that Mr. <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi> went to him in my name only; Mr. <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi> himself is positive in the point: but least
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98199:14"/>
the Dr. should deny it, I have, by good luck, preserv'd so much of his Letter by me, as relates to this Particular. There he was pleas'd to use these Civil Expressions: <hi>Mr.</hi> Bennet <hi>desir'd me to lend him the Manuscript</hi> Phalaris, <hi>to be collated, because a Young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, Mr.</hi> Boyle <hi>of</hi> Christchurch, <hi>was going to publish it. I told him, that a Gentleman of that Name and Family, to which I had so many Obligations, and shou'd always have an honour for, might command any Service that lay in my Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now he says, that Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> came to him in the Name of the <hi>Editors.</hi> How came I to be multiply'd at this rate? unless he has recollected himself since, and remembers the little Circumstances of this Transaction better at two or three Years distance, than he did immediately after it happen'd.</p>
            <p>He proceeds in his <hi>True Story. — It was not then in my Custody; but as soon as I had the power of it, I went voluntarily, and offer'd it him.</hi> What he means by its <hi>not being in his Custody,</hi> whether that he had lent it to some-body else, or that he was not yet fully enter'd on his Office, or that he had it not in his Pocket, must be a Secret, till he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to explain himself. Whatever his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be, the Reader is desir'd to take notice, that there was about Nine Months Sollicitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us'd to procure it: A longer time than he needed to retrieve it out of the Hands of Those to whom he might have lent it, or than the Ceremony of his Inauguration to his Library-keeper's Place cou'd require. I'm sure he was much nimbler with my Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:98199:15"/>
for, instead of <hi>Nine Months,</hi> he would not allow him <hi>Nine Days</hi> time to peruse it in.</p>
            <p>His next words are, <hi>bidding him tell the Collator not to lose any time,</hi> (which, transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into English, is, <hi>bidding him let the Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor know, that</hi> he <hi>must not lose any time</hi>) <hi>for I was shortly to go out of Town for two Months.</hi> This, I have reason to think, is pure Ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> remembers nothing of it: but he very well remembers, that when the Dr. came to demand the MS. of him agen, he <hi>then</hi> told him, he was to go into the Country, and gave that for his reason why he could allow him no further time to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late it in. It was a mighty Treasure it seems; the Credit of the King's Library de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> MS. and That; and therefore he would not trust it out of those Walls a day longer. Besides, (which is a Circumstance, that tho' Dr. <hi>Bently</hi> has, yet Dr. <hi>King</hi> has not forgotten) <hi>had it been collated, it would have been worth nothing for the future.</hi> This was an Objection not to be got over, especially since Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> had no Orders from me to take the proper way of removing it.</p>
            <p>It follows, <hi>'twas deliver'd, us'd, and return'd, not a word said by the Bearer, nor the least suspicion in me, that they had not finish'd the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</hi> This is roundly averr'd; but the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der has Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi>'s and Mr. <hi>Gibson</hi>'s Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates; and after comparing 'em with this Passage, may believe as he thinks fit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:98199:15"/>
               <hi>Well,</hi> (says he) <hi>the Collation, it seems, was sent defective to</hi> Oxon, <hi>and the blame, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, laid upon me.</hi> Does he only <hi>suppose</hi> it? Did not I positively write him word, that it was laid upon him, and so laid upon him, that I was oblig'd to take notice of it? But he is to be excus'd for forgetting what I wrote to him, when it appears, that he has forgot what he himself wrote to me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>After a few Months, out comes the new Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with this Sting in the mouth of it. 'Twas a Surprize indeed to find there, that our MS. was not peru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>'d. Our MS!</hi> that is, His Majesty's and Mine. I thought indeed by the Price Dr. <hi>Bently</hi> set upon the MS. he fancied himself to have some Interest in it: He speaks out now, 'tis no longer the King's, but <hi>Our MS. i. e.</hi> Dr. <hi>Bently</hi>'s and the King's in common: An Expression as much too familiar for a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary-keeper, as <hi>Ego &amp; Rex Meus</hi> was for a Cardinal. I will not, for the future, so nicely observe his Indecencies, since I find he is so general and undistinguishing in 'em.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>'Twas a Surprize indeed to find there, that our MS. was not perus'd. Could they not have ask'd for it agen then after my Return?</hi> Yes, I could, Sir, and have been deny'd it again, which I was not very willing to venture. I neither thought my self so little, nor Dr. <hi>Bently</hi> so great, nor the MS. so consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, that I should make a second Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication for it after such a Repulse; no, not tho' I had been sure of obtaining it: much less could I ever think of asking it
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98199:16"/>
agen, when, by what Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> had told me, I had all the reason in the world to think, I should be agen deny'd it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But there is a reason for every thing,</hi> (says the Dr.) and <hi>the Mystery was soon reveal'd!</hi> A pretty decent Phrase on so light an occasion; but this is not the only instance, where the Critick has got the better of the Divine. Well, but how was the <hi>Mystery reveal'd?</hi> why, <hi>He had the hard Hap, it seems, in some private Conversation, to say, that the Epistles were spurious, and unworthy of a new Edition: Hinc Illae Lachrymae.</hi> If he said this, as he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates he did, at <hi>Oxford,</hi> where the Book was then printing, he said a very uncivil thing; and what, in his Dialect, he terms his <hi>Hard Hap,</hi> other People would be apt to call his <hi>Ill Breeding.</hi> However, I seriously declare I was utterly a stranger to this Discourse of his, till he told me of it in Print. I might hear, perhaps, of his being in <hi>Oxford,</hi> but I had heard too much of his Discourse with Mr. <hi>Bennet,</hi> to be curious in making any En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries into his private Conversation.</p>
            <p>The Reader will excuse this Tedious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scant on Dr. <hi>Bently</hi>'s Relation of Matter of Fact. <hi>The true Story of our MS.</hi> was a point of importance: my Honesty was concern'd in this part of the Dispute, the rest only touches my Learning. Having therefore, I hope, justified my Conduct where it most be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came me to do it, the Matters of pure Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticism will give me no Concern, I'm sure, tho' they may put me to some little Trouble. I shall enter upon 'em with the Indifference of a Gamester, who plays but for a trifle,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98199:16"/>
which 'tis much the same to him whether he wins or loses.</p>
            <p>I shou'd now fall closely to my work, the Authority of <hi>Phalaris</hi>'s Epistles, but that there is an Introduction of Dr. <hi>Bently</hi>'s that lies in my way, and must first have a Reflexion or two bestow'd upon it.</p>
            <p>He begins it with telling us, <hi>that Mr.</hi> Wotton, <hi>by the power of a long Friendship be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 'em, engag'd him to write it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I hope Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> will let the Publick know, that he neither engag'd his Friend to write upon this Subject in this manner, nor approv'd of these Discourses, when written: which the World will presume him to have done, till the contrary appears; and till he has disclaim'd Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s attempt as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly, as he seems now to countenance and avow it. 'Tis a little strange, that Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> in a second Edition of his Book, which he had discreetly taken care to purge of most things that look'd like ill Manners in himself, shou'd be prevail'd upon to allow a place to the ill Manners of another man. But I hear, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I am not unwilling to think, that Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> receiv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d this Present at a venture from Dr. <hi>Bently,</hi> and let it be printed without giving himself the trouble of reading it. And I the rather fall in with this account, because I find Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> in his Book <note n="*" place="margin">P. 415, &amp; 416.</note> zealously vindicating the Age from the Imputation of Pedantry, and assuring us, that tho' the Citation of Scraps of Latin, and a nauseous ostentation of Reading were in fashion Fifty or Sixty Years ago, yet that all that is now in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure disus'd. Which I suppose he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:98199:17"/>
have done in some of the last Pages of his Book, if he had then known of the Disser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation that immediately follows it.</p>
            <p>A Gentleman of my acquaintance was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving to me, what a Motly, Unequal work, these two Pieces made, as they now lye to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> (said he) in his Reflections takes in the whole compass of Ancient and Modern Learning; and endeavours to show wherein either of 'em has been defective, and wherein they have excell'd. A Large Design, fit for the Pen of my Lord <hi>Bacon!</hi> and in the well executing of which any one Man's Life would be usefully spent! Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> comes after him with a Dissertation, half as big as his Book, to prove, that three or four small Pieces ascrib'd to some of the Ancients, are not so ancient as they pretend to be: a very inconsiderable Point; and which a wise man would grudge the throwing away a weeks thought upon, if he could gain it! and what then shall we say of Him, that has spent two or three years of his life, to lose it? Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to write was, he tells us, a piece of Publick Service that he hop'd he might do the World; Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s plainly a private Picque, and such as 'twas utterly unfit for him to act upon, either as a Scholar, or a Christian; much more as he was one in Holy Orders, and that had undertaken the publick defence of Religion. Mr <hi>W.</hi> (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued he) is modest and decent; speaks ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally with respect of those he differs from, and with a due distrust of his own Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions: Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> is Positive and Pert; has
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:98199:17"/>
no regard for what other men have thought or said, and no suspicions that he is fallible. Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s Book has a Vein of Learning run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning through it, where there is no ostenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it: Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s Appendix has all the Pomp and Show of Learning, without the Reality. In truth (said he) there is scarce any thing, as the Book now stands, in which that and the Appendix agree, but in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending and admiring Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>; in which they are so very much of a Piece, that one would think Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> had writ both the one and the other.</p>
            <p>But leaving these two Friends to the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of their mutual Civilities, I shall go on to the rest of my remarks on Dr. <hi>Bent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>'s Introduction. After telling us then at whose Instance he wrote this famous Piece of Criticism, he begins to give us a cast of his skill in the Point. Sir <hi>W. Temple</hi> had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd in favour of the Ancients; that <hi>some of the Oldest Books we have are the best in their kinds.</hi> To this Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> replies, <hi>That some of the Oldest Books are the best in their kinds, the same Person having the Double Glory of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention and Perfection, is a thing observ'd even by some of the Ancients</hi> And for this he very learnedly quotes <hi>Dion Chrysostome: But then</hi> (says he) <hi>the Authors they gave this Honour to, are</hi> Homer <hi>and</hi> Archilochus, <hi>one the Father of Heroic Poem, and the other of Epode and Trochaic, p.</hi> 7. What he means by saying that this had been observ'd <hi>even</hi> by some of the Ancients, is not easie to apprehend, nor why he quotes <hi>Chrysostome</hi> for it, whose Authority either in this, or any other case, is
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98199:18"/>
not very considerable; and who besides, does not say that for which he's produc'd; especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when there is an approved Writer more ancient than <hi>Dion,</hi> that has directly said that for which <hi>Dion</hi> is improperly brought. <hi>Dion,</hi> in the Oration quoted, after a tedious insipid Exordium about the different talents of prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and dispraising, takes occasion from thence to mention <hi>Homer</hi> as the famous Parent of <hi>Panegyrick,</hi> as <hi>Archilochus</hi> was of <hi>Satyr,</hi> and prefers 'em to all others in their way. But he has not a word there about <hi>the Oldest Books being the best in their kind,</hi> or <hi>of the Double Glory of inventing and perfecting</hi>; for which Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> gravely produces him. But tho' <hi>Dion</hi> says nothing of this, <hi>Velleius Paterculus</hi> does: <hi>Non quenquam alium</hi> (says he) <hi>cujus operis primus Auctor fuerit, in eo perfectissimum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periemus praeter Homerum &amp; Archilochum. Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 5. 'Tis a little odd, methinks, that Dr. <hi>Bentley,</hi> who professes in this Piece of his to give Battel to Sophists and Sophistry, and to decry 'em as a company of illiterate Scrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, should yet think fit to grace the very Entrance of his Work, with vouchng the Authority of as errant a Sophist and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimer as ever was; and with vouching him for what he really did not say: and for what had been said by a much better hand, before him. But great Scholars have very particular ways with 'em.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> goes on: <hi>But the choice of</hi> Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laris <hi>and</hi> Aesop, <hi>as they are now extant, for the two great and inimitable Originals, is a piece of Criticism of a Peculiar Complexion, and must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98199:18"/>

            </p>
            <p>For <hi>Aesop</hi> it will be time enough to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count when I come to the entire Disserta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that concerns him. But as to <hi>Phalaris</hi>'s <hi>Epistles,</hi> many learned men of different Ages and Countries, have been profess'd admirers of 'em; never any man, till the Judicious Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> arose, pretended to despise 'em: even those Criticks of late days, who suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted their being Genuine, yet allow'd 'em to be finish'd things in their way, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently well counterfeited. And therefore the value which Sir <hi>W. Temple</hi> professes for 'em cannot be said to proceed from a <hi>Singulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Palate and Iudgment:</hi> at least this ought not to be said by him, who but four Pages afterwards lets us know, that <hi>Stobaeus</hi> esteem'd 'em so highly, as to insert some of 'em into his Judicious Collections; and that <hi>Suidas</hi> terms 'em <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>most admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Letters.</hi> Sir <hi>W. Temple,</hi> one would have thought, might have been secured from the imputation of Singularity by the concurring Judgments of two such men, for whom, we may be sure, Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> on any other occasion would have had a particular regard: the one an eminent Commonplacer, and the other a no less eminent Dictionary-writer. 'Tis a pleasant Reflexion to consider that Dr. <hi>Bent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> at the same time that he is passing this free Censure on Sir <hi>W. Temple</hi>'s Palate, is himself advancing an Opinion contrary to the sense of all Mankind that had ever written before him: Will not a modest Reader, on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98199:19"/>
be apt to say, that both the <hi>Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cism</hi> and the <hi>Critic</hi> too are of a <hi>Peculiar Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion</hi>?</p>
            <p>He forgets, I believe, when and where a certain Critic of our times maintain'd, that <hi>Ovid</hi> and <hi>Manilius,</hi> were the only two Poets that had <hi>wit</hi> among the Ancients. A very extraordinary piece of Criticism! and which, doubtless, proceeded not from any <hi>singularity of Palate and Iudgment!</hi> 'Tis just as if I should say, that Sir <hi>W. Temple</hi> and Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> are the two best-bred Writers living; or, to put it into the Dr's more learned and polite way, That <hi>Nireus</hi> and <hi>Thersites</hi> were the only two <hi>formose men that repair'd to the Siege of</hi> Ilium. <hi>Manilius</hi> writes with just as much <hi>wit</hi> as Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> does with <hi>modesty:</hi> only the difference is, that <hi>Manilius</hi>'s subject would not admit of <hi>wit</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore he might have it, for ought we know, tho' he did not show it: whereas Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s subject, (which is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally <hi>Himself</hi>) does not only admit of <hi>modesly,</hi> but require it.</p>
            <p>The rest of Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s Preamble is taken up in giving us an account how spurious Books came to prevail upon the World. He says, <hi>This was a practice almost as old as Letters; but that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> chiefly prevail'd, when the Kings of</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamus <hi>and</hi> Alexandria <hi>rivalling one another in the Magnificence and Copiousness of their Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, gave great Rates for any Treatises that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the names of Celebrated Authors</hi>; and this he proves out of <hi>Galen</hi> upon <hi>Hippocrates, de Naturâ Hominis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:98199:19"/>There are other Old Writers that tell this Story, and tell it more truly, than <hi>Galen</hi> did, tho' a Native of <hi>Pergamus.</hi> He positively af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, in favour of the Point he is proving, that till the time of these Rival Princes, there was no such thing as a spurious Book in the World; which is neither true, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to what Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> tells us in the case, that <hi>the Practice of forging Books was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most as Old as Letters.</hi> Here therefore, as before in the case of <hi>Paterculus,</hi> Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> should have contented himself with vouching apposite, tho' common Authorities; and not have gone out of his way to have fetch'd in a witness, that, after all, speaks against him. But he loves to surprize and dazle his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: for who would expect to see a point of History setl'd out of a Physician?</p>
            <p>I thought indeed Quotation had been the Dr's peculiar Province; and that either he could manage that to advantage, or nothing. But these two awkward Proofs out of <hi>Dion Chrysostome</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> (the very first he has produc'd) have shook my opinion of him even in this Respect. As we go further, we shall see clearlier what to judge of him.</p>
            <p>I will detain the Reader no longer in the Approaches to our Argument, than till I have desir'd him to joyn with me in his thanks to Dr. <hi>Bentley,</hi> for the Intimation he has given us of a certain Supplement to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronius</hi> found at <hi>Buda.</hi> He does not, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, mean that from <hi>Alba Graeca,</hi> which any of his Dictionaries would have told him was Latin, not for <hi>Buda,</hi> but <hi>Belgrade:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:98199:20"/>
I conclude, that this must be some new discovery, which Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> has had earlier notice of, than the rest of the Learned World; and that in time he will oblige us with a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther account of it.</p>
            <p>DR. <hi>Bentley</hi> having declar'd open War against <hi>Phalaris,</hi> and all his Party, and having in his own Opinion gain'd the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, thought that the more Captive Criticks there were to follow his Chariot-wheels, the more glorious would his Triumph be: He begins therefore with giving us an account of the Number and Strength of the Enemy he engages. He tells us, that the Epistles have been admitted as Genuine, ever since <hi>Stobaeus</hi>'s time; that He has quoted 'em thrice: that <hi>Suidas</hi> speaks of 'em with honour; and, that <hi>Tzetzes</hi> has made large Extracts out of 'em. <hi>These three, I think,</hi> says he, <hi>are the only Men among the Ancients that make any mention of 'em.</hi>

            <p>They are perhaps the <hi>only Ancients,</hi> whose testimonies are to be met with, in any of the Prefaces to <hi>Phalaris:</hi> but Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> methinks should have dug deeper for his materials, and consulted Original Authors.

The Latest of these is some Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies older than either <hi>Suidas</hi> or <hi>Tzetzes.</hi> Indeed <hi>Tzetzes,</hi> who liv'd but in the 12th Century, deserves not to be call'd an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi>; and Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> himself is of this mind in another part of his Dissertation <note n="(f)" place="margin">P. 53.</note>, where he stiles him <hi>a Later Greek.</hi> But it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, that he should be an Ancient here, and a Modern there, in order to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Ends which Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> had to serve by him.</p>
            <p>Besides these, there is another remarkable Quotation from the Epistles in <hi>Stobaeus,</hi> which Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> has overlook'd; 'tis <hi>Tit.</hi> CCXVIII: where an entire Epistle of <hi>Phalaris</hi> is tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd, as it is again in the Collection of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius</hi> and <hi>Maximus</hi> the Monks, which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies <hi>Stobaeus.</hi> Had Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> had these Authorities in his view, he might with bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Grounds, tho' not with more Assurance, have pronounc'd, that <note n="*" place="margin">P. 12.</note> The Epistles <hi>have the general Warrant and Certificate for this last thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand years, before the Restoration of Learning.</hi> And thus far I can agree with him: but when he further assures us, that <note n="†" place="margin">P. 11, &amp; 12.</note>

And now what would a Modest man expect shou'd have been Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s end in reckoning up all these great Mens Opinions, but to strengthen and countenance his Own? whereas he brings 'em in, only to shew how impossible it was for them to judge right, who had the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune to live before him. In spite of what the Learned men of so many Ages and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have thought and said, Dr. <hi>Bentley knows</hi> 
               <note n="(a)" place="margin">P. 64.</note>, and will <hi>demonstrate</hi> 
               <note n="(b)" place="margin">P. 5.</note>, <hi>Phalaris</hi>'s Epistles <hi>to be spurious:</hi> Nay, <hi>he is very much mistaken,</hi> he says, <hi>in the nature and force of his Proofs, if ever any man hereafter, that reads 'em, persist in his Old Opinion of making</hi> Phalaris <hi>an Author</hi> 
               <note n="(c)" place="margin">P. 13.</note>. I will own to the Reader, that had these words offer'd themselves to me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I had been acquainted with Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s Manner, they would have given me some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easiness. <hi>Phalaris</hi> was always a Favourite-book with me; from the moment I knew it, I wish'd it might prove an Original: I had now and then indeed some suspicions that 'twas not Genuine; but I lov'd him so much
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98199:21"/>
more than I suspected him, that I wou'd not suffer my self to dwell long upon 'em. To be sincere, The Opinion, or Mistake if you will, was so pleasing, that I was somewhat afraid of being undeceiv'd. However, I ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd to try, whether the Dr's Proofs would overbear me with that weight of Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they threatned. I read 'em, I weigh'd 'em; and I found, to my satisfaction, that <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laris</hi> might still be an Author, notwithstanding what Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> had said against him. Nay, I assure the Reader, that my Doubts about the Authority of the Epistles, since I read Dr. <hi>Bent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>'s Dissertation, are much lessen'd; and if he should write once more upon the Subject, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the point would be clear to me.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Arguments</hi> against the Epistles (they are to go for such, till I have prov'd 'em not to be Arguments) when taken out of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion with which he has deliver'd 'em, may be distinguish'd into such, as affect the <hi>whole,</hi> or touch only those <hi>Particular Epistles</hi> from whence they are drawn. The first of these are of greatest consequence; for if any One of 'em holds, the Authority of the Epistles is in danger: and I shall therefore, with Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s leave, consider 'em in the first place. In order to come at any of these, I must over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look a great many of his Pages for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; not without intentions of returning to 'em: for he has advanc'd nothing on this Subject, but what shall, in its proper Time and Place, have a thorough Examination.</p>
            <p>The First of these <hi>General Proofs,</hi> that I meet with, (for I shall take 'em as they lye) is in the 12th Paragraph, where the Dr. objects
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:98199:22"/>
against the <hi>Dialect Phalaris</hi> uses; who reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Sicily,</hi> and being, as he tells us <note n="(a)" place="margin">P. 44.</note>, born there, should have spoken <hi>Doric,</hi> the prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Language of the Island; whereas he writes <hi>Attic, the beloved Dialect of the Sophists, in which they affected to excell one another even to Pedantry and Solaecism</hi> 
               <note n="(b)" place="margin">P. 41.</note>.</p>
            <p>Tho' it be no very material point, yet I cannot grant the Dr. that the Language of these Letters is properly Attic. There are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed several Attic ways of speech in 'em; but so there are in other Authors, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessedly wrote in the Common Dialect. 'Tis one thing to mix Atticisms in ones style, and another thing strictly to write Attic; <hi>Homer</hi> did the one, <hi>Thucydides</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> the other: however no body will say, that <hi>Homer</hi> wrote in the same Dialect with <hi>Thucydides</hi> and <hi>Plato.</hi> Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> has abundance of pure <hi>Anglicisms</hi> in his Latin, and <hi>Latinisms</hi> in his English; but he will not for all that be willing to allow, either that his Dissertation on <hi>Malala</hi> is in English, or that this on <hi>Phalaris</hi> is in Latin.</p>
            <p>Well, but supposing the Letters to be in Attic, what use does he make of this? why, he argues from hence, that they were written by the Sophists; <hi>who,</hi> he tells us, <hi>affected to excell one another in writing Attic, even to Pedan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantry and Solaecism</hi> 
               <note n="(c)" place="margin">P. 41.</note>. A very deep Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction! so deep, that I must confess my self to be a little at a loss for the Meaning of it. The perusal of a Late Author indeed has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me a clear Notion what it is to be <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected even to Pedantry,</hi> but the being affected <hi>even to Solaecism,</hi> and in <hi>Attic</hi> too, is to Me, I confess, a very incomprehensible degree of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98199:22"/>
Affectation. I thought, the <hi>Athenians,</hi> of all the <hi>Greeks,</hi> spoke the most Properly, and Purely; and were the furthest remov'd from any suspicion of <hi>Solaecism:</hi> and that therefore no one could be guilty of it, <hi>while</hi> he spake as They spake; any more than a Man can stick strictly to the Language of the Court, and yet speak false English. But Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s Notions of Language differ much from mine; and therefore 'tis no wonder if I do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend him.</p>
            <p>To let his <hi>Flourish</hi> pass then, and to come to his <hi>Argument</hi>; I will venture to say, that it is <hi>a silly one:</hi> and I make thus free with it, because it is <hi>my Own,</hi> and mention'd by Me, in my Preface to <hi>Phalaris</hi>

            <p>For <hi>Phalaris</hi> was by no means oblig'd to speak <hi>Doric,</hi> on the account of his being <hi>a Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilian born</hi>; for two good Reasons: because the Natives of <hi>Sicily</hi> (and so of other places) did not always write in the prevailing Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of their Country; and because <hi>Phalaris</hi> was no Native of <hi>Sicily.</hi> I shall dispatch this Last point first, because it will give us the least Trouble.</p>
            <p>If the Credit of the Letters stands good, <hi>Phalaris,</hi> we are sure, was no <hi>Sicilian</hi>; Dr. <hi>Bently</hi> indeed says he was, and threatens to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:98199:23"/>
prove it from Good Authors<note n="†" place="margin">P. 44.</note>: but threatn'd History, as well as other threatn'd things, has the luck sometimes to live long; and so it has happen'd in the present point: for the Dr. notwithstanding his Menaces, has not, throughout his Dissertation, said a Syllable to shake it.</p>
            <p>I can help the Dr. indeed to One Author, that speaks something to his purpose; and Him an Old Scholiast too, which will please the Dr. the better: <hi>Nonnus</hi> 
               <note n="(a)" place="margin">In <hi>Greg.

This is all I can at present do for the Dr. in the matter; and as little as it is, it is more than the Dr. has done for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>

And upon this fancied mistake of mine he is very merry, and throws out a great deal of awkward Drollery; which, had there been an Occasion given for it, would, let me tell him, have but ill become a Man of his Gravity, and a Reader of Old Scholiasts: but as it is founded purely on a Mistake of his own, is somewhat the more unseasonable, and unbecoming. For, after the Dr's fit of Mirth is over, I would ask him seriously, how he comes to impute the Discovery of this new City in <hi>Crete</hi> to me? do not the Epistles
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98199:23"/>
themselves plainly suppose it? and does not he himself grow wise enough, or sincere enough, by the 58th Page, expresly to own that they do so; and save me the trouble of proving it?

It is enough for my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that the Letters have mention'd this <hi>Astypalaea.</hi> If Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> will discard all Places, that occurr but once in Ancient Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, he'l make mad Work in Geography. What does he think of <hi>Trinacia,</hi> the <hi>Sicilian</hi> Town in <hi>Diodorus?</hi> what of the <gap reason="foreign">

And, therefore to shorten the Work, and save my self, and the Reader, the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of more Instances, I'll put the Dr. in mind of what the Learned <hi>Palmerius</hi> says up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this place in <hi>Scylax: Ejus Loci seu Regiun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culae</hi> (says he) <hi>alibi quod sciàm non fit mentio.

                  </expan> devenerunt, vel semel, vel nunquam fecerunt mentionem?</hi> Does the Dr. think, because <hi>Astypalaea</hi> was an <hi>Island</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Cyclades,</hi> and among the <hi>Sporades,</hi> that therefore it could not be a <hi>Town</hi> any where else? Is not this just the Case of <hi>Naxos,</hi> which was an Isle among the <hi>Cyclades</hi>; and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:98199:24"/>
yet a Town in <hi>Crete,</hi> and in <hi>Sicily</hi> too? <hi>Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo</hi> mentions <hi>Astypalaea</hi> a Promontory in <hi>Attica,</hi> another Promontory of that name in <hi>Caria</hi>; a third <hi>Astypalaea,</hi> the ancient Metropolis of the Island <hi>Cos:</hi> and why might there not be an <hi>Astypalaea</hi> in <hi>Crete</hi> too?</p>
            <p>I have dwelt too long on this point; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I cannot yet part with it, till I have done right to the Learned <hi>Greek Professor of Cambridge</hi>; whom Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> takes upon him to correct, without the least Ground or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Reason: to shew, I suppose, that he was Impartial, and resolv'd to bestow his Good Manners, as he had done Himself, upon Both Universities.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Barnes</hi> would have the Island <hi>Astypalaea,</hi> where he supposes <hi>Phalaris</hi> born, to be that among the <hi>Cyclades.</hi> Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> allowing <hi>Phalaris</hi> to have been born in the Island <hi>Asty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palaea,</hi> yet says it must be that among the <hi>Spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades</hi>; for this convincing Reason; <hi>because this Latter was nearest to</hi> Crete, <hi>whither</hi> Phala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris<hi>'s Wife and Son are suppos'd to have fled.</hi> Ep. LXIX <note n="*" place="margin">P. 44.</note>. Giving the Dr. Leave to suppose this <hi>Flight</hi> from <hi>Astypalaea</hi> to <hi>Crete,</hi> why must it needs be from the <hi>Astypalaea</hi> that was near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est? Those that fly are usually glad to get as far as they can out of the reach of their Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suers. But now even the Flight, upon the Supposition of which this fine Reasoning turns, is it self a Fiction. For neither in that Epistle which the Dr. quotes for this, nor in any other Epistle, is any such Flight mention'd, or suppos'd, or in the least intimated. Was it worth his while to forge this little Piece of History, only in order to contradict his Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters?
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:98199:25"/>
Is the Pleasure of inventing a Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, meerly to be rude with, an Equivalent to the Shame of being told on't?</p>
            <p>But he has found the Professor in another Mistake, as Material as This, and as well made out. Dr. <hi>Barnes</hi> had call'd the Island, <hi>Astypala,</hi> and not <hi>Astypalaea</hi>; and the Exact Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> therefore is so kind, as to inform him how it should be spelt. A little share of Good Nature would have made the Dr. su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect an Error of the Press in this case, if there had been any Error; and a little more Reading than he has, would have taught him, that there was no Error in it: for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor call'd the Island but as <hi>Scylax</hi>

                  </gap>.</note> had call'd it before him. On both these accounts, the Dr. might have spar'd his Criticism: and so he would probably, but that Mr. Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor had been guilty of a Fault not to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given by <hi>Gratuitously undertaking to Apologize for the Epistles of</hi> Phalaris <note n="(b)" place="margin">Differ. <hi>p.</hi> 14.</note>, in his Elaborate Edition of <hi>Euripides:</hi> that is, (for I can make no other sense of it) by defending the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Epistles, <hi>without having any thing for his Pains.</hi> This looks as if the Dr. thought Learned Men were to set a Price upon their Civilities, and never part with a Favour till they had their Fee.</p>
            <p>But to return from our Digression; Let us allow the Dr. what he contends for, without any manner of Proof or Reason, that <hi>Phala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> was a <hi>Sicilian born:</hi> will he inferr from hence, that it was necessary for him to write in <hi>Doric?</hi> That I can never allow him. For we have Instances without Number, of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors writing in a Dialect different from that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:98199:25"/>
of their own Country; and not a few Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Sicilian</hi> Writers, who laid aside the <hi>Doric:</hi> and why then should <hi>Phalaris,</hi> a Prince, and a very Arbitrary and Lawless one, be confin'd to it? <hi>Agathyrsides,</hi> the Historian of <hi>Samos,</hi> had he follow'd the Dialect of his Country, would have written in <hi>Doric</hi>; and <hi>Chrysermus</hi> of <hi>Corinth,</hi> in <hi>Doric:</hi> and yet both of 'em writ in the Common Dialect, as appears by the Extracts out of 'em, preserv'd in <hi>Stobaeus.</hi> So did <hi>Andronicus</hi> the <hi>Rhodian,</hi> who paraphras'd some part of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and <hi>Dionysius</hi> the <hi>Halicarnassian</hi>; tho' both <hi>Rhodes</hi> and <hi>Halicarnass</hi> were Cities of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Original. <hi>Herodotus</hi> was of the same place with <hi>Dionysius,</hi> and yet made the <hi>Ionic</hi> Dialect his choice; as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> of <hi>Cos,</hi> a <hi>Dorian</hi> Town also, had done before him. <hi>Rhianus,</hi> and <hi>Epimenides</hi> were both <hi>Cretans:</hi> that the First of these wrote not in the particular Dialect of <hi>Crete,</hi> we are as sure, as that the large Fragment ascrib'd to him is his; that the Latter did not, we have reason to think from the short Citation out of him in St. <hi>Paul</hi>

Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed pretends in some measure to account for this by saying, that the <hi>Lyric</hi> (or, as He loves to speak, the <hi>Melic</hi>) Poets chose the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:98199:26"/>
Doric Dialect for the sake of the Doric Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, which was fitted to That, and to the Nature of the Ode: but why then did not the rest of the Lyric Writers chuse it too? It would have become <hi>Anacreon</hi>'s Odes, every whit as well as <hi>Sappho</hi>'s; and <hi>Archilochus</hi>'s, as well as either: and yet both <hi>Anacreon</hi> and <hi>Archilochus</hi> wrote in Ionic. So that no sure Rule can be fix'd, or holding Reason given, for the Ancient Writers departing from the Idiom of their Country: Historians, Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists, Philosophers, and Poets of all sorts practis'd it at pleasure; chusing such a Dialect, as either pleas'd their Own Ear, or the Ears of those for whose sake they wrote, and whom they endeavour'd to please <note n="(a)" place="margin">This probably was the Case of <hi>Callimachus,</hi> in his Hymn upon the Baths of <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,</hi> compos'd by him in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric, to compliment the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians</hi> (or <hi>Argivans,</hi> as Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> new names 'em, <hi>p.</hi> 82): tho' the same reason will not hold for his Other Doric Hymn, dedicated to the honour of <hi>Ceres:</hi> nor can any reason be given for it, but what will equally prove, that he ought to have written the rest of his Hymns in Doric.</note>; or such, as they thought suited best with their Subject: and very often they took up with that Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, which was in Fashion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Polite Writers of the Age in which they liv'd.

               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:98199:26"/>
would have said it was <hi>demonstrable.</hi> But no man should be Dogmatical in Cases of this Nature, where several other Circumstances, beside the vast distance of Time, concurr to make the Subject obscure; where all is but a Lucky Guess, and He that is most Learned must, if he be fair, confess, that he has but a very dim and uncertain Light to see by.</p>
            <p>It will then be very hard upon our <hi>Sicilian</hi> Prince, to deny him a Liberty, which Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of all sorts, and of all other Countries and Times have taken: and it will be harder still, if we consider, that this is what has been done often even by <hi>Sicilians</hi> themselves. <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> and <hi>Empedocles</hi> are famous Instances of this kind; the One, in Prose; and the Other, in Verse: <hi>Archimedes</hi> the <hi>Syracusan</hi>'s Works do not all equally partake of the Doric Idiom; some have more, and some have less of it, as they were written sooner or later; and his Treatise of <hi>the Sphaere and Cylinder,</hi> the most remarkable part of his Works, least of all.</p>
            <p>To come yet closer to our point: We have a Letter writ by <hi>Dion</hi> of <hi>Syracuse</hi> to <hi>Dionysius</hi> Tyrant of that place, and part of another written by <hi>Dionysius</hi> himself; both preserv'd among the Epistles of <hi>Plato</hi>; where there is not the least Shadow of Doricism: but as well the Prince as the Philosopher have <hi>writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten their Epistles in such a Dialect, as if</hi> (to use Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s Gentlemanly Phrase) <hi>they had gone to School at</hi> Athens <note n="*" place="margin">Diss. <hi>p.</hi> 43.</note>.</p>
            <p>Nay some of the Princes and States of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily,</hi> and other Dorian Countries, have caus'd <hi>Coins</hi> to be struck, whose Inscriptions are not
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:98199:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in pure Doric. [Abundance of Instances of of this kind are to be met with in <hi>Goltzius, Paruta,</hi> and <hi>Harduin:</hi> I shall give the Reader a Tast of them in the Margin <note n="*" place="margin">

               </note>.</p>
            <p>But the most remarkable Instance of all is that of <hi>Zaleucus,</hi> King of the <hi>Locrians,</hi> a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric Colony; the Preface to whose Laws is preserv'd in <hi>Stobaeus,</hi> an exact and faithful Copier of Old Authors; and has plainly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Doric Dialect in it. <hi>Diodorus Siculus,</hi> who does not so strictly transcribe, but chuses rather to weave things into the Phrase and Body of his History, has the same Preface, with some Alterations; but none, that make it more Doric than it is in <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baeus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, upon a View of these Instances, (and others of this kind, which I could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce; but I spare the Reader) I might be-speak the Dr. in his own pert way of Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; <hi>Pray, how came Attic</hi> (or any other Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect but the Doric) <hi>to be the Court-Language at</hi> Syracuse? <hi>How came</hi> Zaleucus, <hi>and</hi> Dionysius <hi>the Tyrant, so to doat on the Dialect of a Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craty</hi>

            <p>Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> has endeavour'd to prevent me in some part of the Evidence that I have brought; and has excepted against such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances as those of <hi>Empedocles,</hi> and <hi>Diodorus, whose Case,</hi> he says, <hi>is widely remote from that of our Tyrant.

               <hi>Diodorus Siculus,</hi> he tells us, <hi>and the other Historians of Dorian Nations, had great reason to decline the Vse of their Vernacular Tongue, as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper for History; which besides the affectation of Eloquence, aims at Easiness and Perspicuity, and is design'd for General Vse: but the Doric is Course and Rustic, and always clouded with an Obscurity.</hi>

The Reader cannot but observe in this Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage the particular Beauty and Happiness of the Dr's Expression: but it matters not much how he Writes, let us consider how he Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
            <p>If the Dr's Solution be just, how came <hi>Archimedes</hi> and the <hi>Pythagorean Naturalists</hi> and <hi>Moralists</hi> not to <hi>decline the use of their Vernacular Tongue,</hi> as well as the <hi>Historians?</hi> They all, I dare say, aim'd as much at <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuity,</hi> and the Last of the Three doubtless design'd their Treatises as much for <hi>General Vse.</hi> I will not say indeed, that they <hi>affected Eloquence,</hi> because I do not think that a good Character, whatever Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> may: but, which is much better, they <hi>were</hi> Eloquent; very Lofty and Magnificent, and withal very Clear in their Expression: on both which accounts they are recommended by <hi>Dionysius Halicarnasseus</hi>

            <p>'Tis true, as the Doric Dialect grew out of Use and Request, their Writings grew less Easie and Perspicuous; and <hi>Porphyry</hi> had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son therefore to attribute the decay of the <hi>Pythagorean</hi> Sect to the Use, or rather to the Decay of that Dialect: but without dispute the Doric, in its flourishing days, had the same degree of Clearness as the rest; and the Philosophers, that writ in it, design'd their Works to be of as General Use, and to last
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:98199:29"/>
as long, as those of the Historians. So that Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> has assign'd no Reasons for the Historians not writing in Doric, but what will serve as well to prove Others not to have writ in it, tho' we are sure they did: a Way of arguing, worthy his Adventurous Pen! and which no body, I believe, will envy him the honour of!</p>
            <p>Hitherto I have been proving against Dr. <hi>Bentley,</hi> (I hope not without success) that <hi>Phalaris</hi> was under no obligation of writing Doric, tho' he had been <hi>a Sicilian born:</hi> much less was he oblig'd to write it, upon the account of his Living among the <hi>Agrigentines,</hi> or Reigning over them, as Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends. <hi>He was a Publican</hi> (says the Dr.) <hi>or Collector of Taxes; could not that Perpetual Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goce and Converse with the Dorians bring his Mouth to speak a little broader</hi> 
               <note n="(a)" place="margin">P. 46.</note>? No doubt it <hi>could</hi>; and perhaps it <hi>did:</hi> but the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, whether, notwithstanding his learning Doric, he might not retain another Dialect with it; and speak it, and write it occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally? But <hi>would not He that aim'd at Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, and for that reason design'd to be Popular, have quitted his Old Dialect for that of the place, and not by every word he spake make the Invidious Discovery of his being a Stranger</hi>? The Dr. forgets, that every one of <hi>Phalaris</hi>'s Epistles were written <hi>after</hi> he was a Tyrant: He might, for ought we know, speak Doric be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he got into Power; but afterwards there was no need of courting the People, for he govern'd by <hi>his Blew coats</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">P. 39.</note>. And I think he could not have taken a more proper way of shewing his Tyrannical Temper, than by
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:98199:30"/>
throwing off the Language of the Country, and using a Foreign Dialect in all his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatches. <hi>The Conqueror</hi> did the same thing by Us, when he chang'd the Language of our Law; and he shew'd himself in nothing more a Conqueror, than by doing it.</p>
            <p>But the Dr. has urg'd, that <hi>Phalaris,</hi> being such a Tyrant, would not probably have been <hi>fond of the Language of a Democracy, that was eminently <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, an hater of Tyrants</hi> 
               <note n="(a)" place="margin">P<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 41.</note>. Was not Doric too the Language of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedaemonians</hi>? and did not they hate Tyrants, as much as the <hi>Athenians</hi> themselves? At this rate, <hi>Phalaris</hi> could not have spoken any Dialect of the Greek Tongue, for every one of 'em was the Language of a Democraty, some where or other. If the Dr's Reasoning be right indeed, it may happen to prove that the Epistles are not Genuine, because not written in <hi>Persic</hi>; but it will never prove 'em Spurious, because they are not written in Doric. After all, what Trifles are these to amuse us with? that <hi>Phalaris,</hi> to be sure, would not speak Attic, because <hi>the</hi> Athenians <hi>in his time drove out</hi> Pisistratus? Would I give my self leave to declaim at this rate, might I not with much better colour say, that <hi>Phalaris</hi> would, to chuse, make use of that Dialect; because it was the Language of <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistratus,</hi> his Brother Tyrant? I see Dr. <hi>Bent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> loves no less to argue, than read out of the way; and it is so much out of the way, that I am asham'd to follow him.</p>
            <p>Were I so very a Critic, as to love Wran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling rather than Truth, I might further di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute it with the Dr. whether Doric were

the Language of <hi>Agrigent,</hi> or no, and that upon no less an Authority than <hi>Strabo</hi>'s; who expresly says, that <hi>Agrigent</hi> was a Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the <hi>Ionians</hi>

I wonder how this escap'd the most Learned and Acute <hi>Casau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon</hi>'s observation. Not to insist upon this therefore; but allowing Dr. <hi>Bentley,</hi> that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grigent</hi> was a <hi>Dorian</hi> Town, as I believe it was; allowing him, that <hi>Phalaris</hi> was even born there, if he pleases, or in any other Town in <hi>Sicily,</hi> that he shall pitch upon, as I believe he was not: an allowing further, that <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laris</hi> was oblig'd on this account to speak Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric as long as he liv'd, yet still I have One Question to ask the Dr.; How can he prove, that <hi>Phalaris</hi> did not write Doric? 'Tis true, the Epistles at present are not in that Dialect: but they might have been Originally in it;
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:98199:31"/>
and afterwards, upon the disuse of that Dialect, <hi>have been turn'd out of it into the Ordinary Language at the Fancy of some Copyer, before the Days of</hi> Stobaeus <note n="*" place="margin">P. 49.</note>. This the Dr. has irrefragably prov'd in the very Article we are upon, to have been the case of <hi>Ocellus Lucanus</hi>'s Book <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: and why may it not too have been the case of <hi>Phalaris</hi>'s Epistles? If some Copyer <hi>since Stobaeus</hi>'s <hi>time</hi> thought that <hi>Ocellus</hi>'s <hi>Physics</hi> would look better out of Doric than in it, and therefore transdialected 'em; why might not some other Copyer <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Stobaeus</hi>'s <hi>time</hi> think the same of our Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants Letters, and do the same to 'em? and why, after this was done, might not the Original <hi>Phalaris</hi> be lost, as well as the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal <hi>Ocellus?</hi> It is certain, that <hi>Stobaeus</hi> thought that this might so happen, or at least, that <hi>Phalaris</hi> might not have written Doric originally; for he transcribes several of his Epistles into his Excellent Work, in the very Language we now find 'em, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out imagining in the least that they could not be Genuine, because they were not in Doric. Such a Consequence as that never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd into his Head: He had met with seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Sicilian</hi> Writers, that chose to write out of the Dialect of their Country, particularly <hi>Empedocles,</hi> an Author of the same Town with <hi>Phalaris:</hi> (He had not indeed met with any <hi>Heroic Poem</hi> of his; that Lucky Hit was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd for the Inquisitive Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>) and he had met also with some Writers, whose works were at first in all probability penn'd in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric, and yet were in another Dialect in his time: for instance, the Pieces of <hi>Perictyone,</hi> and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:98199:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Aristoxenus,</hi> two <hi>Pythagoreans</hi>; and who very probably wrote Doric, because they were <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoreans</hi>; and yet in <hi>Stobaeus</hi>'s time it is plain, that some part of the Writings of the One were in Ionic, and those of the Other (if I remember right; for I have not <hi>Stobaeus</hi> now by me) in the Common Dialect. Let Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> then take which side he pleases; either that <hi>Perictyone,</hi> and <hi>Aristoxenus,</hi> (and I will add <hi>Zaleucus</hi> too, who we are sure was a <hi>Pythagorean</hi> also from very good Authority <note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s next Suggestion is this, <hi>We are assur'd that the other Pieces of this Author were made in Doric, as one of Law, <gap reason="foreign">

and makes the same Use of it: <hi>Ocellum scil. Lucanum scimus Librum de Legibus scripsisse — hujus fragmentum exhibet Stobaeus — Doricâ Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecto expressum,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> goes on, <hi>But, which is plain De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration, Four Citations are brought by the same Writer out of this very Book, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, all which are in Doric, and not as they are now extant in the Common Dialect. Vizzanius</hi> referrs us to these four very places as they lye in <hi>Stobaeus,</hi> and observes too that they are there in Doric; not, as they are now extant, in the Common Dialect. <hi>De caeteris tandem in hoc Ocelli Opusculo contentis quis dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet?

               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:98199:34"/>
and Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> upon this point, is, that <hi>Vizzanius</hi> does not triumph over the mistakes of those that went before him, nor tell us that All the Learned Men before his time had doubted whether the Work were Genuine; even when he might perhaps have said this safely, and truly: whereas Dr. <hi>Bently</hi> says it, fifty Years afterwards; and assures the World, that <hi>HITHERTO Learned Men have doubted</hi> of this matter, at the very time that he is a Translating a Learned Man, who was so far from doubting of it, that he was giving Reasons, why No body else should ever doubt of it hereafter.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> concludes his Whole Argument thus, <hi>Now We see by these Fragments, that every Word of the True Book is faithfully preserv'd; the Doric only being chang'd into the ordinary Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, at the Fancy of some Copyer, since the Days of</hi> Stobaeus. <hi>Vizzanius</hi> does not speak quite so strongly as the Dr, but he gives much the same account of it: <hi>Quis dubitet de hoc Opusculo, cùm viderit eosdem quos retulit Stobaeus textus iisdem quidem omninò verbis, at diversâ Dialecto, Doricâ scilicet conscriptos? — indéque tenui ac facili immutatione Ocelli Opera ad Atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam traducta Dialectum?</hi> and in the Words before quoted [<hi>Hinc certa potius,</hi> &amp;c.] He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers the Cavils of those who suspected <hi>Ocel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> from his Dialect, and handsomly turns their own Cavils against them. But I must give Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> his Due, and own he has here made some Improvement: for <hi>Vizzanius</hi> never thought of carrying this Argument so far as to prove, that because these few Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments cited by <hi>Stobaeus</hi> exactly agree with
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:98199:34"/>
               <hi>Ocellus,</hi> as we now have him, therefore <hi>'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that every Word of the True Book is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully preserv'd.</hi> This was a Consequence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd for Dr. <hi>Bentley,</hi> which a Common Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic, who reasons but like other men, would never have thought of: and it being the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one which he has produc'd of his Own on this Occasion, I should not be just to him, unless I fairly told the World, that he <hi>did not borrow it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, why don't the Critics, Great and Small, rise up to do him Homage? How many <hi>Letters can he produce from Learned Men abroad,</hi> who have paid him their acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for this Information? What has he to say for himself? can he pretend not to have seen this Edition of <hi>Ocellus</hi>? how came he then to hit just upon all <hi>Vizzanius</hi> says, and no more? has he not seen the <hi>Amsterdam Edition</hi> of Dr. <hi>Gale</hi> neither? To what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, does he think, that Dr. <hi>Gale</hi> set those Four Passages out of <hi>Stobaeus</hi> before his Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but to let People see that his Author was Genuine, and writ in Doric? He did not indeed make a Stir with that matter in his Preface, because he knew that <hi>Vizzanius</hi> had exhausted the point before Him; and he thought it not fit for Him to take the humble and dishonourable Task of transcribing ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man's Labours, either with, or without naming him.</p>
            <p>I am glad of this Opportunity of mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Worthy <hi>Dean of York,</hi> and of paying my Publick Acknowledgments to him, for the particular Kindness and Favours I receiv'd from him, while I was under his Care. The
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:98199:35"/>
Foundation of all the little Knowledge I have in these matters was laid by Him; which I gratefully own: for I think my self oblig'd to let the World know, whom I have been beholden to; tho' Dr. <hi>Bentley,</hi> I find, be of another Opinion.</p>
            <p>And now I think I may without Vanity say, that I have outdone Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> in the way of <hi>Discovery:</hi> for Mine, as inconsiderable as it is, is a Discovery; and such an one, as proves His to be None.</p>
            <p>FROM the particular <hi>Idiom</hi> of Speech which <hi>Phalaris</hi> us'd, Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> has <hi>prov'd</hi> nothing but this, that he can Construe a Latin Preface, take a Learned Man's Notions, and calmly put 'em off for his own; and then imperiously summon in the Men of Letters to do Obeysance to Him, as the First Discoverer: all which I, and his Readers, would readily have allow'd him, without putting him to the trouble of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it. Having therefore thus strenuously manag'd the Argument of <hi>the Dialect,</hi> he now turns his Formidable Pen to another kind of Proof: He has found out, that the <hi>Greek</hi> even of that Dialect is more <hi>Modern</hi> than the Times of <hi>Phalaris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Arguments on this Head are so far from making any thing to his purpose, that one would imagine he brought 'em only as so many Instances to illustrate what he said in the 13th Page, that Men <hi>have been deceiv'd in their Conjectures of this Nature even to Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule.</hi> For, could he make out what he aims at, and produce some Expressions from these
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:98199:35"/>
Epistles, that are not us'd by the Polite Greek Writers, what would he inferr from hence? that these Words were certainly coin'd since the Age of <hi>Phalaris</hi>? how does he know but that they might be Then in use, and drop'd afterwards when the Learned Age came on; and reviv'd again, as that declin'd? <hi>Horace</hi> thought such Changes and Revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Speech not unusual: and it might easily be prov'd, that there have been many such, both in the Greek and Latin Tongue; but that Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> has made the Proof of it superfluous here: for he has not produc'd any One Word, that is of that New Stamp he pretends. And among all the <hi>Marks and Moles</hi>

            <p>He has so propos'd his First Instance, that He and I shall have no Dispute about it in This Place: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in the sense of <hi>accusing,</hi> is, he says, <hi>an Innovation in Language, for which the Ancients us'd</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. I entirely agree with him, 'tis an Innovation in Language, and a very Modern one; so Modern, that I suspect 'twas first broach'd by <hi>a Little Greek,</hi> that writ towards the latter end of the 17th Century: (whom I shall not forget to talk with on this score, when I find his Criticism in its Proper Place, among the <hi>Faults of the Version</hi>) and consequently I apprehend the Epistles to be in no danger from This Word; but the next seems to carry Terror in it.

Let it have its force to the Confusion of <hi>Phalaris,</hi> and all his Adherents: but what shall we do for St. <hi>Paul</hi>? He comes far within this Period; so that the Writings that carry his Name must be Four hundred Years Younger than We Christians suppose 'em: and the Epistle to the <hi>Romans</hi> could not be the Genuine Work of that <hi>Apostle,</hi> but was penn'd (as <hi>Phalaris</hi>'s Epistles were) by some <hi>more Recent Sophist</hi>; whom Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> has <hi>detected and unmask'd</hi> by the word <gap reason="foreign">

VIII.) <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; which, if the Word had then born as Vile a sense as it did afterwards, he would certainly have done: for he had a little of Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> in him at that time, and was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing the very Worst Names he could think of upon his Adversaries.

            <p>Till I am at leisure to look out for more Authorities, I hope <hi>Plato</hi> may be thought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable enough to countenance <hi>Phalaris</hi> in the use of this Expression: but the Dr. has still a Proof in reserve, which he takes to be the most distinguishing Mark of a Late Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <gap reason="foreign">

               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: that is, (if I can make any Sense of what he says) this Use of the Word is so mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern, that even <hi>Tzetzes</hi> himself was asham'd so to employ it, and therefore put <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> instead of it. But if <hi>Tzetzes</hi>'s Judgment may go for any thing, he's of my side; for he cites the Epistles as Genuine: and therefore to be sure did not substitute <gap reason="foreign">

room of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, because he thought this sense of the word Modern. And here again I must put the Dr. in mind of his Bible. For in the LXX. we find, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, (<hi>Prov.</hi> xxxi.29.) where <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> must mean <hi>Women,</hi> or <hi>Maidens:</hi> But these Maidens were <hi>Some body's Daughters</hi>; and so, I suppose, were those that <hi>Phalaris</hi> presented to his Friend. The same Expression recurrs too in the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists, where they tell us what our Saviour said to the Woman that touch'd the Hem of his Garment; St. <hi>Matthew</hi> has it, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; and St. <hi>Mark,</hi>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> I need not go farther for Instances, since 'tis probable that this Criticism is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther founded on a mistake; and what we now read <gap reason="foreign">

If our great Dealer in MSS. did not observe this, where is his Sagacity? If he observ'd it, without owning it, where is his Sincerity? He must give me leave now and then to ask him an Insulting Question; He has ask'd me a great many. But I have One Enquiry more to make of him on this occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and that is, Whether he thinks, that his <hi>Philosophical Lectures</hi> serve more to the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment of Religion, than his <hi>Criticisms</hi> do to overthrow it? For is he not Positive, that the Idioms of the Letters prove them to be
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:98199:39"/>
               <hi>a Thousand Years later than</hi> Phalaris? And are not some of these very Idioms frequently to be met with both in the <hi>Gospels</hi> and <hi>Epistles?</hi> Should not so Profound a Grecian and Divine as He is have look'd a little into the New Testament, before he had pronounc'd such rash and groundless Assertions? Could Men imagine One, who writes at this rate, to have any Meaning, they would think he had a very ill one: but the whole management of this Controversie clears him from all suspicions of Meaning and Design.</p>
            <p>These are all the <hi>Marks of Novity,</hi> which he has given himself the trouble to take notice of; <hi>They that will search,</hi> he says, <hi>may find more of this sort:</hi> without question they may; but if they don't find some of <hi>another sort,</hi> they'll have the Discretion to keep their Discoveries to themselves, and not expose 'em to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by every one that can turn an <hi>Index,</hi> or a <hi>Lexicon</hi>

By such Helps as these, 'twould be easie to collect Authorities in abundance against every In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance that Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> has brought on this head: but I am so far from valuing my self upon a multitude of Quotations, that I wish there had been no occasion for those few I have produc'd; and think I am oblig'd to excuse my self to the Reader for that mixture of Latin and Greek, with which I am forc'd to vary this Odd Work of mine. I can only say, that I have been as sparing in this way, as Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> would give me leave to be: and I have the rather avoided being tedious upon the Particular Point in debate between

us, that I might have room to examine the General Reflection which he has made upon the Change and Decay of Languages.</p>
            <p>It is easie (says the Dr.) <hi>from the very turn and fashion of the Style to distinguish a fresh En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Composition from another a hundred Years old. Now there are as real and sensible Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the</hi> Greek; <hi>were there as many that could discern them. But very few are so vers'd and practis'd in that Language, as ever to arrive at that Subtilty of Tast</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Diss. <hi>p.</hi> 52</note>. I can easily grant, that the <hi>English</hi> Tongue has undergone very consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable and surprizing Changes, especially in this Last Century; till about the middle of which, we did not in good earnest set about the Cultivating and Refining it: and then carried our Improvements so far, that Some who wrote at the beginning of this Century are not now easily understood. At our best, We are perhaps a little too fond of adopting Foreign Words; and fancying, out of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty peculiar to our Nation, that we have not stock enough of our own, are continually borrowing from our Neighbours: and this brings a great many New Phrases in upon us, and consequently antiquates a great many others. Besides we have few things in our Tongue writ with any tolerable Degree of perfection; and They therefore who would write or speak well, have no Patterns to look up to, no sure Rule, but the present Mode of the Age, to guide themselves by: and as fast as That alters therefore, the Manner of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting must alter along with it. But now if Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> pretends to point out as <hi>Real and Sensible Differences</hi> in the several Ages of the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:98199:40"/>
               <hi>Greek,</hi> as a moderate Critic may in the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,</hi> I'm afraid his <hi>Subtilty of Tast</hi> will fail him. Does he take the <hi>Greek</hi> of <hi>Lucian</hi> to be as different from that of <hi>Plato,</hi> as our <hi>English</hi> Now is from that which was spoken soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Conquest? Are not <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Oppian</hi> much nearer one another in their Language than <hi>Chaucer</hi> and <hi>Cowly,</hi> tho' in Time they are far more distant? No body is so absurd as to say, that the Greek Tongue did not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of some few Alterations in Every Age; but 'twas incomparably the most fix'd and enduring of any that we are generally acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with: and I shall offer at Some Reasons, that gave it this remarkable advantage over other Languages. 'Twas early improv'd and adorn'd by Men of the greatest Genius that ever appear'd in the World; They polish'd and perfected it to that degree, that it was admirably fitted to all the Purposes of Speech and Ways of Writing imaginable: They wrought it up into all the Majesty and Grace, all the Sweetness and Smoothness that an Happy Composition of Words, an Harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mixture of Vowels and Diphthongs, or a Just Cadency of Syllables could give it. The best Greek Writers had generally Skill in Music; which was infus'd into 'em from their Infancy, and none were reckon'd well-bred that wanted it. This made their Ear just, and fine: and the fineness of their Ear easily slid into their Tongue; model'd their Speech, and made it Tuneable. They brought all the Learning in the World into their Language; and wrote in the best manner, upon all the most useful and pleasing Subjects, that could
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:98199:40"/>
benefit, or entertain Mankind. The Natural Perfection of their Tongue, and the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing Excellency of their Authors in all Kinds of Knowledge, and Ways of Writing, made 'em a Compleat Standard and Model to other Nations, and after-Ages; upon which every one endeavour'd to form himself. So that what was sure always to be lik'd, could not chuse but last long. Their Empire also did not a little contribute to the Stability and Prevalence of their Language: They overcame a Great part of the World, and extended their Tongue with their Conquests, so as to make it Universal; All Nations bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd from Them, but They had that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the Barbarity of other Countries, that they were shy of suffering either their Manners, or their Speech to be introduc'd among 'em. This Pride they preserv'd in a great measure, even when the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was at its utmost heighth; and while <hi>Rome</hi> flourish'd with the Glory of Arms, the Seat of Learning still continu'd at <hi>Athens.</hi> This kept the Language so far entire and unmix'd, that we have <hi>Greek</hi> Books writ by Authors at almost Two thousand Years distance, who disagree less in their Phrase and Manner of Speech, than the Books of any Two <hi>English</hi> Writers do, who liv'd but Two hundred Years asunder. This then was a Peculiar Happiness of the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue; No other Language, that has been of known and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar use in the World, not even the <hi>Latin</hi> it self, enjoy'd any thing like it. An 150 or 200 Years was the utmost Length of Time that the Latin Purity continu'd. And therefore,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:98199:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to <hi>Compare</hi> the <hi>Greek,</hi> the most Holding Tongue in the World, with the <hi>English,</hi> the most Fickle and Fleeting of any; and to <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr</hi> from the observable difference between the several Ages of English, that there was <hi>as</hi> great a Difference between the several Ages of Greek; is a <hi>Comparison</hi> and an <hi>Inference,</hi> which No-body, but Dr. <hi>Bentley,</hi> would have allow'd himself to make: that is, (to be plain with him) No-body but One, who has no true Relish, no nice Tast of the Beauties and Proprieties of Either of these Languages; or of any Other, that he has yet pretended to judge of, or to write in. By those <hi>Marks and Moles of Novity</hi> which he has pointed out, in the Paragraph we are upon, the Reader is by this time satisfied, how able he is to assign to every Greek Writer his proper Age and Period, meerly by the <hi>Thread and Colour of his Style.</hi> Indeed, tho' he has the Vanity to declare this to be his Extraordinary Faculty, yet he has withal the Modesty <hi>not to hope that he shall convince any body</hi> 
               <note n="(a)" place="margin">Disser. <hi>p.</hi> 52.</note>; and in this, I dare say, he is not mistaken. For 'tis some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what hard to imagine, how a Man should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Spirit and Delicacy, and all the Various Niceties of a Dead Tongue, who is so far from having any exquisite sense of these things, even in that very Tongue, which he was born and bred up in. I shall take an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion by and bye to give the Reader such a Specimen of his English Eloquence, as will discourage any body (if there be any body left, who is not yet discourag'd) from chusing Him for a Taster. In the mean time, to stay the Reader's Longing, I shall instance in One
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:98199:41"/>
Happy Phrase, newly minted by the Dr. in this very Paragraph: he speaks here of the <hi>Mien of a Face</hi>; which, as I take it, is much the same thing with the <hi>Behaviour of a Look,</hi> or the <hi>Carriage of a Smile:</hi> I do not know how particular the Dr's <hi>Mien,</hi> or his <hi>Face,</hi> may be; for, to my knowledge, I never saw him; but the <hi>Mien of the Face</hi> of his Style the Reader must allow me, even from this single instance, is somewhat extraordinary!</p>
            <p>THE Use of the <hi>Attic Dialect</hi> was made one shrewd Objection against <hi>Phalaris</hi>; the Use of the <hi>Attic Talent,</hi> Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> is resolv'd, shall be another. This Way of Counting recurrs pretty often in the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles; however not so often, as that an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument built upon it should deserve to be rank'd among <hi>the General Proofs:</hi> but I am so little sensible of the force of it, that I am willing to allow it a place there; and if Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> can make it out, I promise to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, not those Particular Epistles only from whence 'tis taken, but the Whole Sett of them.</p>
            <p>The Dr. upon this Article, accuses his <hi>Mock-Phalaris</hi> of mistaking the <hi>Sicilian Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent:</hi> and this Mistake of his, he, with his usual Gaiety, calls <hi>a Slippery Way of telling Mony</hi>

               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:98199:42"/>
Talents, whereas he means nothing like it. <hi>Now</hi> (says the Dr.) <hi>if a Bargain were made in</hi> England, <hi>to pay so many</hi> Pounds, <hi>or</hi> Marks; <hi>and the Party should pretend at last, that he meant</hi> Scots Marks, <hi>or</hi> French Livres; <hi>few, I suppose, would care to have Dealings with him.

               <note n="*" place="margin">Dissert. <hi>p.</hi> 54.</note>. So far from being the Case, that the Case is just contrary! For if the <hi>

                  </gap>icilian</hi> Talents were so very Low, and <hi>Phalaris</hi> must be thought to intend them in his Promises, and yet paid <hi>Attic</hi> ones; Those he dealt with had certainly no reason to complain of him. Would a man think himself ill us'd in <hi>Scotland,</hi> who should have a General Promise made him of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Pounds,</hi> which he expected to be made good in the <hi>Pounds</hi> of the Country, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd 'em afterwards in good <hi>English Sterling?</hi> What could possibly give this Perverse Turn even to Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s Imagination? What Cloudy Author had he been conversing with, that could put him into this State of Perple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xity and Confusion? We have great hopes indeed that the Intricate Accounts of this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph should be clear'd up, by such an Head, in such Order! But, it may be, the Dr. did not intend this for a Remark that was to Edifie his Reader; but for a pure piece of harmless Diversion. Having therefore sport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himself a little, he resumes the Chair, and thus authoritatively dictates to us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We are to know, that in</hi> Sicily, <hi>as in most other Countries, the Name and Value of their Coins, and the way of reckoning by Summs, was peculiar. The Sum</hi> Talent, <hi>in the</hi> Sicilian <hi>Accompt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd no more in Specie than Three</hi> Attic <hi>Drachms,

Now in all these Epistles the very Circumstances assure us, that by the word</hi> Talent <hi>simply nam'd, the</hi> Attic <hi>Talent is understood. But should not our wise Sophist have known, that a</hi> Talent, <hi>in that Country where he had laid the Scene of his Letters, was quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing?

            <p>Now, in opposition to the Dr's Reasonings and Authorities about this matter of the <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents,</hi> I shall endeavour to shew, that what the Dr. says <hi>we are to know,</hi> we are still <hi>to know,</hi> after all the Information he has vouchsaf'd to give us: and that if we did <hi>know</hi> it, we could not from thence gather, that these Epistles are Spurious. For if there is Room to suspect that the Dr's Witnesses are corrupted, if their Testimony is inconsistent, if they tell us things demonstratively false, if the Dr. says more than his Witnesses do, if there be stronger Authority to counterbalance theirs; if, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting what they say, or what the Dr. makes 'em say, to be true, the Letters may be never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless Authentic: if these things can be

            <p>The Dr's Witnesses are <hi>Pollux,</hi> and <hi>Festus,</hi> whom I shall examine severally. <hi>Aristotle</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is call'd in for a Witness; but He not appearing in Person, we have his Testimony only at second hand: so that its force will wholly depend on the Authority of <hi>Pollux,</hi> the Relater.

A Treatise of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> but not under this Name, is cited by <hi>Pollux</hi> in this Chapter: but whether that part of this Chapter which concerns the Value of <hi>Talents</hi> be genuine, we have Room to doubt. <hi>Seberus,</hi> in his Notes on <hi>Pollux,</hi> tells us, that from <hi>Pag.</hi> 435, <hi>v.</hi> 32, of his Edition, to the End of the 6th Chapter (within which space all that is said to <hi>Talents</hi> lies) is wanting in One MS But allowing it to be genuine, what the Dr. says is plain from that place in <hi>Pollux,</hi> is so far from being plain from thence, that <hi>Pollux,</hi> must be chang'd and help'd out from other Authors, before he

               </gap> is rightly substituted, which we have no reason to grant: yet after all Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> has impos'd upon us in his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luation of the <hi>Sicilian Talent.</hi> For the Value of the more Ancient <hi>Sicilian</hi> Talent, which is equal to 24 <hi>Nummi</hi> or <hi>Sestertii,</hi> will be equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent not to <hi>Three,</hi> but to <hi>Six Roman Denares,</hi> or <hi>Attic Drachms</hi>; it being agreed on all hands, that each <hi>Sestertius</hi> is one fourth part of a <hi>Denare</hi> or <hi>Drachm:</hi> so that the Dr. has sunk the value of the <hi>Sicilian Talent</hi> (admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this Computation) half in half.

counted at this rate; because I always thought, that <hi>Aristotle</hi> had some little Skill in Mathematicks.

            <p>I beg the Reader's Patience, while I take a Review of what has been said in answer to the Dr's First Authority.

               </gap> in <hi>Pollux</hi> was a <hi>Roman</hi> Word. When these Supplements are admitted, they do not sink the Talent in dispute quite so low as the Dr. doth. <hi>Pollux,</hi> whose Authority we must depend upon for this Citation from <hi>Aristotle,</hi> cites things of this nature from him which, as they there stand, are demonstrably false. In his Division of the Talent, he breaks it into pieces, which, admitting the Dr's Rate of the Talent, are of no Value, and of no Use.</p>

think these Letters Genuine.

Or there might be a Low Value us'd by the Natives, and ancient Inhabitants of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and the Talent us'd by the <hi>Greek Colonies</hi> that plac'd themselves there, might be higher. Or if in <hi>Phalaris</hi>'s time there was a Silver Talent of this Low Value of use among the Greek Colonies, at <hi>Agrigent</hi> and elsewhere, yet the Reasons that may be offer'd for <hi>Phalaris</hi>'s using the <hi>Attic</hi> Dialect (to speak loosely) tho' a <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilian,</hi> will justifie his reckoning the Talents, as the <hi>Athenians</hi> did: Or if these Letters might by a Later hand be chang'd out of the <hi>Doric</hi> Dialect into the <hi>Attic,</hi> the same hand might make 'em speak <hi>Attic,</hi> in the valuation of the Monies.

            <p>PEDANTRY is a Word of a very various and mix'd meaning, and therefore hard to be Defin'd: but I will Describe it to the Dr. as well as I can, by pointing out some of the Chief <hi>Marks and Moles</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>The First and surest Mark of a <hi>Pedant</hi> is, to write without observing the receiv'd Rules of Civility, and Common Decency: and without distinguishing the Characters of Those he writes to, or against: For Pedan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in the Pen, is what Clownishness is in Conversation; it is <hi>Written Illbreeding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is <hi>Pedantry,</hi> to affect the use of an Hard Word, where there is an Easie one; or of a Greek or Latin Word, where there is an English one, that signifies the very same
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:98199:52"/>
thing. And these Two Meanings of the Word my Lord <hi>Roscommon</hi> seems to have hinted in those sine Verses of his; which are worth at least half a dozen Pages of Dr. <hi>Bent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>'s <hi>Scraps</hi> of <hi>Callimachus,</hi> Notes and all.

            <p>To depart from the Common Ways of Writing or Speaking, and such as have been us'd by the best Pens, on purpose to shew ones self more Exact and Knowing than the Rest of the World, is a Piece of Affectation, that favours of <hi>Pedantry.

and Modern Writers. Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd our Spelling, and will have it <hi>Tauromi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium,</hi> because <hi>Pliny,</hi> and <hi>Solinus,</hi> (and perhaps somebody else) have happen'd to call it so. And here I must beg the Reader's Excuse, if I go a little out of the Way, to do right to Sir <hi>William Temple,</hi> in a Case of the Like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> tells him, with great Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Speech, that <hi>He, of all men, ought not to have arraign'd the Modern Ignorance in Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, who puts</hi> Delphos <hi>for</hi> Delphi, <hi>every where in his Essays</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Reflect. upon anc. and mod. Learning, <hi>p.</hi> 59.</note>: A Capital Mistake, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be chastis'd by the Acute Pen of Mr. <hi>Wotton!</hi> But is he sure that putting <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phos</hi> for <hi>Delphi</hi> is an Offence against Grammar? I thought always, that what was according to Propriety, and the receiv'd Use of a Tongue, could not be against Grammar. It may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be against some General Rule of Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar: but so Wise a Man as Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> is, should have known, that Grammar has not only <hi>General Rules,</hi> but <hi>Particular Exceptions</hi> too; and that the Common Custom and Usage of a Tongue is capable of creating an Exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption at any time; and is as good a Rule as any in the Grammar. Now <hi>Delphos,</hi> for the Latin Word <hi>Delphi,</hi> is us'd by all the finest Writers of our Tongue, and best Judges of it: particularly, by Mr. <hi>Waller</hi> twice, in some of his Last Copies <note n="(a)" place="margin">P. 269, 263.</note>; which, tho' they are worse Poetry than the rest, yet are in Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recter English: by Mr. <hi>Dryden,</hi> four or five times, in his Life of <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi>

Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> might have said indeed, that <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phos,</hi> in the Singular Number, is not Good <hi>Latin,</hi> or Good <hi>Greek:</hi> but when he says, 'tis <hi>bad English,</hi> he only shews, that he does not converse with so Good Authors as he ought to do. This Digression might have been spar'd, but that Mr. <hi>Wotton,</hi> when he was purging his Book of some unbecoming Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages in a second Edition of it, thought fit still to retain this Grammatical Reflection there: perhaps in a third Edition, he'l take care that This too shall bear the rest Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> will forgive me this short Visit to his <hi>Friend,</hi> now I return to him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pedantry</hi> consists also in <hi>Low</hi> and <hi>Mean</hi> ways of Speech, which are a Vicious Affectation of what is Natural and Easie, as Hard Words are of Learning and Scholarship. And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> has not offended this way, by those Familiar Expressions of <hi>Mother Clito the Herbwoman,</hi> and <hi>Going to Pott,</hi> and <hi>setting Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses together,</hi> and <hi>Roasting the Old Woman,</hi> and by his apt Simile drawn from <hi>Bungling Tinkers mending old Kettles</hi>; any-body, but Pedants, can tell.</p>
            <p>An Itch of contradicting Great Men, or Establish'd Opinions upon very slight Grounds, is another Instance of <hi>Pedantry:</hi> and (not to mention any thing that relates to the Present Dispute) something of this kind there was, I'm afraid, in Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s brisk Censure of

            </p>
            <p>The Subject is fruitful; but I will confine my self to one Particular more of the <hi>Pedant</hi>'s Character; and that is, a Love of Quoting Books, or Passages not extant, or never seen by him; in order to amaze and confound his poor Reader, and make himself Terrible in the Way of Learning. <hi>As</hi> Aristotle <hi>says in his Lost Treatise of the</hi> Sicilian <hi>Government,</hi> says the Dr <note n="*" place="margin">Dissert. <hi>p.</hi> 55.</note>; tho' that Treatise be so far <hi>lost,</hi> that <hi>Aristotle</hi> did really never write it.

            <p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:98199:54"/>These are all the <hi>Marks and Moles of Pedan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> that I can now stay to point out to the Dr: if he be still at a loss to know what the Pedant's Character is, and where to apply it; I referr him to a Passage in <hi>Bruyere</hi> 
               <note n="(a)" place="margin">Les Caract. ou les Moeeurs de ce Siecle. Chap. des Ouvrages de'l' Esprit.</note>, where I think this matter is very succinctly and fully handl'd. <hi>There are,</hi> says he, <hi> in Learning, as in War, a sort of Inferiour and Subaltern Officers; Men, who seem made only for Registers and Magazines to store up the Productions of better Writers. Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors they are, Transcribers, Plagiaries; They never Think, themselves; they tell You only what Others have thought before them. They heap to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether Matter in abundance, without Choice or Distinction; and care not how Worthless it is, so there be but Enough on't. They Know nothing, but just as they learn it from their Books; and Learn nothing but what every-body else desires to be Ignorant of. They have a Vain, Dry, Insipid sort of Knowledge; that is Disagreeable, and Vse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less; can neither enliven Conversation, nor conduce to Business. We are sometimes surpriz'd at their Reading, but always tir'd with their Discourse, or their Writings. These are They, who among All the Little Men, and Some Great Ones, go for Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars; but among the Wise and Sensible part of Mankind, for</hi> Pedants.</p>
            <p>This Account of <hi>Pedantry</hi> has drawn me a little out of my Way; I shall now return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into it, and consider the Particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> has brought to justifie his General Assertion, that the <hi>Matter and Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of the Letters betrays 'em not to be Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:98199:55"/>The first is <hi>an Improbable and Absurd Story</hi>

            <p>His Last Objection happily arose from contemplating the Matter of One Single E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle, the Dr. will now compare the Epistles together, and confute One by another. There is an <hi>Inconsistency,</hi> he says, <hi>between the</hi> LI<hi rend="sup">st</hi>

what it is in another. Upon such an unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Supposition as this, how many <hi>Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistencies</hi> might be found in <hi>Tully</hi>'s Epistles? or even in Those of St. <hi>Paul?</hi> And yet, if this Supposition do not take place, there is no manner of <hi>Inconsistency</hi> between these Two Epistles of <hi>Phalaris.</hi> The Penetrating Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> seems to have had some Suspicions, that this Argument was of it self a little too weak to stand its Ground; and therefore has back'd it with a strong Reserve of Four Other Suppositions: and if All These hold good, he will still prove the Epistles Spuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. First he <hi>supposes,</hi> that <hi>Erythia</hi> was poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son'd by <hi>Python, not long after</hi> Phalaris<hi>'s Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment</hi>; because otherwise, he <hi>supposes,</hi> she <hi>could not want Opportunities to follow him:</hi> then he <hi>supposes,</hi> Erythia <hi>was poison'd in the Island</hi> Astypalaea, where he <hi>supposes,</hi> that <hi>her Poisoner dwelt.</hi> Here's more <hi>Postulatums</hi> than <hi>Euclid</hi> requir'd to build the Whole Body of his Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon; and yet He must be very kind to Dr. <hi>Bentley,</hi> that will grant him any One of them; since there is nothing either in the Epistles themselves, or in any Other History I have had the Luck to meet with, that can give 'em the least Countenance. At present therefore I take the same Liberty, to deny every one of these Suppositions, as He has to assume them: If hereafter he can prove them in another Language, 'twill then be time enough to shew, that they are <hi>Nothing to the Purpose.</hi>

            <p>In some Other Epistles, the Dr. has disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd a <hi>Scene of Putid and Sensless Formality</hi>

Indeed the Dr. has, for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Phalaris,</hi> represented that Town as exceeding <hi>Populous</hi>; for <hi>Diodorus,</hi> he says, counts 200000 Souls in <hi>Agrigent,</hi> and Others 800000 <note n="†" place="margin">Dissert. <hi>p.</hi> 58.</note>. <hi>Diodorus</hi> I grant, in the place cited, says, there were such Numbers in it, when the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> took it, <hi>Olymp.</hi> LXXXXIII. 3; when (as he tells us in the same place) it was in its most prosperous and flourishing Estate: but must there needs be as many Inhabitants in it, 150 Years before, in the Reign of <hi>Phalaris?</hi> As for his Other Witness <hi>Laertius,</hi> his 800000 are given up by

have spoil'd the Complement to <hi>Dionysius,</hi> who might like well enough to have the Parallel drawn between Him and <hi>Hiero,</hi> or <hi>Pericles.</hi> or <hi>Periander,</hi> or <hi>Croesus</hi>; but would not have thought it a Civility, I believe, to have been compar'd with <hi>Phalaris:</hi> whose Character, when taken at the best, and as drawn in these Epistles, is not so Amiable, as that any man should be pleas'd with resembling him; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially One, who could not but be conscious to himself, that he had made use of His Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, and had reason to expect His Fate. <hi>Plato</hi> was a Great Master of Decency; and he never shew'd it more than in this dextrous management, which I am not surpriz'd to find that our Library-keeper has no Relish of.</p>
            <p>His last Argument is from <hi>Pindar,</hi> who speaks of <hi>Phalaris</hi>'s Cruelty with Detestation. And what follows from thence? that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard of <hi>his Extraordinary Dearness with Stesichorus</hi>; for the <hi>sake</hi> of which, <hi>Pindar,</hi> had he known it, would certainly have <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born giving him so Vile a Character</hi> 
               <note n="(a)" place="margin">Disser. <hi>p.</hi> 61.</note>. This indeed is Demonstration, and not to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood! I will not Attempt to answer it; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I will put the Dr. in mind of One false Colour, that he has given to his Argument: for it does not appear from any Expression in this Ode, that <hi>Pindar</hi> is there <hi>exhorting</hi> Hiero <hi>to be kind to Poets and Men of Letters</hi> 
               <note n="(b)" place="margin">Ibid.</note>. There is not a Word of <hi>Poets and Men of Letters</hi> mention'd in the Verses themselves, whatever Guess the <hi>Scholiast</hi> (who perhaps knew as little of <hi>Pindar</hi>'s Intentions, as I or Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> do) may make at their Remote
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:98199:60"/>
Meaning. <hi>Pindar</hi> only praises <hi>Hiero</hi> for his <hi>Humanity</hi> and <hi>Hospitality,</hi> at large; and tells him, <hi>Croesus</hi> was renown'd for these Vertues, and <hi>Phalaris</hi> infamous for the want of 'em. Which I would have observ'd, because if he be not speaking here of Beneficence to <hi>Poets and Men of Letters,</hi> Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> might as well have undertaken to prove his point from <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>After all, the Dr's Opinion and Mine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this point are not so very distant as he may imagine: for I agree with him, that there was no <hi>Extraordinary Dearness</hi> between <hi>Stesichorus</hi> and <hi>Phalaris</hi>; nor do <hi>the Letters</hi> themselves imply that there was. They say indeed that <hi>Phalaris</hi> oblig'd and courted <hi>Stesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chorus,</hi> out of Vanity, or a Real Esteem of his Merit. And <hi>Stesichorus</hi> could not but pay
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:98199:61"/>
some Regard to <hi>Phalaris,</hi> on this account; tho' he could never Love Him, or his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter: nor is there any Proof from the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, that he did. <hi>Phalaris,</hi> after he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him his Life, desir'd only his Friendship in return; and <hi>Stesichorus</hi> was oblig'd both in Gratitude and Prudence, not to stand off; but to be in as Good Terms as he could with a Man that was able to do him so much Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief. We have a Lively Account of just such a management as this between <hi>Iulius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi> and <hi>Tully,</hi> in the Epistles of the Latter. When <hi>Caesar</hi> had got the better of <hi>Pompey,</hi> whose Side <hi>Tully</hi> took, either out of a true Esteem for <hi>Tully</hi>'s Vertues, or out of Design, he took all Methods of making him his Own; pay'd him a great many Civilities, and did him a great many Services. <hi>Tul'y</hi> could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver from his Heart love a Tyrant, but we may imagine how he behav'd in this case; he accepted <hi>Caesar</hi>'s proffer'd Friendship, wrote Civilly to him, and lay still. No more than this, that I can see, ever pass'd between <hi>Stesichorus</hi> and <hi>Phalaris,</hi> to speak upon the Foot of the Letters: and if so, what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s Harangue about the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of Authors, in relation to this fancied Intimacy and Dearness? Good Writers must needs say nothing of that which never hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd. <hi>Stesichorus</hi>'s Love for <hi>Phalaris</hi> could no more be the Subject of any of the Pens that went before us, than Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s <hi>Humanity</hi> will be of any of the Pens that shall come after us. 'Tis Easie then to answer for the <hi>Silence of Authors</hi> upon This Head; whether it can be justified as well upon the Next, I shall now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:98199:61"/>IN my Preface to <hi>Phalaris,</hi> among the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections that might be rais'd against the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles, I mention'd This for One, that they had, for ought we knew, <hi>lain a Thousand Years without being taken notice of.</hi> Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> has been pleas'd to resume this slight Argument of mine, as he did that of the <hi>Dialect,</hi> and give it a place among his Irrefragable Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: an Honour which, I must own, it no ways deserves. For, tho' he has taken this occasion of shewing his Extraordinary Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in Wit and Raillery, and tells us, the Epistles were <hi>preserv'd in the Parchments of</hi> Jove, <hi>and buried in some Secret Cave under Ground, or else they had certainly gone to Pot</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Dissert. <hi>p.</hi> 63.</note>: yet I suppose he does not in good Earnest think it any great Wonder, that Mortal Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum should endure a Thousand Years; or that a small Parcel of Letters should lye so many Ages without being mention'd by any Author now extant; a Thing not altogether Incredible, because it has actually happen'd to other Books besides <hi>Phalaris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vellejus Paterculus,</hi> an Elegant Writer, and one that tells us several Particulars, not to be met with in other Roman Historians, might with more reason expect to be taken notice of than Our Author: yet perhaps Dr. <hi>Bent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> won't meet with any plain mention of his Writings for <hi>Five Centuries</hi> after he writ, till <hi>Priscian</hi> quotes him, and that only in a point of Grammar. After this time he'll be as much at a loss to find any Footsteps of him for <hi>Nine Hundred Years</hi> more, down to the Age of <hi>Aventinus:</hi> and yet the Criticks
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:98199:62"/>
have receiv'd him without being so nice as to examine, what <hi>Secret Cave he was conceal'd in. Phoedrus,</hi> as far as I can find, was never mention'd by any Author since <hi>Avienus,</hi> till his Fables were in this Age brought to light by <hi>Pithaeus,</hi> after they had been lost <hi>above a Thousand Years. Lactantius de Mortibus Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutorum,</hi> was a Book which the World had not seen since St. <hi>Ierome</hi>'s time, till, after <hi>a Thousand Years, Baluze</hi> discover'd it in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Library of <hi>Colebert,</hi> and made it pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. Now, as our Dissertator learnedly argues, if these Books lay <hi>untouch'd and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stirr'd,</hi> they must have <hi>moulder'd away:</hi> if they were us'd during these Ten Centuries, <hi>Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body would surely have spoken of 'em.</hi> Either the Dr. must give up these Authors as Spurious, or these Objections as Slight and Frivolous; and own, that the <hi>Silence</hi> of the Ancients is not a <hi>Direct,</hi> but (as any-body else would have thought, and call'd it) a very <hi>Indirect</hi> Argument against 'em: tho' still not quite so indirect as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that he founds upon a Disagreement between <hi>Lucian,</hi> and the <hi>Epistles,</hi> in their Accounts of <hi>Phalaris.</hi> This does not come properly under the head I am now speaking to: however, because he has thrown toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther here Two or Three Paultry Proofs, that would make no Figure by themselves, I shall take 'em as they lye before me. The Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Relations concerning <hi>Phalaris</hi> given by <hi>Lucian,</hi> and the <hi>Epistles,</hi> I urg'd formerly <note n="*" place="margin">Preface to my E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of <hi>Phalaris.</hi>
               </note> as a Proof that <hi>Lucian</hi> could not write them. But as He has manag'd it, at second hand, to shew, that <hi>Lucian does as good as expresly declare
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:98199:62"/>
he never saw 'em,</hi> it either proves nothing, or proves too much; even that <hi>Lucian</hi> never saw <hi>Timaeus,</hi> as Learned as he was, and as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as he mentions him. For <hi>Timaeus</hi> relates, that the <hi>Agrigentines</hi> threw the <hi>Brazen Bull</hi> into the Sea; but <hi>Lucian</hi> says, <hi>Phalaris</hi> sent it to <hi>Delphos.</hi> What I should gather from hence would be, that <hi>Lucian</hi> overlook'd that and many other Authorities, and did not confine himself to strict History in a Declamation: but, according to Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s manner of drawing Consequences, it must follow, that <hi>Timaeus</hi> no more writ his History, than <hi>Phala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> did his Letters; for <hi>Lucian</hi> equally contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts Both; and for that reason is a Bad Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence against either of them. Now if <hi>Lucian</hi> himself be of no Authority in this point, much less are <hi>those Authors he follow'd</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Dissert. <hi>p.</hi> 65.</note>, which Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> summons up as so many <hi>Witnesses against</hi> the Epistles. I would ask him how <hi>many</hi> Witnesses these are? where they liv'd? what are their Names, and the Names of the Books they wrote? `Tis very hard to urge such Testimonies against us, as are not now, and probably never were in being: For <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,</hi> in this Harangue, seems to tye himself up to no Authors, nor to be guided by any thing but his own Invention: and this the Dr. him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self confesses in another place <note n="†" place="margin">Dissert. <hi>p.</hi> 62.</note>; where he says, Lucian <hi>feigns an Embassy from</hi> Phalaris <hi>to</hi> Delphi. And if the Ground of this whole Discourse were a <hi>Fiction,</hi> why does the Dr. here argue from it as seriously as if it were copy'd from the most Authentic Histories then extant? how can he allow himself to put such an Air of Gravity upon what he
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:98199:63"/>
knows to be such a Trifle? We shall have him, at this rate, in his next Dissertation, solemnly quoting <hi>Lucian</hi>'s <hi>Vera Historia</hi> too, and the unknown <hi>Authors which he follow'd.</hi> But I suppose he resolv'd to make the best advantage he could of these Poor Colours, for want of Better Authorities: For the Two Historians he brings to strengthen his Proof, say nothing that is inconsistent with the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles. Jamblichus, he says, <hi>brings in</hi> Abaris <hi>in company with</hi> Pythagoras <hi>to</hi> Phalaris; <hi>but in the Epistles</hi> Abaris <hi>refuses to come.</hi> Who would not have refus'd an Invitation from <hi>Phalaris,</hi> till he had good assurances that he might come with Safety? Report had told him very dismal Stories of him, and dress'd him up in frightful Colours; <hi>Abaris</hi> perhaps did not know at first, but that <hi>Phalaris</hi> might Live upon Philosophers Flesh; or might have a Fancy to try, which made his Bull Roar best, a <hi>Scythian,</hi> or a <hi>Sicilian:</hi> an Experiment, which <hi>Abaris</hi> by no means car'd to have made upon him; for he came from a Cold Country, and had a very particular Aversion to Fire. These were very Important matters, and if he should not have taken care to be fully satisfied in 'em before he ventur'd his Person, he had not been quite so <hi>Wise</hi> a man as he was thought to be; for one part of Wisdom is to be <hi>Cautious. Pythagoras</hi> therefore manag'd at the very same rate; he often refus'd to come <note n="*" place="margin">Ep. LXXIV.</note>, and yet came at last: why might not this be the case of <hi>Abaris?</hi> This is a very easie way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling <hi>Phalaris</hi> with <hi>Iamblichus</hi>; and he does not differ so widely from <hi>Heraclides</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but that They too may be brought
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:98199:63"/>
(with Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s Leave, and in his <hi>Carriers</hi> Phrase) <hi>to set Horses together. Phalaris</hi> says, he was an <hi>Orphan,</hi> before he came to <hi>Agrigent</hi>; and yet <hi>Heraclides</hi> says his Mother was burnt there. Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> has given a Clear Soluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Difficulty himself; and frankly owns, that his <hi>Mother</hi> might be burnt, tho' his <hi>Father</hi> dy'd long before. <hi>But how,</hi> says he, <hi>came the Old Woman to be roasted at</hi> Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, <hi>if</hi> Phalaris <hi>fled alone from</hi> Astypalaea, <hi>neither Wife nor Child, nor any Relation following him, according to the Epistles</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Dissert. <hi>p.</hi> 65.</note>? I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member any such Epistle in my Edition of <hi>Phalaris</hi>; but if there should be such an one in the King's MS, I'll answer this Objection to it, when the Library-keeper is in so good an Humor, as to favour me with a Sight of it: Till then I may be excus'd from prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this Point any further. Only I must ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to the Dr, that either he uses some Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py of <hi>Heraclides</hi> that I have not seen; or else cites him for what he does not say. Both Here, and in the 30th Page of his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertation, he tells us, that <hi>Heraclides</hi> affirms <hi>Phalaris</hi> to have been <hi>burnt</hi> by the <hi>Agrigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi>; whereas he only says, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 'Tis true, it's all one to his purpose, whether he was burnt, or any other way put to Death: but he has such a Facility of Misunderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Misrepresenting Authors, to serve a Turn, that he does it, even when it is of no service to him.</p>

               </gap>s <hi>General Arguments,</hi> that none of 'em can be thought to affect the whole <hi>Body</hi> of the Epistles: if his Objections against some <hi>Particular</hi> Letters have no more Weight in 'em, he's the best Patron <hi>Phalaris</hi> has yet met with; for the next Happiness to being very well Defended, is that of being very weakly Oppos'd. All his Attacks of this kind are grounded upon <hi>Chronology:</hi> and therefore, before he could make any Approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, he was oblig'd to settle the Time of <hi>Phalaris.</hi> And first he gives us the account of <hi>Eusebius</hi> thus.

In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of <hi>Ol.</hi> XXXVII, he means, I suppose, <hi>Ol.</hi> XXXVIII, as 'tis in <hi>Eusebius</hi>; or else his Reckoning of 28 Years (which he could bring in here, for no other Reason, but to shew his Skill in Counting) is false. However, he is willing to allow, that (according to St. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,</hi> and <hi>Suidas</hi>) Phalaris<hi>'s Government com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menc'd</hi> Ol. LIII. 3. <hi>and expir'd</hi> Ol.

But by his Niceness in Computation he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes himself in the same Breath, and says, Pythagoras <hi>was not taken notice of in</hi> Greece <hi>till</hi> 80 <hi>Years after</hi> Ol. XXXVIII. (for I'll suppose XXXVII a false Print) <hi>i. e.</hi> Three Years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

               <hi>Phalaris</hi> dy'd. And yet <hi>Pythagoras</hi> had a great Name in <hi>Greece</hi> many Years before he came into <hi>Sicily.</hi> So that Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> has ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd this Point with a particular Dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and prov'd that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and <hi>Phalaris</hi> could not be acquainted, by that very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count which he accepted of meerly to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance their acquaintance. A most auspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Entrance upon his Chronological Proofs! doubtless all the rest will be made out with Equal Force and Clearness! Here's a Page spent to give us his Opinion about the Age of <hi>Phalaris,</hi> where he has so contriv'd to say one thing, and prove another, that we are still at a loss to know what his Opinion is. Just such another Instance of his Consisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy he gives us about <hi>Xerxes</hi>'s Expedition. P. 13th he says, <hi>'twas Ol.</hi> 73. P. 85th he says, <hi>the very next Olympiad after</hi> Xerxes<hi>'s</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition <hi>Hiero</hi> was in the Throne; and quotes <hi>Diodorus</hi> (xi. <hi>p.</hi> 39.) for it: where we read that <hi>Hiero</hi> came to the Crown Ol. LXXV. 3. Therefore here Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> is of opinion, that <hi>Xerxes</hi>'s Expedition was in the 74th Olympiad. And yet if <hi>Diodorus</hi> is to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd, (and he always believes him, when it is for his Turn to do so <note n="(a)" place="margin">Vide <hi>Diss. p.</hi> 88.</note>) <hi>Xerxes</hi>'s Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was neither in the 73d, nor 74th, but 75th Olympiad. If Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> be so Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relsome, that he cannot agree with himself, how is it possible for other people to agree with him? I would willingly allow of any Date of <hi>Phalaris</hi> that he is inclin'd to admit: but since he has express'd himself so intricate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that 'tis hard to know which way he is determin'd, I'll take the most receiv'd Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:98199:65"/>
and go on to shew, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing any of <hi>His</hi> Discoveries, the Epistles might have been written before the 58th Olympiad.</p>
            <p>He begins his Chronological Observations with the <hi>Aeras</hi> of some Cities mention'd in the Epistles; a very Slippery Foundation to build an Argument upon! for all these Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are so very ancient, that it would puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle one of a Greater Reach in Chronology than Dr. <hi>Bentley,</hi> to trace their Originals. The Oldest Historians now extant had but very Slender Memoirs of those times, and accordingly we find their Accounts so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd and contradictory, that No-body but a Man of Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s Judgment would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to draw Demonstrations from 'em. I hear the Famous Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> (who surpasses Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> in Learning as much as he does in Candour and Modesty) is now printing some Lectures at <hi>Oxford,</hi> in which he shews, how very obscure and uncertain the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of those Ages are; and that from the Concurrence of those Rude Accounts he meets with, he has made it probable that <hi>Phalaris</hi> must be brought much lower than even St. <hi>Hierome</hi> places him. This perhaps would cut off most of the Dr's Arguments at One Blow; but for want of this assistance, I must encounter 'em singly: and be content to wander with him thro' those Woods and Mazes in which he often loses both Himself and his Reader. But before I follow him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Dark Scene, I will consider a little the Tendency of this way of arguing in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. He would prove that <hi>Phalaris</hi> could
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:98199:65"/>
not possibly be the Author of these Letters, because some Places are mention'd there un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der such Names, as he thinks were given 'em since the Age of <hi>Phalaris.</hi> Does he know Whose this Sort of Proof is, and to what Ill Purpose it has been employ'd? It is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for being made use of by <hi>Spinosa</hi> to ruine the Authority of <hi>Moses</hi>'s Writings; which he would prove not to be His (just as our Chronologer here does) from Places being mention'd in 'em, more Modern than He. Ought the Dr. in a Doubting Age to have employ'd such an Argument, without the utmost Caution and Guard? Ought he to have propos'd it so Generally and Crude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without informing his Reader, how far it held, and where it fail'd? what Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were necessary to be made to it, and of what Solutions it was capable? Is he so Eager to prove <hi>Phalaris</hi> Spurious, that he cares not whether the Authority of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Writings sink with him? But I hope he does n't think there's any more Weight in <hi>Spinosa</hi>'s, than I think there is in His Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments. The General Answer I have heard given upon this occasion is, that these Names were chang'd since <hi>Moses</hi> writ, to make his History more intelligible to those, to whom the ancient Names of those Towns and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries were no longer known. And this Plea therefore I might fairly lay hold of for <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laris,</hi> if there were any need of it; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume, that the Copyers of these Letters might alter some of the Old Names to such as were of more known and familiar Use in their Time. But I have no occasion to say this,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:98199:66"/>
till Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> has clearly prov'd some of the Names of Cities mention'd there to be later than <hi>Phalaris,</hi> which, I think, with all his little Skill in puzzling Accounts, he has not been able to do.</p>

Perhaps the Dr. will bravely stand to what he has here inconsiderately said, that all these Authors mean the same place: If so, (which I am far from Granting) why may not <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> be mistaken as much in the <hi>Date</hi> of this Town, as two Good Witnesses prove him to be in the <hi>Situation</hi> of it? unless this <hi>Phintias</hi> be such another Place as <hi>Agrigent,</hi> a Seaport Town in the <hi>middle of Sicily</hi>

            <p>In the same Epistle, from whence Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> took an occasion of giving us this large and ingenuous account of <hi>Zancle</hi> and <hi>Messana,</hi> the <hi>Tauromenites</hi> were mention'd with the <hi>Zan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleans</hi>; [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] upon which I expected, that when he had dispatch'd the <hi>Zancleans,</hi> he would have fallen upon the <hi>Tauromenites:</hi> but to shew his Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to any thing that looks like Order or Method, he postpones 'em, to intermix some Proofs of a different Nature. I have already excus'd my self from following him in his Rambles, and shall consider <hi>Tauromenium</hi> here in its proper place. The only Authority he
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:98199:71"/>
has brought to prove <hi>Tauromenium</hi> so nam'd since the time of <hi>Phalaris,</hi> is that of <hi>Diodorus,</hi> which I mention'd in my Preface; and own'd to be a clear Proof against <hi>Phalaris,</hi> if it might be rely'd on. But <hi>Diodorus</hi> is in two Stories, which, as Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> (after his way of citing Authors) has put 'em together, look plausibly enough; but, as <hi>Diodorus</hi> himself tells 'em, are utterly inconsistent. In his 14th Book he says, that some <hi>Sicilians</hi> plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themselves upon <hi>Taurus,</hi> and from their Settlement there call'd the place they built, <hi>Tauromenium:</hi> In the 16th Book, he says, that about 40 Years after this, <hi>Andromachus</hi> plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed some of the Old <hi>Naxians</hi> upon <hi>Taurus,</hi> and from his long stay there call'd the place where he planted 'em, <hi>Tauromenium.</hi> Thus <hi>Diodorus</hi> plainly gives us Two different ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of the Time when the Place was <hi>nam'd</hi>; either of which, I confess, would serve Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s purpose: but since they contradict one-another, neither of them is to be depended on. If Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> pleads, that they do not contradict one-another, because the Place might be twice call'd so, for One and the Same Reason; why will not the Same Reason equally hold for its being call'd so, long before <hi>Phalaris</hi> liv'd? Doubtless the <hi>Sicilians</hi> had often before his time resorted to the Strong Holds of that Mountain. Nay, <hi>Thucydides</hi> expresly tells us <note n="(a)" place="margin">L. 6, § 15.</note>, that there were of old People that inhabited the Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly parts about <hi>Naxos:</hi> and 'tis not improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that These might be call'd <gap reason="foreign">

together, and a City was built (tho' we don't know when that was) that City might be call'd <hi>Tauromenium.</hi> 'Tis observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that <hi>Phalaris,</hi> tho' he has very often oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to mention these People, yet never names any such Town as <hi>Tauromenium</hi>; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver calls 'em <hi>Citizens,</hi> nor uses any such Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression as implys, they belong'd to any <hi>City.</hi> This could scarce have happen'd, if a Sophist had writ these Letters: but 'tis no wonder that <hi>Phalaris</hi> should write so, because there might be <hi>Tauromenites,</hi> as there was a River <hi>Tauromenius</hi> (if <hi>Vibius Sequester</hi> be to be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited, who says the Town had its Name from thence) before there was a <hi>Tauromenium.</hi> So that Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> would have no reason to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over the Defenders of <hi>Phalaris,</hi> if he could prove <hi>Tauromenium</hi> of a Later Date; much less, since he cannot prove it, ought he so insultingly to call upon 'em, <hi>Where are those that cry up</hi> Phalaris <hi>for the florid Author of these Letters, who was burnt in his Own Bull above</hi> 150 <hi>Years before</hi> Tauro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menium <hi>was ever thought of</hi>

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:98199:72"/>
that he would rather venture upon False History, than lose it. The Witticism is something remote, as it stands here; but when he is at leisure to put this Disser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation into Latin, 'twill receive a Great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
            <p>TWas not to be hop'd, that these Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure Points concerning the <hi>Building and Peopling Ancient Towns</hi> should be so far clear'd and settl'd, as to make 'em a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to a Plain and Direct Proof against the Epistles: However it was a piece of Learning not unworthy of a Scholar's Pains; and by a Skilful Hand might have been made useful to some Other purpose. I would not therefore be thought to disparage Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> for enquiring into this matter, tho' he has happen'd to leave it more obscure than he found it; His Attempt was Commendable, whatever his Success has been: but Now, methinks, he stoops very low; from the Rise and <hi>Aera's</hi> of <hi>Cities,</hi> to the <hi>Chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy</hi> of <hi>Old Sayings</hi> and <hi>Proverbs.</hi> This would make a much more suitable <hi>Appendix</hi> to a <hi>Vocabulary,</hi> than to an History of <hi>Ancient and Modern Learning.</hi> 'Tis so dry and fruitless, and so little to the purpose, that I am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most tempted to break my promise, and leave this part of his Dissertation unexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd.

But how does he prove, <hi>it puzzl'd the WHOLE City?</hi> plainly! be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause One of the <hi>Eldest Citizens hit upon't, and told the meaning of it.</hi> This is very Nice Reasoning: but he goes on to refine upon it; and suspects that Herodotus <hi>himself was the first Broacher of that Expression:</hi> for (says he) <hi>those first Historians made every-bodys Speeches for 'em.</hi> Therefore <hi>Herodotus</hi> made this, which is no <hi>Speech,</hi> but only a <hi>Message!</hi>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:98199:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>
However, let <hi>Herodotus</hi> have worded this Message; does the same <hi>Herodotus</hi> tell us, that the <hi>Lampsacenes</hi> were puzzl'd with an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression invented by <hi>Herodotus?</hi> Were the Men of <hi>Lampsacus</hi> in <hi>Croesus</hi>'s time at a Loss to understand a Phrase, that was not thought of, till <hi>Herodotus</hi> an Hundred Years afterwards coin'd it? 'Tis wonderful to Me, how such a Piece of Reasoning as this could ever enter into an Head, that has Brains in it! All the Dr. has to countenance it, is the <hi>Title</hi> of a <hi>Lost Chapter</hi> in <hi>Gellius:</hi> from whence he takes occasion to guess at what's Lost there, and to give us a wrong translation of what's Left: <hi>Caesam,</hi> which in <hi>Herodotus</hi>'s Greek is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, he renders <hi>Lop'd,</hi> instead of <hi>Cut down:</hi> Now, that a Pinetree <hi>perishes by Lop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,</hi> is, I believe, as he says, <hi>News to the Naturalists.</hi> I could not avoid taking notice of this little Mistake, because he repeats it over and over agen; and endeavours, in his awkward way, to squeeze Mirth out of it. <hi>Gellius</hi> indeed, remembring a Passage in <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus,</hi> where it was affirm'd, that the Pine was the only Tree, which would not shoot out after it was cut down, might say, <hi>Quòd parùm verè dixerit Herodotus,</hi> &amp;c. because he did not nicely examin upon what Occasion this was brought in by <hi>Herodotus</hi>; or what was said <hi>in Herodotus</hi> he might in a Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion say well enough, was said <hi>by</hi> him: but to tell us the Story of the <hi>Lampsacenes</hi> being at a Loss to understand the Message of <hi>Croesus,</hi> and yet to think this Expression first broach'd by <hi>Herodotus,</hi> is such an Instance of <hi>Oscita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> 
               <note n="(a)" place="margin">P. 119.</note>, as I could not easily imagine, that
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:98199:73"/>
even Our Dissertator could be guilty of. He tells us of <hi>Dreaming Pedants, with their Elbows on their Desks</hi>; but surely the Man that writ this must have been <hi>fast asleep,</hi> for else he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have talk'd so wildly. If <hi>Herodotus</hi> is to be believ'd, <hi>Croesus</hi> us'd this Expression; if he is not to be believ'd, why is he brought to prove any thing? <hi>Herodotus</hi> is so far from asserting that <hi>Croesus</hi> was the Author of this Proverbial Saying, that from this very Story we may gather, that he was not the Author of it. For when he sent a Message to the <hi>Lampsacenes,</hi> which he expected should imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately be obey'd, would he put it into such a Phrase as they were not likely to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend? It stands to reason, that he thought the expression Common enough; or else he would not have us'd it on this occasion. All that we certainly learn from <hi>Herodotus</hi> is, that this Saying must be as Old, at least, as <hi>Croesus</hi>; from whence one would be apt to conclude it to be probably as Old as <hi>Phalaris,</hi> who is plac'd but very few Years above him.</p>
            <p>When the Dr's head ran upon Old Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, how came <hi>Nihil est dictum quod non dictum prius,</hi> to escape him? This One, well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, would have done him more service than all the <hi>Greek, Latin,</hi> and <hi>English</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs with which he embellishes his Disser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; it would have shew'd him how vain it is to pretend to trace the Originals of Words and Phrases; and that even the <hi>Aera's</hi> of Cities may be fix'd much sooner than They. However the Dr. launches still out into further Discoveries of this kind; he has
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:98199:74"/>
met with a <hi>Sentence of Moral</hi> 
               <note n="(a)" place="margin">Disser. <hi>p.</hi> 33.</note>, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which <hi>notable Saying,</hi> he tells us, <hi>had not</hi> Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laris <hi>modestly hinted that Others had said it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, we might have taken for his Own.</hi> He seems here to blame <hi>Phalaris</hi> for being <hi>modest,</hi> and for hinting that he borrow'd this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression from <hi>others,</hi> when he might as well have put it upon us for his <hi>own:</hi> the Dr, I believe, will never be blam'd upon either of these accounts. But would he really have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken this Saying for <hi>Phalaris</hi>'s Own, if there had been no hint of his borrowing it? and yet when <hi>Phalaris</hi> says, 'tis Older than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, will he take it to be Younger? He reckons up several Authors that pretend to it, <hi>Democritus, Simonides,</hi> and the <hi>Lacedaemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>; and decides in favour of <hi>Democritus,</hi> for a very good reason; because otherwise it would be of no use to him in the present Debate. But I am so far from yielding it up to <hi>Democritus,</hi> that I say <hi>Democritus</hi> lays no claim to it. <hi>Plutarch</hi> says, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; perhaps he had met with this in some Passage in <hi>Democritus</hi>'s Works; but it will not follow from hence that <hi>Democritus</hi> was the Author of it. Many <hi>Proverbial Gnomae,</hi> in all Languages, are to be met with in the Dr's Dissertation; but No-body will allow his Way of Arguing from 'em: Either these <hi>Gnomae</hi> are Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s own, or else he is a <hi>Sorry Plagiary. Laertius,</hi> the other Witness produc'd for <hi>Democritus,</hi> is as far from making <hi>Democritus</hi> the Author of this Sentence, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> is. In his Life of <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critus</hi> we find, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. But in another place he tells us <note n="(b)" place="margin">Life of <hi>Solon.</hi>

               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:98199:74" rendition="simple:additions"/>
according to <hi>Laertius</hi>'s account, and Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s Reasoning, must still have <hi>filch'd</hi> this Saying. And from the Variety of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concerning the Original of it, I have more reason to suppose it older than <hi>Phala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> than Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> has to presume it Later. Here are Four Authors, that have an Equal Pretence to it; and if it be given to any of the Four, except <hi>Democritus, Phalaris</hi> might have us'd it after 'em: but I rather think that none of 'em have any Title to it. It is not an Observation of so deep a Reach, but that it might have been hit upon an hundred Times, by Men no wiser than Dr. <hi>Bentley,</hi> or my self, before the Pens of <hi>Phalaris</hi> or <hi>Democritus</hi> made it famous.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> goes on detecting <hi>Phalaris</hi>'s Thefts; but for Ornaments sake, the Phrase is varied. He finds him, in the next Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph, <hi>filching</hi> a <hi>Moral Sentence</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Dissert. <hi>p.</hi> 35.</note>; in the Last, it was a <hi>Sentence of Moral:</hi> which is the Only Change of Style, that I have observ'd in Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s Dissertation for the better; and therefore I ought to give him the Praise of it. The Moral Sentence is this, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which is stollen, he says, from an <hi>Iambic</hi> Verse cited in <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Rhetoric, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. But why might not this Iambic Verse be as well stolen from <hi>Phalaris?</hi> or why might not both the Poet and the Prince be equally beholden to a Moral Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence more ancient than either of them? Were there no Moral Sentences before the Days of <hi>Phalaris?</hi> Or, supposing Phalaris had this Jambic Verse in his Eye, how does it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:98199:75" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that this Verse was not Older than He? <hi>Aristotle,</hi> who cites it without a Name, leaves us in the dark, as to the Time of it. And how will the Dr's Conjecturing Faculty help him out here? will he pretend by <hi>the Thread and Colour of it's Style</hi> to judge to what Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it belongs? Ay, but it is <hi>a Proverbial Gnome,</hi> he says, and therefore <hi>PROBABLY borrow'd from the Stage; and CONSEQVENT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LY must be later than</hi> Phalaris, <hi>let it belong to what Poet You please, Tragic or Comic</hi> 
               <note n="(a)" place="margin">Differ. <hi>p.</hi> 35.</note>.

            </p>
            <p>Hitherto <hi>Phalaris</hi> has stolen discreetly, and borrow'd Expressions proper for him to use; but now, it seems he steals without Decency or Distinction, out of <hi>Callimachus,</hi> and <hi>Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar.</hi> For we find Two Words close together in Him, that are found as near one another in Each of those Authors. <hi>Phalaris</hi> has <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> &amp;c? 'Tis a very inconsiderable Alteration, and yet it salves all: for that there was such a Cup, nam'd from <hi>Hercules,</hi> and therefore Old enough for <hi>Phalaris</hi> to use, we need go no further than <hi>Athenaeus</hi> to be inform'd; who, in his <hi>Catalogue of Cups,</hi> mentions the <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>To fix the Age of <hi>Thericles,</hi> from whom these Cups are presum'd to have their Name, the Dr. cites <hi>Athenaeus, One Witness indeed, but as GOOD as a Multitude,</hi> he says, <hi>in a matter of this nature</hi>

have said <hi>as Many:</hi> for why should One Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness be as Good as a Multitude in Cases of this Nature? in Other Cases, I am sure, it is not: He may attaint <hi>Phalaris</hi> indeed upon a Single Evidence, but he can never in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Course of Justice convict him; and yet the Dr. promis'd us to give him <hi>a Fair and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Tryal</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">P. 19.</note>. If now there are several ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Circumstances that disparage this One Witness's Testimony; if he liv'd at a great distance from the Time he writes of; if he speaks by Report and Hearsay only, without vouching any Authority; if he expresses him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self so, that we have room to doubt, whether we know his mind; or, should we know his mind, yet if he contradicts himself imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately afterward: I say, if these things ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear against him, then this <hi>One Witness</hi> is so far from being as good as a <hi>Multitude,</hi> that he is as <hi>good as None.</hi> And I believe That will appear to be the Case, after I have examin'd him.</p>
            <p>Had <hi>Athenaeus</hi> given us an Account of the Author of an Invention in his Own Time, or a little before him, we could easily have cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited him upon his Word: but when he speaks of an Invention of 600 Years stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and pretends nicely to fix the Date of it, without telling us from what Author he drew his Account, we may be allow'd to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect his Exactness.

Had he known himself from what Author he drew this account, he would without fail, have told us; for he treads not a single Step without an Authority, if he can have one: and we may therefore conclude, that he had none; and that the only reason, which determin'd him to fix the Age of <hi>Theri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> about <hi>Aristophanes</hi>'s time was, that he had not set down in his <hi>Adversaria,</hi> nor did at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent call to mind a mention of the <hi>Thericlean</hi> Cup in any Writer more ancient than He. For observable it is, that among the Several Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations in which he abounds on this head, there is none that runs higher than the Age of that Poet.

            <p>But let this be as it will — From what I have produc'd out of <hi>Athenaeus,</hi> I think, it manifestly appears, that no Weight is to be laid upon what He says in the point, who talks so loosely and waveringly about it; who produces Opinions on one side, and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions on t'other, who takes up a Report, an Hearsay in one page, and contradicts it by a Substantial Testimony from an Approved Author, in another; and is all over Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistency, and Confusion. A Witness that thus talks forwards and backwards, in a breath, ought to be set aside by consent of Both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and leave the Merits of the Cause to be decided by clearer Testimonies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:98199:82"/>And now what becomes of the Pompous Character, with which Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> introduces this Single Evidence? <hi>One indeed, but as good as a Multitude!</hi> I agree with the Dr. if he means a Multitude of such Suborn'd Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses as he has brought to blast the Credit of <hi>Phalaris</hi>; One good Honest Downright Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness were worth 'em All: but Such, I think, I have prov'd <hi>Atheneus</hi> not to be in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Debate. However, if after what has been offer'd, the Reader should still be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to believe this One Hearsay Witness, I desire him to remember, that his Evidence lies within a Narrow Compass, and that he affects but One Epistle: So that should That, where the <hi>Thericlean Cup</hi> is mention'd prove Spurious, yet the other 147 may, to our Comfort, be Genuine still. And this Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration I hope the Reader has carried along with him thro' all the <hi>Particular Proofs,</hi> that they touch only those Particular Epistles from whence they are taken, but do not affect the whole Body of 'em; for a Passage, or Part of a Book may be Spurious, and yet the Book it self not be Spurious: especially when it is a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of Pieces, that have no Dependence upon one another, as <hi>Epistles, Epigrams, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles</hi>; the First Number of which may have been encreas'd by the Wantonness, or Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Imitators in after-times, and yet the Book be Authentic in the main, and an Original still.</p>

               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:98199:83"/>There are some Other Important Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies which Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> has occasionally han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled in this Paragraph; as whether <hi>Thericles</hi> was a <hi>Turner,</hi> or a <hi>Potter</hi>

            <p>But to return to our Business — I have now examin'd, I think, all that is material in Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s Objection about the <hi>Theri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Cups,</hi> as far as the Authority of the Letters is concern'd in it: his Exception against My way of <hi>Translating</hi> the Word shall not be forgotten in its proper place; when I come to consider the Faults he has found with my Edition and Version.</p>
            <p>This has I confess been a Long Article; but the next will make us amends; for I can hardly perswade my self to say any thing to it.

He knew better how to Please the Man he was to Profit by: as little Good Nature as he had left, yet he had some Civility, and a great deal of Sense; and by the help of these, escap'd that Absurd Management, which Dr. <hi>Bentley,</hi> I find, had he been advis'd with, would have put him upon.</p>
            <p>But <hi>how came the Fame of so small a Business</hi> [as <hi>Pythagoras</hi>'s assuming this Name] <hi>to reach</hi> Phalaris<hi>'s Ear?</hi> He may as well ask, how he came to hear his Name was <hi>Pythagoras?</hi> Fame, that told him the One, must tell him the Other too, after once <hi>Pythagoras</hi> had set up his Pretensions; and I desire Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> to prove that <hi>Phalaris</hi> ever nam'd him so before: and till he does That, the Epistles are safe from any Harm that this small Objection can do 'em.</p>
            <p>Before I go further, I must observe to the Reader an Instance of Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s great Goodness, which deserves to be taken notice of: <hi>I could shew</hi> (says he) <hi>from a whole Crowd of Authors, that</hi> Pythagoras <hi>first invented the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:98199:86"/>
word: but I content my self with Two.</hi> To content himself with Two Quotations, when he could produce so Many; and that upon so Clear and Manifest a point, that he need not have produc'd Any, (in which Cases He is usually most Liberal of his Learning) is no Common Favour; and I ought therefore (as I do) thankfully to own it. It almost tempts me to drop a Question or two that I had to ask him here; as, what he means by saying, that Pythagoras <hi>first nam'd Philosophy?</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that he first nam'd That Philosophy, which before was call'd Wisdom? and why, if he meant so, he did not say so <note n="(a)" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, says <hi>Laer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> whom he translates; but it follows presently, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: which makes the Expression not so improper in <hi>Laertius</hi>'s Greek, as Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s English.</note>? And what again he would be at, when he tells us, that <hi>Pythagoras invented</hi> the word <hi>first?</hi> and who it was that Invented it <hi>Last</hi>? Something too I had to say to him about <hi>Nurses</hi> talking <hi>Philosophy</hi> 
               <note n="(b)" place="margin">Dissertat. <hi>p.</hi> 39.</note>: But he has been very merciful in this Paragraph; and I forgive in my Turn.</p>
            <p>There is still behind One Exception to the Credit of the Epistles, taken from the Names of some Tragoedians, there, and no where else to be found; and from the Age and <hi>Date of Tragedy</hi> it self. The Section in which this Argument is manag'd is a short one, but very fruitful in Mistakes, and those of the First Rate; for which reason, and because it is the Last trouble of the kind I am likely to give the Reader, I shall insist upon it somewhat largely.</p>

But not having consider'd This Piece of History sufficiently, I will not be positive in it: there is Another, in which I have somewhat better Grounds to go upon; 'tis the Instance of <hi>Chlonthachonthlus.</hi> He was no Poet indeed, but pretty near akin to one, a Lymaker by Profession, and a famous Misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenter. Perhaps the Dr. has never heard of him to this day; and perhaps he'll know as little of him two or three Years hence, as he does now: and yet I assure him He's to be met with in a Celebrated Greek Author, in Whom he lies buried, and unknown to many of the Great Lights of the Commonwealth of Learning, because that Good Author has the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:98199:87"/>
Misfortune to be put out without a Good <hi>Index.</hi> Now I'll undertake to trace <hi>Aristolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> or <hi>Lysinus,</hi> as soon as Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> shall <hi>Chlonthachonthlus</hi>: and when he lights upon him, he'll find, that the Author, where he is, is confessedly Genuine, notwithstanding he mentions this unheard-of Monster of a Man, whom no-body ever mention'd since or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.</p>
            <p>But Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> has a better Objection than the Silence of Authors against these Tragoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians; he says, they could not have a being in <hi>Phalaris</hi>'s time, because there was then no such thing as <hi>Tragoedy</hi> it self: <hi>neither the Word nor Thing being known, while</hi> Phalaris <hi>tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niz'd at</hi> Agrigentum. <hi>But</hi> Thespis <hi>was the first Inventor of it, who acted his First Tragoedy twelve Years after the Death of</hi> Phalaris: and both <hi>the Name</hi> and the <hi>Thing</hi> were then (and not till then) <hi>born together</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="margin">Dissert. <hi>p.</hi> 90.</note>. In Opposition to this, I shall endeavour to make out these Three things: first, that, granting <hi>Thespis</hi> to have been the Inventor of Tragoedy, yet he found it out early enough for <hi>Phalaris</hi> to have the use of the Word from him: in the next place, that Tragoedy was much Older than <hi>Thespis</hi>; and that He was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Improver, but not the Inventer of it: and yet further, that the <hi>Word</hi> Tragoedy was more ancient than the <hi>Thing,</hi> which we now understand by it. I think these Three Points to be clear beyond dispute: if the Reader, after I have produc'd my Proofs, thinks so too, he will, I suppose, have a less Opinion of Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s Learning and Modesty than
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:98199:88"/>
even he has already, and be something nearer toward thinking these Epistles Genuine.</p>
            <p>Let us suppose for the present, that <hi>Thespis</hi> was the Inventer, (or as Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> Empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically speaks) <hi>the First Inventer</hi> of Tragoedy; 'tis plain, <hi>Phalaris</hi> might have the use of the word from him.

So that between the Beginning of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi>'s and the End of <hi>Phalaris</hi>'s Government there are full 44 Years: Time enough in Conscience, for the Word <hi>Tragoedy</hi> to come from <hi>Athens</hi> to <hi>Agrigent!</hi> And <hi>Eusebius</hi>'s <hi>Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicon</hi> allows near as much Room for it, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Rise of Tragoedy at the 47th Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piad, a little after <hi>Solon</hi>'s Archonship. But to take our account at the very lowest, let us suppose that <hi>Thespis</hi>'s first Plays were those that <hi>Solon</hi> saw, towards the Latter End of his Life. <hi>Solon</hi> dy'd at the end of the LIII, or the beginning of the LIV Olympiad <note n="(d)" place="margin">Plut.

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:98199:88"/>
before <hi>Solon</hi>'s death, when <hi>Thespis</hi> is suppos'd by this Low account first to have written; and from thence to the End of <hi>Phalaris</hi>'s Reign there is a space of about 17 Years, for <hi>Phalaris</hi> to hear of <hi>Thespis</hi>'s Tragoedies: for it does not appear, but that those Letters, where the Word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> occurrs, might have been written at the very End of his Tyranny. However, let 'em have been written in the middle, or at the very beginning of it, yet still there will be time enough for <hi>Phalaris</hi> to learn this new word in. That <hi>Pisistratus</hi> seiz'd the Government of <hi>Athens</hi> some Years before <hi>Solon</hi>'s death, Dr. <hi>Bentley,</hi> I dare say, will grant me: that he was turn'd out in, or rather before <hi>Phalaris</hi>'s Reign, he will not I hope deny me; because he has own'd it in Terms, <hi>p.</hi> 41. of his Dissertation. Allowing then that <hi>Solon</hi> and <hi>Thespis</hi> were Cotempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, there can be no doubt, whether <hi>Phalaris</hi> might hear of <hi>Thespis</hi>'s Tragoedies.</p>
            <p>All that can startle us in the case is the Authority of the <hi>Arundel Marble,</hi> which fixes the acting of <hi>Alcestis,</hi> one of <hi>Thespis</hi>'s Plays, as low as the 60th Olympiad. But that all the <hi>Aera's</hi> of that Marble are not rightly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justed, is certain, and Learned Men have prov'd beyond dispute: and if there be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes in it, why may not this be one of 'em? when what is said there is contradicted by such an Universal Concurrence of almost all the History of those times, which we have left? Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> I am sure ought not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist on the Authority of the Marble in this case, because He himself has quitted it in an Instance of the like Nature. <hi>The</hi> Arundelian
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:98199:89"/>
               <hi>Marble indeed</hi> (says he) <hi>differs from all these in the periods of</hi> Gelo <hi>and</hi> Hiero; <hi>which would quite confound all this argumentation from Notes of Time. But either that Chronologer is quite out; or we can safely believe nothing in History.</hi> Dissert. p. 85. The Mistake of the Marble may be in putting <hi>Thespis</hi>'s name instead of <hi>Phrynicus</hi> his Scholar: and <hi>Alcestis</hi> the name of the Play would make one think so, which <hi>Suidas</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly mentions as one of <hi>Phrynicus</hi>'s; but is no where, that I can find, reckon'd among <hi>Thespis</hi>'s. And such a Mistake might easily, I suppose, arise from the Negligence of the Graver, who, when he had gone as far as <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, might throw his Eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Lower Line, where there was an account of <hi>Phrynichus</hi>'s Age, and finding the Word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> there exactly in the same Situation, might think himself right, and go on with the rest that follow'd it: which is a Case that is known often to have happen'd in the copying of MSS; and may the rather be supposd to have happen'd here, because the next <hi>Aera</hi> in the Marble falls as low as Olymp. 67; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which time it is not to be doubted but the <hi>Alcestis</hi> of <hi>Phrynichus</hi> (that <hi>Phrynichus,</hi> who was <hi>Thespis</hi>'s Scholar) was acted.</p>
            <p>But without the help of this Conjecture, and without laying aside the Authority of the Marble, what is said there may possibly be true, and yet <hi>Plutarch</hi>'s and <hi>Laertius</hi>'s ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts be true too, and the Epistles Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine. For some of <hi>Thespis</hi>'s Plays might be acted in <hi>Solon</hi>'s time, that is, about the 53d Olympiad; and yet his <hi>Alcestis</hi> be shown not till about the 60th; which being a Play writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:98199:89"/>
after a great Experience, and when he was in his Maturest Judgment, might be the Best of his Works, for ought I, or Dr. <hi>Bent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> can tell, and That by which he carried the Prize from his Rivals; and the fittest therefore to be taken notice of to Posterity. The Dr. indeed says, it was his <hi>First</hi>; and says it in such a manner, as if the Marble had said it before him: but that is only accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Usual Way of putting History upon us. All the Inconvenience that arises from hence, is, that <hi>Thespis</hi> must then be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to have written Plays at the distance of at least Seven whole Olympiads: and what if he be? there was yet a greater distance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Aristophanes</hi>'s First and his Last Play; even the Interval of Nine entire Olympiads, or 36 Year. And I believe, 'tis much about the same time, since Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> wrote his First Play; and the World has lately had a very convincing Instance, that he is not yet disabl'd. Should Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> pretend 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, that if <hi>Alcestis</hi> were <hi>Thespis</hi>'s <hi>Best</hi> play, it should not be mention'd by <hi>Suidas</hi>; my answer is, that I think it is as improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that <hi>Suidas</hi> should not mention it, if it were his <hi>First:</hi> and therefore I have told him my Opinion before, that it was neither his First, nor Last; but <hi>Phrynichus</hi>'s Play erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neously apply'd to him by the Marble-Graver.</p>
            <p>I have not mention'd <hi>Suidas</hi>'s Testimony about the Age of <hi>Thespis,</hi> because I think it of no manner of Consequence; he being so often and so egregiously out in things of this nature, by the faultiness of the MSS we now
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:98199:90"/>
have of him or the Errors of those Authors which he at a venture transcribes. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, as he stands now, he seems to bring <hi>Thespis</hi> somewhat lower than even the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble may be suppos'd to do; for he says, he flourish'd <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>Tragoedy</hi> at first was nothing but an Hymn to the honour of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> sung by a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Peasants, after their Vintage was over, whilst the Goat lay bleeding upon the Altar. The Company that perform'd this Sacred Song, either alternately, or all together, as it happen'd, were what in Succeeding Times was call'd the <hi>Chorus</hi>; in which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it must be remember'd that the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Tragoedy was laid.

However by this Invention a new Turn was given to Tragoedy, the Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Chorus was lessen'd, and part of it brought into the hands of a single Actor, and something like a <hi>Plot,</hi> or <hi>Fable</hi> was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd. <hi>Aeschylus</hi> improv'd upon this Model, and grew still more upon the Chorus, by adding a Second <note n="*" place="margin">Aeschylus <hi>employ'd some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a Third Actor too, but rarely.</hi>
               </note> Actor, and diversifying the Fable; and <hi>Sophocles</hi> at last compleated the Poem, by the addition of a
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:98199:92"/>
Third. And by this time the Chorus, which was at first Essential to Tragoedy, and did all in it, was grown only an Accessory Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it; and employ'd to relieve the Actors in the same manner that the Actors were at first found out to relieve That. Nay, to see the fate of things, the Chorus, which was anciently the Play it self, now serv'd only to represent the Spectators, and to suggest such Reflections as They, observing what pass'd upon the Stage, were suppos'd to make.</p>
            <p>Tragoedy being now a thing so very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from what it was before, and <hi>Thespis</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made the first Step towards this great Change, it is no Wonder that He should be call'd sometimes the Author of it; that is, the Author of that Sort of Tragoedy, which consisted in Imitation, and a Fable, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusive to the Necessity of a Chorus; and which had now, among the Men of Art, who spake nicely, and reason'd subtilly about things, almost engross'd the Name. I say, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusive of the Necessity of a Chorus: for tho', in remembrance of the first Rise of Tragoedy, and in complyance with the Ceremonies of Religion, the Chorus was still retain'd; yet it came in only by the bye as it were, and the Action, upon which the Play turn'd, was En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire and Perfect without it.</p>
            <p>What was said of Tragoedy then in the Second and more Confin'd Sense of the word, Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> in his great Wisdom and Learning took as said of it at large, and pronounc'd at a venture, that there was no such Thing as Tragoedy before <hi>Thespis</hi>'s time, because there
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:98199:92"/>
was no such thing as that Sort of Tragoedy which <hi>Thespis</hi> invented: which is as if I should say, the <hi>Italians</hi> first found out <hi>Opera's,</hi> a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard Sort of Tragoedy, in these Latter Days; and therefore the <hi>Italians</hi> first found out Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goedy. There is no difference in the case but this, that what the <hi>Italians</hi> did was a Debase<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Tragoedy, whereas <hi>Thespis</hi>'s Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was an Improvement of it; but still Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goedy it self was equally before the Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the One and the Debasement of the other.</p>
            <p>Our Critic was not contented to make but One Mistake on this Point; He has doubled it, by urging also a mistaken Authority for it: for those Verses of <hi>Horace,</hi> which He, out of the Depth of his Reading, produces on this occasion, are far from countenancing his Rash Assertions. At first sight indeed he might think they did; but a Second Thought (and such Thoughts, one of his Greek Proverbs says, are the Best) would have inform'd him, that <hi>Horace</hi> had express'd himself with the utmost Caution in this matter; and distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd Critically between that Sort of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goedy, which was before <hi>Thespis</hi>'s time, and That which <hi>Thespis</hi> himself introduc'd.

It was <hi>Ignotum Genus Tragicae Camaenae,</hi> an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Kind of Tragic Poetry, which <hi>Thespis</hi> found out; and that implys, I think, that there was Another Kind of Tragic Poetry in use before him. And that this is no New

Interpretation of the Words, made to serve a Turn, the Dr. may be satisfied, if he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to consult the Commentators on the place: they are not in Greek indeed, but they speak as Good Sense, as if they were; and some of the Best of 'em give this very account of it.</p>
            <p>Upon this Bottom we can answer for all the unwary Expressions, that may have dropt at any time from the Pens of Old Writers, in relation to <hi>Thespis</hi>; particularly for that Passage in <hi>Plutarch</hi>

                  <hi>In the Life of</hi> Theseus.</note>, that the Acting of Tragoedies was One part of the Funeral Solemnities which the <hi>Athenians</hi> perform'd at the Tomb of <hi>Theseus.</hi>

                  </gap>culus</hi> towards the beginning of this Discourse, where <hi>Homer</hi> is represented as the Author of Epic Poetry, and <hi>Archilochus</hi> of Iambicks, or the Epode: not that they were either of them so, strictly speaking; for <hi>Aristotle</hi> tells us, that there
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:98199:93"/>
were many Epic Poems before <hi>Homer,</hi> tho' they happen'd to be lost; and that <hi>Homer</hi>'s <hi>Margites</hi> was written (interchangably in Heroic and Iambic Verse) long before <hi>Archilochus. Paterculus</hi>'s meaning was, or should have been, that they each of 'em brought the several Sorts of Poetry they practis'd, and which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them were rough and unfinish'd, to such a degree of perfection, as that they justly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd to be call'd the Fathers of 'em. And in This Sense it is that we must understand those Authors, who make <hi>Thespis</hi> the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of Tragoedy; or allow, that they spake inconsiderately, and against the Clear Truth of History. I question not, but some Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of Years hence, <hi>Butler</hi> will be thought the Author of <hi>English Burlesque,</hi> tho' there were many Little things written in that way, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore His <hi>Hudibras:</hi> but He having so far outstripp'd those that wrote before him, and carried that Sort of Verse up to such a Pitch of Excellence, will probably be esteem'd and call'd the Inventer of it; and his Predecessors not be thought worth mentioning or remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring.</p>
            <p>By this time I hope the Reader is satisfied, that Two of the Three points which Dr. <hi>Bent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> has advanc'd on this head, are altogether mistaken; that, allowing <hi>Thespis</hi> to have been the Author of Tragoedy, yet he might have invented it time enough for <hi>Phalaris</hi> to hear of it; and that <hi>Thespis</hi> was not the first, but (to comply with the Dr's manner of speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) the <hi>Second</hi> Inventer of it. His Third Assertion is yet more extravagant, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from all Colour of Truth, than either of
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:98199:94"/>
the former: it will be easie to confute it, if we can but understand it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Neither was the Name of Tragoedy</hi> (says he <note n="*" place="margin">P. 40.</note>) <hi>more ancient than the Thing</hi> — What does he mean? <hi>Names</hi> I thought were invented to signifie <hi>Things</hi>; and that the Things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves therefore must be before the Names by which they are call'd: but he opens himself, — <hi>as sometimes it happens when an Old Word is borrow'd and apply'd to a New Notion.</hi> Right! it sometimes happens that a <hi>Word</hi> is Older than the <hi>Thing</hi> to which it is apply'd; but <hi>Names</hi> can never be before the Things they belong to. But to forgive him This want of Exactness, among a Thousand, I agree per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly with him, that the <hi>Word</hi> Tragoedy was not more ancient than the <hi>Thing</hi>; they were, as he says, <hi>born together,</hi> or at least pretty near one-another: but for that very reason I inferr, that the <hi>Word</hi> Tragoedy was long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Thespis,</hi> because I have prov'd that the <hi>Thing</hi> it self was: and he could not therefore favour my pretensions more, than by allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they were <hi>born together.</hi> However, this Twin-Birth must be understood of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goedy in its first Infant State, as it took its rise from the <hi>Dithyrambicks</hi> of <hi>Bacchus</hi>; for the Name of Tragoedy was undoubtedly more ancient than the Thing, that is <hi>now,</hi> or has generally been for Two thousand Years un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood by it. It cannot reasonably be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion'd, but that those <hi>Bacchic Hymns</hi> they sung in Chorus round their Altars (from whence the Regular Tragoedy came) were call'd by this Name; the Etymology of the word shews that it belong'd to 'em; for whether it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd

            <p>The <hi>Proverbs and Expressions</hi> found in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Authors, are such Slight and Insignificant Objections, that 'tis no piece of Vanity to say, I have effectually remov'd 'em</p>

Every Living Language, like the Perspiring Bodies of Living Creatures, is in perpetual Motion and Alteration; which in Tract of time makes as observable a Change in the Air and Features of a Language, as Age makes in the Lines and Mien of Face.

The same Author

tells us of several born and bred in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, who yet in Process of Time have learnt to speak a different Dialect from that of their Mother-Village.
<hi rend="margQuotes">Why then must Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s Dialect still needs be Doric? and that so tenaciously, that twenty Years living in the Universities and City could not at all alter it in one of that Education <note n="†" place="margin">P. 46.</note>?</hi>
He was part of that time a Library-keeper to a Learned Dean, and afterwards to His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty; a Member of one University, and a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journer in the other; a Chaplain in Ordinary to the King, and a Tutor in Extraordinary to a Young Gentleman:<hi rend="margQuotes"> and could not that Perpetual Negoce and Converse with Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen and Scholars bring his Mouth by degrees to speak a little finer?

               <hi rend="margQuotes">But let us hear a Second Apology that may be made for the Dorism of Dr. <hi>Bent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley:</hi> He may perhaps be defended from the like Practise of others, who being <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doners</hi> born or bred, have repudiated the Vernacular Idiom of the City for that of the Country; as Sir <hi>Roger L'Estrange</hi> in his <hi>Aesop</hi>'s Fables, Sir <hi>Iohn Suckling</hi> in his <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lad,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> in his <hi>Harvest home.</hi>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:98199:100"/>
So that tho' Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> be suppos'd to be a Native of <hi>London,</hi> or bred Liberally, yet here is an Excuse for his quitting the City Language. But I conceive, with submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that this argument is built upon such Instances as are quite aliene from the case of our Dissertator. For Doric might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be proper for Fables, or Ballads, where Brutes, or Peasants are brought in speaking; or for Scotch Songs, and the Chorus of a Comedy, on the account of the Doric Music: but it has not Grace and Majesty enough for the Subject Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> is engag'd in. What affinity then is there between Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s case, and that of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Fables, Ballads, and Comedies? what mighty Motives can Here be for assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming a Foreign Dialect? His Pieces are dated in the midst of <hi>London,</hi> directed to the very next Street, address'd to a Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, about a Controversie in Criticism, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd for the view of men of Literature, and not written to express the humor of the Country, or to entertain men of Low Rank and Character. If any will still ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse the Dr. for Dorizing in these Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, 'tis hard to deny them the glory of being the humblest of his Admirers and Vassals <note n="(a)" place="margin">Disser. <hi>p.</hi> 50, 51.</note>.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The same Apology that is made for the Doric way of speaking may perhaps be urg'd also in favour of that <hi>Mix'd Language</hi> which runs throughout these Dissertations. The Speech of <hi>Alexander Bendo</hi> by the Earl of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,</hi> the Pedant in <hi>Ben Iohnson,</hi> and other Writers of Comedies, do shew, that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:98199:100"/>
of these Reflections, tho' he carries this way of speaking farther than any ever before him did, is not Singular in the Use of it: but this Plea also will admit of a Ready Answer; that tho' this manner of speaking may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for Mountebanks and Pedants, whose bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness it is to appear Learned to the Ignorant, yet that does not justifie the use of it by one, who was reckon'd a Scholar, in a Discourse address'd only to Scholars.

There is still extant a <hi>Letter</hi> of Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s to Dr. <hi>Iohn Mill,</hi> which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd to be Genuine, in which there are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Scraps of Greek intermix'd with La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin; which might give occasion to our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phist to think that a <hi>Cento</hi> of Different Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages was a Characteristic of this Author: but the case of this Epistle is widely different from that of these Dissertations. For the Author of the <hi>Epistle</hi> writing to One who had a particular Value for the Greek Tongue,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:98199:101"/>
shew'd an Excellent Judgment in passing such a Compliment on that Language, as to use it instead of Latin, even where Latin would have done as well. But besides, he had occasion to express himself in Terms of Archness and Waggery, which the Latin Tongue would not come up to. For <hi>Iohannule</hi> was not in use, and therefore <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, or <hi>Little Iacky,</hi> was the only word that could serve to express that in short, which the Latins cannot say but by a Periphrasis. Whereas these <hi>Disser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations</hi> were design'd for the benefit of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Readers, who had as great an Esteem for their own Tongue, as either for Greek, or Latin; and the Uncouth Words here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terspers'd do not add any Beauty to the Style, nor do they convey the Author's thoughts to our Understanding with more Dispatch or Clearness than plain English would do.</p>

<hi rend="margQuotes">It is a very Notable Discovery, and we are much oblig'd to the Author of it: but then there was either a strange Jumping of Good Wits, or the Dissertator is a Sorry Plagia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. What shall we say to this matter?
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:98199:102"/>
Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> had the Character of a man of Probity and Parts, who had neither Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation nor Need to filch the Sayings of Others <note n="(a)" place="margin">P. 33.</note>.</hi>
Those must be unacquainted with his Character, who think he would say in his Own Name what he found said to his Hands. In the Letter to Dr. <hi>Mill</hi> he omits several things very proper to his purpose, <hi>ne sortè qui Me minùs norunt,</hi> Pauli <hi>me</hi> Leopardi <hi>Scrinia compilare existiment</hi> 
               <note n="(b)" place="margin">Ep. <hi>p.</hi> 4.</note>.

<hi rend="margQuotes">This bears hard upon the Author of the Disser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations: but how can we help it? he should have minded his Hitts better, when he was minded to act the Doctor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that Letter to Dr. <hi>Mill</hi> will afford us still greater Conviction that this Dissertation could not be the Genuine Work of Dr. <hi>Bent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley.</hi> For that Letter, in the Page above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd represents Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> proving, that he could not easily be deceiv'd in knowing whether a Greek Verse were ascrib'd to its proper Author: <hi>Nam in his Rebus verba mihi dari haud facilè patior; qui, ut scis, Fragmenta omnium Poetarum Graecorum cum Emendationibus, ac Notis, Grande Opus, edere constitueram: nùnc, ut ajunt,</hi>

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:98199:102"/>
probable, that One who had collected the Fragments of all the Greek Poets, amended them, and wrote Notes upon them, could mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake <hi>Empedocles</hi> for an <hi>Epic Poet?</hi> But I shall not insist upon this; since the Passage pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd carries in it a more Direct and Express Proof that Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> could not write these Dissertations. He had design'd once it seems, to publish his Grand Work, the Fragments of the Greek Poets: but he was now, he tells us, engagd in another way of Life, and must therefore apply himself to another sort of Studies: for that I take to be the Import of the Greek Proverb. Now the Dissertations in dispute bear date after this Declaration; they pretend to be written by <hi>Richard Bentley</hi> Dr. of Divinity, and Chaplain in Ordinary to His Majesty; they would be thought to come into the world some time after his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures were printed in Defence of Religion. He was now therefore engag'd in another Profession; and would not, we may be sure, meddle with a Subject to foreign to the business of a Divine, nor handle it in a manner so ill becoming that Character. He who scrupl'd publishing those Fragments, which might have been of good Use to the Learned, and might some of them have fallen in with Divinity, would much less have taken up with such Thin <hi>Diet,</hi> and mispent so much of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Time upon so fruitless Enquiries as those are which are pursu'd in these several Disser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.
<hi rend="margQuotes">There is another thing, besides a pretty Invention, useful for a Lyar, and that is a Good Memory. We will suppose our Author to have once known something

            <p>The Sophist is not more happy in persona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Dr. <hi>Bentley,</hi> when thro' the whole Course of those Dissertations he represents him as a Fierce and Angry Writer; and One, who when he thinks he has an advantage over another Man, gives him no Quarter. For the Writer of the Epistle to Dr. <hi>Mill,</hi> when he had just occasion to be very Severe on some, who had taken wrong measures in deducing the Etymology of a Greek Word, thus repres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses his Indignation: <hi>Sed nolo aliquid inclementer dicere; non nostrum est</hi>

            <p>Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> is known to have liv'd in the same Age, and at the same Time, that the Edition of <hi>Phalaris,</hi> with which this Sophist is so angry, came out: it appears, from the Editor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s Preface, that the Dr. being then Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary-keeper at <hi>St. Iames's,</hi> deny'd a Common Favour to the Editor, which is complain'd of in that Preface: This doubtless gave occasion to our Sophist to forge these Dissertations in the Dr's name, to show his pretended resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of that Complaint. Now the Dr. him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self could not be ignorant, that this Edition was put forth by Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> whose Name it still bears. But Our Sophist, who liv'd at a greater distance from those Times, supposes it the Joynt-Work of several: he talks of <hi>our Late Editors,</hi> of <hi>those Great Genius's, with whom Learning, that is leaving the World, has taken up her Last Residence</hi>; of <hi>these Annotators,</hi> of our <hi>Ingenious Translators</hi> 
               <note n="(a)" place="margin">Disser. <hi>p.</hi> 66, 71.</note>: whereas these <hi>Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, Genius's, Annotators, Translators,</hi> could not but be known to one that then liv'd, and were known to Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> (as appears by a MS Letter of his to Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> now in being) to be one and the same Person. It is true, that in the Preface to the Edition there are these Expressions, <hi>Quantum scimus,</hi> and <hi>Nostro Labore</hi>; and in the Dedication, <hi>Tuâ ope adjutus,</hi> which might lead our Sophist into a mistake,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:98199:104"/>
that this Edition was the Work of More than One; and that the Person, to whom it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated, had assisted in it: as if it were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual for the Plural Number to be put for the Singular; or as if a Person in that Station could no otherwise assist a Young Gentleman of his College in the Edition of a Book, than by collating Manuscripts, translating the Text, and writing Comments.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> is known to have enjoy'd the advantage of a Public Lecture instituted by the Honourable Mr. <hi>Robert Boyle,</hi> and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of that Post must be suppos'd to have had a due respect for his Name and Family; so that it cannot rationally be presum'd, he would treat a Gentleman, who had the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to be nearly related to that Noble Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, with so much Contempt and Indignity, as is plainly express'd in several parts of that Dissertation.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> did also flourish during the Life of Sir <hi>William Temple,</hi> whilst that Eminent Person was in great Reputation for the Signal and Extraordinary Services he had done for the Protestant Interest, to the English Nation, and to the King who then reign'd; as also for his Learned Writings, which were then in very great Esteem amongst all those who had a true relish for Sound Sense, and Noble Thoughts, express'd with all the Beauty and Force of proper and significant Language. Now tho' the Dr. might without any offence differ in his Sentiments from that Worthy Gentleman, yet it is not credible that a Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, a Courtier, and a Divine would so far break in upon all the Rules of Modesty, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:98199:105"/>
and Civility, as to insult over a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Sir <hi>William</hi>'s Character, and Merit, as an Ignorant and Illiterate Pretender to Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; who <hi>could neither discover the true Time, nor the true Value of his Authors; and whose Choice of</hi> Phalaris <hi>and</hi> Aesop, <hi>as then extant, for two great inimitable Originals, was a piece of Criticism of a peculiar Complexion, and must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from a Singularity of Palate and Iudgment.</hi>

I shall consider 'em with the same In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference that I did his Arguments: for as I never profess'd my self a Patron of <hi>Phalaris,</hi> so neither was it ever in my Thoughts to set up for Exactness in that Dry Sort of Learning. I enter'd upon the Work meerly as an Exercise of my Pen; I saw that Life and Smartness, which I still relish in these Epistles, quite lost in the Loose <hi>Periphrases,</hi> and <hi>plain Country Latin</hi> (as the Dr. calls it) of the former Interpreters. This put me upon trying whether I could express the <hi>Style</hi> as well as the Sense of the Original in another Language; and represent it with such advantage, that They who are no Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Greek might see some faint resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of the Author's Spirit and Genius, in a Translation: in which whether I have been successful, and to what degree, must be left to the different Humors, and Opinions of Readers. I abhorr Vanity, and the more since I have read Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s Book, where I see it makes so unbecoming a Figure: yet This I will be bold to say, that even in those Translations of the Greek Authors, which are esteem'd the Best, would a man of some

knowledge in Criticism exercise all the spite and skill he has that way to find out Mistakes, he might be able to muster up such a Plentiful Number of 'em as would keep my Poor Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and Notes in Countenance. I question not but there are Errors and Oversights enow in my Translation; I was very Young when I did it; and, to confess the Truth, after I had got a little way into it, and made my first Essays, went thro' the Rest of it without any Great Gust: and 'tis no wonder therefore if I should not be awake sometimes in a Work that I was not very fond of.

The Town I own is Weak and Defenceless enough in conscience; but he has had the Judgment to attack it on that side, where perhaps it lies least expos'd.

Were Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> as well acquainted with the Latin of the Great Men in <hi>Augustus</hi>'s Age, as with that of the Pedants in This, he would have another Tast, and another Style: To know the Grammar of a Tongue, and to have a just sense of the Proprieties and Elegancies of it, are two different things; as different almost as Construing <hi>Euclid</hi>'s Words, and being Master of his Demonstrations. Any-body that will take the pains may be Critically exact in the Signification and Syntax of Words; but to enter into the Spirit and Beauty of good writing is an Happiness that None have but those who are Born with it; nor All of them neither: for a Long Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation

               <pb n="222" facs="tcp:98199:116"/>The Reader will think the Controversy runs low when we begin thus to dispute about Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents and Encliticks; and indeed I think so too: but how can I help it? My Excuse must be, that I was oblig'd to engage the Dr. in what way he lik'd best, and had not the Choice of my Own Weapons.</p>
            <p>And now are not These, which I have gone thro', Mighty Blemishes to my Edition? and fit to be insisted on by the Dr, in order to Humble Me and <hi>my Teachers?</hi> He takes care to tell me, that he can produce more Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this kind; I question not but he may: but if he can find out no more Considerable Mistakes than these, I think he may leave off Criticising upon this Subject.</p>
            <p>For my part, I am not much concern'd what the Men of Letters think of my Skill in Languages or Manuscripts: but it concerns Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> to consider what the Men of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity will think of his false and disingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Dealing; what the Men of Modesty and Humility will think of his Lofty Insulting Language; what the Men of Good Nature and Candor will think of his Fierce and Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictive Temper: how the Men of Taste and Breeding will relish his Scurrilous Language, his Frigid Jests, his Low and Clownish Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions; how the Men of Reason and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will approve his Weak and Inconclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Ways of Arguing: it is a mighty Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation upon Him, to have any of these Bad Qualities, or to want any of these Good ones: but it is no Great Blot upon Me, if I should appear not to be exactly well skill'd in the Learned Languages.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="223" facs="tcp:98199:116"/>I was satisfied from some Books lately writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, what a wide difference there is between a Man of Close Arguing, and Rambling Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; and how unnatural a Step it is for an <hi>Amanuensis</hi> to start up a Professor of Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. This indeed made me not expect much from Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> in the Reasoning Way: but when he came to Matters of Pure Criticism, I thought One, who had bent all his Thoughts and Reading that way, One who has now the sole Use and Power of the King's Library, and had for many Years attended upon one of the Greatest Scholars in <hi>Europe</hi>; One that set out with all these Advantages, I thought, might easily have confounded a Young Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that never aim'd at being a Critic in the Greek Tongue, or made the Niceties of it his peculiar Study and Business. But, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult the several Editions, to collate the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscripts, to turn over Dictionaries, nay, and to make 'em; and all this ado, only to find a false Accent, and an Escape in perusing a Manuscript (which I have shewn to be the utmost of the Dr's Atchievement on this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle) seems to Me to savour too much of the Character of those men, who, as he himself makes the Observation, without considering whom it hits, love to make a Noise about Trifles; or (not to wrong him of his Own more Elevated Expression) <hi>to make a Tide and a Flood in a Basin of Water.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nothing has done Learning more disservice among the Sensible part of Mankind, than that indiscreet Value, which Men of Letters oftentimes put upon the most trifling parts of Knowledge; that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in the way
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:98199:117"/>
of Scholarship, of which <hi>Theophrastus</hi> has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us a Character, as it relates to Human Life and Affairs 'Tis this that has brought so ill a Report upon Criticks and Criticism, and sunk extreamly the Value of that Sort of knowledge, which has been of such Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Use to the World when wisely em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd.</p>
            <p>A Good <hi>Critic</hi> is a Name that deserves Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; for it carries in it Probity, Learning, Relish, Good Nature, and Good Sense, with a great many Other very desirable Qualities: but as the Word is now generally employ'd to signifie a Captious, Vain, Opinionative, Half-learn'd, Ill-natur'd Censurer of other Mens Labours, I must confess, I think nothing can be more despicable. Let us stop a while, e'er we take our Leave of this argument, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider their several Characters.</p>
            <p>A Good Critic distinguishes himself always by the Choice of his Subject; it is some Point of Importance, and worth determining: an Ill One is ever busied in things of no manner of Use nor Consequence; and yet is as full of Himself, and his Performances, as if the Commonwealth could not subsist, without 'em.</p>
            <p>A Good Critic is Modest and Decent in his Censures, Candid and Impartial; he treads warily, uses his Judgment much, but distrusts it more: speaks with Respect of those he dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from; never takes a pleasure in insulting over their Mistakes, or lessening their Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. <hi>Isaac Casaubon, Ger. Vossius,</hi> and <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> were all men of this Cast; and so was <hi>Menage</hi> too, till <hi>Baille<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>In his Letter to</hi> Menage <hi>before</hi> Diogenes Laertius.</note> gives of him, is very remarkable, and fit to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd by Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> before he appears agen in the way of Criticism. <hi>Quanta animi modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio! quantus Candor! veram Criticam cum nullius famae dispendio exercere<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nullius Existimationem loedere, nullius Erroribus insultare, nusquam ex Mustaceo Laureolam quaerere; per quos profeccris apertè profiteri; à Viris Doctissimis non, nisi salvo eorum honore, apertè dissentire: ut exclamare cogar, O Iecur verè Criticum sine Splene!</hi> In which also he drew his Own, as well as <hi>Menage</hi>'s Character.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Salmasius</hi> and <hi>Scaliger</hi> had nothing of this in 'em, they were all Gall, and Pride, and Pedantry; which made the Vast Learning they were Masters of sit so ill upon 'em, that the World hated and despis'd 'em, at the same time that it was profiting by 'em: Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> tells us, <hi>There are some now alive whose Fame will one day equal that of the</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Scali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers (or, as it is in his Last Edition, the <hi>Salmasius's</hi>) <hi>and</hi> Grotius's <hi>of other Nations</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>Reflect. upon Anc. and Mod. Learning,</hi> p. 385.</note>. If he had put <hi>Salmasius</hi> into <hi>Grotius's,</hi> and not into <hi>Scaliger</hi>'s Room, I would so far have agreed with him, that there are some now alive, who will inherit Their Fame, as to One great Part of their Character; for they have All their Ill Qualities in Perfection — with but a slight Mixture of any of their Good ones. For my part, were Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> as great a Scholar, as Some say he is, or even as He thinks himself to be, yet I had rather not know the Greek Alphabet, than have his Knowledge and his Manners together: for as
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:98199:118"/>
much as I value Learning, I value Good Sense, and Common Civility more.</p>
            <p>A Good Critic is rich in his own Store; he has a sure Fund of Good Judgment and True Knowledge, which he can trust to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all Occasions, without needing to rifle his Neighbours: but an Ill Critic, who sets up the Trade without a Stock to manage it, must be perpetually upon the Plunder: the great Employment of his <hi>Sagacity</hi> is, to find out Hints in Odd Corners of Books, where 'tis probable no-body else will look for 'em; the chief Exercise of his <hi>Iudging</hi> Talent lies in distinguishing, what Borrow'd Notions he may most safely put off for his Own, and with the least danger of being Discover'd.</p>
            <p>A man of a sound and well-weigh'd Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is afraid always of standing by himself in a New Opinion; but a Smatterer in Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cism is bold, and forward; loves to maintain Paradoxes, and to defie the World. 'Tis enough to make him think a thing true or false, that every-body else has thought the contrary: for he has no way of Distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself, but by being Singular.</p>
            <p>A Critic Really such, always proportions his pains to the difficulty of the matter he is engag'd in, and dwells upon things more or less, as they want more or less to be dwelt on: but a Pretender is constantly improper and impertinent in his Learning; where the Knott of a Dispute is, there You find him very reserv'd and silent; but he lets loose all his Criticisms upon You in plain points, that No-body is in danger of misunderstanding.</p>

            <p>To compleat the Character of a Critic, it is requisite, that he should write well in that Way he pretends to censure, and be a Good Pattern, in order to be thought a Good Judge. The Ancient Criticks were generally so, as <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and <hi>Longinus, Tully,</hi> and <hi>Quintilian:</hi> but <hi>Some now alive</hi> have ventur'd to Criticize upon the Performances of very fine Pens, while they themselves had the worst in the World; and have set up for Judges of Good Writing by a Tast form'd upon the Opinions, and in a Style drawn from the Expressions of Modern Prefaces and Comments.</p>
            <p>'Twere endless to reckon up all the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars that distinguish their Characters; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead on't, take a Reflection or two which Monsieur <hi>St. Euvremont</hi>

               <hi>I have seen</hi> (says he) <hi>of Late Years, Great Criticks in abundance, but few Good Iudges. That Learned Tribe is my Aversion, who are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually busie in restoring corrupted Passages, that when restor'd are at last worth nothing. They set the highest Price on such Knowledge, as one would chuse to be without, and know least of those things which most deserve to be known. Having no fine way of thinking and speaking themselves, they can never enter into the Delicacy of another Man's Thought or Expression. They would succeed very

well in explaining and commenting upon a Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marian; for His mind is thrown into much the same Mould with Theirs, and his Studies have lain the same way; but when they come to one of the Sensible and Wellbred Writers of Antiquity, they neither relish, nor understand him: his Sense and way of Thinking must needs be lock'd up to 'em, 'tis so very different from their Own. In History, they know nothing of Men, or Affairs, they turn all to Chronology; and so they be but able to tell You, what Year Such an One was Consul, they care not whether they are acquainted with his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, or the Great Events that happen'd in his Time.</hi> Cicero <hi>with them goes only for a Maker of</hi> Orations, Caesar <hi>for a Writer of</hi> Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; <hi>the</hi> Consul, <hi>and the</hi> General <hi>are lost to 'em. The Genius that animates their admirable Writings is not felt; the Remarkable and Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Passages there are not observ'd.</hi>

            <p>I beg the Dr's Pardon for leading him into such Writers as <hi>Bruycre,</hi> and <hi>St. Euvremont,</hi> who think well, and speak Justly, and quote little; I know, upon all these Accounts, they are not for his Tast: to oblige him therefore, I will throw in a Little Latin here from the <hi>Preface</hi> of a <hi>Modern Critic</hi>; and I hope it will go down with him the better for the sake of the Place where I find it. <hi>Hic Criticum,</hi> says my Author, <hi>non Poedagogico Fastu tumentem, aut Farragine quâdam Iejunae Eruditionis onustum for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mare aggressus sum, sed non minùs Iudicio quàm Memoriâ suâ utentem; &amp; qui probè cal'e t, quàm pauca penitùs in Veterum Monumentis intelligamus, ideó<expan>

Which Good Measures had Dr. <hi>Bentley,</hi> in his Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Studies and Attempts, vouchsaf'd to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, he had sav'd himself and Me the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of this Public Dispute about <hi>Phalaris</hi>: He had not rashly enter'd the Lists upon an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument which he is by no means a Master of; nor begun an Indiscreet Controversie, without considering where it might End.</p>
            <p>He threatens me and the World with some further Remarks of this kind in <hi>Latin:</hi> I am not, I confess, very apprehensive of that; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, if he had intended to write in that Tongue, it had been proper to have done it at first: for in that Tongue the Reflection, that has given him all this Uneasiness, was written; and in that Tongue therefore one would think it should have been answer'd, and this whole Controversie manag'd. But whatever He may do, I cannot promise him that No other Language will be employ'd against him; nor that the Enquiries of Some, whom he has affronted, will not be extended a little farther than these <hi>Dissertaetions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I was indeed in hopes, when I first put pen to paper, that the Dispute would have lain purely between Us Two, and have been deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by an Appeal to the Learned Men of our Own Nation: but I find the matter is not likely to rest here; Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s Boasts of his Correspondence abroad, and of the Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that from thence have been paid him, have made it necessary to set Him and his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances in as true a Light towards Foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as they do or will appear in here at Home:

particularly to let Monsieur <hi>Spanheim,</hi> and Monsieur <hi>Graevius</hi> know how mistaken they have been in placing their Civilities upon One that does not deserve 'em; and can never be valu'd, but where he is not known.</p>
            <p>If therefore I have not made use of all the Advantages against Dr. <hi>Bentley,</hi> which he has given me, nor display'd Him fully in all his Colours, those Defects, I hope, will soon be supply'd by a Better Hand, that intends to do right to the Subject, and to the Dr's Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, in a Tongue that will last longer, and go further: for since Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> has <hi>appeal'd</hi> to <hi>Foreign Vniversities,</hi> to <hi>Foreign Universities</hi> he must <hi>go.</hi>

               <note n="*" place="margin">Dissert. <hi>p.</hi> 35.</note>. Which Life the Reader now supposes that Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> has read, and found to agree exactly with his own Sentiments; but to his Surprize 'twill ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that the Dr. has neither read it, nor seen it: for in the Next Line he confesses that he <hi>could never meet with it.</hi> So that he finds his Work done to his hands in a Book that he has not yet found: Books Lost, and Books not yet come to his View, are as instructive to Him as any Books in his Study. There is no dealing with such a Profound Scholar as this, who is as well read in what he has not seen, as in what he has. But perhaps here, as in Other cases, he has his accounts at Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Hand: not so neither, he is purely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Conjecture; and <hi>can guess from the great Learning of the Author known to him by his Other Works, that he has in a manner exhausted the Subject.</hi> That is, by his Mathematical Notes upon <hi>Diophantus</hi> he can <hi>guess</hi> what he says upon <hi>Aesop</hi>'s Fables. But, methinks, 'tis a little nicely guess'd, that <hi>Meziriac</hi> has <hi>in a manner exhausted</hi> the Subject: why should not a Man that had written so well upon <hi>Diophan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> have <hi>quite</hi> exhausted it? I begin now to guess something too, and may be able to make out my Guess e're I am a Month Older: I am going into a Country where <hi>Meziriac</hi> is, I suppose, to be had; and when I have seen him, perhaps I shall find, that Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> has
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:98199:121"/>
seen him too — tho' he has forgotten it. For he pretends to present us here <hi>only with such Things as have escap'd the Observation of Others,</hi> and I now know him so well, that I suspect him a Course whenever he sets up for Discoveries. The Business of <hi>Ocellus</hi> has given us One Remarkable Instance of this kind; and this small Piece we are upon will presently, even without the help of <hi>Meziriac,</hi> afford us Another.</p>
            <p>The first of his <hi>few loose Things which he fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies have escap'd the Observation of Others,</hi> is, <hi>that 'tis very uncertain if</hi> (he would say <hi>whether</hi>) Aesop <hi>himself left any Fables behind him in Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</hi> This Hint has I believe escap'd the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of Others: for they that have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd any thing about it have observ'd the contrary. The Phrase of Antiquity is the same when they mention any thing of <hi>Aesop</hi>'s, as it would have been, had they thought <hi>Aesop</hi> really to have wrote it; the Ancients quote him just as they do Other Authors: When <hi>Plato, Aristotle, Plutarch, Galen, The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistius, Gellius</hi> cite any thing from him, 'tis <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>inquit,</hi> &amp;c: and how would they have express'd themselves otherwise, if <hi>Aesop</hi>'s Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings had confessedly lain before them? Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> sure will not be so Captious as to say, that these Forms of Speech are not express enough; among all Authors that quote from others, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, are Equivalent, and us'd indifferently. Bishop <hi>Pearson</hi> has largely prov'd this, in his <hi>Vindiciae Ignatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Par. 1, p. 83.</note>, against <hi>Dailleé,</hi> who laid hold of this C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               <pb n="234" facs="tcp:98199:122"/>
And I the rather referr the Dr. to that Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Work, because <hi>he confesses with some Shame, that he had either never read it, or utterly forgot it</hi>

That Few say in Terms, he was a Writer, is because No-body had any Suspicions to the contrary: and when the Doubt was not started, nor thought of, there was no need to guard against it.

<pb n="235" facs="tcp:98199:122"/>
of that, his best Arguments for this New Point are These that follow.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Old Man in</hi> Aristophanes (says he <note n="*" place="margin">P. 136.</note>) <hi>learnt his Fables in Conversation,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> In which of his Dictionaries does <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie <hi>Conversation?</hi> Or is it necessary, that what was learnt at a <hi>Feast</hi> must be learnt in <hi>Conversation?</hi> might it not be a part of their Festival Entertainments, to have some agreeable Book read to them? and might not <hi>Aesop</hi> sometimes be that Book? If this might be the Case, then the Old man might learn his Fables at a Feast, and yet learn 'em out of a Book too. But suppose he did not, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he learnt 'em in Conversation; what follows from thence? that, because the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of <hi>Aesop</hi> were in every-bodys Mouth, and told at their Meals, by way of entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>therefore</hi> there was no written Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of 'em, they were preserv'd all by Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. If this be Criticising, I am sure, Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising has nothing to do with Reasoning. By the same way of Deduction will I prove, that we have not a <hi>Written Creed</hi> now, nor ever had one: for have not all People from the Rise of Christianity down to this Time learnt it, without the help of a Book? and is it not plain therefore that the Creed is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd by Memory only, and has never been committed to Writing?</p>
            <p>The Dr. produces a Second Passage in <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stophanes,</hi> where one man reproaches anothers Ignorance thus, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>You have not read so much as</hi> Aesop; for so he himself translates it: <hi>from whence,</hi> he says, <hi>one might conclude that</hi> Aesop <hi>wrote his Own Fables.</hi> If
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:98199:123"/>
they were his <hi>Own</hi> Fables, one might pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty safely conclude that he <hi>wrote</hi> 'em; for those <hi>Writings</hi> are the most properly a man's <hi>Own,</hi> which he <hi>writes.</hi> But Dr. <hi>Bentley,</hi> it seems, concludes from this very Passage, (I cannot imagine How) that <hi>Aesop</hi> did not write 'em. Till he tells us by what Wonderful Means he got to this Conclusion, I can say nothing to it. But as for his Occasional and Weighty Debate, whether or no <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> be a Proverbial Saying <hi>spoken of Illiterates</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Dissert. <hi>p.</hi> 136.</note>, I can see no manner of reason why it was brought in here, but meerly for the pleasure of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting <hi>Erasmus</hi> and <hi>Scaliger:</hi> Proverb, or no Proverb, I think, it equally proves, that there were Fables at that time, which went under the Name of <hi>Aesop</hi>; and what advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage can be made of this, must be against Dr. <hi>Bentley.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Closing Argument, that winds these Proofs up into a Demonstration is a Passage in <hi>Plato</hi>'s <hi>Phoedo,</hi> where <hi>Socrates</hi> says, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: <hi>Among the Fables of</hi> Aesop <hi>I had at hand, and remember'd</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">or, <hi>knew to be His,</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>I put those into Verse that first occurr'd to me:</hi> from whence the Dr. shrewdly observes, <hi>that</hi> Socrates <hi>does not say he made use of a Book of Fables</hi>; and from his not saying so would have us believe that there was no such thing as a Book of <hi>Aesop</hi>'s Fables in <hi>Socrates</hi>'s time. <hi>Socrates</hi> was now in Prison, and in obedience to a Divine Admonition thought himself oblig'd to do something in Poetry: he pitch'd upon <hi>Aesop,</hi> putting into Verse such of his Fables as occurr'd to him; and, if we may guess by what we have left of
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:98199:123"/>
his doing, such Fables occurr'd to him as were nearest his Own Cafe. Now what need was there of having recourse to a Written <hi>Aesop</hi> for that which he and every-body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member'd? or what wonder was it, that he had not the Book by him in Prison? why, we are not sure that at the particular point of time, when he did these Fables in Prison, he had so much as <hi>Pen and Ink</hi> allow'd him.</p>
            <p>This is the Irresistible Evidence, with which Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> has taken upon him to confront the Opinion of Two Thousand Years; such Evidence as one would not admit against <hi>Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mias Rhodius,</hi> to rob him of the honour of his <hi>Egg,</hi> or his <hi>Hatchet.</hi> Is it fit, that men should make use of their little Skill in Letters, their Conjectures, their Fancies, their Dreams, to attack the Reputation of our first Masters in good writing? is it grateful with such groundless Suspicions as these to fall upon the Father of Moral Fable, whose happy way of conveying knowledge has been ever spoken of with so much Respect, and been of such standing Use to Mankind? Has Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> sworn to be at defiance, with every man that writes Masterly in his way? Sir <hi>William Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> may be at Ease, he sees he is affronted in Good Company. Let me tell our Critic, what I have heard from Wise Men, that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and Paradoxes are not the true way to a Lasting Reputation; that the first point of Modesty and Sense is, never to Contradict the whole World Needlesly, and the next to that, to be sure never to do it without very good Grounds.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:98199:124"/>The Dr. often gives me an Occasion to put him in mind of this Truth; and more than Once in the very Passage we are upon: where he has laid hold of a Careless Expression in <hi>Laertius</hi> (a Writer of his Own Form) to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose <hi>Plato</hi>'s Account of <hi>Socrates,</hi> or rather <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi>'s Account of himself. <hi>Laertius,</hi> he says, <hi>seems to hint that</hi> Socrates <hi>did but</hi> One <hi>Fable:</hi> and this seeming Shadow of an Hint, even from <hi>Laertius,</hi> is to bear down the Express Authority of <hi>Plato,</hi> who says he did Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>I need no Transition from hence to Dr. <hi>Bent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>; who taking it now for granted, that Aesop <hi>did not write his Own Fables,</hi> will tell us Who wrote 'em for him. <hi>Demetrius Phalereus</hi> he thinks to have been <hi>the first that committed them to Writing</hi>

The Fable he referrs to is that of <hi>the Eagle and the Scarabaeus,</hi> which is in the present Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection; and I think he manifestly quotes a Collection of Fables extant in His Time: I'm sure, had he intended to quote such a Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, he could not have us'd Words that would more plainly have express'd his Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. To return to my point therefore, if there was a <hi>Written Aesop</hi> in <hi>Aristophanes</hi>'s time, then <hi>Demetrius Phalereus</hi> could not be <hi>the First who committed</hi> Aesop<hi>'s Fables to Writing.</hi>

Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> is against 'em. <hi>I wish</hi> (says he) <hi>they were</hi> [the same that are now extant] <hi>for then they would be well writ with some Genius and Spirit</hi>

            <p>I had like here to have overlook'd One Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Branch of the Dr's Discovery, where he informs us, that these Fragments of the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>belong to the</hi> Aesopic <hi>Fables, which,</hi> he says, <hi>have not yet been observ'd that he knows of</hi> 
               <note n="(a)" place="margin">Disser. <hi>p.</hi> 139.</note>. I believe no-body ever read these Fragments, but observ'd it; however they kept their Observation to themselves, because they knew no-body could read 'em without observing it. For to what else could Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Fables written after the manner of
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:98199:126"/>
               <hi>Aesop</hi> belong, but to the <hi>Aesopic</hi> Fables? which Title is known to comprehend not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Fables suppos'd to have been written by <hi>Aesop</hi> himself; but all Others, fram'd after his Model.</p>
            <p>The Reader remembers, that <hi>after Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius</hi> came <hi>Some-body,</hi> who might as well, for any thing we know of his Time, have come <hi>before</hi> him. Now after this <hi>Some-body</hi> comes <hi>One Babrius</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Dissert. <hi>p.</hi> 140.</note>, who has the Advantage indeed of our Last Author in having a Name, and no otherwise: for his Time is equally a Secret to us. <hi>Avienus,</hi> 'tis true, by the Order he has plac'd him in, seems to think he was before <hi>Phoedrus</hi>; but how little, or how long before, no-body can determin. So that this <hi>Babrius,</hi> that liv'd we don't know When, comes after an Author we don't know Who, and equally living we don't know When.</p>
            <p>The Chronology of <hi>Babrius</hi> being thus settl'd, the Dr. proceeds to his Character; and says, he was <hi>a Writer of Size and Quality:</hi> I agree with him in his Meaning, tho' his Wording of it be a little Particular. <hi>Babrius</hi> was indeed, as far as we can guess by the Small Remains we have of him, a very valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Author, and deserv'd to have liv'd as well as <hi>Phoedrus</hi> himself: He has not been lost so long as <hi>Phoedrus</hi> was; may he be recover'd as entire!

I suggest this Thought to the Dr. to enrich his Dissertation with, when he puts it into Latin. After he has done so, Some-body per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may shew him, that 'tis founded on a Mistaken Reading of those two Passages; but till then, I shall leave 'em as I found 'em.</p>
            <p>After these Light Skirmishes, Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> comes at last to his Main Point, pretty early, I thank him; for he is not yet got quite Half way in his Remarks (that should be) upon <hi>Aesop.</hi> He now draws all his Forces against the Present Sett; and his arguments, I find, (making allowance for a few Straglers, which I shall fetch into their Ranks) march in this Order. First he attempts to prove That
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:98199:128"/>
Parcel of the Present Sett which <hi>Nevelet</hi> put out, to be younger than <hi>Aesop</hi> 
               <note n="(a)" place="margin">§ VI.</note>; in the next place, that it is even <hi>recenter than Babrius</hi> 
               <note n="(b)" place="margin">§ VII.</note>: and lastly, that the Other Parcel of 'em, which he ascribes to <hi>Planudes,</hi> is yet Younger than <hi>Nevelet</hi>'s <note n="(c)" place="margin">§ VIII.</note>.</p>
            <p>Upon the First Article he performs very notably; he is to detect the whole CXXXVI to be Spurious: Now would I willingly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound for the Odd XXXVI (if our Critic will give me leave to call an Even Number so); but How Many do You think he has dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd? No less than <hi>One!</hi> and here endeth this Argument.</p>
            <p>Not being able to proceed any farther here, he draws back, and falls once again upon his First Preliminary, that <hi>Aesop wrote no Fables</hi>; which, having now waded deep in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie, he clearly perceives, because the CXCIII<hi rend="sup">d</hi> is told by <hi>Aristotle</hi> differently from what it is in <hi>Aesop,</hi> and in <hi>Lucian</hi> differently from what it is in <hi>Aristotle.</hi> Now here's a Long Chain of desperate Consequences; for if Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> has prov'd any thing, he has prov'd Ten times more than he is aware of. If <hi>Aesop</hi> did not write this Fable, because <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi> gives different Circumstances of it; then neither did <hi>Aristotle</hi> write it, because <hi>Lucian</hi>'s Account of it is as different from His, as His is from <hi>Aesop</hi>'s. Nay, according to Dr. <hi>Bent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> neither has <hi>Lucian</hi> told this Fable, tho' we find it in his Works; because it is otherwise told in our present Sett, which the Dr. sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses written by a Man more Modern than He. All that can be gather'd from the Little Varieties in the same Fable is, that they who
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:98199:128"/>
had occasion to tell it, went no further than their Memory for it, where the Main of the Fable, and as much as was for their Purpose, lay. And as for the Nice Circumstances of it, they either mistook 'em by accident, or thought they could vary 'em for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>This Digression has kindly supply'd the Room of his First Attempt; in the Next, he endeavours at something that is really to his Purpose; and if his Proof were <hi>Full,</hi> and were his <hi>Own,</hi> I for my part should thank him for the Discovery: but as it is neither, I shall take the liberty to shew both That and Him in their Proper Colours, and to do Justice to the Dead whom he has pillag'd.</p>
            <p>His Pretence, and his Words are, that <hi>the Author of the Parcel which was publish'd by</hi> Neve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letus <hi>did nothing else but Epitomize</hi> Babrius, <hi>and put him into Prose</hi> 
               <note n="(a)" place="margin">Disser. <hi>p.</hi> 143.</note>. Granting he didn't, whom are we to thank for this thought? Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> says, Himself; for He <hi>discover'd it</hi> 
               <note n="(b)" place="margin">Ibid. <hi>p.</hi> 142.</note>. But there's an Honest Editor of the Dr's Acquaintance, a Man of a Fair Character, and who has not yet been convicted of any Trick, that puts in for the Discovery: let us hear what he says, and what the Dr. can an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to it.</p>

            <p>The Case between <hi>Nevelet</hi> and Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> is fairly represented in this Dialogue; and if any-body still thinks that the Dr. struck out this Hint purely by his Own <hi>Sagacity,</hi> I'm sure I shall take no further Pains to convince him; but go on to examine, how far the Discovery reaches.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> has instanc'd in <hi>Six</hi> Several Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, in which he finds the Traces of <hi>Babrius</hi>'s Scazons. In the <hi>Two</hi> First he has pretty good Colour for what he says; because <hi>Suidas</hi> has preserv'd Three Scazons of <hi>Babrius,</hi> the Words of which are most of 'em to be found in these Two Fables, and very near in the
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:98199:130"/>
same Order. In the <hi>Four</hi> next he does not go upon so good Grounds; but indulges his Fancy, without having the Authority of <hi>Suidas</hi> to back him in it. He finds out some Words, that will run into Scazons, or Pieces of Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zons; and, without any more ado, concludes from thence, that These were design'd for Scazons, and those Scazons were <hi>Babrius</hi>'s. That the Two first of the Four have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a Poetical Turn I agree with him; particularly the Conclusion of the Second, methinks, is Noble, and not unbecoming <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brius.</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>— <gap reason="foreign">

                  </l>
               </q>
The Rest are so Flat, and so Unmusical, that I can scarce ever think 'em design'd for Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; or if they were, yet I have too great a Regard for <hi>Babrius,</hi> to think 'em His. Others beside <hi>Babrius</hi> might happen to turn a Fable the same way; Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> ought to know, that <hi>Callimachus</hi> did so. As for One of 'em, the CLXV<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> very unluckily pitches upon it, to prove it transpros'd from <hi>Babrius.</hi> It begins in the Prose, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which the Dr. supposes to have been in <hi>Babrius,</hi> thus,

A Good Judge of these things easily perceives, that the First of these Verses has nothing Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious in the Numbers, or Poetical in the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:98199:131"/>
Expression of it; and would conclude there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that this Fable was not taken from <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brius</hi>'s Scazons, tho' he had no other Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of it. But it happens, that Two Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, truly <hi>Babrius</hi>'s, and relating to this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, are preserv'd in <hi>Suidas,</hi> which utterly overthrow Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s Criticism; for the Wording of 'em does not in the least fall in with That of the Prose.

If the Prose Fable had trac'd <hi>Babrius</hi> so nearly in the beginning, it would have carried some Resemblance to him throughout: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in <hi>One</hi> of his <hi>Six</hi> Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> is Evidently mistaken; and must guess again, before he can make up his Number.</p>
            <p>In the mean time I desire the Reader to take notice, that there are in <hi>Suidas</hi> Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Babrius</hi> belonging to above <hi>Twenty</hi> Several Fables; and out of all these Dr. <hi>Bent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> has been able to produce but Two that have the least Agreement with our Prose Sett: the Rest are widely d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fferent in their Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, as appears by comparing 'em with the particular Fables to which they belong; which in most Cases may be done with Certainty. Nay, we have One Entire Fable of <hi>Babrius,</hi> about the <hi>Swallow and Nightingale,</hi> and another Large Fragment of Nine Lines, about <hi>the Priests of Cybele</hi>; and the Fables that answer to these in the Prose are now extant; and are so far from resembling <hi>Babrius</hi>'s Verses, that they have scarce a Word the same with 'em.
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:98199:131"/>
With what Face therefore could Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> pronounce it, <hi>Evidently apparent, that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of these Prose Fables did nothing else but Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomize</hi> Babrius <note n="*" place="margin">P. 143.</note>? 'Twould be full as good a Consequence, should one say; because we find, that Two or Three Fragments of <hi>Ennius,</hi> are with some little Difference plainly inserted into <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Aeneid; <hi>therefore</hi> 'tis <hi>Evident,</hi> that <hi>Virgil</hi> did nothing else but transcribe <hi>Ennius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s way of Arguing, I could easily prove, that all <hi>Nevelet</hi>'s Parcel is trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pros'd, or (as he would call it) <hi>traduc'd</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="margin">P. 147.</note>, not from Old <hi>Babrius</hi>'s Scazons, but the Modern <hi>Gabrias</hi>'s Iambicks.
<hi rend="margQuotes">That they are more Recent than <hi>Gabrias</hi> I discover'd by this means, I observ'd in 'em some Passages that had a Poetical Turn, as in the 173d Fable,

                        </gap>.</l>
                  </q>
This I saw was an Iambic Verse; and (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving first seen it observ'd in <hi>Nevelet</hi>'s Note upon this Fable) I presently suspected that it was taken from <hi>Gabrias,</hi> and was soon confirm'd in my Judgment: for upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting his Version of the Fable, I found this Verse there. Whence it Evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that the Author of this Parcel did nothing else but enlarge upon this Sorry Poet, and put him into Prose.</hi>
I could go on producing Other Instances of the kind, which would make out the Point about <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brias</hi> much more clearly and plainly than Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> has made out His about <hi>Babrius</hi>; but I have a greater regard for my Own, and
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:98199:132"/>
for my Reader's Time, than to throw it away upon such Trifles.</p>
            <p>'Tis so far from being a Mark of Acuteness to point out a few Scazons or Iambicks in the Compass of a Book, that, on the contrary, 'tis hard to find a page of Greek Prose any where without 'em. <hi>Aristotle</hi> has long ago observ'd for the Greek, and <hi>Tully</hi> for the Latin, that those Languages run naturally into this Sort of Metre: and that 'tis difficult even in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Discourse to avoid it <note n="(a)" place="margin">

Nay, to shew how little can be made of such Conjectures as These, I dare undertake to find in these Fables any Sort of Verse that Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> shall pitch upon; and many more Verses of Some Sorts, than the Dr. has produc'd Scazons.

But notwithstanding these near Resemblances of several Sorts of Verse, that are to be met with in our Prose Fables, I am far from think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Fables in which they they are found were written first in Anacreontic, Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaic, or Elegiac Measure, and from thence made Prose; and should any one pretend to prove it from hence, they would engage I think in a Ridiculous Attempt. The Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers of these Fables might accidentally so range their Words as to fall into these Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures; the Best and the Worst Writers often do so, without being aware of it: In Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Temple</hi>'s and Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s English, how many <hi>Blank Verses</hi> are there, which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves never thought of, or intended? and therefore nothing, I say, can be built upon such Vain and Empty Conjectures.</p>
            <p>However, so well satisfied is the Dr. with his Performances of this kind, that he trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantly concludes, <hi>Thus have I prov'd One Half of the Fables that carry the Name of</hi> Aesop <hi>to be a Thousand Years more Recent than He</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="margin">Dissert. <hi>p.</hi> 146.</note>. His Proof, without any manner of Misrepresenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Ridicule, stands thus.</p>
            <p>
               <q>If out of an 136 Fables, <hi>Two,</hi> by leaving out Some, and putting in Other Words, and changing the Order of 'em, look like Two Fragments of <hi>Babrius</hi> preserv'd in <hi>Sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> then 'tis evident that these were trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pros'd from <hi>Babrius:</hi> and if in <hi>Four more</hi> there are some Resemblances of Scazons, of which no Footsteps appear any where else, then these also were transpros'd from Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zons; and those Scazons must be <hi>Babrius</hi>'s: and if the Passages in these <hi>Six</hi> Fables are
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:98199:133"/>
borrow'd from <hi>Babrius,</hi> then the whole Parcel of an 136 (among which these Six chance to be found) are certainly Later than <hi>Babrius:</hi> and if they are Later than <hi>Babrius,</hi> (whose Age we certainly know no more of than that he liv'd before <hi>Avienus</hi>) then they are certainly above a Thousand Years more Recent than <hi>Aesop.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Having by this Subtle Chain of Consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces drawn down the Date of Half the Fables a Thousand Years below <hi>Aesop,</hi> he goes on with the same Clearness and Strength of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to prove the Other Half more Modern than They. <hi>That they are not from</hi> Aesop'<hi>s Own Hand; we may know, he says, from the</hi> LXX<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
               <hi>of</hi> the Serpent and the Crabfish, <hi>which is taken from a</hi> Scolion, <hi>or</hi> Catch, <hi>much older than</hi> Aesop <note n="(a)" place="margin">Disser. <hi>p.</hi> 146.</note> That this <hi>Scolion</hi> is Older than <hi>Aesop,</hi> he has no manner of Authority to say; <hi>Athenaeus,</hi> who cites it, intimates nothing of the Age of it; and if it were Older than <hi>Aesop,</hi> might not <hi>Aesop</hi> take Occasion from it to raise a Fable of his Own? So that the Dr's Proof has these two small Defects, that the bottom on which he goes is a Precarious As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion, and the Inference he draws from thence wild and unreasonable.</p>
            <p>After this, he objects against a New <hi>Beast,</hi> and a New <hi>Bird,</hi> to be met with in our present Sett, which were utterly unknown to all the Ancient Naturalists. As to his <hi>Beast,</hi>

            <p>But whether or no This be the way in which these Words crept into the Text is not worth insisting upon; it seems plain to me that they sprung from some Corruption of it, since they are not to be met with, that I can find, in any other Author, Ancient or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern, or in any Other Fable of <hi>Aesop,</hi> but these Two only.

               </gap>. Dr. <hi>Bentley,</hi> who pretends to such a <hi>Sagacity in the way of Critic,</hi> and talks as if he had consulted all the MSS of <hi>Aesop</hi> upon this occasion, should methinks have observ'd these Various Readings, and have had the Skill to make use of 'em.</p>
            <p>There are yet Two Fables more in this Sett, which the Dr. will prove not to be <hi>Aesop</hi>'s, One, because he finds it word for word al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most in <hi>Apthonius</hi> (he means <hi>Aphthonius</hi>): and it may be <hi>Aphthonius</hi> found it word for word before in <hi>Aesop</hi>; and then we are as we were. The Other, he says, is a Paraphrase on the CCLXXXIV<hi rend="sup">th</hi> in <hi>Neveletus</hi>'s Parcel: and why may not that in <hi>Nevelet</hi> be as well an Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of This?</p>
            <p>Having laid down these Undeniable Premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, he solidly Concludes thus, <hi>This Collection THEREFORE is more Recent than that Other</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Dissert. <hi>p.</hi> 147.</note>. Never was the poor Particle <hi>therefore</hi> so mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serably abus'd; he has mention'd but <hi>Six</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles out of an <hi>Hundred and fifty,</hi> and has given us no tolerable proof that any One of those Six are Modern; and yet in the Strength of what he has done ventures to pronounce the Whole Sett to be so. Either Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> must be a very Thoughtless Writer, or he must hope to meet with very Thoughtless Readers: and such I am sure they must be, if these ways of arguing pass upon 'em.</p>
            <p>What has Our Critic then been doing all this while? he pretends to prove, that the whole <hi>Three hundred Fables are at least a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Years Younger than Aesop</hi>; he has attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Proof particularly but upon <hi>Twelve</hi> of
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:98199:135"/>
them; and that in a very Weak Inconclusive manner. However, should I give him up these <hi>Twelve,</hi> and add <hi>Two hundred</hi> more to the account, and allow all these to have been Later than <hi>Aesop</hi>; yet still there are Enow left, to support Their Pretences, who make <hi>Aesop</hi> an Author, and take Some of these Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles to be Originals of His Composing. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body imagin'd that All, or Half the Fables, that have gone under the Name of <hi>Aesop,</hi> are His; or that Any of 'em almost are in the very same Words and Syllables, that they were in, when they came out of His hands. They have doubtless undergone some more, some less Alterations: but if under all these Changes still the Same Little Story in its Chief Circumstances, and the same Simplicity in telling it; the same Humorous Turn of Thought, and in good measure the same Words too have been preserv'd; there is Enough of <hi>Aesop</hi> left, whereby we may make a true Judgment of his Spirit, and Genius, and manner of Performance. When Dr. <hi>Bent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> shall clearly have made out, either that None of these Fables came from <hi>Aesop</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; or, if they did, yet that in the very Form and Cast of 'em, as well as the Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, they have been since so totally alter'd, that they deserve not to be call'd the Same; it will then be time enough to own<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that we are unable to judge of <hi>Aesop</hi>'s merit by any thing in the Present Collection: but till that is done, we may safely enjoy our Opinions, and They that have admir'd <hi>Aesop,</hi> may ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to go on, and admire him still.</p>

            <p>Thus far I have had leisure to trace the Dr. in <hi>Nevelet</hi>; and I need trace him no farther; for These Hints. which appear to be taken from thence are the only ones that he pretends to build any thing upon. Whatever he has added of his Own (if he has added any thing) has been already shewn to be either a Mistake, or nothing to his Purpose. And now let me put a Grave Question to him; with what Modesty, or Conscience, he could tell his Reader, at the Entrance of this Dissertation, that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to offer such things <hi>only, as had escap'd the Observation of Others?</hi> when 'tis manifest, that, as far as we have hitherto gone in his Remarks (that is in Three Quarters of 'em) he has done nothing but plunder'd <hi>Nevelot.</hi> 'Tis true, as he wittily observes <note n="†" place="margin">Dissert. <hi>p.</hi> 33.</note>, <hi>Good Wits jump</hi> sometimes: however I should think it a pretty Nice matter for the Best Wits in the World to jump so often together, so very evenly!</p>
            <p>What he has put together in the next Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph, concerning the Life and Manners of
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:98199:137"/>
               <hi>Aesop,</hi> with a great Shew of Reading was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready collected to his hand, out of <hi>Eustathius, Plutarch, Agathias, Philostratus, Pliny, Herodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Suidas,</hi> and <hi>Strabo</hi>; and the passages from thence printed at large in the End of <hi>Camera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>'s Fables. Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> presents these to us with the same Pomp and Pleasure, as if he had been the first Producer of 'em; and makes no addition to their Number, but by One Poor Quotation out of the Scholiast on <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stophanes,</hi> and another known passage of <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When he was mentioning <note n="(a)" place="margin">Disser. <hi>p.</hi> 135.</note> 
               <hi>Meziriac, Vavasor,</hi> and <hi>Bayle,</hi> as Men that had gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him on this Subject, it would have been honourably done of him, not to have forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Those, whom he was so much more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to, <hi>Nevelet,</hi> and <hi>Camerarius.</hi> But I find he's asham'd of his Nearest Acquaintances; and, after such Instances of his Ingenuity, I believe his Nearest Acquaintances will be asham'd of Him.</p>
            <p>Our Critic having spent his Small Artillery here and there upon a Fable, without much Success, grows Peevish, and is resolv'd to be reveng'd on the Poor Monk that collected 'em, <hi>Planudes</hi>; who, as much a Monk as he was, never, I believe, gave any man such Gourse Language from his Cell, as he now receives from Court. He is call'd here <hi>an Ideot of a Monk, that has given us a Book</hi> [the Life of <hi>Aesop</hi>] <hi>which perhaps cannot be match'd in any Language for Ignorance and Nonsence</hi> 
               <note n="(b)" place="margin">Ibid. <hi>p.</hi> 147</note>. As for <hi>Planudes</hi> himself, I must confess I have not the Deepest Veneration for his Character;
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:98199:138"/>
but neither can I think so despicably of him, as the Lofty Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> does, because I find him well spoken of by men of Good Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Judgment, and even by his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries Themselves <note n="(a)" place="margin">The Learned Cardinal <hi>Bessario,</hi> in a Treatise he wrote against <hi>Planudes</hi> long after his Death, has this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postrophe to him, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which <hi>Bessario</hi> bestows upon him, is given him also in the Titles of his Manuscript Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. &amp;c.— which shews, that tho' <hi>Planudes</hi> was a <hi>Monk,</hi> yet the Scholars of those Times were far from thinking him an <hi>Ideot.</hi>
               </note>. Nay, Dr. <hi>Bentley,</hi> I think, gives an account of him, not at all to his disadvantage, where he says, that That Sett of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles he put out was <hi>of his own drawing up</hi>; amongst which, there are several so well turn'd, so exactly copled from Nature, and built on such a true knowledge of Human Life and Affairs, that 'tis plain he was neither an <hi>Ideot,</hi> nor a <hi>Monk,</hi> that compos'd 'em. This is an Honour therefore misplac'd on <hi>Planu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> and which he deserves as little as he does that Scurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Language; which the Dr. (ever happy in Inconsistencies) has in that very Page bestow'd upon him. <hi>Nevelet,</hi> and <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasor</hi> were a little too hasty in their Conclusions on this matter, and spake too large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when from some Fables that relish'd of <hi>Planudes</hi>'s Style and Way, they inferr'd that All were of His Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing. Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> has taken up the same In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference from an argument of as little weight:
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:98199:138"/>
the Reason (and the only Reason he gives) for his believing 'em drawn up by <hi>Planudes,</hi> is, that <hi>there is no MS. any where above</hi> 300 <hi>Years old, that has the Fables according to that Copy. No MS! any where!</hi> Very Extensive Words; 'tis pretty difficult to answer for All the Libraries of <hi>Europe:</hi> for, as a Late Critic observes, <hi>Saepe non licet Viris doctis MSS. adire, seu ob Distantiam Locorum, seu ob Praefectorum Bibliothecis invidiam, seu ob alia Impedimenta quae memorare nibil attigit</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Ars Crit. <hi>p.</hi> 172.</note>. <hi>Learned Men are often debarr'd the Vse of MSS, either by their Distance from 'em, or by the Envious Temper of those that have the Custody of 'em; or by some Other Sort of Hindrances</hi> — as for Example, when they expect to have those kind of Favours <hi>gratui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously</hi> done 'em. But supposing he had an Exact Account of All the <hi>Europaean</hi> MSS, yet how does he know, but that there may be one at <hi>Fez?</hi> the most inaccessible Library in the World, next to that at <hi>St. Iames's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was an Assertion fit to be laid down by Dr. <hi>Bentley,</hi> because impossible to be prov'd; and, I believe, not difficult to be disprov'd: for, as much out of the way of those things as I live, I have casually heard of a MS, Older than <hi>Planudes,</hi> that has the Fables according to His Copy; <hi>Vossius</hi>'s MS. I mean, which tho' I have not seen my self, yet better Judges than I am, who have seen it, assure me, that it is about 500 Years Old, and that <hi>Vossius</hi> himself always esteem'd it so. 'Tis now at <hi>Leyden,</hi> I think; and might have been nearer, but for Some-body's management. I need look out for no more Instances; against a Negative, One

is as good as a Thousand. If all the MSS, that have the Fables according to <hi>Planudes</hi>'s Copy were evidently Younger than He, yet we could not from thence certainly collect, that He was the Author of 'em; whereas if One of 'em happens to be Older than He, we may be pretty sure he was not.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Planudes</hi>'s Life of <hi>Aesop,</hi> I can't in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed think it a Book <hi>not to be match'd in any Language for Ignorance and Nonsense</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Dissert. <hi>p.</hi> 147.</note>; because in some Languages I think it may: however I have no Great Opinion of it. There are in it Several Idle Trifling Stories, told in such a Fabulous Way, that one would think <hi>Planudes</hi> meant to suit the Life to the Book which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows; and writ out of his Own Invention for want of Authorities. And yet neither dare I reject every Circumstance of his Account as fictitious, that I do not find confirm'd by El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Authors: he might make use of Books that never came down to us; a great deal of Good History perish'd in the sacking of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi>: or he might from the Same Books which we have now in our hands, take some Hints, which we have not yet observ'd in 'em; and which it would be very Rash and Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest in Us to pronounce not to be there, till we have read over all the Greek Authors care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and sisted 'em throughly. And this is particularly fit to be said to Dr. <hi>Bentley,</hi> who, for want of such a Prudent Distrust of his own Knowledge, has been guilty of a Gross Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake. The Circumstance in <hi>Planudes</hi>'s Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, which he pitches upon to expose, is that of <hi>Aesop</hi>'s <hi>Vgliness.</hi> He had met with a
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:98199:139"/>
Large Collection of Testimonies concerning <hi>Aesop</hi> in <hi>Camerarius</hi>'s Fables; in none of which there was any Hint of his Deformity: and he concluded therefore, that there must and could be none any where else; and that This was certainly a Fiction of <hi>Planudes.</hi> And now how does he insult over the poor <hi>Ignorant Monk</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Dissert. <hi>p.</hi> 149.</note> on this occasion? how unmercifully does he use him? he asks him, <hi>what Revelation he had about</hi> Aesop<hi>'s Deformity? for he must needs learn it,</hi> he says, <hi>by Dream and Vision, and not by Ordinary Methods of Knowledge. He liv'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Two thousand Years after</hi> Aesop; <hi>and in ALL that Tract of TIME there's not ONE SINGLE Author, that has given the LEAST HINT that</hi> Aesop <hi>was Vgly</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="margin">Ibid.</note>. <hi>Casaubon,</hi> or <hi>Gerbard Vossius,</hi> who had either of 'em read Ten times as much as Dr. <hi>Bentley,</hi> would not have talk'd at this rate; because Neither of 'em, as Learned as They were, had read All that was written, or remember'd all they had read. But Dr. <hi>Bentley,</hi> in the strength of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merarius</hi>'s Collections, is positive, that not ONE SINGLE Author before <hi>Planudes</hi>'s time, has given the LEAST HINT of <hi>Aesop</hi>'s Ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness. If he would not be Angry, I would venture, out of my small Stock of Reading to supply him with One, and Him an Author of great Note, <hi>Eustathius</hi>; who in the beginning of his Comment on the <hi>Odysses</hi> (<hi>p.</hi> 17.) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives the word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>. I contend not for the Goodness of the Etymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, let it shift for it self: but it is evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly built on a Supposition that <hi>Aesop</hi> was Ugly;

            <p>'Tis dangerous conversing long with Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>; for I find I have slip'd here, e're I was aware, into his manner of arguing: however, in this I will still differ from him, that I offer these things as slight Guesses on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without laying any manner of Stress up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on 'em. I need 'em not, in order to shew the Dr. his Error, and this is not a place to do justice to the Argument: <hi>Eustathius</hi>'s Single Testimony, without other Help, is sufficient to bring Confusion in our assuming Critic, who challeng'd Me and all the World to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce <hi>One Single</hi> Author before <hi>Planudes,</hi> that had given the <hi>Least Hint</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that <hi>Aesop</hi> was Ugly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vavasor,</hi> who started this thought to him (for This too is one of the Things <hi>that have escap'd the Observation of Others</hi>) mentions it
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:98199:141"/>
with Distrust, and as a Suspicion only; <hi>Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitem,</hi> says he, <hi>Homericum reserebat</hi> Aesopus <hi>oris habitu, &amp; reliquâ facie, nisi &amp; híc quoque imponit</hi> Planudes (<hi>p.</hi> 25). Had Our Critic, when he took the Hint it self from <hi>Vavasor,</hi> taken also his Wary way of proposing it, he might have sav'd himself the Shame of being confuted: but it was a proper Occasion for Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> to be Peremptory, when even a <hi>Iesuit</hi> was Modest.</p>
            <p>The Method he has taken of improving <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasor</hi>'s Suspicion into a Demonstration, is, by running over <hi>Camerarius</hi>'s Testimonies, and shewing, that in None of 'em there is any account of <hi>Aesop</hi>'s Deformity, and that most of 'em are (as he thinks) inconsistent with it. The Learning here is not his Own, but the Logic most certainly is; for I dare say, never any man so reason'd before him. I will give the Reader some account of it, after I have desir'd him to remember, that the Point in Debate between Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> and the World, is, not whether <hi>Aesop</hi> was Ugly to that Degree <hi>Planudes</hi> has merrily represented him to be (No-body was ever Silly enough to imagine it, nor did <hi>Planudes</hi> himself dream of being thus far credited): but the Dispute is, in general, whether <hi>Aesop</hi> were Ugly, or not? Our Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic denies that he was, in Vertue of his Old Argument, <hi>the Silence and Praetermission of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors</hi>; and the Sum of whatever he has said on this occasion comes to thus much.
<hi rend="margQuotes">It does not appear from Ancient Authors, that he was <hi>a Lump of Deformity,</hi> and a <hi>Scarecrow; therefore</hi> it is <hi>certain,</hi> he was not any ways

               <hi>In</hi> Plutarch<hi>'s</hi> Convivium, <hi>No-body,</hi> he says, <hi>drolls on</hi> Aesop<hi>'s Vgly Face, which could hardly have escap'd, if he had such an Ill one</hi> 
               <note n="(b)" place="margin">P. 149.</note>. I own No-body there drolls on <hi>the Mien of his Face</hi> (to use a <hi>Bentleyism</hi>); but the Mien of his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and his Natural Unweildiness, I have shewn to be touch'd on: and their mentioning any One Instance of his Ugliness, is a sure a Sign of his being Ugly, as if they had reckon'd up All. Had <hi>Aesop</hi> been so very Handsome as Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> tells us he was <note n="(c)" place="margin">P. 157.</note>, the <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>But
<q>
                  <hi>Philostratus</hi> has given us in two Books a Description of a Gallery of Pictures, One of which is <hi>Aesop,</hi> with a Chorus of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals about him. There he is represented smiling, and looking toward the Ground in a Posture of Thought, but not a Word of his Deformity; which, were it true, must needs have been touch'd on in an account of a Picture <note n="(d)" place="margin">P. 149, 150.</note>
               </q>
The Dr. imposes upon us; the Picture he mentions is not design'd to represent <hi>Aesop,</hi> but his <hi>Fables</hi>; and by Their Name it is call'd <note n="*" place="margin">

In it, indeed <hi>Aesop</hi> has a Place; and he is so far describ'd there as <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lostratas</hi> had need of him, to express the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his Piece; to have gone farther would have been an Impertinence, utterly inconsistent with <hi>Philostratus</hi>'s Character, who is a Short Writer, and exactly proper in his Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances. His Words are, Aesop <hi>seems there, as
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:98199:142"/>
if he were actually framing a Fable; His Smiling Face, and his Eyes fix'd upon the Earth, declare as much: the Painter knew very well that Fables are the Work only of Easie Minds</hi>

Would the Dr. have had a Particular of <hi>Aesop</hi>'s Deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties inserted here? to what purpose? when in the very mention of his Name they were sufficiently understood; and would have been of no manner of use towards imprinting an Image of that Thoughtful Posture of <hi>Aesop</hi> the Artist chiefly design'd to express.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philostratus</hi>'s Intention was, to describe a Gallery of Pleasure, hung round with fine and delightful Paintings: in his Account of One of these, he had occasion to mention <hi>Aesop,</hi> and with good Judgment omitted those Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars in his Description of him which were neither Taking to the Eye, nor at all Instructive, with relation to his Design in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing him. Dr. <hi>Bentley,</hi> I find, would have been improper enough to have describ'd him <hi>Capape</hi> on this occasion; but <hi>Philostratus,</hi> tho' a Sophist, knew better. There is a Like piece of Address observable in his First Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, where <hi>Vulcan</hi>'s Engagement with <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander,</hi> and his Victory over him is represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of <hi>Homer</hi>; and which, I suppose, he plac'd in the Front of his Book, for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Lemnos,</hi> his Native Island: And for the Honour of That too, and to make his Draught perfectly pleasing, he gives us a <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi>

<pb n="277" facs="tcp:98199:143"/>
as far as this comes to: but he might be Ugly enough for all that; several have been so, that were never made Sayings of: I know Some, at this day, who Write as Uglily as ever <hi>Aesop</hi> Look'd; but their Style is not yet got into a Proverb, tho' perhaps hereafter it may; and therefore This instance I will not insist on.</p>
            <p>Agen, <hi>Aesop,</hi> he tells us, was <hi>Croesus</hi>'s Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador to <hi>Delphi</hi> 
               <note n="(a)" place="margin">Ibid.</note>: he means, that he was sent of an Errand by him <note n="*" place="margin">

But let his Title be as Glorious as the Dr. pleases, his Person might nevertheless be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible; unless the Dr. can prove, that the <hi>Delphians</hi> were as Nice of Temper as the <hi>Turks,</hi> and would pay no Regard to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Minister of a Prince, unless he were Tall and Comely. Whatever <hi>Aesop</hi>'s Person, or his Character were, They shew'd, I am sure, no great Veneration for Either, when they tumbl'd him down their Precipice.</p>
            <p>After all, the Dr's Reasoning upon this Circumstance must be allow'd to be Just; if <hi>Aesop</hi> were Short and Ugly, it is plain, as he pleasantly observes, that he could never make a <hi>Proper</hi> Ambassador.</p>
            <p>There is another Objection drawn from <hi>Aesop</hi>'s being a <hi>Polite Courtier,</hi> and a Man of Address: what if he were? Many, I suppose, have been so, who were no Beauties!

            <p>Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> has yet One Reflection behind in behalf of <hi>Aesop</hi>; he has reserv'd it for the very Last Place in his Book; and we know him to be such a Master in Good Writing, that we may from thence be sure 'tis a fine one.

            <p>But of all things, that which ought most to prevail with us to pronounce him not-Ugly, is, that he was the greatest Lover of Beautiful Persons, and the most Belov'd by 'em of any of his Age: <hi>Alcibiades, Critias, Agatho, Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drus,</hi> and the rest of his Acquaintances, were all remarkably Handsome:

            <p>His Thoughts, his Discourses were all of Love; every thing he said and did tended to inspire people with it; his Philosophy was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Doctrine of Love: and can we think he would have dwelt upon this Passion so much, and inculcated it so often, if He himself had been so very Unlovely and Disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plato,</hi> and <hi>Xenophon,</hi> have wrote Set-apologies for him, wherein they defend him, among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, from the Imputation of corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Youth of <hi>Athens</hi> by Unlawful Love:
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:98199:146"/>
had he been so deform'd, as he is said to be, how could they better have clear'd him of it, than by Urging the Improbability of his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting such Impurities, in which he was so unlikely to prevail? But having said nothing of this kind in his behalf, it must be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd that they had nothing of this kind to say.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aristophanes,</hi> who has expos'd and ridicul'd him upon twenty Other Accounts, has not a word, as I remember, of his Deformity; tho' this was the most Natural Subject for him to exercise his Comical Wit upon, and so Obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that, one would think, he could not have miss'd it.</p>
            <p>I appeal now to any Indifferent Judge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I have not prov'd <hi>Socrates</hi> handsome by as good Arguments at least as our Critic has ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd to prove <hi>Aesop</hi> so? Indeed, they are most of 'em the very same; only urg'd fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and with more strength (if I do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive my self) in the Case of <hi>Socrates,</hi> than our Dissertator has been able to carry 'em in relation to <hi>Aesop.</hi> And yet after all I have said, I freely own, that the Testimony of any Ancient Writer concerning <hi>Socrates</hi>'s Ugli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, tho' it stood Alone, and we had no Other to back it, would weigh more with Me than all these <hi>Negative Authorities.</hi> So weak an Argument is <hi>the Silence and Praetermission of never so many Authors</hi> in a Point where any Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Writer of Note has plainly declar'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and his Account has been generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd and credited by Succeeding Ages.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="283" facs="tcp:98199:146"/>But I offend in dwelling so long on these Trifles, which deserve rather to be Laugh'd at, than Confuted: I will trouble the Reader no further on this Argument than till I have suggested One Observation to him about Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s odd Conduct in relation to <hi>Aesop.</hi> He is extreamly concern'd to have <hi>Aesop</hi> thought Handsome, at the time that he is endeavouring all he can to prove him no Author. He hopes by his Civilities to his Person to atone for the Injuries he does him in his Writings: which is just such a Compliment to <hi>Aesop</hi>'s Memory, as it would be to Sir <hi>William Davenant</hi>'s, should a man, in defiance of Common Fame, pretend to make out, that he had always a Good <hi>Nose</hi> on his Face; but however, he did not write <hi>Gondibert.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Critic's Two Attempts are so very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent, that 'tis hard to imagine why a Man should venture upon both of 'em at once: but Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> had a good Reason for it, they were Both <hi>Paradoxes</hi>; and he cares not What, or Whom he writes for, or against, so he can but advance something which no-body ever ventur'd to maintain before him; and which he is sure always to manage at such a rate, as that No-body will ever take it up after him.</p>
            <p>I have done with what I intended to offer on Either of these Dissertations; and, upon a Review of what I have said, am asham'd to see, to what a Bulk this trifling Dispute has swoln. However, as Large as I have been upon it, I assure the Reader, that, unless I had spar'd Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> very often, I must have been much Larger; for his Absurdities are not yet
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:98199:147"/>
near exhausted. But I am not likely to be the Last whose Pen will be employ'd on this Subject; and 'tis fit therefore that Some Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter should be left for Those that come after me.</p>
            <p>In that Dissertation where I am chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> takes his Leave of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, with Some particular Civilities to Me. He <hi>heartily wishes he could do any Service to that Young Gentleman of great Hopes whose NAME IS SET TO THE EDITION: but he can do him no greater at present, than to remove some Blemishes from the Book that is ASCRIB'D to him; which he desires may be taken aright, to be no disparagement to Himself; but a Reproof only to his Teachers</hi> 
               <note n="(a)" place="margin">Disser. <hi>p.</hi> 68.</note>. I would not willingly be behindhand with the Dr. in any Instance of Courtesie, and therefore, in return, will, e're we part, bestow some Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Advice upon him: the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I have reason to believe, that he has very little Advice from any Other Quarter. If he had, he would certainly never have written on the Subject, in the Manner he has done: for I have not so ill Thoughts of any One Man I know in the World, as to imagin, that he would have advis'd Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> to do as he has done, had His Opinion been ask'd in it. Young as I am therefore, I will take the freedom to do that kind Office to him, which his Friends, I find, either do not care, or are not allow'd to perform.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="285" facs="tcp:98199:147"/>And the first piece of Advice that I will venture to give the Dr. is, that he would know his own Talent; and resolve for the future not to venture upon any way of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that Nature never design'd him for. Wit, and Ridicule, are either the most Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting, or the most Insipid things in the World. I have the Opinion of good Judges, that he has no true Taste of either of these, and performs very untowardly in 'em. He would do wisely therefore to forbear 'em; and so he would, methinks, tho' he should have some little Knack at 'em: for <hi>Grimace,</hi> and <hi>Banter,</hi> and <hi>Quibbles,</hi> even when luckily hit off, are not very suitable to the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a man in Holy Orders. And to give him my opinion what he is fit for, I think, (if he resolves always to be doing something out of his Profession) that the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting Greek <hi>Fragments,</hi> or <hi>Proverbs,</hi> would be a proper Employment for him. He has succeeded well in One of these, and would doubtless be as happy in the Other: for his Genius seems to lye very strongly that way; as one would guess by the Multitude of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs in all Tongues, (English, Latin, and Greek, but chiefly in the Last) of which he has empty'd himself into these Dissertations. And I am the rather apt to think, that such Works as these might thrive in his hands, because the well executing 'em depends chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly on Two Qualities, which he must be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd to possess; Application, and a Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness to be employ'd in such Sorts of Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:98199:148"/>
as only load the Memory, without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the Understanding.</p>
            <p>It is Another piece of Advice I should chuse to give the Dr, that he would, against he writes next, make use of that Relation he has to a Court, so far, as to get a little Good Language, and Good Manners; without which, had he waded through all the Greek <hi>Scholia,</hi> and turn'd over every <hi>Lexicon</hi> extant, he would never write any thing that will either please or last. When he is making Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on Style, it is very proper, I think, that he should be well skill'd, not only in the Tongue he writes <hi>of,</hi> but in That too which he writes <hi>in:</hi> else, he will only make Sport for his Reader, if while he is correcting a Fault in One Language, he himself makes Ten New ones in another.</p>
            <p>And till he understands his Own Tongue a little better than he does, he would do well to forbear Minting any New Words in it; which is the Work of Great Masters, and a Privilege allow'd only to Writers of the First Rate, who know the Compass of a Language, and see thro' all its several Beauties and Blemishes. Sir <hi>William Temple</hi> may say, <hi>Suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency,</hi> and the World will speak after him: Indeed we are convinc'd from some things that have come out a late, that there is such a mixture of Vanity, Indecency, and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, in some Mens Writings, as No One Word in our Tongue would perfectly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer; and there was need of a New one therefore to express it. But if Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>

should take the same Liberty, he would be sure to be oppos'd in it; His <hi>Commentitious,</hi> and <hi>Putid,</hi> and <hi>Vernacular,</hi> and <hi>Negoce,</hi> will be hiss'd off the Stage, as soon as they come on: for the Fine Speakers will never endure that a man should take upon him to coin New Words, who doesn't know how to use the Old ones.</p>
            <p>Another thing I mightily recommend to him, is, that when he next pretends to fix the Age of Greek Words, and Phrases, he would vouchsafe, among his other Greek Books, to read the <hi>Bible:</hi> least he should happen to pronounce Some Modes of Speech to be of Late Date, which are familiarly to be met with in those Sacred Pages. For af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all, should his knowledge in Greek Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning prove never so great, yet it would not redound to his honour as a Divine, to appear well read in all Sorts of Books, but those it best becomes him to be acquainted with, the Old and New Testament.</p>
            <p>I am of Opinion too, that it would not be amiss, if for this Twelvemonth next to come, he read over Dr. <hi>Hody</hi>'s <hi>Vow</hi> once every mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: 'tis a Good One; and those who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to understand Secret History tell us, it was made upon a very Proper Occasion. I will insert it here, both for Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, and Dr. <hi>Hody</hi>'s Honour; who, it must be own'd, has acted up to it always, as a right good-natur'd Man, and an Excellent Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</p>
