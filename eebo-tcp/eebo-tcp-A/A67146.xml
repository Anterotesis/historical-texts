         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>A BRIEF
THEOLOGICAL TREATISE,
Touching that UNLAWFUL
SCOTISH COVENANT,
Which was
In the late ungracious times (with fraud enough,
and force,) obtruded upon the PEOPLE of
ENGLAND.</p>
            <p>WRITTEN FIRST,
Upon Sundry private Occasions, in Prison,
BY
MATTHEW the Lord Bishop of ELY,
After the manner of a Sermon, upon these Words, <q>
                  <bibl>PSALM 44. 18.</bibl> Nor behave our selves frowardly in Thy Covenant.</q>
            </p>
            <p>BUT
Now thought fit to be published by Him, for
the present use of his DIOCESE: The readilyer to prepare all therein, (Divines,
and others,) for that due
<hi>Abrenunciation</hi> of the said COVENANT,
WHICH
They are (out of hand) to make, by vertue of the
ACT for UNIFORMITY.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He words are the last part of that
verse: The whole verse is, <hi>And
though all this be come upon us, yet do
we not forget Thee, nor behave our
selves frowardly in Thy Covenant.</hi> Of
this therefore now we are to treat.</p>
            <p>But no; that we may be more then sure, if more
may be, Pray let's look on it once again. <hi>Yet
do we not forget Thee, nor behave our selves frowardly
in thy Covenant;</hi> So goes our Old Translation,
That's sure. But then, <hi>Yet have we not forgotten
Thee, neither have we dealt falsly in thy Covenant,</hi> our
new Translation goes so; And here is some
difference in words But howsoever these dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
couples, <hi>Have not</hi> and <hi>Do not, Deal</hi> and
<hi>Behave our selves, Frowardly</hi> and <hi>Fasly;</hi> in effect
they come both to one, and so all is the same:
And tis no other, I assure you, in the Latine and
the Greek, and the Hebrew. So that by the
grace of God we are cock sure of the Text it self,
every way.</p>
            <p>And tis well we are, That we have a sufficient
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:95660:4"/>
warrant by that; Otherwise perhaps we might
be to seek, How to bring both ends together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
What? As the times long have gone, to be in a
<hi>Covenant,</hi> and yet not to <hi>behave our selves perversly?</hi>
To have any <hi>Engagement</hi> upon us, and yet not <hi>to
deal falsly?</hi> Out alas, 'tmust be the clean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
As <hi>frowardly</hi> then, as you will: Be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so <hi>perversly,</hi> nay, nothing but <hi>falsly:</hi> And
all the better, because of the <hi>Covenant. Haec est
Lex Adami!</hi> Is it not? God knows, 'tis not to
be denied; This hath been the manner of men
lately, whatsoever is to come of it now.</p>
            <p>Well, If it must be so, So be it: yet 'tis but
hard luck though, to be brought now to an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
reckoning! But who can help that? The
tother might have been helped, when time was.
But <hi>Spiritus spirat, ubi, &amp; quando vult;</hi> And see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Gods Spirit hath set it down so, All we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
balk it, ith' end.</p>
            <p>On we must go therefore, and hear, what the
holy Spirit saith. And the summe of it, if I
apprehend it right, will consist of three particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
One, is presupposed; Another, is now
professed; A third, is after aymed at.</p>
            <p>That in a <hi>Covenant</hi> they were, That's it they
take for granted, and that's the first.</p>
            <p>Next, That in that <hi>Covenant</hi> their Demeanour
ever was without Coven or Collusion; neither
<hi>Falshood,</hi> nor <hi>Perverseness</hi> in the carriage of it; of
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:95660:4"/>
thus much they now make a solemn Profession;
And that's the second.</p>
            <p>Lastly, That God in his good Time will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scue
and deliver them, that's to be inferred here,
and 'tis exprest in the close of the Psalm; And
that's the third.</p>
            <p>Now in the foremost of these will come to be
considered the <hi>Persons;</hi> First, who they are that
pretend to this Covenant, <hi>Nos, We.</hi> And then
with whom this Covenant is, <hi>In Tuo, In Thy Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi>
And that's as much as we shall need. For
the knowing of these <hi>Two</hi> will make the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
it self known. So we shall not be to seek
in that neither.</p>
            <p>The next part will be the harder of the Two;
But yet in that we shall have <hi>Two</hi> chief points to
guid us.</p>
            <p>The first, <hi>Matter of Law,</hi> what it is to be <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,</hi>
to be <hi>false</hi> and <hi>froward</hi> in such a Case: And
therein, no less then the Law it self, yea no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then the Lawgiver, God himself, will be
for our Rule. So we need not fear the frauds
of a bold pleader, to make a nose of wax of it:
Nor the flaunts of a Rude Hackster, to hew out
his own pleasure in it. No: <hi>Annuntiabunt caeli
justitiam ejus; Quoniam Deus Judex ipse,</hi> Psal. 50. 6.
There's our security, That <hi>Ipse,</hi> Tis God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
must be the Judg in it.</p>
            <p>The tother point will be the <hi>Matter of Fact;</hi>
               <pb n="iv" facs="tcp:95660:5"/>
whither <hi>guilty</hi> they, or <hi>not guilty</hi> of such <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versness.</hi>
And the Tryal therein we all know
how it lies: By God and the Country. An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
way surely! though not for some mens
turns.</p>
            <p>Tryal by the Country, in this? How? Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that Evidence, that all the Vicenage will bring
in, Nay, that all the world can give of it. I
warrant you, the Covenant of God shall be no
preface to the first Psalm, shall not be at the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of a <hi>Councel of the ungodly,</hi> (They have learn'd
now to call it <hi>A Councel of War,</hi>) Nor of the common
<hi>Way of Sinners,</hi> (in a paltry pack't <hi>Committee:</hi>)
Nor of the <hi>seat of the scornfull</hi> (their <hi>High Court of
Injustice:</hi>) Else, you might be sure, what would
become of it: Any of their own Fellows should
ne're be a Thief, But who they would, should
be a Grand Malignant, and hurried away to the
Block: And where these rule the rost, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
indeed it should be so, 'Twould not be
<hi>perverse</hi> enough, else: But you see, It will be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise.</p>
            <p>The second part of the Tryal is, By God; And
that, At both his own Barrs: For the present,
first, At that of the Conscience, That's here, The
Common Pleas; In which <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 13. All is <hi>barefaced,</hi> yea <hi>chined down</hi>
the back, an you will; that is, so layed open, so
displayed, that sure we are, there can be no Jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
there.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="v" facs="tcp:95660:5"/>
And there shall be another hereafter, The
great Assizes, At the Kings High Bench, Christ's
own Tribunal: At which all shall appear; All
Persons: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10. and all Things, For all
Books and Records shall be opened: <hi>Apoc.</hi> 10. 12.
And what can be more?</p>
            <p>But that's to come. In the mean while, The
Hope and Assurance is, that God will at last
rouze up himself. [<hi>Up Lord, why sleepest Thou? ver.</hi>
23.] (Their foes indeed made no other Account,
but that they had lulled him fast enough:) And,
that remembring well, what they yet suffer, <hi>Why
forgettest thou our misery? ver.</hi> 24. He will set up
his <hi>Mercy again, and help and deliver them, ver.</hi> 26.
And that's in brief the aim of all this Profession
and Supplication. So you have now the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
of the Text.</p>
            <p>And now of these, That I may be able to speak
and you to hear, to the Discharge of our Duties,
and to the Instruction of our Souls, and all to
the Glory of Almighty God, I am to beseech
and require you all, to joyn with me in Humble
prayer to Him, to the Glorious and Blessed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
for the Assistance of the Holy Spirit unto us,
and for the gift of all Divine Graces upon us.
And that not upon us alone, but upon his Holy
Catholick Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <head>We have not behaved our selves frowardly in thy

               <p>THe Persons are now the first Branch of
our Discourse, <hi>We</hi> and <hi>Thee,</hi> say they, <hi>We
have not,</hi> and <hi>Not in Thy Covenant.</hi> In the
Name of God then, Who are these? who are
<hi>They</hi> that speak this? And who is <hi>He</hi> to whom
they speak it.</p>

               <p>FOr the <hi>Speakers,</hi> whosoever they prove to be,
this you shall find of them, They are the
same all the Psalm through. They very first word
is, <hi>We have heard, vers.</hi> 1. And so it goes on, <hi>We
overthrow our Enemies, vers.</hi> 6. and, <hi>Thou savest Us,
vers.</hi> 8. and, <hi>We make our boast, vers</hi> 9. And there
ends the first part of the Psalm: And that's all
Eucharistical, an oblation of thanks and praise,
for all Blessings, Old and New.</p>
               <p>Then begins the second part of the Psalm;
and that's a Solemn Lamentation, Humbling
themselves lowly under the rod. And still it
holds on in the same Persons, <hi>Thou makest Us to
be a by-word, ver.</hi> 15. and, <hi>Yet We do not forget Thee,
ver.</hi> 18. and, <hi>Thou hast covered Us with the shaow of
Death, ver.</hi> 20. and, <hi>We are counted as sheep to be
slain, ver.</hi> 22.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="vii" facs="tcp:95660:6"/>
And there comes in the last part of the Psalm,
A holy Letany or Supplication, that all of them
make for favour and mercy, <hi>Be not absent from Us
for ever, ver.</hi> 23. and <hi>Why forgettest Thou Our misery?
ver.</hi> 24. and <hi>Our soul is brought low, ver.</hi> 25. and
<hi>Arise and help Us, ver.</hi> 26. But all the way you see,
singing their Praises, or making their Submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
or sending up their Petitions, still it is, <hi>We,</hi>
and <hi>Us,</hi> and <hi>Our,</hi> They are all the same still.</p>
               <p>Very well then. But yet, How shall we find
it, <hi>Who</hi> they are? Surely the Psalm it self,
though they be no where named there, yet has
enough in it, unless I be deceived, to tell us the
name of them: For will you be pleased but to
mark it, that howe're the <hi>Persons</hi> be still the
same, yet now and then the <hi>Number</hi> is changed
for a touch or two, and then they fall in again,
as before: Tis, <hi>Thou art My King O God, ver.</hi> 5.
Not <hi>Our King,</hi> but <hi>My King,</hi> as if it were of One
in the Singular. And tis, <hi>I will not trust in My
Bow, it is not My Sword that shall save Me, ver.</hi> 7.
These are in the Thanksgiving part. And so 'tis
again in the Humiliation part; <hi>We,</hi> and <hi>We,</hi> and
<hi>Our,</hi> and <hi>Us</hi> a great while, and then on a sudden,
<hi>My confusion is daily before Me, and the shame of My
Face hath covered Me, ver.</hi> 16.</p>
               <p>Perceive you nothing then? Oh, tis plain by
this, that the <hi>Church of God</hi> is the Speaker in all
this Psalm, and so it comes to be <hi>We</hi> and <hi>I;</hi> First
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:95660:7"/>
                  <hi>We</hi> in the name of all particular Persons, as so
many Saints and Servants of God, and yet <hi>I,</hi> in
the name of the whole <hi>Corporation,</hi> the <hi>Holy Church:</hi>
As One and All; one Catholick Body, by the
band of the Holy Spirit comprehending them
all.</p>
               <p>And wondrous wisely dealt they in it. They
knew, they should be the welcomer to God for
this: In such a multitude, and yet in such an
Unity, <hi>Ecce quam bonum! Psal.</hi> 133. to be sure God
would never fail them: No, says David, <hi>For
there the Lord had promised his Blessing, ver</hi> 4. But
what talk we of promise? Though that be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for us, yet God counts it too little for Him;
the word therefore indeed is, <hi>Ibi praecepit Dominus;</hi>
God hath commanded his Blessings, all the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
of Life and Goodness, to attend ith' end up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
such sacred Assemblies. This for the Speakers.</p>

               <p>THere's no stop at all then to be made neither
about the t'other Person, <hi>In pacto Tuo,</hi> who
it is, that is spoken to; For the whole address
(we see) is unto <hi>God;</hi> He is named at the very
first; <hi>We have heard with our Ears O God, ver.</hi> 1.
and afterward <hi>He</hi> is spoken to, <hi>as God, ver</hi> 5.
and, as <hi>our God, ver.</hi> 21. and, <hi>as Lord, ver.</hi> 23.
And had He not been named at all, yet it could
be no other. For, to whom the Church makes
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:95660:7"/>
her Prayers; to whom she sends up praises; to
whom she ascribes the guidance of the world;
under whose Hand she humbles her self; upon
whose mercy she relies for help and deliverance;
It can be none but God, God all in all. So
now 'tis the <hi>Church of God</hi> that sayes this; And 'tis
<hi>God</hi> to whom she saith it; And tis the <hi>Covenant
of God</hi> of which she saith it, <hi>Neither have we beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
our selves frowardly in Thy Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If there be any thing then to be stood upon
here, it must be but to find, which of <hi>Gods Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants</hi>
they mean: For God, we shall find, had
more <hi>Covenants</hi> then one; In several Respects, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral

               <p>IN respect of his Providence and the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the whole world: This very natural
course of Day and Night, God himself calls it
<hi>His Covenant of the day, and His Covenant of the night,
Jerem.</hi> 33. 20 We may remember also he calls it
<hi>His Covenant,</hi> the saving of Noah in the Ark,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 18. and That the Earth should never be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
with a Floud any more, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 9.</p>
               <p>From these Generals, come we down to these
in the Text, To the seed of Abraham; And very
that, we shall find, is the <hi>Covenant of God:</hi> First,
That Abraham should have such a seed; Five
several times God terms it <hi>His Covenant, Gen.</hi> 17.
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:95660:8"/>
2, 4. <hi>His everlasting Covenant, ver.</hi> 7. 19, 21.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That this seed should inherit the
Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> that's <hi>His Covenant</hi> too, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.
18. And not to stay there, <hi>These are the Covenants
which He renewed with Isaac, Lev.</hi> 26. 45. and <hi>appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the same to Jacob for a Law, and to Israel for an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Covenant, Psal.</hi> 105. 10.</p>
               <p>But now, if we weigh it well, none of all
these could be <hi>the Covenant</hi> of our Text; for they
were not liable to the <hi>Lies</hi> and distortions of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
men:</hi>
'Twas not in them, in no mans pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
to run counter therein, were they never so
<hi>froward;</hi> no body could set themselves against
those <hi>Covenants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Leaving therefore His Covenants of this sort,
which concerned God's <hi>Power</hi> alone, and His free
conveyance of secular Blessings upon Men; we
must look at that sort of these <hi>Covenants,</hi> that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
God's Worship also, and so had a respect
to the Duties, which God required His <hi>Church</hi>
should perform to Him. It was possible indeed
for Men to be men, and to be <hi>perverse</hi> enough in
these; Of these therefore they must be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
to speak, when they profess on this Fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
That <hi>They have not dealt perversly in His Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I might easily here enlarge again about
the Particulars that were of this kind. For <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants</hi>
he had bound them to, before <hi>Moses</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:95660:8"/>
his Law; To the <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Circumcision,
Gen.</hi> 17. 10. and the not observing of it was the
breach of <hi>Gods Covenant, ver.</hi> 14. The <hi>Sabbath</hi> also
they had before they came at <hi>Horeb, Exod.</hi> 16. 29.
and it alone by it self was <hi>a perpetual Covenant to the
Children of Israel, Exod.</hi> 31. 16.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="subpart">
               <head>Pactum Religionis.</head>
               <p>BUt then at <hi>Sinai,</hi> when the Law came, that
took in all, Sabbath, and Circumcision, and
all other duties; And by this means that, above
all, (especially as comprehending the Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,
which by themselves have the
Title of <hi>His Covenant, Exod.</hi> 34. 28.) carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the Name of the <hi>Covenant of God.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the book of it was called the <hi>Book of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
Exod.</hi> 24. 7. and the very bloud that <hi>Moses</hi>
sprinkled the Book with, call'd <hi>the Blood of the
Covenant, ver.</hi> 8. And their walking contrary to
it was made <hi>the Quarrel of avenging Gods Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
Lev.</hi> 26. 25.</p>
               <p>What shall we need more? I should but
trouble your memories, and tire you out, if I
should draw you here to the several parcels of
<hi>Moses</hi> Law? To shew you, that the <hi>Shewbread</hi> it
self bare that stile of <hi>an everlasting Covenant, Lev</hi> 24.
8. and the very <hi>Salt</hi> of their Sacrifices termed
the <hi>Salt of the Covenant of their God, Lev.</hi> 2. 13. So
was the Priests portion, <hi>A Covenant of Salt for ever
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:95660:9"/>
before the Lord, Numb.</hi> 18. 19. Beside the Additio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
granted to <hi>Phineas</hi> and those after him, <hi>as a
perpetual Covenant, Numb.</hi> 25. 12.</p>
               <p>But all this may be spared; the Point we are
in yet (you know) is but, what they took here
for granted: And having proved, that it is the
<hi>Church of God,</hi> that sayes this, of necessity it must
be granted, That they had the <hi>Right worship of God</hi>
among them, (Other Church there was none
then in the world, and nothing could make it
a <hi>right Church</hi> but that;) They had both the Rule,
and the exercise of the Service of God, as he by
His Law had Covenanted it with them.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="subpart">
               <head>Their Protestation</head>
               <p>ANd in that, <hi>They had no way carried themselves
perversely,</hi> that's now the next Part; And tis the
main Drift of all the Text aymes at, the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station,
that Gods Church here makes.</p>
               <p>Of which this would be noted at first, They
make it not to men; Men by men may be fouly
deceived, But to God himself tis made, <hi>Non in
Tuo,</hi> tis to the Knower of all Hearts, and to the
Judg of all men. As much as to say, Thou O
God knowest that <hi>we lye not,</hi> there hath been <hi>no
falshood, no frowardness in us;</hi> We have been <hi>true in,
and to thy Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So, to that we come now; yet alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring,
that the Sermon now is to us, and
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:95660:9"/>
not to God: Not to tell him, what he knows
so well; But to tell you from him, what he hath
taught us of this matter. That so, If you find
them that say it, <hi>true, By</hi> their Line you may
level your selves: If <hi>wrong,</hi> yet you may see by
them, where and how to mend it.</p>
               <p>For us then, the prime Enquiry will be, For
the <hi>Matter of Law;</hi> That we be not fooled with
Fancies in our Religion, nor led by the nose with
every false Semblance; But that out of the Laws
of God we may be truly informed, what it is to
be <hi>True or false in Gods Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div type="subpart">
               <head>Matter of Law.</head>
               <p>I Pray therefore mark it, <hi>In Gods Covenant,</hi> I say
onely, I do not say in any Covenant: No-tis
out of our Quest that; For, such as the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
may be, The <hi>forwarder</hi> in it, the worse, and
the <hi>frowarder,</hi> the better, the further from mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.
I know they have used a great while to
tell you of a <hi>Solemn League and Covenant,</hi> as though
the Name of that should carry it. Alas, poor
Souls! The Solemner the League is, the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>'s
the more damnable, Unless it be a right, and
a lawfull <hi>Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis not the Name therefore that warrants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing; Nothing more usual then wrong
Names and false Titles; But they must be sure
the thing it self be without exception, if they
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:95660:10"/>
look to have the Name of it without Question.</p>
               <p>Otherwise, Do not we know, that there were
<hi>Covenants with Devils,</hi> such as went for the Gods
of the Heathen! <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 32. And the Prophet
tells us of <hi>a Covenant with Death and Hell. Esa.</hi> 28.
15. And such <hi>Covenants</hi> as these, the <hi>frowarder</hi> in
them, &amp; the further off them, happier man be his
dole, ever. As 'tis in some Diseases, the less yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the better sign, and the more peevish, the
more hope of life: So to fly off from such <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants</hi>
with all the speed we may, is to fly from
Destruction; And the sooner they are broken and
quite abandoned, the sooner is our return back
into <hi>Gods Covenant,</hi> and the safer we by so
much; The shorter our Sin, and the surer our
Salvation.</p>
               <p>Now the word that the Holy Spirit here hath
chosen, comes of <hi>Shakar,</hi> and the Hebrews by
that signifie all manner of <hi>Lying</hi> and <hi>Prevaricati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
Our search therefore here must be, whether
men in the <hi>Covenant of God,</hi> that is, in <hi>their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi>
or in any part of it, carry themselves thwart
and contrary to it, as far as they can make a <hi>lye</hi>
their Refuge, or can shelter their foul Carriage
under any <hi>false pretence</hi> in it. Let it offend no
body this Language, for tis not mine, but the
Prophets own description, <hi>in terminis, Esay.</hi> 28. 15.</p>
               <p>And he has another Question about it also,
that would be a little thought on, <hi>Is there not a
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:95660:10"/>
Lie in my Right Hand?</hi> says he, <hi>Esay</hi> 44. 20. A <hi>lie</hi>
there? What means He by that? Why, because
it was a Jewish Ceremony in their Covenants
and Oathes, to lift up the Right Hand, by that
he expresses his mind; And these <hi>false dealers</hi> in
their <hi>Religion,</hi> He saith, they had so beguiled
themselves, that 'twas not possible for them to
free their Souls. Now God forbid: Why not?
Because they never would think with themselves,
<hi>Is there not a lie in my Right Hand?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>Lie</hi> then to be sure there may be there, that's
once; <hi>Satanas ad dextram,</hi> as <hi>Davids</hi> curse goes,
<hi>Satan at a mans right hand, Psal</hi> 109. 5. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
standing there, not onely to resist the man,
(as he stood by the High Priest, till the Angel
took his room, <hi>Zech.</hi> 3. 1.) but to entice him,
and win him to himself: And wo is me, for such
poor men, so willingly bewitcht by him, as that
they could ever think they did best, when that
they did was but to make good a <hi>lie</hi> for him,
and by making so foul a <hi>lie</hi> in their <hi>Religion,</hi> to
snake hands with the Devil!</p>
               <p>But I am onely now to lay the Law to them:
The Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that appeals here to <hi>God</hi>
against <hi>perverseness in His Covenant,</hi> does it for that,
for a Legal Justification of her self from all <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
(we must use that word which the Spirit
hath used) that is, from Hypocrisie and Dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,
and any false carriage in the practise of
their <hi>Religion.</hi>
                  <pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:95660:11"/>
Now the By-ways of that, they are many; as
many almost as men; For several men have se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
devices, to cloak their maliciousness, ever,
and to put a Vizard of <hi>Godliness</hi> upon all that they
do: <hi>But</hi> we must now hold to the Text onely,
and not lose our selves on the <hi>By.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The High Road-ways, or (as I may say) the
common Church-ways, such as a whole Church
are likely to take for <hi>perverseness in their Covenant
with God,</hi> that is <hi>in their Religion,</hi> are principally
two: Either disclaiming the Old, and pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to another: Or, still pretending to the Old,
and yet practising another.</p>

               <p>'TWas come to that pass in the Ten Tribes,
when after the Calves had been up a while,
<hi>Elias</hi> for evidence of their open <hi>Apostacy,</hi> charges
them with these two particulars, <hi>That they had
thrown down Gods Altars, and had destroyed His Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets:</hi>
And by these He makes his proof ('twas
the Law, that he laid against them,) <hi>That they
had quite forsaken the Covenant of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 19 14.</p>
               <p>He thought indeed, that they had destroyed
not the <hi>Prophets</hi> alone, but the <hi>true Professors</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
all but Himself: Till, <hi>God</hi> told him, No;
He had yet seven thousand among them, that
continued stedfast in His Covenant, do they
what they could. But the generalty indeed was

<hi>Bethel</hi> and <hi>Dan,</hi> 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 12. 29.</p>
               <p>After this, we meet with a dismal Curse also
laid upon <hi>Judah, Esay</hi> 24. 6. And why? <hi>Because
they also had broken the Covenant.</hi> What Covenant?
<hi>The everlasting Covenant</hi> he calls it, yet meaning
that <hi>of their Religion,</hi> which <hi>God</hi> expected they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
should have started from. But how was that?
<hi>By transgressing the Laws,</hi> says he, <hi>and changing the
Ordinances.</hi> The Ordinances indeed they had a
long while preserved; this therefore was down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
now, <hi>Shakar</hi> to some purpose, They of
themselves to change all.</p>
               <p>But then among them of <hi>Judah</hi> also, those few
that were no such Changelings, What became
of them? Oh! <hi>He became a Saviour to them!</hi> For
he bears them that witness, <hi>They were children yet
that would not lie, lo Ieshakar, Esay.</hi> 63. 8. that is, How
ere they sinned else, very grievously, Yet they
would not fail in the main of all, not forgoe the
<hi>Covenant of God;</hi> God therefore is pleased to put
his requital in the same phrase; <hi>Because</hi> He had
promised it at first to <hi>David, lo ashaker,</hi> therefore,

               <head>Hypocrisie.</head>
               <p>THe tother is far the worse, as having the
more danger in it; When they carry
the lye o'that fashion; Pretend nothing but
Zeal for the right <hi>Covenant of God,</hi> and yet pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
nought but villany against it! And that this
is it he principally aymes at, the Psalmist in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
shews, Because withall he moves that Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
<hi>If they do so, shall not God search it out? ver.</hi> 21.</p>
               <p>Yes, to be sure, He will: Carry they it never

light enough in Gods Word to discover their
Hypocrisie, and Law enough there also, unless
God give them Repentance, to cast them all
down into the pit of Hell for it.</p>
               <p>What a notable Precedent for this have ye in
the Prophet <hi>Jeremy?</hi> God foresaw these cunning
tricks in the men of <hi>Judah,</hi> and to be sure to meet
with them i'th'end, He begins with them in it;
He calls to the Prophet to proclaim to them
<hi>Dibre haberith,</hi> the <hi>words of the Covenant, Jer.</hi> 11. 2.
and to lay his Curse upon them that keep it not,
<hi>ver.</hi> 3. That done, He makes him proclaim it
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:95660:12"/>
over again, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. and shew them How He had
plagued their Fathers for not keeping it, <hi>ver.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>How then? Little dream't they, that God
did all this, to discover their Craft: Therefore
they presently (very Holy men!) put on a good
face, and combine most Religiously together,
And now All as One man, They are for <hi>the
Covenant,</hi> yea mary are they; So that the Prophet
himself (a man rightly meaning) thought, all
would have been well.</p>
               <p>But then he presently tells us, God call'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
unto Him, and told Him, They deceived
Him, what ere they pretended, this of theirs
was none of <hi>His Covenant,</hi> 'Twas all but <hi>Kesher,</hi>
this, <hi>vers.</hi> 9. A strong Conspiracy between the
Two Houses. They had indeed now subtilly
made a Solemn League between those two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes;
But the Rebellion was the greater for
that, Because it carried away the poor people
of God with that pretence; And thereby <hi>His
Covenant,</hi> the right <hi>and true Covenant of God,</hi> was
the more foully broken by them, <hi>vers.</hi> 10. So
that <hi>He</hi> flatly commands the Prophet, (and that
not once, but twice) <hi>Not so much as once to pray for
them, vers.</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>And how think you of this now? But this is
onely to shew, how such Cases stand in Law;
That's our Point; And here God himself was
the Judge in it, the Prophet makes but the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
<pb n="xx" facs="tcp:95660:13"/>
of it: But it comes home so close to us, that
I doubt, all the cunning 'twixt <hi>Orkney</hi> and <hi>Silley</hi>
will be able to make no other Issue in it.</p>
               <p>For if they think to tell us, There indeed it
could be other then so, not but a shameful <hi>Lie,</hi>
and a very damnable Case, because all their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiring
then was in truth, to promote the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of <hi>Baal vers.</hi> 17. But how can that be the
Case now among us? Alas, how easily is this
put by? For, in competition with <hi>the Covenant
of God,</hi> every thing that is not it, is <hi>Baal;</hi> Let
them call it the <hi>Covenant,</hi> as much as they will,
An <hi>Ingagement,</hi> or what they will nick-name it;
yet 'tis an Idol; and all the Worship they give it,
is flat Idolatry; no better then the <hi>Worshipping of
Baal:</hi> For why? Is it not set up against God?
Does it not shoulder His Covenant? sits cheek
by joll with it? Yea, 'tis the thing, that's alone
and principally intended by them: So they make
a very <hi>Baal</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>Let me tell them therefore, there are in the
World more <hi>Baal,</hi> then one; An 'twere but a
wisp, yet when they joyn it with that which
belongs unto God, and couple it with <hi>His Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi>
Their God they make it, 'tis a <hi>Baal</hi> to
them. It is not for nothing therefore, that the
Scripture so often makes that word Plural; We
are told of <hi>leaving God, and serving Baalim, Judg</hi>
2. 11. that is, Any thing else (that's in Divine
<pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:95660:13"/>
esteem with men) but God; Any thing by them
set up with God, To them, that's their <hi>Baal,</hi> a
privy Idol in their budget: So, that d'off will
no way help them.</p>
               <p>Of all the rest not in this matter of <hi>Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi>
For howsoever they have gone to work
too now, to make a wretched People willing
to be cheated by them; let me give them this
gift, The first Idolatry, that the People of God
ever committed with any <hi>Baal,</hi> was in reference
to a <hi>Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And how say you then? Does this suit right?
Take another. The first <hi>Covenant</hi> that ever <hi>Gods</hi>
People made (of their own heads, without Gods
Deputy to lead them,) was a <hi>Covenant with Baal.</hi>
And now I hope they will thank me, for I am
come close home to them.</p>
               <p>But I will not fail to make it good; For the
Word of <hi>God</hi> is express in it: <hi>When Gideon was
dead, they went a whoring after Baalim, and made
Baal Berith their God Judg.</hi> 8. 33. <hi>Baal Berith a God?</hi>
Now a' Gods name, what's that? Why in plain
English, 'tis the <hi>Idol of a Covenant;</hi> so <hi>Berith</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies.
So that for all brave <hi>Covenanters</hi> here you
see, <hi>Baal</hi> is their Chief, The very first that e're
twang'd that way, to be entertain'd by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and to Covenant with them.</p>
               <p>And yet for the while then, who but He?
Lord! such a Racket! In all hast there must be
<pb n="xxii" facs="tcp:95660:14"/>
an House made for Him (a Temple forsooth,
for a God) by the wise Lords of <hi>Sichem, Judg.</hi>
9. 4. And there he must have his Exchequer, to
receive what came in upon the Publick Faith:
And then presently upon that score, brave and
jolly men, they make themselves, no less then
King-makers, and out of their Treasury, they
assign him an Allowance of Seventy pieces of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
for the States service. What to do? A Holy
Work, you may be sure: To hire vagring Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains,
to go and murther seventy of his Fathers
Sons, that He onely may be their King, <hi>ver.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>And for a few years this held on bravely; Till
at last, God in Vengeance upon them all, sent
an Evil Spirit between Him and his Makers, His
great Masters: And what was the Issue? First,
He destroyed Them and their City, <hi>ver.</hi> 45. and
at once burnt the House of their <hi>God Berith,</hi> as
great a God as he was, He and his Covenant
went to the Fire, (who but their new General
against it more then any?) and a Thousand of
the chief Covenanters roasted together with it,
<hi>vers.</hi> 49. And within a while after, this King of
theirs had his own brains beaten out, <hi>vers.</hi> 53.
and yet as short a time as he had, to make it
more remarkable, he murthered himself also, by
making his own Man to be his Murtherer, <hi>vers.</hi>
54 This is the Account, which the Spirit of God
gives you of <hi>that Solemn League and Covenant,</hi> the
first of the kind!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="xxiii" facs="tcp:95660:14"/>
The Result whereof is this, That in point of
<hi>Law</hi> the word it self works just nothing: To
talk therefore now of <hi>a Covenant,</hi> and to look,
that alone should do it, alas, 'tis but a poor piece
of Sophistry; none but S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Galatians will
be bewitch't by the bare Name of it; For sacred
it may be, and it may be abominable. Do you
not see, how the Holy Spirit used it, even when
the Name of God is joyned to it? mentioning
the <hi>Covenant of God,</hi> He meant the <hi>true God;</hi> But
yet naming it so, <hi>The God</hi> of their <hi>Covenant,</hi> He
meant a Filthy Idol.</p>
               <p>Will you any more? Is not, I pray, the same
term of <hi>Covenanting</hi> given in Scripture to the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest
of all Gods Enemies? <hi>The Edomites and Isma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites,
the Moabites and Hagarens; Gebal, and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
and Amalek, the Philistins, with them that dwell
at Tyre; Assur also is joyned unto them.</hi> A desperate
Crew! Rake all the world, and not find a worse!
And now what of them? As we read it, it is,
<hi>They have cast their Heads together and are confederate
against Thee. Psal.</hi> 83. 5. <hi>Confederate!</hi> A word ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
unadvisedly (by their good leaves) here u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
Else, why was it then at the Reformation,
turn'd out of Latin? Confederate is meerly La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine.</p>
               <p>But this very <hi>Berith</hi> is the word in the Psalm,
<hi>They have all entered into a Covenant against Thee.</hi>
You see therefore, what a goodly race of <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters</hi>
                  <pb n="xxiv" facs="tcp:95660:15"/>
then there was, and of what Date they
originally be. And this above all, <hi>Baal Beri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans</hi>
they were all, The Servants of <hi>Baalim,</hi> of
<hi>Idols and Devils;</hi> All in a <hi>solemn Covenant</hi> against
the <hi>true God:</hi> And therefore the Spirit of God
would not omit, there to set down their proper
Motto also, The Sum of their Resolution what
it was, <hi>Let us take to our selves the Houses of God in
possession, vers.</hi> 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>Well then, The <hi>Law</hi> proving to be this, That
<hi>Covenant</hi> there is none justifiable and good, with
no Person, no People, no Nations, that is ever
warrantable, unless we can truly tell God the
<hi>Covenant is His,</hi> that it is <hi>Pactum Tuum,</hi> such as is
in a fair Order to Him, for the true Drift of it,
and for the chief right in it, and such, as He
will surely own it,</p>
               <p>Therefore, to put upon Him that, that's none
of <hi>His;</hi> Or under pretence of His better Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and purer Service, to combine for ought,
that's quite contrary to His Will, But onely,
because they say it is <hi>His,</hi> they will force it upon
others, so to be taken, and so to be done, That
this is <hi>Sheker</hi> in every degree of it, very <hi>Froward,
Lying, and false dealing with God, a perverse</hi> and
wicked course in all of them, opposite (less or
more) to the <hi>true Covenant of God,</hi> and that the
Vengeance of God will at last seize on all, that
have any hand in it,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="xxv" facs="tcp:95660:15"/>
The Tryal will now be no long labour; to
find, for <hi>Matter of Fact,</hi> Whether their Plea here
in the Psalm be true or no: Whither they for
any <hi>froward carriage toward the Covenant of their God,</hi>
will be found to stand <hi>Not Guilty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it will be a longer business though, then
we can hope to end it, before the usual limitation
of our Hour be ended. For be the <hi>Evidence,</hi>
that will be brought, never so clear, yet they
must have Time to hear it all, and liberty to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,
what they can against it; They must also
be heard at large, What they have to say for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
God forbid else.</p>
               <p>For any man to be accused, and he cannot tell
by whom; To be impeached, and he knows not
of what; Condemned, and he never heard Why,
nor ever was heard, what he could say; If there
be any Law to warrant such proceedings, it must
be fetcht out of <hi>Scythia;</hi> If any Religion can suit
with it, 'tis onely that of the <hi>Sichemites</hi> God, ycle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
<hi>Baal Berith, The Lord of the New Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By your good leaves therefore, we will not
huddle it, nor shall our Defendants in the Text
be pinch't at all in Time; Here therefore wee'l
now <hi>adjourn,</hi> till God give the next leisure.</p>

            <head>The Second PART.</head>
            <head>Nor behaved our selves frowardly in
Thy Covenant.</head>
            <p>HEre's one thing supposed in this Text;
That <hi>Covenanters</hi> these men were, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
in a <hi>Covenant</hi> with Him whom
they treat with.</p>
            <p>And within the Verge of that, there are three
particulars. First, that 'tis the Church of the
<hi>Jews</hi> that are the Persons now treating. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
That <hi>God</hi> Himself is the Person to whom they
make this Address: And lastly, That the Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is to clear themselves, as to <hi>His Covenant,</hi>
from <hi>frowardness, perverseness, and Lying</hi> in all
their Deportment.</p>
            <p>And all this, by the Blessing of God, hath been
formerly unfolded by us.</p>
            <p>We then fell upon a Distinction also, as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Gods Covenant.</hi> That here is not meant the
Providential parts thereof; At first, provided
for <hi>Adam,</hi> in Gods Blessings of Nature, by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution
of the Day and the Night; Nor the
second, vouchsafed to <hi>Noah,</hi> for the worlds secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
against any new Deluge; Nor yet a third,
by His Blessings upon <hi>Abraham,</hi> to give him an
<pb n="xxvii" facs="tcp:95660:16"/>
Holy feed, and so continued to <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> to
settle that Seed in the Land of Promise.</p>
            <p>None of these proved to be <hi>Gods Covenant</hi> here
in the Text. But 'tis the Conditional part of it
that they now aim at; At the <hi>Rule,</hi> that God of
old had prescribed to them, for the <hi>worshipping of
Him as God,</hi> and at those Duties, that they were
by <hi>His Covenant</hi> bound to, for the observing of
His Holy Law: The general Heads whereof we
found to be these two, <hi>Their Religion,</hi> and <hi>their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So there came in their Protestation (and that's
made to God himself,) of their Integrity, That
they were all <hi>true men to this Covenant,</hi> ever had
been, and still were forward and ready and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
in their Duties, free from all <hi>untowardness
and frowardness,</hi> from <hi>all perverseness, lying, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling,</hi>
in the whole managery of it.</p>
            <p>So, that then led us necessarily to go and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
the Point a while; And first, For <hi>Matter of
Law,</hi> To define, what it is to be <hi>false in Gods Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And by that we found, That the bare Name of
a Covenant works nothing, but that the solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
a League is, the more damnable the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
may be, and so may oblige men the straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier
to a speedy breaking of it, and to an utter
abandoning of it.</p>
            <p>The Matter therefore of the <hi>Covenant</hi> was one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="xxviii" facs="tcp:95660:17"/>
to be looked to, to see, VVhither they did
not, either disclaim the old One, (the true one)
and pretend to another; Or if not so palpably
cross, yet (which has more danger in it;) VVhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
pretending still to the old, they did not pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
another.</p>
            <p>For if so, if either of these, then <hi>by the Law,</hi>
that proved an <hi>Abominable Lie,</hi> no less then the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up of an <hi>Idol,</hi> 'twas the <hi>Worshipping of Baal
more then God.</hi> And this was at large exemplified
by their <hi>Baal Berith, the God</hi> (forsooth) of <hi>their
Covenant;</hi> That proved to be the first Idolatry
that ever Gods People committed with any <hi>Baal;</hi>
And so, the first <hi>Covenant</hi> that the People took
upon them to bring in, was a <hi>Covenant with Baal,</hi>
which the more they termed it <hi>Gods Covenant,</hi> the
fouler was the <hi>Lie,</hi> and the fiercer it'h end was
the Vengeance of God upon it.</p>
            <p>And thus far now, we went before. But then
being come to the next Point, The <hi>Matter of Fact,</hi>
to examine their Plea of <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> and finding
that, a larger business by far, then the Time would
then admit, there we <hi>adjourned.</hi> Therefore now
by gods Providence being brought upon it again,
there we are now to set in anew, and so to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in it, as God shall enable us.</p>
            <p>Joyn you therefore with me, I beseech you, in
Humble Prayer to Him for His blessed As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <div type="subpart">

               <head>Nor behave our selves frowardly, &amp;c.</head>
               <p>WE are now to suppose the <hi>Court</hi> set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
That of our Conscience, first;
And now let's but see, how the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
comes trowling in.</p>
               <p>First, False Rumours raised; Scandals divul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged;
Jealousies fomented; Gods Anointed in his
Footsteps standered.</p>
               <p>Then, Routs approved of; Arms taken up;
VVars levied; Gods VVord rejected; Gods
Sword resisted.</p>
               <p>After that, Mens properties invaded; their
Persons destroyed; The Lords Vineyard rooted
up; All Rights baffled; Laws supprest; The
Ordinances all changed. To go no higher yet
then this; Though this be far the least part of
the publick outrages rushing in with a <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then for a Personal Charge upon Men. Such
a one (not to name him now; though who
knows not many thousand such Ones?) That
he might share in the booty, and patch up a
mean Fortune in a few Moneths: Another, That
he might save his own stake, and be out of the
lash of the Common Scourge: A third, That he
might curry but favour enough, to get a little
Release of the Curses upon him, To comply
<pb n="xxx" facs="tcp:95660:18"/>
with the Times, and run along as the stream
goes, [As our Psalmist elsewhere has it, <hi>With the
froward to learn frowardness, Psal.</hi> 18. But their
Guides from <hi>Rome,</hi> I understand, could play the
good Fellows, and make a case of Conscience of
it, and termed it, submitting to the present Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
under whose Protection they lived;]
All this, and more, abundantly proved, And
yet now in a Tryal of <hi>Frowardness,</hi> will it be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
for such <hi>Covenant-mongers</hi> not to be found
<hi>Guilty?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But for a Defence in their <hi>Covenant,</hi> we must
not but hear, what Plea they would use. For
they alledge, That they had <hi>good Law</hi> for that they
did: Have they not clear Precedents from Gods
People of old, as so many <hi>ruled Cases,</hi> practised
by Them, and never reproved by God? Well
then, Christians therefore now are to do the like,
for the due preserving of their Religion.</p>
               <p>And somewhat of this they say, hath truth
enough in it; There are store of Examples from
Time to time in Scripture, of the <hi>Covenant of God</hi>
renewed among His People. But then I must
tell them, Such Examples they are all, every one
of them, as if the Proceedings of our Times
be applied to them, there shall need no other
Judgment. 'Twill prove as vast a difference, and
as vile, set them once together, as is the Picture
of a Dog to the Image of a Man; Can they not
<pb n="xxxi" facs="tcp:95660:18"/>
relish this? Then, as is the shape of a foul Fiend
to the Pourtraiture of a Blessed Angel.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="subpart">
               <head>1. Nothing added to Gods Covenant.</head>
               <p>This for First, That from the first to the last,
there's nothing <hi>Covenanted for in Scripture,</hi> but what
was ordain'd for them from the beginning;
From the beginning of their Law, which God
gave them in <hi>Horeb,</hi> That was for his <hi>Worship,</hi>
and all relating thereunto; and from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of their Kingdom, unto which God had
after brought them, That was for the whole Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Government; But 'twas one and the same
<hi>Covenant</hi> still; None but the first, No new tricks,
foisted in at pleasure with the very Ordinance of
God, upon any specious pretences whatsoever.</p>
               <p>Onely there's one Story indeed; If they mean
that for their Pattern, worth our looking at it.
It was of the new Samaritans, that were placed
in the Room of the Captivated Israelites; The
Lyons had taught them to be very godly, and so
they got them a Priest, and of him they learned,
<hi>how they should fear the Lord,</hi> 2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 17. 18. This
was very well, was it not? Arrant Assirians of
a sudden to become so very holy? And how then?
<hi>So they feared the Lord,</hi> sayes that Text, <hi>ver.</hi> 32. That
is, They used the <hi>right worship of the true God.</hi> But
how though did they it? Here comes in the point.</p>
               <p>Not without tricks enough of their own, with
<pb n="xxxii" facs="tcp:95660:19"/>
it, First, They themselves became Priest-makers:
And next, 'Twas no matter Who, the meanest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them would serve, and was set up to do the
Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>Well: Yet once again the Text there strikes
upon the former string, and tells<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> us, that <hi>They
worshipped the Lord, ver.</hi> 33. Did they so? And
what would we more? Nothing: Did it not
tells us withal, that there was more; For they
<hi>served their own Gods</hi> too. Oh, is that it? Tis
plain therefore the Holy Ghost hath set it down
this, but by way of an Irony, as an Holy Scoffe
upon them, Excellent <hi>worshippers of God</hi> these,
That <hi>worship Him, How they list,</hi> and <hi>whom they list
with Him!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So for a Conclusion in the verse follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the Holy Spirit deals plain and down
right with them. <hi>They feared not the Lord, ver.</hi> 34.
But is not this strange? Twice afore <hi>They feared
the Lord,</hi> and now flatly, <hi>They feared not the Lord.</hi>
How must this be unriddled? Tis done to our
hands; The Reason follows there. <hi>Because they
did it not, According to the Statutes, and Ordinances,
and Law, that God had commanded at first,</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the <hi>Right Covenant, ver.</hi> 38, they had thrust
in what pleased them, into the new Model of
their Religion. And you see how well God
likes of that.</p>
               <p>And that's the first Exception here, A <hi>Covenant</hi>
                  <pb n="xxxiii" facs="tcp:95660:19"/>
for <hi>the Religion</hi> loudly cried up, but yet suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
powdered with Additionals, of Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
Perjury, Violence, Treason, Rebellion;
And yet still must go for the <hi>Covenant of God.</hi>
Find they any such medlies in Scripture, but of
their good Brethren, the Samaritans?</p>
               <p>The sway of this Point therefore still lies in
<hi>Tuo.</hi> For <hi>Tuum</hi> it cannot, it will not be, none
of <hi>Gods Covenant,</hi> lift they their hands ne're so
high, unless the Contents of it be taken out of
His will alone, He the onely Author and Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of it, and no Compeers with Him (North,
or South) in it to mingle their good pleasures
with it.</p>
               <p>The Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> also implies as much.
Other words there are that do indifferently signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
Agreements, and Compacts, Leagues also,
and Conspiracies. But <hi>Berith</hi> is never construed

                  </gap>. The New Testament,
and the Old Testament bear no other Name but
that. And therefore it is not <hi>Tuum,</hi> unless it
may stand for <hi>Testamentum</hi> also. 'Tis none of that
which is rightly called <hi>Gods Covenant, Psal.</hi> 105. 9.
unless it may be added, that 'tis <hi>His Law, and His

               <p>YEt there's a second Exception, worse then the

is this.</p>
               <p>In S. Scripture, there's not one of those <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants</hi>
to which they pretend, but was of Gods

it in <hi>Horeb,</hi> there by Himself first, with his own
Voice from Heaven, He gave them the Ten
Commandements; And then for all the other
parts of his <hi>covenant,</hi> and of the Religion, to
which He bound Them, He sent it all to them
by His Deputy, <hi>Moses;</hi> 'Twas <hi>He,</hi> Gods Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent,
(and in place of King to them, <hi>Deut.</hi>
33. 5.) that ordered all their <hi>Covenanting with God:</hi>
And so it held on in all <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ges, No <hi>Covenant</hi> then
ever heard of, but what the <hi>King,</hi> who stood
above them all, as in Gods place, or who by
Reason of His Absence or Age, was appointed
by the Law of God to stand in the Kings place,
prescribed it unto them, or imposed it upon
them.</p>
               <p>Howe're the people then had a part in the
<hi>Covenant,</hi> because it was for them, and with
<pb n="xxxv" facs="tcp:95660:20"/>
them, yet it was but the Obeying part, mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Duty required of Them, as one told
them, <hi>Vobis obsequii gloria relicta est,</hi> That was all
that the people had to do with it; Upon them it
was laid to see it performed; But as for the <hi>Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>
part, the Authority in calling them to a <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi>
and in designing, what the Tenor of that
<hi>Covenant</hi> (this, or that part of the Law) then
should be, <hi>Mandata mea mihi,</hi> was Gods Rule ever,
All the thousands of <hi>Israel</hi> had nothing to do in
that part, nor were ever to meddle with it: It
was Holy to the Lord that, and wholly apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
to the Supreme under Him.</p>
               <p>To hear therefore now of a <hi>Covenant for Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
without <hi>Gods Deputy</hi> to lead it; How much
more, to have it hammer'd of purpose, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
against his Leading or Medling in it, but also
by a Hellish Device (yet because of their Use,
allowed to be Holy, and very Divine) to frame
such a blessed Distinction in it, as safely thereby
to commit an Horrible Rape in the presence of
God, and by force to snatch from <hi>Him His Royal
Authority,</hi> and to Arm <hi>His Subjects</hi> with it against
<hi>His Person,</hi> and so, They to lead Him to what
they list, and (at last) to the very block,) and
yet must this be countenanced out of <hi>Gods Word?</hi>
And must it go for <hi>His Covenant,</hi> that is so flatly
against Him? <hi>Gods Covenant</hi> point blank against
<hi>Gods Anointed?</hi> Blessed Lord! What Logick call
they This?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="xxxvi" facs="tcp:95660:21"/>
I must deal plainly. It can grow no where,
but where <hi>this Covenant</hi> it self grew; There in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it has ever been found, what Reason soe're,
and proof to the contrary, yet all the Reason,
when they are at a pinch, that they regard to go
by, is, <hi>It is so, Because it is so.</hi> And therefore they
must, and will have it so, If a Bible in Hand,
with Powder, and Shot will do it.</p>
               <p>But you shall not trust me alone in this point.
Use your own Eyes, I beseech you, while I shall
bestow so much Time upon them, as to point a
finger to all their Examples.</p>
               <p>The first, I can meet with, was in <hi>Moab,</hi> more
then 40. years after that in <hi>Horeb,</hi> when all the first
Breed was dead, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31. 9. and then <hi>Moses</hi> in
stead of God (there you have the Doer of it)
He manages the business, and engages the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
as at first he had done their Fathers, to the
observing the Law of their God. There you have
the Matter of it.</p>
               <p>2. In <hi>Sechem,</hi> the same was done again, much
after such a distance of Time, but the difference
else, in the main, none. For the same Law it
was, and 'twas <hi>Joshua</hi> now that did it. <hi>Josh.</hi>
24. 25.</p>
               <p>3. After that, I do not light upon another,
but what I acquainted you with, of <hi>Baal Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rith,</hi>
till the <hi>Covenant</hi> made in <hi>Hebron,</hi> and that
seems to have been onely about the Temporal
<pb n="xxxvii" facs="tcp:95660:21"/>
Government; 'Twas in effect, but an Oath of
Allegiance, taken in the presence of God, and
<hi>David</hi> the King Himself He takes it of them,
2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>4. The next was at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and it was one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
about the Religion; At which they were all
to swear solemnly, <hi>To seek the Lord,</hi> that was, <hi>To
worship Him onely,</hi> upon pain of Death, as the
Law of old was: But <hi>Asa</hi> the King He renewed
it now, and put it upon them, 2 <hi>Par.</hi> 15. 9.</p>
               <p>5 Another after it there was at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and
it was of both, both for the <hi>Religion, for the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Worship of God,</hi> (for <hi>Baals</hi> Religion had
been interloping) and for their <hi>Obedience to their
true King Joash;</hi> He was but a Child indeed, not
seven years old, and <hi>Athaliah</hi> had usurped the
Throne; But yet all was now in his Name, and
his Right, and done all by <hi>Jehoiada</hi> his Uncle, who
was the High-Priest, and the Kings High Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector,
2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 11. 17.</p>
               <p>6, <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s Covenant followed next. And
to that the King first assembles all the Priests and
the Levites, and gives them in charge to sanctifie
themselves, and to purge the Temple, (for much
pollution there had been) and to set all things
right there, for the right Service of God. And
the Reason he gives them is, <hi>For it is in my heart to
make the Covenant for the Lord,</hi> 2 <hi>Par.</hi> 29. 10. And
to that purpose he calls the whole Kingdome to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
2 <hi>Par.</hi> 30. 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="xxxviii" facs="tcp:95660:22"/>
7. Shall we need any more? There's one
Example yet, in a Time none of the orderlyest,
when <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was beset with the Army of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilon,
Jer.</hi> 34. 7. and what was that? A Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
as the present occasion then gave them, of
renewing one point of their Law long disused,
and <hi>Zedekiah</hi> the King was he that did it <hi>ver.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>8. And one more yet: For after the return
from Captivity, there's an Oath made by all <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi>
for performance of another particular, then
most necessary: And who was the Authour of
that? The people, if ever, now surely. No;
'Twas <hi>Ezra</hi> the Priest, but as a Commissioner,
come into the Land, with Authority from <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes</hi>
the great King, and so he takes it in
hand, when <hi>Shecaniah,</hi> a Prince of the blood
Royal, (but, in no Commission) by moving
him earnestly to it, acknowledges, That it was
not lawfull for any of them, for all of them, to
set upon it without Him: [<hi>Arise,</hi> saith he, <hi>because
this matter belongs to thee, and we are to be ordered
by thee; But be thou couragious and do it.</hi>] <hi>Ezra.</hi> 10.
3. &amp; 4.</p>
               <p>9. And that I may not seem to balk any, Take
one more yet, that has not the word of a <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
in it, but in Truth it amounts to no less, an
Oath with a Curse upon them all, if they do not
the Law, that God had prescribed them, <hi>Nehem.</hi>
10. 29. wherein He as the <hi>Tirshatha</hi> (the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
<pb n="xxxix" facs="tcp:95660:22"/>
Governour in Commission) is the Leader
of all. <hi>ver.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>And now, I think, I have left out none: Let
this <hi>Covenanting</hi> Generation come now, and bring
out their <hi>Baal Berith,</hi> that <hi>Idol Covenant;</hi> And say,
which of these is the Copy they pretend to go by,
for an Example in S. Scripture.</p>
               <p>Will they be able to shew you, they have put
nothing in their <hi>Covenant,</hi> but what was there
of old, to be readily found in the Word and Will
of God? Or rather, clean contrary, very much
of it, such as God abhorrs, so flat against God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
Loyalty, Justice, and Truth?</p>
               <p>Was God also at the making of it? Which of
them sate at the Tables head for Him: Who
was Gods Deputy in it? What was His Name,
that had power to call them to it, and to require
it of them? Well! Let them look to their Copy
a little better; For Covenant of God it will never
be, whose soever it proves to be, unless these two
Conditions, The plain Will of God, and the
Right Officer under God, both be clearly in it.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="subpart">
               <head>3. All honest Covenants, are Gods.</head>
               <p>Though I do not look, such Zelots as they
are, should leave clamouring still for their
<hi>Covenant,</hi> in that I spy another starting hole they
have yet. For Agreements between man and
man, private Covenants, touching Ordinary
<pb n="xl" facs="tcp:95660:23"/>
things, are in S. Scripture stiled, <hi>The Covenant of God.</hi>
And shall not then a consent of all the People
be Sacred? The Resolution of whole Nations
much more be counted so, and without any
Question be set upon <hi>Gods score?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the Truth is, this they say, hath not a
little truth in it. For that <hi>Covenant</hi> which <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi>
and <hi>David</hi> entred into 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 3, <hi>David</hi>
himself sayes, 'twas <hi>the Covenant of the Lord,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi>
20. 8. <hi>The Ordinary Contract</hi> also, which every
Wife made with her Husband, (who is to the
Wife ever in Gods stead,) 'twas <hi>the Covenant of her
God, Prov.</hi> 2. 17.</p>
               <p>Nay, we will come home to them; A League,
that the men of <hi>Tyre,</hi> Heathen men, (mark
that;) had made with the Jewes, God ownes it
so, that he acknowledges it for a <hi>Brotherly Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi>
(lo ye there) and will avenge the breach
of it, <hi>Amos</hi> 2, 9. And that <hi>Oath</hi> which the King
of <hi>Babylon</hi> had put upon the King of <hi>Judah, of
Fealty to Him,</hi> when he revolted from it, God was
so highly displeased, that He (to make it surer)
took His Oath, [<hi>As I live, sayes the Lord, my Oath,
which he hath despised, and my Covenant which he hath
broken, (Mine, and Mine,</hi> All now was <hi>Gods,) will
I recompence upon his own Head.</hi>] <hi>Ezech.</hi> 17. 19.</p>
               <p>By the way then upon this, shall we not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
that our godly Brethren would shew us,
whether he be the same God, still? If he be,
<pb n="xli" facs="tcp:95660:23"/>
Then how go they to work with this God, or
what order have they taken with him, about
their <hi>Oathes of Supremacy,</hi> and of <hi>Allegiance, of Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
Obedience</hi> also, and sundry other Bonds they
were in by Local Statutes upon those Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and Offices, that he had brought them
to? I but ask them this by the way.</p>
               <p>Now the Reason of all this, what is it, but
thus? Because every <hi>Covenant,</hi> be it but pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
between man and man, be it also with
whom it will be (with a Jew, or a Turk;
that's all one, by all their leaves, that would
perswade you otherwise, both at <hi>Rome</hi> and
here;) Yet if it be broken, there lies a <hi>Complaint
to God</hi> about it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 55. 21. For supposing the
thing agreed upon to be in it self Just and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
(In <hi>Re Licitâ,</hi> So Lawfull, as that Well and
Rightly it may be done; How much more, if it
be <hi>Res Debita,</hi> So Due, as that of Right it ought to
be done!) 'Tis not onely a Branch of the <hi>Law of
God,</hi> as a Quil out of that wing, and in that Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
entitles God to it;</p>
               <p>But also, seeing the Parties were agreed to call
God to it, (and call him they did at the making
of it,) both as a witness in it, and as the Judge
of it, and also as th' Avenger for it, thus all <hi>honest
Covenants</hi> come to be <hi>Gods;</hi> Let but the matter be
Justifiable and Due, have Truth and Honesty in
it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and whose bargain so e're it be, or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soe're
<pb n="xlii" facs="tcp:95660:24"/>
it be driven, be it but in a Scriveners shop,
nay under a Hedg, (as <hi>Jonathan's</hi> and <hi>David's</hi> was
little other, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 16.) yet it binds, because
of the Power and Presence of God.</p>
               <p>But 'oth' tother side, if the matter agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
be naught and Illegal, carry it any Iniquity
folded up in it, 'tis never good then from the
beginning, far enough from having any <hi>Interest
in God,</hi> ne're hope for't, there's no beguiling of
him, all the <hi>Combining</hi> in the world cannot
make God their Pandar. No, All in that
kind is but <hi>Vinculum Iniquitatis,</hi> and the more So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity
or Admixture of Holy Forms, the worse
the business ever, and the sooner must men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
and utterly forsake it. For 'tis no better
then, then what's usually to be found in Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate-hole,
or on Shooters Hill; No circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Time, or Place, or Persons, or Manner, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing else, can hallow it.</p>
               <p>But then over and above all this, 'Tis another
thing quite, when tis ordained to carry a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity
between God, and men, ayming at any
Publick Obligement of themselves unto God.
For there, be they never so many, the People are
all but one Party still, there's but one side, yet;
So all this while tis a Covenant with no Body,
till God make himself a Party; Some body
therefore must be there for <hi>Him,</hi> for <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then, for the best of our Brethren (wo
<pb n="xliii" facs="tcp:95660:24"/>
is me for them; They are indeed Hail fellow
with God in too many things;) to make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
that they have him at a whistle, and can
force God, to make one at it, whether He will
or no, or when they would have Him, if they
do but hold up a finger; By their good leaves,
this falls under that of <hi>David, The Fool said in his
heart, Non Deus. Psal.</hi> 14. 1. 'Tis to make <hi>Him</hi>
their Drudge, and not their God; No God,
such a one, be bold on't, but a Servant, so mean
and vile a servant, that an honest mans slave would
be loath to change with him.</p>
               <p>Make no other Account therefore, but that
the Verdict here must needs go against them;
'Twill be found <hi>Frowardly</hi> and <hi>Falsly,</hi> more then
enough, and cast they will be (all the sort of
them) for <hi>perverse</hi> carriage in the <hi>Covenant of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Time was, I find, when the Prophet would
have been content, if he might, to have excused
such another company of them; But on no side
could he look, that it proved not <hi>False play,</hi> every
way: He is forced therefore to give it over, and
to find the Bill, <hi>Though they swear, The Lord liveth,
yet to be sure, they swear falsly,</hi> sayes he, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. 2.
How so? Because what they swear, much of it
is that, that is false, the rest, is that they mean
to make false.</p>
               <p>Howbeit then, afore it come to that, here's a
step in the Text, that must well be look't to. For
<pb n="xliv" facs="tcp:95660:25"/>
in any matter of our Duty to God and Man,
suppose it our Allegiance, or any other due O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
Know we must, 'tis a spice of <hi>Froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
not to be forward, not toward ever, and
zealously ready to perform our Duty, so bent
upon it, that we need not fear to appeal unto
God about it.</p>
               <p>Much more then savours it of extreme <hi>unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness,</hi>
to seek excuses, or delayes in it, and to
be ready to take any diversions from it, or occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
against it: But then, of all the rest, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
hotly to it, and yet to go quite another
way; When they make a <hi>Solemn Covenant</hi> for it,
and needs will pull God in to be a party, then to
<hi>swear falsly,</hi> this the Prophet calls, <hi>Judgment spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up as Hemlock, Hos.</hi> 10. 4. And his meaning is,
No Venome so abominable, and gross as this,
So that 'twill be impossible to escape the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="subpart">
               <head>How to be known, this.</head>
               <p>BUt how then? Where are we now? Will
any plead Ignorance in it? Will they alledge,
That that they do in it, being commonly and
loudly cry'd up for the <hi>Covenant of God,</hi> And that,
not in the Streets alone by a Rabble, but amidst
the Sages, and the Common-Councils; Nay,
the very Pulpits of those, that ever bare their
Heads for mighty Prophets among them, sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="xlv" facs="tcp:95660:25"/>
out nothing else continually, but <hi>the Goodness of
the Cause,</hi> and <hi>the Curse upon Meroz, Judg.</hi> 5. 23.
Damnation to them, that joyned not in such a
Duty, How should other Men be able to Judge
it? Which way should one of a Thousand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the People be able to tell himself, Whether
it were the <hi>Covenant of God</hi> or no?</p>
               <p>All this hath fully been resolved already, by
those two infallible Marks, First, If it have any
thing else in it, that is not to be had out of the
Word and Will of God, by a Clear Consequence
from it. Next, if it be a Headless piece, and
Gods Vicegerent, His true Deputy, be not the
Stipulator for God, and the Leader in it. And
though the former of these two may be thought
too deep for e'ry one to skill of, yet the second
is plain enough, and he that has but half an Eye
may easily discover it.</p>
               <p>But what shall we need to go further then the
Text for it? I pray do but mark that. The care
of <hi>Gods Church</hi> there, is, To clear her self to God,
from <hi>Perversness,</hi> from all that may be called
<hi>Lying, and froward dealing in His Covenant.</hi> Well
and good then; If <hi>Gods Covenant</hi> be such, so pure
and holy, that it may not abide any <hi>Lying,</hi> upon
no terms endure any <hi>frowardness</hi> of ours, or <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse</hi>
behaviour in us, so much as to be mingled
with it, To build upon it then, absolutely in it
self, there can be no such matter, No <hi>froward
<pb n="xlvi" facs="tcp:95660:26"/>
dealing</hi> must there ever be, no false meaning at all
in it, or else <hi>Covenant</hi> it must be none of <hi>Gods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Put it upon that Issue then, let the good Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God look but to that, and go no further;
Leaving them all their Sophistry and Pulpit
slights, examine you no more but that. Say then,
Find you <hi>false pretending</hi> in it? (You have had it
long enough, to know it throughly.) Is any
thing said there, in that <hi>Covenant,</hi> that you see is
not, never was, intended? Find you any <hi>Lying</hi>
at all, either in the Device, or in the Carriage of
it? Is one thing said, and quite another thing
done? Go to then, This is enough. For, if
so, then this is <hi>Falsly and Frowardly,</hi> to be sure :
And by this then 'tis clear, that 'tis none of <hi>Gods
Covenant.</hi> Now this every man of you is able to
discover, that can but tell Twenty.</p>
               <p>I must be bold therefore to tell you; He that
sees it not, it is not for want of Eyes, nor for
want of Light, (either of these indeed would
be some excuse,) but 'tis for want of Will one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
As our Saviour hath turned it out of the
Prophet, <hi>Their Eyes are shut,</hi> sayes He, <hi>Esay</hi> 6. 9.
<hi>But they themselves have shut them,</hi> sayes Christ,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 15. And why? <hi>Because the god of this
world hath blinded their minds,</hi> saith S. <hi>Paul, 2 Cor.</hi>
4. 4. There's the business; And now, rather then
not enjoy this world; that God shall content
them, a God he is there called, and now be the
<pb n="xlvii" facs="tcp:95660:26"/>
                  <hi>Covenant</hi> what it will be, so that upon any report
God be there, They will look for no other God
in it, least otherwise the Crosses of this world
should betide them for it.</p>
               <p>But then, this also is point blank against the
Text. For that begins, <hi>And though all this be come
upon us, yet do we not forget thee, nor behave our selves
frowardly in thy Covenant.</hi> No play false with
God they would not, to ease themselves of any
misery that was fallen upon them : Much less,
had they already done it, to prevent the coming
of it; Least of all, onely for filthy lucres sake,
to make themselves gainers and to suck advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
out of the milk of any other Covenant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pactum Iuum,</hi> therefore they were still able to
say to God, and not <hi>Pactum Nostrum?</hi> They knew
no other <hi>Covenant,</hi> but <hi>His.</hi> But that, they so
well knew to be <hi>His,</hi> Given by <hi>Him</hi> alone, and
not taken up by men (no new Humane, Forgery
shall I call it? or rather idolatry, made, as Idols
use ever to be, after some resemblance of <hi>Gods Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi>
and coloured very like it?) that they
would be able to give him a true account of His
own, and of their upright dealings in it.</p>
               <p>Yet I would now pray you, to mark that also,
that <hi>In Pacto Tuo,</hi> is all they say : they pretend
to no more; It is no Pharisaical brag of them
this, as who should say, their doings were quite
without Sin, or, that they would justifie all
<pb n="xlviii" facs="tcp:95660:27"/>
their wayes before God; Far be it from them,
to have any such thought<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> No? 'Tis onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
here, as concerning the point of their <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance,</hi>
and of <hi>their Worshipping</hi> of God aright.</p>
               <p>You may trace it out by this; For nothing
carries the <hi>Name of God</hi> so much, and so kindly,
as those two do, <hi>The worship of God, and Gods Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent.</hi>
Now they presently expound themselves
so; <hi>That they had not forgotten the Name of their God,
ver.</hi> 21. Their meaning therefore here must
needs be, That to the <hi>Rule of his Worship,</hi> which
was given them in <hi>His Name,</hi> Or to that <hi>Authority,</hi>
which bare <hi>His Name,</hi> and had given the <hi>Rule,</hi>
they could never be brought to shew any <hi>froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And from hence those three Children of God,
no doubt, drew their pattern. Charged indeed
they were upon grievous pains to forgoe the <hi>right
Worship of God,</hi> and to do as others did, to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
the New Image, that was all of gold, <hi>Dan</hi> 3.
10. But these golden pretences could not work
upon them; Their answer therefore was ready,
<hi>Our God whom we serve is able to deliver us, and He
will deliver us;</hi> That was well, if they were sure
of that part: <hi>But if not, be it known, we will not
worship any new Image,</hi> whatsoever come of it. An
Holy and a brave Resolution this! But no more
then is due from all Gods Servants, in any such
tryals, nothing must make them transgress that
<pb n="xlix" facs="tcp:95660:27"/>
                  <hi>Covenant</hi> which they were in, for their <hi>serving of
God;</hi> If God by himself, or by his second self
the King, call'd for no altering, they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to endure any, much less, to induce any.</p>
               <p>And what we say of our <hi>Religion,</hi> must still be
taken of our <hi>Allegiance also;</hi> They ever go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
And Alterations there may be in both, No
body sayes to the contrary. But then, 'tis God
alone, and not man, that must alter them. It
was for nothing else, that God, after he had
changed the Government of <hi>Israel</hi> from one form
to another, till at last he had brought it to Kings,
and in that course had once removed it too, from
<hi>Saul</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> yet then He set up his rest, and to
tell them so, He term'd it <hi>His Covenant, Psalm.</hi> 89.
3. <hi>I have made it a Covenant with my servant David,
and his seed after him, to last for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this it was, that made <hi>David's</hi> great Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child
<hi>Abiah,</hi> to chalenge it by the <hi>Right of God,</hi> as
<hi>given to David, and to his sons by a Covenant of salt,</hi>
2 <hi>Par.</hi> 13. 5. That <hi>Abiah</hi> was not ith' right though,
and that his Argument held not, it was Because
God himself had there made the Division of the
Kingdoms, and had sent one Prophet to foretel
it, 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 11. 35. and another after to warrant it,
<hi>The thing is done by me, 2 Par.</hi> 11. 4.</p>
               <p>But otherwise, by man it could never else have
been done rightly, nor would it ever have held;
No man, not all the men in the Kingdom (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
<pb n="l" facs="tcp:95660:28"/>
is told you of the Power of the People, by
those that worship that many headed Monster)
had Power or Authority to alter that <hi>Covenant of
God with David,</hi> more then they had to alter his
<hi>Covenant of the Day and the Night in their Seasons,</hi>
sayes God himself, if men would believe him,
<hi>Jerem.</hi> 33. 21. They were never to meddle with
it, unless God himself gave order expresly in it.</p>
               <p>You shall find it so in the forenamed Psalm,
There 'tis, <hi>My Covenant with David, Psal.</hi> 89. 3.
and <hi>My Covenant shall stand fast with him. ver.</hi> 29.
and <hi>My Covenant will I not break, ver.</hi> 34. and who
dare now go contrary? And yet at last we hear
of him, <hi>Thou art displeased at him, and thou hast bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the Covenant of thy Servant, ver.</hi> 38. Yes, <hi>Thou
hast!</hi> God may do it, No man denies that; But
the men that do it without order from God,
Howe'ere they make the Success of their Sin to be
a sign of Gods Will, Out alas, 'tis no such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
'Tis but a <hi>Lie in His Covenant</hi> all they do, and
the men of Belial they are for it, and God will
not suffer them to go unavenged, (first or last,)
that do it: No, nor them neither (I fear me) that
suffer it, and yield to have other men do it.</p>
               <p>And I could now shew you the like of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Priesthood also, For <hi>God is in Covenant</hi> likewise
with them, and <hi>His Covenant</hi> with them is by
Himself (once and again) set in the same equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page
with <hi>his Covenant of the Kingdom,</hi> and with
<pb n="li" facs="tcp:95660:28"/>
                  <hi>his Covenant of the day and night, Jer.</hi> 33. 22. And
had it not been ever meant so, it had been but
an odd Farewell, that the Blessed Son of God
(when he had now altered the Priesthood, as he
had Power to do) took off his twelve Apostles;
For <hi>Loe I am with you alway unto the end of the world,</hi>
are the last words He sayes to them, <hi>Math.</hi> 28. 20.</p>
               <p>But loe, By your leave, you shall not, Sir,
have the brave <hi>Baal Berithans,</hi> your new <hi>Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
sworn, if men will but rightly conster them :
For to <hi>be with Them to the end of the world,</hi> Christ
could not mean it, not with the Apostles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
That was impossible, but in their Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors;
And the Successors of the Apostles were
those, whom the Apostles themselves called Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
with whom the Apostles left the Power
of <hi>Ego mitto Vos,</hi> of continuing that Order, or of
Subordaining any New. And concerning the
Bishops, you know what the <hi>Covenanters</hi> have
sworn, and in very that, have forsworn suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently.</p>
               <p>But I make no stay at this, though I thought
it not unfit to cast it in, onely by the way, because
of their word <hi>Covenant,</hi> that you might have a
taste of all the <hi>Covenants of God,</hi> and of these mens
Counter-Covenanting. But I have another-gates
<hi>Covenant</hi> now to conclude all with.</p>
               <p>Full well therefore may this <hi>Covenant</hi> in the
Text be said to concern the <hi>King, Gods Secular Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister,
<pb n="lii" facs="tcp:95660:29"/>
and the Priest, Gods Spiritual Minister,</hi> when
as Christ himself, (the Son of God; He, the
King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, the Author
of all our Religion, our great High Priest, and
the Bishop or our Souls, the very root there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of all Episcopacy, which they shall never
be able to root out, howe're they may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
lopp of His Branches, He that is the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
of all that are His <hi>to be Kings and Priests unto
God his Father, Apoc.</hi> 1. 6.) is Himself the very <hi>Covenant,</hi>
for all those that belong unto <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Think not strange of this, I can shew you the
very Charter of it, and 'tis worthy your look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on. It begins in a most Solemn and Divine
Form, <hi>Thus saith God the Lord, He that created the
Heavens, and stretched them out, that spreadeth forth
the Earth, and all that comes out of it; That giveth
Breath to all People upon it, and Spirit to all that walk
therein; I the Lord have called Thee in Righteousness,
and I will take Thee by thy Hand, and will preserve Thee,
and will give Thee for a Covenant to the People, for a
Light to the Gentiles. Esay</hi> 42. 5, 6. And lest that
should not stick with them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> again he is at it,
<hi>In an acceptable time, and in the day of Salvation, will I
give Thee for a Covenant of the People. Esay</hi> 49. 8.
Now we have S. <hi>Pauls</hi> warrant, That time was
then, when Christ was given, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6 2.</p>
               <p>There are of the succeeding Prophets also ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
in it. By <hi>Jeremy</hi> the Record of it is at large
<pb n="liii" facs="tcp:95660:29"/>
set down, under the Title of <hi>a New Covenant, Jer:</hi>
31. 31. And that he means it all <hi>of the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
Christ,</hi> is clear by the Apostles recital of it,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 8. Then, it was a New one : But ever it
was to be New, because to last Eternally, never
no other <hi>Covenant</hi> to be after <hi>It,</hi> after <hi>Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And so likewise <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> after many Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Amplifications of it, and exclusive all to the
old Covenant, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 61, He reduces it all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this Personal Aphorisme, <hi>I will be their God, and
they shall be my People, Ezek</hi> 37. 27. And that this
also is all meant of Christ himself, the same A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
informs us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 16.</p>
               <p>For the Love of God then, I beseech you all,
have some care of your Souls, and be not thus
fooled out of them. Away with all other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,
All these <hi>Baal Beriths,</hi> these Idol, new-fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
<hi>Covenants;</hi> Avant All, but the <hi>Covenant of
Grace in Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in the Ministration of <hi>It,</hi> what alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
at any Time are needful, doubt it not, but
God is more mindful, then You; and when He
sees Time, that God (that when need was, did
put it into that way, that so long you had then
forgotten, into the Heart of His Deputy the <hi>King,
and of his Bishops at the Reformation,</hi> to do it:) is
the same <hi>God</hi> still, the <hi>God</hi> of his <hi>Church</hi> : And
needs no <hi>Aerian Presbyters</hi> now, to lift up a <hi>lying
Hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> because God is asleep, to waken Him.
<pb n="liv" facs="tcp:95660:30"/>
No, God is awake in His Holy Temple, and
howe're he seems to wink a while, yet they will
find, that He sees through all, <hi>Et palpebrae ejus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogant,
Psal.</hi> 11. 5. His very Eye-lids try the
Children of Men.</p>
               <p>Hold we onely therefore to this <hi>sure Covenant of
God,</hi> that, in it self (we are sure) is Christ, and
as to us, 'tis with Christ, in Christ, and for
Christ, and Christ (to be sure) will see well
enough to it, without any of these new (bold,
and blind,) Seers.</p>
               <p>Be we therefore All in All alone for <hi>Christ,</hi> for
our <hi>Anointed Lord,</hi> and for the <hi>Lords Anointed,</hi> Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Care for nothing else, but <hi>not to behave our
selves perversely in this Covenant,</hi> no way to be <hi>fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and untoward to Him.</hi> Of all the rest, not to
put such foul scorns upon Him, as if He needed
<hi>our Lying,</hi> and could not well be <hi>God</hi> any longer,
without our abominable Dissembling, which
was the <hi>Badge</hi> that <hi>Christ</hi> put upon the old <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saisme,</hi>
and is the very Soul of that new <hi>Scotish
Covenant.</hi> [Now <hi>God</hi> be merciful unto them all,
that lie but within the Shadow of it. <hi>Amen.</hi>
