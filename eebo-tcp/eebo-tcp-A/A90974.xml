            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

A froward pen oft times ſtir up other mens paſſions, but ſeldome ſetleth any mans judgement, frow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardneſſe raiſeth up frowardneſſe, and ſtrife ſtirreth up ſtrife, and both together rejoyceth the Divell and ſporteth his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and the truth is neglected all the while: He that endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors to conquer error with good ſucceſſe, muſt bring along with him meekeneſſe and truth, and having both may ride on and proſper. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 4.</p>
            <p>Seventhly. Men doe ſeldome contend for truth in a rayling dialect, it is miſtery more then truth that is ſo ſought out, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, envie, hatred, mallice are the fruits of the fleſh, and can theſe contend for their diſtroyer the ſpirit of truth? an unbrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led tongue, a licentious pen, is the common charracter of a rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten heart, 1 <hi>James</hi> 26. The paſſion of the pen above that of the tongue is the more dangerous ſigne that the heart is rotten: A paſſionate tongue doth many times argue the diſtempers of the head, when the conſent of the heart cannot begotten<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but a rayling pen doth clearly evince the hearts mallice, commanding the head to ſubſerve the ſame, a paſſionate tongue doth often declare a man robbed of his reaſon, but a paſſionate pen doth more clearely evince a man robbed of the truth, for his reaſon is ranged in his malicious lines, the paſſion of the tongue doth largely proclaime ſin in the heart, but the paſſion of the pen the heart in ſin, for deliberation, invention, memory, witt, reaſon, all are commanded by that heart of ſin, truth triumphs only in tittle, but pride and arrogancy in the matter it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Eightly, Conſider how doth it gratifie the deſignes of the adverſarie, that the Saints ſhould thus wrangle each with his brother, how doth this cheare up the popiſh, Epiſcopall, Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteriall, Independent, Antinominicall, Annabaptiſticall, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite: For I preſume the Jeſuite perſonates them all: and whoſe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:154991:5"/>
ends we proſecute by our unhappie diviſions amongſt our ſelves, how is this told in <hi>Gath,</hi> and publiſhed in <hi>Askalon,</hi> how doe the daughters of the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> rejoyce? and the daughters of the uncircumciſed triumph? How doe they jeare at our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that we our ſelves proves thornes in one anothers eyes, and goade in one anothers ſides? boaſting that they laſht us with rods, but we our ſelves with ſcorpions, and that our own little fingers will be heavier upon one another, then their loines were upon us all. They oppreſt us and we were pitied of all, we oppreſſe our ſelves and then who pitieth us: They ruin'd us by an uſurpation, and ſhal we ſtrive to ruine one another by a law? They cruſh't us by the heavie ſentences of the Heigh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, &amp; Star Chamber, &amp; ſhal we endeavour to do the ſame by the Authority of Parliament? If we love not one another, let us love our ſelves, for each undermineth his owne ſecurity by circumventing his brothers peace.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, Conſider how do Saints looſe in each others hearts, when they gall and greive and vex one another in each others pen. To give milke and honey for vinegar and gall, bleſſing for curſing, kind words for bitter language, this is indeed our duty, but hereunto who hath attained? And ſhall we tempt one another with ſuch provocations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sorrow and trouble, perſecution and affliction, envie and mallice, evill ſpeaking and railing, we expect from the world, but bitter quarter from bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter people: The Saints ſhould be each others ſhelter, we doe not gather grapes from thornes, not briers from vines, men doe not gather figs from thiſtles, nor prickles from figg trees. Churliſh language I expect from a <hi>Nabell,</hi> not from a <hi>David,</hi> Scoffs from an <hi>Iſmael</hi> not from an <hi>Iſaack,</hi> Rayling from a <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheika,</hi> not from an <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> Dungeons from an <hi>Ahab,</hi> not from a <hi>Michaiah,</hi> Priſons from an <hi>Herod,</hi> not from <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt, Chaines from a <hi>Nero,</hi> not from a <hi>Paul,</hi> Baniſhment from <hi>Flavius Domitian,</hi> not from <hi>Iohn</hi> the Evangeliſt, Jeares from a <hi>Iulian,</hi> not from a Chriſtian. No, no, gentleneſſe and meekeneſſe, love and peace, kindneſſe and goodneſſe, bowells of mercy and compaſſion from the hearts and tongues, the hands and pens of all wherein dwells the ſpirit of Chriſt. But when our expectations are failed, looking for peace with <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:154991:5"/>
and no good comes, for helpe from the Saints and behold trouble. When our brethren turnes Dragons, as <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith, and we are <hi>companions to Owles</hi> even birds of prey: How will <hi>our bowels boyle and reſteth not, our harpe turnes into mourning, and our Organs into the voice of them that weepe?</hi> Job 30. 29. 31. Hard ſpeeches and heavie hands upon the Saints of God from great Profeſſors, proud lookes, and ſwelling words have formerly been the certaine prognoſticks of approaching Apoſtacy: and that Charracter ſeldome failes. As for my part God give me fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vour in the eyes of thoſe who are his Favourites, love in their hearts, intreſt in their prayers, and make me to the uttmoſt a friend and a favourer of them, however they differ from me in my judgement.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, Conſider, wrangling, writing, and rayling lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage each againſt other in our owne party, haſtneth our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and hindreth our reformation and who but a Jeſuite delighteth herein? What is it which obſtructeth the Parliament Aſſemblie, or Armies, but our unhappie diviſions amongſt our ſelves? We want love, and where love is not, where is our pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? and where there is no unity, there is as little policie. For my part the unhappie quarrell between <hi>Presbyterian</hi> and <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent</hi> ſpeaketh as ſadly to me, and threatneth as ſorely, as the wofull diſtance between King and Parliament, and the happie reconciliation of the former parties would quit my thoughts of the feare of the latter, and happie ſhould that man be called by this preſent age, which ſhould prove an inſtrument of ſo good a worke, But where is that pen of peace? and that heart of love? that ſpirit of meekeneſſe? and that head of wiſedome? How beautifull ſhould the very feet of thoſe be which could bring ſuch tydings of joy to this Kingdome.</p>
            <p>Eleventhly, Conſider, the difference is more in the heart then in the head, in the affections then in the judgement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is more dangerous becauſe leſſe reconcileable, a gracious heart commands the head to hearken to truth, but a more ſound head cannot command a perverſe mind, the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the parties we ſpeake of is more in ſhew, then in deed and truth, the Presbyterian is departed from Epiſcopacy. the Independent queſtions ſuch and ſuch a qualified Presbyterie, but they that are godly of both parties, are not engaged paſt a

retreat to the truth of God. Who ever can ſhew it, could each of us lovingly here his brother, happily each might be bettered by the other, thoſe that are the ſtrongeſt Antagoniſts about Diſcipline ſuppoſe it a peice of policie, not of divinity, and is it policie for the Saints to ruine one another? Inteligent men are of opinion that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> each partie would with meekeneſſe and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence here one another, reconciliation between them would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the iſſue, and ſhall we deſtroy one another before we will give one another the heating? What aparrant untruths, and groſſe miſtakes even in matters of fact have beene reported of their diſſenting brethren; for want of hearing them ſpeake for themſelves? I could inſtance in many in mine owne obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, but that the making up, and not the widenning of breaches is my preſent purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Twelfthly, Conſider the deare relation wherein we ſtand each to other in Jeſus Chriſt, Have we not the ſame Lord? the ſame faith? the ſame baptiſme? Did not we all lie together as it were in the ſame wombe of the Almighties gratious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe? are we not all the price of the ſame ranſome? the redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the ſame Saviour? Doth not the ſame ſpirit of Jeſus breath in our hearts? the ſame blood of Jeſus runne in our veines? Are we not all brethren in the faith? and ſhall breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren reproach brethren? brethren rayle againſt brethren? brethren undermine the peace and comfort of one another, is it brotherly to diſcover one anothers weakeneſſes, failings, and indiſcretions? brethren accuſe brethren? brethren betray bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren? What! brethren without bowells? without naturall affection to brethren? Who but a <hi>Cain</hi> will ſeeke the ruine of a brother <hi>Abell,</hi> becauſe his holy ſervices are more acceptable then his owne? Who but a <hi>Ham</hi> will betray the nakedneſſe of his owne familie? God put enmity between Satan and Saints, but Satan puts enmity between Saints and Saints; whoſe workes they doe that foment the ſame. <hi>An ungodly man dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth up evill, and in his lips there is a burning fire, and a froward man ſoweth ſtrife, and a whiſperer ſeparateth chiefe freinds.</hi> Pro. 16. 27. 28. and it is a <hi>wicked man that walketh</hi> with a froward mouth, <hi>Pro.</hi> 6. 12. And ſhall ſuch be found among the Saints? Oh where is that ſpirit which ſhould knit our hearts together in love? Are wee not all members of the ſame body? if one

ſuffer doe not all ſuffer? and ſhall we perſecute one another? if one be diſgrac'd doe we not all bluſh? and ſhall we ſhame one another? is love the figne of a Diſciple of Chriſt? and ſhall we hate one another? doth not each member need his fellow: and ſhall each deſtroy each other? Is the body of Chriſt the horrid monſter of theſe monſtrous times? Is it thus amongſt <hi>Turkes,</hi> and <hi>Pagans, Mahumitans, Atheiſts,</hi> or <hi>Papists?</hi> Doe Malignants thus penne it againſt Malignants, Cavaliers againſt Cavaliers? are there ſuch bitter words or bitting language? ſuch harſh ſayings or hard ſpeakings to be heard in the Camp of our adverſaries?
