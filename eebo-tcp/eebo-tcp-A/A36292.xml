            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>And the first in two respects, both because he steales from the Universe, or from that State, <note place="margin">Of stealing away himselfe from the State.</note> to which his service is due, one person, and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the body; and also, because he usurpes upon the right of God.

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:97946:66"/>
from functions in the Common-wealth, defraud the State of their assistance, and attend onely their owne ends, whether in this life, or the next.</p>
                  <p>For certainely to doe even that, so intensly, <note place="margin">3. Monastique retiring is, <hi>in genere rei,</hi> the same offence.</note> as we neglect ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

and such resemble the light of Reason, as wee have in our Second part accepted that Word.

                  <p>For the first, if any thinke that the Apostle <note place="margin">3. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of a thing which might lawfully be done, for such are all his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations in this argument.</note> here takes example of an impossible thing, as when it is sayd, <hi>[If an Angel from heaven teach other doctrine,]</hi> he will, I thinke, correct him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, if he consider the former verses, and the Apostles progresse in his argument; wherein to dignifie Charity, the most that hee can, hee undervalues all other gifts, which were there am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitiously affected.</p>
                  <p>For Eloquence he sayes, it is nothing to have <note place="margin">4. Tongues of Angels in what sence in this place.</note> all Languages, no not of Angels; which is not put literally, for they have none; but to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse a high degree of Eloquence, as <hi>Calvine</hi> sayes here. Or, as <hi>Lyra</hi> sayes, by language of Angels is meant, the desire of communicating our conceptions to one another. And then he adds, That knowledge of Mysteries and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, is also nothing; which was also much affected. And for Miraculous Faith, it is also <note place="margin">Calvin.</note> nothing. <note place="margin">5. Speech in the Asse, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of mysteries in <hi>Iudas,</hi> mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous faith make not the possessor the better.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the first of these guifts, doth not make a man better; for <hi>Balams</hi> Asse could speake, and was still an Asse. And the second <hi>Judas</hi> had, and the <hi>Pharisees.</hi> And the third is so small a matter, that as much as a <hi>graine of Musterseed is</hi>
                     <pb n="185" facs="tcp:97946:102"/>
                     <hi>enough to remove mountaines.</hi> All these therefore were faisable things, and were sometimes done. So also, after he had passed through the gifts of knowledge, and gifts of utterance, hee presents the gifts of working in the same manner; and therefore, as he sayes, <hi>If I feed the poore with all my goods,</hi> (which he presents as a harder thing then either of the other, (for in the other God gives me, but here I give other) yet possible to be done.) So he presents the last, <hi>If I give my body,</hi> as the hardest of all, and y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>t, as all the rest, sometimes to be done.</p>
                  <p>That which I observed secondly to arise from <note place="margin">6 How I dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from the <hi>Donatists</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing from this place, that in charity <hi>self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homicide</hi> was alwaies law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</note> this argument, was, That with Charity such a death might be acc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ptable. And though I know the <hi>Donatists</hi> are said to have made this use of these words, yet, because the intent and end conditions every action, and infuses the poyson, or the nourishment which they which follow suck from thence, and we know that the <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists</hi> rigorously and tyrannously racked and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted thus much from this place, That they might present themselves to others promiscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously to bee killed, and if that were denied to them, they might kill themselves, and them who refused it.</p>
                  <p>Yet, I say, I doubt not but thus much may naturally be collected from hence, that by this <note place="margin">7 To give my Body, is more then to let it be taken.</note> word, <hi>If I give my body,</hi> is insinuated some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more then a prompt and willing yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of it, when I am enforced to it, by the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:97946:103"/>
persecuting Magistrate.</p>
                  <p>And that these words will justifie the fact of <note place="margin">Metaph. in Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceph. Martyr.</note> the Martyr <hi>Nicephorus,</hi> being then in perfect Charity. Whose case was, That having had <note place="margin">8 How <hi>Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus</hi> the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre, gave his body in <hi>Sapri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> his roome, who recanted.</note> some enmitie with <hi>Sapritius,</hi> who was brought to the place where he was to receive the blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy crowne of Martyredome, he fell downe to <hi>Sapritius,</hi> and begged from him then, a pardon of all former bitternesses. But <hi>Sapritius</hi> elated with the glory of Martyredome, refused him; but was presently punished; for his faith coold, and he recanted, and lived. And <hi>Nicephorus</hi> stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by, stepped into his roome, and cryed, I am also a Christian, and so provoked the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate to execute him; least from the faintnesse of <hi>Sapritius,</hi> the cause might have received a wound, or a scorne. And this I take to bee <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of his body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of which, as there may be such necessitie for <note place="margin">9 There may be a case that a man bound to give his body, cannot doe it otherwise then by <hi>selse-homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide.</hi>
                     </note> confirming of weaker Christians, that a man may be bound to doe it, as in this case, is very probable. So there may bee cases in men very exemplary, and in the cunning and subtile car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the Pesecutor, as one can no other way give his body for testimony of Gods truth, to which he may then be bound, but by doing it himselfe.</p>

                  <p>So that renowned <note n="b" place="margin">Paul. Sever. Epist. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>Paulinus</hi> sayes, <hi>[God send me the death of</hi> Sampson, <hi>and</hi> Sampsons <hi>blindnesse, that I may live to God, and looke to</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>And this generall applause and concurrence in the praise of the fact, hath made many think, <note place="margin">4 They which deny that he meant to kill himselfe, are cofuted by the text.</note> or at least write, that he purposed not to kill him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: being loath either to depart from their opinion who extoll him, or to admit any thing which may countenance that manner of dying. Of which perswasion <note n="c" place="margin">Fran. de Vict. in relect. de Hom. Greg. Valent. tom. 3. disp. 5. q. 8. p. 1.</note> two very learned men labour to seeme to be.</p>
                  <p>But, besides that such an exposing of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to unevitable danger, is the same fault as
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:97946:111"/>
                     <hi>Selfe-homicide,</hi> when there is any fault in it, the very Text is against them; for <hi>Samson</hi> dyed with these words in his mouth, <note n="d" place="margin">Jud. 16. 30.</note> 
                     <hi>[Let mee lose my life with the philistims.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And though sometimes these Authors adde, <note place="margin">5 They which say he did not intend his own death princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally say the same as we. <hi>Supra.</hi>
                     </note> That hee intended not his owne death princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally, but accidentally (as <hi>Calvine</hi> also sayes, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did not desire death for deaths sake, but to be with Christ,) this can remove no man from our side, for wee say the same, that this may be done onely, when the honour of God may bee promoved by that way, and no other.</p>
                  <p>Therefore to justifie this fact in <hi>Samson,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">6 That Saint <hi>Aug.</hi> his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to this fact, that it was by speciall instinct, hath no ground in the history.</note>

                  <p>To give strength to this opinion of <hi>Augustine,</hi>

                     <hi>Pedraca</hi> the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> another subsequent.</p>
                  <p>The first is that hee prepared himselfe to it by Prayer.

                     <pb n="201" facs="tcp:97946:111"/>
The second reason is, that because hee effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted <note place="margin">8. Of <hi>Pedr.</hi> his reason, that it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the work of God, because it was done as it was desired.</note> that which he desired, it is to be presumed, that God restored him his strength to that end, which he asked it. But, besides that in the text it appeares, that <note n="h" place="margin">v. 22.</note> his haire before that time, was begunne to be growne out againe, and so his strength somewhat renewed; doth this prove any impulsion, and incitement, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of the holy Ghost, to that particular act, or rather only an habituall accompanying and awaking him, to such actions by which God might be honoured and glorified, whensoever any occasion should be presented?</p>
                  <p>When therefore he felt his strength in part <note place="margin">9 That he had as much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and authority to kill himselfe as to kill the <hi>Philistims,</hi> and that it was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the glory of God.</note> refreshed, and had by Prayer intreated the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting thereof, seeing they tooke continuall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion from his dejection to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>And he dyed, as the same man sayes, with <note place="margin">10. <hi>Samson</hi> in this manner of dying was a type of Christ.</note> the same zeale as Christ, unconstrained; for <note n="k" place="margin">Perer. in Gen. 49. 16.</note>

                     <hi>[Saul dyed for his transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons against the Lord, and his word, and asking coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile of a witch.]</hi> But this doth not necessarily conclude an impenitence, or a second death.

to him: understanding <hi>Samuells</hi> words you shall be with me, to be spoken, not generally of the state of the dead, but of the state of the just, because both <hi>Samuel</hi> himself was so, and so was <hi>Jonathan,</hi> whose condition in this promise of being with <hi>Samuel,</hi> was the same as his Fathers. And therefore saith <hi>Lyra, [all Iews and some Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians agree, that least by his reproach dishonour might redound upon God, a good and Zealous man may kill himself, as</hi> Samson <hi>did, and the Virgins.]</hi> And he addeth, <hi>[If other reasons were not sufficient to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse</hi>
