            <title>The prelatical Cavalier catechized, and the Protestant souldier incouraged. By a missive sent to King Charles in the name of the Protestants beyond seas. Wherein these three questions are resolved. Viz. First, how inconsistent a prelaticall government is with the true Protestant religion, and with the peace and welfare of this kingdome. Secondly, how absolutely necessary it is for King Charles and his associats, to entertain peace with the Parliament at any hand, if ever he hopeth to recover or enjoy any glory or splendour of his royalty. Thirdly, which are the best means King Charles, &amp;c. can use for obtayning an honourable peace for the present, and improving and continuing the same in time to come. Much conducing to encourage and confirme all true Protestants in the truth of the Protestant cause, especially all souldiers that are for King and Parliament. ... Presented to the Honorable Councels of Great Britain, now sitting in Parliament; and the rest of the Kings Majesties subjects. / By Eleazer Gilbert, a minister of Gods Word.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>with brothels and whore-houſes. But when did your Highnes, or any of your fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, taxe theſe men? For not onely diſpenſing with, but even ſelling and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſing adultery, fornication, Idolatry, perjury, &amp;c. Yea, which is as it were, the very eſſence and ſoule of Church Diſcipline; (Excommunication) for ſo great was the corruption of your Biſhops, and their Officials; that for the value of twelve pence or ſome other ſuch trifling ſumme of money, a man might either be received in, or ejected and caſt out of your Hierarchicall Conſiſtory, ſo that they have made Excommunication almoſt a very <hi>Chimaera,</hi> and conſequently have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nervated, extenuated, or rather annihilated the whole ſtrength and power of your Church Government.</p>
               <p>Furhermore, we appeal unto your Highneſſe and your Aſſociates; what ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, unjuſt and prepoſterous thing it was, that theſe Biſhops Officials, being themſelves but Laick men; neither Prophets, nor perhaps bred in the Schools of the Prophets; ſhould at their own pleaſure, ſummon up from the furtheſt corners of your Kingdom; nay, and not onely ſo, but puniſh, ſuſpend, and cenſure, both the perſons and doctrine of your moſt godly, learned, and orthodox Divines; if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther themſelves or their Biſhop had conceived the leaſt ſpleen againſt them: may not the Proverb be well applied to ſuch unequall and rigid Judges, <hi>Sus Miner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vam;</hi> or may not ſuch reverend men ſay unto ſuch Laick Biſhops, as the <hi>Egyptian</hi> ſaid to <hi>Moſes, Who made you a Judge over us?</hi> In one word, if your Highneſſe will but with an impartiall eye: behold or ſurvey the ſtupendious inſolencie and corruption of your Biſhops Courts and their Officers, theſe twenty yeers paſt, &amp;c. you cannot but confeſſe with us, that they were and are no other then a company of covetous, temporizing Horſleeches come to their Conſiſtories (not ſo much to compoſe and decide differences, and to preſerve peace and piety amongſt your peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; as to get mony and enrich themſelves by the ſins of the people: whereas if this charge were committed to godly and conſcionable Paſtors and Miniſters aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted with the Suffrages of their Elders and Deacons (as it is in the government Presbyteriall all this corruption might be, or at the leaſt, the moſt part prevented. Finally, that we may perſwade your Highneſſe, &amp;c. not onely to leave, but alſo to loath the paps of that inchanting Sorcereſs: wee will adde this one thing more, <hi>viz.</hi> the greatabuſe which was committed by your Biſhops in their Ordination of Miniſters, how contrary to the Goſpell? and inconſiſtent with the practice of a Proteſtant Church is it? that the Ordination of many Miniſters ſhould be committed to the hands and authority of one man: <hi>viz.</hi> a Biſhop, and that when ſuch eaſie terms, and ſo ſmall a triall; that let an Artificer or Husbandman come to a Biſhop or his Chaplain upon ſome Ordination day, provided with ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>functory Letter, or ſuperficiall teſtimony from a man (if but of ordinary quality)
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:113147:3"/>
always provided that he hath his fees in his hand, and a black coat upon his back, and then, although hee were as falſe and wicked as ever was <hi>Judas</hi> or <hi>Cain:</hi> as void of feature and good manners, as was <hi>Therſites</hi> and had no more learning then had <hi>Balaams</hi> Aſſe. He ſhall be admitted to the Miniſterie, quite contrary to <hi>Pauls</hi> charge to <hi>Timothy;</hi> which was not to lay hands ſuddenly upon any man. Not that this authority of laying on of hands, or ordaining Miniſters belonged to him alone: as the Prelats do alleage, for this is contrary to his own practice, when 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 14. He would not be admitted himſelf without the laying on of hands, of the company of the Elderſhip; but rather to dehort him from being corrupted by the example of theſe men, who had arrogantly aſſumed unto themſelves this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and as contrary is it alſo to the practice of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas, Acts</hi> 13. 1. and theſe Deacons mentioned, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 6. From which Pontificiall preſumption, it hath come to paſſe, that in your <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prelacy (as from the <hi>Trojan</hi> Horſe) there have iſſued ſo many Apoſtolicall Preachers, who being for their fees admitted to the Miniſtery by ſome Biſhop, without any Church, ſtipend, or maintenance, are forced (as it were) to beg their bread from doore to doore, and that not out of conſcience (as the Popiſh Mendicants) but of conſtraint: they not having ſo much by their calling, as will ſupply their neceſſary ſuſtenance: or which is much worſe, ſometimes to go beyond the Seas, and there turne Apoſtates, either to the <hi>Roman, Nicholaitan,</hi> or <hi>Lutheran</hi> ſuperſtitions, or thirdly, which is as bad, or little better then the former, or rather then they ſhould ſtarve, ſome of them doe wander to <hi>Amſterdam</hi> or <hi>New England,</hi> &amp; their ſide with ſome new fangled ſchiſme: Good God how abominable ſhould this be to your Highneſſe who profeſſe your ſelfe <hi>Defender of the Faith?</hi> How diſhonourable is it to your Nation? and how prejudiciall to the true Proteſtant Religion and profeſſors thereof, who ſhould have amongſt them all but one God, one Faith, and one Baptiſme, and who ſhould have no more Miniſters amongſt them to work at their Altars, but ſuch as have a competent maintenance, and are able to live by the Altar: Is this the care of your right reverend Fathers to provide for their children, or hath your Highneſſe all this time, ſuffered your ſelfe ſo wofully to be miſled by theſe ghoſtly Vultures, as to permit them ſo ſhamefully (as the Pope doth to himſelfe and his Cardinals Nephews) to ingroſſe unto themſelves and their ſymonaicall friends (neither of whom, nor perhaps any of them ever dared to adventure themſelves beyond the ſeas to ſee the face, or learn the poſture of any Chriſtian or Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Church, or it may be hath no more learning in them then to reſolve the Biſhop of that grand queſtion) who was <hi>Melchiſedecks</hi> father? to permit ſuch men, them we ſay, ſo ſhamefully to ingroſſe to themſelves all the fatteſt Benefices in your Kingdoms, and that a few (perhaps forty or fifty prelaticall Prieſts or
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:113147:3"/>
Miniſters, by their codpiece or Court Symonie, ſhould have every one for his yearly ſtipend 1000 or 2000 li. a year at the leaſt, when it may be, 5000 more godly, learned, and every way more worthy paſtors, who have alſo a greater charge to mayntain) ſhall not have ſo much amongſt them all, but are enforced, notwithſtanding, their aſſiduous labours, and conſcionable converſation, to eat the bread of car fulneſſe, and to drink the waters of affliction by meaſure. That ſuch barbarous, or rather Antichriſtian inequality, ſhould not onely be tolerated, but alſo, with tooth and nail, ſo eagerly be mayntained, without reformation and that by a Proteſtant Prince, who ſtyleth himſelf, <hi>Defender of the Faith,</hi> and by his aſſociates who pretend and profeſſe ſo much of the Proteſtant Religion, is a thing we muſt needs confeſs beyond our admiration. What ſhould weſpeak of your admitting Popiſh Prieſts and ſacrificatures unto your parochiall charges, yea, and ſometimes to ſteer the helme of Chriſts ſhip amongſt you, without any impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of hands, admiſſion, or vocation, other then they received from the Roman Biſhops, by whom they were ordinated ſacrificers; to offer in their blaſphemous Maſſes a Sacrifice both for quick and dead which how far it doth derogate from the all-ſufficiency of Chriſts paſſion, and how far ſuch Sacrifices and Sacrificers are different from thoſe in the Goſpel: <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1. which conſiſts principally in killing and mortifying our ſinfull luſts and affections; we hope may appear eaſily to any true Proteſtant whom God hath not given over to believe ſtrong deluſions, and to hold the truth in unrighteouſneſſe nor is there any leſſe difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the calling of a Prieſt by a Popiſh Biſhop, we ſpeake as they are devoted to the errours and blaſphemies of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> as now it is unto the diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and miniſtry of the Goſpell, and the calling of a Proteſtant Miniſter by a lawfull Presbyter (for ought we know then there was betwixt the calling of <hi>Annas</hi> and <hi>Caiphas,</hi> and that of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas: Act.</hi> 13. 1. And ſo alſo we could tell your Prelates of their permitting women to baptiſe children in caſe of weakneſle, and if they cannot conveniently be brought to Church, as if the ſalvation of infants did depend upon the act of Baptiſme and not upon the free grace of God, who according to the good pleaſure of his will; and in relation to the covenant he hath made with our fathers hath elected them to ſalvation in Chriſt their Saviour for by the miniſtery of the Sacraments, Gods promiſes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us are not accompliſhed and finiſhed, but only eſtabliſhed and confirmed: here therefore is one groſſe errour more to permit women to baptiſe, whom the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 12. will not permit to teach or ſpeak in the congregation, nor to have any publike charge in the Church; certainly, if they may lawfully be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to miniſter the one Sacrament, we know no reaſon why they may not as lawfully miniſter the other, which we hope no ſound proteſtant will deny to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:113147:4"/>
be flat contrary to the ordinance of Chriſt, and a meer profanation of thoſe holy myſteries. The like alſo we might alleage of the Anabaptiſts, Browniſts, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other Schiſmatikes, that are permitted by you on both ſides to the great diſparagement of our Proteſtant Religion who although they were never brought up at the feet of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> nor bred in the ſchools of the Prophets, but meer hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen or tradeſmen, whoſe credit wealth and wit lieth in their hands and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, yet forſooth will brag of the Spirit and without any warrant or commiſſion from Chriſt or his Church, will preſume to take upon them this ſacred function, and both preach and baptiſe without any warrant or calling, other then their own private phantaſie or ſome brainſick enthuſiaſme. What need we ſay more? ſeeing that which we have already affirmed, is abundantly ſufficient to diſcover to the world that your late Engliſh, Epiſcopall Prelaticall Government, which your Highneſſe and your aſſociats do ſo ſtifly maintain, hath been no other (we mean eſpecially in point of diſcipline) then a pattern of Popery, a map of Machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aviliſme, a rapſodie of Superſtition and a bundle of corruption, in regard where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of (for ought we know) we may as lawfully ſay, that of your Church and your Church government, as <hi>Buchanan</hi> your Highneſſe Fathers Schoolmaſter ſpake of old <hi>Rome.</hi>

               <p>Furthermore let your Highneſſe and your Confederates (if you be as you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe your ſelves to be true Proteſtants, duly conſider what a great improvement this will be to the Proteſtant Religion; if you will abandon this kind of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and eſtabliſh throughout all your Dominions the government Presbyteriall; what a great heartning and encouragement to all forreigne Proteſtant Princes and profeſſors throughout <hi>Europe,</hi> who do worſhip God in ſpirit and truth &amp; are reſolved to maintain their Religion in the ſame purity it was in the Apoſtlestime, and many yeers after, untill pride, ambition and corruption began to ſway: What joyfull news (we ſay) will this be to them? that your Highneſſe and Aſſociates have reſolved to put to your helping hands towards the curtaling of the Popes horns, and that you have given ſuch a blow to the <hi>Roman</hi> Antichriſt, as that you have not only (within your Dominions) cutoff the head and members (that is, the Prelaticall Biſhops and their Court-keepers, but alſo demoliſhed and defaced the very Images, and repreſentations of that Babyloniſh Monſter; yea, that you have not onely caſhiered and diſcarced all open profeſſors of popery (ſuch as were Jeſuits, Prieſts, and others their Diſciples and Emiſſaries; but alſo all Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Dignities, Orders, Canons, Courts and Conditions of men, which did any ways concern or relliſh a popiſh Hierarchie.

then doth the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hierarchie in ſo much that ſince the beginning of your late inteſtine broyls in <hi>Great Britain,</hi> the Jeſuits have not failed to ſtirre up and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe the King and Parliament of <hi>Poland,</hi> either to baniſh and exterminate all your Highneſſe Subjects and Countrymen out of their Kingdome, or elſe to vex and charge them yeerly with ſuch grievous and unaccuſtomed taxations, as that now they can hardly gain livelihood amongſt them (notwithſtanding their labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious endevours, good deſert, and great ſervices which they have done for them) and why is all this forſooth, but becauſe they will not be of their own Kings re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; which they take for granted (to be <hi>Roman Catholick)</hi> elſe why did the Jeſuits of the City of <hi>Vilna,</hi> (wherein is the chief Tribunall and Univerſitie of the great Dukedome of <hi>Lithuania)</hi> in <hi>Anno</hi> 1641. upon their Saint <hi>Ignatius</hi> day (at which time the Jeſuits do uſe to keep a ſolemne Feaſt, for the honour of their Patron and Founder: with great joy and acclamations, ſinging of Anthems, drinking of Healths and ſhooting off divers great peeces of Ordnance which they had planted upon the top of a hill cloſe by the City) congratulate and give thanks to God for the happy converſion of the King of <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>Thirdly, for we will ſpeak no more of this ſecond Queſtion, doth your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and Aſſociates think, that the Presbyteriall government (if you ſhould forſake the other) will be prejudiciall to Monarchy? Surely, howſoever your Prelates have ſcandalized and ſpoken ill of that way, calling the followers and profeſſours thereof, and that in an ill ſence, and that by way of obloquy; Puritans: yet (if our obſervation fail not in moſt parts of Chriſtendome (which ſome of us have ſurveyed; and ſo have few or none of your Engliſh Prelats, or Dirgy-men: For as we underſtand, they are none of the greateſt Travellers, they think this qualitie no ways ſutable to their <hi>grandeur,</hi> and therefore leave it to Seamen, or others of a meaner condition: and ſo receive all things willingly (which they are to know or ſpeak of, of other Nations) at the ſecond hand.

For let a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant King (we mean one that rules over a people of that profeſſion) be never ſo notoriouſly wicked in his perſon, and enormious in his government: let him ſtamp vice with his example, and make it currant by being his, let him remove the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient bound-marks of lawfull Sovereignty, and every day make more yokes and

               <p>And to this purpoſe, wee cannot admire enough of your Highneſſe, and your Great Councell, that you ſhould take ſo ſhall notice of the Spaniſh King, and the German Emperour, who are ſo faſt vying ſtakes with the French King which of them ſhould ſooneſt by this means engroſſe unto themſelves the European States, and erect a Catholike Chriſtian Monarchie, to which purpoſe, they omit no way or means to make the Proteſtant Princes and States fall by the eares together, and keep their Houſes and Territoires in perpetuall diviſion.

               <p>The third motive to induce your Highneſſe unto peace, is the Obligation which God and Nature hath laid upon you, to mayntain the Rights of your Siſter and Nephews, whoſe parents, if they had been either Papiſts or Neuterals, might have this day been ſitting in their Caſtle or <hi>Wittenbergh.</hi> For although ambition, was the cauſe pretended; yet who knoweth not that knoweth any thing? that their Religion was the cauſe intended. For had they complyed ſo much as ſome other Princes do that beare the name of Proteſtants (with the Spaniſh King, and the <hi>Germane</hi> Emperour) neither had their Confederates ſo miſerably flinched from them us they did, nor they liad been ſo rigidly and cruelly ejected out of their own inheritante us they were. But becauſe Gods judgments are unſearchable, and his ways paſt finding out; for, who knoweth Gods mind? or who hath

               <p>But if wilfulneſſe and prejudicacie have ſo much prepoſeſſed you, and your aſſociates, that you will not thinke of any other or better way to prevent your own and your Kinſmens ruine, then that which you have now in hand: Wee have no more to ſay to you but what <hi>Mordecay</hi> ſaid to <hi>Eſter, Eſter.</hi> 4. 13. <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance will be brought another way:</hi> For as God is true, you will finde this cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that ſo many of your kindred, and other Proteſtant Princes and States that doe juſtly ſuffer for the cauſe of Religion if they perſevere unto the end) God will exalt and raiſe them by the ſame Religion and work their deliverance by no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther means then by the ſame whereby they have ſuffered.</p>
               <p>The fourth and laſt motive, which we ſhall mention at this time, is the duty, which by the Law of God you owe to your people, which is to ſhew your chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt care, and uſe your beſt means, for the preſervation of their lives and liberties, eſpecially, ſeeing they are all members of that politicall body whereof your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe proſeſſeth your ſelfe to be the head, and ſeeing alſo that in them, <hi>viz.</hi> in then good affections, health and welfare, doth conſiſt (as <hi>Samſons</hi> did in his locks)
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:113147:10"/>
your great ſtrength and livelihood. For if there be a ſympathy and fellow-feeling, in the body naturall, in ſo much as when the foot is trod upon, or any other mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber hurt, the head will complain, as if the injury were done unto it and ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in the true Church of Chriſt, or body myſticall (as the Apoſtle emplyeth when he biddeth <hi>us rejoyce with them that rejoyce, and weep with them that weep:</hi> Rom. 12. 15. <hi>And be like affectioned one towards another.</hi> And again, <hi>Who is weak and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?</hi> if (wee ſay) there is ſuch a ſympathy in the myſticall and naturall body, why ſhould not the ſame be alſo in the body politicall? if therefore any, or many members of the body of <hi>Great Britain.</hi> be diſeaſed or diſtempered through malignant humours, which may perhaps, not onely work obſtructions in the pipes of government, but alſo make the head complain, and cry out for pain; yet are not theſe members (by war or any other means of this nature to be cut off from the head, unleſſe they prove ſo poyſoned putrified, and gangrened; that they are deſtructive to the whole body. But God be thanked Sir, the humours of your people are not yet ſo deſperate, but that if your Highneſſe (like a good Phiſician) will vouchſafe in love to viſit them, feel their pulſes, and apply unto them a doſis or potion ſutable to their diſtempers, they may be eaſily, both cured and qualified: but as for the medicine which you have applyed to them hither-tils, (if we be not much miſtaken; the ingredients thereof have been too ſharp, and if you give them any more of it, you are like to marre all.) For there be ſome humours and diſeaſes that are ſooner expelled and cured by lenatives then by coraſives by gentle potionsr then by ſharp purgations: and ſuch are theſe of the Inhabitants of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> both <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Engliſh;</hi> but eſpecially the <hi>Scots,</hi> whom I cannot more fitly compare then to a Cannon bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, which is dinted and quelled with the leaſt ſoftneſſe, and is never ſo rigid and piercing, then when it is moſt reſiſted would you therefore have the peoples ſore healed? why then, Sir, correct your phyſick, this plaiſter of war is too coraſive; <hi>Bellona</hi> ſhould be a Kings <hi>ultimum refugium,</hi> his laſt, becauſe his worſt refuge; Be therefore perſwaded by us, that whoſoever did firſt perſwade your Highneſſe to this courſe, had as good adviſed you to tread upon a thorn, or put your hand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Waſps neſt. For when you conceived, White Hall to be on fire, they did what they could to adde fuell to the flames, and caſt on faggots when your houſe was burning, making the rent greater, and the wound deeper; and conſequently the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy worſe then the diſeaſe. As therefore your Highneſſe doth tender your own Honour and ſafety, welfare of your Children, and Friends, and proſperity of your people (if it be poſſible) and as much as you can divert from them this courſe of war. Remember that God will require the life of a man at the Hands of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and if of a brother; much more of a father. <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 5 For a King is the nurſing Father of Gods people; take from hence-forth a preciſe account of the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:113147:11"/>
death of your meaneſt ſubject; and let his bloud and life be precious unto you. Seeing that <hi>homo quilibet, eſt pars communitatis:</hi> every particular perſon is part of the whole State; a Subject of one Kingdom, and <note place="margin">

Otherwiſe it is a dangerous ſymptome that the body of theſe Kingdoms is pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie-ſtricken, or at the leaſt ſome Lethargy or mortall ſickneſſe is approching, to it, which rendreth it both inſenſible and incurable.</p>
               <p>The fourth and laſt queſtion is, what is the beſt means or which may be the chiefeſt preparatives for your Highneſſe and your Aſſociates to obtaine an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and laſting peace.</p>
               <p>We ſhall in this point alſo endevour to give you ſatisfaction if either you will follow our advice, or receive the ſame without partiality or prejudice. And firſt, we ſay, that the beſt way to a firme and honourable peace is by the work of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, <hi>For the work of righteouſneſſe is peace, and the effect thereof ioy and aſſurance for ever:</hi> as the Prophet ſpeaketh, <hi>Eſay</hi> 32, 17. Where by the work of righteouſneſſe, wee doe not ſo much underſtand that imputed righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, which is truly and properly inherent in him, but ſo made our by faith, that God doth accept of us as righteous for his ſake, as if this righteouſneſſe were properly and truly inherent in our ſelves, which is called <hi>the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of faith, Rom.</hi> 1. 17. and <hi>the righteouſneſſe of the Kingdome of God, Matth.</hi> 6. 33. nor by this work of Righteouſneſſe doe wee underſtand altogether thut actuall righteouſneſſe which is to be performed by us: whereby we ſhew the truth of our faith, by the works of piety, charity, humility &amp;c. (although the words may admit either of theſe without prejudice) but by the work of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe we conceive principally, an habituall diſpoſition and inclination, both to practiſe and affect things that are good and righteous: in a word wee mean no otherwiſe then that your Highneſſe would withdraw and alienate your affections from unjuſt and unrighteous perſons. Offices and Officers, who have theſe many yeers paſt mayntained, and ſtill hope to mayntaine themſelves by the ruine of the Church and Common-wealth, who (like ſo many Syrens) have ſo long and ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably inveighled you; and by their <hi>Circean</hi> inchantments, moved you to preſſe that prerogative (which the Almighty gave you for the preſervation and welfare of the people) and that both in Church and State Affairs; ſo much and ſo far as that whereas it ſhould have been as a Diamond in your Crowne, to honour and adorn you, they have made it by their Sophiſticall and Machiavilick inſinuations, as a prick in your ſide, or a thorn in your foot, to hurt and miſchief you.</p>
               <p>May it therefore pleaſe your Highneſſe, to let this be the firſt preparative to an honourable and happy peace, even to withdaw your Royall perſon and favour
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:113147:11"/>
from the contagious company of ſuch flattering Sycophants; that from hence-forth you may not onely profeſſe, but practice that part of the Royall Motto; <hi>Salus Populi, ſuprema Lex:</hi> And to this purpoſe, becauſe your Great Counſell of State are now about a work of Reformation, let not your Highneſſe fail to comply with them in the ſame, then which you ſhall finde nothing more pleaſing to God, and profitable to your ſelf, and that in theſe two things, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, in contenting your ſelf with ſuch a competency of Royall Priviledges, Revenues, and Prerogative, as may be moſt conſiſtent with the truth and purity of that Religion which you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe; manners of the Country, and affections of your Subjects, ſhewing rather a royall and Chriſtian moderation, then an imperious and inſatiable ambition: and (ſo you may enjoy it peaceably and comfortably) thinke your ſelf-ſufficiently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched, although you have no more for the preſent then what is ſhared out for you by the providence of God, and love of the people; yea, although it were much leſſe (eſpecially, <hi>rebus ſic ſtantibus,</hi> then was left you by your royall Progenitours. For what greater happineſſe can come to a King then contentment, who is never more excellent and commendable, then when his affections are moſt moderated; and what contentment can your Highneſſe want (when, if complying to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion and diſpoſition of your politicall body) you continue to be the head of ſuch a wiſe, noble, and godly Nation; to ſway the Scepters of three almoſt Angelick Kingdoms in one City, whereof there is to be found more wealth, luſtre, beauty: Prudence Temperance, Juſtice, Valour; and finally, all the delights of the ſonnes of men: then the Emperour of <hi>Muſcovia,</hi> and divers others great Potentates can command within the Circumference of their vaſt Dominions. Happy therefore is that Prince, who knowing that he cannot have all contenteth himſelf with a part, even with ſuch a part as he may quietly and honourably poſſeſſe with the ſuffrages of his people; for if the greedy appetite be not ſatiated, a poore ſhepherd ſhall finde more hearts caſe in a beggars cottage then a great Emperour (if ambitious) in a Princely Palace. Let Kings therefore conſider, that the more they abound with worldly wealth: the more doe abound their cares, for when goods increaſe, they are increaſed that eat them; and the beſt way for a King to be rich is to know when he hath enough: and not to improve his revenues through pilling and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his Subjects by ſordid and unneceſſary Taxations and Monopolies, for here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hee doth not ſtrengthen his Crowne, but bewray his tyranny, nor increaſe his honour; but call in queſtion that love which he oweth to his people.</p>
               <p>O what great grief it is to loyall and loving Subjects, to ſee their Sovereigne un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe himſelf, for the enriching a company of unworthy, temporizing, and ſelf-ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Paraſites? Who perhaps (if his back ſhould be at the wall) would turn their backs upon him, and like a ſhadow, follow him no longer then the Sun ſhineth,

or if he ſhould ſtand in need of their counſell, could give him none better then that of <hi>Achitophel.</hi> That any Prince ſhould thus miſtarry, is grievous and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; but for ſuch a King as your Highneſſe ſhould be who have ſo often ſmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted through the Machiavillick impoſtures of the <hi>Roman</hi> Antichriſt and his Abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; for ſuch kind of men: expoſe yourſelf, your poſterity and Crowns to ſuch extream exigencies. <hi>Quis talia fando, temp<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Secondly, for the obtaining an honourable and laſting peace, and performing this work of righteouſneſſe, your Highneſſe muſt look well to the rightneſſe of Religion <hi>viz.</hi> that the Religion which you eſtabliſh be made choice of not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as to the eye it ſeemeth gayeſt, but as it is moſt free from, and moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all corruption of mans life and manners, ſuch as is grounded, not upon mens invention, but divine direction: That your Highneſſe give way to ſuch a kinde of divine worſhip as is not according to the nature and will of man but according to the will of God who being a Spirit loveth beſt to be worſhiped in ſpirit and truth, and not in or by any painted or graven images, outward pomps,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:113147:12"/>
gaudie cloaths or ſuperſtitious repreſentations of any thing that is in heaven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove or in earth beneath, ſuch as all falſe Religions abound withall, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hereticall and Idolatrous Prieſts, delude and dazle the eyes of ſimple people, who are naturally inclined to affect that ſooneſt which to the eye ſeemeth gayeſt, making them believe that theſe dumb ſhews and pictures, are lay mens books, in the mean time hiding from them the power of Chriſt in the work of the miniſtry.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing there is no difference between your Highneſſe and us in points of doctrine (the word of God being preached by us both in as great purity and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxneſſe as can be conſiſtent with a militant Church) our requeſt unto your Highneſſe is (as you tender either your own or our peace, to admit with us the ſame reformation and purity in matters of diſcipline, as is implyed in the premiſes for certainly Sir ſolong as the diſcipline of your Church remaineth unpurged, the members and profeſſors thereof can never properly be ſaid to be of the true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion: well they may be called Proteſtants, and ſaid to be of a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion, <hi>viz.</hi> comparatively as they have relation to <hi>Eutherans</hi> or <hi>Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luitans,</hi> or ſome other ſect of <hi>Proteſtaniſme</hi> but to be Proteſtants indeed, that is, true Proteſtants, of the true reformed Proteſtant Religion they cannot becauſe their Religion is reformed onely in part. <hi>viz.</hi> in matter of doctrine, the diſcipline remaining and being retained in the ſame corruption and ſuperſtition as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it from the Roman Church: whereas the true Proteſtant Religion exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Presbyteriall government is equally reformed as well in diſcipline as in doctrine, depencing abſolutely upon the word of God, without any exceſſive or ſcandalous mixture (other then accords with Chriſtian ſimplicity decencie, and charity) of humane inventions, or ſuperſtitious innovations: But if you Highneſſe will needs maintain ſome diſparity amongſt Miniſters, preferring ſome before o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who in reſpect of their eminent parts, may ſeem to deſerve better we will not diſcommend it providing that your Highneſſe remember well your Fathers Councell in his <hi>Baſilicon Doron, pag</hi> 44. <hi>viz.</hi> ſo to charge and change them with ſuch bonds as may preſerve them from creeping into corruption.</p>
               <p>A third mean to procure an honourable and laſting peace is to unite the people, as well as the Countreys of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> (which can never be effected by your Highneſſe ſo long as you ſtand in oppoſition to the Parliament; But and if you can be ſo happy as to come in then we conceive it may eaſily be wrought in this manner; <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, by making an univerſall act of oblivion in both Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for all Nationall quarrels and deadly feuds, which have been a prohibition from all, which in time to come may acrew betwixt the natives of either King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome by reaſon of any occurrence or paſſage of preceding or future times. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by aboliſhing the reſpective names of Engliſh or Scotiſh men; which
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:113147:13"/>
(in reſpect of the great controverſies and differences, which have been between the two Kingdoms) doe ſtill continue names of prejudice, to the great exaſperating of the affections of both ſides, and poſſeſſing them with rigid and implacable mindes, one againſt another, upon the leaſt and moſt ſlender occaſionall diſtaſtes, and that all the inhabitants of this one Iſland may be called by one name, of Eaſt, Weſt South or North Britains; with ſome aditionall title of the Shire or County, prefixed for diſinction ſake. Thirdly, by engaging an equall number of both Kingdoms in their fellowſhip at armes, in ſome publick and fortunate lawfull war, beyond the Seas, where their honour and danger may be equally divided, and no jealouſies, nor contention ariſe amongſt them, but of wel doing, certainly, one vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory obtained by the ſound valour of the Scots and Engliſh, (whereſoever it be, ſo it be not at home, let it be in <hi>Bohemia, France, Spain,</hi> or where your great Councell will think fiting) will make a ſtronger and more indiſſoluble knot of union both between them and your Highneſſe, and amongſt themſelves then ever your Highneſſe could make by chooſing your Minions alternatively out of each Nation, or by making Scotch men Lords of <hi>England;</hi> Engliſh men Lords of <hi>Scotland;</hi> or yet by mixture of marriage, for although marriage may make two perſons one, yet can it not make two people to be one; certainly, all theſe are too weak ingrediences to compound a love-potion for them that were wont to thirſt after one anothers blood, it muſt be ſomething more energeticall and vertuous that muſt qualifie and chain the different humors of theſe two Nations; and make them forget whoſe fortune it was to be envied, and whoſe to be contemned in times paſt; and to ſpeak ingenuouſly: never had King a fairer oportunity to effect this, as your Highneſſe hath now, all the Kingdoms in Chriſtendome almoſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now by the ears together, eſpecially if in this your day, your Highneſſe would <hi>reſipiſcere,</hi> and come to your ſelf, and ſo much tender your own health and welfare, as to apply unto your almoſt gangreen, and incurable wounds, a ſalving playſter of Parliamentary Union.</p>
