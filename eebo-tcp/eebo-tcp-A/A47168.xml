            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:60074:3"/>
but hints of what in larger variety of curious things, are more copiouſly incerted for the Accommodation of Young Gentlemen, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women, and others, done with that Care and Exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in all the many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, that without vain glory, I may preſume to ſay, that this, nor former A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges have not produced of theſe kinds any thing ſo cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and compact.</p>
            <p>It carries with it all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long as linked in a Chain, Pleaſure and Profit, and cannot but be grateful to the Fancies, eſpecially of the younger ſort, who put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

            <p>As for Limning or Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it has always been in high Eſteem with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt and moſt Honourable Perſons in the World, and is an Innocent and Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Recreation.

               <p>THE curious Art of Limn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Painting in Oil, has in all Ages been wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admited and approved, as the Maſter-piece of other Arts and Sciences, wherein Art ſo exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60074:5"/>
imitates Nature, that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only ſeems to be wanting; and many ſuch rare Pieces have been Drawn, that they have at the firſt bluſh deceived the Eyes of the Curious, who have taken them for real Living Beings, and though the Eye and Hand are mainly required herein, the one to direct, and the other to operate, yet the Mind or Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination muſt furniſh out a great part of the curioſity, having Ideas, or the true ſhape of things always in a readineſs.</p>
               <p>This cannot be done haſtily, but muſt be done by a ſteady practice and curious Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ons, and the firſt in this under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, is to prepare your ſelf with ſuitable materials, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others French Chalk Red and White, that it may be cut into curious taper Pencils, to Draw the out ſtrokes of any
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60074:5"/>
Figure you deſign, Sallow wood ſo burnt that you may do the like by it, and if theſe ſtrokes hit not at firſt to due propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they may be rubbed out with the Feather of a Mallard's Wing, and ſo till you find them right, then go over your ſtrokes with a ſtrong well pointed Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, either of Red or Black Lead: To make the Impreſſion more Even and Regular, it will be proper to have Pens made of Raven or Crow Quills to finiſh the finer ſtrokes, alſo a Rule and Compaſs with three feet, to take in and out at the points as you have occaſion, the one of White or Red Chalk, the other of Black Lead, and a third of any other Paſtile, and theſe in moſt Drawings are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to mark out equal diſtances after; the drawing of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrokes; there are other things
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60074:6"/>
required, which in their proper place I ſhall ſpeak of.</p>
               <p>Being thus far entred, come a little nearer to the Practice, and make your entrance on it with plain Geometrical Figures, ſuch as are the Circle, Square, Oval, Cone, Triangle, Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which at firſt uſe your ſelf to mark out with your Rule and Compaſs, till you can readily do it with your Hand, and theſe will much aſſiſt you in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this curious under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, the Circle well made will direct you in Orbicular forms, as the Globe of the Earth, Spherical World, Moon Sun, and the like; is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in confining the Picture you are to Copy; the Oval gives you directions for the Mouth and Face, the Foot of a Wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs, the Mouth of a Well, and the like; The Cone aſſiſts
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60074:6"/>
in Drawing Columns, Spires, top of Towers, Steeples, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Triangle is of admirable uſe in making the half Face; the Cylinder gives you aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in drawing Columns, Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, Pilaſters, and other things belonging to Architecture; the Poligon may be alſo uſed for Ground-Plats, Fortifications, &amp;c. and Angles and Arches in Proſpective.</p>
               <p>Theſe things premiſed, try to Draw ſeveral ſorts of Fruits and Flowers, as Grapes, Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Peaches, Apples, Apri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cots, Tulips, Pinks, &amp;c. alſo Inſects, Trees, Branches, and the like, and from theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to practice on Birds, Beaſts, &amp;c conſider well their propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, colour, ſlowneſs, ſwiſtneſs, fierceneſs, and many other things natural to them, and the better at firſt, till your Mind

                  <p>When you come to Draw a Face you muſt well weigh and conſider in what poſture it muſt be done, whether ſide-ways, upward, forward, or downward, touching lightly the Features, where the Noſe, Eyes, Mouth and Chin ought to ſtand, then go more perfectly over them, for the Circles, Squares, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60074:8"/>

                  <p>In a full Face, the diſtance between the Eyebrows, conſiſts of the length of one Eye, but where there is a ſide, or three quarters Face, the diſtance muſt
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60074:9"/>
be leſſened anſwerable to the proportion, the Noſtrils muſt be placed directly againſt the nether corner of the Eyes, and if the Face you Draw be Plump or Fat, the Cheeks muſt ſwell; but conſider, in a Lean Face the Jaw-bones ſtick out, and the Cheeks fall ſomewhat in.</p>
                  <p>In a ſmiling countenance, the Corners of the Mouth turn ſomewhat upwards, and in a ſour frowning countenance, the Forehead is bending, and Wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles appear on the upper part of the Noſe.</p>
                  <p>In Drawing a fore-right Face, you muſt make a perfect Oval, divided by two Lines in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to three equal proportions, in the firſt part place the Eyes, in the ſecond the Noſtrils, and in the third the Mouth, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Eyes an equal diſtance from each other.</p>

                  <p>To Draw the ſhortened or enclining Face, obſerve how the Lines agree, and ſo in their proper places you may Draw the Mouth and Noſe, and the reſt of the parts after you have brought your hand a little into practice; and note, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever proportion the Face bears, your out-ſtrokes muſt be form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed accordingly.</p>
                  <p>As for the Noſe, you muſt among other things, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly obſerve the roundneſs, hollowneſs, and Indentings of the Noſtrils.</p>

                  <p>This is a point nicely to be obſerved, or your labour and coſt may be in vain.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If you chuſe Wood that requires to be Varniſhed, let it
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60074:36"/>
be exempted from knots, very cloſe grained, ſmooth, clean, well ruſhed, and free from grea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſineſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As for your Colours and Blacks, lay them even and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitely ſmooth, ſweep all roughneſs off with your ruſh.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Keep your Work ever warm, but not hot to raiſe bliſters or crack it, which no thing but ſcraping off all the Varniſh can amend.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. After every diſtinct wash, let your work be thoroughly dry, for neglect in this point introduces the fault of rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. After it is Varniſhed, let it lye by and reſt as long as your conveniency will admit, and it will be the better.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Ever take care to begin your Varniſh ſtrokes in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Table, or what you
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60074:36"/>
do it on, and not from one end to the other, and your Bruſh being planted in the middle, ſtrike it to one end, then take it off, and fix it to the place you began at, ſo draw, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it to the other end, and ſo continue it till the whole plain be Varniſhed over, and beware you overlap not the Edges, which is, when the Varniſh hangs in ſplaſhes or drops on them; therefore to prevent it, draw your Bruſh gently once or twice againſt your Gally-pot ſide.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. When you have proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo far as to come to polliſh, let your Tripoly be very fine, and the finer the Work, let it be ſtill the finer, and uſe fine Rags, keeping your hand mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately hard upon it, and brighten or polliſh one place as much as you intend, e're you
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:60074:37"/>
leave it and paſs to another, and always have regard, that you polliſh your Work as ſmooth as you intend at one time, but if your conveniency will admit, let it reſt two or three days before you give the finiſhing ſtrokes after you have polliſhed it, but come not too near the Wood to make it thin and hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, for then it will require another Varniſh, or remain to your diſcredit.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Take a ſufficient quantity of Tripoly at the firſt polliſhing, till it begins to come ſmooth, and ſo leſſen by degrees, and carefully obſerve there be no ſcratches or grating in it.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. When you have a mind to clear up the Work, waſh off the Tripoly with a Spunge, and ſoak up the wet with a fair Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen Cloth, and with Lamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>black mixed with Oil, gently
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60074:37"/>
ſmeer the whole face of it, let no corner nor moulding of it eſcape, that the whole Piece may be freed, then with other Linnen, and a hard hand cleanſe it of that, and theſe things done there will be an admirable gloſs.</p>
                  <p>For white work, let your polliſhing be gentle and eaſie, do it nimbly, and clear it with Oil and fine Flower, and in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly obſerving theſe Rules you will prove an Artiſt.</p>
