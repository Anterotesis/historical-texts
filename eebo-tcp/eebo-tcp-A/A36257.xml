            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE Learned Author of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fowing Treatise, having read a Sermon, Preached at <hi>Tiverton,</hi> in the County of <hi>Devon, Concerning the Lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Use of Organs in the Christian Church,</hi> occasioned by the late Erecting of an Organ in the Church of that Parish; and the Answer to it, set forth by an unknown Author, entitled <hi>A Letter to a Friend in the Country, concerning the Use of Instrumental Musick, in the Worship of God,</hi> &amp;c. Wherein he found this Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of our Church, after a popular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner represented as <hi>Jewish</hi> and <hi>Popish,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with the Purity and Sincerity of the <hi>Gospel Worship,</hi> and introduced without sufficient Warrant, either from
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49804:3"/>
the Scripture, Apostolical Practice, or present Authority, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was concerned at the Abuse and Misrepresentation, having a just esteem for the Reformation, and for the <hi>English</hi> Constitution, which is by far the best Part of it, and so approved of, by the most eminent Foreign Divines, as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by their Opinions concerning it in the following Discourse.</p>
            <p>As to its being a perverse Imitation of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Practice, and inconsistent with the Purity and Simplicity of the Gospel Worship: He has so fully and closely Answered the Allegations of the Adversary, that 'twill be a vain Attempt to make a Reply to him. But from so silly, as well as false and groundless an Aspersion, as its being <hi>Popish,</hi> he thought it not worth the while to Write any thing in its Vindication, since 'tis no other than an old base and scandalous Objection, against the innocent Rites and Ceremonies <hi>of the Church of</hi> England, which has been Answered over and over again, to the Confusion, though not Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of a restless Party.</p>
            <p>However, since he was pleased to favour me with a Copy of his Treatise, which, it seems, partly through my Occasion and Request, but more through the Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49804:3"/>
and Solicitation of some Friends, he has oblig'd the World with, with Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to prefix a Preface to it, in Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of that Sermon, from the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persions and Mistakes, as well as Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>representations of the Answerer. I shall beg leave of the Reader, to detain him a little, from his perusing the Treatise it self, while I briefly Reply to his most material Objections, and rectifie some Mistakes and Abuses which will be found therein, in Defence of this innocent and useful Practice of our Church. But I shall not think my self obliged to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him in every needless Excursion from the Subject in Hand, into the whole Controversie between us and the Diffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; or throw away so much Time as it would take up, to Reply to every tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling or contemptible Remark, or those captious Questions which are made in it.</p>
            <p>The Answer seems so Artificially to be formed, that it may be read without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting the Sermon, or comparing them together, otherwise some imperfect Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and other abusive Reflections there in would be too apparent.</p>
            <p>And 'tis to be observed, That it sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses all along a Separation of <hi>Instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi> from <hi>Vocal Musick</hi> in the Service of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49804:4"/>
God; whereas, the drift of the <hi>Sermon,</hi> is to join them together, and to shew, That the one is more Orderly and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious and Beneficial for the other. And after all the tedious Harangue is made, there is no tolerable Reason given, why, if we do allow of <hi>Vocal Musick,</hi> we should not also allow <hi>Instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,</hi> which does so very much improve the same, and mainly conduce to chear the Mind, to excite the Aflections, to help out and assist the Voices, and to keep them from the greater Discord in our Devotion.</p>
            <p>But to be more particular, the Ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werer <note place="margin">Ans. p. 2.</note> begins with a fly but false Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion, to make it a little the more popular, <hi>That the Organ was Erected at a time when the Poor were ready to Starve, and when there was a stop put to Trade by the Prohibition of Clipt Money,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now in that very Year, when the <note place="margin">Anno. 1696.</note> Organ was Erected, the Poor had the most ample Provision made for them in the Parish of <hi>Tiverton,</hi> that ever they had. The Poors Book at that time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting to 946 <hi>l. 14 s. 4 d.</hi> ½, which was above 100 <hi>l.</hi> more than ever they had before in one Year: Besides, in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick standing Donations Yearly, they have about 400 <hi>l.</hi> more, and in private
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49804:4"/>
Charities very considerable to my own knowledge.</p>
            <p>Neither was the Erecting the Organ <note place="margin">Ans. p. 66.</note> any Expence at all to the Parish, as 'tis insinuated; for the far greater part of the Money risen to defray its Expence, was by Subscriptions; and the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part was taken out of Money in Arrears due for Church Rents, which without Sacrilege could not be employ'd but for the Churches use; and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a very decent one, and needing but little reparations, the Parishioners thought fit to employ a part of the Surplusage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Erecting of the Organ, which had been Sacrilegiously pulled down before.</p>
            <p>So likewise the Sallery of 30 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> for the <hi>Organist,</hi> goes Yearly out of certain Rents and Dues belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Church, without being a burden to the Parish.</p>
            <p>What the Answerer says concerning <note place="margin">Ans. p. 3. 4.</note> the Dedication to the Bishop of <hi>Exon,</hi> is very trifling, and needs no Reply.</p>
            <p>And his several times accusing the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the want of Charity, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many <hi>spightful Reflections upon Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ans. p. 24.</note> 
               <hi>Dissenters,</hi> is very groundless, for he cannot find any such thing through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Sermon, nor such Instances <hi>of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49804:5"/>
the eructation of his Gall,</hi> nor <hi>of the stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of his Spleen,</hi> in the Course of his Life, as he would insinuate.</p>
            <p>But methinks it should be very strange that the Answerer should accuse the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the want of Charity, or any one else, when his Pamphlet from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to the end, has so very little of it, 'tis scarce any thing else but a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Invective against the <hi>Church of</hi> England; and a scandalous Intimation, which is another way of accusing her, as being Popishly affected, and that her Rites and Ceremonies partake of the Innovations and Superstitions of the corrupt Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Abundance of this sort of Dirt is thrown upon her at every turn; but 'tis easily rub'd off. And tho' there is really nothing in the Accusation, nor any tolerable ground for such a Report, however it comes to pass, that among the unthinking, injudicious and deluded Multitude, it is frequently given cut as a popular Argument against any thing in the Service of our Church, which our Adversaries dislike, or rather, which they would seem to be offended at, more out of a pretence to keep up a Separation, than that any Offence can be justly taken at the things themselves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:49804:5"/>
And that this is no uncharitable or groundless surmise, is evident from their Aversion to Alterations, in the time of the Sessions of the last <hi>Convocation,</hi> as they were before in that of 1660. And the <hi>Conference at the Savoy,</hi> when they might have been satisfied in any thing, could they have agreed in what would have satisfied them; besides a total Subversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>English Constitution,</hi> which is at this time in an especial manner, and always has been since the Reformation, the greatest Bullwark of the Protestant Religion against Popery, of any in the whole Christian World. And 'twas sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apparent what great advances Popery made in the late times of Anarchy and Confusion, when this excellent Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was subverted, and thro' the Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> her most Zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Religious Defenders were tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd as Popishly affected, and by their Instigation cut off, because in truth they were the most irreconcilable Enemies to the Tyranny and Corruption of that Church, as any People whatsoever: Witness, besides the <hi>Royal Martyr</hi> himself, the incomparable Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud,</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Called by Mr. <hi>Long</hi> the Papists <hi>Scourge and Horrour.</hi>
               </note> who; if Times would have fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd him, had Zeal and Courage, and Learning, and Interest enough to have
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49804:6"/>
driven Popery out of any Kingdom in Christendom: And for certain the return of it in this Kingdom, will for ever be prevented, whatever is pretended by ill designing Men, if the <hi>Doctrine and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of our Church</hi> be but maintain'd with a like Resolution and Christian Bravery, as he maintained them, when he adorned the <hi>See of</hi> Canterbury.</p>
            <p>The sticking close to which, is the readiest Course that can be taken to keep out <hi>Popery,</hi> and nothing else will be able to do it. For notwithstanding the Out-cry of Popery be at every turn made against our Church Service, (which is one of the grossest and foulest Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that ever was invented or credited, and could proceed from nothing so much as an ill Design against her, <note n="*" place="margin">Nothing can make an honest Man suspect our Church of Popery but his Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance what Popery is. <hi>London Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</hi> p. 493.</note> or from great Ignorance of what Popery is) were this excellent Constitution destroy'd, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery in all probability would soon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the Protestant Religion quite, and we should be clearly over-run with the Tyranny, as well as Superstition of that corrupt Church, which at present do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineers over so great a part of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and threatens Ruin and Desolation to all the rest.</p>
            <p>We see too much what would be our own Case, by the barbarous Persecution
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49804:6"/>
of the Protestants in <hi>France, Savoy,</hi> &amp;c. notwithstanding the Edicts, and Oaths, and Declarations of those Princes to the contrary, if we should through the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> be perswaded by any of our Dissenters to alter our <hi>English</hi> Constitution, or so much as ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of the desired Comprehension, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the plausible pretence of Union; but in truth it would be a means of dividing and weakning us the more among our selves, than we could hope to win from abroad. 'Tis plain we might gratifie our Enemies thereby, but we should never oblige our Friends, nor strengthen our Interest, nor one jot the less be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniated as Popish.</p>
            <p>But that the Church of <hi>England</hi> is free from any such Imputation of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, is so clearly and candidly evinc'd by the learned Dr. <hi>Hooper, the present Dean of</hi> Canterbury, in his excellent Treatise on that Subject, at the end of the <hi>London Cases,</hi> that it will be needless for any one to say more to it; for those that will not be convinced of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary by his Reasons, do but expose their Ignorance to the World, or what is worse, their Prejudice or ill Design.</p>
            <p>Among other things, which some of those who dissent from us dislike, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49804:7"/>
against all Honesty and Reason make to be a part of Popery, is the Practice of <hi>Instrumental Musick</hi> in our Church Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: But 'tis a very ridiculous Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to say so, because the <hi>Church of</hi> Rome uses it, and very uncharitable and unjust; while the generality of <hi>Protestant Churches</hi> abroad (as well as ours at home) which are any where established, have the use of it, as well as that, and have had so ever since the Reformation. Our first Reformers were certainly wiser than to account that for Popish, and to be quite abolished, which was as useful then in the Christian Church as before, and which they did Reform where they found it grosly abused, but did never think fit to abolish the use of it, or account it a piece of Popery to be cast off.</p>
            <p>Those excellent Men were not possessed with such a Spirit of Opposition, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all Sense and Reason to run away from every thing in Divine Worship, which the Papists did use or allow; this would be bad indeed, and a much greater Errour than that which they pretend to avoid; for then they must disown God, and his Son our Saviour <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Papists believe them; then they must lay aside the <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> because the Papists maintain it; and have no <hi>Places,</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:49804:7"/>
nor <hi>Times</hi> set a part for divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, nor <hi>set Forms of Prayer</hi> to address themselves by to the great God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, because the Papists have them; nor indeed have any Decency or Comliness in the House of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause such are to be seen in the <hi>Church of</hi> Rome.</p>
            <p>No, 'tis the Corruptions and Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> we are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd from, and 'tis not requisite we should be still a Reforming what is thought Decent, Regular, Primitive and Edifying in our Church.</p>
            <p>And I Challenge any, even the most Bigotted <hi>Dissenters</hi> from the <hi>Church of England,</hi> to shew any one Superstitious Rite, or corrupt Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is allowed or maintained in our establish'd Church.</p>
            <p>They may accuse the <hi>Surplice</hi> for being such, but with what shew of Reason to satisfie an unprejudiced Man? Why, they may as well account a Black Gown to be Popish, or a Judges Scarlet, <hi>being the Grab of the Whore of</hi> Babylon; or <note place="margin">Rev. 17. 4.</note> a grey Cloak, because it is worn by some of the <hi>Friars.</hi> And so for the <note n="*" place="margin">This Sign, both <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> and St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low was u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from the time of the Apostles, &amp; continued in use in the time of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> the Great, and therefore could not be an Invention of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists. <hi>Opus.</hi> p. 326.

the Child which is Baptized, <hi>shall not be ashamed to confess the Faith of Christ crucified,</hi> &amp;c. is no more Popish than the speaking those Words is Popish; nor those decent and significant Rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, which our Church Governors have thought fit to appoint, for the more order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and solemn Performing the Service of God in his Church, are no more Popish than the Time and Place of Prayer, nor the kneeling at it; nor that very Form of Prayer which our Saviour taught his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. And the use of <hi>Instrumental Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick</hi> is no more Popish than the use of <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> is, since they are both made use of in the Protestant, as well as Popish Churches, and both for the same excellent Ends, namely, for the more lively and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate Praising of the Goodness of God, and the more effectual raising their Minds in Devotion towards him, as well as to regulate the Voices of the People, and to make them the more Harmonious.</p>
            <p>And nothing is more evident, than that the generality of Protestant Churches abroad, as well as ours at home, do use <hi>Instrumental</hi> as well as <hi>Vocal Musick</hi> in the Worship of God. I give Instances in <note place="margin">Serm. p. 13.</note> the <hi>Lutheran,</hi> as most of the Foreign are, which are planted in <hi>Germany,</hi> such as the Dominions of the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:49804:8"/>
the Duke of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> the House of <hi>Lunenburg,</hi> and many imperial Cities, in the large Territories of <hi>Denmark, Sweden, Poland, Russia,</hi> &amp;c. Also in the few Churches which were Reformed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Calvin's</hi> Model, in part of <hi>Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Holland.</hi> The Reformed in <hi>France</hi> I do not mention, because they have been all along so kept under, as not to be able to obtain an Establishment according to Primitive usage and their own Desire, otherwise they would have had the <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> and I Question not a like Decency in their Church Service, as other Reformed have.</p>
            <p>This they Zealously Petitioned for in the time of <hi>Cardinal Richlieus</hi> Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration. <note n="*" place="margin">The judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Foreign Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> p. 47.</note> But that great Minister was too Politick to admit of their Petition for an <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> foreseeing that such an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolical Institution, and those Decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in Divine Worship, would make their Church too Beautiful and Regular, and soon draw many from the <hi>Romish</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablishment to their Communion.</p>
            <p>Now this use of Instrumental Musick so universally obtaining in most, if not all National Protestant Churches, being a proper help to excite and enliven Mens Minds in Devotion, as well as to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late their Voices, as most unprejudic'd
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49804:9"/>
People find; it is no great matter if some few of singular Humours, and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable <note n="*" place="margin">Scrupulus est formido Temeraria, &amp; sine fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damento, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que adeo nou petest obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gare. <hi>Amesius de Consc.</hi> l. 1. 1. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Scruples</hi> are dissatisfied about it, and dislike such a Practice. For 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to please every Body in any one established Church whatsoever.</p>
            <p>The Rules for Decency, however In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent and Instructive, will not meet with such an universal Approbation but some will be prejudic'd against them, and then 'tis much, if through the Craft of others, they be not easily brought to dissent from them. There is scarce any one part of our Church Service, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so excellent and edifying, but some or other dislike it, and some dislike all; shall we therefore lay aside our <hi>Book of Common Prayer?</hi> 'Tis very unreasonable surely, unless there were a better sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted in its room; and such a one I believe, neither this Age nor the next will be able to produce.</p>
            <p>But to please whom shall we be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded to lay aside or alter our Church Service? Why, some few, who will not otherwise join with us therein. I am well satisfied could that heal or remove the <hi>Schism</hi> that is among us, it would have been done a long while since. But our Church Governours know too well, that the Spirit and Genius of the dissent,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49804:9"/>
is of such a Nature, that nothing will satisfie that Medly of People, and the different Parties concerned in it, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise their Charity is so great, that they would have condescended to the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the meanest Party. But then again, their Prudence does direct them to consider, there is a far greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of People, which make a more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Body of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> which would be offended if that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and this excellent Constitution were laid aside; and who then should be rather satisfied? Those who are for a regular and decent Church Service, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Primitive Pattern, as that of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is, or those who being Biassed by some unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Scruples oppose the same, and are really for no such thing.</p>
            <p>And what does it matter if some few inharmonious Souls do dislike the Organs in our Church, as some others through Prejudice dislike our Church Service; and both through extreme Ignorance, or an ill Design, account them Popery. Will it be reasonable to expect our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours should so far neglect their Duty to the Church, and their regard to the most considerable Body of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, to gratify these few, by altering
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49804:10"/>
the one, and laying aside of the other? When at the same time, by such a silly Objection of <hi>Popery,</hi> (which is given by many as a common Term of Reproach to any thing which they do not like in the Church) they must also accuse all Foreign Churches of the same Guilt, while all of them well approve of our <hi>Church Service,</hi> and of <hi>Instrumental Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick</hi> too. And it is very little to the purpose to Object against the universa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of this Approbation, as the <hi>Answerer</hi> does. Because some very considerable <note place="margin">Ans. p. 37.</note> 
               <hi>Dutch Churches</hi> have no <hi>Organs</hi> in them, as that at <hi>Leyden</hi> for Instance, and some others, <hi>though they may be supposed to be of Ability to procure them.</hi> But I am credibly inform'd, that there are Eight Churches in that City, and only one without Organs. Why, there are none in the <hi>Popes Chappel</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and yet this is no Argument that they are not approved of by the <hi>Pope</hi> in the <hi>Romish Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this Out-cry of <hi>Popery</hi> is nothing else but Artifice and Design against our Church, without any tolerable Reason, or justifiable Grounds to support the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, chiefly raised and fomented and encouraged by the Papists them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, that they may by means of that,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49804:10"/>
Slander, Distract and Divide us, and make us become an easier Prey to them. This is so very evident, that in that little <hi>Tract,</hi> called <hi>Foxes and Firebrands,</hi> set forth by Dr. <hi>Nalson,</hi> it is undeniably so. <note place="margin">Anno 1680.</note> 
               <hi>It being a Specimen of the Danger and Harmony of Popery and Separation; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is proved from undeniable matter of Fact and Reason, that Separation from the Church of</hi> England, <hi>is in the judgment of Papists, and by sad Experience, found the most Compendious way to introduce Popery, and to ruin the Protestant Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this means Popery does by degrees continually get Ground, and our Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants not uniting among themselves, for want of joining in our excellent Church Service, will not be able to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Progress of it for the future.</p>
            <p>And to speak freely, an ungrateful but certain Truth, I concur with some worthy Men in believing, <note n="*" place="margin">I have seen a <hi>MSS</hi> bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, which fully proves the matter of Fact, and it is hoped will shortly see the light.</note> 
               <hi>The Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Popery may be clearly laid at the Dissenters Door,</hi> and we have no reason to account any thing Popery in the Kingdom, nor to fear any Danger of it, but from those few who are professed Papists themselves, or such as too near agree with them in Principles and Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices, <note n="*" place="margin">Another <hi>MSS</hi> written in the time of Q. <hi>Eliz,</hi> called a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement to beware of the Puritans by the Papists, and of the Papists by the Puritans; discovering the great Coherence and agreement between both the Sects, in manifold and divers regardable both erroneous and perillous Positions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> See this at large, proved in the <hi>Compendious History of all the Popish and Fantical Plots and Conspiracies against the established Government in Church and State, in</hi> England, Scotland, <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>from the First of Queen</hi> Elizabeth, <hi>to</hi> 1684.

I mean the several Sects among us, which dissent from the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which Church is by far the greatest, if not the only Support of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Religion and Interest, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently the greatest Enemy the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has in the World.

            <p>This Church had beyond others of the Protestant Profession, a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in the Reformation, for when <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> who first began to reform the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and Corruptions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to separate from it, had made a great step that way; he not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding left a great many things unreformed, which were offensive and could not be justified by Primitive An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49804:11"/>
such as the two great <hi>number of Ceremonies,</hi> and almost all the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Worship in the <hi>Church of Rome; Auricular Confession,</hi> the use of <hi>Crucifixes</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The use of the Crucifix allowed by Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and called, <hi>Causa Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi> &amp;c.</note>

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49804:12"/>
he must not come near the <hi>Popish Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But yet he plainly approves of it, and <note place="margin">Calvinus in Libro de ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess. Reform. Ecclesiae.</note> very sharply rebuked those <hi>English Men</hi> who did dissent from it. <hi>If any</hi> (says he) <hi>be found, that do not reverence such an Hierarchy, (i. e.</hi> such as is in <hi>England) and subject themselves to the same with the lowest Obedience, I confess there is no</hi> Anathema, <hi>whereof he is not worthy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However his Model was never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> nor suited to it, and his assistance was not accepted by Arch-bishop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> who with Bishop <hi>Latimer,</hi> Bishop <hi>Ridly,</hi> Dr. <hi>Taylor,</hi> and our other worthy Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, had the Honour of <hi>Martyrdom,</hi> for the sake of that transcendent Part of the Reformation, which they had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished among us.</p>
            <p>This was so admirably well contriv'd as to be in the moderate way between that of <hi>Luther,</hi> and the other of <hi>Calvin.</hi> They did not carry matters so high, as this latter, by running from one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme to the other, That because the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was over-run with Abuses from the Hierarchy; and its Service burdened with a vast number of Ceremonies, and the outward Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Church, being so extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49804:12"/>
had almost destroyed the inward Beauty of it, and turned its Worship into Shew and Appearance, and made to affect more the outward Senses of the People than their Hearts and Minds; therefore he did not seek to reform those Abuses so much, as to destroy the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Government of the Church, and utterly to abolish all its Rites and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Which,</hi> says the Learned <hi>Puffendorf,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">In his Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to History, p. 406.</note> 
               <hi>proved a main Obstacle to the increase of the Protestant Religion, and caused an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version and Animosity in the common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple against that sort of Reformers, and increased their Zeal for that Religion which they had received from their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither did our Reformers fall so low in their establishing the <hi>Reformation,</hi> as <hi>Luther</hi> at first did, by retaining too much of the Popish Service, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very little Alterations in outward Matters. But they kept an excellent Mean, and a regular Disposition of the whole Constitution, according to Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive usage, before Popery had Corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it. Their Business was to Reform the Christian Church from Popish Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition and Error, and not to fashion it according to their own Humour and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49804:13"/>
Fancies, or for the pleasing of others, to make a direct Opposition to Popery the measure of the Reformation. But the Method they took, was by Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining into what was most agreeable to the Sense of the Scriptures, and the Opinion of the Primitive Church, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning those Rules for <hi>Deceny, Order</hi> and <hi>Edification,</hi> which these only recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in general to the Governours of the Church: But the particular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of such things, was left to their Prudence and Care, so as to fit particular People and Nations, only they were to be careful so to manage the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the Church, as not to do any thing in contradiction to those general Rules of the Apostle: <hi>Let all things be done unto edifying.</hi> And <hi>Let all things be</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. xiv. 26. 40.</note> 
               <hi>done Decently and in Order.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Agreeable to which, those excellent Men our <hi>English</hi> Reformers, settling the Doctrine, Discipline and Worship of our Church, did not fly so high, as not to allow the Papists to be right in any thing, nor go so low as to comply with them in any one Superstition and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, which two Extremes the other Reformers fell into, but ours keeping the middle way between them, did by their moderate and discreet Proceeding, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce

our incomparable Establishment, which we are now blessed withal, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond any other Protestant Church.</p>

            <p>So much I have thought fit to say in a general Vindication of our Churches Rites and Service, and the use of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental Musick,</hi> from the <hi>Imputation of Popery,</hi> because these things are many times hinted as suspected of it in the <hi>Answer.</hi> But I shall now attend to what it says more particularly.</p>
            <p>Several Pages are taken up with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks and Observations upon the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for this Practice, from the <hi>Light <note place="margin">Serm. p. 6.</note>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:49804:15"/>
of Nature,</hi> or the natural fitness of the thing: And for saying, <hi>The early and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral use of Instrumental Musick, seems to argue such a way of Worship to proceed from the Dictates of natural Religion.</hi> But methinks this obvious distinction will be able to Vindicate that Particular from so great a Clamour; and shew <note place="margin">Ans. p. 11.</note> the Instance is brought by the <hi>Answerer</hi> out of Dr. <hi>Taylors Ductor Dub.</hi> to be little to the purpose. That by the <hi>Light of Nature,</hi> or the <hi>Dictates of a natural Religion,</hi> I do not mean such a Primary, and Necessitous Preceptive Dictate, as is perpetually Obligatory upon all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and upon all Occasions, <hi>Necessitate Precepti,</hi> as the Phrase is; but that it is Secondarily so, and directive to all Nations: <hi>The natural fitness</hi> of Musick prompting them to the use of it, at least to a general Assent and Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the effect abundantly shews that it does.</p>
            <p>And to this agree the Writers which I have met with upon this Subject, Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> mentions how early it was used by <hi>Moses, Miriam</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Annot. in Ps. 150.</note> upon a Religious account. And as to the <hi>Heathen</hi> Practice, he quotes <hi>Homer,</hi> giving an account of the <hi>Greeks</hi> usage of <hi>Musick</hi> in the Praise of their Gods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:49804:16"/>
And just before he has these Words. <hi>The universal usage of</hi> Instrumental Musick, <hi>among all Nations that we read of, gives Cause much rather, to assign it a Place in the natural Religion, which the common Light of Reason directed all Civilized Nations to, in attributing Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to God, than to number it among the Ceremonies of the Mosaical Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Wetennal,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Cork</hi> speaks much to the same effect. To these I <note place="margin">Duty of sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Ch. <hi>2d. 3d,</hi> and <hi>4th.</hi>
               </note> add two others, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> calls it an <hi>Help partly Natural, and partly Artificial,</hi> And Dr. <hi>Hickman,</hi> in his Sermon at the <hi>Anniversary Feast of the Lovers of Musick,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">On St. <hi>Caeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias</hi> Day 1695. in Ps. 100. 1. p. 11, 12.</note> says, <hi>That God is to be Worshiped with solemn Musick, is so ancient and so univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal an Opinion, that it may well be looked upon, as one of the Prime Notions of a rational Soul, one of the fundamental Laws of Nature, which like the Worship of God it self, we receive not by Imitation, but by Instinct. It was not inculcated into us by Education, but we sucked it in at our very Birth, or rather it was infused in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us at our Creation. And as the Opinion, so the Practice of it is universal too, and therefore the</hi> Psalmist <hi>directs his Precept not to the peculiar Church of God, but to</hi> All Lands, to serve the Lord with glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49804:16"/>
and to come before his Presence with a Song.</p>
            <p>To which I will add the Words of a very eminently Learned Man, who speaking of <hi>Instrumental Musick,</hi> says, <hi>It has the Advantages of being Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by</hi> Natural Religion, <hi>and of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>

            </p>
            <p>I suppose I need not seek for better Authorities to justifie the drawing an Argument from the <hi>Light of Nature,</hi> for this Practice in the <hi>Christian Church.</hi> However, I can by no means allow the Case of <hi>Sacrifices, Dancing,</hi> and <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision,</hi>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> to be of a like validity in point of Argument, as he pretends: For, to his first Instance, in the Case of <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> I Reply, That tho' <hi>Sacrifices</hi> be disconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in the Times of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> because the use of them is abolished; and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their being abolish'd, is because of the great Sacrifice of our Saviour on the Cross, of which they were but so many Types and Figures. This Substance being come into the World, leaves no Reason for those things, which were but the Shadows of him to continue. The same Reason can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hold as to <hi>Instrumental Musick;</hi> which is granted by our Adversary, to have been established in the Worship of God
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49804:17"/>
under the Law. But we cannot find either any Reason for its discontiuance in the Times of the Gospel, or where the use of it is Abolish'd, or spoken against by our Saviour, or his <hi>Apostles,</hi> to warrant its being unlawful now: They all Communicated in the <hi>Jewish Church,</hi> where that was used. And as long as the use and expediency of it holds good, as it will do in all Ages, being an allowed proper Help to raise the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in Devotion; it is altogether as reasonable it should be continued in the Times of the Gospel, as well as it was under the Law. <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Dr.</hi> Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks <hi>Sermon at St.</hi> Pauls, Novem. 22. 1699.</note> There being such a Sympathy between Sounds and Passions, as are by Turns the Natural Effects and Causes of each other: And if so, then true Devotional Musick will excite or heighten our Devotional Passions, and for that Reason is to be continued still, while <hi>Sacrifices</hi> losing their proper use, are Abolished.</p>
            <p>His <hi>2d.</hi> Argument, to invalidate the use of <hi>Instrumental Musick,</hi> is by making it as lawful to justifie <hi>Dancing in the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ans. p. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Worship of God,</hi> as that. And the Reason he draws from the Antiquity of the one, as well as the other, because <hi>Miriam</hi>

               <hi>and the Women Danced,</hi> as well as plaid with Timbrels in the Service of God.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49804:17"/>
And <hi>David Danced before the Ark,</hi> and <note place="margin">9 Sam. 6, 14, Psal. 149. 3. 150. 4.</note> devout Men among Gods own People did <hi>Praise him in the Dance,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>They did so in their Processions, when they welcomed the Ark, which did sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie Gods Presence among them, at its being removed from one Place to another. And as they went to meet <hi>Saul,</hi> when they had the additional Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of being admitted among the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</p>
            <p>And since the Modes and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of Reverence in Devotion are alterable, so as they may serve particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Occasions, Where would the Absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity lie, if now, on some Solemnities, a Grave, Sober and Religious Dance was instituted and allowed by good Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity? Truly I do not see, neither does the <hi>Answerer</hi> advance any thing to prove it absurd, but by styling it a <hi>Capering Devotion,</hi> as among the <hi>Corybantes</hi> of old. And altho' he adds a Confidence of saying: <hi>That no Man of Thought will allow such a Conclusion to pass for Warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able:</hi> He may find the <hi>Author of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Treatise,</hi> who perhaps has as close and consistent Thoughts as any Man in the Kingdom, is of another Opinion, and gives such a Reason for it, as I
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:49804:18"/>
presume he will not be able to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute.</p>
            <p>His <hi>3d</hi> Argument is by making <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision</hi> as allowable now, as <hi>Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Musick, because of its Antiquity, and the general Consent of Nations for it.</hi> To which I reply, That tho' all or most Nations did use the Rite of <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision</hi> heretofore; and the <hi>Jews</hi> most particularly, having an express Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from God for it. As before <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Levit. xii. 3. Gen. xvii.</note> 
               <hi>the Father of the Faithful</hi> was enjoyned in it in token of the Covenant between God and his Seed; yet this was painful to the Flesh, far from being adapted to their Natural Tempers, as <hi>Musick</hi> was, only to be observed by a Temporary <hi>Command,</hi> and to last no longer than the <hi>Jewish State</hi> was to last.</p>
            <p>The Institution of which, was to give Admission to the <hi>Jewish</hi> Proselytes, and to distinguish them from other Nations, in imitation of which, the <hi>Egyptians, Phaenicians, Syrians, Arabians, AEthiopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and other <hi>Gentiles,</hi> might take up the same Practice, and yet be no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for its continuance still, neither does any one say, that I know, <hi>That consent of Nations is an Argument of validity, when it is nothing else but Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> and therefore the refutation of

Mr. <hi>N.</hi> from Dr. <hi>Taylors Duct. Dub.</hi> lib. <note place="margin">Ans. p. 11.</note> 2. p. 371. is very needless. For the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted Rite of <hi>Circumcision</hi> among the <hi>Jews,</hi> which might be imitated by the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> was to cease of course in the times of the Gospel, when another ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiating Rite, <hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>Baptism</hi> was appointed to succeed in its Place: But <hi>Instrumental Musick</hi> was not to cease, nor to have any other Rite to succeed it; neither was it made use of at that time in the <hi>Jewish</hi> State, or <hi>Heathen,</hi> nor since in the <hi>Christian,</hi> meerly because of the <hi>consent of Nations for it:</hi> But because it had the Institution of God at first, the prescriptions of all Ages since; no where forbidden; and by Experience found to be a great help to Devotion, being adapted to the Tempers of Men, and to which they have a natural In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination; wherefore it may be as useful and fit for the times of the Gospel as before; and being plainly practised by the generality of all Nations, <hi>Christian</hi> and <hi>Heathen,</hi> may without any false Logick be admitted as an Argument for an universal Practice, and for better Reasons to be observed than <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>2d</hi> Argument made use of, in Defence of the <hi>Organ,</hi> needs no Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49804:19"/>
from the Exceptions of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerer;</hi> neither do I see an Absurdity in saying, <hi>That the inspired Prophets in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd into the Church among the</hi> Jews, <hi>the use of such Instruments as were thought fit by them, being so Divinely Inspired,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Serm. p. 9.</note> 
               <hi>to raise the Spirit of Devotion among the People,</hi> &amp;c. Being so <hi>Divinely Inspired,</hi> shews sufficiently it was a Direction from God; and therefore he needed not have Carped at the Expression; <hi>[As were thought fit by them]</hi> had he not left out the following Words <hi>[being so Divinely Inspired].</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then for a sure Retreat, he says, <note place="margin">Ans. p. 12.</note> 
               <hi>Shew as a Command in the Gospel, for the use of Organs in publick Worship.</hi> So say the <hi>Anabaptists, Shews us a Text to command the Baptizing of Infants in the New Testament.</hi> And a Man who Marries one too near of Kin to him, may say the same thing, <hi>Shew me a Text in the New Testament against it.</hi> But I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a few Words will take off the edge of the Objection, and shew there is no need of a Text directly to command either of them. For the Reason of a Law continuing, and that Law being no where forbidden, either directly, or by necessary Consequence, it is still in force, and then the Conscience is bound
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49804:19"/>
to the observation of it, according to a known Rule of the Canonists, <hi>Ratio Legis est nexus Conscientiae.</hi> This is agreeable to the Practise of the Church in those several Instances, as well as that concerning <hi>Instrumental Musick.</hi> The admitting <hi>Infants</hi> into the <hi>Jewish</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gen. 17. 7. 9. Deut. 29. 10, 11, 12. Mat. 28. 19. Acts 2. 39.</note> 
               <hi>Covenant</hi> by <hi>Circumcision,</hi> was a positive Law of the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> and for the same Reason, <hi>Infants</hi> not being forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to be admitted into the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament <hi>Covenant</hi> by <hi>Baptism,</hi> are as ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of receiving the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism</hi> now, as they were of <hi>Circumcision</hi> then; the Reason of it being still the same. And if this way of arguing from Scripture by just and necessary Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence be not allow'd, then Infants are in a worse Condition since the coming of Christ, than they were before; and the Gospel Priviledges are now straiter and narrower to them than before, which is very absurd to affirm. So the State of <hi>Marriage within the Degrees and Limitations of</hi> Lev. 18, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is not expresly Commanded in the <hi>New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> yet is of force still, and the Reason of it is taken from the <hi>Old Test.</hi> because it remains still the same, the <hi>Old Testment,</hi> as to Moral Precepts, being as much the Object of our <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> as the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49804:20"/>
New: 'tis both together, and not one singly makes the Rule we are to walk by.</p>
            <p>In like manner <hi>Instrumental Musick</hi> in <note place="margin">1 Chron. 15. 16. 4. 25. 6. 2 Chron. 29. 25. Psal. 149. 3. 150. 4.</note> the Worship of God, being expresly Commanded in the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> and not being forbidden in the <hi>New,</hi> and there being still the same Reason for its continuance, does shew the Lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Expediency of it now, altho' there be no express Text for it in the New Testament. <hi>To exact a particular Command or Precept in Scripture for a Practice of this Nature, is as reasonable</hi> (says the Bishop of <hi>Cork) as to require</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Duty of Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>p.</hi> 403.</note> 
               <hi>a Text for having convenient Churches, or decent Places to assemble in, for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Seats in Churches, or Cushions to kneel or lean upon, or for any such useful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, and honest Advantage of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worship.</hi> So if we do not allow <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Burket</hi> of Infant Baptism, <hi>p.</hi> 8.</note> Scripture Consequences; * <hi>How shall we prove</hi> Women <hi>ought to receive the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lords Supper? or that the</hi> Sabbath <hi>is to be changed from the Seventh to the first Day of the Week,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>And tho' the Command was delivered by</hi> David <hi>and the Contemporary Prophets to the Nation of the</hi> Jews, <hi>yet it is obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory still, (at least by way of Direction to the Governours of the Church) in like State of Affairs, thro' all Ages and People, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Reasons hereof are not Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary, but likely to last as long as the World does.</hi> So we may make our Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to what St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> says as the <note place="margin">In Psal. 150.</note> Reason of it, with which agrees <hi>Clem.

Commanded rather than permitted, for the sake of Mens Weakness, to stir up their Minds to perform their external Worship with some Delight</hi>—. And as he goes on, <q>For that God had a Mind to bring them to a great deal of Diligence by such Allurements.

But the State of the Church did not admit of it at that time, when Christianity was under Persecution, nor <hi>Instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Musick,</hi> as the Answerer Mistakes <note place="margin">Ans. p. 18.</note> me, no more than the <hi>Jewish</hi> did, when under the <hi>Babylonish Captivity,</hi> they hung up their <hi>Harps upon the Willows,</hi> and <note place="margin">Psalm 137.</note> refused to Sing the Songs of <hi>Sion in a strange Land,</hi> to those who carried them away Captives.</p>
            <p>And 'tis no wonder, that in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Times of Christianity, there should be a discontinuance of it.

The</hi> Christian Church <hi>remained longer under Persecution and in an unsettled Condition; and hence it comes to pass, that as the Primitive Christians took up only the most simple way of Singing, such as their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition would admit, so the advances to Art were more leisarely, and came on by such gradations, as Providence has given way and occasion for.</hi>

               <hi>use of the Organ, with respect to the suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness of the Times, and usefulness of the Thing, does abundantly conduce.</hi> The latter part of the Sentence the Answerer <note place="margin">Ans. p. 41.</note> leaves out, and then he takes occasion most notably to descant upon his own Fancy. I shall not speak of the Fathers Allegorical Expositions of Ps. 150. with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Literal meaning sometimes, which the Answerer mentions in three Pages, because their Sentiments and <note place="margin">p. 20, 21, 22.</note> Mistakes in this Matter are Discoursed in the Treatise following. <hi>Clem.

particularly is observed some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, to have spoken against <hi>Church Musick,</hi> but he does it not in pursuance of the Principles of the Christian, but of a Philosophical Religion then in Vogue; somewhat like that of the <hi>Quietists,</hi> or of our <hi>Philadelphians,</hi> who are for a mental Religion, abstracted from all that is external or sensible.</p>
            <p>I come now to the next thing to be taken notice of, which is, <hi>The Antiquity of Instrumental Musick in the Christian Church.</hi> To say when, or by whom it was introduced therein at first, is not certainly known, and for that Reason it is thought to be the more Ancient and more Early received, for it being ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally used in Divine Worship by <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> it passed insensibly into the Practice of Christians, as many other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Customs, in which they were bred up, ordinarily did. But to make it savour of Popery, the Answerer likes those Authors who alledge it was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into the <hi>Christian Church</hi> by Pope <hi>Vitalian,</hi> about the Year 656, or rather, that it may not want the <hi>Mark of the Beast in the Revelations,</hi> it was say the <hi>Magdeburg Centuriators,</hi> A.

            <p>He is well pleased if it can be thought to be of Popish Extraction, therefore

               <hi>not of so early an use in the Christian Church.</hi> 'Tis no great matter who is of this Opinion, but there be Authors of good Credit, who make it to be of a much ancienter use by several Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies of Years.

               <hi>may and ought to look upon it, as the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of the first Christians, rather than their choice, and that they had not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal to be at the Charge of those Aids and Ornaments to their Religious Worship, rather than that they witheld the Expence because they thought it unlawful, or unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming their Assemblies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For no sooner did the Church begin to Flourish, but they grew into Use and Esteem: And we read of St.</hi> Ambrose, <hi>who lived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the latter end of the</hi> Fourth Century, <hi>soon after</hi> Constantines <hi>Time, that he</hi> 
               <note place="margin">A. C. 373.</note> 
               <hi>joined Instruments of Musick with the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Service in the Cathedral Church of</hi> Millan, <hi>where he was then Bishop; which Example of his was so well approv'd of, that by degrees it became the general Practice of other Churches thereabout, and has since obtained in almost all the Christian World besides.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:49804:23"/>
               <q>Others have referred this to another Cause namely, that as Inspiration in singing Psalms, (which was doubtless an extraordinary Gift common to the primitive Christians) began to cease, Instruments and Skill were brought in its Room, even as Learning and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Means took place instead of those extraordinary Gifts.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Bishop of <hi>Cork</hi> says, St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Chap. 2. p. 298.</note> 
               <hi>took up a more Artificial and Melodious way of Singing from the</hi> Easterlings.

            <p>In the time of St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> flourish'd St. <hi>Basil</hi> and St. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> who both mention the use of <hi>Instrumental Musick</hi> as Advantages to the Weak in Devotion, regarding humane Infirmity.

               <hi>Eusebius,</hi> mentions the use of Instrumental Musick in the Church for the same Reason which St. <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom</hi> and St. <hi>Basil</hi> did before; which Book is Confessed by all to be very Antient, and to be Writ, some say, in the <hi>Fourth Century,</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Cork</hi> says in the beginning of the Third. These Authorities must needs shew that Instrumental Musick was much earlier in the Churches Service than Pope <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talianes</hi> Time, and so could not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd by him.</p>
            <p>However, 'tis not to be expected we should find this Religious use in the very Primitive Times: But that can be no Objection against such an use of them now, for Christianity was not got then to that Height and Grandeur as to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of such an Ornament, and we need not stand much upon the early Use of it, since its sober use is of so great an Advantage in Christian Assemblies, now the Art is brought to a greater Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than formerly,. And since some Men of great Estates are at a vast Charge to adorn their Houses, and to have the helps of Musick for civil Purposes, it is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:49804:24"/>
unreasonable they should judge the Expence Burdensome in Sacred ones.</p>
            <p>Whensoever, or by whomsoever this Advantage was at first Introduced into the Christian Church, and made use of <hi>inter Sacra,</hi> it was certainly done out of a great deal of Wisdom, Zeal and Devotion. And they did therein, but that for which they had so good a President as <hi>David,</hi> who did the like in the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church, and what greatly tends to <hi>Edification.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>For Musick may be such, and of that Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy, as to carry the Mind as it were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Extasies, filling it with heavenly Joy for the Time, and in a manner severing it from the Body</hi> (as says our judicious Mr. <hi>Hooker) the Harmony of Sounds, if we</hi>

The Prophet</hi> David, <hi>having therefore singular Knowledge not in Poetry alone, but in Musick also, judged them both to be most
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:49804:25"/>
necessary for the House of God, and left behind him to that purpose, a number of Divinely Indited Poems, and farther added Melody both</hi> Vocal and Instrumental, <hi>for the raising up Mens Hearts, and sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their Affections towards God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And why may it not be still an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament to Gods Service, and an help to our Devotion, while it makes our Church an Emblem of the Heavenly Quire, which is represented as praising God after this manner, compare <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 2, 3. with 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 5, 42. It cannot be presumed we should have read in Holy Writ of <hi>Citharists</hi> and <hi>Harpers</hi> in <hi>Heaven,</hi> if such <hi>Instruments</hi> of Musick were offensive to God on Earth; or say there is no Musick in <hi>Heaven:</hi> Yet as one well observes, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is a kind of <hi>Heaven</hi> in Musick, and such as raiseth the Soul to Angelical Exaltations.</p>
            <p>
               <q>If the Temple Worship,</q> (says the <note place="margin">Serm. <hi>Nov.</hi> 22. 1699. p. 12. <hi>Is.</hi> 6. 1, 2, 3.</note> Reverend Dean of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> speaking of <hi>Isaiahs</hi> Vision just before) <q>be a fit precedent for the Worship of Angels, why may it not be a precedent for the Worship of Christians, whose Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship as pure and as Spiritual as it is, falls vastly short of Angelical Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:49804:25"/>
But yet observe what he said before; <hi>Musick whatever it be, or how well soever performed, is of no use or value in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but as it serves the true ends of Devotion</hi>—And again, <hi>All true Christian Worship, whatever the externals of it are, is the Worship of the Mind and Spirit. It is the Mind only that can praise God, tho' the Tongue must Sing his Praises. The best composed Hymns, the most musical Instruments, the most charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Voices, are but lifeless mechanical Sounds, till they are animated and inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Devotion of the Heart—As far as the Harmony of Voices, or</hi> Musical Instruments <hi>serve this end, of moving the Affections of the Mind towards God; they are excellent helps to Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and 'tis only their subserviency to the Devotion of the Mind, which gives them any value, or allows them any place in Religious Worship.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that we may speak against <hi>Vocal,</hi> as well as <hi>Instrumental Musick</hi> in the Service of God, if it does not help us in Devotion. And 'tis but a foolish Fancy, to think that <hi>Organical Musick</hi> is a part of <hi>Popery,</hi> for it is no more such than <hi>Singing</hi> is.</p>

            <p>Having now given some account of the early use of <hi>Instrumental Musick</hi> in the Christian Churches, and shewn, That it can neither be <hi>Popish</hi> nor <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish,</hi> tho used in the <hi>Jewish</hi> and <hi>Popish</hi> Worship. It was used in the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church, before Popery had currupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, and before the Reformation, and since, in almost all Nations and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.

               <hi>Luther</hi>'s Opinion was doubtless for <hi>Instrumental Musick,</hi> but he did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly declare for it at that very jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, when he began to separate from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and wrote his <hi>Formula miss. &amp; commun. pro Ecclesia</hi> Wittenberg, because he was not then clear, what in such outward Decencies he would have settled.</p>

               <hi>That</hi> Luther <hi>num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> Instrumental Musick <hi>amongst the Badges of</hi> Baal, which looks as if he was no Friend to this sort of Musick. But had he Quoted this Disciple of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> more fairly in this matter, and not left out what follows, I am inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to believe, he might have been of another Opinion: For, <hi>Luther</hi> having reckoned up a large Catalogue of Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in the Communion Service, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> calls <hi>Churches,</hi> and <hi>Altars,</hi> and <hi>Fonts,</hi> and <hi>Chalices,</hi> and <hi>Organs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Ensigns of</hi> Baal, but upon what account? He does not call them simply so, <hi>Sed si singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laris aliquis Cultus illis affingatur:</hi> But if there be any singular Worship as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to them, this quite alters the Case, and for the same Reason he may speak against <hi>Churches, Altars, Fonts,</hi> &amp;c. as well as against <hi>Organs,</hi> and so would any one, should they be made Idols of, and not as we say, only Utensils for the more orderly, comely and devout Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shiping of God. To which I will add what <hi>Sethus Calvisius</hi> Quotes him for, in <hi>Epist. ad Senselium Musicum. Plané judico, nec pudet asserere post Theologiam</hi>

               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:49804:29"/>
So for <hi>Calvin</hi>'s inconsistency in this matter; 'Tis apparent, that he some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times speaks favourably for it, when he says, <note n="*" place="margin">Com. in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.</note> 
               <hi>He doubted not at all, but the</hi> Christians <hi>from the very beginning, Imitated the</hi> Jewish <hi>Custom in Singing Psalms.</hi> Now that we know was with <hi>Instruments.</hi> And in his Comment on <hi>Col.</hi> 3. he says, <note n="*" place="margin">Psalmus est in quo Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinendo, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibetur Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicum ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quod Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum praeter Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guam.</note> 
               <hi>That it is the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Psalm, that in the Singing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, some</hi> Musical Instruments <hi>be joyned with the Voice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At other times he speaks against it, and reckons <hi>Instrumental Musick</hi> among the number of the legal Ceremonies, introduc'd into the Christian Church through inconsiderate Zeal, &amp;c. This certainly is an inconsistency with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. And from his Temper and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, it may without contempt be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Comment. in <hi>Ps.</hi> 33. 2.</note> said, That he was a Man of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate Heat and Passion, however great he was as to his Learning and Zeal, in carrying on the Work of the Reformation.</p>
            <p>And notwithstanding his Opinion, the primitive Christians in the main were of another, and did not think <hi>Instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Musick</hi> peculiar to the <hi>Jewish</hi> Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, and so might well be revived under Christianity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:49804:29"/>
Now the Followers of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> who in all probability, may be supposed to understand their Master's meaning best, have the general use of <hi>Instrumental Musick</hi> in their established Churches, as in <hi>Germany, Poland, Swede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Denmark, Switzerland, Holland,</hi> and others of the <hi>Helvetick Confession;</hi> as well as in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And tho' it cannot be supposed, that every Parish Church in those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, should be able to have so great an Advantage in the Worship of God; yet their Approbation and Desire of it, is sufficiently shewn by their union with the chief Towns and Cities, where in their respective Countries, their Abilities are great enough to procure it. <note n="*" place="margin">View of the Government <hi>&amp;c. p.</hi> 39.</note> Mr. <hi>Durel</hi> says, The Reformed <hi>Hungarian</hi> and <hi>Transilvanian</hi> Churches have them; and likewise <hi>Trumpets</hi> sounding at the Church-doors.</p>
            <p>If they have not in those in <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> the Reason of it is, <note place="margin">This is flatly denyed by the <hi>Ans.</hi> p. 43.</note> their unhappiness, being suppressed and kept under by the Papal Power.</p>
            <p>Than that it was not in <hi>Scotland,</hi> is no more to be wondered at now, than it was not in <hi>England</hi> in the long Rebellion; none I suppose, will take a President from them in Devotion, who have now

a third time since the Reformation, cast of almost all Decencies in Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and for about ten Years last past, have changed their Glory, from being an uniform Christian Church, (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Primitive and Apostolical Pattern) into the Novelty of a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Conventicle.

            </p>
            <p>But that new Establishment may not be design'd to stand long, being Built upon a bad Foundation: And I have been credibly Informed; tho' the <hi>Came<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronian</hi> Party have carried the Day, and got Presbytery to be for the present in the Nature of an Establishment; yet throughout the whole Kingdom, there is not one in Five approves of it, or one in Three is a Presbyterian; and among the civiliz'd Parts of it, not one in Ten; and of Persons of the best Quality and Education, not one in Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen. I shall conclude this Digression, in the Words of <note n="*" place="margin">See the Judgment of the Foreign Reformed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in a Letter to a Member of the House of</note>

And now with what Confidence can the <hi>Answerer</hi> say, that the <hi>Hungarian,</hi>

               <hi>Transilvanian, Helvetian,</hi> and all the Reformed Churches in <hi>Germany,</hi> are those that do Worship God without the use of Organs) When the direct contrary is as notoriously evident, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing can be. <hi>So true it is, that all</hi>

               </note> the Case of <hi>Elisha, That this sort of Musick was enjoyned then, for the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening of Devotion.</hi> And again, <hi>Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Musick was Commanded by God then and Blessed for the exciting of Mens Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in his Service now;</hi> if so 'tis ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry absurd to turn off the stress of the Argument upon the Divine Command as he does there, whereas 'tis as clear as the Sun, that the quickening of Mens Devotions, was by the means, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Design of <hi>Instrumental Musick,</hi> and not by the Divine Command which enjoyns it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> The Nature of the thing is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the same; if it had that Effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy under the Law, to quicken and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite Mens Affections in Devotion, as 'tis certain it had, and for that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49804:33"/>
was enjoyned by the Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, it has not altered its Nature since. And tho' it be granted, there is no express Command for it now, while there is none against it, and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and use of the thing still continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it may very well be allow'd and approv'd of, as serviceable for the same end.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>3dly.</hi> Matter of Fact is directly against this Allegation of the <hi>Answerer.</hi> For, to shew that the Design of the Organ in the <hi>Dutch</hi> Churches, is to raise Mens minds, and to quicken their Affections for Devotion, and not solely to regulate the Voices of the People, and to direct them in the Tune of the Psalm. It is noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously evident, as I have an Account from some who have Lived and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed among the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and their Neighbours for several Years, and found it to be their Practice. For the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans to Play their <hi>Voluntaries</hi> for an Hour commonly before the Service be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, and while the Congregation is filling; and then afterwards when the Organ stops, the People Sing a Psalm, and the Organ does not Play all that while to regulate their Voices, but did before to raise their Affections, and to chear their Minds for Devotion: This
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:49804:33"/>
is done particularly at the <hi>Hague,</hi> at <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterdam,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Durel</hi> nforms, us p. 38.</note> at <hi>Hambourg,</hi> &amp;c. At <hi>Hassen, they have a peculiar kind of alternation in Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Psalms. The</hi> Precentor, <hi>or Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Musick with his Scholars, who are like our Singing-Boys and Choristers, Sing out the first Verse, with all the People; then the Organs Play the second. The</hi> Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians <hi>and</hi> People <hi>sing the Third Verse as the First, the Organs Play the Fourth as the Second, Some such way they have at</hi> Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Cassel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In many of the <hi>Dutch Churches,</hi> for the Reasons aforesaid, is the Musick up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Bells; where they have Forty or Fifty in a Steeple, upon which they play some taking ravishing Tunes for an Hour or more together, before the Church Service begins, not so much for the calling the People together to their Devotion, because they are to be heard but a little way, being small and well tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for variety of Parts, to play several Lessons upon, according to the occasions of the Solemnity and the Seasons of the Year; but the better to fit them for their Devotion, and to strike a reverential awe upon them when they come to Church, to raise the Passions of Joy or Grief, to enliven their minds when dull
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49804:34"/>
and heavy, and to compose them when vain and roving, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next he says, <hi>It deserves Consideration, That Organs were introduced into the Dutch Churches by some Magistrates against the consent of the Ministers.</hi> If so, they shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a better regard to the welfare of the Churches than the Ministers did, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve Commendation for it. But doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less the <hi>Dutch Ministers,</hi> would never have Communicated with the <hi>Dutch Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates</hi> in their Churches, where <hi>Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Musick</hi> was generally used, if they had thought the use of it unlawful in the <hi>Christian Church;</hi> neither can we well suppose their <hi>Ecclesiastical Synods</hi> would ever have suffered <hi>it</hi> to continue so long as it has done, had they had any interest among their <hi>Magistrates</hi> or any <hi>Authority</hi> left in their <hi>own Churches,</hi> if they had not thought it <hi>Expedient</hi> also and <hi>use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> as well as <hi>Lawful</hi> in Holy offices, whatever is pretended by our Adversary to the contrary, to favour his dislike of the <hi>Dutch Magistrates,</hi> for their Adhering to so advantageous a practice, as <hi>he Saith</hi> against the consent of the <hi>Ministers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I need not now, as the <hi>Answer</hi> would <note place="margin">Ans. p. 39.</note> lead me, prove the <hi>Discipline</hi> of the <hi>Church of England</hi> exceeds that of the <hi>French Protestants Churches, the Dutch,

Scot</hi>'s, &amp;c. than I need prove the Sun shines at Noon day. And then touching <hi>the holiness of its Members in Life and Conversation.</hi> He seems very partial by insinuating as if the vast number <hi>of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched, Profane and Atheistical Sots,</hi> were of that Communion, and not among the Dissenters. Truly these are a great Scandal to any Party whatsoever, who profess so holy a Religion as the <hi>Christian:</hi> And I believe all Parties a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us need a great Reformation on that account, and have too little cause to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid each other. But yet I knew a very noted old <hi>Non-conformist</hi> Preacher in the <hi>West,</hi> who having sufficiently experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced the Practices of his own Party for along time, did some short time before his Death, advise his Children rather to trust a Church of <hi>England</hi> Man in Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than a Dissenter from it.</p>
            <p>The preceding Discourse I suppose suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently Vindicates the Sermon from the Exceptions of the <hi>Anonymous Letter</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten against it. I have answered the main Objections in the Argumentative part, and rectified several Misrepresentations and partial Quotations which are found there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.

to a much greater length; I fear it is too long already. The Arguments and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities I have brought together, do I hope, abundantly justifie the <hi>Lawfulness of Instrumental Musick in divine Offices</hi> to all unprejudiced Readers, and for others 'tis in vain to go about to perswade.</p>

               <hi>may express an hearty Joy, particularly by all sorts of Musick, by</hi> stringed Instruments, and Voices, and by Wind Instruments also; <hi>for Musick is the Gift of God, and tends not only to express, but to beget the Affection of Joy; it doth compose the Thoughts, calm the Mind, and put the Soul into a posture of grateful Seriousness, and therefore we shall find it of as early use in Divine Worship as any where else; and since all Ages have used it so, we may use it in more solemn Places, and on more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Occasions without just offence to any unprejudiced Persons, especially being Commanded in this and other places of Holy Scriptures.</hi>

               <hi>some have been more at discord with the Liturgy, because they find in Cathedrals, and other great Churches, the use of</hi> Musick both Vocal and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganical, <hi>have been applied to some parts of it; which certainly is as Lawful as any</hi> Meeter, Psalmody, Hymnology, or singing to Tunes; <hi>which was never questioned by learned and godly Men for lawful in the Worship of God, publick or private, especially that of Praising and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Thanks: Nay, there is no scruple but
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:49804:36"/>
that even in Prayer, and the deepest notes of that,</hi> viz. <hi>Penitentials, both Musick of Voice and Instruments may be so gravely and solemnly applied, as may very much fit the temper of Mens Spirits, and the Spirits of that Duty; when either sad and solemn with Grief, or chearful and exalted with Joy: Who doubts but</hi> David <hi>and the whole Church of the Jews served God in</hi> Spirit and in Truth, <hi>amidst those joyful and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious Noises, they used with Singers and Musical Instruments? The Gift and use of Musick is so sweet, so Angelical, so Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly and Divine, that it is pity God should not have the Glory and Honour of it in his Service, and the Church an holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable use of it. That such an Orient Pearl may not be used only in civil Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or abused in wanton Carols and vain Effusions, which is to put a Jewel in a Swines Snout: Certainly the Christian Church hath more cause to rejoice than the Jews had, and we see the Angels at Christ's Nativity began the Church Musick with the heavenly Quire.</hi> And having given his Judgment for some discreet Regulations of Church-Musick in the next Paragraph, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, <hi>It was only fit for those Mens rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to abandon Church-Musick, who inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to fill all things with the Alarms of War and Cries of Confusion.</hi>

But in requital for the Citation of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and the <hi>Assembly of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines</hi> for Instrumental Musick, he brings two Church-men <hi>directly against it,</hi> as he says.

               </note> Mr. <hi>Maxwel,</hi> and so can say but little to it; only I cannot imagine what those <hi>Reformed Divines are which he agrees with,</hi> that should say, <hi>Instrumental-Musick is neither a help to, nor a part of Divine or Ecclesiastical Worship.</hi> For I am sure, I have Impartially shewn in the foregoing Discourse, the most eminent and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Reformed <hi>Divines,</hi> both Foreign and Domestick to be of another Opinion, and therefore I may doubt of the fairness of the Quotation; or well suppose, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prejudice to the subject in Hand, that every individual Person of Note and Learning, may not have the same Sentiments and good Opinion of it which the generality have.</p>
            <p>And as for <hi>Bishop Taylor,</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Duct. Dub. l. 3. p. 670. Fourth Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> He is <hi>not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly against it,</hi> because he allows <hi>Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental-Musick may add some little advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to Singing,</hi> and in the same Page says, <hi>I cannot Condemn it, if it be used as an help to Psalmody.</hi> (But then indeed he says) <hi>It is more apt to change Religion into Air

            </p>
            <p>I shall not enlarge this Discourse by bringing more Authorities in Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the lawfulness of <hi>Instrumental-Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick</hi> in Christian Worship.

Neither shall I need farther to trouble my self with Answers to the Objections, which I also there mentioned, as commonly brought against Church Musick.</p>
            <p>But in Vindication of this Practise of our Holy Mother, the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Non habet Deum Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trem qui non habet Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siam Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trem. <hi>Cypr.</hi>
               </note> from those Four popular Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are made against it by the <note n="*" place="margin">Ans. p. 82, 83, and 84.</note> 
               <hi>Answerer.</hi> I shall give a brief, and I
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:49804:37"/>
hope a full and satisfactory Reply, and so conclude.</p>
            <p>One of these we are Threatned with before, and here at first reading being proposed with an Air of Considence in an Argumentative way, may deceive the unwary Reader, if he takes them upon Trust; but when examined into, will be found to be very fallacious, and to carry more of Popularity than Truth and Weight in them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>1st.</hi> of them is, <hi>That the use of</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Obj. 1.</note> Organs <hi>in Christian Assemblies for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worship, is Condemned as unlawful by the Book of</hi> Homilies. Now that it is so, is so far from <hi>being most plain,</hi> as he says, p. 82. That scarce any thing can be plainer to any one that heedfully reads that Homily <hi>of the Time and Place of Prayer,</hi> Part II. (out of which the Objection is made) but must see the true use of Organs in Divine Worship is not at all Condemned therein; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the great Abuse and Superstitious use of them, as supposed in the Times of of Popery, against which the Homily is mainly bent.</p>
            <p>This Abuse and Superstition, <hi>the Church of England</hi> is now sufficiently Reformed from; and being so, as it is plainly expressed in the Homily, it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:49804:38"/>
evident, that the use of Organs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other things there mentioned, is so far from being Abolished by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, or disliked by the Composers of the Book of Homilies, that they are by the very same Homily, which is Quoted by our Adversary, adjudged <hi>Decently to be retainedin the Church, as things that God is either Honoured with, orhis People Edified by,</hi> which I hope, if made good, will clearly overthrow this the most formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable Objection against the use of Organs in the <hi>Church of England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us then attend the Place of the Homily, which is towards the latter end of it, and there we shall find, That after it has inveighed very severely against the many <hi>Corrupt, Superstitious and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Practices</hi> in the Church Service before the Reformation; as against the <hi>Images and Idols, and numbers of Altars, with an infinite number of Toys and Trifles, to make a goodly outward Shew,</hi> &amp;c. which it rightly accounts, <hi>a Mocking and Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming of Gods holy Ordinance:</hi> It comes at length to blame those who refused to frequent the <hi>Parish-Churches, because they were scoured of such Gay gazing Sights, as their gross Fantasie was delighted with, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they see the false Religion abandoned, and the true restored.</hi> This it does under the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:49804:38"/>
Representation of a Woman thus Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing her Neighbour on that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. <hi>Alas Gossip, what shall we now do at Church, since all the Saints are taken away, since all the goodly Sights we were wont to have are gone, since we cannot hear the like Piping, Singing, Chaunting, and Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the</hi> Organs <hi>that we could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which the Reply is, <hi>But, (dearly beloved) we ought greatly to Rejoyce, and give God thanks that our Churches are delivered out of all those things which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased God so sore, and filthily defiled his holy House and his Place of Prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where, observe, the Complaint of the Person, who refused to come to the Parish-Church, was not among other things, that there simply <hi>was no Playing upon the Organs there,</hi> as the <hi>Answerer</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ans. p. 82.</note> would insinuate, but expresly that there was not the <hi>Like</hi> Playing upon the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans.</hi> The Words are; <hi>Sence we cannot hear the like Piping, Singing, Chanting, and Playing upon the Organs that we could before.</hi> Where the Word <hi>[Like]</hi> being Craftily left out, the Sense and Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Homily is quite inverted. For the <hi>Like</hi> use of Singing, and Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Organs, most apparently refers to the superstitious Use, and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:49804:39"/>
Abuse of these things, which by the <hi>Reformation</hi> was clearly taken away; but the Discreet and Sober use of these in God's Service, was never absolutely Abolished, or ever accounted justly so to be; neither was it ever the Opinion of the <hi>Church of England</hi> in the Days of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> (or since) <hi>That Organs in Churches are displeasing to God, and filthily defiling his House,</hi> as 'tis untruly mentioned by the <hi>Answerer</hi> in two Places.</p>
            <p>For <hi>1st.</hi> In the Days of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> when these Homilies were Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, <note place="margin">Ans. p. 82. 83.</note> and ordered to be read in Churches, it is to be Noted, that the use of the <hi>Organ</hi> was allowed and approved of every where; and was in most <hi>Parish Churches</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> not only in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Towns, but in abundance of lesser ones, in some very small Parish-Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, where either pious Benefactors, or Peoples Abilities did reach to Maintain them; and this continued so, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out her long and happy Reign; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, in the Reigns of King <hi>James</hi> I. and King <hi>Charles</hi> I. which Practice is so manifest, that it cannot be denyed with any degree of Truth; which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly no body could suppose would have been, if it were the meaning of the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:49804:39"/>
Homily to Condemn them, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count them as <hi>Displeasing to God, and filthily defiling his House.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. It is also to be considered, That if we allow this Reasoning of the <hi>Answerer,</hi> from the Homily against the use of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, by the same we must argue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Singing too, for that is expresly mentioned with it. <hi>Since we cannot hear the like Piping, Singing, Chaunting, and Playing upon the Organs, that we could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</hi> Where the superstitious and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Use of either <hi>Singing</hi> or <hi>Playing</hi> upon the <hi>Organs,</hi> is only adjudged by the Church to be taken away and not the use of either, or both of them to be Abolished. And indeed I think not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from thence, but well nigh as much may be Objected on other accounts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Vocal,</hi> as against <hi>Instrumental-Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick</hi> in the Church, since both are equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly capable of Abuse: But yet both of them may be of excellent use, if Grave, Discreet, and Regular, and of singular ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage for the promoting the Praise of God, and the Edification of his People, when skilfully joyned together.</p>
            <p>And then III. The Opinion of the <hi>Church of England</hi> is the same as to this matter, with what I have said above, as will appear by consulting the subsequent
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:49804:40"/>
Words of the Homily, which are these—<q>This ought we greatly to Praise God for, That such Superstitious and Idolatrous manners, as were utterly nought and defaced God's Glory, are utterly Abolished, as they most justly deserved: And yet, those things that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God was Honoured with, or his People Edified, are decently retained, and in our Churches comely Practised.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Among which things, our Church does reckon the use of the <hi>Organ,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with God is honoured, and his People edified, and for those Reasons, <hi>was it decently retained, and in our Churches comely Practised,</hi> both at the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, when it Flourished as much as ever, and ever since when it did. 'Tis very strange now, that the Church Practice, which is so clear in this matter, should be so strangely misconstrued and misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented, as if it spake against the same thing, which it so decently retains and allows, and finds so great Benefit by.</p>
            <p>But to shew farther, That it cannot be the profest Judgment of our Church to Condemn the use of <hi>Organs</hi> in it, as the <hi>Answerer</hi> positively avers it is, from the <hi>Homily,</hi> altho the obsolete expression of its being delivered from Superstition
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:49804:40"/>
and abuse <hi>in the Place of Prayer,</hi> seems repugnant to its constant Practice: Take this short Story, <q>The Lord Chief Justice <hi>Cook,</hi> was made a <hi>Sheriff</hi> by King <hi>James 1st.</hi> with a design of Displeasure, and upon account of his being of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican Party. He to excuse himself insisted on a particular of the <hi>Sheriff</hi>'s Oath not then repealed, and perhaps not yet, whereby he was obliged to Prosecute the <hi>Lollards</hi> for Heresy. Will the Adversary therefore conclude that he was obliged to Prosecute the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants under a Protestant Govenment, and after so many Laws made in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Protestancy, only because this particular had escaped their observation and was not actually repealed? Could he think his not Prosecuting the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants prevaricating with the design of the Legislators, who had signified their sense by so many more and clearer Laws than were to the contrary? or could he think, that the sense of the Legis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators of the past Age were to over-rule the sense of the Legislators of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Age in a case of Contradiction?</q>
            </p>
            <p>His 2d. Objection is, <q>That if the <note place="margin">Obj. II.</note> Praising of God with <hi>Organs</hi> be thus Lawful in the Worship of God, then will it for the same Reason be Lawful
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:49804:41"/>
to introduce other Musical Instruments, in the Worship of God, as Harps, Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> The consequence of which is very true; and at present in some Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, there are such <hi>Stops,</hi> as represent <hi>Drums, Trumpets,</hi> and divers other sorts of <hi>Musick.</hi> And where is the Fault, that so useful an Art is now much improved beyond what it has been?</p>
            <p>
               <note n="*" place="margin">In his View of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment &amp; public wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God &amp;c. p. 39.</note> Dr. <hi>Durel</hi> informs us, <hi>That at</hi> Hes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen <hi>they Sing Anthems, not only with</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, <hi>but with loud Instruments, and</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olins too. <hi>At</hi> Bern <hi>they have</hi> Cornets, <hi>and</hi> Sacbuts, <hi>which Play in the Churches when they Sing the Psalms. Upon Festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val Days they have also</hi> Trumpets <hi>in</hi> Hungaria <hi>and</hi> Transilvania, <hi>which Play at the Church Door,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And what if our Church-Governours think fitting to introduce other Rites too? They may do so, keeping with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Apostles general Rules of <hi>Decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Order,</hi> and <hi>Edification,</hi> and yet not at all Act repugnant to the Nature of the Gospel Worship. For these Modes or <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 26. 40.</note> Circumstances of Worship being variable, may be altered with respectto different Times and Places.</p>
            <p>But yet I will not call their Piety <note place="margin">See the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> to the Book of <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> writ</note> and Prudence in Question; or be so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable to think, they will ever suffer

            <p>His 3d. Objection against <hi>Instrumental-Musick,</hi> is a <hi>Syllogism,</hi> wherein the <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor Proposition,</hi> upon which he lays the stress of his Argument is utterly false, and so being denyed, will let the whole fall to the ground. For, <hi>The granting</hi> Instrumental-Musick <hi>to be the most proper means to quicken our Hearts, and to raise our Affections, and to make us the more De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout in the Worshiping of God.</hi> Will not in the least impeach Christ and his Apostles of the want of Wisdom in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing provision for the Edification of the Church. Altho' we grant that they have not Instituted Instrumental-Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick in the Service of God, for the rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mens Affections, and quickning <note place="margin">Ans. p. 8<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

            <p>For the Institution of <hi>Vocal Musick,</hi> as well as <hi>Instrumental,</hi> was long before the Writing of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> and perhaps before the Writing of the <hi>Old.</hi> We read indeed of no particular Time,

            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Instruments</hi> must be owned to be helpful to Singing, where an unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Prejudice does not hinder the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding. Both were in use before the Law was given; as the <hi>Song of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> and the Practice of <hi>Miriam</hi> do testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie; but we have no Reason to think this was the first beginning of them, when the one Sung, and the other Plaid.</p>

Devotion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly consists in neither, not in the Voice or Musick, not in speaking or Singing, but in the Heart and Mind; the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of which are hereby raised, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by <hi>Vocal</hi> sometimes by <hi>Instrumental Musick,</hi> and most likely by both together, <hi>when meet Instruments are added to make up</hi>

               <hi>our devotional Passions;</hi> and make us more or less ardent and affectionate, as our Souls and Tempers are disposed, by being more or less freed from, or disturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with contrary Humors and Passions.</p>
            <p>His Fourth and last Objection has little <note place="margin">Object. 4.</note> of weight in it, but because he has a mind to ask the Author of the <hi>Sermon</hi> this Question; <hi>Whether according to the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:49804:43"/>
Act of Uniformity, and the Constitution of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>the particular Pastor of a Parochial Church is allowed to introduce new Rites or Modes of Worship into his Parish Church, over and above what are appointed,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I will give him this short and plain Answer, That I believe he has not: But then I must needs say the Question is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the Purpose, unless he can prove that the erecting of an Organ in a Parish Church where one formerly stood, and never was pulled down by lawful Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, is the introducing a new Rite or Mode of Worship, which I believe will be an hard task to do.</p>
            <p>'Tis certainly a very old Rite which is of more than a Thousand Years stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the <hi>Christan Church.</hi> And how long in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> I cannot tell, but we are sure it was a long time before the Reformation, and has conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued so ever since, while the Church stood.</p>
            <p>And the Prescription of so many Years, for such an use is a sufficient warrant for the doing of it, especially with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and approbation, and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Diocaesan,</hi> which is very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Constitution of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> The allowance of which,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:49804:43"/>
is as Authentick altogether as the <hi>Singing our Psalms in Meeter.</hi> And I heartily wish, when the expence of the War is over, that other <hi>Parishes</hi> who are of ability would follow so good an Example. I am very confident they will have the like Authority to countenance and encourage them, in so pious and Charitable a Design, which none I suppose will distrust the sufficiency of for their so doing. And I Question not but the benefit and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of it will abundantly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence them for their Charges and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in procuring and maintaining it. Our Experience herein must oblige us to acknowlege so clear a Truth. And I can with the greatst satisfaction say, That I verily believe since the late erecting of the <hi>Organ</hi> in our Parish-Church of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verton,</hi> and much by the means of it, we have as <hi>Regular and decent,</hi> and I hope as <hi>Devout</hi> a Congregation as any in the whole <hi>Diocess.</hi> And for <hi>Psalmody,</hi> I may be bold to say, much beyond any that I have been informed of.</p>
            <p>And now, I may presume the Reader will be convinced that tho' as the Answer says <hi>Something more has been said against the use of Organs</hi> in Sacris, <hi>than what is</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ans. p. 84.</note> 
               <hi>to be found among the Objections in the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's Sermon;</hi> yet a very mean Reply
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:49804:44"/>
which has been given by one, will shew that what has been farther and more closely Objected by the <hi>Answerer,</hi> does not at all invalidate the Lawfulness, Use and Advantages of <hi>them</hi> in the Christian Church.</p>
            <p>After all, I have one thing to Advertise the Reader, that to avoid prolixity as much as I well could, writing not a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Tract, but only a Preface to one; I have frequently in quoting the <hi>Answerer</hi> and other <hi>Authors</hi> not set down their words at large, but the Sense in brief, referring to them in the Margin; and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any the least design of Unfairness or Partiality. And in the whole I hope my unknown <hi>Adversary</hi> cannot say but I have treated him with all becoming Candor and Civility; I wish the <hi>Reader</hi> could say so too, having kept him so long from the following Treatise.</p>

The <hi>Apostles</hi> communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental-Musick</hi> after their declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against the <hi>obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saick Law</hi> on <hi>Gentile Proselytes;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could not thereby <hi>intend</hi> to <hi>condemn</hi> it as <hi>unlawful.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Church Musick</hi> now, I desire no more than what is notoriously true in <hi>Fact,</hi> and not denied by our <hi>Adversaries</hi> themselves, that it was <hi>actually</hi> practis'd among the <hi>Jews,</hi> at least in the <hi>Temple</hi> Worship, with their <hi>Sacrifices</hi> and Sacrifical <hi>Hymns.</hi> Hence I infer, That none who communicated in their <hi>Sacrifices</hi> and in <hi>Hymns</hi> Sung on those Occasions, could avoid <hi>Communicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> with the <hi>Instrumental Musick,</hi> to which those <hi>Hymns</hi> were Sung; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49804:47"/>

               <hi>necessary,</hi> if they will reason <hi>acurately.</hi> For this purpose, I shall desire them to remember, that the great dispute of the <hi>Apostolical</hi> Age, was concerning the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alition</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> and the <hi>uncircumcis'd Gentiles</hi> into one <hi>Society</hi> and <hi>Communion</hi> of Gods <hi>peculiar People,</hi> in order to the <hi>partaking</hi> of the same <hi>publick Worship on Earth,</hi> and their being thereby entitl'd to the <hi>Spiritual benefits</hi> promis'd by God, as his part of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> to that <hi>pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar People,</hi> which he was pleas'd to <hi>own</hi> as <hi>his,</hi> and to receive into his <hi>Covenant.</hi> For the Principal thing design'd in those <hi>new Revelations</hi> made to the <hi>Apostles</hi> in the Acts, was to shew that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were to be admitted into the new <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culium,</hi> without any <hi>Obligation</hi> to observe the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moses,</hi> as it had been <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly</hi> impos'd on the <hi>Jewish Nation.</hi> That is, without any <hi>Obligation</hi> to <hi>incorporate</hi> themselves into the <hi>particular</hi> Nation of the <hi>Jews.</hi> This God shew'd by his effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion <note place="margin">Acts x. 44.</note> of his <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> on <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his Companions, tho' <hi>uncircumcis'd,</hi> purpose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to let St. <hi>Peter</hi> know that they were not to be reputed as <hi>common</hi> and <hi>unclean,</hi> and <hi>uncapable</hi> of <hi>joyning</hi> in Holy Offices on the <hi>Terms</hi> of the new <hi>Peculium,</hi> on that account <hi>alone</hi> of their not being <hi>Circumcis'd,</hi> as St. <hi>Peter</hi> hath thought

before, when he saw the Vision of the <hi>unclean</hi> Beasts and <hi>Reptiles.</hi> The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of this, was not to assert their <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Holiness,</hi> or being <hi>actually</hi> of the new <hi>Peculium</hi> without <hi>Baptism,</hi> as many of our separating Adversaries have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood it.

            <p>NOW this <hi>Constitution</hi> of the <hi>new Pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium</hi>

into the <hi>Jewish Nation,</hi> and thereby made liable to all the <hi>Impositions</hi> on that <hi>Nation:</hi> And that by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press <hi>Command</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> who had <hi>exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> all <hi>uncircumcis'd</hi> Persons from par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of those <hi>Sacrifices</hi> of the <hi>Jewish Temple,</hi> and consequently from the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chetypal Heavenly Sacrifices</hi> represented by them, and from all the <hi>Mystical Benefits</hi> of the <hi>Archetypal Sacrifices</hi> which were apply'd to the <hi>Communicants</hi> in the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Sacrifices,</hi> as well as <hi>represented</hi> by them. By the <hi>new Covenant</hi> grounded on these <hi>new Revelations,</hi> the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were admitted into the <hi>new Peculium</hi> by <hi>Baptism</hi> immediately, without any Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to <hi>Circumcision,</hi> or to <hi>Incorporation</hi> into the <hi>Jewish Nation.</hi> Both of them therefore being confessedly <hi>divine</hi> esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishments, were to be receiv'd as far as they were consistent with each other. The <hi>first</hi> was to take <hi>Place</hi> confessedly till the <hi>second</hi> was introduced, because so long it had no <hi>Rival</hi> that might pretend <hi>equal Authority</hi> with its self. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards it was to give <hi>way</hi> on account of that <hi>general Authority</hi> every <hi>Legislative Power</hi> has to <hi>repeal</hi> its own <hi>Sanctions,</hi> and on the <hi>general</hi> account that where the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal</hi> is not <hi>express,</hi> the <hi>latter</hi> Sanction is to take Place, in Case of <hi>inconsistency,</hi> as
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49804:55"/>
being the <hi>Sense</hi> of the <hi>Legislative Power,</hi> at least from that time forwards. This could not have been Disputed, if the <hi>Jews</hi> had <hi>granted,</hi> that their own Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was <hi>design'd</hi> only for a <hi>time.</hi> But observing in the Old Testament, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent mention of an <hi>everlasting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> it was very natural for them to apply it to <hi>that</hi> of which they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready possess'd, and of which their <hi>Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> had given them so great an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. And when this Opinion had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, it was then very natural for them to gather farther, that God had thereby declared that their <hi>present</hi> Constitution should last for <hi>ever:</hi> and that therefore whosoever should pretend to <hi>repeal</hi> it, either <hi>wholly,</hi> or in any <hi>part,</hi> was for that reason to be presum'd not to be from <hi>God,</hi> because it was in their Opinion so contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his former express <hi>Declarations</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst any <hi>future</hi> Innovation. This Mistake therefore, the Christians of that <hi>Apostolical</hi> Age Dispute against.

the <hi>Holiness</hi> of the <hi>Seed</hi> of <hi>Baptis'd</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. So the <hi>Gospel Priesthood</hi> was not confin'd to the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> or the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of <hi>Aaron,</hi> as that was instead of which it was substituted. Yet in other things I have given instances of <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> from the <hi>Levitical</hi> to the <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Priesthood,</hi> allow'd by the <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Apostolical Persons.</hi> So the <hi>Eucharisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Sacrifice,</hi> in which <hi>Gentiles</hi> also might <hi>Communicate,</hi> succeeded the <hi>bloody Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices</hi> of the <hi>Temple,</hi> which had been <hi>appropriated</hi> to the <hi>Jews</hi> alone: Yet even here also St. <hi>Paul</hi> reasons from <hi>one</hi> to the <hi>other,</hi> 1 Cor. x. 18. and St. <hi>Clemens</hi> also in his unquestionable <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> None can doubt but the precept of not <hi>muzzling</hi> the <hi>Mouth</hi> of the Ox <hi>that trod out the Corn</hi> was <hi>Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi> and <hi>Temporary.</hi> Yet the <hi>Apostle</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues thence also, that the <hi>Presbyters</hi> also should <hi>partake</hi> in the <hi>Ecclesiastical Alms</hi> which they <hi>ministred</hi> to those who were to be <hi>maintain'd</hi> by them. If this way of arguing be design'd to prove a <hi>Duty</hi> in a matter so <hi>arbitrary</hi> as this is, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Persons</hi> who were to <hi>partake</hi> of the publick Contributions; it will follow that even in these abrogated Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, they still judged it to be the <hi>Divine</hi> Pleasure that the <hi>old</hi> Sanction
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49804:59"/>
should still continue, where the <hi>Reason</hi> holds the same. Had the <hi>Reasons</hi> been, without any regard to the <hi>Legislator,</hi> drawn from the <hi>nature</hi> of the things themselves; such might have prov'd the things rather <hi>Prudent</hi> than <hi>Obliging,</hi> and rather fit to be made <hi>Laws</hi> than to have <hi>had</hi> any Sanction from the <hi>former</hi> Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But the Reasoning here insisted on, why the <hi>Ox</hi> should not be <hi>muzzled</hi> when he trod out the <hi>Corn,</hi> is to shew the <hi>Sense</hi> of the <hi>Legislator. Doth God take care</hi>

               <hi>for Oxen? Or saith he it not for our sakes?</hi> Why so, if <hi>God</hi> had not been to have been regarded in the <hi>Duty</hi> here insist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on? If as a <hi>Law-maker,</hi> then even the <hi>Sanction</hi> will continue, by which such <hi>Laws</hi> as these obliged formerly: So they will still oblige as <hi>Laws,</hi> whilst the same <hi>reason</hi> continues for which <hi>God</hi> was at first pleas'd to <hi>impose</hi> them. If as an infallible <hi>Judge</hi> of <hi>Reason,</hi> still it will follow, that whilst the <hi>Reason</hi> holds, they will be so far from being made <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful,</hi> in such particulars wherein the <hi>Reason</hi> does indeed hold, that their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance will still be <hi>acceptable</hi> to God, tho' not <hi>commanded</hi> by him.

in the Days of the <hi>Apostles.</hi> And the use of <hi>Hymns</hi> neither is, nor can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by our Adversaries, as well in the <hi>private Synaxes</hi> of the <hi>Apostolical</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, as in the Worship of the <hi>Temple.</hi> The <hi>Hymn</hi> to <hi>Christ</hi> as a <hi>God,</hi> in <hi>Pliny,</hi> appeal'd to in the latter end of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <note place="margin">

               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:49804:61"/>
more readily and more vigorously than they would if they had not the assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a favourable <hi>Imagination;</hi> and that by the Nature of the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; and in that regard, <hi>Musick Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental</hi> also was acknowledged to have the same influence that <hi>Singing</hi> had by the <hi>Imagination</hi> over the <hi>Affections;</hi> and to <hi>add</hi> to the advantages of <hi>Singing Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally:</hi> So it was that <hi>David</hi>'s playing on the <hi>Harp</hi> cured <hi>Saul</hi> of the <hi>evil Spirit,</hi> by curing that <hi>Melancholy</hi> which <hi>disposed</hi> him to receive the Influences of the evil Spirit: So it was that the like use of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental Musick</hi> dispos'd <hi>Elisha</hi> for the Influences of the <hi>good Spirit,</hi> by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing that <hi>Passion</hi> which his <hi>Zeal</hi> against the Idolatry of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi> had put the Prophet into; it made him capable of being acted by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Prophesy.</hi> For chearfulness of Temper is one of the Dispositions required by the <hi>Rabinical Jews</hi> themselves, for fitting Men for <hi>Prophesie.</hi> That may possibly be the <hi>Reason</hi> why the <hi>Scriptures</hi> mention <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental Musick</hi> as receiv'd in the <hi>Schools</hi> of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> especially when they were actually <hi>Prophesying;</hi> as it should seem <note place="margin">1 Sam. x. 5. 1 Chr. xxv. 1.</note> to <hi>dispose</hi> them for the freer Influences of the <hi>Divine Spirit.</hi> The <hi>Singing Hymns</hi> to such <hi>Instruments</hi> is call'd <hi>Prophesying,</hi>

in the places now mention'd.

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49804:62"/>
               <hi>event,</hi> entirely to himself. So it was when he was pleas'd to restore the <hi>Sight</hi> of him that was <hi>born Blind,</hi> by anointing his Eyes with <hi>Clay:</hi> So when <hi>Naaman</hi> was to be Cured of his <hi>Leaprode</hi> by Wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Jordan,</hi> rather <hi>than</hi> in <hi>Abana</hi> and <hi>Pharpar,</hi> the Rivers of his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: So when he reduc'd the <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> of <hi>Gideon</hi>'s Army, from many <hi>Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands</hi> to 300. Here, on the contrary, those very means are us'd, which even the <hi>Heathens</hi> themselves had agreed on as most <hi>naturally</hi> conducive to the same <hi>end,</hi> and which least <hi>needed</hi> an <hi>extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary</hi> Interposition of <hi>Providence,</hi> in the <hi>Opinions</hi> of those who were to use them. It was easy to foresee that they would ascribe the <hi>event</hi> to the natural Course, of second <hi>Causes</hi> themselves, and that, in the <hi>way</hi> of <hi>reasoning</hi> suited to their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities, they would also think they had <hi>reason</hi> to do so, and that Gd <hi>intended</hi> they should do so, whilst he signified nothing to the contrary: And therefore God must have indeed intended they should think so, if he did at all intend they should understand him rightly. And who can think <hi>Sauls</hi> Servants par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly <hi>inspired</hi> when they recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a <hi>Musician</hi> to their Master, as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient against the Ailings caused by the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49804:63"/>
               <hi>evil Spirit?</hi> The reason in all likelihood why they recommended it, was because they knew it a likely Cure of <hi>Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and they believed withal, that when the <hi>Melancholy</hi> was cured, the <hi>evil Spirit</hi> who was confin'd to <hi>Rules,</hi> could not <hi>exercise</hi> his Malignity on a subject <hi>indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed</hi> to receive his Influences. This is a plain Account how the thing might be done, in their <hi>Opinions,</hi> by <hi>Instrumental Musick,</hi> as an <hi>ordinary means,</hi> without any pretence to <hi>Revelation,</hi> which they neither did, nor had any <hi>reason,</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to. The like Account seems most probable of the Case of <hi>Elisha,</hi> when he also made use of <hi>Instrumental Musick</hi> for <hi>disposing</hi> himself to receive the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Prophecy.</hi> He pretends no <hi>Revelation</hi> for it; nor indeed <hi>could</hi> he do so, if he was yet <hi>indispos'd</hi> for it, till he had us'd the remedy of <hi>Musick.</hi> For if he had been capable of <hi>Inspiration</hi> without the use of <hi>Musick,</hi> he might as easily have answered the <hi>principal</hi> Question demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of him, as have used one Revelation for an expedient to qualify him for a <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</hi> But it has appeared that the <hi>practice</hi> was already received in the <hi>Schools</hi> of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> which might easily put <hi>Elisha</hi> in mind of it, when he found his case re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired it. And for its being receiv'd in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49804:63"/>
those <hi>Schools,</hi> no <hi>divine Revelation</hi> is, that I know, so much as pretended. The most likely original therefore, is its <hi>natural</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duciveness to dispose the Mind for being acted by <hi>Prophetick</hi> Inspirations. The <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> used it for that end, purely on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of its <hi>natural</hi> usefulness for that purpose. The <hi>Priests</hi> of <hi>Cybele,</hi> the <hi>Galli,</hi> advanc'd their <hi>Enthusiasm</hi> by the use of <hi>Cymbals:</hi> So did the <hi>Bacchae</hi> in the Rites of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> who for the time were trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported besides themselves, and knew not what they did, so absolutely they were under the power of that emotion of Mind which they believed <hi>Prophetick.</hi> They brought themselves to that Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among other means, by this also of <hi>Instrumental Musick.</hi> The Passage of <hi>Nero,</hi> ridicul'd by <hi>Persius,</hi> is famous to this purpose: <hi>Torva Mimalloneis imple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt cornua bombis.</hi> To the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, I conceive, may be referr'd those Passages of the <hi>New Testament</hi> that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire our <hi>rejoicing always;</hi> that forbid our grieving, as well as <hi>quenching,</hi> of the <hi>Holy Spirit;</hi> that require perfect <hi>Concord</hi> between <hi>married</hi> Persons, that their <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> might not be <hi>hindred.</hi> By all these things it appears, that, in the received <hi>Opinions</hi> of those <hi>Ages, Cheerfulness</hi> of Temper was thought to <hi>dispose</hi> for the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49804:64"/>
Influences of the <hi>good Spirit,</hi> and <hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly</hi> for the Influences of the <hi>evil</hi> one; and that <hi>Musick Instrumental,</hi> as well as <hi>Vocal,</hi> contributed to promote that <hi>Cheerfulness,</hi> and to remove that <hi>Melancholy.</hi> These <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions,</hi> being <hi>supposed</hi> and <hi>alluded</hi> to in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> ought therefore to be taken for the measures of <hi>Interpreting</hi> them. And what is there in this Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis, that can, in Reason, be suppos'd <hi>Temporary?</hi> Can we suppose God to have made <hi>new Rules,</hi> for the Influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the two Spirits now, that were not in the Age of the Apostles? Or, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing the Rules the same, Can we suppose any Change in the Nature of Instrumental Musick, that may now make it unuseful, for those very same ends, for which it was then believ'd so very Advantageous?</p>

They might impress Ideas <hi>immediately</hi> upon our <hi>Imagination,</hi> if God had been pleased it should have been so. But that had been too great an Imposition upon our <hi>Humane Liberty.</hi> As for that <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate</hi> Conversation with them which <hi>separated Spirits</hi> have with each other, of that we are <hi>incapable</hi> whilst we our selves are in <hi>Bodies.</hi> Even our <hi>superiour</hi> Soul, uses the <hi>Imagination,</hi> and is inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable

of framing any <hi>distinct Ideas</hi> of things that are not <hi>Material.</hi> The way therefore remaining, how <hi>Spirits</hi> may Influence us, without <hi>violence</hi> to our <hi>Liberties,</hi> is by their <hi>Exciting</hi> or <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding</hi> Ideas already in us on fit <hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions,</hi> when external <hi>Objects</hi> are before us, that may <hi>Invite</hi> us to what is <hi>Good,</hi> or <hi>Insnare</hi> us to what is <hi>Evil.</hi> So the <hi>Inspiration</hi> of the <hi>Good Spirit,</hi> is call'd <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>Jews</hi> therefore do reasonably require in him who would be dispos'd for the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> of <hi>Prophecy,</hi> a lively <hi>Imagination,</hi> as well as a good <hi>Understanding.</hi> So that no <hi>good Man</hi> who wants either of them, is by his <hi>Goodness</hi> alone, dispos'd, as is requsite, for <hi>receiving</hi> the Gift of <hi>Prophecy.</hi> But the <hi>Imagination</hi> requisite for the Influences of the <hi>Good Spirit,</hi> was such as was Calm and Sedate, free from tumultuous <hi>Passions,</hi> and ungovern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>Fancies,</hi> and consistent with the most accurate use of <hi>Reasoning.</hi> This therefore was the Reason, why the first <hi>Christians</hi> imputed the <hi>Heathen</hi> Divinations of the <hi>Pythiae,</hi> the <hi>Sibyls,</hi> the <hi>Bacchae,</hi> &amp;c. rather to <hi>Enthusiasm</hi> and <hi>malignant Spirits,</hi> than to a Gift of truly <hi>Divine Prophecy,</hi> because of the Brutish <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sports,</hi> and indecent, undisciplin'd, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, into which those Persons were driven, when they surrendred themselves to the Conduct of those pretended Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. And what difficulty is there, why grave and grateful Tunes of <hi>(Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental</hi> as well as <hi>Vocal)</hi> Musick might not contribute to the allaying the <hi>Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and to invigorate the <hi>Imagination</hi> to such a degree, as would still be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with <hi>Decorum,</hi> and perfect <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection</hi> to the Nobler <hi>Faculties,</hi> which
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49804:66"/>
this Divine Principle kept in possession of their Native Right of Government? On the other side, the <hi>Evil Spirits</hi> were not believed, in the Apostles Days, so pure from <hi>Matter</hi> as they have been since the modern <hi>Aristotelean</hi> Philosophy, received at Second-hand from the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Arabians,</hi> has prevail'd. It was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Grossness</hi> of their <hi>Aërial Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> that was then thought to <hi>Confine</hi> them to these <hi>Aërial Regions,</hi> and to make them need the <hi>Nidour</hi> of <hi>Bloody Sacrifices</hi> for their <hi>Nourishment</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,</hi> and that inclin'd them to that Malignity of <hi>Nature,</hi> that made the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils;</hi> that ungovernable <hi>Pride,</hi> that <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy</hi> at the Prosperity of others, that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish of <hi>Cruelty,</hi> and doing ill Offices to their fellow Creatures, which are the Characteristicks of those <hi>wicked</hi> Beings. This being suppos'd, must make them uncapable of Acting the reasonable, but only the inferiour material, Faculties. Their Power therefore was conceiv'd to be only in the <hi>Imagination,</hi> and the <hi>material</hi> Faculties depending on it. These being suited to their <hi>degenerated</hi> Nature, they can therefore Act upon them as far as the Rules of <hi>Providence</hi> shall give them leave, for the tryal of <hi>free Agents,</hi> in order to <hi>Rewards</hi> or <hi>Punishments.</hi>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:49804:66"/>
Their way of <hi>Tempting</hi> therefore, is to <hi>awaken</hi> those <hi>Ideas</hi> which lie <hi>Dormant</hi> in the <hi>Imagination</hi> and <hi>sensitive Memory,</hi> as the effects of <hi>vicious Inclinations,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd by frequently repeated <hi>vicious Acts.</hi> I mean, to awaken them at the <hi>Presence</hi> of <hi>vicious Objects,</hi> and suitable <hi>Opportunities.</hi> This may be allow'd them, if they be permitted to Act up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Brain,</hi> the Seat of the <hi>Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and the other <hi>material</hi> Faculties and <hi>Ideas</hi> which raise the <hi>Passions,</hi> and make them <hi>Head-strong,</hi> and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affect the whole <hi>Body,</hi> in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbances following upon them. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly <hi>Madnesses,</hi> which arise from Disorders of the <hi>Brain,</hi> were usually as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crib'd to <hi>Devils</hi> in those Times. The Excellent Mr. <hi>Mead,</hi> has long since made this Observation on those Words of the Evangelist: <hi>He hath a Devil, and is Mad; why hear ye him?</hi> Joh. x. 20. So having a <hi>Devil,</hi> is the same with being <hi>Mad,</hi> in the Language of that Age. <hi>Thou hast a Devil: Who go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth about to kill thee?</hi> Joh. vii. 20. And when the <hi>Jews</hi> charge our Saviour with <hi>Inconsistency</hi> in his Discourse, they tell him that he had a <hi>Devil,</hi> Joh. viii. 48. but more plainly <hi>v. 52. Now we know that thou hast a Devil; Abraham is dead,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49804:67"/>
and the Prophets, and thou sayest, If a Man keep my saying, he shall never taste of Death.</hi> So St. <hi>John</hi> x. 21. <hi>These are not the Words of one that hath a Devil.</hi> From the <hi>Coherence</hi> of our Saviour's Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, they infer that he had no <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</hi> The same Opinion is represented by St. <hi>Justin Martyr,</hi> as the Sense of the Christians of his Age, that <hi>Mad</hi> Persons <note place="margin">Apology.</note> were believed to be <hi>Daemoniacks.</hi> As therefore King <hi>Saul</hi> was Punished by having an evil <hi>Spirit</hi> sent him from the Lord; so also, frequently in the <hi>Poets,</hi> the ancientest Writers of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and the <hi>Personators</hi> of the <hi>eldest Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> they knew of, it is mentioned as the Punishment of <hi>piacular</hi> Persons; that they were delivered over to <hi>Furies,</hi> and by them <hi>alienated</hi> from their <hi>Senses,</hi> and driven into <hi>Madness.</hi> So in the Case of <hi>Athamas,</hi> of <hi>Hercules,</hi> of <hi>Alc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maeon,</hi> of <hi>Orestes,</hi> &amp;c. And their Cure was usually by <hi>Expiations</hi> and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of <hi>Religion,</hi> rather than <hi>Physick,</hi> which proved the Aylings to be caus'd immediately by <hi>Spirits.</hi> Yet sometimes also by <hi>Physick,</hi> which proved withal, that the <hi>Disposition</hi> of the <hi>matter</hi> was removeable by <hi>Natural</hi> Expedients, and that when it was so, the <hi>Evil Spirits</hi> had no longer Power to molest those
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:49804:67"/>
who were so Cur'd, by the Rules pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd to them by Providence. This <hi>Hippocrates</hi> proves particularly in the Case of the <hi>Morbus Sacer.</hi> Besides these <note place="margin">de Morb. Sac.</note> 
               <hi>Distractions</hi> of <hi>Mind,</hi> there were also other <hi>Aylings</hi> and <hi>Diseases</hi> inflicted by way of <hi>Punishment</hi> on Criminals by the Sentence of God, and the Intervention of <hi>Evil Spirits.</hi> Such were the <hi>Falling-Sickness,</hi> such were <hi>Aylings</hi> returning with the Changes of the Moon, such were <hi>Leprosies,</hi> such several sorts of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> and <hi>Agues,</hi> such all those Molesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which were removable by <hi>Charms,</hi> and the like suspected means of <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants</hi> and <hi>Intercourse</hi> with <hi>Evil Spirits.</hi> For it was the receiv'd Opinion, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> shews, that the <hi>Devils</hi> could Cure no Maladies but such as had been caus'd by them, by ceasing to use the <hi>Means</hi> that had caus'd them, when they were adress'd to in the ways appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by themselves, and permitted by Providence for the <hi>Punishment</hi> of those who rely'd on them, and maintained such unlawful <hi>Intercourse</hi> with the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> that had appointed them. They did not so much as pretend to Cure all sorts of <hi>Diseases</hi> by <hi>Charms</hi> and <hi>Expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations.</hi> I believe all those Diseases which were so Cured, may be reduc'd to the

               </gap>, the rather apposite to this purpose, because they, as well as our <hi>Sacred</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>design'd mystical Senses,</hi> especially in their <hi>Symbols.</hi> But I cannot allow my self at present, to follow this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as far as it would lead me. It suffices now, to observe that this <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis</hi> seems generally alluded to in the Sacred Writers, especially of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> and therefore cannot indeed be thought so <hi>precarious</hi> as our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries might otherwise conceive, if they will suffer themselves to be led away with <hi>popular Prejudices,</hi> without <hi>examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> it. The <hi>New Testament</hi> plainly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough distinguishes the Gift of <hi>Healing,</hi> which Cured <hi>Diseases</hi> not caus'd by <hi>Devils,</hi> directly from the Curing <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities</hi> caus'd by <hi>Devils,</hi> which were sufficiently Cured by casting out the <hi>Devils</hi> that caus'd them. And I think also, that they mention no Aylings of the latter sort, which may not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for by their Power allow'd them by God on the Parts now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd. However, this <hi>Difference</hi> between <hi>Divine Prophecy</hi> and <hi>Diabolical Enthusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asm,</hi> seems to have been generally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed on, that <hi>Prophecy</hi> requir'd <hi>Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> but perfected and duly <hi>subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated</hi> to the Nobler Faculties; but <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasm</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:49804:69"/>
went no farther than the <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination;</hi> and therefore disorder'd and hindred the <hi>Understanding,</hi> and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material Faculties depending on it. And our Adversaries must be very difficult indeed in their Concessions, if they can doubt whether <hi>Instrumental Musick</hi> can affect the <hi>Imagination,</hi> so as to Compose or Disorder it. Yet this alone is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for disabling <hi>Devils</hi> to Influence it, if their Power be confined by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to disposed Matter, and <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick</hi> may indispose the <hi>Imagination</hi> for their Influences, and it be not withal, in their Power to make or hinder Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions.</p>
            <p>BUT our Adversaries have a strange <note place="margin">XIII. Such a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of our Religion as makes <hi>unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable</hi> of <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible</hi> Assistan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentally <hi>inconsistent</hi> with the Doctrine of the <hi>Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Age.</note> Notion of the <hi>Spiritualness</hi> of our <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> Religion, as if all <hi>Bodily</hi> and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal</hi> Assistances were now perfectly <hi>useless</hi> and <hi>inconsistent</hi> with the Nature of our present Dispensation. On this account, they are averse to all Assistan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of our <hi>Senses,</hi> as well as this of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental Musick.</hi> But why should God have Instituted <hi>Sacraments</hi> for Assisting our <hi>Senses,</hi> if the whole kind of such Assistances had been so derogatory to the Nature of his new Establishment? Why should he have allow'd even <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:49804:70"/>
Musick,</hi> if even our <hi>Senses</hi> could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute nothing to the raising of the Devotion of our <hi>Spirits?</hi> I know our Adversaries are more willing to impute this <hi>Usefulness</hi> of <hi>Instrumental Musick,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the extraordinary Interposition of God, seconding his own Institution. But why should they think it deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to the Providence of God, that he should make use of the Power, himself has given to the Natures of Things? Or why should they deny the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of so many <hi>Heathens,</hi> who, tho' they regarded not the Institutions of the God of the <hi>Jews,</hi> yet receiv'd the same Practice of <hi>Instrumental Musick,</hi> on account of the Devotion they pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to feel rais'd in themselves by it, in their several false Religions. This could be imputable to nothing but the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the things themselves. But where have they learned such a Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Spiritualness</hi> of the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion, that should exclude the <hi>Use,</hi> or even the <hi>Necessity,</hi> of <hi>Corporeal</hi> Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances. The Scripture is not more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press in requiring a <hi>Spiritual</hi> Worship, than it is in requiring that also of the <hi>Body.</hi> Our <hi>Bodies</hi> are <hi>Temples of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost,</hi> and we are accordingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd <hi>to Glorifie God in our Bodies,</hi> as
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49804:70"/>
well as our <hi>Spirits which are his,</hi> 1 Cor. vi. 19, 20. <hi>The unmarried Woman,</hi> is so to care <hi>for the things of the Lord, that she may be Holy both in Body and in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> vii. 34. We are to <hi>present our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies a living Sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is our reasonable Service,</hi> Rom. xii. 1. And our <hi>whole Spirit, and Soul, and Body, are to be preserved Blameless un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Coming of our Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> 1 Thes. v. 23. If Service be expected from the <hi>Body</hi> as well as the <hi>Spirit,</hi> How can it be disagreeable to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of our <hi>Spiritual</hi> Religion, that such Parts of <hi>Bodily</hi> Worship may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd or introduc'd as may in their own Nature contribute to the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of the <hi>Spirit?</hi> There was indeed near the <hi>Apostles</hi> times, an <hi>Opinion</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd among the <hi>Philosophers, Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menius</hi> perhaps may be the first that brought it in, from whom <hi>Porphyry</hi> owns <hi>Plotinus</hi> to have borrowed what he has to this purpose, That the <hi>Soul</hi> alone was the <hi>Man,</hi> and that the <hi>Body</hi> was no part of the <hi>Man,</hi> but a Prison to the <hi>Soul,</hi> and therefore preternatur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to it, and to be avoided by it, that it might be qualified for a perfect State. And these did indeed so insist on the Spiritual Nature of Religion, as to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49804:71"/>
the <hi>Body</hi> from any share in it. The <hi>Good Man</hi> with them was the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Priest, the <hi>Soul</hi> it self the only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable Temple, the Devotion of the Mind the pleasing Sacrifice. And the the way to union with God, was to alienate themselves as much as was possible from the <hi>Body,</hi> and from the <hi>external Societies</hi> of Men, and to enure themselves to abstracted Operations of the Mind, in order to the Cultivating of the Spirit, which was the only Power that they thought capable of an Union with the Supreme Being. This is that <hi>Philosophical Religion</hi> so much Celebrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Plotinus, Porphyry</hi> himself, and <hi>Hierocles,</hi> and several other of the later Philosophers. <hi>Porphyry</hi> particularly was very much pleas'd with it, as appears from his Sentences, and his Books <hi>de Abstinentiâ,</hi> but especially from his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle to <hi>Anebo,</hi> where he does by these Principles undermine all Obligation to the <hi>Externals</hi> of the <hi>Heathen,</hi> as well <note place="margin">Ap. <hi>Jambli.</hi> de myst <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.

               </note> as the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion. This put him on Starving himself in his <hi>Lilybaean</hi> Retirement, if his Master <hi>Plotinus</hi> (whom he follow'd in these Opinions) had not reclaim'd him. This seems to be the Original of all that <hi>Enthusiasm</hi> that has decry'd the external Ordinances and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49804:71"/>
even of <hi>Christ</hi> himself, upon Pretences to greater Perfection, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Fancies of the old <hi>Monks</hi> relating this way in <hi>Anastasius Sinaita;</hi> of the Popish <hi>Mystical Divinity</hi> and <hi>Quietism,</hi> of the <hi>Familists</hi> and <hi>Quakers,</hi> of the <hi>Bourignonists</hi> and <hi>Philadelphians,</hi> &amp;c. It is strange, our <hi>Presóyterian</hi> Adversaries who dislike these <hi>Consequences</hi> in others, so destructive of their own Discipline, are notwithstanding insensible of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage they have given to others, of justifying <hi>Separation</hi> from <hi>themselves,</hi> by these Pretences of the <hi>Spiritual</hi> Nature of the <hi>Evangelical</hi> Worship, by which themselves defended their own Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from their own Superiours. This might at least have warned them to a more accurate Examination of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, when they found they could not justifie the Consequences which followed from it. For us it is abundantly suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient that this Doctrine, tho' taught by the Adversaries of the Apostles Age, was not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding perfectly different from the Sense of the <hi>Apostolical Church</hi> it self. The <hi>Hereticks</hi> by this means evaded the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection</hi> of the <hi>Body,</hi> pretending the <hi>Resurrection</hi> promis'd was already past, in their <hi>mystical Resurrection</hi> from Sin. For the rising of the <hi>Body</hi> could not be
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:49804:72"/>
thought a Reward, if the being in the <hi>Body</hi> was preternatural, and a State of Punishment. Thence also it proceeded, that so many of those first <hi>Hereticks</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed the Flesh, as not belonging to them, and condemn'd <hi>Marriage,</hi> as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing to confine Souls to Bodies, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this very Pretence of being them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Spiritual, and being therefore for a more <hi>Spiritual</hi> way of Worship. But it is as certain, that this Doctrine was different from the Doctrine of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,</hi> as it is certain the <hi>Apostles</hi> were for the Holy Treatment and Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the <hi>Body,</hi> and that they Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd those for <hi>Hereticks,</hi> who Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son'd from this Principle insisted on by our Adversaries, of which they had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise no better means of Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. How therefore can our Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries Reason loosly for the <hi>Reformation</hi> of Christianity from that same Principle which we see was contrary to the very Foundations of truly <hi>Primitive Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Christianity?</hi> Which was the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of most of those <hi>Heresies</hi> which were then Condemn'd by that Unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable Authority.</p>
            <p>FOR my part, I can see no <hi>Difference,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">XIV. The same <hi>Reasons</hi> that prov'd <hi>Bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> worship useful in the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, prove it so still.</note> in this particular, between the <hi>Old</hi> and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:49804:72"/>
the <hi>New Peculium.</hi> We have <hi>Bodies</hi> as well as they, and of the same frail Make and Constitution as theirs were. Our Souls are also of the same Kind, as dependent on our Bodies as theirs, and as apt to be Influenc'd by them. <hi>Providence</hi> has impos'd no new Rules, that we know of, for the Influences of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil Spirits,</hi> from what were impos'd then. What then should hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but that still our Minds should be Influenc'd by the <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions of our <hi>Bodies</hi> as much as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly? And that in order to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Influences of both sorts of <hi>Spirits.</hi> And certainly they cannot think that <hi>Musick</hi> has lost any of that Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on our <hi>Bodies</hi> that it had formerly. How can they therefore doubt, but that it might still have the same effect on the like <hi>Bodies,</hi> alike Influencing the same kind of <hi>Souls?</hi> The Church is still as much a Body as it was then, and as much oblig'd to Worship God in Assemblies, tho' not confin'd to one particular Nation, as it was then. And the Apostle requires that all Acts of the Worship in Assemblies, were to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd with a design of Edifying the whole Assemblies. He permits no Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of Gifts, even of the Divine Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:49804:73"/>
there, but such as were for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Edification. But the Edification of Assemblies is not otherwise perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able than by Sensible and Corporeal Significations. These are the only means by which the whole Body can Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate in the Devotion of every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, by which they can mutually give and receive Edification. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore still as impossible to signifie a great Honour for the <hi>Deity</hi> Ador'd in such Assemblies but by Signs greatly affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the very Senses. And what is done in the Name of the whole Body, ought to be suited to the Dignity of the Body represented. That must be by Signs by which Bodies usually signifie their great Respect by the Customs of such <hi>Bodies.</hi> But <hi>Bodies</hi> do not usually sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie their great Respect in their World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intercourse otherwise than by <hi>Pomp</hi> and <hi>Magnificence.</hi> They cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore signifie it in Affairs of <hi>Religion</hi> by Signs, mean and ordinary. Especially if their Design be to signifie it to the Senses, and for the Edification of others. For certainly Signs which signifie a mean or no Respect on other occasions, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be thought to signifie a great one in the Affairs of <hi>Religion.</hi> It is on the contrary taken as an Affront to <hi>Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:49804:73"/>
excellent Persons in a way unsuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their <hi>Character,</hi> tho' the same Significations might justly be reputed <hi>Honourable,</hi> if perform'd to an inferiour Person to whom they had been propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable. This Consideration must make all Significations short of the utmost that can be done dishonourable when paid to an Infinitely Perfect Being. The <hi>Magnificence</hi> therefore of the Worship of God, ought to be such as it us'd to signifie the greatest Respect to the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the <hi>Spectators,</hi> if the Respect be to be signified Sensibly. I know not how our Adversaries can deny any part of this Reasoning on the Principles now mentioned.</p>
            <p>BUT I know they do pretend Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority <note place="margin">XV. The VVor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God in Spirit, not oppos'd to that which is <hi>Sensible</hi> &amp; <hi>Corporeal,</hi> but to the <hi>Literal</hi> Sense of the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</hi>
               </note> for this way of Arguing, <hi>God is a Spirit,</hi> says our Saviour, <hi>and they that Worship him, must Worship him in Spirit and in Truth,</hi> St. Joh. iv. 24. This is spoken with relation to the Worship of the <hi>Jews</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans</hi> on Mount <hi>Gerizim;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must signifie something Spiritual in the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion, which was not so in the Worship of the <hi>Jews</hi> and the <hi>Samaritans.</hi> But this might very well be true without making <hi>external</hi> Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49804:74"/>
inconsistent with the <hi>spiritual</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion. The true Account of this Matter, I take to be this: That in what was common to the <hi>Jews</hi> and the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> there were two Parts, the <hi>Sensible</hi> and the <hi>External</hi> Part, which was proper to themselves, and which the <hi>Christians</hi> were not concern'd in; and the <hi>Mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> and <hi>Spiritual,</hi> which was principally design'd by God, which was thencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to obtain as the peculiar Glory of the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion. So the <hi>New Testament</hi> is oppos'd to the <hi>Old,</hi> that it is not of the <hi>Letter</hi> as the <hi>Old</hi> was, but of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> 2 Cor. iii. 6. that is, that the <hi>New Testament</hi> is really the same with the <hi>Old,</hi> the same thing in the <hi>Spiritual</hi> Sense, which was prefigur'd by the <hi>Literal</hi> Sense, of what was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd on the <hi>Jews</hi> then. Thus the <hi>Letter</hi> and <hi>Circumcision</hi> are taken for <hi>Circumcision</hi> in the <hi>Literal</hi> Sense, <hi>Rom.</hi> ii. 27. by a known <hi>Hendiadis,</hi> and <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision</hi> of the <hi>Heart,</hi> is said to be in <hi>the Spirit, not in the Letter,</hi> v. 29. So the <hi>Service in newness of the Spirit,</hi> is oppos'd to that which had been <hi>in the oldness of the Letter,</hi> Rom. vii. 6. And when the <hi>Jews</hi> understood our Saviour's Discourse concerning <hi>Eating his Flesh,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:49804:74"/>
and Drinking his Blood</hi> in a <hi>Carnal</hi> Sense, he Corrects their Mistake, by telling them, <hi>That the Words he had spoken to them were Spirit and Life,</hi> St. Joh. vi. 63. that is, by warning them, that his Words were to be understood not <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally</hi> but <hi>Mystically. Life</hi> is join'd with <hi>Spirit</hi> in our Saviour's Words, exactly as it is by the Apostle, when he also tells us, that the <hi>Letter killeth,</hi> but the <hi>Spirit giveth Life,</hi> 2 Cor. iii. 6. intimating, that the <hi>Life</hi> promis'd by <hi>Moses,</hi> when he set <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Israelites,</hi> was not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from the Observation of the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral</hi> Sense of the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Law, but the <hi>Mystical,</hi> which was a strong Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to the <hi>New Peculium.</hi> Because the <hi>Mystical</hi> Sense even of the <hi>old Law,</hi> which was the principal Sense design'd by God, was suppos'd to be the same with the Gospel. So <hi>Spirit and Truth</hi> are also fitly join'd together in the Discourse of our Saviour with the Woman of <hi>Samaria.</hi> For the <hi>Mystical</hi> Sense, was the Sense truly intended by God, and the <hi>Literal</hi> no otherwise then as conveying the <hi>Mystical.</hi> The <hi>Truth</hi> here is also opposed to the <hi>Shadow.</hi> So the Apostle tells us, that the <hi>Law was a</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Heb. viii. 5. x. 1. Col. ii. 17.</note> 
               <hi>Shadow of things to come,</hi> that is, of

those which were to be fulfilled under the Gospel. The <hi>Shadow</hi> is oppos'd to the <hi>Body</hi> that causes it, therefore the Word <hi>Body</hi> as signifying <hi>Truth</hi> in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to the <hi>Shadow</hi> of the <hi>Body,</hi> is apply'd to the <hi>Realities</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> even in things not properly <hi>Corporeal.</hi> So <hi>the fullness of the Godhead</hi> was said to <hi>dwell</hi> in our blessed Saviour <hi>Bodily.</hi>

This is so notorious, that not having leisure for it, I cannot think it necessary to heap Examples. Our Saviour's Design
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:49804:75"/>
therefore in this Discourse with the <hi>Woman</hi> of <hi>Samaria,</hi> is to shew that the confinement of the solemn Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God to one Place, either <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi> or <hi>Mount Gerizim,</hi> was disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the <hi>Nature</hi> of the Worship of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and therefore to be <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brogated</hi> by it. And as to that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Design, I take our blessed Lords Reasoning to be this. The original <hi>Consecration</hi> both of the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> and the <hi>Temple,</hi> was by the Descent of a Luminous Body on them, as a <hi>Symbol</hi> of the Majestatick Presence of God, which the <hi>Rabbins</hi> call a <hi>Schechinah.</hi> This visible Appearance at first, was suppos'd to be the cause of the <hi>Consecration,</hi> which lasted afterwards, long after the visible Appearance it self had disappear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as the <hi>Jews</hi> say it did under the second <hi>Temple.</hi> This way of <hi>Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> confin'd <hi>Consecration</hi> to Places. The <hi>Schechinah</hi> it self, as a Body, could not be otherwise than confin'd. And whilst God was pleas'd to reserve this Power to himself, that besides the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration</hi> of Men, which was requisite to separate the Place <hi>Consecrated</hi> from common uses, no Place however should be counted Holy, till God himself had signified his own Acceptance of it, by
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:49804:76"/>
such a visible <hi>Symbol</hi> of his own Presence; it followed necessarily, that if God shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this <hi>Symbol</hi> only in one Place, no other Place besides that one could be counted Holy as accepted by him. But the true Presence of God signified by that <hi>Symbol,</hi> our Saviour observes, and that by the <hi>mystical</hi> way of <hi>Reasoning</hi> then receiv'd, to have been suitable to the Nature of God himself, who was a Spirit, and therefore Spiritual, and might as well be (if God pleas'd) in Places where no such Appearance was to the Senses, as where it was. Withal, that these invisible <hi>Archetypes</hi> were the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal things that were to hold when the visible <hi>Ectypes</hi> were abolished; this was also granted him in the <hi>Platonick</hi> Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of that Age. When therefore the Gospel was to take place, which was a State of those very <hi>Archetypes</hi> which were Prefigur'd in the Law, from that time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God was not to insist on that way of Consecration, by visible <hi>Schechinahs</hi> which had been required before. But as the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of a Place from common use, was sufficient on Man's part to Consecrate it, if God should be pleas'd to accept it; so when this way of signifying the Divine ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance immediately by a <hi>Schechinah</hi> was laid aside, the Divine acceptance
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:49804:76"/>
would be sufficiently signified by the acceptance of the Priest whom God had Invested with an indefinite Authority, of not only representing, but obliging, him to ratifie what he was to do in his Name, in things wherein God had not particularly oblig'd him to expect a more particular Signification of his Pleasure. When therefore this mystical Dispensation was to take place, then as every City was to be equal with Mount <hi>Gerizim,</hi> or even <hi>Jerusalem</hi> it self, then the Bishops of particular Cities, were to be equal with the High-Priest of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> and might as freely Consecrate as he, and exercise the supreme Power of the Evangelical Mystical Sacrifice within his own Jurisdiction. This I take to be the true Design of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours Discourse in that Place, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Samaritans,</hi> not to be surpriz'd at this Change, which was punctually fulfill'd in the Event, how contrary soever it seem'd to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent receiv'd Opinions and Expectations.</p>
            <p>AND what is there in all this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning, <note place="margin">XVI. Nothing therefore can be Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental Music</hi> that is inconsistent with the <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the <hi>Worship</hi> of the <hi>Gospel.</hi>
               </note> wherein our Adversaries can think our present Cause concern'd? Spiritual we see here, is not oppos'd to Bodily, but Literal, that is Literal of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49804:77"/>
the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> where it was to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfere with the Mystical Sense, which was principally intended by the <hi>Legislator.</hi> Do we revive the Literal Sense as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd the particular Nation of the <hi>Jews?</hi> Or do we extend the Obligation of it far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therso as to oblige other Nations, on whom it was not impos'd then, and for whom it was never intended, under the Spiritual Dispensation of the Gospel? Do we so urge the Literal Sense as to exclude the Mystical, so as to exclude <hi>Gentiles</hi> from the Benefits of the <hi>Law,</hi> whilst they do indeed more comply with the true De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of the <hi>Legislator,</hi> than if they had observed the Literal Sense? Do we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude any from the new <hi>Peculium,</hi> who have the Circumcision of the Spirit, for no other Reason, but because they want the Circumcision of the Letter? This had indeed been repugnant to the Design of the Gospel, which was to convince us, that, in all things incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent, the Observation of the Mystical Sense was to take place of the Literal, and thenceforwards to take away its Obligation. And do we say otherwise? Or do we say, that <hi>Schechinahs</hi> are to be expected for Consecrations now, or any other Significations of the Divine Acceptance of what is separated for his
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:49804:77"/>
use by Men, besides the acceptance of them, who are Authoriz'd in general to represent and oblige him in things whereof he has made no particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception? Can they pretend, that our present Dispute has any Relation to those which devided the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Christians</hi> in the Apostolical Age? They very well know, that our present Dispute is wholly between <hi>Christians,</hi> and has no relation to the Obligation of the <hi>Mosa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick</hi> Law in any Sense. It is very true, that the Literal Sense of the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Law usually related to External Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Things, and the Mystical to Things Insensible and Spiritual. And the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Sense being the Spiritual, may give the occasion why our Adversaries fancy that the Mystical Sense should always relate to Spiritual Things. But it is not being oppos'd to Sensible or Bodily, but Literal, shews plainly that the things concern'd in the Literal Sense, are not consider'd in this Reasoning, as Sensible and Corporeal, And on the other side, in the Reasonings of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> the <hi>Evangelical</hi> Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions even in this World, are all sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to belong to the Spiritual Sense of the old Law. And for that very Reason it is inferr'd, that they were
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49804:78"/>
principally regarded by God, because the mystical Sense of the Law was more principally intended by him than the Literal. The whole Evangelical Institution, is, in the same <hi>Reasoning,</hi> suppos'd to be the Pattern shewed to <hi>Moses</hi> in the <hi>Mount,</hi> in Imitation of which, the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> was to be made. And this in order to the proving, that the Evangelical Institutions were to be Eternal, because the <hi>Ideal</hi> Patterns of things were in the <hi>Platonick</hi> way of <hi>Reasoning</hi> suppos'd to be so. This Eternity concern'd in this Dispute, can only be meant of that which was to last as long as this World; so <hi>the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Hills,</hi> Gen. xlix. 26. And <hi>the everlasting Mountains,</hi> Hab. iii. 6. And the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> is said to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for an <hi>everlasting Possession,</hi> Gen. xvii. 8. xlviii. 4. For in this Sense, the <hi>Everlastingness</hi> of the Gospel, is oppos'd to the Duration of the Law, which was, even in this Life, to give way to a more lasting Establishment. But it is certain, that those very Institutions of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, which have succeeded the abrogat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Institutions of the Law, and which are therefore suppos'd to be Spiritual in this Sense, as Spiritual is oppos'd to the Literal Sense of the Law, are not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:49804:78"/>
themselves Sensible and Corporeal. So is Baptism, which has succeeded in the Place of the abrogat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Circumcision of the Letter. So also is our Eucharistical Sacrifice, which now answers the abrogated Bloody Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. These therefore must be suppos'd to be Spiritual in this Sense of the Word, notwithstanding their being Sensible and Corporeal. Our Adversaries therefore do certainly mistake the meaning of this Reasoning, when they hence ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that any Observations are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Spiritual Nature of the Gospel, on that account alone, because they are Sensible and Corporeal.</p>
            <p>BUT, tho' Sensible Assistances should <note place="margin">XVII. <hi>Pomp</hi> and <hi>Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence</hi> of the <hi>external</hi> Worship, is not inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent with the Design of the <hi>Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</hi>
               </note> not be inconsistent with the Nature of Evangelical Worship, yet our Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries think, at least, that Pomp and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence must needs be so. One would think, by the gradation, that their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments on this Head were more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and convictive, but it proves quite the contrary. Not one Text can they pretend against the Pomp and Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of the publick Worship of God. rather all the appearance of Scripture Reasonings is against them. The Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of the Old Testament was manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:49804:79"/>
very Magnificent; nor can our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries <hi>deny</hi> that it <hi>was</hi> so; what have they therefore to say, why it ought not to be so <hi>still?</hi> Can they shew any <hi>Text</hi> of the <hi>New Testament</hi> against it as a thing that was to <hi>cease</hi> and to be no <hi>more</hi> practis'd? I know of none they do pretend either in the <hi>same,</hi> or in <hi>equivalent</hi> Terms. Can they then pretend any thing <hi>inconsistent</hi> with it in the constitution of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> or of the <hi>new Peculium?</hi> These things I have shewn to be the true <hi>Originals</hi> of the <hi>abrogation</hi> of what was indeed <hi>abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated</hi> in the old <hi>Mosaick</hi> Law. The <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning</hi> of the <hi>Old Test;</hi> as well as the <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive</hi> Precepts of it, rather <hi>favour,</hi> than <hi>contradict,</hi> the <hi>Magnificence</hi> and <hi>Sumptuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of the <hi>publick</hi> Solemnities of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worship. <hi>David</hi> would not offer <hi>Burnt Offerings</hi> unto the Lord his God, of that which cost him nothing. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> xxiv. 24. and <hi>Malachy</hi> makes <hi>mean Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices</hi> to redound to the contempt of the <hi>Religion</hi> wherein they were used.

St. <hi>Luke</hi> xxi. 3. This plainly shews, That as God does graciously <hi>accept</hi> of <hi>mean</hi> things from those who are able to give no <hi>more,</hi> so he does not <hi>excuse</hi> them from <hi>Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence</hi>

whose <hi>Abilities</hi> may afford it. Our Saviour <hi>reasons</hi> the same way in the case of the Woman who <hi>anointed</hi> his <hi>Feet</hi> with the <hi>Alabaster</hi> Box of very <hi>precious Ointment.</hi> The same Objection was <note place="margin">S. Mat. xxvi. 7, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> S. Mark xiv. 3. S.

He allow'd a <hi>liberality</hi> in shewing their respect to the <hi>Temple</hi> of his Body, as a token of what he would also judge commendable if us'd to the <hi>material Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> that should <hi>afterwards</hi> be Consecrated to his Worship. And in giveing a <hi>prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> for <hi>teaching</hi> his <hi>Disciples</hi> what he would have <hi>them</hi> do <hi>afterwards,</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing</hi> it, he did not allow even the present <hi>Necessities</hi> of his <hi>Disciples</hi> to over-rule him. Thus, I am very apt to think, the <hi>generality</hi> of his <hi>Disciples</hi> were then <hi>inclinable</hi> to <hi>understand</hi> him. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:49804:80"/>
               <hi>thus,</hi> in all likelihood, he <hi>design'd</hi> they should understand him, when he gave them no <hi>warning</hi> of <hi>misunderstanding</hi> him in such a <hi>way</hi> of <hi>Interpreting</hi> his Mind as he <hi>foresaw</hi> them <hi>inclinable</hi> to follow by the way of <hi>reasoning</hi> of that Age. It was a receiv'd <hi>Principle,</hi> that our Saviours <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> as well as his <hi>Discourses,</hi> were <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical</hi> and <hi>Instructive.</hi> And that they <hi>signified</hi> many things which were not to be understood at <hi>present,</hi> but afterwards when they were <hi>fulfilled,</hi> and when Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence had fitted circumstances for <hi>practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi> them. Especially in things which were not <hi>practicable</hi> at <hi>present,</hi> as not fitted to their present <hi>Circumstances.</hi> This was plainly the Case then in relation to the Subject of our present Discourse. The Poverty of the Apostolical Christians, disabled them for all things Sumptuous and Magnificent. Nor was there then any Prospect of a Change for the better which might make it prudent to provide expresly for the Case. Withal our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <note place="margin">S. Joh. xiii. 7.</note> Saviour knew that his Sense would be gathered from his Actions. Himself had train'd up his Disciples to do so. And the <hi>Jews</hi> in their mystical Interpretations of the History of the Old Testament had, even in his time, taken up the Custom of gathering the Sense of God from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:49804:81"/>
Instincts and Actions of their own Patriarchs. The leaving them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to those Inferences, which he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw them inclinable to make from his Actions and Intimations was a very prudent, a very sufficient Provision for a Case which was to fall out at such a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance afterwards.</p>
            <p>THE only Reason this present Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry insists on for proving the Inconsistence <note place="margin">XVIII. <hi>Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence</hi> not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the <hi>Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city</hi> of the <hi>Gospel.</hi>
               </note> of Magnificence with the Nature of the Worship of the Gospel, is that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists</hi> are usually censur'd for their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess in this kind. This he only takes for granted, and draws Inferences from it; but never offers any Proof that it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed blameable. The same way he takes in his use of the other popular Prejudices now disprov'd but, methinks, it would have better become them who so usually appeal from humane Authorities to the Scriptures, (if they could find any) that even themselves could judge favourable to their Design, before they had ventured on drawing Inferences. That would have made their Dissent look more like a reverence to greater Authority, than Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentmentand an Aversation to their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries against whom they are concern'd in this whole Dispute. But I cannot, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, imagine what they can pretend
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:49804:81"/>
from the Scriptures against the Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of Gods Worship in those who are able to bear the Burthen of it. They may fancy, perhaps, that the Simplicity of the Gospel may be inconsistent with this Magnificence. But the Simplicity of the Gospel is never (that I know of) us'd concerning the <hi>Worship</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi> it self, but concerning the <hi>good meaning</hi> of the <hi>Persons</hi> who <hi>Preached</hi> the <hi>Gospel.</hi> It is plainly oppos'd to <gap reason="foreign">

from the restitution of <hi>Instrumental Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick.</hi> He conceives that by the like <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences</hi> we may restore <hi>Circumcision</hi> and <hi>bloody Sacrifices,</hi> and the old Custom of <hi>Dancing</hi> to the <hi>Instrumental Musick.</hi> And what if we should grant him his last Consequence concerning <hi>Dancing,</hi> so far at least, as to acknowledge that the <hi>Church</hi> might <hi>lawfully</hi> reduce it? I doubt he would be hard put to it to prove it <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful.</hi> It <hi>must</hi> be so, at least, if he would <hi>confine</hi> himself, as they pretend to do, to the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> He cannot sure think there is any Argument in the irreverent <hi>Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> he uses concerning it. It is no other than what <hi>Michol</hi> would, probably, have used if she had spoken <hi>English.</hi> But <hi>David</hi> was contented to bear the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of it, and to justify it against her. And I believe our Adversaries will not easily question but that we are safer in following the Sense of <hi>David</hi> than they are in following that of <hi>Michol.</hi> The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of the Objection in both Cases, both of our <hi>Adversaries</hi> and of <hi>Michol,</hi> is to Charge the Posture of <hi>Dancing</hi> with the Imputation of <hi>Levity.</hi> As if there could not be <hi>Grave</hi> and <hi>Decorous Dances</hi> as well as <hi>Grave</hi> and <hi>Decorous Tunes;</hi> and as if there could not be <hi>Grave</hi> and <hi>Decorous</hi> tunes on <hi>Instrumental,</hi> as well as on <hi>Vocal,</hi> Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick.
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:49804:82"/>
At present, it is sufficient for us now, that if their Objection had been <hi>true</hi> in <hi>general,</hi> God would neither have allow'd <hi>sacred. Dancing</hi> then, nor would <hi>David</hi> have avowedly defended it, nor would God have <hi>seconded</hi> him in doing so by inflicting a <hi>Punishment</hi> on <hi>Michol</hi> for her Prophane upbraiding her Prince and <hi>Husband</hi> with it, as if in Practising it he had done any thing beneath the <hi>Dignity</hi> of his Station. If they will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend <hi>David</hi> in it, they are as much o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blig'd, as <hi>we</hi> are, to own the weakness of this <hi>general</hi> Charge. I think therefore the Practice, if it had been again receiv'd, secure enough if they will be pleas'd to admit no Objections against it <hi>now</hi> that would have prov'd it unlawful <hi>then.</hi> For we have a greater Evidence, than any their Reasons can pretend to that it was not unlawful <hi>then.</hi> But supposing it <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> yet the Apostle himself will assure them that all things indeed <hi>lawful</hi> are not on that account alone to be therefore own'd as <hi>expedient.</hi> 1.

And therefore fit to receive a <hi>new Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> There will be no more Obligation to revive <hi>that</hi> ancient Custom <hi>now,</hi> than many others which were undoubtedly <hi>allowable</hi> and <hi>prudent</hi> in those <hi>times</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they were universally <hi>receiv'd;</hi> but

That is because <hi>Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Musick</hi> is no way repugnantto the Constitution of the <hi>new Peculium,</hi> which is not true of the <hi>Jewish Circumcision,</hi> nor the <hi>Jewish Sacrifices.</hi> For no uncircumcis'd Person could partake of the <hi>Jewish Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> and he that was <hi>Circumcised,</hi> was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>Incorporated</hi> into the <hi>Jewish Nation.</hi> Whilst these two things were insisted on it was impossible for a <hi>Gentile</hi> not <hi>Incorporat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> into the <hi>Jewish Nation</hi> to be admitted to the <hi>Benefits</hi> of the <hi>new Peculium,</hi> which was directly <hi>contrary</hi> to the <hi>new Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of the <hi>Gospel.</hi> But our Author urges the <hi>Circumcision</hi> of other Nations as if their Agreement in it would have gone as far to have recommended it for a Law of Nations as their Consent in <hi>Instrumental Musick.</hi> But he did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that no other Nation that used <hi>Circumcision</hi> did pretend to use it as the <hi>Jews,</hi> as a Ceremony of Admission into the <hi>peculiar People</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which is the only Consideration, that made it <hi>incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent</hi> with the Constitution of the <hi>Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</hi> Several of them seem'd to have us'd it, not as an <hi>Initiation</hi> to their <hi>Nation,</hi> but to their <hi>Sacerdotal</hi> Dignity, to quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie

Men for being admitted to the Secrets of their <hi>Religion.</hi> So it seems to have been in the Cases of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion,</hi> who were <hi>Circumcised</hi> among the <hi>AEgyptians.</hi> And therefore also among other Nations who deriv'd their Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision from the <hi>AEgyptians,</hi> as particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Colchians</hi> are said to have done by <hi>Scsostris.</hi> And perhaps this may be the Reason why the <hi>old Peculium</hi> is call'd a <hi>Royal Priesthood,</hi> as well as a <hi>Holy Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> because the right of <hi>Admitting</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that <hi>Nation</hi> was equal to that which among other <hi>Nations</hi> was thought suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to confer that <hi>higher</hi> Degree of <hi>Sanctity</hi> which all Nations ascrib'd to their <hi>Priests</hi> above the ordinary <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> thought requisite to partake of the <hi>National Sacrifices</hi> which were common to the whole Nation.

               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:49804:86"/>
had been as Innocent as that of the <hi>Jews</hi> was, when observ'd only by their own Nation, and not impos'd on others, as a Condition requisite to qualify them for the <hi>Spiritual</hi> Favours of the <hi>Peculium.</hi> Upon those terms the <hi>Jews</hi> themselves, were permitted the use of it whilst they <hi>Commnnicated</hi> with the <hi>Uncircumcis'd Gentiles,</hi> in the Offices of the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion. Much less could it be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in other Nations, who never im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd it farther than their own Nation. There was therefore neither parity of <hi>Reason,</hi> nor sufficient Consent of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to prove the <hi>Jewish Circumcision</hi> lawful now, tho' we should on, those Accounts, grant that <hi>Instrumental Musick</hi> were so.</p>
            <p>BUT <hi>Bloody Sacrifices,</hi> our Adversary <note place="margin">XII. No <hi>Bloody Sacrifices</hi> whatsoever were fit for the Design of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.</hi>

               <hi>Capital,</hi> if one of another Nation did but come into that part of their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, where the publick Sacrifices were Offered. So it appears that it was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the remissness of their Discipline a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove that of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that made them allow others that were not of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to partake of their publick Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices. <hi>Augustus</hi> when he was in <hi>Egypt,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Suet.

It is true the <hi>Jews</hi> allow'd publick Sacrifices for the <hi>Persian</hi> Kings and the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours. But not so, as to suffer any <hi>Heathens</hi> to partake in them. Yet even this was blamed by the strictest Pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to the Observation of the Law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, the <hi>Galileans</hi> and the <hi>Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots.</hi> Tho' otherwise if any other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion could admit others to their Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal

Sacrifices, the <hi>Jews</hi> had more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to do so. They by their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession Worshipped a God, to whom all other Nations ought Duty as well as themselves, which other Nations did not pretend concerning their own Deities. There was therefore no Sacrifice of this kind, that all Nations with their Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal distinctives could pretend an equal Right to. How could they therefore unite all Nations into one Body, as it was the Design of our Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to unite them? None of them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to a Right to be confirmed in Heaven, besides that of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which yet could not unite all Nations, whilst it was believed to be the Right of one only Nation. There were no Bloody Sacrifices in the World, which being received into one Place, gave a Right to all other Sacrifices in the World. I do not now insist on what <hi>Porphyry</hi> has <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Porphyry</hi> de Abst.</note> endeavour'd to prove at large, that the first Sacrifices received among the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, were not Bloody, but Innocent, and such as were perfectly agreeable with his <hi>Pythagorean</hi> Notions, which were for the <gap reason="foreign">

things for it, from the Histories of the <hi>Heathens.</hi> That is enough to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove that sort, at least of Sacrifices, from being a <hi>Tradition</hi> of the Law of Nations. And the Reputation of being <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, had then prevail'd not only in those Cities which had submitted to <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagorean Legislators,</hi> but also among the <hi>Romans themselves.</hi> I am apt to think this was the Reason, why so many of the good Emperours who affected <hi>Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia Tempora,</hi> affected also that their Reigns might be <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, free from the <hi>Piaculum</hi> of shedding Civil Blood, at least of the better Quality. But the <hi>Pythagorean</hi> Doctrines were parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly grateful to the <hi>Jewish Essenes,</hi> who were as I said, the best disposed to the Christian Religion, and who seem therefore to have been extirpated by an universal Conversion, upon the appearance of it. They were most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to the Mystical sense of the Law, which is the Foundation of most of the Reasonings of the New Testament. <hi>Numenius</hi> the <hi>Heathen,</hi> who first joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Mystical Interpretation of the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> with the <hi>Heathen</hi> Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy, was a <hi>Pythagorean,</hi> and so was <hi>Philo</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi> and the <hi>Essenes,</hi> as the same <hi>Philo</hi> teaches. This alone was
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:49804:88"/>
sufficient to dispose the <hi>Essenes</hi> to an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation to Bloody Sacrifices, and to have the better Opinion of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, when they understood, that by it they could satisfie the Design of the <hi>Legislator</hi> without them. If they could once free themselves thereby, from the Obligation of the Bloody Sacrifices, required by the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> there were no other in view, that were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be substituted instead of them, at least by them. But the Mystical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations of the Old Testament, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded an easier account of the Change which was to be made by the Gospel, and more grateful to the Relish of the <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagorean Essenes,</hi> and the <hi>Philosophical As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceticks.</hi> The everlasting Priesthood which was to answer'd by that of the Gospel, was suppos'd to be that of <hi>Melchize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deck.</hi> So 'tis expresly called by the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> as the Apostle has observed: No doubt as granted him by the Mystical Reasonings of those Times.

               </gap> is the Word us'd by <hi>Philo,</hi> concerning him, as well as by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> concerning our Saviour) was <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> exactly the same with that of the Gospel. The Notion of a Priest implies an Offering, by the Reasoning in the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:49804:88"/>
Heb. viii. 3. And no other thing but <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> is mentioned in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Melchizedeck,</hi> that can be called an Offering. Our <hi>Eucharist</hi> therefore, must, by this Reasoning, be the everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Offering or Sacrifice, relating to his everlasting Priest-hood. The rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is a <hi>Bread</hi> from Heaven, mentioned also in the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> a very fit original <hi>Archetype</hi> to answer our <hi>Evangelical Terestrial Sacrifice.</hi> That was the <hi>Manna</hi> which was called <hi>Bread</hi> by <hi>Moses,</hi> and was indeed <hi>Rained</hi> from <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> and is called the <hi>Food of Angels</hi> by the <hi>Psalmist.</hi> No doubt to shew its <hi>Heavenly Mystical</hi> Nature, far exceeding the Nature of our common <hi>Bread.</hi> It is called also a <hi>Body prepared,</hi> as the same Apostle Quotes the Words of the <hi>Old Testament.</hi> These are the very Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions us'd by our blessed <hi>Saviour,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his own <hi>Sacrament</hi> in St. Joh. vi. He also calls it <hi>Manna, Bread from Heaven,</hi> and his own <hi>Body,</hi> exactly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to these <hi>Mystical Reasonings</hi> from the <hi>Old Testament.</hi> We never find any mention of an <hi>Archetypal Heavenly Beast,</hi> answering those <hi>Bloody Sacrifices.</hi> Yet the whole Benefit of these Sacrifices de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on these <hi>Archetypal Patterns</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering them in <hi>Heaven.</hi> Thence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd

the Obligation of God, to ratify in <hi>Heaven</hi> what was performed by the Priest on <hi>Earth,</hi> in giving or denying the <hi>Mystical Benefits</hi> of the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> as the Priest shall think fit to give or deny the <hi>Sacramental Elements.</hi> Thence the Union between the <hi>Church Militant</hi> and the <hi>Church Triumphant,</hi> on account of the Union between the <hi>Caelestial Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chetype,</hi> and the <hi>Terrestrial Eucharistical Sacrifice.</hi> Thence the Union between the <hi>Patriarchal Church</hi> of the <hi>Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and the <hi>Apostolical</hi> of the <hi>New,</hi> because the whole efficacy of those old Sacrifices of <hi>Beasts,</hi> was derived from their representing and applying the Death of our blessed <hi>Saviour,</hi> as commemorat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and apply'd in our Christian Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristical Sacrifice. Thence the Union of all the visible Churches in the World with the <hi>Caelestial Church,</hi> and among themselves, and the Reason obliging all particular Churches in Earth, to ratify each others Censures, which was that which made their Admissions into Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and their Excommunications Catholick, tho' the Acts themselves, were only the Acts of single Churches. The Reason was, because every particular in admitting a Member, intitled the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber so admitted to the Heavenly Church,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:49804:89"/>
with which all the particularly Churches in the World were one, and therefore were obliged to own such a Member, for a Member of themselves. And e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very particular Church in Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating a Member, deprived the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated of his Right to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venl Church; which whosoever want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, could not be owned by any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church, which pretended to be one with that which was Heavenly; of so much consequence was this whole My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Reasoning, greater perhaps than our Adversary was aware of. However, this Reasoning gives a clear Account, that tho' <hi>Instrumental Musick</hi> were as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different as we conceive it to be, it would not therefore follow, that it would be Indifferent, or in the Power of any Church, to restore the Custom of <hi>Bloody Sacrifices.</hi>

            <p>I know not whether it be worth <note place="margin">XXII. No Reason for opposing the first Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions whilst Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, for fear of <hi>Rigours</hi> afterwards.</note> the while, to take notice of another Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, much insisted on by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; that is, the Danger of exceeding in Impositions, if the first Impositions be submitted to. But truly conscientious Reasoners, would first have prov'd the Hurtfulness of many lawful Impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, if submitted to by the Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:49804:90"/>
subject. The Government might indeed be blamed for it; but in the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, (for whom they are concern'd) tho' the Imposition were indeed hard, yet submission to it for Peace sake, would for that Reason be highly commendable, as an Act of the greater self-denyal and the greater Zeal for Pecae and Discipline, and the greater Abhorrence of needless Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whilst nothing Sinful were impos'd. Then they would have given some <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> concerning the due Number that might be impos'd, that might neither be too small nor too numerous. This they would have done, if they had desir'd to have purged themselves to God, and their own Consciences, that they had not oppos'd subjection to those who were <hi>over them in the Lord,</hi> but <hi>Rigours</hi> of those who had abus'd the just Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity committed to them. But to stop at the first Impositions, before they can pretend them <hi>Rigorous,</hi> looks as if Flesh and Blood, as if Stomach and Resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as if an aversation to subjection it self, had been the original of their Quarrel. It runs into the opposite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme, as indeed their Defences of their Schism generally do, as if the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity it self, not any Tyrannical use of it, were the thing regretted by them.
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:49804:90"/>
The Topick it self they cannot defend, nor justifie the Consequences of it, who are notwithstanding so forward to warn others of Consequences. There is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any thing necessary in Humane Life, but what excess may make pernicious. Eating is so. Yet how great a part do Surfeits make in our Bills of Mortality? Will they therefore think it reasonable for avoiding Surfeits, to disswade from Eating? If they had no design of running into an extreme of opposing all Imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in things indifferent; our Churches Impositions, (whatever the Out-cry has been against them) have been so few, that I cannot tell how, even our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries themselves, could charge our Churches Impositions with being exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive, if they had allowed of any Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions at all: If they allow of none, they would do well to own that their Disputes are not against Abuses only of Authority, but against Authority it self. Their doing so, would let the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourers of Comprehension see, that our Disputes are not indeed of so trivial an Importance, as they are commonly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd to be. That they are indeed, whether we shall have any Authority which our Adversaries shall think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves oblig'd in Conscience to own,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:49804:91"/>
and to be concluded by, when nothing but Conscience can oblige them to it, in a State of Persecution. That is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed whether we our selves shall have any Body Politick, when they are once receiv'd into it. For we cannot any long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er have such a Body than we have the Authority essential to the Constitution of such a Body. Then it would become the Favourers of Comprehension to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider whether any Grants of our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries can make amends for so great a Concession on our Parts, as the Disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of our selves? Or whether any other independent Body in the World, would think fit to admit Enemies to their Constitution, into their Body to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with their hostile Opinions; or whether they could think any Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, how fair soever they might seem otherwise, to be sufficient to compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sate a Reconciliation of so fatal Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. The rather so, because it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly discharges Persons reconcil'd on such Terms from all Obligations to perform, what should afterwards be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd as a Condition of the Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation on their Parts. For it is only their Difference to our common Authority, that can make them really one with us, when they are admitted into our As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:49804:91"/>
The giving this up to them as a Condition of their coming in to us, is like opening a Gap which may seem to let them in whilst themselves please, but lets them out again as soon as their old Animosities shall put them on lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hold of new Pretences, or retriev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the old ones. But a regular Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of them, should be by the Gate. And the same Power of the Keys, which opens the Gate to them at their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, should lock them in after they are once admitted. I know no possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility they have of avoiding these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences, unless they can shew, either that a Body Politick can subsist with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Government, or, that Government can subsist without a right of imposing in things indifferent, either of which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed would be a great Performance. If therefore (to avoid the odium of so hard Terms imposed on us, of an Admissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which when it is made, shall give us no longer security of their Union with us, than themselves please) they will pretend a Defference to our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Ecclesiastical Authority that may keep them ours by Principles afterwards. I could then wish, that they would be pleas'd to consider farther, that when a true Authority is once admitted, That
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:49804:92"/>
must be allowed to judge concerning the Exigences of the Society to which it is related, and therefore to judge concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the true mean between both extremes, of what is deficient and what is super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous. I mean so as to conclude the subject in Affairs of that Nature. This Consideration will shew, that were there indeed any excess, yet the Authority would be responsible for it, but not to the Subject to whom it owes no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, but to God, from whom the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is indeed received. This will shew that the subject cannot be respon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for the Sin of the Imposition, so long as there can be prov'd no Sin in submitting to the Imposition, because the Imposition is a right to which the Subject cannot pretend. Where therefore the Sin of Imposition is separable from the Sin of Submission, there certainly the Duty of Submission still holds. The Reason is manifest, because the Subject cannot deny its Duty for a Cause that does not concern it to enquire into, and for which it is not responsible unto God, whatever may be amiss in it. And this will always be the Case, whilst the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions are only in matters of their own Nature indifferent.</p>

BUT our Author pleases himself par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly <note place="margin">XXIII. The ceasing of <hi>Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,</hi> Rev. 18. 22. describes a great Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity, but does not prove its un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulness.</note> with a Passage in the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations,</hi> where it is foretold concerning <hi>Babylon; That the Voice of Harpers and Musicians, and of Pipers and Trumpeters should be heard no more in her,</hi> Rev. xviii. 22. He urges it modestly, and it became him to do so, having before decried all Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing from that same Book, because of its Obscurity. The Reason holds in refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Facts to come. These are the things wherein the Prophetical Style is profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly obscure, even to those who were then living; not so in Facts, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or past. These, there is no Reason to believe that God intended to conceal from the meanest Capacities, because they were not likely to hinder the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wills which were to contribute their Parts in fulfilling the Prophesies here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered. And of this kind are the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusions, for which we are at present con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, to the then present Customs of the Church of <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> But to urge the Authority of this Book, as our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary does, with relation to the State of Antichrist, is to urge it in a Sense where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God usually design'd that his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies should not be understood till they were fulfilled, that they might not give warning to those who were to fulfill
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:49804:93"/>
them, as they must certainly do, if they could certainly be understood before. Till therefore this Prophesie (if it relate to Antichrist) be fulfilled, it is not to be expected that it should be understood so certainly as to be Argumentative. But, to give him the utmost that he can, with any Reason desire, all that he can make of it, is only to have it understood as a Prophesie, not as a Law; as a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the event, not as a Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of what was lawful or unlawful. It is very common in the Prophetick Scriptures, to foretel Judgments by the deprivation of what was delightful on any account, Good or Evil, even on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Religion as well as Luxury. So <hi>Hosea</hi> Prophesies that the Children of <hi>Israel should abide many Days without a King, and without a Prince; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Sacrifice, and without an Ephod.</hi> Hos. iii. 4. Can our Adversary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore gather, that <hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> and <hi>Ephods,</hi> were Sins then? No, but it is denounced as the most afflictive thing to them, who in the midst of their Impieties, were full of their Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of Zeal for God and for his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Jer.</hi> vii. 4. The like Predictions against the Temple, as a Punishment of the unworthy Worshipers in it, are
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:49804:93"/>
frequently mention'd on other occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons also, which can by no means be interpreted as a Condemnation of the Temple then, but rather of the People, as unworthy of so great a Favour. So, in the <hi>Babylonish</hi> Captivity, they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented as <hi>hanging their Harps on the Willows,</hi> when their Adversaries insult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly demanded of them <hi>one of the Songs of Sion,</hi> Psal. cxxxvii. 2, 3, 4. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not therefore conclude, that the Temple-Songs play'd on their Harps, were sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful then, but unseasonable, not suitable to the Condition they were then in, and the Behaviour that became them in the desolation of the Temple. So God threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens to turn their <hi>Feasts into Mourning, and their Songs into Lamentation,</hi> Am. viii. 10. Hos. ii. 11. We must not rherefore say, that their <hi>holy Feasts</hi> or <hi>Songs</hi> were sinful. All that is imply'd thereby, is only this, that they should be so estranged from Joy, that it should find no place in their holiest Offices, even of Religion. So <hi>Job</hi> expresses the sadness of his Condition: <hi>My Harp also is turned into mourning, and my Organ into the Voice of them that Weep,</hi> Job. xxx. 31. So in <hi>Isa.</hi> xxiv. 8. <hi>The mirth of Tabrets ceaseth, the noise of them that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice endeth, the Joy of the Harp ceaseth.</hi>

And in <hi>Ezek.</hi> xxvi. <hi>I will cause the noise of thy Songs to cease, and the sound of thy Harps shall be no more heard.</hi> Who sees not, from these and the like Places, that these Expressions are used to describe a State not Sinful but Penal rather and Calamitous? The same appears from the other things following in this very Text, concerning which we are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting, of the <hi>Revelations.</hi> It follows, <hi>And no Crafts-man of whatsoever Craft he be, shall be found any more in thee.</hi> Will our Adversary therefore say, that all sorts of <hi>Crafts</hi> are here condemn'd as unlawful? It is easie to observe, that there is nothing more foretold in these Words, but the failing of the Trade of <hi>Babylon,</hi> for which she had been so very famous. It follows farther, <hi>And the sound of a Milstone shall be heard no more in thee; and the light of a Candle shall shine no more at all in thee.</hi> Must <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stones</hi> therefore and <hi>Candles</hi> be unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful also? This only shews a Famine that should befall them, and a want of Corn to employ the <hi>Millstone,</hi> as <hi>clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Teeth</hi> for want of Bread to foul them is likewise threatned, <hi>Am.</hi> iv. 6. Teeth as well as Mills are called the <hi>Grinders,</hi> Eccle. xii. 3, 4. It also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes the Disconsolateness of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:49804:94"/>
when they should want the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon comfort of <hi>Light.</hi> Exactly paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel to the Passage in <hi>Jer.</hi> xxv. 10. where it is threatned that <hi>the sound of the Mill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, and the light of the Candle</hi> should <hi>be taken away.</hi> Next it is added, <hi>And the Voice of the Bridegroom, and of the Bride, sholl be heard no more at all in thee.</hi> The Adversary himself will not, I believe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that the rejoycings in <hi>Marriage</hi> are therefore <hi>unlawful.</hi> This is also another way of signifying a very dejected State in the Prophetical <hi>Poetick</hi> Stile. So <hi>Jer.</hi> vii. 34. xvi. 9. xxv. 10. Thus it was counted to have no <hi>share</hi> in those <hi>few</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities of Joy, which were allowed in States not <hi>utterly</hi> ruin'd, at least at <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptial</hi> Festialties. So clear it is, that tho' we should grant that these things were to be understood of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> yet they would not prove the <hi>Sinfulness</hi> of the things of which he was to be <hi>deprived,</hi> but the <hi>Calamity</hi> of the <hi>Deprivation.</hi>

            <p>BUT our Author has an Observation <note place="margin">XXIV. Dr. <hi>Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foots</hi> Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that the <hi>Temple</hi> Worship was wholly <hi>Ceremonious,</hi> and the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue</hi> VVorship wholly <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> is not <hi>true.</hi>
               </note> from the very learned Dr. <hi>Lightfoot,</hi> which if it had been true, would, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, weaken what I have said for Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Musick; <hi>Christ,</hi> says that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Person, <hi>abolish'd the Worship of the Temple as purely Ceremonious; but he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuated the Worship of the Synagogue, read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the Scriptures, Praying, Preaching</hi> and <hi>Singing of Psalms, and Transplanted it into the Christian Church as purely Moral.</hi> For I have already granted that <hi>Instrumental Musick</hi> was used not in the Worship of the <hi>Synagogues,</hi> but of the <hi>Temple.</hi> But there are no <hi>Words</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> that I know of, that could be so much as pretended for shewing what he designed concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these two Worships in <hi>General,</hi> and much less to shew that this was <hi>Christ</hi>'s design concerning them. We have seen withal, that the <hi>Apostles</hi> did <hi>separate</hi> from the <hi>Synagogue</hi> worship, tho' they never did so from that of the <hi>Temple.</hi> This would rather imply the <hi>contrary</hi> to what that great Man has advanc'd, if Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were allow'd to proceed <hi>universally</hi> on either side. But as there is no <hi>Text,</hi> so neither is there any <hi>Reason,</hi> to pass this Judgment concerning both these kinds <hi>universally.</hi> I know not why <hi>singing</hi> of <hi>Psalms</hi> should be counted <hi>Moral.</hi> Especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally according to our Adversaries Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which ascribes its <hi>efficacy</hi> for promot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Devotion,</hi> not to its own <hi>Nature,</hi> but to its <hi>divine Institution.</hi> This must needs take away the <hi>antecedent Reason</hi> of its <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution.</hi> So far it is from allowing it an <hi>Antecedent Reason,</hi> that it must <hi>necessarily</hi> and <hi>universally</hi> oblige <hi>without</hi> any <hi>positive</hi>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:49804:95"/>
Sanction. This is usually thought neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary according to the commonly received notion of a <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature.</hi> And on the contrary the use of <hi>Lots</hi> were taken by the Apostles from the use of the <hi>Temple</hi> Worship, where it was usually made use of, for determining which particular <hi>Priests</hi> of the whole <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> were to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the duty of the <hi>Week.</hi> This could be used by the <hi>Jews</hi> no where but at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> because there was no other <hi>place</hi> where Priests could <hi>lawfully</hi> Officiate. But by the <hi>Apostles</hi> it was made use of not only for choosing a new <hi>Apostle</hi> of their own order, as in the Case of St. <hi>Mathias,</hi> but also for determining the <hi>Persons</hi> that were to be invested with <hi>Ecclesiastical Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotal</hi> Power. And that very <hi>consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> because the <hi>exercise</hi> of the <hi>Evangelical Priesthood</hi> was not <hi>confin'd</hi> to <hi>one place</hi> as that of the <hi>Jewish Priesthood</hi> was, to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem.</hi> This was used so <hi>generally,</hi> that from thence the name of <hi>Clerus</hi> came to be <hi>appropriated</hi> to the <hi>sacred Order</hi> in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to the <hi>Laity,</hi> as I have often shewn elsewhere. It is therefore a plain instance <note place="margin">Diss. <hi>Cyp.</hi> 1.</note> that the <hi>general</hi> way of <hi>Reasoning</hi> will not hold that any thing must be <hi>unlawful now,</hi> on that alone account, that it had been <hi>used</hi> in the Worship of the <hi>Temple.</hi> I know no ground the Doctor could have
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:49804:96"/>
for this Distinction, but that he seems to have believed, that the <hi>Temple</hi> worship was <hi>universally</hi> settled by a <hi>positive</hi> Law of God, as having no <hi>antecedent</hi> reason why it should have obliged without such a <hi>positive</hi> Sanction; and that the <hi>Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue</hi> worship having no <hi>positive</hi> Sanction in the <hi>Scriptures</hi> (without which our <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries</hi> allow no proof of a <hi>positive De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> Sanction) must therefore have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the <hi>Sanction</hi> it <hi>pretended</hi> to from the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>things</hi> themselves, and therefore as <hi>immutable</hi> as those <hi>natures</hi> of <hi>things</hi> from which they thought it was <hi>deriv'd.</hi> This is indeed so far suitable to our Adversaries <hi>Principles,</hi> granted on <hi>popular</hi> receiv'd <hi>Prejudices,</hi> that in things of <hi>this</hi> nature they allowed no <hi>humane</hi> Sanction to be of any force. This <hi>preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi> Supposition did naturaly put them upon finding a <hi>Divine</hi> original for all the <hi>old</hi> Establishment of the Worship of the <hi>Synagogue,</hi> which because they could not pretend to find in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> they were oblig'd to derive from the <hi>Moral</hi> Law, which was indeed suppos'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive its <hi>Authority</hi> from a <hi>divine</hi> Legislati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But the <hi>Moral</hi> Law, being founded, as they thought, on the <hi>Nature</hi> of the things, they must therefore believe its <hi>Obligation</hi> as <hi>Eternal</hi> and <hi>Immutable,</hi> as
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:49804:96"/>
those <hi>Natures</hi> were supos'd to be. So on the contrary, because the <hi>written</hi> Law was written with a <hi>prospect</hi> on one <hi>fixed</hi> Place for their solemn <hi>Assemblies,</hi> which <hi>fixation</hi> was made by a <hi>positive</hi> divine Sanction, which was designedly to <hi>cease</hi> upon the <hi>Destruction</hi> of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the <hi>Dispersion</hi> of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, therefore they think the whole <hi>writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten</hi> Law relating to the <hi>Temple,</hi> was to have an <hi>end</hi> with the <hi>Temple,</hi> for the use of which it was contrived. But neither way does the <hi>Argument proceed</hi> as our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries are concerned for it. The <hi>Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue</hi> Worship not being a thing <hi>expressly</hi> provided for in the <hi>old</hi> Testament) where there is no mention of <hi>Synagogues</hi> in the <hi>latter</hi> Sense of the Word) I should rather have taken for an Argument against the <hi>Reasonings</hi> of the <hi>Nonconformists,</hi> from the Testimonies of the <hi>old</hi> Testament, for the <hi>necessity</hi> of an <hi>express divine</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for every indifferent <hi>Circumstance</hi> of <hi>Divine-Worship</hi> when the whole <hi>kind</hi> of <hi>Synagogue-</hi>Worship cannot pretend to a <hi>divine</hi> Command in the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> And without the Scriptures, there can be no <hi>divine</hi> Command pretended, by <hi>their</hi> Principles, but what is <hi>Moral,</hi> which must therefore be grounded on <hi>Eternal</hi> and <hi>Immutable</hi> Reasons, which will not
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:49804:97"/>
be so easily found for every particular of the Worship of the <hi>Synagogue,</hi> as our Adversaries may fancy before they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider it. Every <hi>atnecedent Reason</hi> will not do. For inded no <hi>Law,</hi> however <hi>positive</hi> can be thought <hi>prudent,</hi> that has not an <hi>antecedent Reason,</hi> that might move the <hi>Legislator</hi> to add his <hi>Sanction</hi> to it. But if that had been alone sufficient to <hi>oblige</hi> the <hi>Subject,</hi> there could have been no <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity</hi> of the <hi>subsequent Law.</hi> The reason therefore requisite for a <hi>moral Law,</hi> musts be such as must hold <hi>necessarily</hi> and <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally,</hi> and so as to expose the Person who is not ruled by it, not only to <hi>incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient</hi> Consequences, and <hi>prejudicial</hi> to his <hi>Temporal</hi> concerns, but so as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve him in the guilt of <hi>sin,</hi> with rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>God,</hi> and the consequent indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite <hi>Effects</hi> af the <hi>divine Displeasurs,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the <hi>natural Consequences</hi> of the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons it <hi>self.</hi> Such Reasons as these, our Adversaries will not be so easily able to find for all the particulars of the <hi>Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue-</hi>Worship, when they shall be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to consider it sedately. I am sure the <hi>Worship</hi> of the <hi>Body,</hi> and of the <hi>Mouth</hi> too may be without <hi>singing,</hi> if they will allow no more <hi>natural</hi> conduciveness to <hi>Vocal</hi> Musick for raising the <hi>Imagination</hi> and the <hi>Affections,</hi> than they do to that
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:49804:97"/>
which is <hi>Instrumental.</hi> The <hi>Reasons</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the <hi>things</hi> Sung, receive no more <hi>accession</hi> of <hi>strength</hi> by their being <hi>Sung Vocally,</hi> than they would by being <hi>Sung Instrumentally.</hi> I am apt to think the whole <hi>Synagogue-</hi>Worship was introduc'd after the <hi>Captivity</hi> perhaps instead of the <hi>Schools</hi> of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> that is, after that <hi>ordinary</hi> way of Educating <hi>Prophets</hi> in <hi>Schools</hi> had fail'd of which we find no more mention after the <hi>Captivity.</hi> From that time forwards the <hi>failing</hi> of the <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary</hi> use of <hi>Prophets</hi> is owned in the Scriptures. Ps. lxxiv. 9. Nehem. vii. 65. <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Contr.</hi> Api<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> and <hi>Josephus,</hi> as well as in the less cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Testimonies of the <hi>Rabbins.</hi> At least as to <hi>Colleges</hi> and <hi>Schools.</hi> Whilst, those ordinary Bodies of the <hi>Prophets</hi> were still in <hi>being,</hi> the People seem to have made the same use of them, as was afterwards made of the <hi>Synagogues,</hi> for performing those <hi>parts</hi> of the <hi>Offices</hi> of their <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> with them, which by the <hi>Law,</hi> were allowed to be performed <hi>elsewhere</hi> than at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> 2. Kings iv. 23. The <hi>new Moons</hi> and the <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> are mentioned as ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>occasions</hi> of having recourse to them. If so, the whole <hi>Synagogue</hi> way of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship must have been settled by <hi>prudential</hi> Provisions, which could alone take place upon the failing of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Prophesy.</hi>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:49804:98"/>
Especially if we will not allow any proof of <hi>Prophetick</hi> discoveries, by those <hi>few</hi> Prophets which even <hi>then</hi> remain'd after the Prophetick <hi>Colleges</hi> were generally dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved. This our Adversaries are <hi>averse</hi> to on <hi>other</hi> occasions. If they be true to themselves on this occasion also, I do not foresee how it is possible for them to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend any <hi>Divine</hi> Revelation for this way of Worship in the <hi>Synagogues,</hi> from those few <hi>Prophets</hi> yet remaining, whose <hi>Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> we have extant. And how can they possibly prove a <hi>Revelation</hi> that is no where <hi>Written?</hi> What then will become of their <hi>Negative</hi> Arguments from our present <hi>Scriptures?</hi> Nor does their <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> hold on the other side, that every <hi>particular</hi> of the <hi>Temple</hi> Worship, must for that only Reason, because it was so, be <hi>unlawful</hi> now. They might indeed infer that its <hi>confined</hi> use in the <hi>Temple</hi> must <hi>cease,</hi> when the <hi>confinement</hi> of all <hi>sacerdotal</hi> Offices to that <hi>Temple,</hi> was its self <hi>abrogated</hi> and <hi>repealed.</hi> But they very well know our present Dispute, is not whether <hi>Instrumental-Musick</hi> be to be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined</hi> now, as it was formerly, to that particular <hi>Temple.</hi> They might say, far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the <hi>Obligation</hi> it <hi>then</hi> had from that <hi>Mosaical</hi> Sanction, is expired when the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Sanction is it self <hi>repeal'd</hi>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:49804:98"/>
from whence that <hi>Obligation</hi> was deriv'd. But neither is that our present Question, whether the same <hi>Instrumental-Musick</hi> shall oblige us <hi>now,</hi> on account of that <hi>Mosaic</hi> Imposition, which even <hi>then</hi> was never intended for <hi>uncircumcis'd Gentiles,</hi> such as we are <hi>now.</hi> All that can be thence inferred by any <hi>regular</hi> Reasoning, is, that, upon the <hi>Revocation</hi> of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement</hi> of <hi>sacerdotal</hi> Worship to the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Instrumental-Musick</hi> returned to its own <hi>Nature</hi> as it was before, either to remain as it was at first, <hi>Indifferent,</hi> or to <hi>receive,</hi> or <hi>retain,</hi> some <hi>other</hi> Sanction distinct from that. But that it must be thenceforward <hi>unlawful,</hi> is more than I think our Adversaries will ever be able to prove from this concession alone, that it was formerly a <hi>part</hi> of the Worship of the <hi>Temple.</hi>

Worship only to <hi>come,</hi> our Adversaries would do well to consider how it could have been used by the <hi>Jews.</hi> even in the time of the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Law. For it is certain that the <hi>Jews</hi> used the Worship of the <hi>Organs</hi> of their <hi>Bodies</hi> together with their <hi>Instrumental</hi> Musick, not only of their <hi>Mouths</hi> as we do, but also of their <hi>Feet,</hi> in their <hi>Religious Dances.</hi> If <hi>bodily</hi> Worship being used at the same time with it made a false signification in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with the <hi>futurity</hi> which it is pretended to signifie <hi>now,</hi> Why should it not do so <hi>then</hi> also?

No other Reason is pretended, but the general precarious <hi>presumption</hi> that <hi>all</hi> usages then practis'd, that were not <hi>Moral,</hi> must needs be so.

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:49804:108"/>
no reason why they should be <hi>ungrateful</hi> to the <hi>Essenes</hi> themselves, who were of all the <hi>Jews</hi> best dispos'd to the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion.

alone, <hi>before</hi> the <hi>Gospel Revelations</hi> had <hi>altered</hi> the Case, but not <hi>afterwards.</hi> But then these <hi>Reasonings</hi> conclude no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing against the very same <hi>abrogated Symbols,</hi> if practiced in <hi>unity</hi> with the <hi>uncircumcis'd Believers</hi> much less if the same things had been observ'd by the <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Power</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> without regard to the <hi>old</hi> Imposition of <hi>Moses.</hi> For the <hi>latter</hi> could oblige <hi>all</hi> its own <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi> which the <hi>former</hi> could not do, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only <hi>obligatory</hi> to the <hi>Jewish Nation.</hi> Here therefore there was no <hi>Enmity,</hi> no <hi>Wall of Partition,</hi> which might any way tend to the <hi>dissolution</hi> of their common <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Communion.</hi> Withal it is plain that this <hi>Reasoning</hi> extends to no <hi>other Jewish</hi> Customs but those only who were thought to entitle to some <hi>mystical Benefits</hi> represented and conveyed by them, till God had declared it otherwise by his new <hi>Revelations.</hi> And therefore it is to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, in reference to this design, to find a thing <hi>represented</hi> by the <hi>Jewish Symbol,</hi> unless it be a <hi>mystical Benefit,</hi> to which it was to <hi>entitle</hi> from <hi>God</hi> as a <hi>Covenanting Symbol</hi> Instituted by <hi>him.</hi> In vain there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore does our Adversary pretend that <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental Musick shadowed</hi> our Worship with the <hi>Organs</hi> of our <hi>Bodies.</hi> Had that been true, yet it had been nothing
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:49804:117"/>
to the purpose in relation to the design of these <hi>reasonings.</hi> That had been a <hi>Duty,</hi> not a <hi>Benefit,</hi> which is plainly supposed as pretended to in all the <hi>Instances</hi> of these <hi>Reasonings.</hi> It was their <hi>losing</hi> the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> conveyed by the <hi>shadow,</hi> on which all the force of the Argument depends, that is drawn from the Appellation of <hi>shadows.</hi> The <hi>Weakness</hi> of the <hi>Elements</hi> or <hi>Rudiments</hi> of the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Law, as ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentative in this Case, implies their <hi>insufficiency</hi> to convey the <hi>Benefits,</hi> as their Beggarliness implys their Inability to confer the Mystical Riches that were expected from them. If therefore our Adversary will make <hi>Instrumental Musick</hi> a <hi>Shadow</hi> or a <hi>Rudiment,</hi> he should bethink himself of some <hi>Mystical Benefit</hi> represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and conveyed <hi>by it</hi> under the <hi>Law,</hi> but <hi>now</hi> conveyed by some <hi>other</hi> Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion succeeding it under the <hi>Gospel.</hi> For this is absolutely requisite to make it <hi>now</hi> an empty <hi>Shadow,</hi> and a <hi>weak and beggarly Element.</hi> And what may that be? Is it the admitting us to the <hi>Joys</hi> of the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Society,</hi> represented by <hi>Instrumental Musick?</hi> And why may not the like use of <hi>Instrumental Musick</hi> entitle us to that <hi>now</hi> as well as <hi>represent</hi> it? I have shewn that the <hi>Gospel Symbols</hi> are supposed as best qualified to give us a <hi>title</hi> to any
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:49804:117"/>
thing <hi>Heavenly,</hi> by the <hi>Reasonings</hi> of the <hi>New Testament.</hi> I have shewn, that by the same <hi>Reasonings</hi> the same <hi>Title</hi> is <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied</hi> to the <hi>legal Symbols</hi> in a Statee of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration</hi> from the <hi>Communion</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> I have shewn that the <hi>contrary</hi> is supposed, by the same <hi>Reasonings,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Symbols</hi> of the <hi>Church, that they,</hi> and they <hi>alone,</hi> are supposed <hi>sufficient</hi> to <hi>perform</hi> what is <hi>represented,</hi> and <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolically Covenanted</hi> for by them. The <hi>weakness</hi> and <hi>beggarliness</hi> of what would otherwise have been useful, do more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern our <hi>Adversaries</hi> than <hi>Us,</hi> who practice even their <hi>Vocal Musick,</hi> as the <hi>Jews</hi> did, in a <hi>Seperation</hi> from the truly <hi>Original Apostolical Communion.</hi> The good God open their Eyes, and make them truly sensible of it. Thus I think I have obviated all that <hi>has</hi> been said or <hi>can</hi> be said, from our Adversaries <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> with relation to my <hi>own</hi> principal Argument? And I have not leisure to follow him in things less necessary to my own design.</p>
