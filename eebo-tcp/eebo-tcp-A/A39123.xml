         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>I Here preſent thee with a ſhort Syſtem of <hi>Mathematical Medicine;</hi> a Work altogether New, extracted out of the Writings of that Learned and Eminent Mathematician and Famous Phyſician D. <hi>P.</hi> late Profeſſour of Medicine in the Univerſity of <hi>Leyden.</hi> To him alone is due the Glory of this Invention: and he it is that firſt laid the Foundation of this <hi>Aereal Caſtle:</hi> and he only is able to finiſh the Building; and bring this great Work to its wiſhed Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. If thou reap any Advantage by this Treatiſe (as I hope thou ſhalt) thou knows to whom Thanks is due. Yet I cannot but ſay, that the Tranſlator deſerves ſome ſmall tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of Praiſe; for had it not been for him, it might have lyen buried for ever in the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62611:3"/>
Ruines of old <hi>Rome,</hi> out of which he has dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it with a great deal of Pains and Care; and ſo been the happy Inſtrument by which this great Bleſſing is conveighed to all theſe of this Iſland, who underſtand not the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Beaſt. Tho' this Work may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be called New, having never been brought to any tollerable Perfection before; yet it was attempted of old by that Famous Mountebank <hi>Crinas Maſſilienſis,</hi> who was ſo preciſe and exact in his Patients Diet, that he would not allow them to Eat or Drink, but with regard of Times and Seaſons, obſerving the Courſe of the Stars, chooſing good Days and Hours, and walking always by his Almanack and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phimerides, and all this by his great skill in the Mathematicks. But Mountebank as he was, he turned <hi>Theſſalus,</hi> as great a Quack as himſelf, out of the Sadle, <hi>Cum arte ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minata ut cautior religioſorq, ad ſyderum motus ex Ephemeride Mathematica cibos dando, horaſque obſervando autoritate eum praeceſſit:</hi> And found a way by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical jugler Tricks, to live like a Prince, and leave a good round Sum to his Heirs. This Fellow at beſt was nothing but a cunning
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62611:3"/>
Rogue, and believed no more that Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks were of any uſe in Medicine, that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the Moon is a <hi>Chesſhire</hi> Cheeſe; but only made uſe of them as a Trick to get Money. But here you have this Doctrine ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly inculcat, and ſupported with all the Reaſon it is capable of, and Prophecy too. You have not here a meer Theory and abſtract Speculation of this <hi>Mathematical Medicine,</hi> but many practical Concluſions regularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, and ſeveral particular Caſes handled. But <hi>Reader,</hi> that I may not foreſtal thy Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by a too high Commendation of this Work, I will ſay no more, but recommend to thee to read impartially this little Treatiſe; by which thou ſhalt be able to judge of the real worth of this New Medicine, and of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits will accrue to Mankind by it. I have ſubjoined to this, A Diſcourſe of <hi>Certainty,</hi> according to the Principles of the ſame Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Author; which is every whitt as good Divinity, as the other is Phyſick. The one without the other would have been but lame and defective: But both together make a compleat Work.</p>

Paths, where they can hardly ſhun falling into Bogues and Ditches. Men for the moſt part love Extreams, and as the Poet ſaith,

                     </q>
The Way to true Knowledge is ſtrait and narrow, and there are Dangers on the right Hand and on the left, and he that would eſcape both muſt keep the golden Mean, and ſteer a very ſteddie Courſe, neither ſtanding too far out to Sea, nor keeping too near the Shoar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For whether we be ſwallowed up in the Deep, or Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrak'd among Rocks and Shelfs, it's much the ſame thing.

                  <p>Some admire the Ancients too much, and others too little. The former are ſo mad
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62611:5"/>
in love with Antiquity; that nothing will reliſh or go down with them, that is not ſtale with Time, and ſeaſoned with the Salt of old Age: The Later nauſeat what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is not of Yeſterday, as muſty and corrupt, and can digeſt nothing, but what is dreſſed with the Sauce of Novelty. As the Firſt have but a very weak Stomack and bad Digeſtion; ſo the Laſt have a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved Apetite and vitiat Pallat. Thoſe for the moſt part are Men of a moroſe Temper and ſevere Brow: theſe have light Mercurial Noddles, are unſtable as the Water, and toſſed about with every Wind of Doctrine. Both the one and the other may be known by their Way, as the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of ſome Herbs by their Signatures. There a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gravity, and here a <hi>French</hi> Levity; the One for the moſt part of the ſame Mind, the Other ſcarce two Hours of the ſame, or two Minutes in the ſame place: Every Thing puts them by their Mind, and every new Object captivats their weak Fancy. Something may be made of the Firſt, becauſe they are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally fixed: But the Second are fit for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62611:6"/>
but to be Weather-cocks: Nothing can fix or ſetle them but old Age and Time; and then for the moſt part it is out of time: For when the Spirits are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaporat they become ſilly and dull, as Wine when it is over fermented or fretted grows vapid, and is good for nothing. Both Extreams then muſt be ſhunned, and we muſt chooſe the midle Way: admire the Ancients, and juſtly eſteem the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns; they laid the Foundation, and we muſt rear the Fabrick after the Model they have given us, if ever we deſign to make a regular piece of Work, and finiſh the Building.</p>
                  <p>But among all the miſtaken Notions and falſe Ideas of Medicine I have met with, there is none ſo ridiculous and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, as that of a late Sect that is ſprung up among us, like <hi>Jona</hi>'s Gourd in a Nights time, and I believe will wither in another. This Sect I call the <hi>Mathematical,</hi> to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh it from the other Sects of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, the <hi>Empirical, Methodical</hi> and <hi>Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</hi> Its chief Patron is one D. <hi>P.</hi> an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert Phyſician, and learned Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62611:6"/>
This learned Man will needs have the knowledge of the Mathematicks ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for Phyſicians, not only as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument to digg and prepare our Minds for the Seeds of all Arts, as well as this of Medicine (which is a Miſtake many have fallen into more than he) but as having an Affinity and peculiar Congruity with it, and without which it can never be cultivat as it ought, or bring forth Fruit, Twenty, Thirty, or an Hundred fold; no more than Corn can grow without the Dew of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and benign Influence of the Sun. But whatever be in this, that Mathematicks are neceſſary for a Phyſician, I am ſure Phyſick is very neceſſary for ſome Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticians, and that a good ſwinging Doſe too. But that you may not take this for a Romance (as readily a wiſe Man will) I ſhall cite you two or three Teſtimonies of the Dr's. that in the Mouth of theſe Witneſſes the truth of what I ſay may be eſtabliſhed.</p>

who does not underſtand its Nature, and how it is formed and put together; ſo no Man ſhould take upon him to Cure Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes without the knowledge of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks. Who can ſay this is not a juſt parallel, ſince the Lines, though drawn out infinitly, will never meet to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity? Or who can refuſe this for a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, ſince I'le warrand it for as good as any of the Doctor's I am to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine afterwards? Who doubts but the Body of Man, in ſome ſenſe, may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a <hi>Machine?</hi> Yet it is of ſuch a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Structure and curious Contrivance (for we are wonderfully made) has ſo many ſmall Parts and Springs, ſuch variety of Motions, &amp;c. that none either knows, or can know, but the Great Artificer that firſt made it, and ſet it a going. All we can do is diligently to obſerve its natural Motions, and take notice what diſturbs their Regularity, and endeavour to find out by Experience, aſſiſted with Reaſon, what may put it right again. And this I think may be done without the Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks. As for Example, Men found that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62611:9"/>
raw Meat troubled the Stomack, and was of hard digeſtion, and therefore they try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it boyl'd and roaſted, &amp;c. and found it did a great deal better. They found likewiſe, that that which was agreeable to them, and of eaſie Digeſtion while in Health, would either not go down, or increaſed their Diſeaſe, if it did, when Sick; and this taught them the uſe of Broaths, Ptiſans, &amp;c. And thus came in the Dietetick Part of Medicine. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver when any inteſtine Commotion was raiſed by Surfeit or Drunkenneſs, they found, that upon the expelling the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, the War was at an end. And thus they learned the uſefulneſs of Vomiting, Purging, &amp;c. When in Fevers or violent Head-acks, &amp;c. the Noſe fell a Bleeding, the Fever abated, and the Pain evaniſhed. And thence they learned the uſe of Blooding. And thus came in the Pharmacutick, or Curative Part of Medicine. And all this without ſo much as once dreaming of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks.</p>
                  <p>Theſe were the Firſt Lineaments and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Draught of that Noble and Excellent
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62611:9"/>
Art. But ſomething was ſtill a wanting to finiſh the Picture, and this was Reaſon, without which bare Experience more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently hurts, than helps. This is that which weighs all in an equal Ballance (without the aſſiſtance of the Staticks) conſiders all the Indications and Contre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>indications, ariſing from the Nature of the Diſeaſe, the Cauſes and urgent Symptoms, the Age and Conſtitution of the Patient, the Seaſon, Sympathies and Antipathies, &amp;c. And there is no Mathematicks in all this. Moreover this <hi>Machine</hi> is of a quite different nature from artificial Ones, which can be taken down and ſet up again at One's pleaſure; and by this means ſoon mended when any thing is amiſs: But ſuch an Experiment as this, I doubt would prove a litle too<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> dangerous on the the Body of Man: For tho' it is eaſie to take it down, all the matter is to put it together again, and ſet it a going. I would adviſe theſe Mechaniſts to try the Experiment firſt on ſome of themſelves: For there is reaſon to ſuſpect that ſomething is wrong in their Clock-work that reaſon thus, and if it
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62611:10"/>
ſucceed well, they need not doubt of Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice. And for their incouragement, I propoſe to them the Example of that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Witch <hi>Medea,</hi> who alſo tried it firſt on a Sheep which ſhe diſmembred and boyled with certain Herbs, that were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the influence and dominion of ſuch and ſuch Planets, whoſe nature and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are only known to the Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians.</p>

room in the World and Common-wealth of Learning, and are very good Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, while they keep within the bounds preſcribed them by Nature, and do not wander beyond the limits of their own Orb: But if they come to make Incurſions on the Territories of anorher Vortex, they may chance to ſhare with the Comets in their fate. <hi>Oportet vivere couvenienter Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae,</hi> ſays the wiſe Stoick. Every thing has its Limits fixed by Nature, which it ſhould not paſs. Property is that which makes Kingdoms &amp; States flouriſh in Wealth, Peace and Honour: And if that be taken away, all goes to ruine. And the Paralel holds exactly well in the Common-wealth of Learning: For Divinity, Medicine, Law and Mathematicks, have all their diſtinct Provinces, and may live very well in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy together, but can never be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to one anothers Laws. But if any Man will needs join what Nature has di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, I wiſh him Joy, and conclude with the Poet.</p>

                  <p>I find then the Rock on which all the Phyſicians has ſplit, is Philoſophy: For whenever this got into Medicine it ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all, and the Phyſicians divided into as many Sects as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Now here is the Diſeaſe, but where is the Cure? Many hitherro have attempted

it, but all in vain: Till at laſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor fairly undertook it, which I wiſh prove not worſe than rhe Diſeaſe. Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine muſt then be ſeparat from Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, and emancipat from the Tyranny of all its Sects, and broughr under the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of the Mathematicks: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Phyſical Cauſes that diſturb the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth of Medicine, muſt be expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led its borders, as Diſturbers of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Peace, and a new Colony of Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Cauſes, theſe Bulls, or rather Monſters in Medicine, muſt be planted in their place. But that which crowns the Work, is the Method of the Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, which we muſt imitat in building this Aetherial, or Aereal Caſtle, call it as you pleaſe.</p>
                  <p>The firſt thing then to be done is, to part Medicine and Philoſophy, which is but juſt; for they have been too long Brethren in Iniquity. Therefore all ye who mind to excel in this Art, ſhun Philoſophy as ye would do the Pox, and ſtudy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks if ever ye deſign to arrive at Perfection.

                     <q>When Men firſt began (ſays our Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour) to follow the ſtudy of Medicine and Philoſophy, for the good of the Body, or benefit of the Mind, never the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the occaſions for Medicine were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry frequent, but for Philoſophy only caſual. For our Predeceſſors of old fed on Corn and Catle, and led a poor mean Life, expoſed to all the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences of the Weather, and felt the hurt of Heat and Cold, that is, they fell ſick before they thought of providing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with Cloaths or Houſes. Thoſe were the firſt beginnings of Diſeaſes, and theſe the firſt Remedies. But their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle alſo being of a ſhort Life, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Diſeaſes then, as well as now, brought them under a neceſſity of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Medicine, and theſe that Cured them were ſaid to help or aſſiſt Men. For he that keeps one from ſtarving
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62611:16"/>
ſeems to ſave his Life. But Men began to ſtudy Philoſophy, after they had found out by Experience the Virtues of Remedies, and might ſafely, and at their own leiſure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> examine the Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of things.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Is not this a very learned Diſcourſe to prove that Medicine is older than Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, becauſe the occaſions for the one were more frequent than the other? When Men firſt began to Hear and See, the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of Seeing were more frequent: For turn your Eyes what way you pleaſe, ſome Object always preſents it ſelf: But the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of Hearing were leſs frequent and caſual for you may turn your Ear twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty way and hear nothing at all: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Seeing is older than Hearing. I grant Neceſſity is the Mother of Arts, and that which is moſt neceſſary probably was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that which is leſs ſo. But, if I be not miſtaken, Mens Minds were ſick be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Bodies, and conſequently had ſooner need of Phyſick. But tho' this do not hold, there is another Argument be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond exception, which is, That Man was
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62611:16"/>
created a reaſonable Creature, to whom it was as natural to contemplate the Works of his Maker, and to ſearch after, and inquire into the Cauſes of Things, as to Eat, Drink or Sleep, and perhaps a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more: And I think what is Natural takes place of that which is Adventitious, as Medicine may be called. For though Man had ſtood in his Integrity, he had notwithſtanding of that been a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher: But I doubt there would have been place for Phyſick. Moreover, it is down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right falſe, that ever occaſions for Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine were ſo frequent as theſe for Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, which being nothing but <hi>Naturae rerum contemplatio,</hi> as <hi>Celſus</hi> calls it, finds Objects every where: Whereas Phyſick is confin'd to the Body of Man, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo far concerned with other things, as they have any relation to that: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the Doctor's Reaſon hold, Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy muſt be the elder of the Two.</p>
                  <p>But what though I ſhould grant that Medicine is older than Philoſophy, and once ſubſiſted without it, it will not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that it was better ſo than with it. For
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62611:17"/>
this Art was a long time lame and defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, conſiſting of a few Experiments, and ill made Obſervations, until the time of the Divine <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> who firſt dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted and ſet in order theſe things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were confuſed, and licked this rude Lump into a Form; and he it was that firſt inſtitute the <hi>Medicina rationalis,</hi> join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Reaſon to Experience: And ſo brought Philoſophy in into this Art, in which it is ſo neceſſary, that it can no more be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, than a Ship without a Rudder. What can be more neceſſary for a Phyſician than Philoſophy? Not the Jargon of the Schools, or that which evaporats into vain Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and contents it ſelf with bare Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: But that which <hi>Hippocrat</hi> and <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leu,</hi> and the other ancient Hero's of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine followed, which was to conſider things not in their abſolute Natures, but in reference to the Body of Man: But

                  <p>But the Profeſſor may alledge, that he is not againſt Philoſophy in Medicine, but only maintains that it ſhould be free from all the Sects of the Philoſophers. Why what Evil have they done? <hi>Quid meruere boves?</hi> What hurt does Medicine ſuſtain, whether the Phyſician be Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patetick or Carteſian?

                  <p>But there is ſomething more than the Philoſophy I have mentioned, to make a Man a good Phyſician, that is an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sober and Temperat Phyſician, which is, Moral Philoſophy (or rather Chriſtian Morality) which is ſo neceſſary to the

                     <p>The moſt ancient Phyſicians were of opinion, That Diſeaſes came from the Anger of the gods, and Aſtronomy was firſt cultivat by the moſt ancient Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, and at the ſame time the Stars were called by the Names of the gods. <hi>Erg:</hi>

                     <p>However ridiculous you may think theſe Arguments, they are every whit as concluſive as the Profeſſor's, only with this difference, that theſe conclude no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, while the Doctor's, by a Trick of <hi>Leger-de-main,</hi> prove the quite contrary of what he deſigns. For he tells us, that the old Phyſicians firſt treated of theſe Diſeaſes that follow the change of the Seaſons, becauſe they believed that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes came from the Anger of the gods: Whereas this very Belief made them ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect thoſe we properly call Diſeaſes, looking upon them as altogether ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, and thinking there was no other way to remove them, but by appeaſing their angry Dieties with Sacrifices and Prayers.

The Second is of the ſame Mettal, and is ſo far from the Truth, that the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary follows from this very Opinion, that Medicine is older than Philoſophy. Whence it's clear, that the Dr's. Argument cuts its own Throat, and is truly <hi>Felo de ſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Philoſophy being now ſent a packing, and the phyſical Cauſes at it's Heels, let us proceed to the Work, and purſue cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this Method of the Aſtronomers, in order to the eſtabliſhing of certain Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. <q>Theſe (ſays our Orator, Parag.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62611:22"/>
10,) did not receive into their Art the Opinions of Orators, nor made uſe of Fables which might pleaſe the common People, for explaining the Motion of the Stars; but by a long train of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations made in divers places, and at ſundry times, and by comparing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the <hi>Phoenomena</hi> of the motions of the Heavens, by a Method familiar to themſelves, and uſeful to all, did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine theſe Powers, by which Bodies in motion did move towards other Bodies, either in motion or reſt.</q> And this is the Method by which we are to find out theſe Principles in Medicine, that are as certain as theſe things we know by our Senſes, as the Doctor alledgeth Pag. 14. and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which Men skilful in Mathematicks, and freeſt from Prejudices are agreed. <hi>Par.</hi> 6. <q>And do we ſtill doubt (ſays he) that Medicine is to be brought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection the ſame way? For indeed all bodies are of the ſame Nature, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one may be changed into any other of what kind ſoever; and ſo all Bodies whatſoever their bulk or ſize be, are
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62611:22"/>
ſubject to the common Events of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Mutations. Whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that the Laws and Affections of the Fluids and Canals in the Body of Man, may be defined, when either we ſhall have made more Obſervations, or rightly compared theſe which are made already.</q> 
                        <hi>Parag.</hi> 11.</p>
                     <p>Can any thing be better ſaid? Is not our lot fallen in happy times, in which we ſhall ſee this Conjectural Art erected in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Science, and ſetled on ſuch ſure Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, by which we may as certainly Cure Diſeaſes and foretel their Events, as the Aſtronomers do the Eclipſes of the Sun and Moon, the riſing and ſetting of the Stars, &amp;c. But ſince the moſt part of Phyſicians are ignorant of this Method, it were Charity in the Dr. to furuiſh us with Ephemerides's, by which we might make yearly Almanacks of Diſeaſes and their Cures.</p>
                     <p>But before I come to the Examination of this learned Speech, I muſt tell you that the Doctor has deſtroyed the Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of theſe Principles in his Problem <hi>de</hi>
                        <pb n="44" facs="tcp:62611:23"/>
                        <hi>Inventoribus,</hi> &amp;c. For there he tells us that <hi>nothing that depends upon the faith of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory,</hi> as the Principles of Aſtronomy do, <hi>can ever be ſo certain as theſe things we know by our Senſes:</hi> And here he tells us, that the Principles of Phyſick muſt, like thoſe of the Aſtronomers, be as certain as the Objects of our Senſes, <hi>i. e.</hi> They muſt be both as certain, and not as certain at the ſame time, which is a downright Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. Whence you may obſerve, that theſe who contradict themſelves, as well as Lyers, had need of a good Memory.</p>
                     <p>Now all this Jargon about ſuch Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, is a Tale of a Tub, a meer Romance of the Doctor's own making, the ſpawn of his own Imagination, and are only to be found there, where he had e'en beſt keep them, for few elſe will venture to harbour ſuch dangerous Gueſts.</p>
                     <p>Nothing can be of more fatal conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence in the practice of Medicine, than this idle Notion and vain Conceit. For he that pretends to ſuch Principles, may venture on any thing, and ſet up for Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſeaſes as certainly, as the Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:62611:23"/>
can define the Motions of the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial Bodies, which none but a Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bank or Quack-ſalver will ever pretend to. But ſince one of the charactariſtick Marks of theſe Principles is, That they muſt be ſuch about which the Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians do agree, why are they ſo cruel as not to agree, and give us a printed Liſt of them, that we may not practiſe any more in the Dark, and ſuffer Men to die after the old faſhion? But what ſhall we do in the mean time? Let us e'en be jog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging on after the old manner, and do what is moſt Probable and Reaſonable, till our Deliverance come: For he that will venture to do nothing in Medicine without a Demonſtration, may chance to make both his Patiens and himſelf ſhare with <hi>Buridanus</hi>'s Aſs, which coming to a place where two ways met, and having no Demonſtration for taking the one before the other, ſtood ſtill and dyed of Hunger. In which I think ſhe was <hi>Troppo Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tico,</hi> which is in plain <hi>Engliſh</hi> a Fool.</p>
                     <p>But ſhould not the Phyſicians in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Aſtronomers, make Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:62611:24"/>
at different times and divers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and compare theſe together, and not take up Principles at random from the Opinions of Orators? This Orator has no reaſon to be affraid that Phyſicians will take their Principles from him. And whereas he ſays, They ſhould make Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, &amp;c. What elſe have they been doing above theſe 2000 Years? not in imitation of the Aſtronomers, for Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine ſeems to be older than Aſtronomy, (at leaſt according to the Doctor) but of the Great <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> (whoſe Aphoriſms are ſo many Concluſions drawn from a long tract of Obſervations) or rather of Nature it ſelf; without ſo much as ever dreaming of imitating the Aſtronomers, more than the Man in the Moon. For wiſe Men always knew and know ſtill, that Medicine is of a quite other Nature than Aſtronomy. For after they had made their Obſervations and compared them, they found that different places re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired frequently different Methods: and that one thing was expedient at <hi>Rome,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and a third in <hi>France.</hi>
                        <pb n="47" facs="tcp:62611:24"/>
And not only ſo, but that the Age, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, Manner of Life, Sympathies, Antipathies, &amp;c. was to be taken notice of. Hence it is that <hi>Celſus</hi> ſaith, <hi>Quod vix ulla perpetua praecepta Medicinalis ars neceperit.</hi> And in another place, <hi>Ergo vetuſtiſſimus Auctor</hi> Hippocrates <hi>dixit, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deri oportere &amp; communia &amp; propria intuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem.</hi> Hence alſo it is that Medicine is called by <hi>Pliny, Ars Interpolaris.</hi> But that in Aſtronomy in was far otherwiſe. For they found that their Obſervations agreed, and that the Celeſtial Bodies obſerved the ſame Laws in all places, that the Sun in an Year, the Moon in a Month, &amp;c. finiſhed their Courſe, and returned to the ſame place. Any Body that underſtands the very firſt Principles of Medicine, knows that it is an eſtabliſh'd Maxime among Phyſicians, <hi>A juvantibus &amp; nocentibus opti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma petitur Indicatio;</hi> which for ever debars it from the benefit of theſe Principles the Doctor pretends to find out by this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtronomical, or rather Lunatical Method.</p>
                     <p>But to ſhow you how abſurd this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, and how inconſiſtent the Doctor
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62611:25"/>
is with himſelf; conſider but a litle, that the great Deſign he propoſes to himſelf is, to ſet up Medicine <hi>ab omni Philoſopho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum ſecta liberam,</hi> free from all Sects and Hypotheſis whatſoever; and yet at the ſame time he will have us to imitate the Aſtronomers who are divided into Sects, and have different Syſtems: that is, we muſt follow them, by not following them at all, which I think is the ſafeſt way by farr. Is not this a hard Task-maſter, to require the ſame Tale of Bricks, and yet give us no Straw? This brings us under the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Bondage, and puts us in a far worſe condition than ever we were at <hi>Rome,</hi> according to the Doctor's Dream, which is no more to be regarded here, than in any other part of the <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which is one continued Miſtake from the beginning to the end. What is the Matter? ſhall not the Phyſicians be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to frame to themſelves different Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſes (if they pleaſe) for explaining the <hi>Phoenomena</hi> of Diſeaſes, as well as the Aſtronomers for explaining theſe of the Celeſtial Bodies? No, by no means: For
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62611:25"/>
Medicine was free born, and lived a long time ſo, and will never thrive till it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover its ancient Liberty, and enjoy its native Prerogative, and have nothing to do with any Sect, Party or Faction what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>
                     <p>But if the Doctor will needs have us follow this Method, why has he not told us how far, whether at a diſtance or ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or faſt and cloſs at the heels? Which latter if we do, we may chance to break our Necks, or fall into ſome Ditch or Bogg, as theſe who have <hi>Ignis fatuus</hi> or <hi>Willawiſps</hi> for their Guide: Yea, into theſe very Inconveniencies he would have us to ſhun. Nothing can be of more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous conſequence, than to ſet up a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical Art, and a ſpeculative Science upon the ſame foot, For in this there can be no hazard in framing and following as many different Hypotheſes as you pleaſe. What prejudice does the World ſuſtain, I pray, whether the Sun be the Center about which the Planets dance (allowing even the dull Earth to be one of the Ring) as Maids about a May-pole? Or the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:62611:26"/>
Earth the fixed Point about which theſe glorious Luminaries turn? In all this <hi>nobis nec ſeritur, nec metitur.</hi> But if Aſtronomy were ſuch an Art as Phyſick is, all theſe Hypotheſes which before were innocent, would have more fatal Conſequences, than any I know in Medicine, and change the very Methods of Curing. Wherefore let us take a Ramble through the Heavens, and ſuppoſe for a litle, that theſe Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial Creatures may be ſubject to Collicks, Gouts, Gravels, Epilepſies, and all that Troop of Diſeaſes that flew out of <hi>Pand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

nothing can be more proper than great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuations by Purging, Blooding, &amp;c. and puting her under a ſtrict Regimen, for <hi>ſine Cerere &amp; Bacho friget Venus.</hi> Then ſpake <hi>Ptolomey</hi> thus. You have ſpoke very well (ſaid he) both as to the Diſeaſe and its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediat Cauſe, the knowledge of which is not ſufficient, as you very well remarked: But, if I be not miſtaken, you have miſs'd the Procatartick Cauſe altogether, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of your wrong Hypotheſis: Here it is that you and I differ in the Cauſe, and I am affraid we diſagree alſo in the Cure. My Opinion is then, that neither the Moon nor the Earth is to blame. For the Lady Moon is not in Love, as you alledge, and what ſhe did to <hi>Endymion,</hi> proceeded not from an amourous Wantoneſs (which I confeſs is a kind of Madneſs) but from meer Generoſity, or rather Charity, which is a Virtue, and can never lead any Body out of the way.

And for the Earth, I maintain ſhe is fixed to her Poſt, and her Ear nail'd to the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and cannot in the leaſt budge thence, and therefore ſhe cannot be the Cauſe. For your Hypotheſis that makes the Earth turn round is falſe; for it is only the reeling and turning of your own Heads makes you imagine ſo, as theſe who have a <hi>Vertigo,</hi> imagine all things turn round. The Cauſe then muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly ly in the Sun, who is a preciſe kind of Gentleman, and will not ſtep out of his Road to pleaſe any Body, but will needs make Viſits both to the Head and Tail of the Dragon, according to his old cuſtom; by which means, his poor Siſter, who cannot live without his preſence one Moment, falls into fainting Fits, in ſome of which ſhe may chance to die one time or another. And therefore, in my humble Opinion, the Sun ought to be ſoundly put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with <hi>Hellebore,</hi> and Blooded <hi>ad animi deliquium,</hi> according to the Method of the Ancients, for his Diſeaſe is certainly a
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:62611:28"/>
downright Madneſs: For who but a Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man would make any Body run the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of their L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>fe for a meer Viſit of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony. And leſt you may think it ſtrange that I apply the Cure to the External Cauſe and not to the Patient, I have for a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident the Great <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> who cured a great Peſtilence by kindling great Fires, and thus correcting the Malignity of the Air. Beſide, there is nothing more ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary than to apply Sympathetick Powder to the Weapon that made the Wound. And this is my Opinion grounded on my Hypotheſis, and to which you ought to ſubmit, you being but a young Man, and I your Senior. That will I never do, ſaid the other, for my Hypotheſis, according to which I proceed in the Cure, is as good as yours, and large better. And ſo they ended without concluding any thing, though both great Mathematicians. Wherefore we ſee the Moon ſubject to theſe Fits to this Day. From all which you may underſtand how ſafe it is for Earthly Phyſicians to imitate theſe Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, or rather Lunatick ones: And in
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:62611:29"/>
ſuch an Art as Medicine is to follow the Method of the Aſtronomers.</p>
                     <p>Now the Doctor having demonſtrat the Excellency and Uſefulneſs of this Method, crys out, <hi>Et nos dubitamus,</hi> &amp;c. And do we doubt that Phyſick is not to be brought to perfection the ſame way? We muſt doubt till we have better Grounds to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. <q>Are not all Bodies (ſays he) of the ſame Nature, and may be changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one another,</q> &amp;c. as above. Well reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, all Bodies can be changed into one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, as Elephants into Oyſters, Sun Moon and Stars into Dunghils, Watches into Woodcocks. Here is a ſtrange Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphoſis. Would it not be pretty to hear one cry, Who will buy a Gooſe? and when you come to buy it, you find it a Pigg, at leaſt you may perſwade the Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler ſo, by this Reaſon, That every thing may be changed into another of what kind ſoever. But as univerſal as the Profeſſor thinks this Tranſmutation to be, yet there are ſome things altogether incapable of this Change: As for Example, theſe that are crack't from their Cradle can never be
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:62611:29"/>
made ſound; for their Diſeaſe is <hi>vitium orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni &amp; a privatione ad habitum non datur regreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi> I confeſs they may be Cured by a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, as the Man was that was born blind: But theſe that believe no Miracles have no reaſon to expect that one will be wrought in their Favours.</p>
                     <p>But that you may not take this for a piece of Counter-banter, I'll ſhow you that this Reaſoning is every whit as ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous and abſurd as I repreſent it. For though all Bodies may be ſaid to be of the ſame Nature, in reſpect of their common Eſſence and Properties as Extenſion, Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility, Mobility, &amp;c. yet it will not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that they ever can be changed into one another, or come under the ſame Laws; except the Doctor mean, that for ought we know the thing implies no Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, from which nothing at all can be concluded. The Laws of Nature are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed by the Author of Nature: But how far their Limits extend we know not. Yet we have reaſon to believe that He has ſet them their Bounds that they cannot paſs: For we find that every thing propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:62611:30"/>
after its kind, and ſome Tranſmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations are very hard: For we can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make a good Fire of Ice, though a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Author affirms, That in <hi>Iſland</hi> it is become ſo dry with Age, that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants make very good Fewel of it. But granting all this, how will it follow that the Laws and Affections of the Fluids and Canals in the Body of Man may be defined? Very well; for all Bodies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſame Nature, and ſubject to the ſame common Laws of Motion, the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtial as well as the Celeſtial, theſe we ſee not, as well as theſe we ſee. And the Aſtronomers, by a Method familiar to themſelves, and uſeful to all, having found out and defined the Laws and Affections of the latter, whoſe Motions and Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is obvious to our Eyes. Therefore the Phyſicians by the like Method may find out the Laws and Affections of the Fluids in the Body of Man, whoſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Figure or Motion, they cannot ſee, though inlightned with the Mathematicks, as we ſhall ſee when we come to examine the Profeſſor's Demonſtration of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:62611:30"/>
of the Pores. The Argument is juſt ſuch another as this, One that ſees well may be a good Painter: <hi>Erg:</hi> One that is ſtone blind may be ſo too. If the Profeſſor would be ſo kind as to aſſiſt us with Mathematical Spectacles to ſee the Animal Spirits, the Form, Figure and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture of their Parts, and all the ſmall Filaments and Pores by which all the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions are made, we would thank him for the Favour, and then think of follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe Star-gazers. But though he could make our Bodies as tranſparent as Cryſtal of the Rock, ſo that we could ſee with the naked Eye, all the order and harmony of the Microcoſm, as well as we do the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a Clock, we ſhould by this means have a more curious and uſeleſs Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but never a whit more uſeful or ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful Practice; Phyſick would ſtill be a Conjectural Art, and Phyſicians ſtill Gueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, and Men dye after the old faſhion, and Mathematicians be miſtaken, and Fools ſpeak Nonſenſe. If indeed the Profeſſor would teach us how to take down the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine and ſet it up again, to take out a
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:62611:31"/>
crack't Spring, and put in one that is ſound and whole; and when the Pendule runs too faſt to add ſome weight to the Ballance, and make the Vibrations more regular and equal and ſlow; then there would be ſome hopes of ſeeing ſome Mens Clocks go better, and ſtrike more regularly: Yet after all, I muſt confeſs, there would ſtill be ſome Watches that all the World would never make go right.</p>
                     <p>The Profeſſor has hitherto only ſhew'd us in general the Uſefulneſs and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of this New Method: But now he comes cloſs to the Point, and makes Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to a particular Caſe, to ſhow us the Power of his infallible Principles, and the heroick Exploits of his new knight Errants, the Mathematical Cauſes: Than which nothing can be more juſt; for all the Proof of the Pudding is in the eating. But if ever the Doctor make a good Pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with this Seaſoning, I'll eat the P—.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Becauſe (ſays he Parag. 25.) I ſaid that it was not neceſſary for Phyſicians to ſearch out Phyſical Cauſes, and that this may ſeem a hard Saying to the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers:
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:62611:31"/>
Therefore I'll illuſtrat and confirm the whole Matter, by an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample that none can except againſt.</q> This is the firſt time that ever I heard, that the knowledge of Phyſical or Natural Cauſes was altogether uſeleſs to a Phyſician. And therefore no wonder that not only Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, but all pretenders to common Senſe think this a ſaucy and ſenſeleſs Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Are not all evident Cauſes natural ones? But if the Doctor underſtands the firſt Principles of natural Bodies, the ſprings of their Actions, and the way and manner of their workings; I know none but ſome light nodled Mountebanks that follow this <hi>ignis fatuus,</hi> or falſe Light, or pretend to take any practical Indications thence, no more than from Mathematical Cauſes. For, as I told you before, neither <hi>Hippocrat</hi> nor <hi>Galen</hi> thought any ſuch knowledge neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. But that this is not the Doctor's Meaning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I will ſhew you by and by; for he himſelf alledgeth the knowledge of ſuch Cauſes, as the Phyſicians call Phyſical or Natural, very uſeful in the practice of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine. But let us hear him out.</p>

                        <q>The Phyſicians (ſays he) that wrote before us of the Diſeaſes of the Eyes, in which a kind of Images or Semblances appear before them, and trouble the Sight, confidently affirmed that the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Cauſe of this was, ſome litle Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcules or Motes ſweeming in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Humor of the Eye, which moving hither and thither up and down, imprint on the <hi>Retina,</hi> as it were the reſemblance of Flies, or ſuch like things, which we think we ſee before us.</q> And in this the Doctor alledgeth they wete very much miſtaken.</p>
                     <p>Here is a ſad and lamentable Story, that poor Mortals ſhould have been ſo long haunted with thoſe Spectres or Ghoſts (for ſo our Orator calls them) which are of a quite different Nature from all others of that kind, which for the moſt part haunt Men moſt in the Night; but thoſe are moſt troubleſome in the Morning, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally after a rouſing Cup.

For the Doctor had a learned Diſcourſe on this Subject, out of which this is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, in the Year 1685, about which time it was prophecied that the Labd would begin to Thrive. The Prophecy is this.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>

                        </q>
By which it appears that it was to thrive in Medicine, as well as other things. And this ſeems in ſome meaſure to illuſtrat the former Prophecy. Pray mark the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
                     <p>In this Diſcourſe the Doctor treats ſome eminent Phyſicians like School Boys, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling us, That they like Sheep followed
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:62611:33"/>

But ſince thoſe were the Sheep in Medicine, I wiſh the Doctor would tell us who were the Goats, that we might ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parat the one from the other. There is one Paſſage more in this Diſcourſe that ought to be taken notice of, and may be of great uſe to thoſe that love a Cup, <hi>viz.</hi> That theſe Ghoſts haunt Folks moſt in the Morning after drinking of Wine, but <hi>(N.

Whence I obſerve, that if we muſt needs take our Collation, that it be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the pure Blood of the Grape, than in muddy Ale: For if that make ſome Hob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goblings appear, this will make you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine you ſee whole Legions of Devils. A ſecond Obſervation is, That theſe evil Spirits are always raiſed with D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <q>I affirm (ſays the Doctor) that no Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles ſweeming in the aqueous Humor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

or contain'd within the Eye, can imprint their Image on the <hi>Retina.</hi>
                        </q> And I affirm the contrary, and ſo we are quits. But it muſt not go ſo: <q>For (ſays he) whoever conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders well how large the Diameters of the Eye muſt be, and what are the Laws of Refraction, will find, that the Image of any thing within the Eye, which is placed before the <hi>Retina,</hi> muſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected outwards, and can never make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny impreſſion on the <hi>Retina,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can no ways affect the Sight.</q> And I ſay, whoever conſiders the Laws of Senſe and Reaſon will ſind this Paſſage ſtark Nonſenſe. As for his Laws of Refraction, ſince he has not told us what they are, I am not concerned in them: For a Law not promulgat is as good as no Law at all. But the Doctor out of an exceſs of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty has diſpenſed with theſe Criminals be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tried by the Laws of the Dioptricks, and remitted them to the Judge Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Experience, who is very impartial. <q>But (ſays he, in the above-mentioned Diſcourſe 1685.) the thing is ſo clear, that without the help of the Opticks,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:62611:34"/>
it may be demonſtrate every Day by Experience: For if any thing be brought ſo near the Eye, that it almoſt touch the <hi>Cornea,</hi> the Eye will have no impreſſion of it, nor any perception at all.</q> Now though this be as falſe as <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> and equally contradicts the Teſtimony of our Senſes, yet many conſiderable Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages reſult from it. The <hi>Firſt</hi> is for thoſe who have tender and weak Eyes, who cannot endure the Light; for they may keep their Eyes almoſt quite ſhut conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (which will contribute very much to the Cure) and nevertheleſs ſee every whit as well as if they were wide open: For when any thing is brought ſo near the <hi>Cornea</hi> that it almoſt touch it, as the Eye lids no doubt do, it will make no impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon the Eye at all, nor any ways obſtruct the ſight. The <hi>Second</hi> is for thoſe who have a Cataract growing on the Eye, to convince them of a Miſtake they all labour under, which is, that they ſee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſomething like Midges or Flies that trouble the ſight; to convince, I ſay, theſe poor deluded Creatures, that it is only a
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:62611:34"/>
deception of the Senſe, and ſickneſs of their Brain, and conſequently that they muſt be treated as theſe who are Hypocondriack or Mad, without taking any notice of their Eyes at all. The <hi>Third</hi> and <hi>Laſt</hi> is univerſal and uſeful for all, which is, To make Men ſee through a Mil-ſtone, as well as the moſt tranſparent Cryſtal, by making the Object almoſt touch the <hi>Cornea:</hi> For then you will ſee every whit as well as if nothing were in your way at all. I hope no Man will doubt of theſe Concluſions, ſince you have the Profeſſor's word to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand them. <hi>Ipſe dixit.</hi>

                     <p>But all is not yet done, he has another String to his Bow; and I make no doubt with this two-fold Cord theſe poor Hob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goblings will be ſtrangled. For he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing that an Objection might be made, that although theſe litle Corpuſculs could not be ſaid properly to make any impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on the ſight; nevertheleſs they might produce the like effect, by hindring ſome Rays of Light that come from the Object to penetrat to the <hi>Retina,</hi> and ſo hide ſome parts of the Object from our ſight, has
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:62611:35"/>
armed himſelf with an <hi>Effatum,</hi> which he never wants upon occaſion. The <hi>Effatum</hi> is this, <hi>That there is no point of any viſible Object, from which there comes not Rays of Light to every point of the</hi> Cornea; <hi>ſo that although many points of the</hi> Cornea <hi>were co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with Spots, nevertheleſs all the parts of the Objects would be ſeen.</hi> This <hi>Effatum</hi> may truly be called <hi>Effartum,</hi> which comes from <hi>Fartum</hi> a Pudding: For never was Pudding more ſtuffed with Meat, than this is with Nonſenſe. Do not we ſee Objects by the Rays of Light that comes from them to the <hi>Retina,</hi> and if there come none from them at all, they cannot be ſeen (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Men have Cats Eyes, who, they ſay, ſee in the Dark) and by the ſame Reaſon if there come no Rays from any aſſignable part or point of the Object to it, there can be no perception of that part at all. Now if there be any Spots on the <hi>Cornea,</hi> or in the acqeous Humor, and if the Rays com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from any part of the Object fall on them, they can never penetrat into the bottom of the Eye, and ſo can make no ſenſation of theſe Parts there, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:62611:35"/>
muſt be hidden from our ſight. Do not all opack Bodies caſt a Shaddow? And are not theſe Spots ſuch? By what In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment then have they been wheedled out of their Birth-right? I have found where the knack lyes, which is here, That theſe litle Bodies are Witches or Wizards, which Children ſay have no Shaddow: And with this Reaſon I am content, till the Doctor find a better.</p>
                     <p>You ſee it was not without a Cauſe that the Doctor was angry with the Old Phyſicians, and that he had juſt ground to diſpoſeſs the phyſical Cauſes, and baniſh them from the Common-wealth of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine: But it was as juſt that ſome other ſhould be put in their room, who will prove a great deal better Subjects than they: And theſe are the Mathematical Cauſes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>But (ſays he) if that Point of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina,</hi> or Net in which the Rays that come from any viſible point of the Object, ſhould meet, be covered or compreſſed, ſo that the Image cannot reach it, there will be no ſenſation of the Object at all.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:62611:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And if the ſame thing fall out in many points of the <hi>Retina,</hi> all theſe things will come to paſs that the Phyſicians believed for ſo long a time was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted in the watry Humor.</q> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ſo ſtill for any thing the Doctor has ſaid to the contrary. But he goes on. <q>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Body knows that the <hi>Retina</hi> is a kind of Net, knit or woven of the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laments of the optick Nerves.</q> That's true good Doctor, but no Body knew it was a Net to catch Flies, till you told them. <q>This Flie-trap is invironed with the ſanguiferous Veſſels that creep along the bottom of the Eye, eſpecially in that part where the entry to the optick Nerve is. Therefore if the Eye be ſo placed, that the Rays muſt needs fall upon that point of the <hi>Retina,</hi> there will be no repreſentation of the Object. This will eaſily be found to be true, if two Objects be expoſed to our view in the ſame Line paralel to the Horizon, a litle higher than the Eye, and about a Foot and a half diſtant from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Then ſhuting the left Eye, and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:62611:36"/>
directing the right towards the Object on the left Hand, as the nature of the Eye requires: Firſt we ſhall ſee both Objects diſtinctly; then coming to ſuch a point, the Object on the right Hand will evaniſh, while in the mean time we ſee all round diſtinctly.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here one would almoſt ſwear, that the Profeſſor was playing at Croſs-purpoſes with this long winded Story of the Net in the bottom of the Eye, with which he deſigned to catch his Adverſaries the Old Phyſicians, as Spiders catch Flies; but theſe Foxes are too cunning for him, and in ſtead of catching them he has ſpread a Net for his own Feet. For the Doctor propoſes a queſtion that no Phyſician hitherto could Anſwer; and no wonder, ſince they were ignorant of this new Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, and never dreamed of Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Cauſes. The Queſtion is, What is the Cauſe, of a kind of litle Images of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Colours, but for the moſt part black that appear before ſome Folks Eyes like Flies or Midges? The Old Phyſicians Anſwer, that it is Motes that ſweem in the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:62611:37"/>
aqueous Humor of the Eye that makes this Impreſſion and Appearance. But the Profeſſor rejects this, and nauſeats it as muſty with Age: The Reaſon then, ſays he, of the appearing of theſe Images is, becauſe no Image at all appears. <q>For the Rays of Light (ſays he) falling on theſe Points of the <hi>Retina,</hi> where the the Filaments of the optick Nerves are covered with the ſanguiferous Veſſels, there will be no Image of the Object at all.</q> And to convince you the more of the truth of this, he illuſtrates the Matter wonderfully by a very appoſite Similitude, of two Objects placed as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bovementioned, whereof one diſappears at ſuch a diſtance. For the Queſtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, What is the Reaſon we come to ſee Objects we ſaw not before, which trouble our ſight? It is Anſwered by this Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, becauſe we looſe the ſight of theſe we ſaw before. Is not this well anſwered? Can any thing be more juſt, than he that looſes at one hand, ſhould gain at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Thus many hard Queſtions may be anſwered, that are both curious and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:62611:37"/>
uſeful: As wherefore hath a Horſe four Feet? Becauſe a Man hath two. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do you ſee the Steeple of <hi>Edinburgh?</hi> Becauſe you ſee not the Caſtle of <hi>Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bartoun.</hi> Why do you ſcratch your Head? Becauſe I do not ſcratch my Breech. But there is another part of the Queſtion that remains ſtill to be anſwered by this Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude, <hi>viz.</hi> What is the Reaſon, that where ever we go theſe Spectres haunt us, and we ſee them diſtinctly? It is An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, becauſe in the paralel Caſe an Object we ſaw before diſappears at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain diſtance, but ſtepping either forewards or backwards it preſently appears again.</p>
                     <p>Here is one of the moſt excellent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries that ever the World was bleſſed with, for curing Suffuſions, Pearls on the Eye, and Obſtructions of the optick Nerves that are not total: By which the Doctor may become more famous for Curing the Diſeaſes of the Eyes, than ever <hi>Sancta Lucia</hi> was. For that which was done formerly by the old dogged Method of Purging, Blooding, Cupping, Bliſtering, &amp;c. is now performed in the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:62611:38"/>
twinkling of an Eye; for advance, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, to the right hand about, or to the left, change the poſture of your Eye but a hair breadth, and by the virtue of <hi>Hocus pocus, preſto be gone,</hi> the work is done.</p>
                     <p>In the Concluſion the Doctor tells us, that though the Phyſicians hitherto have been ignorant of the phyſical Cauſes of theſe Diſeaſes; yet he thinks that he has explained their <hi>Mathematical</hi> or <hi>Medical</hi> Cauſes, <hi>the knowledge whereof is very uſeful and profitable for Phyſicians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Who can doubt of the truth of this, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Doctor has given ſo pregnant a Proof of this in the above-mentioned Caſe? Wherefore I exhort all Phyſicians who are ignorant of the Mathematicks, to betake themſelves ſeriouſly to that ſtudy whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their Age or Experience be (for it is never too late to learn) if ever they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to Cure Diſeaſes <hi>Cito, tuto &amp; jucunde,</hi> which they can never pretend to without the knowledge of their Mathematical Cauſes. <hi>Which was the thing to be demonſtrat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now the Doctor having done his work, cloſes all with an <hi>Utinam,</hi> as with a Grace
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:62611:38"/>
after Meat, (which was very well minded, for he forgot to ſay one before it) <q>I wiſh, ſays he, that I could as eaſily and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly explain all the Diſeaſes of the Body of Man and their Cures, I have done this.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And I wiſh I could as eaſily refute all Errors, as I have demonſtrat this Oration to be ſtark Nonſenſe, and down-right Gibberiſh. And thus I have done with the <hi>Inaugural Oration,</hi> which is the ground work of all.</p>
                     <p>I proceed next to examine the Doctor's <hi>Diſſertations</hi> or <hi>Diſcourſes,</hi> and to take a view of the ſtatly and magnificent Fabrick he has reared upon this Foundation. Here you ſhall have the Solution of many great and weighty Problems (not Triffles or matters of Moon-ſhine) in which Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind is as highly concerned, as to know whether <hi>Balaam</hi>'s Aſs had a ſhort Tail or a long, or in what Language ſhe reproved her Maſter. But ſuch as they are no Body hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto could ſolve them; becauſe, ſays the Doctor, they begged a great many things that were doubtful, obſcure and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:62611:39"/>
(which I think none but a Knave would ask, and none but a Fool grant) whereas by Principles plain and eaſie to be underſtood, the Matter may be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. This plain and eaſie Geometrical Method the Doctor follows all along in imitation of his great Maſter <hi>Archimedes,</hi> who beg'd but as much Ground as to ſet his Foot on, and he would remove the whole Earth, and toſs it like a Tennis-ball up and down the Air. This was but a poor Demand, yet poor as it was no Body would give him his asking, being affraid the Experiment might coſt them too dear; for though their perſons might be ſecure, no Body could be found that would enſure their Glaſſes and China Diſhes. But in this I think they were a little too peeviſh and nice. Had I been in thoſe Days and had had but one Foot of Ground bordering u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the terreſtial Glob, he ſhould have had it at a very eaſie Rate: And I ſhould have been as litle affraid of his performing his Undertaking, as I am of the Doctor's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming his, though I reſolve to grant him all his asking, although it were tentimes more.</p>

                           </gap>anguinis per vafaminima.</hi> In this the Doctor deſigns to be as good as his Word. For in his <hi>Oration,</hi> as I told you before, he ſays, He thinks he <q>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonſtrat, that there are no Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the Glandules of Man's Body, and that all the Pores and Orifices of the Veſſels have one and the ſame kind of Figure.</q> We ſhall ſee by and by whether or no his Thought has beguiled him for once.</p>
                     <p>The principal Deſign and Scope of this Diſcourſe, is to explain how Secretion is tranſacted in the Body of Man. You know that a great many Fluids are ſeparat from the Maſs of the Blood, as the Liquor of the Nerves, the Lymph, the Bile, the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, &amp;c. Now here the Doctors differ, ſome maintaining the Doctrine of Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, others who pretend to a more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile and refined Philoſophy, imbrace the mecanick Hypotheſis, which explains all Secretion by the different Figures of the Pores and Particles of the Fluids: Some join both together. The Doctor under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:62611:40"/>
takes to demonſtrat the Abſurdity of theſe, and to prove that all the Pores are alike in Figure, and differ only in ſize, and by this Hypotheſis pretends to explain Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Here the Doctor has to do with Men of his own mettal <hi>Des Cartes</hi> and his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, Mathematicians all over; and no doubt there will be a ſound blow: For no War is ſo cruel as that amongſt Brethren. Who can withold crying to ſee

                     <p>The Mechaniſts to illuſtrate their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, adduce the Example of a Sieve, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving holes of different Figures, as Triangu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, Circular, Square, &amp;c. through which they alledge that Bodies of the ſame Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure and Size will paſs, while others of a different Figure cannot though no bigger than the former.</p>
                     <p>The Doctor on the contrary alledgeth that the ſimilitude is altogether imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:62611:40"/>
becauſe it is not (according to him) difference of figure, but of bulk that makes one thing paſs and another not. Therefore ſayes he <hi>Sect.</hi> 9. <q>All bodies that paſs throw a ſieve, muſt be leſs, whatever, their figure be, then thoſe that do not, paſs: that is (as he explains himſelf) they muſt have leſs Diameters. For if all the Diameters of thoſe that paſs not, be no greater then the Diameters of thoſe that do paſs, then of neceſſity they muſt paſs mixed together. From whence it follows that diverſity of figure in the pores and particles of fluids, is not ſufficient except we ſuppoſe likewiſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of bulk which alone without this ſuperfluous diverſity of figure will do the job.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>To which the Mechaniſts anſwer that nothing is more abſurd than to aſſert that it is only difference of bulk and not of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure by which ſecretion can be explain'd, and that things of the ſame bigneſs though of different ſhapes will neceſſarly paſs mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together. For every body knows that two skrew nails every way alike in bulk, the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:62611:41"/>
Diameters of the one no manner of way bigger then the other, only becauſe of ſome ſmall difference in the figure. <hi>Viz,</hi> when the ſpiral line of the one runs croſs or contrary to that of the other. I ſay every body knows, that the one of thoſe will enter where the other cannot. Yea which is more ſome bodies can be aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned whoſe bulk and Diameters are every way leſs, then that of others, and yet theſe leſs will not paſs where the greater do, (but I have told the Doctor too much at once for any thanks I am like to have for it) which downright deſtroys the Doctors opinion, who it ſeems has not conſulted his Analyticks well in this, to ſuffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be skrewd out of it, by a poor vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nail. That which beguiled the Profeſſor is (and he ows me thanks for the diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) that the thing holds in ſome figures, though not in all: But it is dangerous from a few particulars to infer an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal concluſion. What can be more unjuſt then to alledge that all men are Rogues, Cheats, or Fools, becauſe ſome are ſuch? Or to judge all Phyſicians Atheiſts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:62611:41"/>
ſome Miſcreants of that Profeſſion has been ſuch fools, as to value themſelves for that very thing (thinking nothing could prove them men but denying God) I ſay Fools or Mad-men; becauſe it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Fool</hi> that <hi>hath ſaid in his heart</hi> that <hi>there is not a God,</hi> and none but a madman will expreſs it with his mouth: which is a demonſtration to me that all Atheiſts are ſuch.</p>
                     <p>What a ſhame is it for a Profeſſor who teaches others, to make ſuch a wrong ſtep, as to conclude that becauſe difference of bulk is ſometimes the cauſe of ſuch a thing, therefore it is alwayes ſo?</p>

He ſhould have conſidered that it is in the oeconomy of the little world, as it is in that of the great, For as in this, there are ſome men civil and courteous: others rude and unmannerly, ſurly and dogged, ſnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and curriſh; ſo in that, there are ſome pores and particles whoſe figure is ſmooth equal and plain: and others whoſe ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces are rough and unequal: theſe may

be called ſurly curriſh or ſnarling pores, thoſe civil and well behaved ones. Now ſuppoſe a pore to be ſmooth, and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But if a croſs-grain'd cilynder, ſuch as my skrew nail, comes to a pore whoſe ſpiral line runs croſs to its, it may well knock at the door, but not enter: then they muſt needs fall a ſcolding.

                     <p>But this is not all the Doctor has to ſay, for granting all the orifices of the veſſells had ſuch determinat figures as Triangles, Squares, Paralelograms &amp;c. fitted for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Cones, Cubes and Priſms, and all other kindes of particles, that are to be ſeparat from the maſs of the blood in the glandules, granting this (as he alledgeth) no ſecretion will follow upon it. For that this way may be effectuat, it is neceſſary not only that thoſe particles be equal to, and of a like figure with the orifices, but that they be ſcituat the ſame way, when they come to enter. As for example, that a cubick particle of ſalt, or any other thing, may enter into a ſquare Pore, it is not only neceſſary that the one be equal to the other, but that it be ſcituat the ſame way, <hi>i. e.</hi> that the Angles and Sides of the cube anſwer exactly to thoſe of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifice; for this is the only way it can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The ſame holds in cones &amp;c. But there are infinit other ways theſe particles
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:62611:43"/>
may be ſcituat at their approaching the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifices, which will hinder their entry. From all which the Doctor concludes, that no ſecretion can be made this way, becauſe there is but one cauſe can<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>be aſſigned for it, and infinit cauſes that may hinder it. And this is the pith and Marrow of the Doctors objection, though not in the ſame words as it is propoſed by him.</p>
                     <p>Now here is a great deal ado, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to no more but <hi>a may be,</hi> and, as we uſe to ſay, what may be may not be. The Doctor cannot deny that the thing is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, which is enough to blunt the edge of his pretended demonſtration: for what is demonſtrat is ſo certain that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is impoſſible. Nothing can be more ridiculous than to reaſon thus. For though there be but one way ſuch a thing can be done, and ten thouſand wayes to hinder it: yet if the thing be determined to act that one way, the ten thouſand poſſible impediments amount juſt to nothing at all. If the Doctor be ſo generous as to grant his Adverſaries that the particles have cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain determinat figures, why will he deny
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:62611:43"/>
them certain determinat motions and ſcitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations? And when he aſſigns me a cauſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> why ſuch a Pore or particle is Triangu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, Square, &amp;c. then I'le tell him what determines the ſcituation of theſe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſolids ſuch a particular way, when they approach the Orifices of the ſecretory veſſels. There is but one way I know of for a Rop-dancer to keep himſelf from falling, and that is by ballancing his body and keeping it in an equilibre, and a great many wayes he may fall, and yet for the moſt part he does not fall: when a Cat is thrown from a height, for the moſt part ſhe falls on her feet, though there are many other wayes, ſhe may fall. Now let us ſuppoſe theſe Cubes, Cones, &amp;c. to be as dextrous at entring the Pores<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the Rope-dancer is to ballance himſelf, or the Cat to fall on her feet, and the work is done. I may ſuppoſe alſo that theſe litle bodies are of a ſtiff and ſtubborn, ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceited nature (as for the moſt part litle folks are) and will enter no way but one, juſt as the loadſtone will draw nothing but iron, though you ſhould preſent a
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:62611:44"/>
thouſand other things, and the needle touch'd by it will turn but one way, tho there be almoſt infinit otherwayes it may turn. You ſee Sir the Doctor has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrat Mathematically, that ſecretion cannot be performed this way, which ſince it is daily done in the body of man, it muſt certainly be performed ſome other way. And here we come to the pretended demonſtration of the uniformity of figure in all the Pores, which the Doctor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes to be round: and by this plain ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie way he pretends to explain ſecretion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>A circle ſayes he, <hi>Sect.</hi> 14. is the largeſt, and moſt capacious of all fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures that have the ſame Diameter with it ſelf, and will admit the plains of all fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures whatever way they be ſcituat, providing their Diameters be no greater then its own: Therefore ſince it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitly more probable, that bodies com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to any Orifice that is not circular, will not anſwer exactly to it, it is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly probable alſo that by forcing their entry, they will change the figure of the Orifice into ſuch as will give free paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:62611:44"/>
to bodies of any figure, or ſcituat any way, <hi>i. e.</hi> they will make it cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Which will yet more certainly come to paſs, if that which runs into the Orifice be liquid: for in that caſe, though the Orifice were not circular, nevertheleſs, ſeing the parts neareſt the centre<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                           <hi>i, e.</hi> the Sides, are more preſſed and thruſt outwards by the liquor, than the parts that are farther from the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Angles, and ſince the Sides of the Orifice are flexible and eaſily yeeld, it follows that all the parts of the Orifice will neceſſarly be thruſt out to the ſame diſtance from the centre,</q>

                        <q>It's highly probable ſayes he that the Pores, though they were not circular will at laſt become ſuch, by the litle corpuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of different figures, ſtriving to enter and foreing their way.</q> To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer that there is not the leaſt ſhadow of probability for it, yea it is altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, and quite contrary to the Laws of Nature, and the oeconomie of the litle world. For ſuppoſe a cube ſtriving to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſquare Orifice, ſhould apply its cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to the ſides of the ſquare, providing they be equally hard, they may well play at hard heads a while together; but in my humble opinion the cube would come of with the loſs of his bolſpreet, and if he continue to play tricks ſtill, may not only chance to level his noſe with his cheeks, but alſo to ſmooth all his angles, and make himſelf round in ſtead of the Pore, and by this means take a Tartar: for every School Boy knows that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle of any thing is ſooner broke of than the ſide.</p>

But the Doctor may urge, that if one ſingle Cub were engaged with a ſingle Pore, it would fall out as I ſuppoſe: but he is back'd with a great Troop of confederat Cubs, Cilynders and Priſms, which like a Torrent come on rap rap on the Orifice, and at laſt by forcing their way, reduce the irregular Orifice to order, by making him ſmooth and round. Now tho' I ſhould grant that they might thus force their way, yet it will not follow that even they can make the Pore circular (for it is capable of almoſt an infinite number of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Figures) except they be ſuppoſed to combine together, and fight under the Banner of the <hi>Archaeus.</hi> But though this were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:62611:46"/>
and his Admirers to be a Mathematical Demonſtration, but (as he ſays himſelf) is approven for ſuch, by two of the moſt famous Mathematicians in <hi>Europe.</hi> From which I obſerve, that moſt famous Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians may fall into foul Miſtakes; and that implicite Faith is as neceſſary in the School of <hi>Archimedes,</hi> as in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> For to believe a Dream to be a Demonſtration in contradiction to our Reaſon, and Bread to be Fleſh, contrary to our Senſes, is equally abſurd.</p>
                     <p>But that I may not ſeem to deal a litle too ſeverely with the Doctor (for <hi>ſummum jus, ſumma injuria)</hi> in refuſing Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Evidence, and caſting Mathematical Certainty, I'll grant him for once, that all the Pores of the Body, and Orifices of the Veſſels are round of neceſſity, and by the very Laws of Nature, and that this Dream is as good a Demonſtration as any in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clid.</hi> Let us ſee then how Secretion will be performed this way.</p>
                     <p>The only Secretion that I think will follow, is a kind of Secretion, which may be called no Secretion at all, or more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly

If the <hi>Second,</hi> then the Urine would go in greater quantity into the <hi>Receptacle</hi> of the Bile, than into the Reins, and thence into the Inteſtins; which I think would be very convenient, and ſave the Expence of many a Clyſter: For Fowles who have their Ureters inſerted in the <hi>inteſtinum rectum,</hi> let both fly together. If the <hi>Third,</hi> why then ſhould they go into different Receptacles, and not paſs equally both ways? except we ſuppoſe that <hi>Dolaeus</hi> Bogles ſtand Sentinels at the Orifices, and ſuffer none to enter but theſe that have the <hi>Archaeus</hi> Paſs, to go into ſuch or ſuch a quarter. The Matter, as I conceive, may be clearly explained thus, according to the Doctor's, Hypotheſis, which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth all the Pores round, and only dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent in ſize.</p>

The Body of Man, you know, is called the <hi>Microcoſm</hi> or litle World; in which there muſt be a Government, as well as in the great World. One of the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Laws of all Government is <hi>Property,</hi> without which all muſt run into Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Diſorder. There muſt be likewiſe ſome Supream to ſee the Laws put in execution, and every Man's Right main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. Now in the <hi>Oeconomie</hi> of Man's Body every ones Right is ſetled by Law. The Blood, the Bile, the Animal Spirits, the Urine, &amp;c. have all their own Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories aſſigned them: The Head for one, the Veins and Arteries for another, the Reins for a third, and ſo on. While theſe live peaceably together under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Archaeus,</hi> all is well, the Body is in good Health: For as the thicker cannot paſs where the thinner may, ſo the thinner dare not paſs where the thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket does, without being puniſhed by Law. Now if notwithſtanding all this, they come to invade one anothers Properties, and the Blood go by the way of the Urine, and the Chyle by Stool, and the Bile by Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,

then an Inteſtine War is raiſed in the <hi>Microcoſm;</hi> which if the <hi>Archaeus</hi> can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſce, all is in peace again: And if not, the <hi>Oeconomie</hi> muſt go to ruine, and reſolve into the ſtate of Nature: where, they ſay, all things are all Mens, <hi>i. e.</hi> Nothing is is any Mans. And this is the only way that Secretion by Pores of the ſame figure only differing in bigneſs, can be explained without Confuſion: And ſo once more I have helped the Profeſſor out of the Mire.</p>
                     <p>The Doctor now having got the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry (not without my Help) claps his Wings and crows, extols his Geometrical Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to the Skies, telling us <hi>Sect.</hi> 17. That<q>he cannot but rejoice in behalf of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine and this happy Age, in which Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry is brought to ſuch perfection by many skilful Artiſts, eſpecially by <hi>Iſaac Newton,</hi> that there is ground to hope, that by the help of Principles which that great Man has found out, the Virtues and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of Medicaments, which are for the Comfort and Succour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Mankind, will be more certainly diſcovered.</q>

Now as the Doctor cannot but rejoice, ſo I cannot but be ſorry and pity ſome Men in this Age, who are given up to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Lies, and publiſh to the World Dreams for Demonſtrations. And if this were all, it were no great matter; for it is but natural for Men to be fond of their own Imaginations, though never ſo ugly: But to ſee ſome who pretend to common Senſe, and an ordinary ſtock of Learning, fall down before thoſe Idols, or Nothings (for an Idol is nothing) and worſhip not the Works of their own Hands, but the Spawn and deformed Brood of other Mens Brains, is ſuch a piece of Abſurdity that can hardly be matched, and ſuch a degree of Madneſs that nothing can excuſe but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible Ignorance, or <hi>vitium organi.</hi> What this great Man may do by his Principles for the advancement of Medicine, I know not: But if what the Doctor has given us he a foretaſte of the Fruits we are to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, we have reaſon to look for nothing but ſower Grapes that will ſet our Teeth on edge, and give <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Theſe are but <hi>Rodomontado</hi> Expreſſions that ariſe from ill digeſted Thoughts, as Belching does from the Crudity of a weak Stomack. Men may brag what they pleaſe, and tell us of their Dreams and Viſions, and their new Methods of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting Medicine: But I maintain there is no other Method but that of the Ancients, eſpecially of <hi>Hippocrat,</hi> by which we can advance that Art, and no wonder ſince it is the Method of Nature. And for finding out the Virtues and Qualities of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, we muſt learn that from the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter of Fools, and his two Uſhers <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie</hi> and our <hi>Senſes:</hi> For the Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks can no more aſſiſt us here, than the Lunaticks. But this may ſeem a litle too bold, ſince the Profeſſor has explained clearly by theſe Principles the Virtues of <hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>Opium,</hi> which leads me by the Hand to his Diſcourſe <hi>De cauſis di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſae molis qua fluit ſanguis per palmonem natis &amp; non natis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This learned Man in the beginning of this more learned Diſcourſe, tells us that we ſhould not undertake the ſolution of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:62611:49"/>
a Problem by a great many Poſtulats, which may be done by a few: That is to ſay, we need not <hi>Hercules</hi>'s Club to break an Egg when we may do it with the tip of our Finger. And therefore ſays he, <q>I am not pleaſed with thoſe that explain the Operation of <hi>Mercury</hi> by a kind of Salt, like to that which is extracted from the Aſhes of Plants, by the means of which it units it ſelf with the acid Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, and purgeth them out of the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels.</q> The Doctor is not pleaſed with thoſe, and I am not pleaſed with him, while he pretends to explain the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Mercury</hi> by its Gravity; becauſe I find nothing in his Reaſons but grave Nonſenſe, which I will weigh in a juſt Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance. That Mercury is very heavy, no Body can deny; and yet the lighteſt No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles are full of it, which ſeems a Paradox. That it works by its Weight or Gravity, is falſe and abſurd, which the Doctor proves himſelf to ſave me the trouble. <q>For Gold, ſays he, reduced into a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, or any form fit to mix with the Maſs of the Blood, will have virtue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portional
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:62611:50"/>
to its weight, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will exceed all other Medicines as far in virtue,</q> as it ſurpaſſes them in weight. Here you have a Chain of excellent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries, the firſt link whereof is Gold, the ſecond Mercury, the third Silver, the fourth Lead, and ſo on according to their weight. Now according to this Doctrine, Gold being moſt heavy will prove much more effectual in the Cure of the <hi>French</hi> Pox, and ſome other Diſeaſes, by Salivation than Mercury, which the meaneſt Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon-baber knows to be falſe. Let Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebanks talk what they pleaſe of their <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum potabile,</hi> I maintain that Gold is a much better Drug in the Pocket, than in the Stomack, and that <hi>Aurum potandum</hi> is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry far preferable to <hi>Aurum potabile.</hi> By the ſame Rule of Proportion it likewiſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that Silver and Lead, being next to Mercury in weight, muſt alſo be next in Virtue, and may come up to it by increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Doſe, as we do in other Medicines. Thus may you have a cheap domeſtick Drug that may ſerve for the Cure of all theſe Diſeaſes Mercury is good for. But
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:62611:50"/>
ſince Ball without Powder is but dull and unactive, I think it will not be amiſs to Charge the Piece with <hi>Jeſuits-Powder,</hi> and then you can ſcarce miſs the Mark. One would think here was proof enough of the wonderful effects of Gravity: But this is not all, it is a fertile Principle, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth many ſtrange things. For the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor tells us in another of his Diſcourſes, <q>That Baths, whatever their nature be, have the ſame Virtue, providing they be made of Liquors equally heavy:</q> 
                        <hi>Nam,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>operantur vi ſolius gravitatis.</hi> This Diſcovery is altogether New, which both the Ancients and Moderns were ignorant of. For though <hi>Bellinus</hi> attributes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the weight of the Liquor; yet he never dreamed that they work <hi>vi ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius gravitatis:</hi> For he proves that the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor of the Bath enters into the Maſs of the Blood with the Virtues of theſe things it is impregnat with. This Invention is worth Gold, at leaſt it will ſave a great deal of Money that was expended on Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys to the Baths in <hi>England, France,</hi> &amp;c. For if you know but the Secret to make
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:62611:51"/>
any Liquor to have the ſame weight with thoſe, it will have the ſame virtue, and if you doubt of the truth of it, you have the Profeſſor's word for it. But the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement may be carried on further. For the ſame holds in Lotions, Fomentations and Embrocations, Ointments and Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, that muſt needs work all the ſame way. Here is an excellent Diſcovery for finding out <hi>Succedaneums</hi> or <hi>Quid pro Quo.</hi> For if you want any Ointment or Plaiſter of ſuch or ſuch a virtue, if you can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the proportion between the bulk and weight, you may preſently have one like it. By this means you may make an Ointment that will have the Virtues of the Balm of <hi>Gilead</hi> or <hi>Peru</hi> externally, the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis of which may be a T—d; which will be an excellent Improvement of this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick Commodity. As for Bathing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver concern your ſelf what the Liquor is, whether Milk, Wine or Brandy, or Cows Piſs, if you pleaſe: And its no matter what it be impregnant with, Hemlock or Henbane, Camomile or Mallows, the ſteams of a pocky Rogue, or Musk or
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:62611:51"/>
Ambergriſe: For if the one weigh no more than the other, you are as ſecure as the Profeſſor's Word can make you. <hi>Nam operantur vi ſolius gravitatis.</hi> And thus you have a new Improvement of the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicina ſtatica</hi> that <hi>Sanctorius</hi> never dreamed of. But before I leave this, there is one Advice that I would give concerning In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Baths, whether Cold or Hot, which are more frequent and ordinary in this Countrey than External ones, and it is this: That ye do not truſt this Doctrine, but reject it as heretical; for though in theſe the Liquors work only by their Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, in thoſe they work only by their Levity: For the lighter the Liquor the more intoxicating it is; for as far as Brandy exceeds Claret in lightneſs, ſo far it ſurpaſſes it in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Virtue of Fudling. But this by the by.</p>
                     <p>It's now high time to conſider the main End and Deſign of this Diſcourſe. You may be ſure it is no Triffle; <hi>Aquila non captat muſcas.</hi> The Deſign then is, to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer a hard and difficult Queſtion, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the Learned by <hi>Harvey,</hi> which
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:62611:52"/>
is, How the <hi>Embryo</hi> or <hi>Foetus</hi> lives in the Womb after the 7 Month, without breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Air by the Wind-pipe, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs if it be born in the ſeventh Month, it preſently breaths in air; yea without breathing it can ſcarce live one Moment: But though it continue longer than the ninth Month, it enjoys both Life and Health. <hi>Sect.</hi> 14.</p>
                     <p>Here is that knotty Queſtion that has pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zell'd ſo many, a great deal harder than any ever <hi>Sphynx</hi> propoſed to the Inhabitants of <hi>Thebes,</hi> and (which is ſad) which no Body hitherto could Anſwer, till the Profeſſor, like another <hi>OEdipus</hi> appear'd, or rather like a ſecond <hi>Alexander,</hi> and cut aſunder the Knot he could not unty. Let us hear this Miſtery opened up.</p>
                     <p>I will not waſte Paper in tranſlating the Doctor's tedious, perplexed and confuſed way he anſwers the Queſtion, but will give you the ſubſtance of it in as few words as I can. Since Life is maintain'd by the circulation of the Blood, it is neceſſary as well before the Child be born as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. But while it is in the Womb, the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:62611:52"/>
Lungs being clapt together, the Veſſels neceſſarly muſt be compreſs'd, and ſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or no Blood can circulat that way: Wherefore it circulats from the great Vein into the great Artery, by two other ways Nature hath provided, the one a Canal, the other an Anaſtomoſis: And ſo the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants Life is preſerved in the Womb with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out breathing. But ſo ſoon as it is born, and has once breathed in air, by which the Lungs are blown up, the Veſſels are no more preſſed, and ſo the Blood finds an eaſier paſſage through the Lungs, than by the ways above-mentioned, which therefore at laſt come to be ſtopt, and dried up, becauſe the Blood runs no more in that Channel. Now when theſe ways are ſtopt, and no other way left for the Blood to circulat but by the Lungs, if that be ſtopt too, the Animal muſt needs dye, becauſe the Blood cannot circulat; and this Paſſage is ſtopt when the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal does not breath.</p>
                     <p>After the writing of this, the Doctor finding his Demonſtration lame (which I cannot ſay it is, for it has never a Legg
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:62611:53"/>
to ſtand on, and lameneſs is a defect of the Leggs) he tells us in the 14 <hi>Sect.</hi> of his next learned Diſcourſe, That there remains one Phaenomen concerning Reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to be further explained, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he did not make plain enough in its proper place, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                        <q>That while the old Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals are open in a Puppie; yet if it has once breathed in air, upon the ſtoping of the Wind-pipe it quickly dyes, though not altogether ſo ſoon,</q> as one that is old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. I confeſs if the Profeſſor anſwer this, he bids fair to gain the Point: For here the difficulty lyes, according to his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the neceſſity of Breathing. But I know he can no more do it, than he can tell me how many Hairs was in <hi>Aeſcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius</hi>'s Beard, or <hi>Pegaſus</hi>'s Tail; which if he do, I am content he make a Rope of them to hang all his Adverſaries, where I may be ſure to have a kick among the reſt. But let us hear him out, and not ſtop his Breath, while he is diſcourſing of Breathing. <q>For, ſays he, if the Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipe be ſtopt after Inſpiration, a part of the air which remains in the Lungs, is
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:62611:53"/>
rarified and expanded that the Blood cannot paſs through them, the Veſſels being preſſed by the elaſtick force of the Air; and the Blood cannot all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culat by the other Canals, though they be ſtill open, nor did it ever paſs all that way; and therefore the Creature dies, the Blood being coagulat in the right Ventricle of the Heart.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This reaſoning of the Doctor's is juſt like the ſtrugling of a blind Mare in a quag-mire, the further in the deeper: So every new Explanation he brings is a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther degree of Confuſion. The Beaſt in the quag-mire may be excuſed becauſe ſhe is blind: But I know not what can be ſaid for the Profeſſor who has Eyes and ſees not, though aſſiſted with a pair of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical Spectacles. I wonder how any Man who has a grain weight of Mother wit, can think to make ſuch Braſs Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, or rather Fairy-money (which bears the Image and Superſcription of Nonſenſe) paſs in the World for good Coin. Here is indeed a Demonſtration, that carries not ſo much as a ſhaddow of probability
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:62611:54"/>
along with it. What Countrey Clown would not laugh at ſuch a Reaſon as the Profeſſor gives for the Puppies Death, which is, That the paſſage by the Lungs being ſtopt, though the old Canals be open yet the Blood will not go all that way, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it never went all that way before. This is indeed a Witticiſm that ſurpaſſeth all thoſe of <hi>Teague-land</hi> that ever I heard, of which the knack lies here, That either ſome part of the Blood knows not the way, having never trod that path before; or if it had, being but very young, it has quite forgot the way, for five or ſix Minuts may be as much to it, as ſo many Years to one well grown; and ſo when the poor infant Blood groaps in the dark for the way, and cannot find it, it coagulats in the right Ventricle of the Heart, and ſo the poor Puppie dies, becauſe the Circulation is ſtopt.</p>
                     <p>But, laying Jeſting aſide, I'll tell you in good Earneſt where I think the pith of the Argument lies, if it have any at all, <hi>viz.</hi> That the paſſage by the Lungs being now entirely ſtopt, which it was never before,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:62611:54"/>
there is not room enough by the other two for all the Maſs of the Blood to paſs. To which I ſay, Let it e'en ſtep on ſlowly and take the more time, and it will come to its Journeys end before Night: For though the circular Motion of the Blood be neceſſary for Life; yet it needs not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways run as if it were chaſed. There are ſcarce two in the World in whom it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, and Men live both in Winter and Summer, in hot and cold Climats; and ſo will the Puppie in ſpite of this Medico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mathematical Demonſtration, and find to its comfort the truth of the old Proverb, That it is better to be condemned by ten Phyſicians than one Judge. And thus I have prevented the ſhedding of innocent Blood, or rather the ſtoping of it.</p>
                     <p>But it is pity Men ſhould live in Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and therefore I'll bring a Child to inſtruct the Profeſſor, which I hope he will not take ill: For as a Fool may give a wiſe Man good Counſel ſometimes, ſo may an innocent Child, in whom the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Nature are not debauch'd with too much Learning which makes Men
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:62611:55"/>
mad, give a Leſſon to a Profeſſor of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine. Let us hear then how the Child will anſwer a paralel Caſe. There is a Conduit for conveying Water to the Houſe divided into three Branches, one whereof goes to the Kitchin, another to the Stables, and a third to the Brew-houſe. Now Child, if one ſhould ſtop rhe Branch that goes to the Stables, what will become of the Water that went thither? No doubt, ſays the Child, we ſhall have it at the Brew-houſe and Kitchin. No Child, that cannot be, for the Water never went all that way before. What then, ſays the Child, what ſhould hinder it to go now, ſince there are two patent ways by which it may go? I have told you already, Child, becauſe it never went all that way before. What will then become of it, Sir, ſay you? It will ſtop, Child, and the Water of the two other Branches will ſtop alſo, to bear it company in good manners, and ſo the Water will ſtagnat at the Fountain, and you ſhall dye for want of Water, and this is demonſtrat by a learned Phyſician, who is likewiſe a great Mathematician. That
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:62611:55"/>
is none of my buſineſs, ſays the Child, as long as the other two Canals are open, we ſhall have Water in ſpight of his Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, and live maugre a Demonſtration.</p>
                     <p>From this Mathematical Demonſtration redounds a confiderable Advantage to the Lieges and Damage to the Tinkers: For theſe Rogues when they mend one Hole, ordinarly make two, but here by ſtoping one, you ſtop three. <hi>q. e. d.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In this place the Doctor takes occaſion to inquire into the force of Thunder that ſtops the Breath all of a ſudden, and choaks Men in the very twinkling of an Eye. Here you ſhall ſee that the Doctor is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>Myſta Naturae,</hi> penetrats into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Receſſes of Nature.</p>
                     <p>The Reaſon the Doctor gives for ſuden Death occaſioned thus, is, <q>The ſuden and great Expanſion of the Air, whoſe Particles, ſays he, become both lighter and larger, and ſo cannot enter into the Lungs:</q> And ſo the Blood cannot cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culat becauſe the Lungs will clap together and compreſs the Veſſels: And therefore the Creature who is thunder-ſtruck muſt
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:62611:56"/>
preſently dye, the Circulation being ſtopt. The Doctor told you juſt now, That the Puppie dies, becauſe when once it has breath'd in air, ſome Particles which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſtill in the Lungs are ſo rarified and expanded, that they blow up the Lungs to ſuch a degree, that the Veſſels are preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed together, and the Circulation ſtopt: And here you are told that the Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſtopt meerly becauſe there is no air in the Lungs at all; which is indeed very odd that it ſhould fall out juſt at the very nick of time that one is killed with Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Whereas I think it would fall out quite otherwiſe; for the Particles of the Air that are in the Lungs would be affraid to come out for the Thunder. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor ſays, he was the more confirmed in this Opinion, by ſeing one opened who <q>was killed with Thunder at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where nothing was to be obſerved that might occaſion his Death, except this wonderful ſhrinking and clapping toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Lungs.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here is a wonderful Explication of the wonderful Effects of Thunder, and of its
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:62611:56"/>
way of working. And here I cannot but wonder that this Mathematical Archer, one of the true Sons of <hi>Apollo,</hi> ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver once hit the Mark with his geometrical Arrow; One hit for the Honour of the Nation, that we may not be aſhamed of our Glory. But let us examine this thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Gibberiſh.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>The Air, ſays he, being expanded or rarified,</q> it cannot enter into the Lungs, What then? Cannot we live a Minut or two without Air? No doubt and more. How comes it to paſs then, that thoſe who are thunder-ſtruk fall down dead in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, as one ſhot through the Head? But why ſhould the Air, being rarified, not enter into the Lungs? Becauſe, ſays the Doctor, the Particles become larger and lighter. Here is an excellent Diſh of Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe dreſſed <hi>a-la-mode.</hi> For any Body knows that in rarifying of Liquids the parts become not larger but leſs, for one is divided into a Thouſand or more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitly. If the Air were like to Braſs, or any other malleable Matter, what the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor alledgeth might follow. The Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:62611:57"/>
of the Air then by Rarifaction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more ſubtile and penetrating, and ruſh hither and thither on all quarters with the greater violence, according to the force of the Impellent; which will be ſo far from hindering it to enter into the Lungs, that it will rather run into them like a Torrent, and by blowing them up preſs the Veſſels, and ſo ſtop the Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: And conſequently if any dye by this Accident, it muſt not be for want of Air, but for having too much. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver one would think that in this Caſe the Air being rarified, would become like a large Cupping-glaſs, and occaſion not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſwelling of the Lungs, but of the whole Body, rather than their clapping together. The Example of the Lungs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clapt together in him the Doctor ſaw opened, is ſo Childiſh that I almoſt bluſh to repeat it. What! does not every Body know, that thoſe who die either a natural or violent Death, if their Wind-pipe be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, dye in the act of Exſpiration, and not Inſpiration? And therefore we ſay when any Body dies, That they breath'd
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:62611:57"/>
                        <hi>Out</hi> their laſt, and not that they breathed <hi>In</hi> their laſt; and ſo no wonder the Lungs be clapt together. Moreover if the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſion or Rarefaction of the Air be the cauſe of this Phaenomen, how comes it to paſs that many are ſcorched with Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Gun-powder who are killed by neither, ſince there is reaſon to believe the Air as much rarified in theſe as in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-mentioned Caſe? If this Doctrine hold, it will make one afraid of a very F—t, for that expands the Air after its own faſhion, as is evident by the Crack.</p>
                     <p>Being now almoſt breathleſs in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Demonſtration about Breathing, it is high time to refreſh our ſelves a litle: Wherefore I will intertain you with the Doctor's Diſcourſe, <hi>De motu quo cibi in ventriculo rediguntur ad formam ſanguini re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiendo idoneam.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here I promiſe you a Diſh of as well dreſſed Chile as ever you taſted. Nothing could come in better ſeaſon after a Treat of Air, which though it be abſolutly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for our ſubſiſtence, yet it is but a lent Diet alone, there muſt be ſome more
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:62611:58"/>
ſolid ſubſtance, to make this Veſtal Flame, or lamp of Life burn: Even as in Fire, which without both goes out. This ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Subſtance I confeſs is eaſily found; but all the matter is to know how it is digeſted and turned unto Nouriſhment; which is as neceſſarly for a Phyſician to know, as it is for a Cook to underſtand how the Fire aſſimulats its Fewel, and whether or no the igneous Atoms that inſinuat themſelves into the Pores of the Meat while it is a boiling or frying, be nothing but raments of the third Element ſweeming in the firſt, as Fiſh in Water, before he can make you a good Potage, or Fricaſie of Chickens.</p>
                     <p>The Doctor in order to the eſtabliſhing of his own Opinion, firſt refutes his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries. And here he is like to have a hard pull for it (for the greater the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, the more glorious the Victory) for he has a number of Surly, Sour-look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Saucy Fellows to encounter, armed with ſour and ſalt Ferments, and <hi>Stygian</hi> Liquors, and <hi>Vanhelmonts Archaeus,</hi> and <hi>Dolaeus</hi> Bogles to grample with: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:62611:58"/>
he had need of Armour that is proof: For theſe Ferments cut like <hi>aqua fortis:</hi> But the <hi>Archaeus</hi> and <hi>Lemures</hi> are worſt of all, for nothing will do with them but Conjuration.</p>
                     <p>We come now to the Queſtion to be anſwered. <hi>viz.</hi> How the Meat is to be digeſted. <hi>i. e.</hi> What Power, or Faculty, or Ferment, diſſolves the Meat in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, and makes it fit for Nouriſhment?</p>
                     <p>Many different Opinions have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this, as well among the Ancients as Moderns. The Opinions of the Ancients were Four. Some followed <hi>Hippocrat,</hi> who affirmed Heat was the Cauſe of Conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Others maintained with <hi>Pliſtonicus,</hi> the Diſciple of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> that the Meat did putrifie or rot in the Stomack, and ſo that Concoction was Putrefaction, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently that the Stomack was a kind of Dung-hill. The Third was that of <hi>Era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtratus</hi> (and this is the Doctor's, which I believe he takes to be new, though it be more than 1600 Years old) who held, that Meat was bruiſed or grinded in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, and ſo the Stomack by conſequence
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:62611:59"/>
was a kind of Mill, and digeſting nothing but grinding. The Fourth maintained with <hi>Aſclepiades,</hi> that what we call Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction is no Concoction at all, but that the Meat raw and undigeſted as it is eaten, is diſtribute through the Body. This was the briskeſt Fellow of them all, who came in at the broad-ſide, and told them that they were debating about nothing, for there was no ſuch thing as Concoction. I wonder the Doctor was not of his ſide, ſince they ſeem to be of a party: For as this Man maintained that Concoction was no Concoction at all; ſo the Doctor gives us Demonſtrations which are no Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations at all.</p>
                     <p>Among the Moderns ſome followed the Ancients: Others, ſalt and ſour Ferments, ſome had recourſe to the <hi>Archaeus,</hi> &amp;c. The Doctor only begs one thing for to refute his Adverſaries Opinions, which is ſo juſt that no Body can refuſe it, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                        <q>That whatever the Cauſe of Concoction be, it muſt be ſuch that will not either diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the Stomack, or other ſolid Parts of the Body, as it were with a chymical
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:62611:59"/>
Fire,</q> or <hi>aqua fortis.</hi> This is altogether as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable as to demand, that the Pot that boils our Broath be ſuch as the Fire will not melt down while the Broath is a boiling. This being granted, the Doctor ſoon ſtops his Adverſaries Mouths, by <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>asking them, <q>How it comes to paſs that that which diſſolves the Meat in the Stomack, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be Heat, Ferment, or Putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, does not diſſolve the Stomack al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, ſince it diſſolves not only Meat of the ſame kind, but that which is much more ſolid?</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>I verily believe, that not only the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor himſelf, but his Admirers alſo thinks this an inſurmountable difficulty, which no doubt has made him reject theſe Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and imbrace one ſo abſurd, as his will be found. It is ſtrange to ſee how Men are in love with their own Dreams and Deluſions, and how they ſee other Mens Faults, and are blind to their own. For the ſame Objection that is againſt theſe Opinions, holds againſt the Doctor's. For if he ask them, how it comes to paſs that the Stomack is not diſſolved as well
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:62611:60"/>
as the Meat in it? They may ask him, how it comes that the Stomack by bruiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and grinding Meat of the ſame nature with it ſelf, and much more ſolid too, is not grinded to duſt and crumbled away to nothing long ere now? The Doctor Anſwers, That whatever damage the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack ſuſtains that way, is ſoon repaired by the Blood. Whatever force is in this, it makes as much for any of the contrary Opinions as for his; and ſo the Stygian Lake, or Chymiſts Laboratory, or Cooks Shop, or Dung-hill, may maintain its Right againſt the Mill. I am ſure none but theſe that think very litle, or drink very much, would find any difficulty in this which puzells this learned Man ſo ſore, that he thinks it unanſwerable. For the things which we digeſt, cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be ſaid to be of the ſame nature with our Stomack, or other parts of our Body; for they differ as much as living things and dead: For what we eat muſt firſt die, and ceaſe to be nouriſhed, before it can be digeſted. And were the Stomack and other parts of the Body of the ſame
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:62611:60"/>
nature, as the Profeſſor alledgeth, with theſe things we digeſt, we ſhould ly under the ſame neceſſity of preſerving our Bodies with divers Pickles and Spices, as we are to keep Beef and Mutton from corrupting with Salt; and ſo we ſhould be all talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and walking <hi>Mummies.</hi> But leſt the Doctor nnderſtand not this, I remit him to the School-maſter of Fools for inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, who will inform him that Worms live frequently in the Stomack, in ſpight of Heat, Fermentation, Putrefaction, &amp;c' and ſometimes in ſpight of Phyſick and Phyſicians too.</p>
                     <p>Thus you ſee the Profeſſor has given his Adverſaries a Morſel they can never concoct: But leſt it may chance to putrifie, he muſt prevent that too, and take ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther word of Dr. <hi>Liſter:</hi> For the Profeſſor cannot away with this old muſty ſtinking Opinion, and no wonder, for it turns his Mill into a Jacks, and makes it good for nothing but grinding T—s. <q>There are other Reaſons, ſays he, why we reject the Opinion of the learned Mr. <hi>Liſter.</hi> For this Gentleman will needs have the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:62611:61"/>
Meat to rot in the Stomack, becauſe it is in a warm place, without the Animal. But this (ſays the Doctor) does not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the Queſtion, for one may ſtill ask, What is the reaſon that Fleſh out of the Stomack does not corrupt or putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie ſo ſoon, or if it do, it does not turn to Chile? Which nevertheleſs the ſame Fleſh will do in the Stomack, in a very litle time.</q> This is juſt ſuch a Queſtion as if one would ask, Wherefore the wind of the Microcoſm ſmells worſe than that of the Macrocoſm, and why the Vapours pent up there corrupt ſo ſoon? But I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Doctor does not ſee that this will put the Water by his Mill, and hinder it to go, except he make it go with wind, of which he never wants plenty. For I would ask him, How it comes to paſs, that the Stomack of any Animal, taken out and fill'd with Meat, and preſſed between the two Hands, never turns the Meat into Chile, which nevertheleſs it will do in a very ſhort time when the Stomack is in the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal? The Doctor will readily<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Anſwer, that it is not Motion conſidered in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:62611:61"/>
that is the Cauſe of Concoction, but a certain kind of Motion, ſo and ſo cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantiat, peculiar to the Stomack. So will his Adverſary reply, that it is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain kind of Putrefaction that cannot be defined, and yet Putrefaction it is, or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption ſtill, and is a juſter Notion of the thing than any I have met with. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the Opinions I have met with, none is ſo ridiculous and abſurd as the Doctor's, as he has ſtated it. For to tell us, that the motion of the Stomack may contribute to the Concoction, is that which no Body will deny: But to ſay it is the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dequat efficient Cauſe (for the Doctor aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns no other) is every whit as abſurd as to affirm, that becauſe Meat helps to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve our Life, therefore we need neither Drink, Sleep, nor Air. Yea it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt to any conſidering Man, that from the Motion of the Stomack we can no more have an Idea or Notion of Conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, than from the Idea of a Wind-mill, we can frame one of a Solan-gooſe.</p>
                     <p>But notwithſtanding of the Abſurdity of this Opinion, I am content to let it paſs
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:62611:62"/>
for it uſefulneſs. What can be of more excellent uſe than this Doctrine? For ſick People whoſe Stomacks are weak, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion bad, may have Chile prepared in a Dog's Stomack, which muſt be taken out of the Dog either dead or alive, and any kind of Meat put into it you pleaſe, which by toſſing up and down a few Hours will turn into Chile, fit for nouriſhing the Patient, whoſe Throat if it chance to be cloſed, it may be injected into the Veins. This new Invention will quite diſcard Conſumes and Gelees, and in place of that Phyſicians will order thus. R. <hi>Chyli bene praeparati &amp; in ventri: cani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

After all we are no further concerned with Concoction, than to know what is eaſily concocted: And to take care that there be ſome proportion between the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid and the liquid, otherwiſe the Mill will never grind well, whatever ſome Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians may ſay to the contrary.</p>
                     <p>I am now come to the Doctor's laſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertation, <hi>De circulatione ſanguinis in anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libus genitis &amp; non genitis,</hi> which is the moſt ſublime of all, &amp; very proper to crown the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:62611:62"/>
work: For the other Diſcourſes were but Medico-mathematical, but this is Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matico-medical. It is dedicat <hi>Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum Amantibus, To Our Right Truſty and well beloved Couſins and Counſellers the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians, greeting.</hi> I can compare it to nothing ſo fitly as a Beggar's Cloak, which is made up of Clouts of divers Colours, ſome new, ſome old: Or rather to a frugal Supper, where the cold Meat that was left at Dinner, is ſerved up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to furniſh out the Table, with the addition of ſome litle Kick-chaws. For the Doctor preſents you here with a cold Diſh of his <hi>Problem de Inventoribus</hi> war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med again.</p>
                     <p>The principal Deſign of this Diſcourſe is to demonſtrat the Advantages that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounds to the World by the Diſcovery of the Circulation of the Blood. But before the Doctor come to this, he demonſtrats that <hi>Harvey</hi> was the firſt Diſcoverer of this great Miſtery, and that the good old Man <hi>Hippocrat</hi> knew no more of it than he did of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Tongue: And he is ſo hot and eager in the purſuit of this, that
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:62611:63"/>
one would think he had forgot his main End, and himſelf too.</p>
                     <p>The Circulation of the Blood (ſays the Doctor in the beginning of his <hi>Diſſert:) is the ground and foundation of all Medicine.</hi> And therefore we need not wonder that he look on the Ancients with an Eye of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain and contempt, as ignorant Dunces, ſince they were ignorant of this Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, on which Medicine is built: And deſpiſe alſo the Moderns, who though they know it, ſtill practiſe after the old faſhion, and uſe Derivations and Revul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Blooding at different parts of the Body. And therefore if thoſe deſerve to be beaten with few ſtripes, theſe deſerve to be ſoundly whip'd: For thoſe were blind, but theſe have Eyes and ſee not, and no wonder ſince they make no uſe of Mathematical Spectacles. Let us hear then the practical Improvement the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor has made of this Noble Invention? The original Cauſe of the Apoplexy, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy, Coma and other Diſeaſes of the Brain, were as litle known to the Ancients (if we give Credit to the Doctor) as the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:62611:63"/>
Head of Nile. The Divine <hi>Hippocrat</hi> himſelf was forced to recur to the <hi>aſylum ignorantiae</hi> of <hi>Divine:</hi> And the Moderns for all their fair and ſpecious pretences, have ſaid no more. And no wonder ſince they ſought the Cauſe where it was not, imagining it was to be found in the Nerves and Pores of the Brain, whereas all this time it lurk'd in the Arteries like a Fox in his Den, and might have done ſo ſtill, had not this Mathematical Hunter, get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Advantage of the Wind, ferreted it out of its Hole. Now if you deſire to know how the Doctor found out the true Cauſe of theſe Diſeaſes? It was by the Mathematicks, as you ſhall ſee by and by. For after a tedious Diſcourſe of the different Figures of the Conduits or Veſſels through which the Fluids run, ſome whereof have their ſides convergent, ſome divergent, and others paralel, he concludes that it is chiefly in thoſe whoſe ſides are convergent, where reaſonably we may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect Obſtructions: And ſince the Arteries are ſuch, we are to ſeek the Cauſe of the above-mentioned Diſeaſes in theſe, which
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:62611:64"/>
formerly was ſuppoſed to ly in the Nerves. The Caſe is plainly thus in a few words.</p>
                     <p>The Veſſels or Conduits through which any Liquor runs, are either ſuch as are larger and wider, at the place where the motion begins, and become ſtill narrower and narrower the further they go: Or narrower where the motion begins in them, and ſtill grow wider the farther they go: Or they are equally wide all along from the one end to the other. We have not, according to the Doctor, much reaſon to ſuſpect any Obſtructions in the two laſt, but only in the firſt, becauſe what goes in at one end, will eaſily go out at the other, and therefore we are to ſeek them chiefly in the Arteries, which grow ſtill narrower the further they are from the Heart; which come to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed thus, according to the Doctor. <q>The litle ſolid Particles that ſweem in arterial Blood, when they come to meet together in any part of the Arterey, where the paſſage is ſtrait, make as it were a kind of Arch, or Vault, which is ſupported by the ſides of the Artery
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:62611:64"/>
inclining one towards another. And it is evident (ſays he) that this Bar, or Stop, will be the ſtronger the more it is preſſed by the current of the Blood.</q> And thus you have the true Cauſe of the Obſtructions that befall the Arteries ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarly by the Laws of Mecaniſm. But there is one thing eſpecially to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the building of Arches, which is, That the Butreſſes or Supports on which the Arch ſtands, be ſuch as will not eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yield, otherwiſe down it comes in a trice. Now the ſides of the Arteries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a perpetual motion, it will be as hard to build a Bridge between them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> while we are alive, as to build a Caſtle in the Air: And therefore the only fit time to begin this geometrical Arch is, when we are dead: For the motion of the Arteries being then ceaſed, there is ſure Ground for laying the Foundation. By which you may underſtand what a falſe and groundleſs Notion this is, That Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions are more frequent in the Arteries than in the Veins or Nerves, which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the difference of the Figure would oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:62611:65"/>
if all other things were equal; but the perpetual motion of theſe, marrs all. But falſe and groundleſs as it is, it is all the Argument the Doctor has to refute the Opinion of <hi>Sylvius</hi> and <hi>Willis:</hi> Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, he proceeds to explain his own Opinion of ſleepy Diſeaſes, as Apoplexy, Lethargy, &amp;c. and at the ſame time gives us a juſt account of the nature of <hi>Opium.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>It is evident (ſays he Parag. 24.) that upon the taking of <hi>Opium</hi> there follows a warm Sweat, and that the Blood in the beginning is rarified. If therefore ſuch a quantity of <hi>Opium</hi> be taken, as may rarifie the Blood in the Brain to ſuch a degree, that the litle Arteries that are mixed with the Nerves there, may preſs them more than ordinary, and ſo hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the free paſſage of the nervous Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, the Creature will ſeem to ſleep, and all theſe things will fall out which we obſerve in ſleep and ſleepy Diſeaſes, proceeding from a Cauſe within the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels. Whence it follows (ſaith he Par. 25.) that Wine and Spirit of Wine, and all Liquors that are rarified eaſily and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:62611:65"/>
ſuddenly, by heat or any other way, may occaſion Sleep and ſleepy Diſeaſes.

                     <p>One would think, that while the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor is ſpeaking of ſleepy Diſeaſes, and the Qualities of <hi>Opium,</hi> that he were aſleep himſelf, or had taken a Grain or two of the Juice of the Poppie, this Diſcourſe looks ſo like Raving. For if the Cauſe of Sleep, and ſleepy Diſeaſes, be the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifaction of the Blood, then every thing that rarifies the Maſs of the Blood would occaſion theſe Diſeaſes, that is, every thing that is proper for Curing the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexy, &amp;c. would likwiſe occaſion it: As Spirit of Hart-horn, ſalt Armoniack, Oyl of Amber, Roſemary, Tincture of C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>So much of the nature of ſleepy Diſeaſes and their Cure, both Mathematically ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained. I come next to examine the ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niferous quality of <hi>Opium.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I will not trouble you at preſent with the different Opinions either of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents or Moderns, concerning the Nature
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:62611:66"/>
and Virtues of <hi>Opium,</hi> eſpecially where its ſomniferous quality lies. Some main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it was Heat, others Cold; ſome a Viſcoſity, others a Narcotick, Sulphur, &amp;c. But moſt were of Opinion, that it is an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Quality, that is to ſay, they knew not what it was. And this no doubt is the only right Opinion, and is excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well expreſſed by <hi>Thomas Diaphorus</hi> in the <hi>Malade Imaginare. Quare facit Opium dormire</hi> Thoma? <hi>Quia habet virtutem dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitivam.</hi> No doubt the Profeſſor thinks this a very ridiculous Anſwer, otherwiſe he had never given himſelf the trouble to ſeek out another, which nevertheleſs upon trial will be found to bear the ſame Image and Superſcription.</p>
                     <p>But the Profeſſor muſt ſay ſomething: He is obliged to it by his place: For one that has a publick Salary for Talking or Writing, is obliged to chat, tho he ſhould ſpeak Nonſenſe; as well as a Town-piper is bound to play through the Streets Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Evening, though he ſhould play quite out of Tune. For a dumb Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor is as uſeleſs a thing, as a Piper that
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:62611:67"/>
wants the nether Chops, or a Fiddle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Strings.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Opium</hi> then, according to the Doctor, makes one ſleep, becauſe it rarifies the Blood, which is evident, ſays he, becauſe it provokes a warm Sweat; Whence it follows clearly, that every thing that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifies the Blood, <hi>i. e.</hi> every thing that makes one ſweat will provoke Sleep, and have all the other Virtues of <hi>Opium, i. e.</hi> all <hi>Sudorificks</hi> will be <hi>Opiats, i. e.</hi> this is all ſtark Nonſenſe. But Nonſenſe as it is, many Advantages attend it. We ſhall not need to go far to find <hi>Laudanum,</hi> for almoſt every thing will afford it in plenty Sometimes, <hi>you know what,</hi> may ſupply its place, for the very ſight of it, much more the ſmell or taſte, will make one ſweat. Yea the moſt troubleſome and uneaſie Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions we are ſubject to, even thoſe that diſturb our Reſt and hinder Sleep, will furniſh us with a <hi>Quieting Draught:</hi> For Anger and Vexation, &amp;c. which make Men ſweat to purpoſe by their <hi>Sudorifick, i. e.</hi> their <hi>Somniferous</hi> Quality, will quickly
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:62611:67"/>
allay our Paſſions and lull us aſleep, even as
<q>
                           <l>—Dolor eſt Medicina doloris.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>By this you may clearly ſee, that <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Diaforus</hi> and the Profeſſor, give the ſame Anſwer in different Terms: And no wonder, ſince great Wits for the moſt part agree. <hi>Thomas</hi> ſays that <hi>Opium</hi> makes one ſleep becauſe it has a ſleeping Quality in it: And the Profeſſor tells us, it is becauſe it has a rarifying Quality. But ſince eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that rarifies the Maſs of the Blood (that is, every thing that makes us ſweat) does not provoke Sleep, this rarifying Quality of <hi>Opium</hi> muſt have ſome ſpecia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity or ſpecifick Virtue in it, that no Body knows, <hi>i. e.</hi> an occult Quality, a ſleepy Virtue, <hi>Virtutem dormitivam. Which was the thing to be demonſtrat.</hi> Now ſince the Profeſſor has anſwered every whit as well as <hi>Thomas,</hi> no Body in Juſtice can refuſe him the ſame Complement. <hi>Bene reſponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, dignus eſt intrare in noſtro docto corpore,</hi> and to be a Profeſſor in any Univerſity of <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="134" facs="tcp:62611:68"/>
But I muſt ask the Profeſſor one Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion about <hi>Opium</hi> before I have done, which is, That ſince Sleep and ſleepy Diſeaſes are occaſioned by the Dilatation of the ſmall Arteries in the Brain, which preſs the Nerves, how it comes to paſs, that the Arteries that are intermixed with the Nerves that ſerve for Reſpiration and the motion of the Heart, are not preſſed as well as thoſe which ſerve for voluntary motion and ſenſation, and conſequently why Sleep does not alway occaſion a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of Breathing? To this the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor anſwers very wittily, <q>That the Heart which is a Muſcle, and the Muſcles or the Breaſt have no Antagoniſts, and therefore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> Animal Spirits will do their turn.</q> And therefore though it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Nerves that go to the Heart and Breaſt muſt be preſſed by the Arteries, as well as the reſt, yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Pulſe nor Breath get any ſenſible hurt by it, when the Doſe is moderat, or the Sleep natural: Becauſe a very few Spirits is ſufficient for this great Work, there being no Antagoniſt Muſcles in hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:62611:68"/>
it: And very litle will do a great deal where there is no oppoſition in the way.</p>
                     <p>Now this Diſcourſe of the Doctor's a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Antagoniſt Muſcles, is antagoniſt to Truth, and antipodes to Senſe and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. As for the Heart, its Diaſtole is as natural as its Syſtole: And tho it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid to have an antagoniſt Muſcle, yet it has the equivalent; yea in my opinion a ſtronger Adverſary to graple with: For, beſides the <hi>motus reſtitutionis,</hi> which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry near in kin to antagoniſt Muſcle, it has the Blood to ſquirt out into the Arteries, which requires no ſmall force. But any Body that has ſeen live Diſſections, and thruſt their Finger into the Heart of a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Animal, will find that no ſmall ſtock of Spirits is neceſſary for ſuch a task.</p>
                     <p>What he ſays concerning the Muſcles of the Breaſt, is ſo groſs a Miſtake, that the meaneſt Student in Medicine would be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

over again, and he will find the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Is the <hi>Sacrolumbar,</hi> the <hi>Triangular</hi> and the <hi>Internal Intercoſtals</hi> of no force at all? Here is the depth of Anatomy. But if thoſe be not ſufficient alone, they have the confederat Troops of their Allies, the muſcular Fibers of the <hi>Aſpera arteria</hi> or Wind-pipe to aſſiſt them at a Call. And I aſſure you ſometimes they ſtand in need of their help; as in the Acts of Cough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Singing, Laughing, &amp;c. all acts of Expiration, in which the Breaſt is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and require more Spirits than any act of Inſpiration I know. But why ſhould we multiply Cauſes without neceſſity? Gravity alone is ſufficient to do the thing, thus. When we breath in Air, the Chiſt of the Breaſt is inlarged, and the Ribs are pulled upwards, in ſo much that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blique Angles they made with the Back<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>bone, becomes right ones; all which is performed by the Muſcles that ſerve for Inſpiration; and when theſe remit thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> action, the Breaſt by its own native Gra<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>vity falls down again, and ſhrinks into i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
                        <pb n="137" facs="tcp:62611:69"/>
Muſcles pull it up by the Ears again. And this is the Doctor's Opinion of the matter, in his Diſcourſe, <hi>De cauſis diverſae molis,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>This Doctor is the luckieſt Man that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver breath'd, for finding out <hi>Succedaneums</hi> or <hi>Quid</hi>'s <hi>pro Quo</hi>'s. We wanted here an Antagoniſt Muſcle to help the Breaſt down again. The Doctor tells us, the weight will ſupply the place, no more is neceſſary. We tumble down the Hill of our own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, but we muſt have force and ſtrength to mount up again. Now the weight of the Breaſt being ſufficient for the act of Expiration, and doing the duty of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſt Muſcle muſt reſiſt the act of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiratton, as much as if it were one, and therefore there will be need of the ſame ſupply of animal Spirits, to overcome this weighty Adverſary, which would be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to vanquiſh an antagoniſt Muſcle: And conſequently the ſame Doſe of <hi>Opium</hi> that makes one ſleep, would ſtop both the motion of the Heart and Breaſt, if its ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niferous Virtue be ſuch as the Doctor has aſſigned: Yea, Sleep it ſelf would kill without Mercy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="138" facs="tcp:62611:70"/>
From this Opinion, that Expiration is performed by the weight of the Breaſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> many weighty Inſtructions may be dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced for the good of Mankind.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> is for Nurſes, either wet or dry, that they take ſpecial care, when they hold out Children, that their breech be not higher than their Breaſt: For in this poſture, if they chance to breath in Air, which they muſt needs do, in order to blow ſomething out at the other end, if in this poſture, I ſay, when the Ribs make right Angles with the <hi>Spina dorſi,</hi> they chance either to be perpendicular to the Horizon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or make acute Angles with it, in a very few Minuts the Child will dye, tho not breath out its laſt; becauſe there is no antagoniſt Muſcle to draw the Ribs down again, and the weight cannot determine them one way more than another, while they are pendicular, and in the other Caſe it will determine them the quite contrary way. They muſt alſo take notice then Children never go on all Four; for then the Gravity which ſerved for Expiration will now help Inſpiration; by which means
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:62611:70"/>
the motion of the Breaſt will ceaſe, and the Infant breath in its laſt.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Next</hi> Inſtruction is for Jockies and Ferriers, to teach them how to Cure wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broken Horſes. Which is done by making them walk on their hinder Legs upright, or ly on their Back: For in either of theſe poſtures the weight helps the Expiration, but in their natural poſture it hinders it.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Third</hi> and laſt is for Trumpeters and Pipers, &amp;c. who to make them blow better, ſhould lay a weight on their Breaſt, as Smiths do on their Bellows, which will very much help their Expiration: And even Experience teacheth us, that preſſing the Belly will make one rift at the wrong End, which is a kind of Expiration too. Are not theſe uſeful Inſtructions both for Man and Beaſt?</p>
                     <p>By what has been ſaid, any Body may be fully ſatisfied of the power and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of this Geometrical Method in Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, and that the Mathematicks are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolately neceſſary for a Phyſician; even al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together as much as the knowledge of the Cheſs is for the General of an Army. And
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:62611:71"/>
that you may not take this for a Jeſt, I muſt tell you it was pronounced in earneſt by the infallible Judge of Controverſies the Pope, in favours of one of his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews; for which he gave theſe Reaſons, it being pronounced <hi>extra Cathedram.</hi> He that underſtands the Cheſs, ſaid he, knows how to muſter his Men, to draw them up in battle Rank, to Attack, Defend, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify his Camp, Purſue his Victory, Secure his Retreat, &amp;c. And theſe are the only Qualifications neceſſary for a General. Now no Body can deny but that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor has at leaſt as fair a Plea for Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in his Concluſions pronounced in <hi>Cathedra,</hi> as the Pope has for his Deciſions <hi>extra Cathedram.</hi> From all which it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows clearly that the Mathematicks are as neceſſary for the one, as to play at Cheſs for the other.</p>
                     <p>But leſt you call the Profeſſor's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in queſtion, I'll draw the paralel more exactly, and ſhew you that there is juſt as much reaſon for the one as the other, there being the ſame affinity between Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine and Mathematicks, that is between
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:62611:71"/>
the Art of War and the Cheſs. For Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine is nothing but the Art of making War againſt the Enemies of the Microcoſm, theſe <hi>Hoſtes humani generis.</hi> And the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, who is the Wariour, muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand how to fortify the Place regularly, and defend it againſt the Attacks of the Enemy. And this is that part of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine we call the <hi>Preſervative.</hi> He muſt likeways know, how to expell the Enemy when entered the place, either by Force or Stratagem; to beat them off with Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets of <hi>Mercury,</hi> and blow them up with <hi>Jeſuits-powder,</hi> which is as neceſſary in Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine as Gun-powder in War. Now no Man is able to do this well, and to purpoſe, but he that underſtands Fortification, which is a part of the Mathematicks. <hi>Ergo</hi> no Man can be a good Phyſician except he be a Mathematician. <hi>Q. E. D.</hi>
                     </p>

its Author is not only a deep Philoſopher, and profound Mathematician, but the moſt eminent Phyſician that ever this poor Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was bleſt with.

follow from the Principles laid down in the one and the other; yet I do not accuſe this learned Man of any thing but ſublime In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advertency. Some Men ſpeak before they think, and theſe for the moſt part know not what they ſay; and ſo can hardly be guilty of Malice, tho they may be accuſed of Raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But ſince he that kills a Man by meer Inadvertency, as really kills him as he that does it deliberatly and on deſign, and the damage is the ſame, tho the guilt is not. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I would adviſe theſe blind <hi>Archers,</hi> not to ſhoot any more at random, nor draw their Bow at a venture: For they may do more Miſchief than they are aware of. And if they continue to do ſo after Admonition, that which in Charity was thought Raſhneſs before, will now juſtly be reckoned Malice and Deſign; and the Offender no longer a <hi>Man-ſlayer,</hi> but a <hi>Murderer.</hi>

who make the learned Mob ſtand ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed at the wit and profoundneſs of their idle Chat, as if they had ſeen the <hi>Gorgons</hi> Head: And a Gnat is not more troubleſome with its litle Sting and Buzz, than theſe Smaterers with their ſmall Sophiſtry. Theſe <hi>Wits</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently tell us, That nothing is certain but a Mathematical Demonſtration, and that all hiſtorical Certainty amounts to no more but a meer Conjecture, and that the beſt atteſted Hiſtory is litle better than a Romance: Tho the beſt Reaſons they bring to maintain this Paradox, are litle better than the Dreams of <hi>Enthuſiaſts,</hi> or Ravings of ſick Folks.

A DISCOURSE of CERTAINTY.</head>
                  <p>THERE is Nothing more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain than that Something is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: And he that maintains the contrary gives himſelf the lie. But what <hi>Certainty</hi> is, can better be conceived than expreſſed: For eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man at the hearing of the Word, if he underſtands the Language, has preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an Idea of what is meant by it. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we aſſent to, we think it either Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain or Probable: Our Aſſent to the Firſt is called <hi>Knowledge,</hi> which comprehends both that of Principles and Concluſions, which the Schools expreſs by <hi>Intelligentia &amp; Scientia:</hi> And our Aſſent to the Laſt is called <hi>Opinion</hi> or <hi>Conjecture.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some diſtinguiſh Knowledge or Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty into Three kinds, Phyſical, Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, and Moral. The two firſt of theſe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62611:77"/>
they call Infallible, not in an abſolute (for that is an Attribute of GOD) but a qualified Senſe, which ſuppoſes our Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to be true, and that we exert them aright: And the laſt they ſtile Indubitable Certainty. The Authors of this diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſeem to me to contradict themſelves: For they grant that Moral as well as Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical or Mathematical Certainty, excludes all kind of doubting whatſomever; and yet at the ſame time they deny, that it has as great evidence as theſe: That is to ſay, we have no more reaſon to doubt of what is Morally certain, than of what is Phyſically, or Mathematically ſo; tho we have not the ſame reaſon for believing the firſt, that we have for the two laſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> we have both the ſame Reaſon, and not the ſame Reaſon, to Believe, and not Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the ſame Things equally at the ſame time. The fault of theſe Men is, that they comprehend under Moral or Indubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Certainty, Things of a very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent nature, and, in my humble Opinion, confound Indubitable Certainty and high Probability together. For the Certainty
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62611:77"/>
that I have, that the Sun roſe Yeſterday, and that I have that it will riſe to Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, tho vaſtly different, are both ſtiled by them Indubitable; whereas only the former is ſuch: For tho the later be ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that I have no ſuch reaſon to doubt of it, as to be in continual fear of the contrary; yet it comes not up to the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the former, of which I have as great aſſurance, and every whit as well grounded, as of any Propoſit on in <hi>Euclid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Opinion</hi> or <hi>Conjecture,</hi> is an Aſſent given to things leſs clear and plain, for which tho a great deal may be ſaid, yet the Proof does not ariſe to that degree of Evidence, as to beget a Certainty that excludes all reaſonable doubt, and fear of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And theſe are the two Heads to which Aſſent is reducible.</p>
                  <p>Agreeable to this our problematick Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor in his <hi>Problem Pag.</hi> 12. teaches us, That whatever things we aſſent to, are either ſuch as are <hi>Demonſtrat</hi> or not <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrat.</hi> 
                     <q>By things demonſtrat (ſays he <hi>ibid:)</hi> I underſtand, <hi>Ea quorum proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones conficiunt impoſſibile eſſe ut ipſa ſe ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>

                  <p>One at firſt ſight would think, that the Dr. were of the ſame mind with thoſe I juſt now mentioned, but there is a vaſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. For theſe maintain, that beſide Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical and Mathematical, there is likeways a Moral Certainty, which is as certain as any of the two; and that many Matters of fact are capable of this kind of Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Whereas this learned Man holds, that nothing is infallibly certain, but a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration; and that all other Certainty,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62611:78"/>
even that which depends on the faith of Hiſtory, is nothing but Probability and meer Conjecture; and conſequently all the Infallible or Indubitable Certainty we can expect from any Hiſtory, tho never ſo well atteſted, is, That it is infallibly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain; becauſe all Hiſtory whatſoever ſuppoſeth, according to this learned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, ſome things that cannot be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrat, which weakens exceedingly its credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and makes it amount to no more but a <hi>may be.</hi> But that I may not be thought to miſtake the Dr. let us hear him out, that we may the better underſtand his meaning:</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now if you conſider the Matter well, you ſhall find that this Doctrine ſtrikes at the Root, and ſhakes the Foundation of all hiſtorical Certainty, whether the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory be Sacred or Profane: For the one as well as the other ſuppoſeth and takes for granted the Second and Third <hi>Effatum,</hi> (according to the Doctor) that is, it ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth ſomething to be true, which for any thing we know is falſe, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Belief that is built on it; for ſuch as the Foundation is, ſuch will the Building be: And every Body knows that Concluſions have the ſame kind of Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, with the Principles themſelves from which they are deduced: For Truth like Water will riſe no higher than its Fountain. But I ſhall examine his Concluſions one by one, and ſhow you how Sound and Solid, <hi>i. e.</hi> how Senſeleſs and Ridiculous they are.</p>
                  <p>The Firſt is not only Pernicious and Abſurd, but down-right Nonſenſe: For it is contrary to Senſe and Reaſon, and the common Sentiments of Mankind, <hi>viz.</hi> that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62611:80"/>
I cannot be ſo certain of any Matter of fact of which I was not a Witneſs, as of a Demonſtration, as indeed ſome Matters of fact were not as capable of being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrat their own way, as any Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>Euclid;</hi> and which we can no more doubt of, nor disbelieve, than we can of Problems about Lines or Numbers, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing manifeſt violence to our own Convictions. For they carry ſuch an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence along with them, as determines al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt neceſſarly our Aſſent, and which no unprejudiced Mind can withſtand, tho it is poſſible that Malice and Peeviſhneſs may defeat their efficacy: And ſo it may too, if it pleaſe, over-rule the Power of Mathematical Demonſtration: Which if it thwarted Mens Luſts, and croſſed their vitious Inclinations, would meet with as much Contradiction as Moral Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion does.</p>
                  <p>Have not theſe that have writ of the truth of the Chriſtian Religion, as clearly demonſtrat that there was ſuch a one as <hi>CHRIST JESUS,</hi> Who was Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> roſe again from the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62611:80"/>
Dead, &amp;c. as any thing can be: Matters of fact that the greateſt Adverſaries to the Truth never had the impudence to deny. It was good luck that <hi>Celſus</hi> and <hi>Porphyrie</hi> and the reſt of that gang, were not lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned enough in the Mathematicks, to find out this flaw of the <hi>Non demonſtrata.</hi> For it had been eaſie for them to have ſtopt the Mouths of their Adverſaries thus. This Hiſtory which you believe ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and takes for granted ſome things to be true, which may be falſe, a cheat and lie, ſuch as no wiſe Man would truſt his Life and Fortune to, much leſs his higheſt and greateſt concern. Thus you ſee what a brave thing it is to be <hi>Troppo Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tico.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The 2. Concluſion is all of a piece with the firſt, equally Pernicious, Abſurd and Ridiculous. For according to it I can never be ſo certain that ever there was ſuch a Man as King <hi>James</hi> the Sixth, or <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, as if I had ſeen them. From which alſo it follows, that no Man can ever be certain that he was born of a Woman; yea for ought he knows, he
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62611:81"/>
was hatched under a Hen, or grew out of the Ground like a Cabbage; which is ſo ridiculous, that a Child of Ten Years old would refute it, from the Principles of common Senſe. Let me ſuppoſe then a Dialogue between ſome learned Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matician and this Child.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Math.</hi> Come hither my pretty litle Rogue, prethee tell me, was thou born of a Woman? <hi>Child.</hi> What does think that I was hatched under a Hen, or grew out of the Ground like a Cabbage. <hi>Math.</hi> For any thing, Child, you know it is ſo. <hi>Ch.</hi> For any thing I know you are Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocondriack. <hi>Math.</hi> Hold your peace, Child, did you ſee your ſelf born. <hi>Ch.</hi> If I did, I do not remember. <hi>Math.</hi> How then do you know that you was born of a Woman? <hi>Ch.</hi> How do I know? Marry my Father and Mother, and all the Neighbour-hood told me ſo much; are not all Children born of Women? <hi>Math.</hi> That is the Queſtion Child. Is any Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy alive that ſaw you born? Or has any Body writ the Hiſtory of your Birth. <hi>Ch.</hi> I know nothing of all that. <hi>Math.</hi> Then
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62611:81"/>
Child many things being alledged here to to be certain that are not demonſtrat, and ſo may be falſe, you can never be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain you was born of a Woman. As <hi>Firſt,</hi> That theſe who pretend they ſaw you born, had ſo much honeſty, as to tell no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Truth: Which is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrat according to the 2. <hi>Effatum. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> Suppoſing the Witneſſes are dead, that theſe who heard it from them, told it to others juſt as they heard it: Which is not demonſtrat according to the 3. <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatum. Thirdly,</hi> There being no written Hiſtory of your Birth, but only Tradition, you muſt ſuppoſe the Memories of thoſe by whom you pretend to know the thing, to be ſo faithful, that they forgot no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the whole Matter: Which is not demonſtrat according to the 4. <hi>Effatum.</hi> Now all theſe being ſuppoſed for true, which nevertheleſs may be falſe, it may be you have been hatched under a Hen, or grown up like a Cabbage, or dropt from a Tree like a Bernacle or Cleg-gooſe; and therefore Child take heed you fall not into the Hands of ſome <hi>French Papiſt,</hi>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:62611:82"/>
who may eat you on a Fiſh-day for a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creuſe,</hi> without tranſgreſſing the Rules of his Church, which no doubt has the ſame power to make Fleſh Fiſh, that it has to make Bread Fleſh: And tho you ſhould eſcape this, yet either <hi>Proteſtant</hi> or <hi>Papiſt</hi> may make a Diſh of Cabbage of you, or a Fricaſie of Chickens. <hi>Ch.</hi> I thank you for your Advice: But in the mean time take you care not to fall into the Hands of the Keepers of <hi>Bedlam,</hi> who, if they catch you, will certainly lock you up for a Mad-man.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Third</hi> Concluſion is a wedge of the ſame Timber, every whit as ſenſeleſs as the former. For I can be as ſure of the truth of ſome Hiſtories, and Thouſands of Matters of fact, as I had been an Ear and an Eye Witneſs, and the Firſt Authors could pretend to no more. Do not I know as certainly that there is ſuch a Place as <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and that the one is the Seat of the <hi>Pope,</hi> and the other the Reſidence of the <hi>Grand Signor,</hi> as if I had ſeen them with my Eyes, and this is ſo evident, that one would be taken
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62611:82"/>
for a Mad-man that would call it in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
                  <p>And for the Antiquity of a Hiſtory, it is the firſt time that ever I heard, that it derogates any thing from the Credit of it. It is not the oldneſs of the Hiſtory that leſſens its Credibility, but its being weakly atteſted in the beginning: the ſmall Authority it had decays with Time, that tries all, and at laſt may chance to periſh and die. But a Hiſtory that has been well atteſted in the beginning, and has ſet up upon a ſufficient ſtock of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, will never crack its Credit, nor prove Bank-rupt with time, but rather

And ſo return to the Place from whence they came. And I am ſure the Doctor will approve the Condemnation of theſe Criminals, who have not only kill'd Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical Truth, but baſely murdered Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical, by ſtabbing it to the very

For Mathematical Certainty, as well as Hiſtorical Suppoſes ſome <hi>Non de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrata,</hi> and conſequently, according to the Doctor, muſt labour under ſome degree of Uncertainty, and ſo all Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Demonſtrations will at beſt prove nothing but high Probabilities. For the Truth and Certainty of a Mathematical Demonſtration, eſpecially if it be ſuch as depends on a long train of forgoing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, which again muſt depend on ſo many Definitions, Axioms and Poſtulats<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſuppoſeth things that are not, and cannot be demonſtrat (according to the Doctor) and ſo muſt take up its Quarters with poor miſerable Hiſtorical Certainty.

For ſince no Man can have an intuitive knowledge, of all the forgoing Propoſitions, Axioms and Poſtulats, on which this Concluſion depends, (which tho he had, is but fallible at beſt) and an objective Evidence of their Truth, all at one view, he muſt content himſelf to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that he once knew them, and truſt his poor frail Memory for all, which frail as it is he muſt ſuppoſe to be infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, before he can have ſuch an aſſurance of this Truth, as excludes all doubting: And ſo Mathematical Certainty muſt ſtand upon the ſame bottom with Hiſtorical: And conſequently either Hiſtorical Truth muſt be as certain as Mathematical, or Mathematical as uncertain as Hiſtorical.</p>
                  <p>It is norhing to the purpoſe that ſome object, That many Fables and Fictions have paſſed for true, and many ſuch are believed and inrertained in the World to this day as certain, that are meer idle Tales
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62611:84"/>
and Stories. For this is no more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to Hiſtorical<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Certainty, than it is to Mathematical, that not only Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities but Paralogiſms; yea even ſome Dreams paſs current for Demonſtrations. Nor is it of any more force what others alledge, that Hiſtorical Truth has as much Certainty as it is capable of, but it is no more but Hiſtorical ſtill. Hiſtorical Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty it is, but Hiſtorical Certainty is as certain in its kind, as Phyſical or Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical are in their kinds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the one derogates no more, from the other, than the Certainty of Seeing from the Certainty of Hearing: For tho I cannot ſee with my Ears, nor hear with my Eyes; yet both Hearing and Seeing are equally certain, tho of different kinds, and I can be as infallibly certain I hear a Sound, as that I ſee a Colour.</p>
                  <p>Much more might be ſaid on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, did not its own native Evidence and Perſpicuity ſuperſed any further Proof or Illuſtration thereof. And what I have ſaid is ſufficient to convince any unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced Mind. As for thoſe who are reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62611:85"/>
to be humorſome and wilful, and ſmoother the greateſt Convictions, and ſtiffle the cleareſt Evidence, it were in vain to attempt to convince ſuch by Reaſon, who ſtand more in need of Helebor: which if they refuſe (for ſome mad Folks will take nothing by the Mouth) the wiſe <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> has left us an excellent Receipt, <hi>A whip for the Aſs, a bridle for the Horſe, and a rod for the Fools back.</hi> And yet I muſt confeſs that ſome of thoſe poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures deſerve rather Pity than Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and want more the Prayers of the Church, than the Sword of the Magiſtrat, for their Recovery; for it were breach of Charity to think they were not ſick of that Diſeaſe the Phyſicians call, <hi>Delirium ſine febre.</hi> For how can we imagine, that any but theſe that have not the exerciſe of their Reaſon, will deny the moſt manifeſt Truths, and give themſelves over to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Lies? And ſet up for great Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers and deep Clerks, becauſe they can break two or three dull Jeſts on the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and pretend to anſwer the ſtrongeſt Arguments with ſome pitiful Repartee,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62611:85"/>
which beſide that it is void of Reaſon, has ſcarce wit enough to tempt any Man to laugh beſide themſelves. But what to ſay of theſe Mens Admirers I know not; all the difference I know between them is, that the firſt for the moſt part are incurable, and the laſt incorrigeable Fools, being of that kind, whom tho you bray in a Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, yet will not their Folly depart from them.</p>
                  <p>I have now done, and (if I am not miſtaken) have ſufficiently vindicat the Truth from a Lie, and Phyſick and Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians from the groundleſs Aſperſions and falſe and miſtaken Notions of theſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical Quiblers, who will needs turn the World upſide down, and remove the ancient Land-marks our Fathers have ſet. And I am ſure whoever blame me for this, my learned Adverſary owes me Thanks, for opening his Eyes, and leting him ſee how injurions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the <hi>Learned Mob</hi> has been to him. For what greater Injury can be done to one, than to make him believe, that Buffonry is Wit, Pedantry Learning, and ſtark Nonſenſe the ſublimeſt Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62611:86"/>
and idle Dreams Mathematical Demonſtrations? But I am affraid I have been working to an unthankful Maſter, whoſe weak Eyes cannot indure the Light; and it may be in place of that which I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, I ſhall meet with the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and be challenged as an Accuſer of rhe Brethren of falſe Citations and Tranſlations and what not? Which is all the Anſwer I expect, and which no Body in reaſon can blame. For Nature, when it can do no better, will ſtrugle, and the <hi>Ultimus Naturae conatus</hi> was never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by any Law; yea even theſe <hi>Qui exeunt cum crepitu,</hi> are excuſable.</p>
