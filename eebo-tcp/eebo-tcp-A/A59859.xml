            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

By which extravagant Claims, he justly Forfeits even that Patriarchal Right, which the Canons of the Church formerly allowed him, in honour to the Imperial City, of which he was Bishop: For when a Grant upon meer Courtesy is impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into Tyranny and Usurpation, there is no Obligation to continue those Respects, which are now Challenged not upon Courtesy, but as an Original and Inviolable Right; and improved, from honourable Respects, into Empire and unlimited Jurisdiction. However, we need not trouble our selves with this Dispute. The Brittish Churches, for Six hundred Years after Christ, never had any Dependance on <hi>Rome</hi>; and what was after this was only Usurpation, and an usurped Authority may be renounced without Schism.</cell>

But, if the Schismatick should fall to their own share, they must take the Censure of St.</hi> Austin <hi>to themselves.</hi>

And this must be Schism; for nothing can justify a Separation, but a Corruption of Faith or Worship. But the Case is vastly different between us and the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> For we have not the same Creed, the same Sacraments, and the same Worship: The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> has added a great many new Articles to our Creed; has made a great many new Sacraments, and corrupted the old ones, and has introduced a new and strang Worship, the Worship of Saints and Angels, and Service in an Unknown Tongue, into the Christian Church. And this is the Reason not of our Separating from, but of their Flinging us out of their Communion. And this Case St. <hi>Austin</hi> says nothing of; but we are ready to prove, That it is no Schism.</p>

to justifie a Separation. For, in this Case, whoever separated from any Society of Christians, separated from the whole Christian Church; and nothing else was necessary to prove them Schismaticks, but only their Separation; which was as visible a Schism, as tearing an Arm or Leg from the Body. For when the whole Church was one Communion, without any Corruptions of Faith or Worship, there could be no Dispute which was the True Catholick Church; and to Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from the Catholick Church is certainly Schism. This was the Case of the Donatists, against whom St. <hi>Austin</hi> wrote that Book <hi>de Vnitate.</hi> They had nothing to object against the Faith or Worship of the Catholick Church; but only pretended, that they Communicated with Traditors, or those who were Ordained by them, that is, With those who, in the Times of Persecution, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered up their Bibles to the Persecutors; which yet was not so great a Fault as taking away the Bible from the People, (which if they had not had in those Days, they could not have delivered it) and persecuting those who use it.</p>
            <p>But when the Church is divided in Faith and Worship, into a great many different and opposite Communions, it is a ridiculous thing for any Part of the Church to call it self the Whole; and then to charge others, as St. <hi>Austin</hi> does the Donatists, with Separating from the Whole; especially, when such a Separation is occasioned by such Corruptions as are dangerous to Mens Souls. Which is vastly different from the state of the Church in St. <hi>Austin</hi>'s time; and therefore what he says cannot be immediately applied to us. They must first prove, that the Roman Church is the Catholick Church, and a Pure and Uncorrupt Church; and then we will grant, that not to Communicate with them is Schism.</p>
            <p n="e">E. <hi>This Church is the Body of</hi> Christ, <hi>as the Apostle saith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cap.</hi> 2.</note> Col. 1. 24. For his Body, which is his Church. <hi>Whence surely 'tis manifest, That he who is no Member of</hi> Christ, <hi>cannot have Christian Salvation. But the Members of</hi> Christ <hi>are joyn'd to each other by the Charity of Vnity, and by the same [Charity] do they cohere to their Head,</hi> Christ Jesus.</p>
            <p n="e">
               <hi>E.</hi> To separate from the Body of Christ is certainly Schism; but St. <hi>Austin</hi> in the same place tells us, that there is a Separation from the Head, as well as from the Body; that is, from Christ who is the Head, as well as from his Body, which is his Church. The first is a Schism occasioned by Heresy; the second is a causless Schism without any corruption in Faith and Worship. So that He never inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that, for fear of Schism, we should Communicate with a very Corrupt Church; but only warns us not to Separate from the Church of Christ, when such a Church does not Separate from Christ. But as far as any Church, or Society of Christians, Separates from Christ, the Head, so far we may and ought to Separate from them.</p>

                     <hi>Epist.</hi> 1 53.</note> how laudably so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he thinks himself to live, for this only Crime, that he is disjoyn'd from the Vnity of</hi> Christ, <hi>he shall not have life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi>

               <hi>F.</hi> As for the evil and danger of Schism, we perfectly agree with this Father; and will say as Ill things of it, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> her self can desire: But we are not afraid of these Ill Consequences of Schism, while we are no Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks.</p>
            <p n="g">G.

            <p n="g">
               <hi>G.</hi> THIS is all very true, and this was the Character of the Donatist Schism. They were charged with no Heresy, for they were Guilty of none; but only with Separating from the Communion of the Catholick Church, in Prayers, and Sacraments, which is a Separation; and if it be Causless, as it was in the Donatists, has the Guilt of Schism: But is a very just Separation, and no Schism, if it have a just Cause.</p>

If they do not, they are Innocent; if they say we do, let them prove it. We have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in our Worship that can hinder any Christian (not Roman-Catholicks them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves) from Communicating with us; and then, if they will not do it, it is their own Faults. We refuse Communion with no Church, with whom we can Communicate without Sin; and it is no Fault to refuse Communion, when it cannot be had without Sin. And therefore we are still <hi>in the Catholick Church,</hi> (and, I believe, the best Reformed part of the Catholick Church;) we are <hi>Members of Christ,</hi> have <hi>true Christian Charity</hi> (so much even for the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that it is made by themselves an Argument against us) and therefore doubt not to receive all the <hi>benefit of Sacraments</hi>; and, if we live holily, to receive the Fruits of it <hi>in eternal Salvation.</hi>

            <p n="i">I. <hi>And this Censure by so much the more justly belongs to them, as their Schism is more consumacious, their Calumnies against the Catholick Church more horrid, and their Defection by Heresie, as well as Schism, wider than the</hi> Donatists.</p>

Though had he known any thing of the Story of the Donatists, he would have known, That no Man can be more constant, and vertuously steddy, in a good Cause, than they were contumaciously Obstinate in a bad one. We do not <hi>calumniate the Catholick Church,</hi> God forbid! nay, not the Roman Church; for though we say a great many Ill things of them, they are True, and that is no Calumny. And are we the greater Schismaticks, because we justifie our Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by laying the Fault on the Corruptions and Innovations of the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> If the Donatists could have done so, St. <hi>Austin</hi> would not have thought them so much the worse Schismaticks, but no Schismaticks at all. And as for <hi>Heresy,</hi> when This Author can prove us guilty of that, we will allow our selves to be worse Schismaticks than the Donatists were.</p>
