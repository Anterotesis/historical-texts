            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN my PREFACE to the First Volume of this <hi>Hiſtorical Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of POLAND,</hi> I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd my Incapacity for Matters of this Nature; both becauſe I was only Twelve Months in that Kingdom, and becauſe I have no Talent, or Genius, for Hiſtory. I thought, Writing it by way of LET<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TERS, in Imitation of ſome of our Neighbours, would be more eaſie to my ſelf, and more acceptable to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. I am proud to have this happy Occaſion of giving the Honourable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons I write to ſo publick a Teſtimony of my Reſpects. I am ſorry in the ſame time, I cannot have Leiſure to honour my ſelf in writing to the Noble Perſons men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
<pb facs="tcp:52720:3"/>
in the Second Volume, as I have had in the First. I follow a Profeſſion ſo remote from HISTORY, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly a <hi>Poliſh</hi> one, that it neither allows me Time, nor leaves me any Inclination to attend any other Buſineſs. I hope notwithſtanding, the Perſons I promis'd to write to, will be pleas'd to excuſe me for not being able to keep my Word to them, as I flatter'd my ſelf I could, ſince the ingenious Gentleman I deſir'd to undertake this Work will give them the ſame Satisfaction, he having already aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted me in my First Volume, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had all my Memoirs for this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</p>

                  </note> Here, <hi>My Lord,</hi> I muſt take notice to Your GRACE, that the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Nation is divided into two ſorts of People, the Gentry or Freeborn Subjects, who are hardly a Tenth Part of the Kingdom, and the Vaſſals, who
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52720:5"/>
are no better than Slaves to the Gentry, for they have no Benefit of the Laws, can Buy no Eſtates, nor Enjoy any Property no more than our <hi>Negroes</hi> in the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> can and this becauſe ſome Ages ſince the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People Revolting againſt their Lords, and having driven them out of the Nation, the Gentry came with a Foreign Power, and reduced them to a greater Subjection than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in which they have been kept ever ſince. So that the Government of <hi>Poland</hi> at preſent comprehends only the King and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. By a Gentleman or Nobleman of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> is underſtood a Perſon who either him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or his Family, has a Poſſeſſion in Land: For they never Intermarry with the Common People. All the Gentry from the King's Sons to thoſe that are but only Maſters of an Acre of Land, are equally Noble, both by their Birth and the Conſtitution of the Kingdom; for no Body is Born either a Palatine, <hi>Senator,</hi> or Lord, but thoſe Titles are always annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to certain Employments, which the King only gives to Perſons advanced in Age, and recommended by their Merits.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Diet.</note> The <hi>Diet</hi> of <hi>Poland</hi> (in ſome reſpects) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles our Parliament, being made up of two Houſes; the Houſe of <hi>Senators,</hi> anſwerable to our Houſe of Lords; and the Houſe of <hi>Nuncio</hi>'s, not unlike our Houſe of Commons. The <hi>Senators</hi> are the Biſhops, <hi>Palatines, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellans,</hi> and the Ten Great Officers of the Crown, in all about 142. In the Upper-Houſe the <hi>Senators</hi> ſit not by any Writ of Summons or Letters Patents as in <hi>England,</hi> but only by Virtue of the Great Preferments in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52720:6"/>
the King's Gift, which they Enjoy for Life. So that the King wholly Conſtitutes the Upper Houſe; but the Lower are the Repreſentatives of the Gentry, Elected by them alone in their reſpective Provinces, without the Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Common People, who have no Priviledge to Vote in their Election. Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that at leaſt Nine Parts in Ten of the People of <hi>Poland</hi> are excluded from having any Share in the Government.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Its Power.</note> The Grand <hi>Diet</hi> of <hi>Poland</hi> is nothing elſe but the King, <hi>Senators,</hi> and Deputies aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled together in any Part of the Kingdom that his Majeſty Commands. Without this great Aſſembly of the <hi>States,</hi> the King can neither Make nor Repeal Laws, Declare War nor Conclude a Peace, make no Alliance with any Foreign Princes, raiſe neither Troops nor Taxes, Coin no Money; and, in a word, can Determine no Matter of State of any Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, without the Univerſal Conſent and Concurrence of this Parliament, which they term the <hi>Free States of</hi> Poland.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Motives for a mixt Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</note> Several powerful Motives have enclin'd the <hi>Poles</hi> to Eſtabliſh this kind of mixt Government, which they take to be a juſt Temperament of whatever is to be found moſt Excellent in the ſeveral Monarchies, <hi>Ariſtocracies,</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracies,</hi> that have been in the World. The moſt conſiderable of which Motives, as I have met with them in their Hiſtories, or learn'd them from the moſt knowing among their Natives, are as follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">A Motive.</note> Firſt, They think by this Judicious Choice of a Government, to preſerve their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from thoſe Diſorders which moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52720:6"/>
attend Abſolute Monarchies: Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing herein with that Prince of Philoſophers, <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> who though he preferr'd this kind of Government to all Others, yet was he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs obliged to own, that when ever it degenerated, it was the moſt pernicious of all.</p>
               <p>Thus the <hi>Poles</hi> have temper'd the Exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Power of their Kings, with the mixture of two other Governments, whereby they thought to ſecure their Liberty, a Thing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways moſt Dear to them, from the Arbitrary Will of a Prince, who by Imagining him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf above the Laws, might Fancy whatever his Paſſions prompted him to, allowable, and his trueſt Intereſt to be the Entire Subjection of his People. The miſerable Examples of their Neighbours, the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Moſcovites,</hi> have ſufficiently convinced them of this Truth; wherefore the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Nation thought it but convenient to limit the exceſſive Power of their Kings, and confine them to Rule with more Moderation and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">II. Motive.</note> Secondly, The <hi>Poles</hi> have obſerv'd as well from their own Government, as from that of their Neighbours, that no ſmall diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage has flow'd from an <hi>Ariſtocracy.</hi> They could not be perſwaded but that the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of one Perſon was infinitely more eaſie to be Tolerated than that of many; for that either the Ambition or Jealouſy of ſuch would often diſturb the Repoſe and Tranquility of the Public. <hi>Poland</hi> alſo began to Reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on its former Miſeries under its <hi>Woievods,</hi> when it was deplorably rent and torn by the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52720:7"/>
Factions among thoſe Palatines: Inſomuch that even while it became a Conqueror from without, it was vanquiſh'd within, and that by its own Force. This gave the <hi>Poles</hi> no ſmall diſlike to an <hi>Ariſtocracy,</hi> which they have reſolved never more to admit among them.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">III. Motive.</note> The Third Reaſon of State, which has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged the <hi>Poles</hi> to reject a <hi>Democracy,</hi> is, that they look upon that ſort of Government to be the moſt dangerous of all, being the eaſieſt enflam'd, and the greateſt Enemy to true Nobility. Its firſt <hi>Maxim</hi> is, <hi>To procure a <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Levelling, or making all alike;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, under the Notion of a common Liberty, they weaken and enervate thoſe great Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us's which were deſign'd to Govern and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect them. How then could it be expected that the Deſcendents of thoſe mighty War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers who Founded the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Nation, and have ſo long maintain'd the Honour of it by their Valour, ſhould ſubmit to have their Blood debaſed, by mixing it with the Ignoble Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar?</p>
               <p>The Tyranny of Laws, which the Nobles are ſubjected to in an Abſolute Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, would be too rude a Check to this Ambition which the <hi>Poles</hi> have always had to Command over their Vaſſals, and therefore they have always entertain'd a ſecret <hi>Odium</hi> for thoſe <hi>Grecian</hi> Republics, that Baniſh'd their greateſt Stateſmen, meerly becauſe they would not have them gain too faſt upon the Affections of the People.</p>
               <p>If any ſhould perhaps doubt of the perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Conſequences of a popular Government,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52720:7"/>
where Reaſon does not ſo much reign as an Unruly violence of a People, who know no other Laws than thoſe of their Paſſions; let them caſt their Eyes on the Heats of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire, who were often ready to Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the State, had not the Senate ſpeedily applied a prudent Remedy. But there are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Examples more Modern, as the Revolt of the <hi>Coſacks,</hi> and the laſt Troubles in <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia.</hi> To theſe alſo may be added the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions of our own Nation in the Time of <hi>Charles</hi> I. when the Fury of the People ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended their Rage, even to the dipping their Hands in this Prince's Blood.</p>
               <p>Politicians do generally own, that the People are a wild Beaſt, which ought rather to be led than left at Liberty, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence have pronounced it moſt Perilous to acquieſce under their Subjection. An <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy</hi> would undoubtedly do more harm in a day, than a Tyrant could in all his Reign. If he Puniſhes, 'tis with ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Juſtice, when nothing can abate the Peoples Rage, but an utter Extinction of whatever is placed over their He<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ds.</p>
               <p>A mixt Government therefore made out of all theſe Three, is that which has proved moſt <note place="margin">Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of a mixt Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</note>Agreeable to the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Nation, being a juſt <hi>Medium</hi> between the dangerous Extremities of an Abſolute Monarchy, and thoſe of <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy</hi> and <hi>Democracy.</hi> It is this the <hi>Poles</hi> have pitch'd upon as moſt proper to preſerve the public Liberty, and to perpetuate the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their State; being, it ſeems, perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that a Body Politic reſembles a Humane in this, that as the one borrows all its Vigour
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52720:8"/>
and Health from a Juſt Temperament of the different Humours that compoſe it; ſo the other depends abſolutely on that of the Three before-mention'd Forms of Government. And moreover, as the former ſubſiſts by the mutual Oppoſition of contrary Qualities, ſo the King, Senate and Gentry of <hi>Poland</hi> having in ſome meaſure different Intereſts and Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, are not only hinder'd from deviating into vicious Extremities, but alſo through a Noble Emulation are excited to labour care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully for the Good of the Public.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Diviſion of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic.</note> The Republic is divided into Two <hi>States,</hi> the Kingdom of <hi>Poland,</hi> and the Great Dutchy of <hi>Lithuania;</hi> yet both which are but as one Body, having the ſame King, the ſame Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, the ſame Laws, the ſame Privileges, the ſame Religion, and, as the natural reſult of all theſe, the ſame Intereſt. Theſe Two States are ſo very well United, that a King cannot be Elected, a Law made, nor any State-Buſineſs done, without the mutual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of both. But, <hi>My Lord,</hi> as the King is the Prime and Chief Member of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public, I will give Your <hi>GRACE</hi> an Account of his preſent Power and Prerogatives.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Kings pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Power and Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives.</note> The <hi>Poles</hi> are too proud a Nation to agree with thoſe Politicians that meaſure the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of a Prince, and Happineſs of a <hi>State,</hi> by the Deſpotic Power of him that Governs it; and therefore thoſe pernicious Maxims of Tyrants, <hi>Si Lubet, Licet; Oderint dum Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuant,</hi> and the like, would be but ill receiv'd among a People that have all along ſecured their Liberties by their Prudence and Valour.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52720:8"/>
This Vaſſalage would ſuit well enough with the Slaves of <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africk,</hi> or with the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> who all ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be govern'd like Beaſts, and led by the Noſe according to the different Caprice or Pleaſure of their Prince.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">His Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note> As for the Kings of <hi>Poland,</hi> they may reſt in ſecurity in the Boſom of their Country, even amidſt the Noiſe of Arms, either with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out or within their Dominions, ſince they have always their Subjects to crowd about them for their Guards, thro' indiſpenſable Inclinations. For what contributes chiefly to the Happineſs of theſe Princes, is, the Loyal Obſervance and voluntary Obedience paid them even by thoſe that are at Liberty to do the contrary. I have often heard Monſieur <hi>de Polignac,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador, ſay at <hi>Warſaw, That he thought a King of</hi> Poland <hi>more Happy in his Perſon and Condition, than a King of</hi> France. Nevertheleſs this Authority of the King of <hi>Poland</hi> is ſo alloy'd by the Laws of the Land, that it does not exact more Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from the Nobles or Gentry, than they think he deſerves: For tho' their Behaviour be generally extraordinary Obſervant, yet do they tacitly ſeem to call in queſtion the Power they have limited, and often refuſe that Duty which they have deem'd him wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of by his Election.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note> The <hi>Poliſh</hi> Nobility make no Difference between their King's Right, and thoſe of the <hi>Senate</hi> and <hi>Deputies,</hi> affirming, That ſince theſe three Members compoſe but one Body, they ought equally to ſhare in the ſame Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits and Injuries, and conſequently ought all
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52720:9"/>
either to Reward the one, or Revenge the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">A great Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the State.</note> The ſmall Authority therefore of their Kings, and the Impoſſibility of their Acting by themſelves, has at all times expoſed <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to the Inſults of their Neighbours, and the Rage of their own People, as may be ſeen in the Civil Wars of the <hi>Coſacks,</hi> and the Treachery and Sedition of the Confederates which could never have arriv'd at ſo great height, if the King had had but ſufficient Power to have ſuppreſs'd them. Alſo the Great Marſhal of the Crown <hi>Lubomirski,</hi> would never have had the Boldneſs to have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd King <hi>Caſimir</hi>'s Deſigns openly, and to have form'd ſo many Factions againſt the Court, had he not had ſome Aſſurances of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Unpuniſh'd. This makes the King of <hi>Poland</hi> to be ſtiled a King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, ſince he has no better than Companions and Equals for his Subjects.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Inſtances of <hi>Poles</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to their Kings.</note> We have divers Inſtances of the <hi>Poles</hi> love for their Kings, and particularly by their once enforcing the Right of <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> III. to the Kingdom of <hi>Sweden,</hi> in an obſtinate War which they began ſeveral times, as likewiſe in ſupporting afterwards the Pretences of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſlaus</hi> VII. to <hi>Moſcovy:</hi> To omit divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of a more ancient Date. This Reſpect of their obliges them frequently to come and ſpend their Eſtates at Court, thinking to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment their Princes Grandeur by their Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality and Magnificence. This appears by the miſtake made by <hi>Gregory</hi> King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> at the Interview between him and <hi>Caſimir</hi> the Great, at <hi>Glogan,</hi> (which Place the former
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52720:9"/>
had demanded to bound the Limits of <hi>Sileſia)</hi> when he ſaluted a Private Gentleman, ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly Cloath'd, for the King of <hi>Poland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Modern Kings Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</note> The Cuſtom and Inclination of the <hi>Poles</hi> runs ſo ſtrong towards Honouring their Prince, that all they have, or are able to do, even to the Deſtruction of their Lives and Fortunes, they are willing to laviſh in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, without expecting any greater Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence than the Glory of Waiting on His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Perſon. Inſomuch, that a King of <hi>Poland</hi> who is Couragious and Prudent, Juſt and Sober, Liberal and Religious; one that obſerves the Laws and Conſtitutions of his Kingdom, and in a word, who has no other Intereſt but the Common Good and Safety of his Subjects, is as much Reſpected and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd, and as faithfully Obey'd both in time of Peace and War; nay, as formidable to all his Enemies as moſt Princes in <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to what relates to War, no Monarch has greater Advantages than himſelf; for he is neither at the trouble of raiſing Forces nor Expence in Maintaining them; his Buſineſs being only to convene the <hi>Diet,</hi> and they do all theſe things to his Hand. After War is once declar'd, he can continue the ſame, either by himſelf or his Generals, can Regulate his Troops, and ſee his Army duly paid out of the Treaſury of the Republic. He has a great deal of reaſon to hope for Succeſs in his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditions, becauſe that not having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken them on his own account, thoſe that engag'd him to them will infallibly ſupport him in them, and the rather, by reaſon that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52720:10"/>
what was done was altogether with their Conſent. This has prov'd the Cauſe of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt neverfailing Succeſs to the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Arms till of late Days, the King and his Subjects not having been in ſo good Intelligence with each other as formerly.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Abroad and at Home.</note> When the King is in the Army in Perſon, he has the Supreme Authority there, gives Battle when he pleaſes, and Beſieges Towns as often as he thinks fit: And likewiſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands abſolutely all the Gentry to follow him into the Field on Horſeback at ever ſo little warning. At Home he has the free Nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all Eccleſiaſtical Benefices, and of all Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Employments, as well Military as Civil throughout the whole Extent of his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; without ſpeaking of a great number of Royal <hi>Demeſnes,</hi> which together with the State-Dignities he confers on thoſe that have deſerv'd them. He can beſtow as conſiderable Preferments as any Prince in <hi>Europe,</hi> and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige and raiſe the Fortune of whom he pleaſes. He has his Vote in Naming Cardinals, as well as other Roman Catholic Kings have. He can ſend and receive Ambaſſadors pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately in Matters relating only to himſelf, but as to what concerns the Republic the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate muſt have their Share in it. He can Call, Prorogue, and Diſſolve the <hi>Diet</hi> at Pleaſure. In a word, the <hi>Poles</hi> term him, <hi>The Protector of their Laws and Privileges; The Diſtributor of Honours; The Supream Head of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public; and Supream General of their Forces.</hi>

               <p>Before, <hi>My Lord,</hi> I put an end to this Letter, permit me to take notice to Your <hi>GRACE,</hi> that the King of <hi>Poland</hi> does not Name his Privy-Counſellors, but all <hi>Senators</hi> are Counſellors of Courſe; for all of that Dignity that are about the Place where the King Reſides, have a Right to ſit at the Council-Board.

altho they have no actual Voices in the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for their great Number can eaſily favour and carry on a Faction, by threatning the Senators and Deputies, in Caſe they do not elect ſuch a Prince as they propoſe.

                  <note place="margin">Rules ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd by the <hi>Poles</hi> in Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> The Gentry of <hi>Poland</hi> think themſelves ſo great, and ſo equal in Reſpect to each other, that they do not willingly conſent to elect a <hi>Piaſto</hi> or Native to a Crown, which their Birth gave them a parallel Right to. They beſides think it a great Advantage to their Nation to chooſe a forreign and rich Prince, that they may make more Alliances abroad, and oblige ſuch Kings to bring all their Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects with them to enrich the Kingdom. They are for an unmarry'd Prince, that they may have the Opportunity of matching him, and ſo to ſtrengthen their Alliances that Way. They care not to elect a neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Prince, for fear he ſhould become abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute by his adjoyning Force. But however theſe, like their other Conſtitutions, have not been always obſerv'd; for the only Maxim they have hitherto kept inviolable, is not to elect any Prince but a <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick, for the late King was both a <hi>Piaſto</hi> and marry'd before he was elected: 'Tis true, they would have had his Queen divorc'd from him, that they might have marry'd him to King <hi>Micha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi>'s Queen Dowager <hi>Eleonora,</hi> at preſent Dutcheſs Dowager of <hi>Lorrain;</hi> but the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection

the King always bore to his Queen, in Conjunction with her own Intrigues among the <hi>Senators,</hi> ſoon broke this Deſign.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Why pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their Kingdom elective.</note> The others are, firſt, That they take that Government to be eaſieſt, which is executed by a Perſon whom they have unanimouſly choſen to obey, being not thereby oblig'd to be ſubject to a Prince that Nature only has ſet over their Heads. Secondly, That they eſteem an elective Kingdom free from thoſe Hazzards which one that is ſucceſſive moſt
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:52720:77"/>
commonly incurs during the Minority of its Princes, for that then either its Neigbours take an Occaſion to invade it, or its Great Men to embroil it, the better to ſecure the greater Share in the Government to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, under ſo weak a Head. If this be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be remedy'd by aſſigning fit Tutors and Counſellors to the young Prince; They ſay, that the Government will be miſerably miſtaken, for that we do not want in Hiſtory ſeveral Examples of young Kings, who have been driven out of their Thrones by their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd Governours: And moreover, that ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom any Kingdom has been known to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue long in Peace, during the Minority of its King. The third Reaſon they give is, that in an elective State, rarely any Blood is ſhed about the Succeſſion, as has frequently hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd in other Countries, without fetching any Examples from Antiquity. Fourthly, They ſay, that a King choſen by the free Conſent of the People, will be likely, in common Gratitude, to retaliate the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the Clemency and Juſtice of his Reign. The fifth Advantage which the <hi>Poles</hi> pretend by an Election of their Kings is, that in no other State Princes take ſo great Care to educate their Children, as in theirs. And the ſixth is, That by Means of electing their King, the Gentry (who are only conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd in <hi>Poland)</hi> have the greater Power of conſerving their Liberties and Privileges, in which their greateſt Happineſs conſiſts. And the ſeventh is, by limiting the Actions of their Kings to the unanimous Conſent of the <hi>Diet.</hi> I might here mention many more

                  <note place="margin">Their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> The Condition of the <hi>Kmetons</hi> (as the <hi>Poles</hi> call them) or Boors, or Ruſticks, at this Day in <hi>Poland</hi> is ſuch, that they lead mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable and wretched Lives, haviug no Laws, no Judges, and ſcarce any Religion among them; but like Brutes, they are forc'd to Work on Sundays, and dare not ſo much as Appeal to the King or <hi>Diet</hi> for Redreſs. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, in Royal <hi>Pruſſia</hi> their Condition is ſomething better; for there they enjoy al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the ſame Laws and Liberties with the Gentry. Formerly <hi>Caſimir</hi> the Great made ſeveral Laws in their behalf; but which at this day are ſeldom or never practis'd. All Biſhops, Abbots, <hi>Palatins, Caſtellans,</hi> &amp;c. are oblig'd to be of the <hi>Nobleſs,</hi> except a certain Number aſſign'd by King <hi>John Albert</hi> out of the <hi>Plebeians,</hi> to be capable of being inferiour Divines, Lawyers or Phyſicians only. An Exception from this Law may be ſeen in the Perſon of <hi>Peter Gamratus,</hi> who from a <hi>Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beian</hi> was prefer'd by <hi>Sigiſmund,</hi> to ſeveral both Eccleſiaſtical and Temporal Dignities: But in <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> as I have remark'd before, the Cuſtoms are much more indulgent to the Common People.</p>

and Cuſtoms of theſe poor Wretches; And it may firſt be remark'd, That theſe Slaves can enjoy nothing of their own, nor ever become Free, unleſs they can get into ſome Convent, or get to be Ordain'd Prieſts, or elſe incline their Maſters to Debauch their Wives or Daughters, whereby the Law ſets them Free: But moſt commonly their Lords have a watchful Eye over them, and obviate all their Policies.</p>

Their Puniſhments are ſometimes ſeveral Blows of a Cudgel, and ſometimes a kind of Pillory, wherein thoſe Wretches ſhall be ſometimes ſet for a whole Day together. I ſhould think now, theſe poor Wretches the moſt miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Creatures Breathing; but they on the contrary, never having known any better Condition; and having ſeen their Fathers Slaves before them, are well ſatisfied and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with their Servitude.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Their Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners at Bed and Board.</note> They have generally three or four ſorts at a Meal, <hi>viz.</hi> One of Peaſe, with a little Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con ſlic'd among it. Another of Courſe Wheat, Barley, or Millet, whereof they make their <hi>Cachat;</hi> and two others of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſorts of ſtrengthening Roots; whereof they have great Plenty, and very good. The Movables of theſe Peaſants Cottages are only a few Earthen or Wooden Diſhes, and a hard Bed, which they make themſelves, with a very wretched Coverlet. Their Children are not ſuffer'd to have a Bed till they are Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd; but are forc'd to lye upon Boards by the Hearth ſide. Theſe ſort of Hearths have no Chimneys; and the Smoak has only a little Hole to get out at the Top of the Houſe.
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:52720:99"/>
In <hi>Poland</hi> it is impoſſible to ſubſiſt a Nights without theſe Hearths; and therefore not only the Peaſants, but Gentry likewiſe, are oblig'd to have them; though the laſt are of different Make and Materials from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>

                  </note> Now I ſhall proceed to inform your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip how Nobility is acquir'd in <hi>Poland,</hi> which is firſt by Birth, where both the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents were Noble: Nevertheleſs now a-days, by a long Tract of Cuſtom, not only ſuch are reputed Noble, but likewiſe thoſe whoſe Mothers were Plebeians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for nothing is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent more practis'd in <hi>Poland</hi> than for the Gentry to match with the Commonalty, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially with thoſe that are rich. Secondly, Nobility is acquir'd by Creation, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly was wholly at the King's. Pleaſure, but of latter Days is only at the Diſpoſal of the <hi>Senate</hi> or <hi>Diet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Creation of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</note> The Manner of making a Gentleman is this. The King not being ſole ſufficient for that Purpoſe, he is oblig'd to ſend to all the little <hi>Diets</hi> of the Kingdom for their Conſent, which afterwards alſo muſt be approv'd by the Great <hi>Diet,</hi> and then a Gentleman may have his <hi>Diploma,</hi> and be enroll'd. All this Ceremony, and a great deal more goes to the making of a Gentleman in <hi>Poland.</hi> A <hi>Jew</hi> is made a Gentleman, firſt by becoming a Chriſtian, and then by ſignalizing himſelf in the Wars, when he is propos'd by the King to the little <hi>Diets,</hi> and afterwards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd by the great one. It may be here ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd that 'tis better to be born than crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Noble, for theſe laſt (call'd by the <hi>Poles</hi>

                  <note place="margin">A third way of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> There is a third way of becoming Noble, which is by ſerving as Magiſtrate in ſome pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileg'd City, particularly in <hi>Cracow</hi> and <hi>Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> where the <hi>Conſuls</hi> or <hi>Senators</hi> are quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd to tranſmit their Privileges to their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Three ways of forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</note> Alſo as Nobility is to be gain'd, ſo likewiſe it may be forfeited three Ways: Firſt, by ſome heinous Crime: For Example, where a Nobleman permits one that is Ignoble to uſurp his Coat of Arms. Secondly, by exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing any Trade or Merchandizing, or any ſordid Calling in any City or Town; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he immediately forfeits his Privileges and Quality. And thirdly, by being a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate in any City not Privileg'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">In what Caſe reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r'd.</note> However, tho' Nobility may by theſe Means be loſt and forfeited, yet many have been known to be reſtor'd where their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents had quitted their Quality thro' Poverty, the <hi>Poles</hi> juſtly conſidering the Force of that Condition, which is able to drive Men to the moſt Ignoble Actions.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Chracter of the <hi>Poles.</hi>
                  </note> To give your Lordſhip a Character of the <hi>Poles,</hi> I may affirm that they exceed all the Nations of <hi>Europe</hi> in Vivacity of Spirit, Strength of Body, and living long, which cannot be occaſion'd by their Climate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Swedes, Moſcovites,</hi> and <hi>Germans</hi> live
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:52720:101"/>
all under the ſame Parallel, and yet enjoy not the like Vigour and Health, and therefore muſt proceed,</p>
               <p>Firſt, From their Diet, which as to Meat is generally freſh roaſted Fleſh (for they ſcarce ever eat any boyl'd or ſalt) and Fowl, which encreaſes the volatile and fix'd Salts, and thence comes their Vigour and Vivacity.</p>
               <p>Secondly, From their Drink, which is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and ſtrong, being chiefly <hi>Hungarian</hi> Wine burnt, or Aniſeed Water, both which they guzzle down in great Quantities almoſt all the Day long. The poorer Sort have a Liquor diſtill'd from Wheat, Oats, or Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, which the Gentry rectifie with Anniſeeds or Aromaticks.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, From their living hardily, for they hate Effeminacy, and a poor Country Cottage pleaſes them as well as a Palace, and they frequently weave Tapiſtry and Arras, as they travel along upon the Roads.</p>
               <p>Nay, many of them will ſleep in Time of Froſt and Snow without any Bed or other Conveniency, and the little Children, two Months after they are born, have been ſeen carry'd about ſtark naked.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, from hunting, which is very much in Uſe among them, and particularly of a wild Beaſt which they call <hi>Zubra,</hi> having no cloven Feet. They eat theſe Animals, which they find only in <hi>Lithuania.</hi> The <hi>Poles</hi> are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly addicted to, and expert in Horſeman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which might probably occaſion the Arms of <hi>Lithuania.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:52720:101"/>
Fifthly, From other Exerciſes, for the <hi>Poles</hi> are very much enclin'd to Dancing, Leaping, Vaulting, Jumping, &amp;c. as likewiſe exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly given to Talking and Converſation, wherein they agree with the <hi>French.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, Their Beds, Faſting, and Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in Eating, very much contribute towards their living long; for hard Beds knit their Bones, and Temperance refines their Spirits. The Slaves among them have no Beds, and the Maſters ſeldom uſe any but Quilts, and the like.</p>
               <p>And ſeventhly, Their Health, Vigour, and Vivacity may reaſonably be augmented by their great Freedom and Privileges; for where Slavery hebetates and blunts the Mind, and conſequently enervates the Body, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty exhilerates the one, and by that means ſtrengthens the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c.</note> The Complexion of the <hi>Poles</hi> is generally enclining to fair, as likewiſe their Hair to a pale Yellowiſh Colour. Their Stature is commonly of the middle Sort, tho' a little tending to the talleſt. Their Conſtitutions are generally good, and their Bodies groſs, yet the Women of Quality make it their chief Study to make themſelves lean and ſlim: But Painting and Waſhes to meliorate their Complexions they abhor, neither have they any Occaſion for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Manners of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Men.</note> The <hi>Poliſh</hi> Men cut their Hair about their Ears like Monks, as I obſerv'd in the firſt Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of this Hiſtory. They raze away all the Hair from their Faces, leaving only one large
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:52720:102"/>
Whisker. They walk gravely with a Poll-Ax in their Hands, and a Sabre by their Sides, which they never put off but when they go to Bed. This Sabre hangs by a Strap of Leather, to which is alſo faſtened a Hankercheif, a Knife and Sheath, and a ſmall Stone ſet in Silver to whet their Knife upon. They waſh their Faces and Necks eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Morning in cold-Water, and the Fathers are accuſtom'd to make their Children to waſh themſelves as ſoon as they are ſtirring, even in the ſharpeſt Weather.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Their fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</note> The <hi>Poles</hi> are generally open-hearted and honeſt (as <hi>Boterus</hi> obſerves in his Relations) more apt to be deceiv'd than to deceive, and not ſo eaſily provok'd as appeas'd. They are likewiſe for the moſt part very dutiful to their Magiſtrates, and courteous and hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Strangers, which laſt they will not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly invite to their Houſes and freely converſe with, but alſo endeavour to imitate. I have known ſome (ſays <hi>Hauteville)</hi> that have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd <hi>French Men, Italians,</hi> and <hi>Germans</hi> whom they did not know, meerly becauſe they were out of Employment.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Education and Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</note> From their greeneſt Years they apply themſelves to Letters, yet which generally ſpeaking, ſeldom extends much beyond a perfect Knowledge of the Latin and their own Language, altho they have not however all along wanted for famous Mathematicians, Hiſtorians, Orators, Philoſophers, and Poets; as likewiſe for learned Phyſicians, Lawyers, and Divines; ſome of which have illuſtrated
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:52720:102"/>
both the Church and their Native Country with their Writings. And doubtleſs the Learned would have been oblig'd to more of their Nation had not their Works periſh'd for Want of Printing, which Art has been but lately receiv'd among them. Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip will find no People with whom you may more generally converſe in Latin, and where all Records are written in that Language: The Women alſo learn Latin in the Nunne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">To what generaly apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</note> The Adult among the Plebeians generally addict themſelves, the Men to Trade or Agriculture, and the Women to good Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifry. The Gentry alſo apply themſelves to ſerve the Church or State. Yet both Gentry and Commonalty are often given to Travel, and eaſily imbibe the Idioms of foreign Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Their Parts are ſprightly and active, yet nevertheleſs more apt for Imitation than Invention. Formerly the <hi>Poles</hi> were not much given to Trafick, but now, by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of their Neighbours who came to trade among them, they ſtrive to outvy each other in Riches and Covetouſneſs; yet for the moſt part they love to make a Show, and will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear very ſplendid upon the leaſt Occaſions.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Worſt part of their Character.</note> For the worſt Part of their Character we muſt obſerve with <hi>Barclay,</hi> that they run mad after Liberty, and rather drive than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite their Kings to obſerve their Laws. They not only hate the Name of Slavery, but likewiſe abhor a juſt and hereditary Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy. The Gentry claim prerogatives that
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:52720:103"/>
will ſcarce give them Leave to be guilty of any Crime, and whenever they happen to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge any ſuch, the Prince has ſeldom a Power to puniſh it. They are not only li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious in their Morals and a civil Life, but likewiſe in Religion and ſacred Obſervances, for without Fear of Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures, they will both talk and act as they pleaſe againſt that Function, affirming themſelves ſelf-ſufficient to be their own Guides in thoſe Matters.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Genius how enclin'd.</note> Their Genius enclines them generally to Arms, tho' they fall far ſhort of their ancient Glory, by reaſon there are now ſo few pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſpirited Perſons among them, each ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving greater Regard to his own private Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and Gain, than either the Honour or Safety of his Country. Nevertheleſs not all have been of this Character, for ſeveral of latter Days have approv'd themſelves worthy Patriots, and couragious Defenders of the Republick, and for the moſt part they are ſtill good Soldiers, providing there appears any Money or other Reward to puſh them on.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Enur'd to Hardſhip.</note> It is probable they would be almoſt invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible were they but well Diſciplin'd, for they are ſo inur'd to Hardſhip, that they look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on even the <hi>Germans</hi> to be an Effeminate Sort of People, not fitting to ſupport the Fatigues of War, and the Rigour of Weather. The <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army has been known to lie encamp'd in the Snow, which it did in the Year 1663. for King <hi>Caſimir</hi> ſet forth from <hi>Leopol</hi> in the Beginning of <hi>September,</hi> and did not return
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:52720:103"/>
from the Frontiers of <hi>Moſcovy</hi> till the Spring of the Year following.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Greedy of Money.</note> The <hi>Poles</hi> are ſo very greedy of Money, that there is ſcarce any thing they will refuſe to obtain it; but when they have once got it, tho they borrow it, they never think of Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Reſtitution; nay, they will laugh at ſuch as demand it of them, bidding them go uſe the ſame Means as they did to get it: This one would think ſhould altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt Commerce and Trade; therefore it would not be here amiſs to inform your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip how they Lend and Borrow in <hi>Poland.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Manner of Lending and Borow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> It muſt firſt be obſerv'd that Bonds and Obligations are of no Uſe there, for when the Gentlemen borrow of one another, they mortgage their Lands or Villages, and when they borrow of the Tradeſmen or Merchants, they always leave Pledges, and beſides pay 14 <hi>per Cent.</hi> which is allow'd by the Laws of the Land. But providing the Summ ſo bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd be not paid within a Time preſcrib'd, then is the Creditor at Liberty to diſpoſe of the Pledge without any Account to be given.</p>

Afterwards when they were engag'd againſt the <hi>Turks</hi> in <hi>Valachia,</hi> they chang'd their Faſhions to the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> and <hi>Tartarian</hi> Habits: And after that to the <hi>Suediſh</hi> and <hi>German</hi> Modes, when they were in War with the <hi>Suedes</hi> in <hi>Pruſſia.</hi>

They have 'tis true, ſome white Rabbets which they breed tame for the Sake of their Furrs. In <hi>Poland</hi> there are a great many Roe-bucks, but few Stags: Abundance of wild Boars, Hogs, Poultry, Pigeons, and the like: But as for wild-Foul, they have great Store in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in Summer, but none in Winter, as in other Countries, when they are beſt.

                  <note place="margin">Manners in Husbandry.</note> It may be obſerv'd, that theſe People plow, ſow, and harrow, all at the ſame Time, and that their Ground having been but once fecundated with burning, will bear great Crops ſeven or eight Years together without dunging. When they burn the Woods on the Lands, if they meet with high Trees, they do not cut them down, but only prune off their ſide Branches, ſo that the Sun may not be kept from the Ground, the manner of doing which is uncommon, for one Peaſant will prune above a thouſand Trees together without ſo much as once coming down.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Strange way of Pruning Trees.</note> To effect this, he provides himſelf of a Seat of Rope, much like a Stirrup, the which he faſtens to a long Cord, and having caſt it over an Arm of the Tree, a Boy that is on the Ground draws him up and down, and when he has ſo done, by Help of another Cord, eaſily transfers him to the next Tree. This Peaſant has always a Hook by his Side, with which he uſes to lop off the Branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.</p>

one Harveſt, and the VVheat reap'd the next. This VVheat being trod down by thoſe that mow the Barley, the next Harveſt commonly comes up ſo thick and high, that there is ſcarce any paſſing thro' it for Fear of being ſtifled.</p>

I might obſerve ſeveral other prodigious Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations out of the aforeſaid Author, but for brevity ſake I omit them; only I may affirm with <hi>Boterus,</hi> in his Deſcription of <hi>Poland,</hi> that in caſe of neceſſity the <hi>Poles</hi> can raiſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of 100000 Horſe, and the <hi>Lithuanians</hi> 70000: But <hi>Starovolſcius</hi> is of Opinion, they can both raiſe above 200000 Horſe without Expenſe.

               <p>The number of <hi>Poliſh</hi> Foot is uncertain, they being at Liberty to appear, or to be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for Money. <hi>Starovolſcius</hi> ſays, that in his time they did not amount to many hundreds, being diſcouraged by the rigour of their <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſta</hi>'s, and wholly confin'd to their ruſtick Drudgery, tho' (continues he) they are more able to ſuſtain the hardſhips of War, then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Germans</hi> or <hi>Hungarians,</hi> who can ſcarce live in the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Air. He alſo is of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Infantry, if encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, might amount to a conſiderable number, and be not a little ſerviceable.

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52720:128"/>
fought alſo on Horſeback, and King <hi>Stephen</hi> in his Expedition againſt the <hi>Suedes</hi> in <hi>Livonia,</hi> had above 16000 <hi>German</hi> and <hi>Hungarian</hi> Foot in his Pay.</p>

When a <hi>Poſpolite</hi> is once agreed by the General <hi>Diet</hi> to be ſummon'd, the King, after the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent manner, ſends out his Writs, or Letters into all the <hi>Palatinates</hi> or <hi>Diſtricts</hi> of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which being received by the inferiour Officers, they are faſtned by a ſmall Cord to a long Pole (whence they are called <hi>Literae Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtium</hi> by ſome, and by others <hi>VVici,</hi> ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Poliſh,</hi> a Staff) and carried aloſt to every one of the Chief Noblemen of the <hi>Diſtrict</hi> thrice in a Month, and Proclaim'd as often in all Cities and Towns. All Courts of Juſtice ceaſe at the third reading of theſe Letters, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be thoſe of the Vice-<hi>Staroſta</hi>'s, who exerciſe their Juriſdiction as before. After the laſt reading of theſe Letters, a Place is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by ſeveral private Aſſemblies of the Nobility in every <hi>District,</hi> for particular Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and afterwards for the General Muſter of every <hi>Palatinate.</hi> Here the <hi>Palatins</hi> and <hi>Caſtellans</hi> take an exact Account of the Men, Horſes, Arms, &amp;c. neither of which can be chang'd after that Muſter. At the ſame time alſo, the <hi>Palatin</hi> divides the <hi>Diſtricts</hi> among the ſeveral <hi>Caſtellans,</hi> and orders them their ſeveral Poſts. In thoſe <hi>Palatinates</hi> where there is but one <hi>Caſtellan,</hi> there part of his Duty is performed by a Vice-Chamberlain, &amp;c. and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52720:128"/>
in <hi>Lithuania</hi> by a Marſhal of every <hi>Diſtrict.</hi> This particular Muſter being over, the <hi>Caſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi> of every <hi>Diſtrict</hi> leads the Gentry under<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his Command to the place of general Muſter for the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> where the <hi>Palatin</hi> Muſters them again, and takes an account of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faulters. Before the <hi>Caſtellans</hi> come to the <hi>Palatins,</hi> Juſtice is abſolutely in their Hands, but afterwards they muſt reſign it to the <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,</hi> tho' Capital Crimes are always reſerved for the determination of the General, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the King, who of late days has had a Council of War Aſſign'd him for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p>I may here obſerve, that the Gentry are always Muſter'd and Regiſtr'd annually by their reſpective Officers. <hi>Starovolſcius</hi> reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly <note place="margin">Things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in vain of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry.</note>requires two neceſſary Qualities in the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Horſe, which they ſeldom or never have, and thoſe are <hi>Expedition</hi> and <hi>Obedience.</hi> As to the former, he ſays, they are always unwilling to leave their Wives and Children, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore never care for appearing, before they are forced by the third Summons: And as for the latter, when they are got together, he ſays, thinking themſelves Powerful, they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Plotting, and ready to Rebel againſt their Superiours; and the reaſon is, that altho' the Kingdom of <hi>Poland</hi> abounds with all manner of Plenty, yet in every Expedition almoſt, the Soldiers are ready to ſtarve, which is occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by a ſhameful neglect of the Chief Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers to furniſh the Army with requiſite Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, whence it often comes to paſs, that tho' matters are brought to the neareſt iſſue, yet they are generally forſaken before they are
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52720:129"/>
accompliſhed, the Soldiers Heads running af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter nothing but Forrage and Plunder, which they take wherever it comes in their way, whereby the Country is generally injur'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being righted and defended.

                  <note place="margin">Meet at the General Rendezvous</note> When the Gentry have been thus Muſter'd by the <hi>Palatins,</hi> they are next to be led by their Officers to the Place of general Rendezvous, where every <hi>Palatin</hi> delivers up his Charge to the Supremacy of the Great General. In their March they are not to be quarter'd upon any of the King's or Gentrys Eſtates, but are to encamp in the open Fields, that they may make no diſturbance in the Citys. At this day the Generals Power is very much limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in reſpect of what it was formerly, for then a General was altogether Abſolute, and his Will alone went for a Law, but now he can do little without the conſent of ſuch as the Republick has Aſſign'd him. Beſides the Great Generals, and Field-Marſhals, the King, by the Laws, is obliged to be in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in Perſon. This appears by the example of King <hi>Alexander,</hi> who, by reaſon the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try demanded his Preſence among them, tho' Sick, was forced to be carried in a Litter into the Camp.

Another inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience proceeds from the ill Conduct and Remiſsneſs of the under Officers, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt whereof is that, eſpecially thoſe of the Gentry, ſeldom come to the place of Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvouz, till a Month or ſix Weeks after the time appointed, and this neither the King nor General dares offer to remedy, for fear of diſobliging that ſerviceable Body. In like manner the Gentry are ſometimes accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom'd to leave the Army a Month before the Campaign is ended, which grievance is alſo not to be redreſs'd without danger. The cauſe of their being ſo tardy in appearing, is in a great meaſure to be Attributed to the defective Orders given them; for when the Officers are Commanded to March to ſuch or ſuch a place in the Kingdom, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52720:136"/>
the time they are to march in, nor the Towns they are to paſs through, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, ſo that by theſe means they are at liberty, to delay on account of their own private Buſineſs, as much as they pleaſe, or elſe, to wander all over the Kingdom, either for their Profit or Pleaſure; whereby the Country they March through is not a little damag'd, and the beſt laid Deſigns of the Army fruſtrated by their Abſence. Another Inconvenience ariſing from the Officers, is, That they employ ſo much Money in fitting themſelves out with coſtly Arms, and ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Equipage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that for want of timely Pay, they have ſeldom any thing left, in a little time, to ſupport their Neceſſities: Which De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect they are wont to make up, by oppreſſing the People after an unreaſonable manner. From this Extravagance of theirs, proceeds another Inconvenience to the State; For, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they have thus exhauſted their Pockets, they uſually lay the Occaſion of their Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>behaviour either on the Court, or the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which, in the ſucceeding <hi>Diet,</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes produces great Heats and Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances. When any new Levies are to be made in <hi>Poland,</hi> the Officers not only excuſe, for Money, what Places they think ſit; but alſo, as I obſerv'd before, ſeldom pay the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers the Rates that they are allow'd for them; ſo that theſe latter are, in a manner, forc'd to pillage and plunder even their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, without their Officers being able to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, by reaſon that they have firſt ſet them Examples for ſo doing.</p>

another General, <hi>Boratinius,</hi> with 2000 Horſe, defeated 30000 <hi>Moſcovites,</hi> killing 7000 of them, and bringing away all their Cannon.

               <p>TRADE has ever been juſtly eſteem'd ſo neceſſary towards the Support and Grandeur of any <hi>State,</hi> that no Nation in the World has hitherto been found ſo Stupid, as to be without it. Some Countries indeed, have wholly confin'd it to the limits of their own Dominions, but how much they have been in the wrong, may appear from the vaſt advantages which Foreign Commerce has brought to other Nations. <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> are ſufficient Demonſtrations of this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, who, during the late War, have been thereby able to contribute ſo largely towards the oppoſing a Potent Monarch, who other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe might have been ſo far from affording
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52720:142"/>
ſuch wonderful Conceſſions, as we have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd by the late happy Peace, that he might rather, in all Probability, have over-run the greateſt part of <hi>Europe.</hi>

                     <hi>Poles</hi> not much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to Trade, and why.</note> As for the Trade of <hi>Poland,</hi> my <hi>Lord,</hi> the <hi>Poles</hi> are but little addicted to induſtry of that kind, the Gentry being abſolutely forbid it on the forfeiture of their Honour, and the Commonalty for the moſt part wanting Funds ſufficient to promote it; therefore, what Trade they have is chiefly follow'd by Foreign Merchants. Beſides, thoſe of the <hi>Poles,</hi> who have the beſt Fortunes, generally ſpend too much of their Revenues in coſtly Habits and Luxury to be able to undergo any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble matters in Traffick. Alſo this Kingdom of <hi>Poland</hi> is not in the leaſt commodious for ſuch an undertaking, it not having any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Port, that of <hi>Dantzic</hi> only excepted, which would ſuffice for the exotick Trade of ſo vaſt a Country. Hence it follows, that what Commodities are tranſported into Foreign Countries are ſo very inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, that tho' they are of ſeveral ſorts, and of general uſe, yet being counterpois'd by the incredible quantity, and richer variety of foreign Merchandize, they ſcarce ſuffice for Balance to the Cloth, Silk, Jewels, Tapeſtry, Fruit, Spice, Salt-Fiſh, Wine, Tin, Steel, &amp;c. Imported from <hi>England, Flanders, Portugal, Spain,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <hi>Starovolſcius</hi> enumerates the divers particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars Exported and Imported, wherein it may not be improper to follow him. He ſays, that over and above thoſe already mentioned,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52720:143"/>
there are likewiſe rich Furrs, Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, both wrought and unwrought, and great variety of Kickſhaws and Delicacies Import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and as for what are Exported, they are Wheat, Barley, Oats, Rie, Millet, and all ſorts of Grain and Pulſe, Wooll, Hemp, Flax, Hops, a ſort of Herb for Dying, Hides, Tallow, Tann'd Leather, Furrs brought out of <hi>Muſao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,</hi> but dreſt here, and tranſported from hence. Likewiſe <hi>Poliſh</hi> Furrs, Honey, Wax, Amber, Pitch, Pot-aſhes, Maſts, Planks, and ſeveral Materials both for Shipwrights and other Builders. <hi>Poland</hi> alſo exports, Salt, Beer, Opium, Vitriol, Nitre, <hi>Lapis Lazuli,</hi> Vermil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, Braſs, Lead, Iron, Copper, Pit-Coal, Glaſs, and Earthen Ware. Moreover it ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the Neighbouring Countries with Horſes very much coveted for their ſwiftneſs, hardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and eaſy pace. It alſo furniſhes other Nations with vaſt numbers of Oxen, Sheep, Hogs, &amp;c. with which it greatly abounds.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">But little Money, and why.</note> Notwithſtanding all theſe Exportations, yet as I ſaid before, the Trade of <hi>Poland</hi> is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balanc'd by Foreign Commodities, whence it comes to paſs, that there is but little Money to be met with in that Kingdom. What ſmall matters the Merchants receive for their Goods at <hi>Dantzic,</hi> they generally give to the <hi>Hungarians,</hi> &amp;c. for Wine; nevertheleſs, they have ſome Foreign Coin, and ſome of their own ſtirring amongſt them.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Coin moſt current in <hi>Poland.</hi>
                  </note> That which is moſt current in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, is either all of Copper, or Copper mixt with Silver, tho' they have likewiſe ſome few Silver and Gold Coins of their own. The
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52720:143"/>
two firſt of theſe ſorts are the moſt common, and which are always Coined in ſuch ſmall pieces, that it is very troubleſome either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving or paying out any Sum. Of the firſt kind are their <hi>Chelons,</hi> being of Copper Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd over, whereof three make a <hi>Poliſh</hi> Groſs, (the <hi>Groſſes</hi> of <hi>Dantzic</hi> being of greater value) and three <hi>Groſſes,</hi> the value of Two Pence of their Money: Tho' <hi>Hauteville</hi> ſays, theſe nine <hi>Chelons</hi> are not worth above a <hi>French Sous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Contributes to Poverty.</note> This baſe <hi>Poliſh</hi> Coin contributes very much towards the Poverty of this Kingdom. It was introduc'd on Account of Neceſſity, when the <hi>Poles</hi> had no Money to pay their Army, which began to Confederate, and join in a <hi>Rokoſz,</hi> for want of it. It is not likewiſe of late Days that this Coin has been introduced, for the Officers of <hi>Caſimir</hi> III. are ſaid to have coin'd it; and which was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards grievouſly exclaim'd againſt at the <hi>Diet</hi> held at <hi>Petrikow,</hi> in the Year 1459, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Reign of <hi>Caſimir</hi> the Great. In thoſe Days, it ſeems, the Kings had a Power to coin Money; and the firſt that reſign'd his Right to the Republick, was <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> III. in the Year 1632.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Other Coins.</note> The next of their Coins are called <hi>Chou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacks,</hi> being ſmall pieces of Silver of baſe alloy, whereof three make a <hi>Tinfe,</hi> which is alſo a ſort of Silver Money of baſe Alloy. This was firſt Coin'd to ſatisfie the Mutinous Army in the Year 1663, of the value of about 15 <hi>d.</hi> Theſe Coins are not the ſame in <hi>Pruſſia</hi> and <hi>Dantzic,</hi> as ſhall be ſhew'd hereafter. The <hi>Poliſh</hi> Silver Coins of good Alloy, are the <hi>Attine,</hi> or four
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52720:144"/>
pence halfpenny, and the <hi>Trigroſs,</hi> and <hi>Segroſs,</hi> the former of which two laſt is three, and the latter ſix times the value of a <hi>Groſs:</hi> Yet of theſe three there are at this day but very few remaining. As for Gold Coins, <hi>Caſimir</hi> the Great was the firſt that caus'd any to be ſtamp'd in <hi>Poland,</hi> but of which, either Coin'd by that King or his Succeſſors, there are few now made uſe of, the Silver and Gold Coins that have any Currency in the Kingdom, being for the moſt part Foreign. Thoſe of Gold are <hi>Ducats,</hi> which are worth two <hi>French</hi> Crowns, or two <hi>German</hi> Rixdollars. Thoſe of Silver are generally of the <hi>German</hi> Coin.</p>

                     <hi>Poles</hi> not very rich, and why.</note> Tho' it may hereby appear, that the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Wealth is not over conſiderable, yet ſays <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rovolſcius,</hi> it has always been ſufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray the Expences of the Kingdom, without the help of any Neighbours, tho' the ſame Author afterwards gives this Character of his Countrymen; that they are not over rich by reaſon of their ſending the greateſt part of their Commodities abroad, and generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving nothing in return, but ſuch as ſerve to ſupport Luxury, and encourage Vice. <hi>Hauteville</hi> gives another reaſon why the <hi>Poles</hi> may not be ſo rich as formerly, which is, becauſe of the many and frequent Incurſions of the <hi>Muſcovites, Turks, Coſacks,</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> into this Kingdom, who were accuſtomed to carry off great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers into ſlavery, and thereby to diſ-people the Country; alſo by reaſon of the many bloody Wars, and ſweeping Peſtilencies which this Country has undergone.</p>

And firſt I ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſomething of Salt, which was omitted in the firſt Volume of this Undertaking.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Concerning Salt.</note> The Spaces, or Allies, which I there took notice of are form'd by rows of large Pillars cut out of the Salt to keep the Earth from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in, and which, by reflection of the Light make a very agreeable Proſpect, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo many Rows of ſparkling Chryſtal. The Salt is taken out of theſe Mines in huge Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and laid in heaps all about the entrance, whence it is tranſported in Carriages through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Kingdom, except <hi>Pruſſia</hi> only, where <hi>French</hi> Salt is alone made uſe of. This Salt is ground in Mills like Corn. The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of this Kingdom have a right to any of theſe Mines, as likewiſe to thoſe of any Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals found upon their Lands; there being by the Conſtitutions no Royal Mines in <hi>Poland,</hi> except thoſe of white Salt only, which belong peculiarly to the King.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">No Fulling or Paper-Mills.</note> Throughout all <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Lithuania</hi> there are a great many Corn and <hi>Cachat</hi>-Mills, but ſcarce any for Fulling, or Paper, yet which they might very well have, by reaſon of their great number of rapid Streams. In this, and in other reſpects, the <hi>Poles</hi> are very negligent of their own Intereſt, being content to pay great rates for Cloth and Paper, when they might eaſily have both of their own Manufacture.</p>
               <p>

                  <note place="margin">Concerning Leather and Fiſh.</note> As for Leather, tho' no People uſe it more, (having almoſt all Boots and Chariots, which they call <hi>Ridevans)</hi> yet do they not care to take the trouble of dreſſing it themſelves, but ſuffer Foreigners to do it for them, and which commonly they pay very dear for when done. The <hi>Poles</hi> Trade very much in freſh Fiſh amongſt themſelves, and the manner of their Fiſhing, I imagine, may not be unacceptable to your <hi>Excellency,</hi> having ſomething peculiar in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Manner of Fiſhing.</note> Their Lakes and Fiſh-ponds in <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Lithuania</hi> being generally ſo large, that it would be almoſt impoſſible ever to drain them, They uſually chooſe to Fiſh them in Winter when they are all frozen up. They firſt make a great hole in the Ice to let down their Nets, and afterwards ſeveral little ones from place to place, that they may draw them along from hole to hole with a Rope faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to a long Pole, till they bring them back to the firſt large opening; When the two ends of the Nets are brought together, they pull them up, and bring out with them all the Fiſh that happen to be within the ſpace of Water thro' which the Nets were drawn, for they cannot poſſibly leap over them, becauſe of the Ice.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Honey, and its Produce.</note> Throughout all <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Lithuania,</hi> there are huge quantities of Honey to be found in the Woods, either in hollow Trees, holes of the Ground, or any where elſe that the Bees can find to ſettle in. Of this Honey, as I ſaid before, the People make ſeveral ſorts of Mead, with which, and the Wax that comes from it, they Trade very much into the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52720:145"/>
Neighbouring Countries. Now is it not a great wonder, that theſe Bees can produce ſo great plenty of Honey in ſo Cold a Climate? But it ſeems they find ſomething in the Fir-Trees, whereof there are great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in every Wood, that ſupplies the place of Flowers, which they ſuck their materials from in other Countries.</p>

                  </note> Before I proceed to give your <hi>Excellency</hi> a deſcription of the Famous City of <hi>Dantzic,</hi> I muſt take ſome curſory Notice of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Trade of <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> before its Inhabitants came to have the uſe of Money. In the XIIIth Century, the <hi>Teutonic</hi> Knights coming out of <hi>Germany</hi> into <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> brought along with them the Coin of their Country, for before that time the <hi>Pruſſians</hi> only barter'd Commodities with their Neighbours.

He ſays, that ſince it can neither be melted down nor is Malle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, it is impoſſible it ſhould be Metal, and becauſe it is too ſolid a Body to come under the <hi>Species</hi> of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> or <hi>Bitumen,</hi> it muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be rank'd among the precious Stones. This Amber is of divers Colours, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding <hi>Hartman</hi> inſinuates it to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſolid, yet is it certain, that ſometimes it is as liquid as Oyl.

               <p>THIS Letter courts your Acceptance on a double ſcore, your Learning and your Profeſſion.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Two Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities.</note> In the Kingdom of <hi>Poland,</hi> and Great Dutchy of <hi>Lithuania,</hi> there are two famous Univerſities, with all ſorts of Profeſſors. The former of theſe was Founded at <hi>Cracow</hi> by <hi>Caſimir</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> and was finiſh'd by <hi>Jagello,</hi> or <hi>Uladiſlaus</hi> V. in the Year 1401, conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the laſt Will and Teſtament of his Queen <hi>Hedwigis;</hi> And the latter at <hi>Vilna,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at firſt but an <hi>Academy</hi> Founded by King <hi>Stephen,</hi> but afterwards was erected into an Univerſity by Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> XIII. at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of <hi>Valerian</hi> Biſhop of that City, who had very much augmented the Colleges and Endowments.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Chief Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy there.</note> In both theſe Univerſities the Chief Study is to ſpeak good <hi>Latin,</hi> for as to all parts of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite Learning, the <hi>Poles</hi> are not ſo curious as in other Countries, yet have they a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that will write good Verſes, for their Genius is mightily bent that way; and beſides, they are very apt to quote Claſſick Authors in their Diſcourſe, and this particularly when they get Drunk, which is very frequently. Their Poet <hi>Sarbievius Caſimir</hi> is no ſmall Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament to his Country, who, in his <hi>Odes,</hi> has endeavour'd to imitate <hi>Horace;</hi> and the Purl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Language is not contemptible.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Learning formerly.</note> They have had ſeveral <hi>Latin</hi> Hiſtorians a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, ſuch as <hi>Cromerus, Starovolſcius,</hi> &amp;c. who have all Written the <hi>Annals</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions</hi> of their Country. They have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:52720:167"/>
had ſome <hi>Historians,</hi> who have written in their own Language. They alſo have not wanted for Learned <hi>Divines,</hi> Great <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,</hi> Famous <hi>Aſtronomers, Logicians,</hi> &amp;c. The great Aſtronomer <hi>Nicolaus Copernicus</hi> was a Native of this Country, having had his Birth in the City of <hi>Thorn</hi> in Regal-<hi>Pruſſia.</hi> The reaſon why theſe Learned Men have not tranſmitted more to Poſterity was, becauſe that while they liv'd there was but little or no Printing in <hi>Poland,</hi> that Art having been but lately receiv'd in this Kingdom.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Oriental Languages diſ-regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> Tho' the <hi>Poles</hi> are ſo extreamly expert in Speaking and Writing <hi>Latin,</hi> yet are they not curious in any of the Oriental Languages. They affect ſpeaking <hi>Latin</hi> to that degree, that Dr. <hi>Connor</hi> has inform'd me, that he had a Servant while he was in <hi>Poland,</hi> that always us'd to talk to him in that Language; and I have moreover read, that almoſt all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People ſpeak <hi>Latin</hi> fluently there, a proof of which you may pleaſe to obſerve in the firſt Volume of this Hiſtory, in the Life of <hi>Stephen Batori,</hi> who very much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted the Study of that Language.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Preſent Languages in <hi>Poland.</hi>
                  </note> As the <hi>Poles</hi> have the ſame Origin with the <hi>Muſcovites, Bohemians, Croatians, Moravians, Sile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians, Caſſubians, Bulgarians, Raſcians, Servians, Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyrians,</hi> &amp;c. ſo <hi>(Cromerus</hi> ſays) they have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the ſame Language with them, altho' they differ in <hi>Dialects,</hi> and that ſcarce to be underſtood by each other. Their terms of Mechanic Arts are chiefly borrow'd from the Ancient <hi>Germans,</hi> who formerly had, as ſtill they have, frequent intercourſes with
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:52720:167"/>
this Country. Nay, there are at preſent whole Towns and Villages that make uſe of the <hi>German</hi> Tongue, that Nation having formerly planted ſeveral Colonies in this Kingdom. Alſo there are ſeveral of the Noble Families purely <hi>German,</hi> as may appear both by their Names and Coats of Arms. Likewiſe <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, Armenian, Ruſſian, Tartarian,</hi> and in ſome places <hi>Italian,</hi> are frequently ſpoken in this Country.</p>

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Poliſh</hi> hard to Pronounce.</note> The <hi>Poliſh</hi> Language <hi>Cromerus</hi> allows, is neither ſo Copious, nor ſo eaſy to Pronounce as thoſe of other Nations, but as the <hi>French, Italian,</hi> &amp;c. conſiſts chiefly of Vowels, that of <hi>Poland</hi> is made up in great meaſure with Conſonants, inſomuch, that you ſhall ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times meet with <hi>Poliſh</hi> Words that have ſeven or eight Conſonants together without any Vowel, or at moſt but one, interpos'd, an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of which, Sir, you may have in the word <hi>Chrzeſzcz (Scarabaeus,</hi> a <hi>Gad-Flie,)</hi> this, with divers others in the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Tongue, ſcarce the Natives themſelves are able to Pronounce, yet they always have a ſort of liſping ſound of Vowels in their Pronunciation, tho' they do not write them.</p>

                  </note> It muſt not be underſtood, however uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally <hi>Latin</hi> is ſpoken in <hi>Poland,</hi> that the <hi>Poles</hi> have it from their Mothers, as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People have in ſome parts of <hi>Hungary,</hi> for they take pains to learn it from Maſters as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations do. The chiefeſt reaſons why they generally Affect it is, Firſt from their Natural Diſpoſitions to learn it. Secondly, By reaſon of the <hi>Syntax</hi> of their Mother-Tongue

the <hi>Sclavonian,</hi> which has great Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity with that Language, for they both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline their Nouns, and Conjugate their Verbs as the <hi>Romans</hi> did. Thirdly, Becauſe in all the Villages throughout the Nation, they have School-maſters for that purpoſe, who are either Rectors of Pariſhes, or ſome other qualifi'd Perſons appointed by them, or by the Biſhop of the Dioceſs. And fourthly, becauſe in all Towns of Note, the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> have Colleges ſet apart to inſtruct Youth in that Language.</p>

                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:52720:168"/>
Terms, than in the Nature of Things themſelves, which they reaſon about. In this Country they have a particular Veneration for <hi>Albertus Magnus,</hi> and quote him to atteſt the Truth of any Aſſertion, in like manner as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Italians</hi> are accuſtom'd to do <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> tho' they have not leſs reſpect for this laſt <hi>Philoſopher</hi> than other Nations have. Yet, notwithſtanding, they ſeldom take right his meaning, and particularly in matters that are Ambiguous, for they have Publiſh'd ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral large <hi>Commentaries</hi> upon him which do frequently contradict one another.</p>

In a word, they trouble their Heads but ſeldom about convincing their Reaſon of the Sublimity and Goodneſs of the Chriſtian Doctrine; implicit Faith, and Paſſive Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Council and Church-Deciſions being entirely their Guides. They will allow of no body's enquiring into the reaſonableneſs of Things, as if they ſhould imagine, that a Law, or a Doctrine given by God ſhould not be conſiſtent with Reaſon. They have a more than ordinary reſpect for <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> and <hi>Scotus,</hi> and their principal Erudition conſiſts in being well Read in the School-Points con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted by thoſe two Great Men.</p>

This Collection conſiſted of a great number of petrefi'd Bodies of Raiſins, Serpents, Wood, Toads, and the like.

The <hi>Poles</hi> make their Glaſs of Beech-Aſhes and great Pebbles pounded; theſe they boyl together for twelve Hours, till ſuch time as they begin to Vitrifie. When they have a mind to make their Glaſs clearer than ordinary, they are accuſtom'd to mix a particular ſort of Earth with it of the colour and hardneſs of <hi>Tartre,</hi> which renders the Glaſs of different Colours, according to the greater or leſſer quantity of this Earth mixt with it. I may obſerve that if Salt be mixt in the compoſition of this Glaſs it makes it more fluid and eaſier to be wrought by the Workman.</p>

                     </note> I muſt now come to the two Diſeaſes that are peculiar to the <hi>Poles,</hi> and ſo I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude. One of theſe is call'd by the Natives, <hi>Colton,</hi> and by us, <hi>Plica,</hi> and the other is term'd the <hi>Roſe.</hi> The former is an odd kind of Diſtemper, and frequently mention'd in <hi>Phyſick</hi>-Authors. Dr. <hi>Connor</hi> ſays it is one of the moſt remarkable Maladies that he has <note place="margin">Its Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>ever met with, yet is nothing elſe but the Hair of the Head matted, entangled, and in ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven like to fulled Cloth. Sometimes all the Hair of the Head will be thus Matted, ſo large that it covers the Shoulders, and ſo long that it comes down to the very Waſt, which makes them that have it put it into a Purſe that it may hang backwards; but generally ſpeaking, it hangs in twiſted Ropes, and that moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly on one ſide only. Others have only their Hair plaited cloſe to their Heads as little Children that are Scabby have; but however,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:52720:175"/>
thoſe that have the <hi>Plica</hi> never have any Scabs. <hi>Hauteville</hi> compares this twiſted Hair to the Ears of a Water-Spaniel. Dr. <hi>Connor</hi> ſays, that in his time a Gentleman at Court had it to that Degree, that his Hair hung like a Mantle about his Shoulders.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs.</note> The Hair will be thus entangled in one Nights time, tho' there be never ſo much care taken to prevent it, for the <hi>Poles</hi> having their Hair always cut round above their Ears, like to that of Monks, tho' it had never been comb'd, yet were it impoſſible it ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come thus woven all of a ſudden out of ſlovenlyneſs and careleſneſs, as a great many, and Dr. <hi>Connor</hi> himſelf ſays he believ'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he came into that Country.</p>

Beſides, what I have mention'd before of their cutting off
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:52720:176"/>
dead Peoples Heads is ſo common a thing, that even the late Queen, upon information that her Countrymen, the <hi>French,</hi> died in great numbers in their allotted ſtation in the City of <hi>Warſaw,</hi> call'd from thence <hi>Petit Paris,</hi> (Little <hi>Paris)</hi> caus'd the firſt Perſon of thoſe that died to be enquir'd out and dug up, and would have had his Head cut off to prevent a farther Mortality among thoſe People, had not a <hi>Capuchin,</hi> her Confeſſor oppos'd it, and inform'd her it was againſt the Cannons of the Church: He alſo was forc'd to threaten Excommunication againſt a <hi>Dominican</hi> Friar that had Orders to ſee it done, or it would certainly have been effected notwithſtanding her Majeſty was admoniſh'd to the contrary.</p>

He inform'd him moreover, that in one Night the Hair will be thus Matted, even in thoſe that take never ſo much care in Combing of it. He told him likewiſe, that the Symptoms and Pains were much greater when the Hair was often cut, than when it was let grow to any length. He alſo ſaid, that the firſt and ſecond time that he cut his Locks, he could ſenſibly perceive a vaporous and volatile matter paſs in great abundance thro' the Ducts of his Hair, which he ſaid, in its Paſſage, very much frizled and contracted his Locks. He more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over affirm'd, that when he put a Cap upon his Head it occaſion'd him intolerable heats and pain, by reaſon (ſaid he) that the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure thereof repell'd the eruption, and forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed back the Humours of the Diſeaſe upon his Head.</p>
