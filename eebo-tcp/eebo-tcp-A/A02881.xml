            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Now let vs come to the laſte parte of this concluſion, whiche is the regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſpirite,<note place="margin">2. Daungen opiniones.</note> wherein there are twoo daungerouſe opinions to bee taken heede of, the one of thoſe ſailyng abrode in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ſea of all vngodlineſſe, with the ſhippe of their owne filthie deſiers, without ſafe-conducte of Gods worde, promiſe vnto themſelues all maner of licentiouſneſſe, becauſe the mercy of God is freely giuen and his righteouſneſſe bountifully beſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed vpon his elect. The other is of them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> who mounting aloft with the waxed win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of their owne inuention,<note place="margin">The family loue and ſu like.</note> aboue the comon vſe and cuſtome of the life of gods Children, chalenge to themſelues phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſticall Spirites of ſinceritie. But as both theſe are moſt horrible, ſo they which doe either of them wreſt the Scripture, are moſt vngodly and damnable, vnleſſe they repent. For the Apoſtle in the ſixt Chapiter of this Epiſtle, ſeing the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly to chalenge vnto themſelues, that liberty ſaieth, that it is proper onely to
<pb facs="tcp:12887:11"/>
thoſe, whiche put one the righteouſneſſe of Chriſte, and that they are regenerate in ſpirite, and haue a pledge of this rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration in their baptiſme. But for other whiche cleaue not to Chriſte, he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the rigour of the Lawe, whiche ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmyng them with his curſſe, dooeth eaſely deſtroye them. Now as for thoſe whiche would mount alofte in their fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſinceritie, becauſe thei ſtudie all that in them lieth to make God a lyer, we are thus to perſwade our ſelues, that to walke after the fleſhe, is not to ſeeke to putte of all the ſenſes of the fleſhe, and to flie vp into the middle heauen, or altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſeparate our ſelues from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of the wicked, for that is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for man:<note place="margin">Cor. 5.10.</note> and therefore S. <hi>Paule</hi> wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng vs not to haue any companie with euill doers, ſtraite waie expoundeth hym ſelf, ſaiyng: I meane not that you ſhould not at all companie with them, for then you ſhould goe out of the worlde. And as I thinke this is the true ſenſe of this Scripture, to walke in the Spirite is to
<pb facs="tcp:12887:11"/>
be conuerſant in beatyng doune fleſhely luſtes, and to giue tokens of our hatered of ſinne. And therefore not yeldyng to the former opinions, to ſaie thus vnto our conſciences, I haue often fallen and ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned greeuouſly, but the Lorde hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued me to grace, he hath graffed me into the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion of Chriſt, he hath brought me into the fellowſhip of the Churche by Baptiſme. Therefore as long as I go on forward in faithe, although ſynne ſeeke to deale violently with me, yet ſhall I bee free from all giltineſſe and damnation, becauſe I beyng in the fleſhe, walke not after the fleſhe, yea, I abhorre all the lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes and concupiſcence of the fleſhe.</p>
            <p>To the confirmation of the Grace before concluded, might be proued by good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as if a man will alledge workes, we maie thus reply, If Saluation or iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation be by workes, then either by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect workes, or vnperfect, but not by vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect workes, for euery vnperfect wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke is ſinne, and therefore, if it be by woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes it muſt needes be by perfect workes,

whiche no man is able to worke, but only the ſonne of God, and therefore our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes be accompted vyle and of none effect.

For by theſe woordes the lawe of the Spirite of lyfe is vnderſtood, the bountifulneſſe and power of Gods Spirite, the power whiche bringes vs to a caſtyng awaie of the relikes of the olde Adam, and putting on of the righteouſneſſe of the newe man Chriſte, the bountifulneſſe whiche as it graunteth pardon, and aboliſheth the law of ſinne in vs, ſetting vs free from the gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe of death.

            <p>This which is heare called the law of the Spirite of life, is that Spirite whiche is promiſed to bee poured on the ſeede of
<pb facs="tcp:12887:12"/>
man, becauſe man without the moiſter of this ſpirit, is as a drie <note place="margin">Eſai. 44.3.</note> and barren lande.

            <p>Now that this freedome is confirmed to bee doen by the woorkyng of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, and not by woorkes, let vs ſee from what ſlauerie it hath freed vs, truely not as ſome thinke, who becauſe of this free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, ſaie that we are not bound to kepe the Lawe of God ſett doune in the tenne Commaundementes. No my brethren, that is a perilous doctrine, wherefore I praie you beware of it, for to be free from the lawe of Synne and Death, is not to liue as wee liſte, or to ſhake of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes together with the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall lawe, but it is thus to bee taken, that we by the grace of Gods Spirit are ſo confirmed, that the Lawe of concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence
<pb facs="tcp:12887:13"/>
is ouercome by vs, that we be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered from vnder the yoke of our affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſo that wee hauyng rule ouer our owne will, doe ſeeke now nothyng in all our dooynges, but to ſet forthe the glorie of God, to repaire the decaied Image of our former perfection, and to referre all our worldly practizes or actions what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, to bee ruled and ſquared by the written worde.

and working of the holy Ghoſte, as if a man would ſaie, truly it is an hard thing to fleſhe and bloud to thinke a bodie burned, eaten with the foules of the Ayer, or conſumed with the ſame, to meete a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine and to bee ioyned together parte to parte, and then the whole to the ſoule yet if ſuche an one whoſoeuer looke too the power of the Spirite,<note place="margin">The power of the ſpirite.</note> and acknowledge Ieſus Chriſte to haue riſen by the ſame Spirite, and then acknowledge him ſelfe to be a member of Chriſtes bodie he ſhall eaſely diſcerne this, and ſe that the power of the Spirite is not diminiſhed, but that it is the ſame whiche it was from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and too whome euery creature ſhall giue in accompte, and before whome euen the Sea ſhall bringe all the bodies it hath ſwallowed, the Beaſtes and foules all that they haue deuoured and eaten, and the Sonne ſhall reſtore thoſe Bodies it hath conſumed.
