            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Owsoever in the settled opinions of some wise heads this trifling labor may easily incurre the suspicion of two evils, either to be of an idle subject, and so fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous: or vainly handled, and so odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Yet my resolute purpose was to proceed so farre, as the indifferent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der might thinke this small paines to be rather an effect then a cause of idlenesse; and howsoever Love in this age hath behaved himselfe in that loose manner, as it is counted a disgrace to give him but a kind looke; yet I take the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in it selfe to be of that honour and credite, as it is the perfect resemblance of the greatest happinesse, and rightlie valued at his just price, (in a minde that is syncerely &amp; tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly amorous) an affection of greatest vertue, and able of him selfe to aeternize the meanest vassall. Concerning the handling of it, (especially in this age) men may wonder, if a Scholler, how I come by so much leasure: if otherwise, why a writer. Indeede to say trueth, though I can not just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly challenge the first name, yet I wish none to be writers, save onely such as knowe learning. And whereas my thoughtes and some reasons drew me rather to have dealt in causes of greater weight, yet the present jarre of this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing age drive me into a fitte so melancholie, as I onely had leasure to growe passionate. And I see not why upon
<pb facs="tcp:5921:4"/>
our dissentions. I may not sit downe idle, forsake my study, and goe sing of love, as well as our <hi>Brownistes</hi> forsake the Church, and write of malice.</p>
                  <p>And that this is a matter not so unfitte for a man, either that respecteth him selfe, or is a scholler. Peruse but the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of former times, and you shall see not onely others in other countryes, as <hi>Italie,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> men of learning and great partes to have written Poems and Sonnets of Love, but even amongst us, men of best nobilitie, and chiefest fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, to be the greatest Schollers and most renowmed in this kind. But two reasons hath made it a thing foolishly odious in this age: the one, that so many base companions are the greatest writers: the other, that our English <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian</hi> puritie hath quite debarred us of honest recreation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet the great pillar (as they make him of that cause) hath shewed us as much witte and learning in this kinde, as any other before or since. Furthermore for all students I will say thus much, that the base conceit, which men generally have of their wants, is such, as I scarce terme him a scholler, that hath not all the accomplyments of a Gentleman, nor sufficiently wise that will not take oportunitie in some sort to shew it. For I can say thus much, that the Vniversitie wherein I lived, (and so I thinke the other) hath so many wise, excellent, sufficient men, as setting their learning aside, wherein they are most excellent, yet in all habilliments of a Gentleman they are equall to any besides. This woulde that worthie <hi>Sidney</hi> oft confesse, and <hi>Haringtons Ariosto</hi> (which Madame was respected so much by you) sheweth that his abode was in Kinges Colledge. Yet nowe it is growen to this passe, that learning is lightly respected, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a perswasion, that it is to be found every where a thing untrue and unpossible.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:5921:4"/>
Now in that I have written Love sonnets, if any man measure my affection by my style, let him say, I am in Love; no greate matter, for if our purest divines have not bene so, why are so manie married? I mislike not that, nor I would not have them mislyke this. For a man may be in loue and not marrie, and yet vvise; but hee hee cannot marrie, and not be in love, but be a mere foole. Nowe, for the manner; we will dispute that in some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place; yet take this by the waie, though I am so libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to graunt thus much, a man may write of love, and not bee in love, as well as of husbandrie, and not goe to plough: or of witches and be none: or of holinesse and be flat prophane. But (wise and kinde Ladie) not to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble your eares with this idle discourse let this suffice I fonnd favours undeserved in such manner as my rude a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie wautes meanes to make recompence, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the meane time I request you to accept this: If I had not so woondred at your admirable and rare ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; that my hearte was surcharged with the excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding measure of your woorthinesse, I had not written: you are happie everie way, and so reputed: live so, and I wish so you may live long: excuse me, favour me, and if I live, for I am loth to admire without thankefulnesse, ere long it shall be knowne what favours I received from wise Sir <hi>Richard,</hi> to whome in all kinde affectes I reste bound.</p>
                  <p>For the Reader, if he looke for my letters to crave his favour, he is farre deceived: for if he mislike anie thing, I am sorie he tooke the paines to reade, but if he doe, let him dispraise, I much care not: for praise is not but as men please: and it is no chiefe felicitie, for I have hearde some
<pb facs="tcp:5921:5"/>
men and of late for Sermons at <hi>Paules crosse</hi> and for other paines so commended by all (excepting some fewe Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nickes, that commend none that do well) that you would have thought <hi>England</hi> would haue striven for their spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die preferment, but lyke a woonder it lasted but nine dayes, and all is quiet and forgotten: the best is they are yong men and may live to be preferred at another time: so what am I worse if men mislike and vse tearmes? I can say as much by them. For our great men I am sure, they want leasure to reade, and if they had, yet for the most part, the worst speake worst. Well, let the Printer looke he grow not a begger by such bargaynes, the Reader that he loose not his labour, and for mine that is past, and who so wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie after an afternoones sleepe gapes, and saith, Oh howe yong men spend their time idlie: first, let him spende his tyme better than to sleepe: Seeondlie, he knowes not my age: I feared a hot ague, and with Tasso I was content to let my wit blood. But leaving these to their dogged hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and wishing your Lady-ship all happinesse, I humbly take my leave. From my chamber. Sept. 4. 1593.</p>

If I were knowne I vvould intreat in the best manner, and speake for him, vvhome thou knewest: but beeing not knowne, thou speakest not against me, and therefore I much care not; for this kinde of poetrie vvherein I vvrote, I did it onelie to trie my humour: and for the matter of love, it may bee I am so devoted to some one, into vvhose hands these may light by chance, that she may say, vvhich thou nowe saiest (that surelie he is in love) vvhich if she doe, then have I the full recompence of my labour, and the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ems have dealt sufficientlie, for the discharge of their owne duetie. This age is learnedlie vvise, and faultles in this kind of making their vvittes knowne: thinking so baselie of our bare English (vvherein thousandes have traveilled vvith such ill lucke) that they deeme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves barbarous, and the Iland barren unlesse they have
<pb facs="tcp:5921:6"/>
borrowed from <hi>Italie, Spaine,</hi> and <hi>France</hi> their best and choicest conceites; for my owne parte, I am of this mind that our nation is so exqaisite (neither vvoulde I over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weininglie seeme to flatter our home-spunne stuffe, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish the credite of our brave traveilers) that neither <hi>Italie, Spaine,</hi> nor <hi>France</hi> can goe beiondvs for exact invention, for if aniething be odious amongst vs, it is the exile of our olde maners: and some base-borne phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses stuft up vvith such newe tearmes as a man may soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner feele vs to slatter by our incrouching eloquence than suspect it from the eare. And for the matter of love, vvhere everie man takes upon him to court exactlie, I could iustlie grace (if it be a grace to be excellent in that kinde) the Innes of Court, and some Gentlemen like stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents in both Vniversities, vvhose learning and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up together, vvith their fine natures makes so sweet a harmonie, as vvithout partialitie, the most iniurious vvill preferre them before all others: and therefore they onelie are fittest to vvrite of Love. For others for the moste parte, are men of meane reach|, vvhose imbased mindes praie uppon everie badde dish: men unfitte to knowe vvhat love meanes; deluded fondlie vvith their owne conceit, misdeeming so divine a fancie, taking it to bee the contentment of themselves, the shame of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: the vvrong of vertue: and the refiner of the tongue, boasting of some fewe favours. These and such like er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours (errours hatefull to an upright minde) common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie by learnlesse heades are reputed for loves kingdome. But vaine men naturallie led, deluded themselves, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive others. For <hi>Love</hi> is a Goddesse (pardon me though I speake like a Poet) not respecting the contentment of
<pb facs="tcp:5921:6"/>
him that loves but the vertues of the beloved, satisfied vvith vvoondering, fedde vvith admiration: respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting nothing but his Ladies vvoorthinesse: made as happie by love as by all favours chaste by honour, farre from violence: respecting but one, and that one in such kindnesse, honestie, trueth, constancie, and honoar, as vvere all the vvorld offered to make a change, yet the boote vvere too small, and therefore bootles. This is love, and farre more than this, vvhich I knowe a vulgare head, a base minde, an ordinarie conceit, a common person will not, nor cannot have: thus doc I commende that love vvherewith in these poemes I have honoured the voorthie <hi>LICIA:</hi> But the love vvhere with <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus sonne</hi> hath injuriouslie made spoile of thousandes, is a cruell tyrant: occasion of sighes: oracle of lies: enemie of pittie: vvay of errour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> shape of inconstancie: temple of treason: faith vvithout assurance: monarch of tears: murtherer of ease: prison of heartes: monster of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: poisoned honney: impndant courtizan: furious ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard: and in one vvord, not <hi>Love.</hi> Thue (Reader) take heede thou erre not, aesteeme <hi>Love</hi> as thou ought.

                     <l>LOVE I repent me that I thought,</l>
                     <l>My sighes, and languish, dearely bought.</l>
                     <l>For sighes and languish both did prove,</l>
                     <l>That he that languisht, sight for love.</l>
                     <l>Cruell rigour foe to state,</l>
                     <l>Lookes disdainfull, fraught with hate.</l>
                     <l>I did blame, but had no cause,</l>
                     <l>(Love hath eyes, but hath no lawes)</l>
                     <l>She was sadde, and could not chuse,</l>
                     <l>To see me sigh, and sitt, and muse.</l>
                     <l>We both did love, and both did doubt,</l>
                     <l>Least any should our love finde out.</l>
                     <l>Our heartes did speake by signes most hidden.</l>
                     <l>This meanes was left, all els forbidden.</l>
                     <l>I did frowne, her love to trye,</l>
                     <l>She did sigh, and straight did crye.</l>
                     <l>Both of us did signes beleeve,</l>
                     <l>Yet either grieved friend to greeve.</l>
                     <l>I did looke, and then did smyle,</l>
                     <l>She left sighing all that whyle.</l>
                     <l>Both were glad to see that change;</l>
                     <l>Things in love that are not strange.</l>
                     <l>Suspicion foolish foe to reason,</l>
                     <l>Caus'd me seeke, to finde some treason.</l>
                     <l>I did court another Dame,</l>
                     <l>(False in love it is a shame)</l>
                     <l>She was sorrie this to vewe,</l>
                     <l>Thinking faith was prov'd untrewe.</l>

Then she swore, she would not love,</l>
                     <l>One whome false, she once did prove:</l>
                     <l>I did vowe I never ment,</l>
                     <l>From promise matle, for to relent.</l>
                     <l>The more I said, the worse she thought,</l>
                     <l>My othes and vowes were dem'd as nought,</l>
                     <l>(False) (she sayde) howe can it be,</l>
                     <l>To court another, yet love me.</l>
                     <l>Crownes and Love no partners brooke,</l>
                     <l>If she be lyk'd, I am forsooke.</l>
                     <l>Farewell false, and love her still,</l>
                     <l>Your chaunce was good, but mine was ill.</l>
                     <l>No harme to you, but this I crave,</l>
                     <l>That your newe love, may you desave.</l>

                     <l>For light's the love, that's quickely wonne.</l>
                     <l>Kinde, and fayre-sweete, once beleeve me,</l>
                     <l>Ieast I did, but not to greeve thee.</l>
                     <l>Court I did, but did not love,</l>
                     <l>All my speach was you to prove.</l>
                     <l>Wordes and sighes, and what I spent,</l>
                     <l>(In shewe to her) to you were ment,</l>
                     <l>Fond I was your love to crosse,</l>
                     <l>(Ieasting love oft brings this losse.)</l>
                     <l>Forget this fault, and love your frend,</l>
                     <l>Which vowes his trueth unto the end,</l>
                     <l>Content (she sayd) if this you keepe,</l>
                     <l>Thus both did kisse, and both did weepe.</l>

                     <l>(Cardnal) farewell, be carefull of my sonne,</l>
                     <l>For once I vow'd, this never to have done.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>I and the counsell in Starre-chamber weare,</l>
                     <l>To whome the Cardnall did in haste resort;</l>
                     <l>Who brought the child, which ended all my feare,</l>
                     <l>The mothers care he briefely did report.</l>
                     <l>I kist the child, and tooke it in my arme,</l>
                     <l>Thus none did thinke I meant it any harme.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Then as the Wolfe halfe famisht for his pray,</l>
                     <l>Or hungrie Lyon that a lambe hath got;</l>
                     <l>My thirsty minde, I ment his blood should stay,</l>
                     <l>And yet the wisest not perceive my plot.</l>
                     <l>To'the Towre in haste I sent him to his brother,</l>
                     <l>And there with speed, I both at once did smother.</l>

                     <l>Nowe two there was, but living in my way,</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Buckingham</hi> and <hi>Hastings</hi> both to crosse my mind,</l>
                     <l>The one was headed straight without delay,</l>
                     <l>The other, favours did unto me bind.</l>
                     <l>To match our children, I did him perswade,</l>
                     <l>And Earle of <hi>Herford</hi> he him selfe be made.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Nowe as the Sea before a storme doeth swell,</l>
                     <l>Or sumes arise before we see the flame:</l>
                     <l>So whispering Brute began my drifts to tell,</l>
                     <l>And all Imparted unto babbling fame.</l>
                     <l>I dem'd it danger, speech for to despice,</l>
                     <l>For after this I knew a storme would rise.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Londons Lord Major, I used for my turne,</l>
                     <l>And caus'd him speake what treason had bene done,</l>
                     <l>I by these meanes the peoples hearts did turne,</l>
                     <l>And made them eye me as the rising Sunne.</l>
                     <l>Thus whilest I ment the Iland to bring under,</l>
                     <l>The peoples heads on newes I set to wonder.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Then at the crosse I caus'd a Doctor preach,</l>
                     <l>To tell the subjectes what I wisht them know;</l>
                     <l>The man was cunning, and had skill to teach,</l>
                     <l>Out of my braine I made his Sermon flow.</l>
                     <l>Thus every where I did such notice give,</l>
                     <l>As all did crie, Heavens let King Richard live.</l>

                     <l>So did <hi>I</hi> live, and called was a king,</l>
                     <l>Friendes swarm'd as fast, as Bees vnto the hive,</l>
                     <l>"Thus basest means the highest fortunes bring</l>
                     <l>The crowne obtaind, did cause my thoughts revive.</l>
                     <l>I scorn'd my friends, and those did most despyse.</l>
                     <l>That vvere the means, by vvhich <hi>I</hi> did aryse.</l>

                     <l>
                        <hi>I</hi> had no rest till all my friends vvere dead,</l>
                     <l>Whose helpe <hi>I</hi> usde the kingdome to obtaine.</l>
                     <l>My dearest friend, <hi>I</hi> thought not safe to trust,</l>
                     <l>Nor skarse my selfe, but that perforce <hi>I</hi> must.</l>

                  <lg>
                     <l>Nor speake <hi>I</hi> novv, as if <hi>I</hi> did repent,</l>
                     <l>Vnlesse for this a crovvne <hi>I</hi> bought so cheap.</l>
                     <l>For meaner things men vvittes and lives have spent,</l>
                     <l>Which blood have sovvne, and crovvns could never reap</l>
                     <l>Live <hi>Richard</hi> long, the honour of thy name,</l>
                     <l>And scorne all such, as doe thy fortune blame.</l>

                     <l>Thus have <hi>I</hi> told, hovv <hi>I</hi> a crovvne did vvin,</l>

                     <l>Where I doe end, my sorrovv did begin,</l>
                     <l>Because I got vvhich long I could not keep.</l>
                     <l>My verse is harsh, yet (reader) doe not frovvne,</l>
