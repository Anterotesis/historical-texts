            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Oſt Plaguye and moſt Confounded <hi>Ill Fortune,</hi> Thou that didſt favour <hi>Oliver,</hi> and <hi>Bulſtrode, Whitlock,</hi> that didſt exalt the Poor and Needy, and for many years together ſend the Rich empty away; Thou didſt bleſſe <hi>Clowns</hi> with the bleſsing of <hi>Mony baggs,</hi> and madeſt <hi>Jone</hi> as good as my <hi>Lady,</hi> why, Oh why haſt Thou left me in the Mire? I confeſſe Thy Afflictions are Vnſupportable, and Thy Fickle, Giddy, and Whimſical wayes, are to me unſearcheable. Yet Thou art not altogether without Compaſsion, Thou haſt oſtentimes returned to thoſe whom Thou haſt made Miſerable, and made them as happy as before thou hadſt rendred them Contemptible; When wilt Thou deal ſo by thy Servant <hi>John Lambert?</hi> I confeſſe I did Offend Thee with my Impudence, for I unſeated the <hi>RUMP</hi> too ſoon, I vexed the City too early, and ſhewed my Teeth before I was well able to Bite. Yet in one thing I Obey'd Thee, for I put my Confidence in a <hi>Fool,</hi> thinking Thou hadſt favoured him. If thy Maximes be not true, that was none of my fault. Thou didſt help me out of the <hi>Tower</hi> by Thy Favour; but Thou didſt very diſcourteouſly ſuffer me to be taken again (Hells Curſe light on Thee) and now my Tranſgreſsions, are multiplye'd before my Enemies: So that I am only leapt out of the Frying-pan into the Fyre. How long <hi>Ill Luck</hi> wilt Thou knit Thy Brows; and Frown upon him that was once Thy Darling. Remember what Thou haſt béen toward me, and for ſhame let not all the World ſée what an unconſtant Whore Thou art: Yet if Thou bée'ſt reſolv'd to make me the Sport of thy wanton Hours, I beſéech Thee to provide well for my Daughter the Infanta of <hi>Wimbleton,</hi> and ſuffer her not to be jeer'd to Death for the Folly of her Father; take not from my Wife the Comforts of the <hi>New Exchange,</hi> but enlarge the Hearts and Purſes of the <hi>Sectary's</hi> towards her, that ſhe may not be forc'd to keep in and ſigh in Fair Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but may ſtill viſit <hi>Hide-Park</hi> and the <hi>Spring-Garden,</hi> with a Pomp befitting their <hi>Generals</hi> Wife. And as for my ſelf deliver me out of Priſon if it be Thy Will, leaſt a worſe thing befall me, for I hear Innocent blood, and that Royal too crying out for revenge. Oh grant that the <hi>Portugal Embaſſador</hi> may beg me, and ſend me out of the noiſe on't, where it may happen that by Thy Favour I may be <hi>Protector</hi> in a ſtrange Country, that am ſo much deſpiſed in my own. But if Thou wilt have me Dye, Mazzle up the Mouth of gaping Hiſtory, that it may not publiſh my Diſhonor, and the ill Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of my Rebellion, my Effeminate Eſcape, and pittiful Submiſsion in the Field. More I might ſay, <hi>Dear Goddeſſe;</hi> But I never us'd to pray long, or much: And therefore do but help me out at this dead lift; and Thou ſhalt be my only Deity, to which I and my Succeſſors will aſcribe all our praiſes while the World endures.</p>
