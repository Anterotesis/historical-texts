            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>
               <hi>The PROPOSAL for the Raiſing the Silver Coin of</hi> England <hi>from</hi> 60 <hi>Pence in the Ounce to</hi> 75 <hi>Pence, conſidered; with the Conſequences thereof.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE protence for this is, That Bullion is <hi>bona ſide</hi> at this time worth ſix Shillings and three Pence of the beſt of our Engliſh Mony, tho' neither Worn nor Clipp'd: Now if this is true, then <note place="margin">It is now averr'd that Bullion in <hi>Holland</hi> is but 5 <hi>s.</hi> 2 <hi>d.</hi> the Ounce.</note> the Conſequence of it is, That an Ounce of Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Silver is made one Shilling worſe than it was before by having the King's Stamp put upon it, yet this Ounce of Silver may again be reduced to Bullion as it was before for two Pence.</p>
            <p>This Aſſertion in the mean time may eaſily be confuted, by try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how much Bullion or Spaniſh pieces of Eight may be had for a Mill'd five Shilling-piece of full weight, for by that the tryal is to be made, and not by clipp'd or over-worn old Mony; for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finer and Goldſmith will ever conſider the weight and fineneſs of the Mony he is to take for his Plate or Bullion.</p>
            <p>I believe it is very hard for human Underſtanding to conceive how an ounce of Mill'd-mony of the Standard-allay ſhould be made one Penny the worſe by having the King's Stamp put upon it, except it be by depriving Men thereby of the liberty to Tranſport, Melt, or otherwiſe uſe it as they think fit, as they might have done before it had that Stamp; and then, perhaps, it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to allow Men that liberty, which would occaſion the bringing more Bullion to the Mint than the raiſing the Denomination of the Species ever will. Men love to have in their own Hands the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of what is their own, and will not eaſily be tempted to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive themſelves of that liberty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:38559:3"/>
Tho' there are many Things alledged as cauſes of this riſe of the Bullion at this time, as the ſcarcity of Mony and Bullion, the over-ballance of our Trade, the Exchange running high againſt us abroad, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet the only true Reaſon why an Ounce of Bullion is worth a Shilling more than 5 Shillings of our Miinted-mony, is the Clipping, Corrupting and Wear of our old Minted-mony, by which it is made of real leſs value above the proportion of one Shilling in the Ounce; and it has been obſerved, that Plate bought at 6 Shillings and three Pence the Ounce, beſides the making, have yet after all weighed as much again as the Mony that was given for it. So that it is a wonder to me the Goldſmith has not raiſed his Plate to ten Shillings the Ounce; for ſo much it is worth when it is paid for in ſuch clipp'd Mony, beſides the making.</p>
            <p>This Method has, nevertheleſs, one ſignal Benefit and piece of Juſtice in it, which ought however to be taken care of if it be rejected, which is, the payment of all publick and private Debts in a ſort of Mony more proportionable to the Mony lent than that of the old Standard is; it being moſt certain, that all the Mony lent ſince the Revolution, is not of much more than half the Weight it ought to have had; and there is no reaſon that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides an exorbitant Uſury, freedom from Taxes at this time, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> theſe Men ſhould receive at laſt two Ounces of Silver for every one they lent; for ſo it will be, if the Mony be kept upon the old Foot and up to the Standard, when it is paid in.</p>
            <p>Having mentioned this, I paſs in the next place to conſider the Effect it will have upon the Royal Revenue and the private Eſtates of the Subject.</p>
            <p>The Book of Rates having fixed the Sum the King is to have for all ſorts of Goods Exported and Imported, he will certainly loſe 25 <hi>per Cent.</hi> in all his Cuſtoms of what by Law he ought to have: And yet it will ſoon appear, the Merchant will not ſell him any thing one Penny the cheaper, for he will raiſe his Goods on ſome pretence or other as much as the Mony is raiſed, well knowing that in 75 ſuch Pence there is but one Ounce of Silver: And the ſame Effect will attend all his other Revenues in every Branch of it, to the utter Ruin of the Crown; <hi>Which,</hi> as His Majeſty ſaith in His laſt Speech, <hi>is not able to maintain the Civil List, as things now ſtand, without the Aſſiſtance of the Commons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:38559:3"/>
The ſame Effect will follow upon all the Mannors, Rents of Aſſize, Quit-Rents and Fee-farm Rents, in whoſe Hands ſoever they are. When theſe Rents were firſt ſet, a Penny was a Penny weight of Silver; which, as Mr. <hi>Lownds</hi> rightly aſſerts pag. 17. of his Eſſay, was three times as much as now it is; and ſo it continued to the 27th of <hi>Edward</hi> III. when the Pound weight of Silver being 12 Ounces <hi>Troy</hi> weight, was raiſed from twenty Shillings to twenty five Shillings; which, in the 9th of <hi>Henry</hi> V. was again raiſed to thirty Shillings the Pound weight. In the 1ſt of <hi>Henry</hi> VI. it was raiſed to thirty ſeven Shillings and ſix Pence; but in the 4th of that King's Reign it was again lowred to thirty Shillings, and in the 49th Year it was again raiſed to thirty ſeven Shillings and ſix Pence. In the 1ſt of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. it was raiſed to forty five Shillings by tale, which was double the proportion it bore in the Reigns of <hi>Edward</hi> I. II, and III. and ſo on to the 9th of <hi>Henry</hi> V. So that by this time, all the Nobility and Gentry had loſt in their Mannors and Quit-Rents, the one half of their Income, and five Shillings over in the Pound <hi>Troy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In all the former raiſing the Mony of <hi>England,</hi> if the Hiſtory of <hi>England</hi> be conſulted, it will appear, That they were Times of great Trouble, when the Nation had been exhauſted by Foreign or Domeſtick Wars; and therefore it is probable, the ſame Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were uſed to perſuade both Prince and People to conſent to it, that are uſed now: But in the mean time it is wonderful that none of theſe Princes ſhould conſider, That as they raiſed the Mony, they abated their Revenues.</p>
            <p>That Riſe made in the 1ſt of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. ſeems to have been the moſt cauſleſs of all, that Prince being left exceeding Rich by his Father, and not having any War at home or abroad to occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion it. In the 34th Year he raiſed the Coin to forty eight Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings in the Pound weight of Silver, tho' there was but 10 Ounces fine Silver and 2 Ounces baſe. After this time the Corruption of the Mony grew ſo faſt, that in the 1ſt of <hi>Edward</hi> VI. there was 8 Ounces Alloy to 4 of fine Silver: And in the 5th Year of his Reign he put nine Ounces Allay to three of fine Silver, which raiſed twelve Ounces of fine Silver to 14 <hi>l.</hi> 8. <hi>s.</hi> and thereby the Miſchief became ſo ſenſible that the next Year after he began to reform his Mony, and eleven Ounces one Penny weight fine, and nineteen Penny weight Alloy was Coined into three Pounds by tale; and ſo it continued to the 19th of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> when
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:38559:4"/>
the old Standard of fineneſs, <hi>viz.</hi> 11 Ounces 18 Penny weight fine Silver and 2 Penny weight Alloy was reſtored, and the Mony Coined at 60 <hi>s.</hi> to the Pound <hi>Troy</hi> weight, as it ought to be now, and hath been ever ſince.</p>
            <p>By which it will appear, That the Nobility and Gentry were ſo wearied out by the deteſtable debaſing of the Coin in the Reigns of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. and <hi>Edward</hi> VI. that they willingly conſented to have the Mony raiſed to ſixty Shillings the Pound <hi>Troy,</hi> tho' there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they loſt ⅔ parts of what was paid to their Anceſtors, provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they might have the Mony brought nearer to its former Purity, tho' not full up to the Sterling Standard; which was after done by Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> and hath ever ſince been obſerved by all her Succeſſors.</p>
            <p>Beſides the value of Silver, compared with Gold and other Merchandize that is brought from abroad, there is another value belongs to it, which is to be found by conſidering the price of a Buſhel of Wheat, or a Years Wages of a Servant or Day-labourer. Now it is moſt certain that Silver, by the Diſcovery of the <hi>West-Indies</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> VII. becoming much more plentiful in the times of the ſucceeding Princes than it had been before; all that the Crown, and the Nobility and Gentry bought became much dearer, <hi>i. e.</hi> it coſt much more Silver than it did before, and yet the Incomes of their Mannors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were but one third of what had been paid to their Anceſtors: But then they helped themſelves a little by dividing the Church and Abby Lands among themſelves, and by raiſing the Rents of thoſe Lands which they had not put out of their Power; but the Clergy could not do ſo too, and thereby many of the Biſhopricks became exceeding Poor, that would have been Rich, if their Rents had been paid at three Penny weight to the Penny; for ſo every hundred Pound the Year they now receive, would have been three hundred Pounds.</p>
            <p>Theſe Conſiderations are ſo material, that they deſerve, at this time, to be reflected upon with the utmoſt Attention: And altho' it is ſaid, the Mony may be lowred to 60 Pence in the Ounce when the War is ended and Mony is become more plentiful; yet it may be obſerved, when once it is raiſed it can never be kept down, but will ſoon riſe again to what it was before: And if the People of <hi>England</hi> come once to pay 5 <hi>s.</hi> with 3 <hi>s.</hi> 9 <hi>d.</hi> they will never come back to the old Rent again without the hazard of a Civil War.</p>
            <p>So that if it be thought fit to raiſe the Mony to 75 <hi>d.</hi> in the Ounce, I humbly offer it to Conſideration whether it be not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:38559:4"/>
That all Quit-Rents, Fee-farm Rents, Rents of Aſſize, and all other Rents that are due upon Leaſes, ſhould be paid in the ſame Mony, and at the ſame value they were at before; or that at leaſt, the time be limited how long they ſhall be thus paid, and no other Tax, in the mean time, be laid upon them; this Tax being 25 <hi>per Cent.</hi> as the Owners will ſoon find, whatever is pretended to the contrary.</p>
            <p>The firſt Riſes were very moderate, but 5 Shillings in a Pound weight of Silver, which is 15 Shillings of our Mony in 3 Pound, a quarter part; but in the Reigns of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. and his Son <hi>Edward,</hi> when Silver was become much more plentiful than ever it had been before, it was raiſed from 37 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> to 3 <hi>l.</hi> which was above a third part; 2 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> and this would never have paſſed, if the Gentry and Nobility had not been ſweetned, by the giving them the Abby-Lands, or ſelling them at eaſie Rates, which was almoſt the ſame thing.</p>
            <p>Since that time there has no alteration been made in the value of our Coin, tho' we have had a Domeſtick War that laſted 20 Years, nor could any thing but this impudent Clipping and Counterfeiting of our Mony have made it ſeem neceſſary now; and if the Clipp'd Mony be made to go by Weight at 5 <hi>s.</hi> to the Ounce, it will put an end to the Clipping, and bring out all the Hoarded Mony too; and ſo put an end to this ſeeming Neceſſity.</p>
            <p>It were better to give 6 <hi>s.</hi> an Ounce for Bullion, and to pay it back again at 5 <hi>s.</hi> the Ounce, for then the Nation loſeth only 1 <hi>s:</hi> in every Ounce of Silver that is Minted; but the raiſing the Mony to 75 <hi>d.</hi> in the Ounce gives away 25 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> of all our Eſtates, as long as it is continued at that rate.</p>
            <p>The continuing the ſame Names of our Mony when the Value or Weight was alter'd, has been the Cheat that has deceived our Anceſtors, and it is to be hoped that this Generation is wiſer than to ſuffer it ſelf to be ſo deluded.</p>
            <p>In the times of Confuſion between the Years 1640 and 1660. the Merchants and other Monied Men began firſt to put their Caſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Hands of the Goldſmiths of <hi>London</hi> to keep it for them; and from that time the Clipping of our Mony became frequent, and as long as the Goldſmith would take it, no other Body ſcrupul'd it; tho' it may be obſerved to have grown every Year leſs and leſs, but eſpecially ſince the calling of great quantities out of their Hands for the <hi>Royal Bank of England,</hi> the <hi>East-India</hi> Company,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:38559:5"/>
and other ſuch publick Fonds; and there has ſpecial Care been taken by ſome Men, that all the good Mony that has been brought into the Exchequer in all this War, ſhould never go down into the Country again till it was put into as bad a Condition as the reſt; ſo that tho' no particular Man can be charged, yet it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent who have been the Promoters of this Miſchief, and for what End it has been done, and upon what Occaſion.</p>
            <p>There may be two Uſes made of this Conſideration. 1. That it is but reaſonable thoſe Caſh-keepers who have had ſo great a ſhare in the Profit made by this, ſhould alſo have the greateſt part of the Loſs left upon them. 2. That if any Mony that may here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be Clipp'd be left in the old Form, it will certainly be an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to continue both the Clipping and the Counterfeiting too, if Proviſion be not made to ſecure the Weight of it from time to time. It is ſaid, That 3 <hi>s.</hi> 9 <hi>d.</hi> thus Mill'd, will buy as much as 5 clipp'd Shillings. Now ſuppoſe it will, I ſhould think it but reaſonable to put us into the ſame Eſtate we ſhould have been in if the Mony had never been Clipp'd, and not to pretend to redreſs the Grievance by giving us Mill'd-mony that will go no further than the Clipp'd-mony will. It is intended, That a Mill'd five Shilling piece ſhould go for 6 <hi>s.</hi> 3 <hi>d.</hi> Now in Mony of that weight and fineneſs ought all the Quit-Rents of the Lords of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors to be paid: And whilſt ſuch care is taken of the Monied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men as to repay them the Damage they have done the Mony, by furniſhing the Clippers, and purchaſing the Bullion Clipp'd off, it is thought convenient to abate a quarter part of our Revenue, only becauſe the other 3 Parts will go as far as the Clipp'd Mony.</p>
            <p>It is alledged, if our Mony is ſo good that the Neighbour Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will draw it away from us, and leave us but little; but if they ſhould, we ſhall certainly draw in as much as is drawn out, and there will nothing be loſt but the Minting Charges, and it is hard if the Trade will not over-ballance that.</p>
            <p>But when Mony is ſcarce, be the Standard great or ſmall, it will not ſo eaſily be ſturred: And had our Clipp'd Mony been called in but 10 Years agon, we had now had ſome Millions of Mill'd-mony more than we now have. When the corrupt Mony minted by <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. and <hi>Edward</hi> VI. went with the good Mony of <hi>Edward</hi> VI, Queen <hi>Mary</hi> and Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the good Mony was hoarded up and Tranſported; but when Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> had once refined and reminted that bad Mony, good Mony
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:38559:5"/>
became ſo plentiful as the bad was before, and continued ſo till till the Clippers brought us into the ſame Eſtate we were then in.</p>
            <p>I have been inform'd (how truly I know not) that the States of <hi>Holland</hi> ſuffer their own Mony to be carried out and in as freely as any other Commodity, and yet for all that have ever a vaſt Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure by them. And we ſee all the ſevere Laws in <hi>Spain</hi> cannot keep their Mony at home; nor has that effect followed in any other Country: So that perhaps the leaving Men at perfect Liberty is the moſt effectual method of encreaſing our Mony; for then Men will bring their Plate and Bullion to the Mint, when they know it may be eaſily and ſafely reduced back to what it was before, or be Tranſported as it is to any part of the Earth where they can hope for Advantage: But if this is denied them, then they will keep it as it is, becauſe in ſo doing they keek the liberty of diſpoſing of it as their Occaſions require. Who would carry his Dollars to the Mint, who for ought he knew might have occaſion in a few Weeks to imploy them abroad, and by ſo doing ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the liberty to make uſe of what was his own?</p>
            <p>Men pretend that Foreigners will give more for our Mony than can be made of it at home. This is not true when generally aſſerted; there are times when they will draw our Mony, and there are times when we ſhall draw it back again, and ſome of theirs with it, as appeareth by our <hi>Guineas,</hi> tho' to our loſs perhaps.</p>
            <p>But when our Mony becomes ſcarce our Neighbours will gladly exchange Commodities with us, becauſe ſuch a value will grow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Mony (by what Name ſoever it is called) that there will more be ſaved by our Commodities than by taking our Mony. But ſtill this is upon a Suppoſition our Mony is reduced firſt all of it to the old Standard, both in Weight and Goodneſs, or Purity. The Clipping and Debaſing of our Mony is, by <hi>Mr. Lownds,</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be the cauſe of the riſe of our Guineas; but then it is as certainly the cauſe of the riſe of Plate and Bullion 15 <hi>d.</hi> in the Ounce; take away this diſorder and the Guineas will ſink, ſaith he, and ſo will the Bullion too to its former price of 5 <hi>s.</hi> 2 <hi>d.</hi> the Ounce, as it is ſold now in <hi>Holland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is in Mony an Intrinſick and an Extrinſick value. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick conſiſts in its <hi>weight</hi> and <hi>purity,</hi> and this may be fixed and kept at the ſame Standard, abating what by time and uſe is worn of it if it go by tale. The Extrinſick value is never to be fixed, but depends both upon the plenty and ſcarcity of Mony, and of all
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:38559:6"/>
other things that are bought with it. In the beginning of the Reign of Q. <hi>Mary</hi> the uſual price of a quarter of Wheat was 6 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> which is 10 <hi>d.</hi> a Buſhel. In the 1ſt <note place="margin">1 Phi. &amp; Mary, c. 5.</note> Year of K. <hi>James</hi> 1. it was 1 <hi>l.</hi> 6 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> which is four times as much. So that the Extrinſick value of an <note place="margin">1 Jam. 1. 25.</note> Ounce of Silver ſunk ſo much in that time, by reaſon of the greater plenty of it. By the 20th Year of that King's Reign the price of a quarter of Wheat roſe to 1 <hi>l.</hi> 12 <hi>s.</hi> that is 4 <hi>s.</hi> the Buſhel; ſo that an Ounce of Silver was worth almoſt 4 times as much in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Q. <hi>Mary,</hi> as it was the 21ſt of K. <hi>James,</hi> the plenty of it being 5 fold greater then than it was before. By the Year 1663. the quarter of Wheat was eſtimated at 2 <hi>l.</hi> 8 <hi>s.</hi> which is 12 <hi>s.</hi> the Buſhel; ſo that between the 20th of K. <hi>James</hi> and the 15th of <hi>Charles</hi> II. the Silver ſunk two thirds in its value.</p>
            <p>But then it is to be noted, That there are dear and cheap Years which depend upon the plenty or ſcarcity of the Commodity. Wheat has in my memory been ſold for 10 <hi>s.</hi> the Buſhel, <hi>viz.</hi> In 1648. and 1663. by reaſon of wet Harviſts, and yet in 1647. it was but 2 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> the Buſhel; and in 1690. Wheat was ſold in my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try for 2 <hi>s.</hi> the Buſhel, and the ſame Wheat the next Year after was ſold for 5 <hi>s.</hi> the Buſhel, which was occaſioned by exceſſive Rains that laid and ſpoiled the Crop.</p>
            <p>So the ſame Corn that is ſold in <hi>Kent</hi> for 6 <hi>s.</hi> the Buſhel, may be bought in <hi>Herefordſhire</hi> for 4, or perhaps for 3, by reaſon of the diſtance of the Country from a Market that can carry it off, and the price Men give for the Lands it grows on. But I think I may ſafely ſay, That a Buſhel of Wheat is ſcarce ever 2 Years together worth leſs than 4 <hi>s.</hi> which in the beginning of Q. <hi>Mary</hi>'s Reign was ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom worth more than 10 <hi>d.</hi> and therefore there is now more than 4 times as much Mony as there was in 1553. and conſequently that it is leſs than a 4th part of the value it was then. So that he that had then 10 <hi>l.</hi> the Year, could live of it as well as he that hath 45 <hi>l.</hi> the Year can now; and 50 <hi>l.</hi> the Year then, was equal to above 100 now.</p>
            <p>This is the true method of finding the Extrinſick value of Mony, for a Buſhel of Wheat has in all theſe times been of the ſame uſe and natural value; and I do not doubt but in the times of <hi>William</hi> the Conq. a Buſhel of Wheat was not worth above 1 <hi>d.</hi> of our Mony; and if ſo, an Ounce of Silver was worth 10 times as much in his Reign as it was in hers, and 48 times as much as it is now: So much has the Mony encreaſed ſince that time, and by its plenty abated the Extrinſick value.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:38559:6"/>
And altho' the certain Extrinſick value of an Ounce of Sterling Silver is hard to be now fixed by reaſon of the great abuſe of our Engliſh Coin, yet without queſtion it is not of the 4th part of that value that it was in the beginning of Q. <hi>Mary</hi>'s Reign; and it is as certain, that there is but a ſmall difference, of 2 <hi>d.</hi> or 3 <hi>d.</hi> at moſt, between an Ounce of Sterling Bullion and an Ounce of Sterling Mony, be it Clipp'd or Unclipp'd.</p>
            <p>Suppoſing this Project of raiſing the Mony ſhould ſucceed, that which is now but 15 <hi>s.</hi> Sterling would by the Law be called a Pound; and if 4 <hi>s.</hi> be raiſed upon every ſuch Pound, then the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder would be but 11 <hi>s.</hi> which with the Reparitions would come but to 10; ſo that by it one half of our Eſtates would be taken from us, tho' the Charge were but equal to that of the laſt Year.</p>
            <p>That Land in my own Eſtate that was Rented at 1 <hi>s. per Ann.</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> IV. hath for many Years laſt paſt been Rent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at 20 <hi>s.</hi> And this is another Effect of the Encreaſe of Mony in <hi>England</hi> ſince the Diſcovery of the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> which happened after the times of that Prince. We may well ſuppoſe that the Rents of thoſe times bore a proportion to the plenty of Mony as they do now; for where Mony is ſcarce there Lands will be cheap, and ſo on the contrary. And when the Nation grew Rich by the Peace of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Trade that followed upon it in the Reign of <hi>James</hi> I. the Lands became of double the value they were in the beginning of Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> only by bringing ſo much of the Spaniſh Silver and Gold into <hi>England;</hi> for beſides what we drew thence by our Trade, all the Mony that was ſent from <hi>Spain</hi> to maintain the Wat with the Dutch in <hi>Flanders,</hi> came by the way of <hi>England,</hi> and as faſt as it came in was ſent to the <hi>Tower</hi> to be minted: So that whereas in all the long Reign of Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> there was bus little above 4 Millions in the firſt 12 Years of his Reign; 1558014 <hi>l.</hi> 9 <hi>s.</hi> 9 <hi>d.</hi> which was much more than was Coined in her time in ſo ſhort a ſpace, if the Mony fetched out of the debaſed Mony minted by her Father and Brother be deducted, as of right it ought to be.</p>
            <p>Yet this turned much more to the Advantage of the Merchant, Shopkeeper and Tradeſman, than to that of the Crown, Church, Nobility and Landed Gentry. The Revenues of the Crown (the Cuſtoms excepted) were reduced to one third part of what they had anciently been; and that too was ſunk in its Exrrinſive value, as I have ſhewn above: So that King <hi>James</hi> I. as he made the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion richer than any of his Predeceſſors had done by his peacable
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:38559:7"/>
Reign, made himſelf the pooreſt King that ever ſat on the Throne of <hi>England;</hi> and this Poverty of the Crown was the occaſion of the Domeſtick War that happened in the Reign of his Son.</p>
            <p>The Nobility of <hi>England</hi> that had been ſo over powerful in the former times, when their Revenues were paid upon the foot of a Penny-weight for a Penny, that they were able to grapple with the Crown, became ſo poor by the raiſing the Mony to 60 <hi>d.</hi> in the Ounce, or the loſs of two third parts of their Mannors, that they retained only the Honours of their Anceſtors, but had very little of the Power and Splendor that attended them.</p>
            <p>The Gentry too, tho' they eſcaped better at firſt becauſe they had more of the Lands in their Hands which they raiſed the Rents of, which the other could not do by their Manners and Quit-Rents; but tho' they had the ſame denominations of Mony, had indeed but the third part of the Silver that was at firſt reſerved and paid to their Anceſtors: The Gentry, I ſay, too were over-topp'd by the more wealthy Merchants and Tradeſman, and endeavouring above their Ability to keep up the ways of Living that had been practiſed by their Anceſtors; this and the War that followed, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe Taxes paid ſince the War began, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have intirely Ruined many of the ancient Families, and brought the reſt under ſuch Debts, that there wants but this taking a 4th part of what is left, and the heavy Taxes that muſt be kept up during the War, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh their Ruine too.</p>
            <p>The Church, whether we conſider the Dignified Clergy or the Pariſh-Prieſts, have been as great Loſers as any of the other three; and if now their Revenues be ſunk from 20 <hi>s.</hi> to 15, and the old Rents of their Mannors, and the Cuſtoms in their Pariſhes ſtand as now they are, the Service of God in many Places will wholly fail for want of a Subſiſtance for the Miniſter; and ſome of our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhopricks, that are now but low, will find no Body that will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of them.</p>
            <p>The Love I have for my Native Country hath forced me to lay theſe Conſiderations before my Superiors, who perhaps in the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity of their other great Affairs, may not of a ſudden have all thoſe things repreſented by their Memories to them, which they otherwiſe well know, and I pretend to no more than to be their <hi>Remembrancer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If I have miſtaken in any thing, I humbly ſubmit it to the Correction of my Superiors, and pray, That at leaſt I may not be treated for this my Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to my Country, as have before been on all Occaſions, for no other Cauſe that I know of.</p>
