            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The <hi>CASE</hi> of many Coachmen in <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and within the Week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Bills of Mortality, Licenſed according to the Act for Licenſing Hackney-Coaches, but yet turn'd out by the preſent Commiſſioners.</head>
            <p>BY an Act made in the fourteenth year of His Majeſties Reign, for the reforming of Annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances and Diſorders in the Streets of, and places adjacent to the Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter. It is enacted that there ſhall be but 400 Coaches to be Lett to Hire in and about the ſaid Cities of</hi> London <hi>and</hi> Weſtminſter, <hi>and the places compriz'd within the Weekly Bills of Mortality, (excepting Stage-Coaches:)</hi> Which ſaid Coaches were to be Licenſed by Commiſſioners for that purpoſe, nominated by His Majeſty under the Great Seal of <hi>England:</hi> which ſaid Commiſſioners are to take five Pounds yearly Rent, and no more; for non-payment whereof, the Coach-men are lyable to a Diſtreſs: and for want of a ſufficient Diſtreſs, to ſuffer Impriſonment; and for any other Miſdemeanors committed contrary to the ſaid Act, are to ſuffer the Penalties and Forfeitures in the ſaid Act mentioned, which are fully ſet forth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by the ſaid Act. But amongſt them all there is not one word of a Forfeiture of the Licenſes, nor any Direction or Declaration that they ſhall be Licenſed for a year only, and no longer; nor that the ſaid Licenſes are determinable, or vendable at the Commiſſioners pleaſure.</p>
            <p>But not only in point of Law, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               </gap> likewiſe by an Expoſition upon the ſaid Act, they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be for Life: for the perſons firſt to be Licenſed, are to be Ancient Hackney-Coach-men, and ſuch Coach-men as had been Sufferers for His late Majeſty, or His Majeſty that now is, and the Widows of them, and lively Support and Maintenance of them; which intention of the Act would have been fruſtrated, and the Hackney-Coach-men abſolutely ruined at the Commiſſioners pleaſure, if Licenſes were grounded upon ſuch uncertain grounds, as the Commiſſioners that now are, pretend. For a Hackney-Coach-man not being able to Lett out to Hire a good Hackney-Coach, with Horſes ſuitable to the meaning of the Act, without a great ſum of Money to buy the ſaid Coach and Horſes, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

But it never was the intent of the Act to put them to this Charge for a year, which had been an intent to ruine them.</p>
            <p>Yet after all which great Expence and Charges, together with the great loſs of Horſes, that ſome have had. The Commiſſioners that now are, being 16 perſons, did at one time take away 16 Licenſes from 16 Ancient Hackney-Coach-men (as by their Summons for Appearance to 16 In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations in the Exchequer may appear) ſome of which have enjoyed their Licenſes ever ſince the firſt time of granting Licenſes by virtue of the aforeſaid Act: And all the reſt of them for many years, being Licenſed by former Commiſſioners, as perſons well fit and quallified, and alwayes by the former Commiſſioners ſo thought, approved and allowed to be without the leaſt moleſtation or interruption. And the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Commiſſioners, or ſome of them under pretence of a new method of Regulation, never before thought of, or mentioned, would have abſolutely ruined and undone the ſaid 16 Ancient Hackney-Coach-men, if ſome of them had not put a ſtop to it, by publickly declaring that they would Proſecute at Law thoſe perſons that ſhould buy any of their Licences, they queſtioning not but it was their Right, and due for life by the Act.</p>
            <p>And former Commiſſioners never looked upon any perſon once Licenſed , but as Licenſed for Life, notwithſtanding they did yearly renew their Licenſes: For the firſt Commiſſioners that ever were (being very Induſtrious and prudent men, and ſome of them well Learned in the Law) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that the only reaſon why they did renew their Licenſes yearly, was only that they might know what Coach-men were dead; that if any Licenſe were Vacant, forthwith to fill up the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy, for the better preſerving of the ſum allowed by the ſaid Act for preſerving of the High-wayes and Sewers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Names and Habitations of ſuch perſons as had Licenſes might be known, in order to the ſaid Commiſſioners giving in their account yearly to the Commiſſioners of High-wayes and Sewers; and to ſee what Fines and Forfeitures (if any ſuch) were due, and likewiſe to prevent the trouble and Charges of Diſtreſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By not continuing thoſe perſons Licenſes which did not pay, and diſcharge the ſums required by the Act at every years end; and though that Clauſe then was not agreeable to the meaning of the Act; yet that Declaration of the Commiſſioners, and the Acting purſuant to that Declaration made the Coach-men acquieſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and never were moleſted, But now, though thoſe Coach-men have paid their Rent duly as long as the Commiſſioners would receive the ſame, and ſince tendred it, and have performed all qualifications by the Act; yet are their Licenſes taken from them.</p>
            <p>Since which Tranſactions aforeſaid, by the negligence or indulgence of the Officers imployed by the Commiſſioners, and by the Licenſing of new perſons by the Commiſſioners, in the room of thoſe they turn out, the Streets have been, and are at this time ſo Annoyed, ſo many abuſes committed, and ſo many Coaches worked by Unlicenſed perſons, with ill Coaches, and poor Horſes: That the Hackney-Coach-men who are lawfully Licenſed, are not only blamed and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to be guilty of abuſes committed by perſons that work unlawfully; but are alſo very much impoveriſhed and diſabled to pay the Rent required by the Act, and very hardly able to live and ſubſiſt, contrary to the intent of the Act, to the abuſe of the Kings people, and to the Ruine of thoſe formerly Licenſed.</p>
