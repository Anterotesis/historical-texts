            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>OH horrid Monſters! what ſtrange Newes is here,</l>
            <l>When Factious Locuſts thus in Swarms appear.</l>
            <l>At <hi>Guild</hi>-Hall-Gate, where they do freely Vote</l>
            <l>For ſuch vild Scabs, who ſoon would cut the Throat</l>
            <l>Of Juſtice, and would have all idle ſport</l>
            <l>In Churches us'd; Nay, they a Tennis-Court</l>
            <l>Would make it, if they could (by Lot or Fate)</l>
            <l>Obtain the Pow'r to Rule in Church or State.</l>
            <l>The City Vermine in <hi>Guild</hi>-Hall did cry</l>
            <l>(Both <hi>Independent</hi> and <hi>Presbytery.</hi>)</l>
            <l>For <hi>Love,</hi> whoſe zeal ſo hot was ſet on work,</l>
            <l>That he declar'd hee'd rather ſee a Turk</l>
            <l>Then a Surſingle, Rub on, ther's none can</l>
            <l>Bowl better then this <hi>Independent</hi> man.</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> they aloud did cry</l>
            <l>
               <hi>With</hi> Jack Presbyter <hi>'gainſt</hi> Epiſcopy.</l>
            <l>Saying, <hi>Fowk</hi> was a Member fit they knew,</l>
            <l>Who had the Brains to cheat a ſubtle <hi>Jew.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>So well his Caſh, with curſed Self he loves,</l>
            <l>As did appear by thoſe left-handed gloves.</l>
            <l>He ſold the <hi>Jew</hi> alone, but after they</l>
            <l>Were gone, he made his Chapman ſoundly pay</l>
            <l>For Fellows to them, thus his pregnant wit</l>
            <l>Makes him a man for Parliament ſo fit.</l>
            <l>Next Eccho'd forth a diſmal thundring Voice,</l>
            <l>Crying for <hi>Thompſon;</hi> Oh ſuch helliſh Choice</l>
            <l>Will us undo; <hi>London,</hi> thy caſe all pitty,</l>
            <l>And pray theſe Vermine may not ſpoil thy City.</l>
            <l>Such Shrubs and Stumps will ſpoil a Royal Oak,</l>
            <l>Who have their Riſe from ſtinking <hi>Indian</hi> ſmoak.</l>
            <l>As this rare Pedlar, whoſe ever ſmoaking Brains</l>
            <l>Doth ſmoak and ſmell as hot and ſtrong as Grains,</l>

            <l>The next was <hi>Jones,</hi> another Smoaker, choſe,</l>
            <l>That all good ſubjects by the Choice ſuppoſe</l>
            <l>They did appoint that day for to undo</l>

            <l>For Independent Voices did appear:</l>
            <l>The Anabaptiſt and the Presbyter,</l>
            <l>Many of whom we may Malignants make</l>
            <l>Becauſe they never yielded yet to take</l>

            </l>
            <l>Which well their perſons might in queſtion bring</l>

            <l>Of Loyalty; I do preſume they are</l>
            <l>Choſe by Malignants; <hi>Ergo,</hi> 'tis not faire.</l>
            <l>Thus have you Four ſad Stewards choſe, God ſend</l>
