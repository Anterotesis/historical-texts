            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Particular Account of a Terrible and Bloody ENGAGEMENT BETWEEN THE <hi>Engliſh and French Fleet,</hi> IN THE BAY of BANTRY On the <hi>IRISH</hi> Coaſt.</head>
            <head type="sub">
               <hi>With an Exact Liſt of the Damage ſustained, and thoſe Slain and Wounded on both ſides.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>AFter all the many Falſe and Incoherent Relations we have lately received both of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Squadrons, there being thoſe who purpoſely give out their <hi>Shams,</hi> that the Reality may not be credited, we received an authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Relation brought to the Court by Captain <hi>Elmore</hi> Commander of the <hi>Edgar,</hi> who was preſent in the Engagement, which is to this Effect.</p>
            <p>That Admiral <hi>Herbert</hi> Riding with about 18 of His Majeſties Men of War in <hi>Milford-Haven,</hi> having received Intelligence that the <hi>French</hi> Fleet was about Sail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from <hi>Breſt,</hi> the Cloſe of laſt Month weighed Anchor, and made for the <hi>French</hi> Coaſt. Likewiſe being informed that the day before a Squadron of <hi>French</hi> Ships, compoſing 28 Men of War, 7 Fireſhips, beſides Veſſels of Burthen, were ſailed out of <hi>Breſt,</hi> having ſome Landmen on Board, ſtood after them with all the Sail he could make, and the Day after got ſight of them. But the Night coming on, the <hi>French,</hi> not thinking it ſafe for them to Engage, altered their Courſe from put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting into <hi>King sayle,</hi> and ſteered to the moſt Weſterly part of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and got into the Bay of <hi>Bantry,</hi> where they made all the Expedition they could to unſhip their Men, which ſome will have to be 3000 <hi>Engliſh, Scotch, Iriſh</hi> and <hi>French.</hi> And Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral <hi>Herbert</hi> reaching the ſaid Bay about <hi>May-day</hi> in the Morning, gave the <hi>French</hi> all the Provocations poſſible to come forth and Engage him; which they, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they were almoſt double the Number, would not adventure to come forth. Upon which, the Courage of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Seamen was ſuch, That they would adventure to Fight, thô upon great Diſadvantage. And thereupon the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral bore into the Bay with what Ships he could, which were not above Nine, and Encountred the whole Squadron of the <hi>French</hi> for about Seven hours; and never was greater Valor ſhewn than upon this Occaſion.</p>
            <p>The Admiral finding that it was impoſſible either to bring his Fleet to bear up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, or get them out of Harbor, contented himſelf, at preſent, with the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage he has done them, which is very Conſiderable, thô not as yet particularly known: And bringing off Two Ships that were ſomewhat diſabled in the Fight, has ſent them to <hi>Portſmouth</hi> to Re-fit, while he ſtays with the reſt of the Fleet to block them in; and 'tis hoped, that ſo ſoon as he can be joined with ſome other Men of War, to give a very good Account of them. The Loſs on our Side is only Capt. <hi>George Elmore,</hi> Brother to the Captain who brought the Account to the King, with a Lieutenant, and about 150 Seamen. And, 'tis believed, the <hi>French</hi> have loſt Treble the Number, with one of their Ships ſunk in the Fight. But we ſhall have a particular Account of this great Action in few days publiſhed at large.</p>
