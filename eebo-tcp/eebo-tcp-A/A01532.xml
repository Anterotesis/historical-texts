            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p n="3">3. That the <hi>Elements</hi> in the Sacrament remaine in <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> the same, and are not <hi>really transubstantiated into Christs Body and Blood,</hi> is euinced by diuers <hi>Arguments.</hi>

Which manner of being signes of Christs body and blood doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude but suppose the Accidents of bread and wine to containe the true substances of our Sauiours body and blood in them. So is</hi> Saint Augustine <hi>to be vnderstood, where he saith,</hi> Our Lord doubted not to say, <hi>This is my body,</hi> when hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered

the signe of his body. <hi>And when out of</hi> Gratian <hi>my Aduersary citeth those wordes,</hi> The heauenly bread, which is the flesh of Christ, &amp;c. is a Sacrament of Christs body visible, palpable, mortal, and pierced on the Crosse, &amp;c. <hi>So when</hi> Theodoret <hi>and</hi> Gelasius <hi>affirme</hi> the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance and nature of bread and wine still to remaine in the Sacrament; <hi>they meane</hi> not physicall substances and nature of bread and wine <hi>still to remaine after the consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> but onely the accidents <hi>to remaine vnaltered in their nature, signifying and containing our Sauiours body and blood vnder them. And if hee had cited the place of</hi> Theodoret <hi>fully out, he had vtterly ouerthrowne his hereticall and frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulent purposes of citing him. His wordes are these:</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do the sacramentall signes after consecration depart from their nature; for they remaine <hi>(note how hee spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of</hi> the signes <hi>not of</hi> the substances <hi>of bread and wine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining)</hi> in their former substance figure and forme to be seene and touched as before: but they are by our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding conceiued to be as they are made; and they are beleeued and adored according to our faith of them. <hi>So iudicious and learned is mine Aduersarie here and in other places, in the choise of his Arguments and Authorities al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged against vs. But howsoeuer he faileth in that, he will be sure to helpe out the matter by maiming and corruptly ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting such testimonies.

1. Here is <hi>a new distinction</hi> betweene <hi>the Elements of Bread and Wine,</hi> and <hi>the Sacramentall signes</hi> in the <hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist.</hi> And indeed if their <hi>doctrine</hi> be sound and true, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Bread,</hi> nor <hi>Wine,</hi> are euer, or euer were <hi>Signes of Christs body and blood</hi> in the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> though the <hi>Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients</hi> commonly so tearme them. For <hi>before Consecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> they are not; and <hi>in Consecration</hi> they cease to be, as they say: and <hi>after Consecration</hi> they cannot be, because they haue now no being: and so consequently they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer are.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

               </p>
               <p>I propound two <hi>Propositions</hi> to be prooued.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>the words are not to be vnderstood of any such corporall eating and drinking,</hi> as they hold.</p>

Secondly, He compareth the eating of his flesh to the Israelites eating of Manna in the desert; which was a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall food really eaten by them. Thirdly, If by eating his flesh and drinking his blood our Sauiour meant no other thing then that they should beleeue in him, it had beene a strange course in him, who so thirsted after the saluation of soules by an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure manner of speaking to driue away so many, such persons especially as had formerly followed him, without any word added, which might open this obscure doctrine vnto them; as</hi> Card.

<q>
                     <p>The ancients Fathers say oft, that the Bread in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist is Christs body.</p>
                     <p>But this saying <hi>(saith</hi> Bellarmine,) <hi>This bread is my body,</hi> must either be taken figuratiuely, or else it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd and impossible.</p>
                     <p>The Fathers therfore when they vsed such speeches, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed euidently thereby that they ment as we meane, <hi>(that is,</hi> they vnderstood Christs words figuratiuely) or else <hi>(by</hi> Bellarmines <hi>confession)</hi> they spake very absurdly.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Nor is it enough to prooue that <hi>I corrupt Bellarmine,</hi> to say that <hi>he disputeth in that place against Luther, who taught that bread remained still in the Sacrament:</hi> For what is that to the purpose? much lesse to say vntruly, that <hi>he spake not of bread consecrated;</hi> when the very <hi>Question</hi> is there concerning the <hi>consecrated bread.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>I cite Authors</hi> (he saith) <hi>that I vnderstand not.</hi> It is true indeede; In this very place I cite some sayings of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that neither I, nor any such <hi>dull-heads</hi> as I am (I thinke) can easily vnderstand; as for example, where <note n="p" place="margin">De Euchar. l 3. c. 24.</note> he saith, as I here cite him, that <hi>The Priest maketh Christs body of bread;</hi> and yet <hi>Christs body is not made by the Priest:</hi> And againe, <note n="q" place="margin">Ibid.</note> that <hi>the body of Christ that was crucified, was truly or verily made of Bread:</hi> And yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing <hi>Rupertus</hi> he saith else-where, that <note n="r" place="margin">De Euchar. l. 3. c. 11.</note>

                  <note place="margin">N. P.</note> 
                  <hi>and Sacraments is idle and forcelesse. For wee denie not (as there he supposeth) the Sacramentall Signes contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:3061:86"/>
the bodie of Christ vnder them to signifie somewhat di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct from themselues, to wit, the spirituall nutrition of soules liuing by grace that worthily receiue them. They signifie like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise Christs body and blood dolorously seuered in his passion. And so a thing considered in one manner may be a signe of it selfe in another manner considered, as Christ transfigured represented his owne bodie as now it is in heauen glorified: his triumphant entrance into Ierusalem on Palme Sunday figured his owne entrance into heauen afterwards, as</hi> Eusebius Emis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senus <hi>and other Fathers teach: and as an Emperour in his triumph may represent his owne victories, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>MY third <hi>Argument</hi> was taken from the Nature of <hi>Signes</hi> and <hi>Sacraments:</hi> whose <hi>nature</hi> is <hi>to signifie</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">T. G.</note> 
                  <hi>one thing, and to be another.</hi> The <hi>Argument</hi> is this:</p>
               <p>No Signes or Sacraments are the same with that that they signifie:</p>
               <p>But the bread and wine signifie Christs body and blood in the Eucharist:</p>
               <p>They are not therefore essentially either.</p>
               <p>To this <hi>idle and forcelesse Argument</hi> (as he pleaseth to style it) he thus answereth:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>the Sacrament all Signes signifie the spirituall nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition of soules liuing by grace; as also Christs body and blood dolorously seuered in his Passion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now 1. what is this to mine <hi>Argument?</hi> was this man (thinke we) euer <hi>a disputant,</hi> that answereth <hi>Arguments</hi> on this wise? which part of my <hi>Syllogisme</hi> (I pray you) is this <hi>Answer</hi> applied to? I had thought that a <hi>Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisme</hi> being propounded, the <hi>Answerer</hi> should either haue <hi>denied</hi> or <hi>distinguished</hi> of one of the former <hi>Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It is not true, that <hi>the bread and wine</hi> in the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> are <hi>signes</hi> of these things. Some <hi>affections</hi> of them and <hi>Actions</hi> vsed about them indeede are. The <hi>bread and wine</hi> themselues are <hi>signes</hi> of <hi>spirituall nutriment,</hi> not <hi>nutrition.</hi> The <hi>eating and drinking</hi> is a signe of it. <hi>Signes</hi>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:3061:86"/>
they are of <hi>Christs body and blood;</hi> not of the <hi>dolorous se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering</hi> of them in the <hi>passion,</hi> though their being apart is a <hi>signe</hi> of it also.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He saith that <hi>a thing in one manner considered may be a Signe of it selfe in another manner considered: as Christ transfigured of himselfe now in heauen glorified; his trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant entrance into Ierusalem of his triumphant entrance into heauen; and an Emperour in his triumph may represent his owne victorie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But 1. If <hi>signum &amp; res signata, the Signe and the thing signified</hi> by it be <hi>relatiues</hi> (as without all Question they are) a <hi>Father</hi> may as well be <hi>a father</hi> to himselfe, as a <hi>signe</hi> may be the <hi>signe</hi> of it selfe. Not to adde that the <hi>Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents</hi> (as hath formerly beene shewen) are wont to call the <hi>Sacraments pictures,</hi> and <hi>pledges:</hi> and it is against com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sense to say that ought is either a <hi>picture,</hi> or a <hi>pledge</hi> of it selfe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I might well put this <hi>Defendant</hi> to prooue that <hi>Christs transfiguration</hi> was a <hi>representation of his present</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">a Math. 17. 24</note> 
                  <hi>glorification,</hi> or that <note n="b" place="margin">Math. 21. 7-10.</note> his <hi>entrance into Ierusalem</hi> was <hi>a type of his glorious entrance into heauen,</hi> whatsoeuer his bastard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Eusebius Emissenus</hi> say of it; whose <hi>authoritie</hi> is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then his owne.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let him haue what he would; that the one was a <hi>type</hi> of the other: Doth it follow; <hi>Christs transfiguration was a type of his glorification: therefore Christ was a type or a signe of himselfe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>An Emperour</hi> and his <hi>victorie</hi> (I suppose) are not all one; no more then <hi>Christs body</hi> and the <hi>glorification</hi> of it; nor againe the <hi>transfiguration,</hi> &amp; the present <hi>glorification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Argument</hi> therefore is neither <hi>idle</hi> nor <hi>forceless<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Person would as he doth there, make such an inference? Christs hands and feete were visible and palpable after his passion (which tediously and needelesly he prooueth,) But they are not so in the Eucharist:</hi> Ergo, <hi>the naturall parts of Christs bodie are not at all in it. For if the Argument were good, we might rightly inferre that Christ had no body at all when in Emaus (for example) after he had blessed and brake bread, he vanished out of the Disciples sight; when he hid himselfe from the Iewes, who would haue stoned him, in the Temple, not by running into a corner (as this grosse fellow peraduenture may of Christ basely and vnworthily imagine) but by becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming vndiscernable by them; as he became also inuisible and impalpable to the Nazarites holding and drawing him to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the hill on which there Citie was built, whence they ment to tumble him. As if locall extension, visibilitie, palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie and other naturall Accidents and sensible properties could not by Gods omnipotency be seuered from his owne bodie without the totall destruction thereof. This is a grosse kinde of Philosophie and Diuinitie fit for such a stupide Professour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>MY fourth <hi>Argument</hi> was taken from <hi>the Nature of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">T. G.</note> 
                  <hi>Christs Body,</hi> which hath <hi>slesh, blood</hi> and <hi>bones,</hi> is an <hi>organicall body,</hi> endued with <hi>limmes</hi> and <hi>lineaments,</hi> yea and <hi>life</hi> too. Whereas that which is giuen and receiued in the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> is (as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> well obserueth) <hi>liuelesse</hi> and <hi>limmelesse,</hi> &amp;c. Now here, (according to his vsuall manner) he letteth the <hi>Argument</hi> goe, and falleth to raile downe right; that it is <hi>an argument grossely carnall, and vnfit indeede to be answered, of a babbling and ignorant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and a stupide professour.</hi> He sheweth where his shoe wringeth him. Yet that he may not seeme to say nothing to it; he frameth me an <hi>Argument</hi> of his owne on this wise: <hi>Christs hands and feete were visible and palpable af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Passion:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But they are not so in the Eucharist: ergò</p>

organicall.</hi> But their silly sorry <hi>wafer-cake</hi> hath none of all these. And then he telleth vs that I might as well <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme</hi> that <hi>Christ had no body when</hi>

               <p>But many eate of the Eucharist that are vnfaithfull, and are out of Christ: Ergò, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Proposition</hi> of this latter <hi>Syllogisme</hi> he denyeth, and saith it is a meere <hi>falshood:</hi> and why so? forsooth <hi>they deny it themselues.</hi> And why doe they so? because <hi>the holy Fathers say that Iudas and the Corinthians blamed by S.

Neither vrge we this alone, (as he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truely here affirmeth;) But wee vrge diuerse other pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages also (as before hath beene shewed) wherein our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour expoundeth himselfe; obserued by <hi>Augustine</hi> long since, and by their <hi>Flaunders Bishop Iansenius</hi> of late, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side diuerse others of their owne.

<pb n="210" facs="tcp:3061:111"/>
did hee not then produce it, where the place was discus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed? But he thought it better and safer (it seemeth) to let all this alone there, lest the <hi>allegations</hi> to the contrary being then in the eie, might easily conuince him of grosse and palpable falshood.</p>

                  <hi>It is not</hi> (saith he) <hi>any sacramentall drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, but a spirituall that our Sauiour speaketh of in that 6. of Iohn. For there is, as</hi> Albertus Magnus <hi>she weth, a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold drinking of Christ: a sacramentall, that the Priests one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receiue; an intellectuall, that the people take in the species of bread; and a spirituall, which all vse that are to be saued, by daily deuout meditation ruminating on Christs incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and his passion: And of this drinking our Sauiour speaketh in Iohn 6. as the very series of the Euangelists wordes clearely sheweth. For when some of them that heard it, murmured, our Sauiour said,</hi> 
                  <note n="t" place="margin">Ioh. 6. 61. 62, 63.</note> Doth this scandalize you? What if you should see the Sonne of Man ascend where before he was? It is the spirit that quickeneth, the flesh profiteth nothing. <hi>In which wordes he declareth that hee speaketh not there of any carnall eating or drinking: But would you plainly see that he speaketh of spirituall eating, that is, by faith? Marke what hee saith:</hi> 
                  <note n="u" place="margin">Ioh. 6. 54.</note> He that eateth and drinketh. <hi>He speaketh in the present tense, not in the future. There were euen then those that so ate him and dranke him, when as the Sacrament was not yet instituted. And how did they then eate and drinke Christ, but spiritually by faith, and loue, and doing his wordes? For he said also before,</hi> 
                  <note n="x" place="margin">Ioh. 6. 35.</note> I am
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:3061:111"/>
the bread of life; hee that commeth vnto mee, shall not hunger; and he that beleeueth in me shall not thirst. <hi>For Christs speech was figuratiue. So also the Glosser vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth this Gospell: and so doth that great Augustine, noble both for doctrine and modestie, whose glory is so great, that no mans commendation can adde to his credit, no mans dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praise can disparage him.</hi> And yet dare this <hi>shamelesse out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facer</hi> confidently affirme that none of the <hi>Fathers</hi> euer so expounded the place: and that the <hi>Heretickes</hi> (as he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemeth them, as if none but they so expounded it) had no other inducement so to expound it, but those wordes onely; <note n="y" place="margin">And yet those words also doth <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand</hi> vse to prooue that <hi>Christs</hi> wordes <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 54, 55. are meant of <hi>eating spiritually,</hi> not <hi>corporal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> In rational, diuin, p. 2. l. 4. ad 6. p.

and make</hi> S. Paul <hi>to interpret these words of our Sauiour for vs,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. <hi>saying.</hi> As oft as you shall doe this, you shal represent or declare Christs death till hee come. <hi>Which is best declared and represented by the parts of the Sacrifice and Sacrament, as they containe the very body and blood of our Sauiour in them. For so himselfe present seemeth to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph more gloriously, and exhibite vnto vs a more liuely me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie of his passion, then if the Sacrament were no more then a bare signe thereof.</hi>

So euident was hee and the Primatiue flourishing Church of Christ in his daies, in these and all other points Catholike, and continued so in our Countrey and other Christian parts of the world vntill</hi> Luthers <hi>foule Apostasie and reuolt from it.</hi>

Bede <hi>testifieth: whose religion is euidently knowne and confessed by our chiefe Aduersaries to haue beene Romane and Catholike. And neuer any countrey was in any age conuerted from Paganisme to Christ, but it receiued our doctrine, namely, the practise of the Masse and beleefe of the Sacrament.</hi>

               <p>§ 12. TO passe by his impertinent <hi>Catalogue</hi> of by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matters <note place="margin">T. G.</note> in <hi>Constantines</hi> time; (whereof some also are vntrue, and some vncertaine;) which he is very forward to run out into, willing to be dealing with any thing, though neuer so impertinent, then the point that against his will he must be held to: Whereunto I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer no more for the present, but this; Let him first quit himselfe of the <hi>taske</hi> that he hath already vndertaken, to wit, to maintaine this their <hi>Metaphysicall Transmutation</hi> in the <hi>Eucharist;</hi> and when he hath so done let him then produce, if he can, any one <hi>Article of Faith,</hi> that was held generally as such <hi>in Constantines time</hi> by vs now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected, and he shall not want <hi>an Answere.</hi> But to passe by this (I say) he would make vs beleeue (if we will take
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:3061:120"/>
it on his word) that <hi>the Brittish auncient inhabitants of this Ile held the same beleefe concerning this Sacrament, that the Romanists doe at this day.</hi> All the <hi>reason</hi> he produceth for it is this, that <hi>they differed from Augustine that was sent by Pope Gregorie into England onely in some ceremonies about Baptisme, and the obseruation of Easter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Surely this man hath a notable vaine in disputing and arguing: he can prooue any thing, if you doe but grant him all that he saith. <hi>The Brittish Inhabitants</hi> (saith he) <hi>here presently after the Apostles time held Transubstantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then, as we doe now at Rome.</hi> Whereas he well knoweth that <note n="*" place="margin">Doctrinam hanc de con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersione hac, seu de Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one non ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modum anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam esse di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunt Schola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stici, inter quos lo, Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus dist. 4. q. 1. &amp; d. 11. q 3. &amp; Gabr.

               <p>Yea but (saith he) <hi>there was no difference here about it, when Austin came into these parts,</hi> betweene him and them that hee found here. But I demand how it appeareth that <hi>Gregorie</hi> that sent <hi>Austin,</hi> held <hi>Transubstantiation?</hi> or that in the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> it was then held? Till hee can prooue this to vs, not out of <hi>lying Legends</hi> or <hi>bastard writings,</hi> but out of some <hi>authentick Story,</hi> or <hi>Gregories owne</hi> vndoubted <hi>workes,</hi> we haue little reason to beleeue him. <note n="s" place="margin">Bellarm. de Euchar. l. 2. c. 32.</note>

               <p>Yea that long after <hi>Augustines</hi> time the same beleefe of the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> that we at this day hold, was common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taught and professed publikely in this <hi>Iland,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the manifold <hi>monuments</hi> by that <hi>Popish faction</hi> suppressed, appeareth by some of them in <hi>ancient Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripts</hi> yet extant, and of late published also in print.

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Epistles</hi> and <hi>Sermons</hi> written in the <hi>Saxon</hi> tongue, of one <hi>Aelfricke</hi> a man of great note for learning, that liued about the yeere 990. wherein the same <hi>doctrine</hi> is taught concerning the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi> that we hold at this day, and the contrary <hi>Popish doctrine</hi> is impugned.</p>
               <p>In an <hi>Epistle</hi> of his written for <hi>Wulfsine</hi> then <hi>Bishop of Shyrburn</hi> to his <hi>Clerks</hi> bearing title of <hi>a Sacerdotall Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>node,</hi> he saith, that <hi>The holy Housell is Christs bodie, not bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, but ghostly: Not the body that he suffered in, but the body of which he spake, when hee blessed bread and wine to housell, and said by the blessed bread, This is my body; and by the holy wine, This is my blood.</hi> And that <hi>the Lord that then
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:3061:121"/>
turned that bread to his body, doth still by the Priests hands blesse bread and wine to his ghostly body and his ghostly blood.</hi> And in another <hi>Epistle</hi> to <hi>Wulstane Archbishop of Yorke;</hi> that <hi>The Lord halloweth daily by the hands of the Priest, bread to his body, and wine to his blood in ghostly mystery. And yet notwithstanding that liuely bread is not bodily so, nor the selfe same body that Christ suffered in: nor that holy wine is the Sauiours blood, which was shed for vs in bodily thing, but in ghostly vnderstanding.</hi> And that <hi>that bread is his body, and that wine his blood, as the heauenly bread, which we call Manna, was his body, and the cleere water which did then run from the stone in the wildernes was truely his blood; as</hi> S. Paul <hi>saith,</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 4.</note> And that stone was <hi>Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in the <hi>Paschall Homily</hi> by him translated out of <hi>Latine,</hi> and read commonly then on <hi>Easter-day; Men</hi> (saith hee) <hi>haue often searched, and doe as yet search how bread that is gathered of corne, and through fires heat baked, may be turned to Christs body; or how wine that is pressed out of many grapes is turned through one blessing to the Lords blood.</hi> To which he there answereth, that <hi>it is so by signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, as Christ is said to be Bread, a Rocke, a Lamb, a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not after truth of nature.</hi> And againe hauing demanded, <hi>Why is that holy housell then called Christs body and his blood, if it be not truely that that it is called?</hi> Hee answereth, <hi>It is so truely in a ghostly mysterie.</hi> And then explicating fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the manner of this change; <hi>As</hi> (saith he) <hi>an heathen childe when hee is Christened, yet hee altereth not his shape without, though hee be changed within: and as the holy wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Baptisme after true nature is corruptible water, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ghostly mystery hath spirituall vertue.</hi> And so saith he; <hi>The holy Housell is naturally corruptible bread &amp; corruptible wine, but is by might of Gods word truely Christs body and blood, yet not bodily, but ghostly.</hi> And afterward hee setteth downe diuerse <hi>differences</hi> betweene <hi>Christs naturall body</hi> and it. <hi>Much is betwixt the body that Christ suffered in, and the body that he hallowed to housell: 1. The body that hee suffered in was bred of the flesh of Mary, with blood, and bone,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:3061:122"/>
and skin, and sinewes, in humane limmes, and a liuing Soule. His ghostly body which we call the housell, is gathered of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cornes without blood and bone, limme and soule. And it is therefore called a mystery, because therein is one thing seen, and another thing vnderstood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Christs body that he suffred in and rose from death, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer dieth henceforth, but is eternall and impassible: That housel is temporall, not eternall, corruptible, and dealed into sundry parts, chewed betweene the teeth, and sent into the belly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>This mysterie is a pledge and figure. Christs body is truth it selfe. This pledge doe we keepe mystically, vntill we come vnto the truth it selfe, and then is this pledge ended. Truly it is, as we said Christs body and blood, not bodily, but ghostly.</hi> And yet further he addeth that, <hi>As the Stone in the wildernesse, from whence the water ran, was not bodily Christ, but did signifie Christ, though the Apostle say,</hi> 
                  <note n="c" place="margin">1. Cor. 10. 4</note> That stone was Christ: <hi>so that heauenly meate that fed them 40. yeeres, and that water that gushed from the Stone, had signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Christs body and blood, and was the same that wee now offer, not bodily, but ghostly.</hi> And that, <hi>As Christ tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by inuisible might the bread to his body and the wine to his blood before he suffred; so he did in the wildernesse turne the heauenly meate to his flesh, and the flowing water to his owne blood, before hee was borne.</hi> That, <hi>when our Sauiour said,</hi> 
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Ioh. 6. 54.</note> Hee that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath euerlasting life; <hi>He bad them not eate the body where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he was enclosed, nor to drinke that blood which hee shed for vs: but he ment that holy housel, which is ghostly his body and his blood; and hee that tasteth it with beleeuing heart, hath euerlasting life.</hi> That, <hi>As the sacrifices had a sore-sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of Christs body which he offered to his Father in Sacrifice: So the housell that wee hallaw at Gods Altar is a remembrance of Christs body which he offered for vs, and of his blood which he shed for vs: which suffering once done by him is daily renewed in a mystery of holy housell.</hi> Lastly, that <hi>This holy housell is both Christs body, and the bodie of
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:3061:122"/>
all faithfull men after ghostly mysterie: and so when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it, we receiue our selues too. For,</hi> 
                  <note n="e" place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 27.</note> You are Christs body <hi>saith the Apostle; and,</hi> 
                  <note n="f" place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 17.</note> We many bee one bread, and one body.</p>
               <p>Whence it is apparent that the same <hi>Faith</hi> that wee hold concerning <hi>the Sacrament of the Eucharist,</hi> and <hi>Christs presence in it</hi> was publikely taught and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily professed in this <hi>Iland</hi> euen for a long time also af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Austins</hi> accesse into these parts. So far is it from that which this flourisher affirmeth, that the ancient <hi>Brittons</hi> neere the Apostles times were of the same <hi>Faith</hi> &amp; iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in that <hi>point</hi> with our <hi>Romanists.</hi> But lost labour it is, and (as <hi>Optatus</hi> speaketh) <note n="g" place="margin">Quae est ista noua &amp; stulta sapientia, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitatem quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rere in visce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus vetusta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis?
