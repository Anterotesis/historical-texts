            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>There are besides these, many other accidents that may serue to shew the many enormities, wherewith hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine conditions make their soules blacke, and putrified, for wee see all men grow <hi>A malo ad peius,</hi> and all thinges we perceiue to waxe dayly worse, and worse, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease in their vertue. The ayre is oftentimes corrupt, sometimes with vntimely showres, sometimes with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable drinesse: now with two much colde, now with extreame heate. The fruitfulnesse of the field is not such as it hath beene before time. Ritches, and substance we see consumed, the progeny of Noble men we perceiue not to be multiplyed, but decreased either by discord or disloyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Lords and great men bend their cogitations to the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing of their poore Tennants, and by often fines, and exactions, bring honest men to beggery, and by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Pharo</hi> make Slaues of their Seruants and Subiects.</p>
            <p>Another great argument of this yeares, (or rather of the worldes corruption) is, that all good artes and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning are so contemned and little rewarded, or respected. The Vniuersities, Schooles and Scelestiall Discipline, (which are the causes and fountaines of knowledge) now pilipended, and not regarded. Although God in this last age, hath shewed his good will, and maruellous loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs, especially (in that so great barbarousnesse of our Predecessors, when all artes and liberall learning, was hid, and knowne to fewe, the Latine tongue polluted: the faculties not apprehended) by raysing vp so many lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, which with great study &amp; paines, haue brought all the Scyences to their puritie, and deliuered vnto vs a more easie way, to the attaining the perfect knowledge of them all.</p>

Yet experience teacheth that these guestes that haue of long time beene at the ful, doe now decrease, and grow to be lessend. For not that aduised iudgement, not that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry, not those exercises in studies, are now which haue beene. Euerie man hath his particuler manner of parley, striues to speake in print, hunts after Metaphors, coynes Phrases, and labours extreamely that his words may smell of subtilty, elegancie, and neate deliuerie, in such affected sort, hat for the moste he leaues nothing behinde him, but a sent of verball pride and foolish affection.</p>
