         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I am the ſure foundation, and he that buildeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me ſhall have eternal life; I have mourned for you as one mourneth for her firſt born, and you would not come unto me that you might live: I have knocked and called, and none would hear; therefore will I thunder out my Judgments upon this wicked generation which hath not the fear of God; therefore the wicked ſhall ſee it and tremble: horror and terror, and pain ſhall take hold upon them as upon a woman in travel, and many ſhall cry, but there ſhall be none to deliver them; therefore repent whilſt I give you a day, leaſt you become as fruitleſs trees which cumbers the ground, for every plant that my heavenly Father hath not planted, will be pluckt up by the roots, and therefore repent whilſt I give you a day, for I gave <hi>Ieſabel</hi> a day, and I gave <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> a day, but they would not; therefore mind what I ſhall ſay, and where I do ſpeak be ſtill, and low, and wait in ſilence, and then you ſhall hear a voice ſaying, <hi>this is the way walk in it,</hi> and if any have any deſire to walk in this way, I will be with them, and guide them, and there ſhall you find ſweet paths, and plentious redemption. Therefore for your ſouls health; for it was for the good of your ſouls that I took upon me the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and became the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh, were it not that I loved the world; t<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>erefore I would not have you go aſtray as ſheep without a ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, ſcattered up and down upon every Mountain and Valley, and carried away with every winde of doctrine; but now am I a raiſing up my own ſeed which hath been ſo long under <hi>Pharaoh</hi> the task-maſter, <hi>Oxford</hi> thou task-maſter, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> thou oppreſser which opreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Juſt ſeed within thee, in ſetting up thy own righteouſneſs and wiſdom, which ſhall grow as ragged as an old garment that moths hath eat, and I will make thee know that my righteouſneſs endureth from generation to generation, and ſo for ever. And now let hills be removed, and mountains be daſhed to pieces, and the ſtrong hold be levelled; for a day there is coming that will make the keepers of the houſe tremble, woful and terrible will that day be to the wicked, whilſt the ſtrong-man keeps the houſe all is at peace, but when a ſtronger than he cometh, he then muſt be turned out; <hi>I came not to bring peace but war,</hi> ſaith Chriſt Jeſus, and now turn in your eys from beholding vanity; for that eye looketh from Chriſt, and that nature is accurſed from God, for Chriſt Jeſus is pure, and can behold no vain thing: <hi>Eſau</hi> is accurſed from God, Jacob <hi>have I loved and</hi> Eſau <hi>have I hated, for out of</hi> Abraham <hi>ſhall my name be called.</hi> Death reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth over all men till they be regenerate and born again: and they that be born again of God ſin not, but their ſins are forgiven them; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore repent that your ſins may be forgiven you alſo, the maſter hath given you a tallent to ſee how you will improve it, that you may be found faithful Stewards, that when the Lord ſhall call for that which he hath given you, that when the Lord comes He may ſay, <hi>come yee good and faithful Stewards, enter into your Maſters joy:</hi> but for the wicked, <hi>go ye curſed</hi> and ye that forget God ſhall be caſt into hell. Praiſes, praiſes to the Lord, that he is rayſing up his own Saints to Judg the earth: and many now do witneſs their Judgments true, but to the wicked Judgments are terrible: and none but them cometh to ſee the freſh ſprings of eternal life, but they that live in the life of them that gave them forth, and there they will come to ſee the filthineſs of theſe two wicked Cities, how they ly wallowing in their blood, and their blood ſhall be required at their own hands; for they that come forth of <hi>Oxford</hi> &amp; <hi>Cambridge,</hi> they are ſuch as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was ſent to, to cry woe againſt, greedy dumb-dogs that never have enough, and love greeting in the Market-places, and long prayers in the Synagogues and the upper ſeats at feaſts, and be called of men Maſters; they are filthy bruit-beaſts which maketh my people to err, therefore the ground is curſed for your ſakes: thorns and thiſtles ſhall it bring forth for your ſakes until you return to <hi>Adams</hi> firſt eſtate. And now I have ſhown you the way that you ſhould walk in, take heed to the light that ſhineth in a dark place: light ſhineth in darkneſs, &amp; the darkneſs comprehendeth it not; therefore repent that the darkneſs may be taken away, and ſo become children of the light, and not children of the night, but children of the day; for they that walk in the day ſtumble not, becauſe they have the light with them: but they that walk in the night ſtumble, becauſe they are in darkneſs; And now let the light ſearch you, for Chriſt Jeſus is now ſearching <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with Candles, and not one corner of it muſt go unſearched. Beware of ſeducers that cometh in ſheeps cloathing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves; for ſuch Chriſt Jeſus ſpoke of that ſhould come in the latter days, Oh <hi>Oxford</hi> thou art full of filth, thy Prieſts are all corrupt as braſs and iron is corrupt and cankered, ſo is this City full of hainous ſins thou art full of pride and covetouſneſs, thou art poluted in thy blood, and joyns houſe to houſe, and field to field, until there is no place left for the poor. God exalteth the poor in ſpirit, but the rich he ſendeth empty away; it is the humble and lowly mind trembles at my Word, that I teach, and now ſee in you, and ſearch in you whether you are not in <hi>Cains</hi> ways, murdering and killing the juſt in you, and whiping, and ſtocking them that the Lord hath ſent to you; therefore repent and do ſo no more, take heed and do ſo no more, leaſt I render my plagues double on thy head; and when the book of conſcience is opened then ſhalt thou witneſs this to be true; therefore remember that thou waſt forewarned in thy life time, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wait in ſilence till the day dawn, and the day-ſtar ariſe in your hearts, then will you come to witneſs ſweet ſprings, freſh ones of eternal life; but for the wicked they be like the raging Sea that toſseth to and fro, that caſteth up nothing but mire and dirt: your hearts are full of dirt, and filth, thy pride ſhall become as filthy rags upon the dunghil; therefore ſit down and bethink thee what thou art, thou art but duſt and aſhes: and cannot I kill and make alive, cannot I caſt down and raiſe up, ſpread abroad and bring together: yea, my hands have done all theſe things; I am a gathering all my ſheep together where they have been ſcattered in this dark and cloudy day, I will bring them from under <hi>Pharaoh</hi> that they may have one Maſter, one Shephard, and one ſheepfold; the true Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hard will lay down his life for his ſheep: but the hireling will fly when perſecution comes; and therefore will I gather my ſheep out of their mouths, and he that hath an ear let him hear; and therefore will I pour out my Iudgments upon them, to cut down and burn up &amp; to deſtroy; for it is to the cutting down of pride, of filth, of covetouſnes voluptuouſnes, and all wicked ways, &amp; what delight is in the pride of life? If thy conſcience accuſe thee, what peace canſt thou have? therefore have I ſent light into the world, but men love darkneſs rather then light, and there is their condemnation. Chriſt Jeſus is the eternal life, and they that come to witneſs him in power and glory, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to witneſs Chriſt Jeſus the ſubſtance; and this light will lead thee out of all forms &amp; ſhaddows, and in it will come to ſee all things have an end but Chriſt Jeſus, and he endureth for ever; and therefore build upon him that endureth for ever, build not upon the ſand, for the waves beating to and fro, they bring the ſand into the Sea and ſo the builder looſeth his work, and he that waiteth upon me ſhall not wa<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

I will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Judgments upon the head of the wicked, and all the world ſhall ſee the Glory of God; for he is ariſing in his Glory to Judg the earth, with righteous Judgment and equity will he Judg the earth, and the wicked ſhall ſee it &amp; tremble; and now am I looking for the corn &amp; wine &amp; oyl I gave to feed the poor, but you have ſpent it upon your luſts; the whole Creation groans under you, for your evil deeds &amp; corrupt language: in <hi>Cains</hi> nature you are, and death ſpeaketh of the fame of God. Powerful, Powerful is the God of Glory in all his works his ways paſt finding out, and to them that live in Chriſt Jeſus, they know the mind and will of God their guide and keeper; but to the wicked he is a deſtroyer, to deſtroy their wicked ways with fire and with a ſword to cut down the fruitleſs branches; for what is the wild grape-tree good for? men cannot make any Inſtruments of the wood; therefore it is good for nothing but to be caſt into the fire: ſo ſhall the wicked; for Tophet is prepared of old for them that will not obey Gods Word, and his ſervants, but obey ſin and Satan; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will I pour out my ſeven vials upon the ſeat of the beaſt, the wicked beaſt is in every wicked heart, and therefore ſink down &amp; wait and ſee how thy ſoul lyeth in death, drowned in filth, ſmothered in wickedneſs; therefore repent that that which preſseth down thy ſoul may be taken away, for the ſoul is mine, and I deſire nothing of any but my own, and that with advantage; for he is the ſloathful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant that improveth not his Maſters goods; &amp; therefore from him that hath a little, that little he hath ſhall be taken away &amp; given to him that hath moſt, and he that hath an ear let him hear: and while you have time prize it; Remember you are warned in your life time, and all left without excuſe.</p>
