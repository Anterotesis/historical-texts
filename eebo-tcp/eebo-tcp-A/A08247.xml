            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Such, whose fame goes still before them to dilate their actes, craue no

            <p>Knowing therefore your eminent knowledge in matter of learning, and that you are a Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in all the faculties of the minde: in all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection I beare this worke to your worthy iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: presuming, in the want of mine owne worth, to shield the same vnder your worthines, and to passe it vnder your patronage, against the sowre humours of such, as still doing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, yet value themselues by detracting from others; for <hi>Liuore nihil sublimius,</hi> and dogges euen by Nature must barke against the Moone.</p>

altogether insenscible.</p>

The office of <hi>Pannicles</hi> (which are little skins made of <hi>Sinewes</hi> and <hi>Ligaments)</hi> is to defend, and keepe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the members, and to impart (vnto many of them) sence: as to the heart, lyuer, lunges, Splene, and and kidnies.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The <hi>Filaments</hi> serue to draw nourishment (being as it were slender threeds) and some to retayne the same, and expell what is superfluous.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The <hi>Veynes,</hi> are thinne and slender pipes, carying the thicker blood, and haue their beginning of the Liuer.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The <hi>Arteries</hi> are pipes of thicke and strong skinne, which carry the vitall Spirit through the body, and proceede from the heart, they are also called <hi>Pulses. The veynes, and Arteries are ioyned together, to the intent the Arteries might receaue nourishment from the blood, and the blood in the veynes warmth from the vitall Spirits in the Arteries.</hi>

                     <hi>Sorrow</hi> is cold and dry, therefore it is most incident to old folkes and melancholy persons, which are cold and dry.</p>
