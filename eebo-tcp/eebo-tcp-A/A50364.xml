            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THe conſtitution of our Engliſh Monarchy is by wiſe men eſteemed one of the beſt in Europe, as well for the ſtrength and honour of the Prince, as the ſecuritie and freedome of the people; and the Baſis, on which both are foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, is the conveniencie of that great Councell, the High Court of Parliament.</p>
               <p>Without which neither can the Prince enjoy that honour and felicitie, which <hi>Philip de Commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> a forrainer, ſo much admires, where he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers what advantages the Kings of England have by that Repreſentative Body of their people, by whoſe aſſiſtance in any action they can neither want meanes, or loſe reputation. Nor on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, can the people have any poſſibilitie of pleading their owne rights and liberties. For in the <hi>Interim</hi> betweene Parliaments, the People are too ſcattered and confuſed a body, to appeare in vindication of their proper intereſts; and by too long abſence of ſuch Aſſemblies they would loſe all.

               <p>The People inſenſibly loſe their power for
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65823:3"/>
want of uſing it: for ſo it happens, that what all ſhould look after, no man does; what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to all, no man thinks his owne charge.</p>
               <p>And in that <hi>Interim</hi> it happens, that thoſe <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates Regni</hi> (as he ſpeaks) who under the Prince are entruſted with government, meaning Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellours, Judges, and other great Magiſtrates, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through feare, flatterie, or private corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, doe often betray the peoples rights to the Prince.</p>
               <p>The ſtate of government ſtanding thus; If di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered times happen to be (as our Chronicles have ſhewed ſome) where by diſſention betweene Prince and People, the Kingdomes ruine hath beene endangered, it doth not ſo much prove that the Engliſh government is not the beſt, as that the beſt government may be abuſed. For in everie Monarchy, how limited ſoever, the Prince his perſon is inveſted with ſo much Majeſtie, that it would ſeeme a mockerie in State, if there were no conſiderable power entruſted into his hands; yea, ſo much as that, if he be bad or weak, he may endanger the ruine of the Kingdome; ſo neceſſary is it for all humane ordinances, how wiſe ſo ever, to leave ſomewhat to Chance, and to have alwayes need of recourſe to God, for his aſſiſting or curing Providence.</p>
               <p>And though the Kingdome of England, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the government thereof, will be as hardly brought into a confuſion, as any in Europe; yet there is no warrant againſt the poſſibilitie of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:65823:4"/>For it was ever heretofore ſeene, that our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments were rather a ſtrength and advantage to an honourable wiſe Prince, than a remedy againſt a bad or weak one; or, if wee change the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, they were rather an excellent diet to preſerve a good raigne in ſtrength, than Phyſick to cure a bad one; and therefore have been as much loved by ſound and healthy Princes, as loathed by them that were out of temper; the later having thought them a depreſſion of their dignitie: as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer have eſteemed them an advantage to their ſtrength. So that in ſuch times only the true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of that great Councell hath been percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by England, and admired by forreine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors: in the other times it was, that thoſe wittie complaints have been in faſhion (as Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi> ſpeaks of a bad time) that Princes in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments are leſſe than they ſhould be, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects greater. But on the contrarie, that they have been an advantage to Kings, the conſtant <hi>Series</hi> of our hiſtorie will ſhew. 1. By thoſe great at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements which they have enabled our wiſe Kings to make, who were moſt conſtant in calling them, and conſenting to them. 2. That no one Prince was ever yet happie without the uſe of them.</p>
               <p>It may therefore ſeeme a Paradox, that any Prince ſhould diſaffect that which is ſo high an advantage to him, and a great wonder, that ſome Kings of England, not vicious in their diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, nor verie ſhallow in their underſtandings,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65823:4"/>
have ſo much kicked againſt Parliaments. And that ſuch have been (before we ſhew what reaſons may be of it) ſee the characters of ſome Princes, whoſe ſucceſſe and fortunes are knowne to all that read the hiſtories, as they are delivered by <hi>Polydore Virgil,</hi> who in his ſixteenth book ſpeaks thus of <hi>Henry</hi> the third: <hi>Fuit ingenio miti, animo magis nobili quàm magno, cultor religionis, adverſus inopes liberalis.</hi> Hee was of a gentle nature, a mind ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther noble than great, a lover of religion, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall to the poore.</p>
               <p>In his eighteenth Book thus of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond; <hi>Fuit illi natura bona, ingenium mite, quem primò juvenili errore actum in leviora vitia inciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, tandem in graviora malorum conſuetudines &amp; conſilia traxerunt. Non deerant illi animi vires, ſi repudiatis malis ſuaſoribus illas juſtè exercuiſſet.</hi> He was of a good nature and mild diſpoſition, who firſt by the errours and raſhneſſe of youth falling into ſmall faults, was afterwards drawne into grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by the ſocietie and counſels of wicked men. There was not wanting in him a ſtrength of mind, if avoyding evill counſell, hee could have made a juſt uſe of it.</p>
               <p>And in his twentieth Book, thus of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond; <hi>Fuit in illo ſpiritus non vilis, quem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociorum improbitas, &amp; inſulſitas extinxit.</hi> He was of a ſpirit not low or baſe, but ſuch as was quite deſtroyed by the wickedneſſe and folly of unhappy Conſociates.</p>
               <p>A reaſon of this accident may be, that their
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65823:5"/>
ſoules, though not vicious, have not been ſo large<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor their affections ſo publike, as their great cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling hath required; but being too much manci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pat d to private fancies and unhappie Favourites, and long flattered in thoſe affections under the ſpecious name of firmneſſe in friendſhip, (not being told that the adaequate object of a Prince his love ſhould be the whole people, and that they who receive publike honour, ſhould returne a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall love and care) they have too much negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the Kingdome, and grow at laſt afraid to look their faces in ſo true a glaſſe as a Patliament, and flying the remedy, encreaſe the diſeaſe, till it come to that unhappie height, that rather than acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge any unjuſt action, they ſtrive for an unjuſt power to give it countenance, and ſo by a long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence become hardly reconcilable to a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarie way.</p>
               <p>Such Princes (though it may ſeeme ſtrange) have been a greater affliction to this Kingdome, than thoſe who have been moſt wicked, and more incurable for theſe reaſons. 1. They have not been ſo conſcious to themſelves of great crimes; and therefore not ſo apt to be ſenſible of what they have beene accidentally made to doe againſt their people by evill counſell, whoſe poyſon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves did not perfectly underſtand. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are more prone to ſuſpect the people, as unkind to them, than themſelves as faultie, and ſo the more hardly drawne to repent their actions, or meet heartily with a Parliament. 2. The ſecond
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65823:5"/>
reaſon is from the People, who naturally looke with honour upon the Prince, and when they find none, or few perſonall vices in him (not conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that the true vertues of Princes have a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger extent than thoſe of private men) will more hardly be brought to think, though themſelves feele, and ſuffer for it, that he is faultie; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſometimes (which would hardly be beleeved, if experience had not ſhewed it) the People have been ſo raſh as that to maintaine for the King an unjuſt Prerogative, which themſelves underſtand not, they have to their owne ruine, and the Kings too (as it hath after proved) deſerted that great Councell whom themſelves have choſen, and by whom only they could be preſerved in their juſt rights; untill too late, for the Kings happineſſe and their owne, they have ſeene and repented their great folly.</p>
               <p>Such a deſertion was too ſadly feene at the end of that Parliament of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, where the two <hi>Spencers</hi> were baniſhed, and the tragicall effects that followed, when the King found ſo great a partie both of Clergie and Laitie, as enabled him to call home againe his baniſhed Favourites, and proved fatall to ſo many Parliamentarie Lords, as the like execution of Nobilitie had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver before beene ſeene in England: over whoſe graves the People afterwards wept when it was too late, and proceeded further in their revenge, than became the dutie aud allegeance of Subjects.</p>
               <p>It is therefore a great miſ-fortune to England,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65823:6"/>
and almoſt a certaine calamitie, when the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of government have been let grow ſo long, as that for their cure they muſt need a long Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For there are no wayes, how juſt, how mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate ſoever they be, which that great Councell can take (if they go far enough to make the cure) but will provoke, either by the meanes, or the length of them, the Prince his impatience, or the peoples inconſtancie.</p>
               <p>For the firſt; the Delinquents muſt needs be many and great<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and thoſe employed, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance highly favoured by him, beſides the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion which is made upon his judgement by their ſufferings, and that will be one reaſon of his impatience.</p>
               <p>Another is, that many prerogatives which were not indeed inherent in the Crowne, but ſo thought by the Prince, and by him and his bad Councell long abuſed, to the prejudice of the People, with ſome ſeeming advantage to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (though well weighed they brought none) are then after a long ſufferance called in queſtion.</p>
               <p>For the People are uſed to entruſt kind Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with many of their owne rights and priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and never call for them againe till they have beene extremely abuſed. But at ſuch a time to make all cleare after ſo long a reckoning (and thoſe long reckonings in State being commonly fatall; for Parliaments have ſeldome beene diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continued, but by ſuch Princes whoſe govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the <hi>Interim</hi> have been verie illegall) they
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65823:6"/>
uſually queſtion ſo much, as that the Prince thinks himſelfe hardly dealt withall, ſuch a Prince as we ſpoke of, who not bad in himſelfe, but long miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by wicked counſell, was not enough ſenſible of the injuries he had done.</p>
               <p>The ſecond obſtacle that ſuch Parliaments may find is the Peoples inconſtancie; and what age is not full of ſuch examples which before we name, let us conſider whether there be any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for it? This perchance may be one, that the People naturally are lovers of noveltie, affecting with greedineſſe everie change, and againe loathing it when it ceaſes to be a noveltie. Long-diſconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued and reforming Parliaments ſeemes to carrie the face of a change of government, and thoſe things may then happen which doe in the ſhift of Princes, that ſome people may for a while flatter themſelves with new and ſtrange hopes, that prove fruſtrate; or elſe with quicker redreſſes of inconvenience, than the great concurrence of ſo many weightie buſineſſes can poſſibly admit, how induſtrious ſoever that great Councell be, diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with ſo great a varietie; and the people after ſome time ſpent, grow wearie againe of what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſo long had wiſhed to ſee. Beſides, the people are more and more poyſoned daily by the diſcourſes of the friends, kindred, and retainers to ſo many great Delinquents, as muſt needs be at ſuch a Parliament: who, though they be no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable partie in reſpect of the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, yet ply their particular intereſts
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65823:7"/>
with more eagerneſſe than moſt doe the publike. They ſubtilly perſwade the people, that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Parliament does againſt thoſe great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents is aimed againſt the Kings honour, and that he is wounded thorow their ſides. And this opinion is ſomewhat furthered, when the People fee how many prerogatives of the Prince (as wee ſaid before) are after long enjoying called in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. So that by this meanes their inconſtancie ſeemes to be grounded upon loyaltie to the King, and they (perchance with honeſt, but deceived hearts) grow wearie of the great Councell of the Land.</p>
               <p>Another reaſon may be, that the Prince him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe averſe from ſuch a Parliament, for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons aforeſaid, can find power enough to retard their proceedings, and keep off the cure of State ſo long, till the People tired with expectation of it, have by degrees forgot the ſharpneſſe of thoſe diſeaſes, which before required it.</p>
               <p>By this meanes at laſt, accidentally a miracle hath been wrought after a long Parliament, which is, that the People have taken part with the great Delinquents againſt the Parliament, for no other reaſon, than becauſe thoſe Delinquents had done them more wrong than the Parliament could ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly redreſſe. And ſo the multitude of thoſe great Delinquents crimes hath turned to their owne advantage.</p>
               <p>But in ſuch reforming Parliaments, upon whom ſo much buſineſſe lyes, not only the inconſtancie
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65823:7"/>
of the people hath been ſeene in hiſtorie, but the unſtedfaſtneſſe of the Repreſentative Body it ſelfe: and the diſtractions of that Aſſembly, whilſt they forſake each other under ſo great a burden, have let that burden fall diſhonourably to the ground. The moſt unhappie inſtance in this caſe, was that Parliament of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond begun at Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter, and adjourned to Shrewsbury in the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth yeare of his reigne; a Parliament that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged their truſt the worſt of any that I read of; where there was as much need of conſtancie and magnanimitie as ever was, to redreſſe thoſe great diſtempers which were then growne upon the State; and as much miſchiefe enſued by their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault, both upon Prince and People, which might have beene well prevented, and his happineſſe wrought together with their owne (in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of beſt Wtiters) if they had timely and conſtantly joyned together in maintaining the true rights of Parliament, and reſiſting the ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall deſires of their ſeduced King. But being fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally diſtracted, the major part of Lords and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops wrought upon by the King, and the Houſe of Commons too far prevailed with by <hi>Buſhy</hi> the Speaker, and his Inſtruments, they utterly deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Common-wealth, and looking only upon the Kings preſent deſire, aſſented to ſuch things as made the Prerogative a thing boundleſſe; that he himſelfe (as the Storie reports) was heard glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying to ſay, That there was no free and abſolute Monarch in Europe but himſelfe. Upon which,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65823:8"/>
the ſame bad counſell which had before brought him out of love with Parliaments, brought him to as great an abuſe of that power which hee had now gotten over a Parliament. And then follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the blank Charters, and other horrid extorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, beſides the ſuffering of ſome Lords, whom the people moſt loved; and ſhortly after, by a ſad conſequence, his owne ruine. Nor doe wee read that any of thoſe Lords, who under colour of loyaltie and love (as they called it) to his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, had trodden downe the power and priviledge of a Parliament under his feet, had afterwards ſo much loyaltie to him, as to defend his Crowne and Perſon againſt the force of an Uſurper, who without any reſiſtance or contradiction unjuſtly aſcended the Royall Throne: the ſad occaſion of that miſerable and cruell civill war, which in the following ages ſo long afflicted the Kingdome of England. This was the worſt example of any Parliament; but in other times, though bad too, they have proved better Phyſick than any other earthly wayes or meanes could be; yet their greateſt vertue and excellencie is ſeene, when they have been uſed as a diet by honourable and juſt Princes, ſuch as this Nation hath been often bleſt with; and ſuch who have thought it no diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or depreſſion of their dignitie, to be ruled by the ſway of that great Councell, than a wiſe guider of a ſhip would think it to follow his Compaſſe, or any Mathematician to be directed by his neceſſarie rules and inſtruments.</p>
