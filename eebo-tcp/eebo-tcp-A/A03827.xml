         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Will vse na vther Epistle Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catorie
of thir my litle treatises
(gude Christian Reidar) saue
onely this vnto thee, to quhais
knawledge thay sall come: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do I seek ony praise, thanks
or recompense of men, for ony
thing that I haue done. The on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thing that I craue for my labour, is, that the praise &amp;
glory heirof may be giuen vnto God, and that the com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>moditie
may redound to the members of his Kirk. Now,
to declair schortly the circumstances, and occasion of
my writing: the trueth is, that being in great affliction,
and assaulted with many temptations, (as the godly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
runnes to God in time of trouble) I took purpose to
compose somewhat to his glory, and to the comfort &amp;
edification of gude men. And the subject quhilk I chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
wes, how to resist the temptations of pouertie, sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
schame, and sorrowes of this lyfe: Siklyke, of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie
of the life to come, and certaine discourses in
praise of the mercie, justice, power, and providence of
God. Al these I conceived, first by a general notion, and
for helping of my memory, I set them downe in writ, in
maner of a table, or memoriall: ever awayting the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
quhen, and how I micht followe them forth in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
as I had devised. But I was so hindred and drawne
away with warldly affaires, that mair nor the space of
<pb facs="tcp:19417:3"/>
half a ȝeir, I came but litle speid in my interprised wark
Quhill at last, in the ȝeir 1592. it pleased God to visite
me with a Feuer alterne, quhilk vulgarly wee call the
Excesse, In sik sorte, that all warldly cares and impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
were remooued, and my mind altogether setled
on the seruice of my God. Neuertheles, my infirmitie
was so great, that during the time of my sicknes (quhilk
lasted thre Moneths) I wes vnable to compose or write
any thing: saue only at sometime to read the Scripturs,
or cause them to be redde to me: Alwaies, being viuely
touched with the Lords rod, It brocht forth gud effects
in me: For thereby I was farre humbled, and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
great feeling baith of mine awin sinn, and of Gods
mercie: my cheif exercise wes to meditate on the lawe
of the Lord, and to clenge my defiled heart. But sa sone
as the Feuer began to slaik, and I to convalesse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sa soone
did I search out my memoriall, and put my hand to the
pen, earnestly prosecuting my interrupted warke. And
beginning at the resistance of temptations, I thocht
thay micht all be commodiously comprehendit vnder
a generall treatise of affliction: quhilk by reason I had
laitly before tasted: It micht appear that by gods grace
I micht write the more feelingly thereof. Hauing then
accomplished the first treatise, I proceeded without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
to the second: And in the meane season, while I wes
in hand thairwith: behold, I contracted ane vther hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie
disease: even a swelling, and a defluction of a putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
humor in my legges, and vther partes of my bodie
(quhilk commonly followis that kind of Fever) So that
I was thereby made vnable for ony trauell: But for the
maist part, and by reason of the cold supervenient win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
I was tyed to the bed, mair nor the space of sax Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths.
This made baith my self, and the time mair pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for the accomplishing of the wark begunne: For I
was grim, and brocht wondrous lowe with paine in my
<pb facs="tcp:19417:3"/>
flesh: And being seperat from the companie of men, my
delectation for the maist part wes, to bee occupied in
contemplation, in composing, and serving of my God.
So hauing finished the second treatise, I proceid it to
the discourses or praises: And last, for coronation of my
litle wark, to the effect that the inward trouble of the
minde might be alsweill discouered, and resisted, as the
externall troubles of the warld, I beganne a treatise of
Conscience: all the quhilk treatises, it pleased the Lord
to prosper and accomplish in the waik hands of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant,
as thou may see in halfe a ȝeirs space: quhilk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out-runne, the extremitie of my paine did cease, &amp;
the Lord from day to day restored me: In sik sorte, that
appearantly, he had casten me on the bed, to the effect,
that he micht warke this his wark in me: Nowe as to the
treatise of affliction, it may perhaps appeir, through the
multitude and prolixitie of egressions, to be lesse me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodicall
nor the rest: But I hope gif you marke it nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly,
and richtly discerne the digressions, from the
lineal point of the treatise, as they are set downe in the
Argument thereof, thou sall find it not without cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
and the amplification not without profite. The
treatises of praise, and of the lise to come, are a large
field: by reason quhairof many thinges may bee eiked
thairto. But the treatise of Conscience, because it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
in Chapters, I esteeme it to be of best methode,
and maist solide doctrine. Finally, I wil assure thee, that
I neuer entred to meditate on this my little warke, nor
put my hand to the pen, without earnest invocation on
the Name of the Lord, for the assistance of his spirite,
That I micht vtter the wordes of knowledge, and of
trueth, to his glory, and to the comfort of my brethren.
Therefore, that I may end, as I beganne, whatsoeuer
comfort or instructioun thou receiue (my Brother) of
these treatises, giue the praise thereof only to the Lord,
<pb facs="tcp:19417:4"/>
and to his vndefiled Lambe Christ Iesus, seing to them,
all glory justly apperteinis for euer. God graunt you
may be na lesse mooued in the reiding, nor I was in the
writing of these treatises: the grace and peace of our
Lord Iesus Christ bee with thy spirite. Amen. At my
chamber the 26. of September. 1593.</p>

be the phrase of speaking, quhilke

it is to be vnderstand, that <hi>Conscience</hi> is
na mair a substance, nor the thocht, the

are: For man consistis onely of twa sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall

               <p>Now the difference betuix Knawledg

I know quhat the commandementis
of God ar, quhilk he hes geuin vs to keip,
This cannot as ȝit be callit <hi>Conscience,</hi>
for it is onlie a naked knawledge quhait
na deid is done: Bot quhen I knowe that
I haue brokin thir Commaundementis
quhilk God hes geuin me, thair arrysis
<hi>Conscience,</hi> ȝe ane euill <hi>Conscience,</hi> that
is to say, ane euill knawledge of my selfe
through the deid that I haif done: Again
I knaw it repenteth me, that I haif violat
the commandement of God, and that I
beleif that Iesus Christ hes satisfy it for
my offence: Heir arrysis the testimonie
of a gude <hi>Conscience.</hi> Siklike, I knaw sum
men that hes committit greuous sinnis:
That hes nathing to do with my <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
for it is ane vther manis deid: Bot
quhen I knaw that I haif committit ane
haynous offence my selfe; that twichis
my <hi>Conscience.</hi> Againe, I knaw, and am
certainly perswadit, that Abraham wes a
faithfull man and familiar with GOD:
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:19417:6"/>
Neuerthelesse, this knawledg cannot be
callit <hi>Conscience:</hi> Bot gif I woulde deny
that, quhilk I knaw, &amp; quhairof I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
perswadit, in sa doing, I suld haif
ane euill <hi>Conscience:</hi> For in a word, thair
mon be euer a deid done, a word spoken,
or a thocht consaifit, annixit, and joynit
with the knawledge, to make it arrise in
<hi>Conscience.</hi> The vther difference quhilk I
mark betuix knawledge, and <hi>Conscience,</hi>
is; that manis knawledge is mair certain,
nor his <hi>Conscience</hi> sumtyme is: For that
quhilk man knawis, hee either compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendis
it with his outward senses, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandis
the causes thairof; either else
hes ane sufficient authoritie and warrant
for him, that it is swa: Bot at sumtyme he
may haif ane euill <hi>Conscience,</hi> quhair he
hes na sufficient warrant for him, saue on
lie a suir perswasioun, and estimatioun
within himselfe, of that thing quhilk is
fals. As for example: hee that estemis it
vnlauchfull to cit of every kinde of meit
indifferentlie at all tymes; Gif hee not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
make na difference in ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:19417:7"/>
of every kinde of meat at all tymes;
hee man haif ane euill <hi>Conscience;</hi> becaus
he dois that thing quhilk hee estemis to
be wrang in his hart, and in sa doing sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth:
Neuertheles, hee can haif na suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
warrand for him, to esteme it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lauchfull
to eit of every kinde of meat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently
at all times, seing it is fals of
itselfe. To conclude, that quhilk the Lord
is to lay to manis charge, and quhairof
man is astrictit to rander account at the
latter day of judgement, it fallis all vnder
<hi>Conscience:</hi> For then every manis <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi>

               <p>THe <hi>Conscience</hi> of man may bee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lit
gude and vpricht, thre manner of
wayis; First, quhen hee eschewis that
quhilk is euill of it self, ather vpon knaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,

thing is euil quhilk he eschewis. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
quhen he followis that quhilk is gude

assuredly, or being certainlie perswadit
in his hairt, that the thing is gude and
richteous quhilk he dois. Thridly, quhen
he ather dois, or leiffis the thing vndone
that is indifferent of it selfe, that is to say,
neither gude nor euill; and that vpoun
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:19417:9"/>

that the selfe same thing is indifferent

quhair man, ather eschewis that quhilke
is euill, or indifferent of it self: ather else
follow is that quhilk is richteous, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,
vpon ignorance, or vpon acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent:
Thair can be na testimony of a gud
<hi>Conscience</hi> thair: For that quhilk is done
vpon ignorance, is opponit vnto that
quhilk is done vpon knawledge, quhair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<hi>Conscience</hi> mon proceide. In sik
sort, that to mak the testimonie of manis
<hi>Conscience,</hi> gude, baith the deede quhilk

ather knaw perfytlie, or haif a suir per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
in his hart that the thing is gude
or at leist, indifferent quhilk he dois. The
difference quhilk I make betwixt knaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and a suir perswasion, is this: that
knawledg is groundit vpon a suir autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
and warrand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> out of the worde of
God: and that suir perswasion, is onely
a constant opinioun consauit in manis
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:19417:10"/>
hairt, that a thing is sa, or not sa, without
ony certaine warrand: Bot foralsmeikle,
as mans <hi>Conscience</hi> can nather beir wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
with him, nor aganis him, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to mans awin knawledge and vnder
standing: hee suld beware that he lippin
not ouer meikle in the testimonie of his
awin <hi>Conscience:</hi> For albeit, al that man
dois aganis his awin <hi>Conscience</hi> be sinn:
Neuertheles, all that is done according
to <hi>Conscience,</hi> is not gude and without
sinne: In respect that mans <hi>Conscience,</hi>
will oftymes certefie him, that the deede
quhilk he dois, is gude of it selfe, quhen it
is euil: And be the contrair, that the deed
quhilk he hes done is euil of it self, quhen
it is gude and richteous. As for example
the Iewis quhen thay crucify it our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Iesus Christ, were perswadit in their
<hi>Conscience,</hi> that thay had not crucified
the Sonne of God; and ȝit thay were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saifit:
Sicklyk, na doubt but some of the

that thay do wel in making thair
supplications vnto the sauls of the saints
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:19417:10"/>
departit; and ȝit thay are dissauit be thair
<hi>Conscience.</hi> Heirfoir, seing the testemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
of mans <hi>Conscience,</hi> is oftymes dissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uabill
and fals: In the thingis, quhairby
the doing, or not doing of thame, may
follow sin; hee aucht to haif his warrand
out of the word of God, and not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide
in the testimony of his <hi>Conscience.</hi>
Notwithstanding, in thingis indifferent;
as to marrie, or leif vnmarried: to weare
costly apparell on the Sabboth day, or
not to weare it: to vse, or not to vse mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
exercitioun of the bodie; or til eat
meat with weschen or vnweschin hands:
In doing of thir and siklike thingis, a suir
perswasion of thame, that thay ar things
indifferent, is sufficient to saif man from
sinne, without ony farther warrant: But
hee that doubtis whether hee haif done
weill or euill in following, or eschewing
ony thing, albeit the thing be indifferent
of it self, ȝit he sinnis: becaus hee hes na
testimonie nor assurance of his <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
for that quhilk he dois, quhilk every
man aucht to haif in all his actions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:19417:11"/>
As concerning the nature and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of a gude <hi>Conscience;</hi> It wilbe peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abill,
it will sometimes haue remorse, &amp;
sometimes it wil be woundit &amp; troublit.
Mans <hi>Conscience</hi> may be callit peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bill,
twa manner of wayis: The ane is,
quhen his <hi>Conscience</hi> giffis him rest, and
accusis him not, but allowis and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis
all that hee dois, as weill done. This
kind of peace is not onely proper to the
gude <hi>Conscience,</hi> and weill doer, but also
to the euill <hi>Conscience</hi> and euil doer: For
he that committis wickitnes ather vpon
ignorance, or vpon a perswasion that he
dois well; or hee that hes the hart harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and is not mouit nor troublit with
the euill quhilk hee dois; that man (I say)
will haif sum tyme peace of <hi>Conscience</hi>
for a time: although in the end, the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
and torment of his <hi>Conscience</hi> wil
be horrible and great. In consideration
whereof, it wald bee diligently marked,
that mans <hi>Conscience.</hi> dois not alwaies
accuse, nor trouble him, sa sone as the sin
and wickitnes is committit: Na, na, he wil
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:19417:11"/>
haue inward peace of minde for a time,
his <hi>Conscience</hi> will flatter him, the eies
of his minde wil be blindit, and his hart
will be shut vp: during the quhilke tyme
his <hi>Conscience</hi> will be peaceabill, he will
haif inward rest of the minde, and lief in
careles securitie: Bot quhen the lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to chop, to appeall the <hi>Conscience,</hi>
&amp; to open the eies of the hairt, that man
may see the vglines of his awin sin: Then
begins the <hi>Conscience</hi> to accuse, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne,
and to torment man with terribil
prickis, with fearfull terrors, and intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
paine. Thairfoir, quhen this kinde
of peace proceidis from knawledge, that
is, quhen man hes asuir warrand of the
word of God for that quhilk he dois, then
is it gude, and the <hi>Conscience</hi> vpricht: But
quhair it lacketh that warrand of Gods
worde, it is dangerous, &amp; not to be lipnit
in: For as I haif said, the wickit mans <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi>
will flatter him, and beare him
false witnesse, quhairby he wil haif peace
and rest for a time. The vther kinde of
peace is, quhen after greate trouble of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:19417:12"/>
the spreit and <hi>Conscience,</hi> through the
sicht of mans sinne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and of the wrath of
God aganis sinne; man obtainis inward
peace and rest of his <hi>Conscience,</hi> by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
mercy throgh Iesus Christ,
and by the assurance quhilk the spreit of
God giues to the spreit of man, that his
sinnes ar forgiuen him. This is the true
peace of <hi>Conscience,</hi> and is onely proper
to the chosen children of God.</p>
               <p>Mairouer, the gude <hi>Conscience</hi> will
remord and bite: that is to say, it will oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
call to remembrance the sinnes,
quhilk man hes committit, and will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse,
and prick him with an inward pain
thairfoir: This remorse and byting, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
a quality that is common, baith to the
gude and euill <hi>Conscience:</hi> Bot the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwixt the remorse of the godly
and of the wickit, is notable and greate:
For that remorse quhilk the godly hath,
bringis a godly dolour with it for the sin
committit, makes man to seik the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
of the inward prick and paine quhilk
he hes, even to humble himself befoir his
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:19417:12"/>
God by earnest repentance, and fervent
praier, quhairby hee findes releefe and
comfort: But the wickit man, albeit hee
haue the remorse and paine of his <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science:</hi>
Neverthelesse, hee is not mouit
with ony godly sorrowe, neither seiks he
the remedie for the paine, nor ressauis
ony releif or comfort from aboue. Heir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I mon say, that the remorse and by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
is the qualitie of a gude <hi>Conscience:</hi>
I say not, that the deede is gude, quhilk
makis man to haue remorse of <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
for that is sinne: But I say, that to
haue remorse of <hi>Conscience</hi> for the sinne,
it is gude, and is proper to the children
of God: For, without remorse thair can
be no repentance: And seeing that the
fragilitie of mans nature is so great, that
he can not abstaine from sinne so long
as he is in this life, ȝe the maist just &amp; vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richt
man fallis oftymes euery day; and
the estait of a true Christians life, is but a
continual falling and arrysing: It is maist
necessary that the <hi>Conscience</hi> of man be
exercisit with a frequent remorse: For as
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:19417:13"/>
I haue saide, without it, repentance can
not be, &amp; it makes man to seik the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
and to finde releif and heauenly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solatioun.</p>
               <p>Finally, the gude <hi>Conscience</hi> will be
sometime wounded, and troubled: and
whereby? euen by the commemoration
and consideration of the sinnes quhilke
man hes committed: Ȝe not onely the
conscience, but also the spreit and saull,
and all the functions thairof, and the hail
estait of the richteous man, by the sicht
of sinn will be sair vexit and troublit. But
meikill mair the spreit and saull of the
wickit man, through the sicht of sin will
be tormentit, considdering that the same
turnis in the end, to his vtter confusion:
Quhairas the trouble of the richteous
saull salbe turned into glaidnes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound
to aeternall saluation: But of this
trouble of the spreit and <hi>Conscience,</hi> wee

quhilk may be committed aganis knaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:
A sinne according to knawledge,
and a sinne done vpon ignorance. Al thir
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:19417:14"/>
three kindes of sinnes are accessorie, and
annexit to ane euill <hi>Conscience.</hi> As to
the first, quhen man knawis, or is suirly
perswadit with himselfe, quhat is wrang,
and ȝit dois it: And quhat is richt, and ȝit
leifis it vndone; he then sinnis aganis his

of sin; and the worst kinde of <hi>Conscience,</hi>
quhilk is guiltie of wilfull errour: In sik
sort, that albeit the deid be gude, or indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
of it selfe, If man esteeme, and be

ȝit dois it: It is euill to him, and in doing
thairof he sinnis and offendis: For all that
is done aganis knawledge, or aganis the

thee tell me, where hes thou sik a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
giuen thee of God? or thinks
thou, that thou maist transgresse the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
of the most high, either by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that quhilk he hes forbidden thee to
do, or by leauing that vndone quhilk he
hes commandit thee to do; &amp; then cloke
thy sinne with thy intention, by saying,
that thou did al for the best, that thy pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
and intention was gude, and that
man is iudged according to his intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
Na, na, thy intention sall be na rele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant
defence vnto thee, in that respect:
For thou perverts that gude sentence. I
graunt, where thy intention agreis with
the will of God, quhen thou intends, and
endevours thy self to please God, and to
keep his Commandements: The Lord,
for his sone Iesus Christs sake, wil accept
thy gude intention, and be well pleased
with the gude affection of thy heart, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
(throw thy awin fragilitie, or vther
externall impediments) thou neuer exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
nor performe thy intentioun. But
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:19417:15"/>
quhair thy actions are repugnant to the
ordinance of God, of necessitie thy zeale
mon be blind, &amp; thy intention euil, how
gude soeuer it appeir in thine awin eies:
neither sal it serue for a lawful excuse vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thee, but for a point of dittay to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
thee, in the day of the Lords rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
judgement: For when the Lord sal
lay downe his Law, as a rule before thee,
sall open the blinded eies of thy heart, &amp;
appeale thy <hi>Conscience:</hi> Thou sall then
know, and confesse, that the Lord suld be
served according to his holy statutes &amp;
commandements, and not according to
thy foolish braine and conceits, nor ȝit
after the traditions of men. The thrid
sorte of sinne, quhairby the <hi>Conscience</hi> of
man is damnifyit &amp; hurt, is nether com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittit
aganis knawledge, nor ȝit vpon a
perswasion and pretence of weil doing:
But is done on mere stupiditie and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
As when man either is in doute,
whether the thing be gude or euill, that
he dois: ather els is altogidder negligent
and careles quhat he dois; nocht taking
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:19417:16"/>
heed, nor trying whether his actions be
just, or vnjust. Heir it wald appeare, that
this kinde of sinne can nocht touch the
<hi>Conscience:</hi> In respect, that <hi>Conscience</hi> is a
knawledge of a deid done; but ignorance
is opponit to knawledge; and therefore
cannot concerne, nor corrupt the <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi>
The trueth is, that all kinde of sinne
infects the <hi>Conscience</hi> and saull of man:
And seeing that all iniquitie done vpon
ignorance, is sin: For neither ignorance
negligence, rashnes, nor waiknes, can be
a just defence and excuse to sinne: Thair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
it mon follow, that sinne committit
vpon ignorance, corrupts and infects the
saull and <hi>Conscience.</hi> Mairouer, albeit the
wicked man wil be sumtime careles, and
ignorant of the qualitie of his deedes,
whether thay be gude or euil, and sa wil
haue peace of <hi>Conscience</hi> for a season: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheles,
hee cannot be ignorant quhat
he hes done, at the time when the fact is
committed: Yea, although he were baith
forgetfull quhat he had done, and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the qualitie of the deid: ȝit quhen
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:19417:16"/>
it sall please the Lord to knocke at the
doore of his <hi>Conscience,</hi> and to illuminate
his dull vnderstanding: he sal then baith
haue his deids recent in memory, &amp; sall
clearlie vnderstand, that thay ar euil and
wicked, quhairvpon his awin <hi>Conscience</hi>
sall beir witnes against him. Heirfore, to
sinne vpon ignorance, It is a dangerous
thing. For wee aucht neither to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
nor to doubt of the qualitie of our
actiouns; but suld haue assurance of our
<hi>Consciences</hi> for all that we do; &amp; our <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences</hi>
the assurance of Gods word: The
quhilk assurance all men may haue, that
delights to bee exercised in the Lawe of
the Lord: For this is maist certaine, that
there is nathing quhilk may serue to the
salvation of man, but it is reveiled by the
word of God, and set downe in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
And all that the Lord hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
vs to do, is gude and richteous:
All that he hes defendit, and forbidden,
is euill and wicked: And all that is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit
and forbidden be the word of God,
may be saifly done without sinne or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence:
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:19417:17"/>
providing, that man do it vppon
knawledge, &amp; doubt not of his awin do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Thus then we see, that by these di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
kindes of sinnes, the <hi>Conscience,</hi> and
saull of man is infected and corrupted:
And by the sicht &amp; consideration thair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
is grievously wounded; quhairvpon
there arrysis a great remors, and trouble,
in the spreit and <hi>Conscience:</hi> For quhen it
pleaseth the Lord to let man see the vg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines
of his own sinne, his <hi>Conscience</hi> then
beginnes to accuse him, and to byte like
a worme, inwardly in the heart: and for
that cause is callit, a biting or remording
<hi>Conscience:</hi> The quhilk remorse, gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and biting, is perpetuall in the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
that hes not the grace to seik the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie,
as it was in Cain: But in the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of God it is temporall onely, and is
cured and taken away with blenks of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
comforte. Againe, the perversed
<hi>Conscience</hi> that is opponit vnto this, is
not mooued with remorse, for any wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes
that man can commit: But as the
flesh is persed and burnt vp with the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taire
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:19417:17"/>
quhilk the Chirurgien dois apply,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 2.</note>
and is thereby made sensles and without

with sin, and ȝit hes na sense nor feeling
thairof: and therfore it is called, a caute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized,

proceidis from ane obdured, obstinate,

this obstinacie and blindnes, ay &amp; quhill
the Lord in his fearefull judgement, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to strike the saul and <hi>Conscience</hi> with
terrible terrours and torment: The form

               <p>THe Spirit of man, and every functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the spirit (either the imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the reasoun, the judgement, or the
memory) may be divers &amp; sindrie waies
damnified and troubled: Some tyme by
naturall sicknes and diseases, sometime
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:19417:18"/>
by naturall melancholie and euill dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of the body, sometime by contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
melancholie, quhilk man apprehen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deth
through sorrowe and care of warld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thingis, sometime by the exterior lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the partes of the head, quhilk are
called, the seats of these functions: And
sometime through sudden and extreame
feare, loue, joy, or vther sicklyke passions
of the minde. Al the quhilk thingis, are
obserued by the mediciners and chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giens,
&amp; in thair warkis ar aboundantlie
set furth. Yea sometime the Lord by his
immediate power, wil abstract the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the memorie, or vther offices of
the spirit, &amp; wil strike man with frensie,
with madnes, or forgetfulnes; &amp; restore
them againe at his pleasure. But the tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of mans <hi>Conscience,</hi> is farre different
from any of these troubles: quhilk is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
for the maist pairt, to arrise after
this maner. Quhen it pleisis the Lord at
any time, to shewe his angry face, and
to rebuke man for sin, incontinent man
is striken with sudden feare and tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:19417:18"/>
and begins to call to remembrance
quhat sins he hes committit, and quhair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he hes offendit his God: Ȝea, the Lord
will object his sinnes clearlie before his
eies, albeit they haue bene neuer sa lang
buried &amp; forgot with man: Quhilk quhen
he remembers, seeth the vglines thairof;
is accusit by his awin <hi>Conscience,</hi> &amp; feillis
the fearce wrath of God kindled against
him for his sinne; his spirit and <hi>Conscience</hi>
is marvellouslie troubled, and is sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
oppressed, with extreame paine and
torment: In sik sort, that the trouble of
the spirit wil oftimes redound to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
and trouble the whole estate of man;
as thogh he were takin with sum agonie,
or sharp fevar. It is true, that every man
whome the Lord so visits, will not bee
alike sore troubled and tormented; But
sum in a higher, sum in a lower degrie,
according to the modificatioun of the
Lord: But hee that hes the feeling of his
awin sinne, and of the wrath of God aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis
his sinne, in the highest degrie; that
man sall see nathing but the angrie face
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:19417:19"/>
of God, burning like a consuming fire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, and sal think na vther thing,
but that the Lord in his just judgement
hes castin him away, out from his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
&amp; kingdom: Quhilk of al torments,
that man can suffer in this life, is the gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test.
This kinde of trouble that proceids
from the <hi>Conscience,</hi> seemis sa strange &amp;
difficil to natural and warldly men, that
thay can hardly consaue it, but takes it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
vp wrang: and estiems those persons
that are so troubled, either to be furious,
lunatick, or fantastick: either els to haue
taken sum apprehension, melancholie,
or vaine conceit: Ȝea, not onely appeirs
it hard vnto them, but also to the very
Children of God, vnlesse they haue ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had some taisting of it them selues,
or else haue bene wel instructed therein,
by sik as hes had the liuely experience
thairof: As it is na wonder that flesh and
blude vnderstand it not: For it is a great
mysterie, and a woonderfull wark of the
maist high, quhilk by natural reason, can
not be comprehended. But as I haue said
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:19417:19"/>
before, the difference betuix the trouble
of the <hi>conscience,</hi> &amp; vther troubles, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
and great. For the diseases before
rehearsed are naturall; the disease of the
<hi>Conscience,</hi> supernaturall. The natural dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases
proceids from the euill constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and disposition of mans body, and his
warldly sorrow, and wanrest from the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude
&amp; care quhilk he hes of warldly
things: But the wanrest and anxietie of
the <hi>conscience,</hi> proceids from the sicht &amp;
consideration of mans sinne. Mairouer,
we see that the natural diseases of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
may be cured, by vsing of naturall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies:
sicknes may be healed, by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of salutaire medicaments: The
melancholious humors may be purged,
and the body brought to a gude tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature
and constitution: But all the Phisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,
and all the natural medecine vnder
heauen, can na mair remeid the woundit
<hi>conscience,</hi> nor corporall meat and drinke
can nourish the saul; or naked words can
satisfie the hunger &amp; thirst of the body.
Siklike, the displesure and sorrow quhilk
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:19417:20"/>
man contracts, either through the losse,
or through the care and desire of earthly
things; wil either, through tract of tyme
vanish away, quhair thingis lost cannot
be recouered; or be turned into joy and
contentment, quhen hee obtaineth the
things that he disired; whether sa it be ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
promotion, or victory over his ene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mies:
But all the riches, honour, and ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of the warld, wil never releeue the
paine of a tormented <hi>conscience;</hi> (vnles it
befor a very short space) while inwarde
comfort be given of the comforter, the
haly Ghost. I deny not but that the Lord
will sometime vse outward affliction, as
a means quhairby hee will cause man to
call his sinnes to remembrance, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently,
wil make his awin <hi>conscience</hi>
to condemne and torment him: But the
saule and <hi>conscience</hi> beeing once deeply
woundit; na worldlie consolation, nor
earthlie remedie can avail: while the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
of God worke first inwardly in the
heart. Farther, it is to be vnderstand, that
not onelie the wicked and reprobate are
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:19417:20"/>
accustomed to haue this trouble &amp; prick
of <hi>conscience:</hi> But also the very chosen
children of God, yea his dearest servants
hes euer bene, and ȝit are, maist subject
to the feiling of thair awin sin and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes:
Quhairby thay wil be sometimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to sik extremitie, that thair faith
wil be altogether smored for a season, &amp;
thay brocht to the very brinke, and bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
of desperation. Notwithstanding, al
their sufferings, in the end redounds to
their eternall joy and salvation: Quhair
by the contrair, the troubles of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
turnis at last to their vtter wrack and
confusion: For albeit the Lord, to trie &amp;
to humble his awin, &amp; to let them knaw
thair awin infirmities, wil sumty me hide
his face for a litle season, and couer them
as it wer, with a cloud: during the quhilk
space, they wil be in greit anguish &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>plexitie,
overshadowed with heavines &amp;
darknes, like the Moone ecclipsed, &amp; pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
of the licht of the Sunne: Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
in the middes of thair miseries, he
wil edge by the cloude, and shewe thame
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:19417:21"/>
blenks of mercy, of comfort, and of licht:
and at last will turne his louing counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
againe, and driue away al the dark<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes,
and heavines of thair sauls, and illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minat
them with eternal licht, and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.
To conclude, I wil say this meikle
farther, That there is nane whome the
Lord hes predestinat to salvation, quhilk
sal not, at sum time of thair life, be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
and tormented in some measure
(though not all equallie) in thair saull &amp;
<hi>conscience,</hi> throgh the sicht of thair awin
sinne: For this is certaine, that we cannot
enter into the kingdome of God, except
we first suffer, and abide tryall: It is not
possible, that wee can be exalted with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting
exaltation, except wee be first
casten downe and brocht lowe: It is not
possible, that we can be partakers of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
glory and gladnes in the heuen with
Christ, vnles wee be first participant of
paine with Christ, and feill with him, in
some mesure, the torments of hel in our
sauls and <hi>Consciences.</hi> Thairfore, let eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ane of vs make vs for it, and prepare
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:19417:21"/>
our selues for the day of trial and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:
Let vs turne in time to God, by
earnest repentance, and amendement of
life, before he strike vs in his judgement:
Let vs alwaies flee sinn, and follow rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes,
that in the day of trial the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
of our <hi>Conscience</hi> may be the lesse
feareful: And aboue all things, let vs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
Iesus Christ crucified for our
sinne, with a true and a liuely faith: For
if we once constantly beleeue that; wee
may be assured, that how low soeuer we
be brocht, howe extreame soeuer our
paine and torment be, ȝit the issue thair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
salbe happie, &amp; our deliverance joiful.</p>

is na quietnes nor contentment there:
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:19417:22"/>
For, howe can there be any rest, or dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation,
quhair man hes a feiling of Gods
wrath kindled aganis him, and is perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in his heart, that hee is out of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour

that estate, there is nathing for him but
wanrest, nathing but feare, sorrowe, lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing,
wearines, heavines, darknes, &amp;
paine, baith within, and without. In sik
sort, that if there were not intermissioun,
at some time, of the torment, the bodie
were not able to sustaine it: For the saul
and the bodie being joyned together by
a perfite vnion, The vexation of the saul
extendis to the body, quhilk hes a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
and a suffering together with the
saull. Quhairvpon it followis, that hee
quha is troubled in spirit and <hi>Conscience,</hi>
wil be bereft of all naturall rest, though
vtherwaies he be hail baith in body and
spirit, and that nature vse al the right of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices;
ȝit the <hi>Conscience</hi> being wounded,
the trouble thairof, sall bereif man the
nichts sleep: his slumbrings wil be short,
and encombred with vglie dreames: his

nor forget. Siklike, the meat and
drink will be lothsome vnto him: neither
wil he delight meikil in any warldly ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure:
But all earthly recreation wil bee
mair fashious, nor delectable vnto him:
Ȝea it wil appeare to himselfe, that al the
creatures of God are animate, as it were,
and conspired against him. Nevertheles,
the inclination and behavior of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
man, beeing visited by the hande of
God, wil be far different from the beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
of the godly: For the wicked man
wil be mair sorrowful for his awin wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
and paine, nor for his sinne, quhairby
hee hes offendit the majestie of God. He
wil also blame the instrumentall causes
of his trouble, mair nor himselfe: and wil
seeke vnlawful meanes to bee releifed of
his paine; sometime labouring to delait
it out of his mind, by giuing himselfe to
warldly pleasures, and vsing of wanton
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:19417:23"/>
and riotous companie: sometyme by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging
himselfe on them whome he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiems
to be the instrumental causes of
his trouble: and sometime by consulting
with sorcerers, and seeking responces of
vncleane sprits. To be short, he hes euer
a looking back to the warld; and if he get
any releif of his paine, incontinent he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnis
to his former impietie, like a sowe
to the puddle, and heaps sinne vpon sin,
quhairby his <hi>conscience</hi> is mair and mair
wounded, and his paine thereafter incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed:
Quhil at the last, hee fallis in vtter
despair; and ather puts violent hands in
himselfe, as Iudas did; or els is perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tormented with the worme of his <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi>
as Cain was, during his whole
life tyme. By the contrair, the Childe of
God, quhen he feels the correctioun of
his Maker, and is accused by his awin
<hi>conscience,</hi> he is immediatly taken with a
godly sorrow for his sinne, and hes a see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
to God for mercie and releif. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
hee wil finde in himselfe a
great inconstancie, &amp; waiknes: For some
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:19417:23"/>
tyme he wil be ouerset with sadnes, and
in ane instant wil be changed, quhairof
he cannot render a reason, but as the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
mouis him: Sometyme, he wil be fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
in praier, sometime cold and remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
Sometime, he wil pray formally and
weil, sometime informally, being inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
with teares,<note place="margin">Psalme 77. 4.</note> or with wauering
thochts: ȝea, sometime he wil be sa con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused,
that hee cannot pray, but wil vtter
his passions with grones, with sichis, &amp;
with sobbes. Attoure, hee wil haue ane
earnest desire to heare the word of God
preached, or red; and wil think it marve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
comfortable and sweit: and when he
heares any part thereof that touchis him
selfe, whether sa it be the description of
his miserie, or the gracious promises, &amp;
mercies of the Lord rehearsed; he wil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice
exceidingly, and partly for joy of
the gudnes of God, and partly for griefe
of his awin fal, and vnthankfulnes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his Creator; he wil oftymes burst
out with teares in aboundance. Besides
this, the wounded <hi>conscience</hi> may not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:19417:24"/>
to heare any cursed or prophane
speaking: or to heare the name of God
in any waies blaspheamed, meikil les wil
he do it himselfe, For hee is taken with a
great fear to offend the majestie of God,
hauing alredy felt the stroke of his hand.
Siklike, the leist offence quhilk hee can
commit, wil appear to him to be of gret
grauitie &amp; waight: For like as the wound
of the body wil be sa sair, that the patient
can scarselie suffer any thing to touch it:
Even so, the woundit <hi>conscience</hi> is sa waik
that the lest vnseemly word, wrang luke,
or wauering thocht quhilk man can vse,
wil hurt and trouble it, and make it to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mord.
Finally, when the oppressed <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi>
gets any blenk of comfort, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease
of his paine; he wil spring for joye,
and think that he sal neuer again be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
with sik perturbation: Bot sa sone as
the Lord turnis away his face, newe tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and doubtings wil arrise againe, as
though he had never receiued comfort.
And that quhilk is admirable, &amp; a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
wark of Gods spirit; at sometyme
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:19417:24"/>
the remembrance of a sinne, or of a deed
done, wil sa trouble man, that he cannot
be comforted: And at ane vther time the
commemoration and sicht of that same
sin, wil na mair moue him, nor gif it had
neuer bene committed. This appearant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

Then I wald exhort thee, in the name of
our Lord Iesus Christ, to enter into this
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:19417:25"/>
meditation and thinking with thy selfe.
I perceiue the Lord is mindful of me, &amp;
hes visited me: For I feel my self inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
touched: The Lord knocks at the dore
of my <hi>Conscience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> but quhat his will is, or
quhat wark he is to wark in me, I knawe
not: howsoever it be, this is doubtles the
day of temptation, and the time of my
trial: so that my estate is dangerous: For
I knaw, that the sprit and image of Satan
wil striue in me; aganis the sprit &amp; image
of God: and if I harken not to the Lords
cal, but ȝeild vnto the sprit of Satan, I am
but lost. Thairfore, I beseik the Lord to
be on my side, and to assist me with his
haly spreit in this perrellous battel, that I
may stand fast, and submit my self whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
to his haly wil. This done, prepare
thy selfe for the tryal, by fasting and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stenance,
from the sensual lustes of the
flesh: For thairby thou sal be meikle ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of thy paine, and sal baith be better
disposed to serue thy God, and be made a
mair meet subject to the spreit of God
to wark in. Being humbled &amp; prepared,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:19417:25"/>
first of all clenge thy heart &amp; <hi>Conscience:</hi>
For, gif thou present thy selfe before the
Lord with a polluted heart, and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Conscience;</hi> Al that you can do or say,
wil be but abhomination vnto him; and
he will nather regard thy praiers, nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
any seruice at thy hands;<note place="margin">Deut. 4. 24 Heb. 12. 29</note> But wil ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be a consuming fire redie to destroy
thee. Thairfore, let the maner of thy clen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ging
be this: Enter in sharp trial and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination
of thy life and conversation,
from thy youth vp: Cal to remembrance
quhat kinde of vice or vices hes greatest
dominion in thee; and quhat offences
thou hes committed from time to time,
either against God or thy Neighbour:
This do, not only at a time, but at divers
and sundrie times: For thou wilt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
at ane time, that quhilk thou can not
do at ane vther: Quhilk if thou examine
narrowlie, not flattering thy self, I doubt
not, but thou sal find thy sinnes vglie y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
and of ane hudge number: Ȝea, it
may be, that the memory and considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them humble thee very farre, and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:19417:26"/>
make thee baith to abhorre them, &amp; thy
selfe, that suld haue committed sik abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations.
Having nowe ryppit vp thy
sinne, quhilk is the fountain of al thy mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery;
thou hes nixt to turne thee with thy
hail heart to the Lord, seeking help and
releif at his hands, quha is onely able to
deliuer thee. But howe sal I turne (may
thou say) to the Lord? for I knaw not the
way. Surely, the lord hes taught the way,
how a sinner sall turne vnto him:<note place="margin">Mat. 4. 17.</note> To wit,
even by earnest &amp; vnfained repentance;<note place="margin">Acts. 2. 38.</note>
and by a true and liuely faith in the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of God,<note place="margin">Iere. 41. &amp; 6. 16.</note> through the death of Iesus
Christ. As to the forme of thy repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
let it be this: Cast downe thy selfe
on thy face and knees before thy God, &amp;
with a broken heart; First, confesse thy
sinnes freely vnto him, without hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
howe secreit or abhominable soeuer
they be: For if thou dissemble, or meane
to hide any thing fra him, that knawis
the leist hirne of thy heart;<note place="margin">Iere. 11. 20</note> thy labour is
al in vaine; and thou but provokes his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
mair and mair against thee.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:19417:26"/>
Secondly, thou mon be sorrowfull in thy
heart for thy sinne: For except thou be
displeased with thy self, that thou hes of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
thy gude God; think not that thy
offences sal be forgiuen: neither sal it suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fise
to say, that it repenteth thee of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil
quhilk thou hes done; vnles thou rew
in very deid: For the Lord that is the sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
of the hart,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 16. 7.</note> knawis quhat thou dois
think, albeit thy sayings be never sa gud.
Thairfore, beware that thou vse na dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation
with him, leist for thine hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie
he confound thee. Thirdly, amend
thy life in times cumming, by abstaining
not onely from the sinnes, quhairvnto
thou hes bene maist addicted: But also,
from al vther kind of sinne: and, be doing
that quhilk is gude and acceptable in the
sicht of the Lord: For, this is the fruit of
repentance. So, that he quhilk sayis hee
repents, and amends not his life in some
measure, but continues in his former
wickednes; hee is a lyar, and the spreit of
God is not in him. But foralsmeikle as al
sinne, is either committed aganis God
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:19417:27"/>
onlie, and the first table of his Lawe: ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
else aganis man, and the second ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
Thou aucht diligently to mark baith
the ane and the vther, that is maist ryfe in
thee, &amp; that sorest pricks thy <hi>Conscience.</hi>
Al sinne is aganis God, but al sinn is not
aganis man: Thou may also offend God
by thine euil thocht, because hee knawis
thy thocht: But be thy thocht man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be offended, becaus he knawis it not.
If then thy sin be aganis God only, thou
hes God only to satisfie, by acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thy sinne, by sorrowing for thy sinn,
by imploring mercie for thy sinne, and
by refraining thy selfe thereafter from
that sinn. But if thou haue sinned aganis
man, by offending him in word or deed;
either in body, goods, or name: In that
cace, thou mon baith craue pardone at
the hands of God, and trauel by al means
possible to be reconciled with man: Ȝea,
except thou first endevoure thy selfe, sa
far as in thee lyis, to satisfie man whome
thou hes sa offended; assure thy self, that
God wil not be satisfied in the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hes thou
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:19417:27"/>
made a godly vowe to the Lord, quhilk
thou hes not performed? Performe thy
godly vowe (if it be possible) vnto him:
Hes thou made a lawful promise vnto
man, quhilk thou hes not keeped? Fulfil
thy promise if it be possible, albeit it be
to thy losse. Be not ashamed to addresse
thy selfe to him, quhome thou hes offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
althogh he be thy inferiour, &amp; craue
pardone of him for thine offence: And
looke quhat satisfactioun hee can justly
craue of thee, either in wordes, in gudes,
or vther kind of deid; See thou be willing
to make it, according to thy power: That
thou may obtaine peace of <hi>Conscience;</hi> &amp;
that the cries of the oppressed saul quhilk
sustaines bitternes &amp; wrong, ascend not
to the Lord, and procure his vengeance
against thee. Farther, quhasoeuer hes of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
thee, thou mon forgiue thame
thair offences freely: That the Lord may
also forgiue thee thine offences: But gif
thou forgiue not men thair trespasses,<note place="margin">Mat. 6. 15</note>
Iesus Christ certifies thee, that thy hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
Father wil na mair forgiue thee
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:19417:28"/>
thy trespasses. Finally, thou mon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
thy corrupted affections, &amp; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing that withhalds thee from God,
howe deare and precious soeuer it be in
thine eies: Root out thy vices, ane by ane
out of thy heart, quhilk hes had sa lang
dominion ouer thee: And in every thing
do that quhilk thou knawis to be the wil
of God: Setting aside thine awin wil, and
remouing al warldly respects, and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments
quhatsoeuer; howe vnapeirand,
or far repugnant soeuer it be, to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
inclination of thy heart: That the
Lord may be weil pleased with thee, and
that thou may haue the testimonie of a
gude <hi>Conscience.</hi> O! But these are harde
sayings to flesh and blude, and here sal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise
a strong battell within thee, quhen
thou art this waies tried with the renun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation
of thy awin wil, and affectiouns;
and vrged to doe that quhilk is contrary
to thy manly hart: For oftymes wil thou
think with thy selfe: Sall I forgiue him,
that hes done me sik wrang, and craueth
na pardon of me? Sal I suffer this of him?
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:19417:28"/>
Sal I not be revenged of this injurie, and
on him with whome I am sa far behind?
Siklike, quhen it commeth to the renun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of the affections of thy hart, quhilk
thou hes followed &amp; served sa lang; and
of that domestick Idole, quhilk thou and
every man hes erected in the heart: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sa it be, the lusts and plesures of the
flesh, warldly honours and vaine glorie,
couetousnes of warldly gudes, the desire
of revenge, or vther quhatsumeuer vice,
quhairunto thou art cheifly bound in ser<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uitude:
That conflict (I say) wilbe felon,
and that departing difficil: For the spreit
of the deuil, and the naturall corruption
of thine awin heart, wil striue michtelie
aganis the spreit of God, and the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
part of thy saul, if any be: Swa that
thou sal make many shifts and excuses to
satisfie thy a win wil and appetite, to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill
the desire of thy heart, and to retaine
that Idole, quhilk like a bond-slaue, thou
serues and adores. Yea, the young riche
man,<note place="margin">Mat. 19. 21.</note> quhome Christ bad sell al that hee
had, giue it to the poore, and folow him;
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:19417:29"/>
made neuer greater mourning, nor the
natural man wil make to quyte his Idol,
the strongest affection of his hart, quhair<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vnto
he is thrall: For the deuil was neuer
lother to come out of the person whom
he possesseth, nor naturall vices wilbe to
come out of mans hart, where thay haue
once taken deepe root. Bot thou, O man
that art inwardly touched! may knawe
quhairon it stands: either mon thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue
man,<note place="margin">Deu. 32. 35</note> and remit the revenge to God
(to whome vengeance apertaineth) and
to his lieutenants whom he hes appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to execute justice vpon earth: or else
looke not to be forgiuen of thy heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Father,<note place="margin">Mat. 6. 15</note> nor to be releeved of thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
trouble.<note place="margin">Luke 9. 23.</note> In like manner, either mon
thou renounce al thy wicked affections
quhatsumeuer, and reforme thame, in
some measure: or else renounce thy part
of the kingdome of heauen. This meikle
concerning the turning to God, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
and amendement of life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nixt
followis, the turning to God by faith.</p>
               <p>Hes thou tried thy warks, and turned to
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:19417:29"/>
God by earnest repentance, and with a
resolute mind to amend thy life in times
comming? Now try likewaies thy faith,
&amp; take diligent heed, whether it be waik,
wauering, and ful of doubting or not: &amp;
whether it agrees with the true, haly, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholik,
and apostolike faith, or not: and
where thou findes it deficient in any of
these points, turn with speid to the Lord,
and embrace him with a true and a liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
faith: For without faith, al thy repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and all thy gude warks cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
a whit; but ar like a filthie menstrous
clout in the sicht of the Lord. There is
many men that wil take heede to thair
warks, and wil flie from vice and vnrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes;
quhilk takes na tent to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of thair faith, and to thair zeale, and
fervencie in the true seruice &amp; worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of God; quhilk is a matter of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
consequence. But it is not thy warks
can make thee free from sinne,<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 27 28.</note> nor from
hel:<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 1.</note> It is by faith thou mon be justified;
and through thy beliefe thou mon be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.<note place="margin">1. Pet. 1. 9.</note>
Yea,<note place="margin">Iohn. 6. 47.</note> but quhat sal I beleeue (would
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:19417:30"/>
thou say) that I may be saued? Euen this
thou hes to beleeue. First, that the God
of heauen, quhilk wes worshipped in Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell,
is the onely true God, the Almich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and eternall father, quha hes created
all the warld, and by his deuine power,
gouerns the same, and all things therein
contained. Secondly, thou mon beleeue
that this same God, according to his pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mise
made to our Fathers, hes sent his
onely Sonne Iesus Christ, downe from
heauen into this warld, to take away the
sinnes of mankind, quhairin all wer shot
vp through the disobedience of our first
progenitor Adam: Quhilk, as a gracious
Sauiour became a naturall man, and by
his death and obedience, hes made the
reconciliation betwixt God and vs, and
hes redeemed vs from the hel quhairvn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
al were condemned. Beleeue that in
him the Lord is weill pleased, and with
thee for his sake: That he hes made a full
and sufficient recompense for al thy sins
bypast &amp; to come: that he is risen againe
from death, and by his resurrection hes
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:19417:30"/>
ouercome the same, and the sting thairof,
quhilk is sinne, the deuil, and hel the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compense
of sinne. Beleeue that hee is
ascended againe to the heuen, and there
sits at the richt hand of his Father, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
intercession to him for thee, and all
that beleeues in his death; and that he sal
yet come againe from heauen to judge
the warld, &amp; sal raise thee to everlasting
life. Thirdly, thou mon beleeue, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the ascension of our Saviour Iesus
Christ; the Comforter, the haly Ghost
and spreit of God, wes sent downe from
the Father and the Sone into this warld;
To rule, to preserue, to instruct, to stren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
to comfort, to renewe and sanctifie
by his michtie power, al the chosen chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of God (quhilk is his halie and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersal
Kirk) ay and quhill Iesus Christ
come againe to finish al things. If thou
apprehend these three persons and ane
God with a true faith; &amp; beleeue al thair
warks, thair precepts, &amp; promises quhilk
are set downe in the Scriptures; as also
the doctrine of thair Prophets, Apostles,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:19417:31"/>
Pastors, and ministers: Thou may certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
thy selfe, that though thy sinnes were
neuer sa hainous and detestable, thay sall
be freelie remitted, and neuer laid to thy
charge; That thou art ane whome the
Lord hes predestinate to eternal saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
&amp; that al thy present pain sal be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
in everlasting pleasure. But thou
may justly object vnto me, that thou can
nather vse sik a forme of repentance: nor
ȝit can find sik strenth of faith in thy self,
as is heere required. Indeede it is true,
that nather faith, nor repentance are at
thy taking: nor ȝit can be giuen thee by
any creature: but mon proceed from the
michtie working of Gods spirit in thy
heart. Thairfore, thou mon prostrate thy
selfe before the Lord, and by earnest and
diligent praier, craue them incessantlie
at his hands, quha hes onely power to
giue them. Shewe him in thy praier that
thou art miserable; that without his help
thou art but lost, that thou can do na gud
thing, except hee giue thee grace, that
thou art there reddy to obey his wil, and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:19417:31"/>
inquire of him, quhat he wald haue thee
to doe; burding him with his mercifull
promises; remember him of his wonted
mercies, and warks of old; but cheiflie of
the sufferings and satisfaction of his Son
Iesus christ, to quhais richteousnes thou
mon cleaue; and in his name, and for his
sake, mon craue mercie, grace, pacience,
strength, increase of faith, and releefe of
thy paine, according to his gude plesure,
at the bountiful hands of God. Oh, but
here is all the difficultie, wilt thou say, I
am sa troubled and dejected, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
pray. Surelie, I graunt that the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
spirit, wil be sometimes brocht
to sik extremitie, that it can neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
repent, pray, nor meditate: But like
a brute beast, wil remain for a season, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togither
stupifact and confused. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when thou art in that perplexitie, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
pacientlie the Lords wil &amp; leasure;
for thair is na remeid but pacience, quhil
the Lord driue away the darknes of thy
minde; seeing that obscuritie wil not tary
lang: and at leist, sa far as is possible, haue
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:19417:32"/>
the eie of thy heart direct towardes the
Lord, and thy thocht caried vp to the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen;
haue a desire to pray, and vtter thy
intention with sighs: For the Lord that is
a spirit knawis what thy spirit wald, albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it
there be nathing vttered in wordes.<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 27.</note>
And when thou gets a blenk of licht, and
release of thy paine, haue refuge hastelie
to the Mediator Iesus Christ, quha hes
bidden sik as are wearie and laden come
to him and he will ease them: Powre out
thy complaints &amp; supplications before
him, and beseech him to make mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to his Father for thee whome he hes
redeemed with his blood, to appease his
Fathers wrath, and to present thee fault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
vnto him. Father, least thou be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
farre casten downe with the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
and sicht of thy sinne; haue not
thine eies alwaies fixed vpon the vglines
of thy sinne: but rather vpon the infinite
mercies of God, quhilk exceids thy sinne
in greatnes. Remember likewaies, his
merciful promises, and mercy shewed to
his servants, that hes bene in the like e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estate,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:19417:32"/>
that thou art now in: And if thou
can remember that the Lord hes shewed
mercie at any time on thee before, by
deliuering thee out of danger or troble:
Then thou may be suirly perswaded that
he wil shew mercie on thee again: for the
mercie of God is without repentance.<note place="margin">Ro. 11. 29.</note>
Heirfore, if thou continue after this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
in fasting, in praier, in purging &amp; cir<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cumcising

thy minde: as by witch-craft, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of thy warldly and fleshly pleasures,
or by revenging on thine enemies: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siddering,
that this sal at length augment
thy paine, albeit it seeme pleasant for a
season, and sall prolong thy trouble: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
thou seekes not to God, that is see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
thee; but turnes thy back vpon him,
&amp; seeks help where it is not to be found.
Beware thou continue not in thy woon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vice and wickednes, heaping sinn vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
sinn, without regard what thou dois,
or taking vp of thy self from thy vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
course: For then in contemptible man<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner
thou despisest the Lords correction,
&amp; will not be reformed by his discipline,
but takes a plaine banner aganis him, &amp;
kindles his fearce wrath more and more
agains thee, in sik sort, that thou sall at
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:19417:34"/>
the last bring thy selfe to vtter desperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Beware thou reuile not thy estate,
and forme of thy trouble rashly to every
man: neither craue thou the advise, and
counsell of naturall &amp; worldly men; mei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle
lesse, follow thou their opinion in the
matter of the trouble and disease of thy
<hi>Conscience:</hi> For then thou dois no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies,
nor if thou would craue the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultation
of a jurisconsult, in the matter
of thy health: or advise thy proces with
a medicinar. There is neither helpe, nor
true comfort to be found that way, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
the natural and vnregenerate man;
yea the vnregenerate part of the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
man (for there is no perfyte regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
in this life) is altogither blinde in
spirituall things, &amp; wil ever giue a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
direct contrary to the will and spirit
of God. Mairover, bridle and refrain thy
tongue, that vnruly member, as with a
bit, from lying, slaundering, backbyting,
mocking, railling, vpbraiding, and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
speaking: For thereby thy <hi>Conscience</hi>
may be grievously wounded. And for as
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:19417:35"/>
much as the world is ful of temptations,
and stumbling blocks, whereon man is
daily in danger to fall: Therefore I would
wish thee, so long as thy <hi>Conscience</hi> is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eased,
not to entangle nor meddle thy
selfe much with worldly busines: but to
abstract thy mind from the solicitude of
temporall affaires; and to withdrawe thy
selfe from the societie of the prophane
multitude: to the effect, that being free
from al outward perturbation, thou may
be the better disposed to serue thy God,
to giue thy selfe to contemplation, and
to be exercised in all spirituall and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exercitions. Let then thy daily exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise,
during the disease of thy <hi>Conscience,</hi>
be this: If thou can read, giue thy selfe to
the lecture of comfortable books com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
by learned and godly men; and to
the reading of the holy Scriptures: But
in speciall revolue diligently the bookes
of Genesis &amp; Exodus, the history of Iob,
the Psalmes of David, the Evangel of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ according to Matthewe and
Iohn, the Acts of the Apostles, and their
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:19417:35"/>
Epistles. Where thou shall finde singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
comfort in the wonderfull works, and
divine providence of the Lord in delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and preserving of his people; in his
healthsome instructions &amp; gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mises
made vnto them; and in his excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
great mercie, and loving kindnes to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wards
his servaunts, quhilk haue bene in
the like estate, that thou art now in. The
company quhilk thou frequents, let it be

and consolation. And if thou woulde
communicate thy secreit vexation to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
man; or wold be resolved of any thing
whereof thou art in doubt. Addresse thee
to some notable servant of God, appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in life and knawledge, to whome the
Lord hath committed the dispensation
of his word: To him disclose thy minde,
&amp; seek resolution of him, in those things
quhilk concerns thy <hi>Conscience,</hi> and weill

And giue diligent eare to the preaching

while thy heart and <hi>Conscience,</hi> be purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

meditations of the wonderful works, the

his Kirk, and the members thereof, from
the beginning of the worlde. Rehearse &amp;

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:19417:36"/>
his pacience, tender loue,

Be euer cleansing thy heart, and ryp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
out the latent vice, &amp; heritable cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
that lurks within thee: that thou
may be a meet receptacle, and temple of
the holy Ghost: For where the heart is
polluted, and the <hi>Conscience</hi> defiled, the
spirit of God can make no residence nor
dwelling. Reconcile thy selfe, so far as is
possible, with al men: Expell all malice,
hatred, and envie. Be not a revenger of
thine owne cause: For thereby thou sall
renew and ranckle the wound of thy <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science:</hi>
but remit the vengeance thereof
to God, &amp; craue justice of the Magistrat.
Try and examine thy self, how thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
in knawledge, faith, and amendment
of life, by the reading &amp; hearing of Gods
word. Reduce in memory what dangers
of body, of soule, or oflosing thy goods,
thou hes ben in, during the course of thy
life, and how the Lord hes delivered and
preserued thee. Siklike, cal to mind what
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:19417:37"/>
good gifts of the body, of the spirit, or of
other temporall things, thy God hes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
on thee: Be thankful to him ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and therevpon thou may take assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
that considering the constancie of
the Lord, he wil neuer leaue thee altogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
destitute of help; but wil euer haue
mercie and compassion on thee, as hee
hes had in times preceiding. Be alwaies
occupied in well doing and exercise the
workes of righteousnes: visite the sicke,
comfort the sorrowfull, support the poor
and needie, defend the poore oppressed,
treate peace and concord among neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
and brethren: Instruct the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
in the knowledg of Iesus Christ. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
let al thy actions, thy wordes, and
cogitations tend to the glory of God, to
charitie and meeknes. And every night,
when thou goest to bed, or being in thy
bed, take count of thy selfe how thou hast
bestowed that day: If thou hes bene wel
exercised, praise God for it, and trauel to
continue: If thou hes bene euil occupied,
sleepe not while thou repent, and craue
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:19417:37"/>
God mercie for thy offences: Take pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose

thy selfe to amend, take newe reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
to reforme thy waies, and aspyre
daily by the grace of God, to a greater
perfection. But aboue all things, be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
in fasting and praier: Pray continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally;
for thereby al good thinges are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained:
Pray in the Morning, in the Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
at mid-day, &amp; at al times when the
spirit movis thee: yea, chiefly in the night
when others are at rest, arise (if the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie
may serue) or secretly in thy bed
enter in familiar and earnest conference
with thy God. And when thou findes a
coldnes &amp; sluggishnes in thy self to pray,
and to worship God: The commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and remembrance of the woonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
works and mercies of God, of thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
out of thy former troubles, and
of his manifolde benefites bestowed on
thee (which thou for that same purpose,
should collect and keepe for a memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
in write.) The memory, I say, of these
things, shal kindle and inflame thy spirit
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:19417:38"/>
to be fervent in praier, &amp; zealous in the
service of thy Creator. And albeit this
forme of liuing may perchance appeare
austere, painful, &amp; tedious to thee in the
beginning: (though nothing suld seeme
painfull or fasheous to thee, considering
thy dangerous estate, &amp; the importance
of the matter it self, quhilk concerns thy
salvation &amp; damnation) Nevertheles, by
frequent custome, thou shalt find it most
easie, comfortable, and sweet: For, like as
thou hes now a sicht &amp; sore feling of thy

for thy sin: So sall thou doubtles in short

Whereby thou sall obtain peace of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,</hi>
with such contentment, &amp; gladnes

to him, to obteine al good thinges at his

me poor wretch, in thy mercie, here
on the face of this low earth, prostrat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thine holy &amp; high throane. Alace! I
confes Lord, that I am not worthie to lift
vp my face to heaven, nor to receiue any
comfort or good thing of thy hands: For
I haue sinned, alace! I haue sinned aganis
thee, I haue broken thy statutes, I haue
abused thy clemencie &amp; benefits, I haue
committit abhomination, &amp; followitthe
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:19417:39"/>
affections and lusts of mine owne heart.
Wherefore, thou hast nowe, Lord, affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
me, and that most justly: Thou hast
made mine owne <hi>Conscience</hi> to accuse, &amp;
torment me: my soul is vehemently vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and heauie vnto death, my heart is
faint through anguish, and my flesh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes
and pines for feare of the stroke of
thy hand. Thou art angrie, O Lord? thou
art angrie: but who is able to abide thy
fearce wrath? Thou knowest that man is
but a vaine thing,<note place="margin">Psal. 39. 5</note> his life is like a vapour,
or a shadow which vanisheth away in an
instant, and the imaginations of his hart
are euil and wicked.<note place="margin">Genes. 8. 21</note> I am but dust, &amp; like
the flowre of the field which withers and
decaies suddenly; I cannot abide the heat
of thine anger. It is true, Lord, that I am
inexcusable, and sinful out of measure;
but mercie belongs vnto thee; let thy
mercie therefore abound, and appear in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
in forgiving me many sins, I turne
me vnto thee, O Lord, turne thee againe
vnto me; I seeke thy face, hide not thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
face from me; but let the bright
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:19417:39"/>
blenks of thy loving countenance shine
on me: For thou knowest, it repenteth me
of the evil which I haue done, and that I
trust in thee: But, Lord supply my defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
repentance, and helpe my vnbeleefe:
For my repentance is imperfect, and my
faith is weake. None can come to thee,
vnlesse thou draw them;<note place="margin">Iohn. 6. 44.</note> nor can beleeue
while they be conuerted by thy spirite:
Draw me therefore vnto thee, and I shal
come; convert me, and I shal be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
O Lord, Thou knowest the dolour &amp;
sorrowe of my heart for my sinne, thou
seest my miserie and trouble: Day and
night I mourne and I lament, my face is
al bedewed with teares, and my soul we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth
of my life: I am a monster to them
that beholds me, and mine acquaintance
wonders at my miserie. There is no help
in man, neither doth any worldly conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
availe me. No Man, nor Angell
is able to releeue mee, but thou onely:
without thy help, Lord, I am but lost for

morning and forgot in the evening: Thy
mercie exceeds my sinnes, and all things
in greatnes; and there is no end with thy
compassion. Let not then, O Lord, thy
mercie be shut vp in displeasure; be not
angrie with me for ever, neither correct
me any more in thy wrath: For I am no
more in thy hands, nor the potshard is in
the handes of the potter: But remember
thy wonted mercies, and workes of olde
shewed to thy servants <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> &amp;
<hi>Iacob,</hi> to <hi>Moses, David;</hi> and to thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

remember the anguish of his heart, when
he praied vnto thee, that night he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traied;
&amp; his cries on the crosse, when he
cried vnto thee, My God, my God! why
hes thou forsaken me? Was it not for my
sin, O Lord, that he suffered these things?
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:19417:40"/>
Loose not then thy poor servant whome
thou hes so dearlie bought with the blud

Haue not respect to my deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings,

Son, my saviour, cast my sins behind thy

and haue pittie on my distres &amp; miserie.
Behold, Lord, I am here, what is thy will

from the bondage of Satan, of sin,
and of mine owne concupiscence. I thirst
for thy mercie and grace, O Lord, as the

Redresse my faultes therefore, let them
be freely forgiuen, as though they had

giuen me a feeling of my sinne, and of
thine indignation against sinne: So giue
me a sure perswasion of the remission of

and mistrust depart from me:
Settle and pacifie my perturbed spirite,
binde vp my wounded <hi>Conscience,</hi> heale
my contrite &amp; broken heart, restore my
courage and my strength, restore me to
that joye quhilk I was woont to finde in

thy scourge from me: for I haue
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:19417:41"/>
felt enough thy hand: mitigate my pain,
&amp; let me see the issue of my troubles, that
I may be able to beare them: yet, not as I
will Lord, but as thou wilt: If thy glory
may be advanced through my sufferings;
or thy power made perfect through my
infirmitie and weaknesse; let mee suffer
whatsoeuer pleaseth thee: Try me, as the
gold &amp; as the silver, quhilk is purified in

For thou knowest I am weak, and am but
flesh. Giue me therfore patience, strenth,

Let thy constant and good spirit rest in

well content with thy good pleasure,
whatsoeuer crosse or afflictioun it shall

what is good for me, thou hes al pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in heuen, and in earth, thou hes a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
care and loue towards thy chosen
Children, thou art constant, and true in

waite on thee (my God) I will suffer thy

them. I render my selfe vnto thee; I giue
me over, soul &amp; body, in thy hands; I sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit

Graunt me therefore, O Lord, onlie thy

the same to my bretheren, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
through my example may flie sin,
&amp; they quhilk are likewise dejected, may
learne to seek help, and comfort in their
trouble, where it is to be found; even at
thy hands, O Lord, to thy perpetual glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
to the comfort of thy Kirk, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe
of the kingdome of Satan.</p>

               <head type="sub">What comfort they may haue, that are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
in Spirit and Conscience.</head>
               <p>FOr so much as it is impossible to man,
or Angell, by any reason, perswasion,
or consolation; to comfort that persone
from whome the Lord hes hid his favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
face: while it please his majestie to
turne againe his loving countenance, &amp;
to worke a sure perswasion of his favour
inwardly in the hart, by the operation of
his holy spirit. Nevertheles, the ordinary
means and citation of the gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:19417:44"/>
of the Lord, whereby man may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
comfort in troble, ought not to be
contemned: Bot by the contrary, we suld
haue refuge in al our afflictions therevn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
being left to vs by God to that effect:
For comfort must proceed from faith, &amp;
faith must come through the hearing of
the word, and promises of God sounded,
quhilk the holy Ghost thereafter makes
to work in the heart. Therefore, the sweet
comfort that thou may receiue (O man!
that art afflicted in spirit and <hi>Conscience</hi>)
is greter nor I am able to expresse; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
a part is this. First for confirmation of
thy faith, thou may knowe by extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
experience, that there is a divine
power, even a God that rules the hearts
of al men; and that the same God among
all his creatures, is mindefull of thee. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
It is a manifest token, that thou
art beloued of God, when he chastises, &amp;
rebukes thee: For, whome the Lord loues
(saith the Apostle) he chastises, &amp; scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
every Son that he receiues:<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 5.</note> VVhen
he corrects thee,<note place="margin">Prou. 3. 11.</note> he offers himselfe vnto
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:19417:45"/>
thee,<note place="margin">Reu. 3. 19.</note> as vnto his Son; and doth it for thy
profit, that thou may bee partaker of his
holines. Thirdly, It is not possible, that
thou can be exalted to Christs kingdom,
except thou be first assaulted with temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,<note place="margin">Act. 14. 22</note>
except thou be casten down, and
haue a liuely feling of thine own sin and
wretchednes: Thou can not be victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
vnles thou fight; &amp; thou cannot ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
a crowne of victory, vnles thou be
victorious.<note place="margin">2. Tim. 2. 12</note> But if thou suffer with Christ,<note place="margin">Rev. 3. 21.</note>
thou sal also raigne with him: and if thou
resist &amp; overcome temptation, as he did,
thou sal be sure also to sit with him in his
throane, as hee sits with his Father in his
throne. Fourthly, albeit thou be in great
perplexitie, thou suld not thinke that the
Lord hes forsaken thee, or is wrath with
thee: For the Lord is not at all times an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie
with his children, when he appeares
to them to be angrie, &amp; when they haue
a feling of the lack of his favour: Neither
doth hee alwaies chastise them for their
sins: but is accustomed at some time, to
hide his face from them for a litle season;
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:19417:45"/>
to let them knowe their owne weaknes,
and wretchednes, to worke patience in
them, to acquaint them with his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
and to let them know how misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
their estate is, when his favourable
face is hid from them. Fiftly,<note place="margin">Iohn. 3. 3.</note> There is a
time, at the quhilk the Lord makes inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
to al his chosen children, of their
election and salvation, by sending them
his holy spirit,<note place="margin">Tit. 3. 5.</note> by whome they are bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and regenerat to amendment of life:
And commonly before this calling and
receiving of the holy Ghost, there goes a
great trouble of the minde, a dejection,
and a terrible feare; that it wald seeme to
man, that God had forsaken him, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten
him away; where by the contrary, he
is drawing him to him, and knocking to
haue entrie in his hart by his holy spirit.
What sal I recount the gracious &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
promises of the Lord, to his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
members, that are touched with a
feeling of their owne sin, and miserie? He
saith, by the mouth of the Prophet;<note place="margin">Psa. 103. 13</note> That
as a Father hes compassion on his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:19417:46"/>
so hes he compassion on them that
fear him:<note place="margin">Esai. 49. 15</note> And though a woman suld for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
the son of her wombe, yet will he not
forget his elect. For a litle while (saith the
Lord to his people) haue I forsaken thee,<note place="margin">Esa. 54. 7</note>
but with great compassion will I gather
thee: For a moment, in mine anger, I hid
my face from thee for a little season, but
with everlasting mercie haue I had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
on thee.<note place="margin">Psal. 34. 18</note> The Lord (saith <hi>David</hi>)
is neere vnto them that are of a contrite
heart, and will saue such as be afflicted in
spirit.<note place="margin">Psal. 51. 17.</note> And againe, The sacrifices of God,
are a contrite spirit: a contrite, and a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
heart, O God, thou wilt not reject &amp;
despise. Mairover, saith not our savior Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, that hee came not to saue the
righteous, but to bring sinners to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance?
The Son of Man (saith he) came to
saue that quhilk was lost:<note place="margin">Mat. 18. 11.</note> hes hee not also
commandit such as ar weary &amp; laden, to
come to him,<note place="margin">Mat. 11. 28</note> promising that he will ease
them?<note place="margin">Esa. 55. 1.</note> and such as are thirstie to come to
him,<note place="margin">Ioh. 4. 14.</note> and he wil giue them of the water of
life to drink,<note place="margin">Esa. 61. 1</note> quhilk sal spring vp into ever
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:19417:46"/>
lasting life?<note place="margin">Luke 4. 18.</note> yea, certenly his very office is
&amp; for that effect was he sent in the warld
by his father; to heal the broken hearted,
to preach deliverance to the captiues, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
of sight to the blind, &amp; to set at
libertie them that are in prison. Farther,
dois not the Lord assure vs, that so soone
as ever a sinner sal repent him of his sins,
from the bottome of his heart; he wil put
away his wickednes out of his remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance?
And speking to his people be the
mouth of his prophet, he saith wash you,<note place="margin">Esa. 1. 16</note>
make you cleane; take away the euill of
your works from before my eies; cease to
do evill, learne to do wel; seek judgment,
releue the oppressed, judge the fatherles,
and defend the widdow: Come then, and
let vs reason togither (saith the Lorde)
Though your sins were as crimsin, they
salbe made white as snowe: Though they
were red, like skarlet, they salbe as wooll.
Besides this, he hes commandit vs by the
mouth of the Psalmist, saying, Call on
me in the day of thy trouble,<note place="margin">Psal. 50. 15</note> so wil I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
thee, and thou shalt glorifie me.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:19417:47"/>
Are not these also the vndoubted words
of our saviour speaking to his Disciples?
Verely,<note place="margin">Ioh. 16. 23.</note> verely, I say vnto you, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
ye sal ask the Father in my name,
he wil giue it you: ask, and ye sal receiue,
that your joye may be made full. What
more gracious &amp; comfortable promises
can the heart of man wish, nor these? Or
what greter assurance wald thou haue of
the mercie and compassion of the Lord,
toward penitent sinners, nor this quhilk
hee giues thee in expresse tearmes, with
his own mouth? whereof one jote sal not
faile: for he cannot lie. But I knowe thou
wilt haue recourse to predestination, to
the secret election, &amp; reprobation of God,
and is perswaded with thy selfe, that thou
art one of them whome God hes forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
&amp; casten away. O foole! quhilk cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies
thy selfe (to thine own damnation)
of that quhilk is hid, not only to man on
earth, but also to the very Angels in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen:
For whome hes the Lord admitted
on his secreit counsell to knowe them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
whome hee hes chosen, or them whome
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:19417:47"/>
he hes forsaken? Nay, nay, that knowledg
is reserved only to himselfe. Therfore, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
thy affliction be never so great, thy
sins never so hainous, thy repentance &amp;
amendment never so small, and thy faith
never so weak: yet, neither thou, nor any
mortal man can conclude, absolutly, that
thou art reprobate, and forsaken of God.
My reason is this, Because it is vnknown
to thee, or to any man, when it may plese
God to call thee to repentance, when he
will instrengthen thy faith, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
forgiue thy sins, and bring thee
to his kingdom. Why art thou then dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged,
and dispaired of thy salvation
for the bitternes of thine afflictioun, for
the multitude, and gravitie of thy sinnes,
for the slacknes of thine amendement, or
weaknes of thy faith; considdering, that
none of these tokens canne import the
necessitie of thy reprobation? For thou
knawis, that affliction hes ever ben most
proper to the children of God, from the
beginning of the world. As to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
&amp; waight of thy sins, They can be no
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:19417:48"/>
hinderance to the mercie of God: In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
that where it pleaseth the Lord to
shew mercie, it is no more difficil to him
to remit innumerable sins, of whatsoever
gravitie and waight; nor to forgiue the
least offence that man can commit: The
whol generation of mankind, was shut vp
in sin,<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 23.</note> and was sinfull out of measure: But
of the free mercie of God, the sins of the
worlde were taken away, by the death of
Iesus Christ: In such sort, that all that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents
them of their sins, and beleeues in
him the saviour, sal obtain free remission
of al their sins whatsoever. Now, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
thy repentance &amp; amendement
of life; art thou dismaid, &amp; dispaired of thy
salvation, because thou cannot abstaine
from sin, nor attaine to a perfect vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes?
Surely thou hes na just occasion: For
no flesh can be without sin, nor attaine to
a perfection in this life.<note place="margin">Pro. 24. 16.</note> The most vpricht
man (saith <hi>Salomon</hi>) falls every day seaven
times;<note place="margin">Iob. 4. 18.</note> &amp; the very Angels ar not without
spot in the sight of the everliving God.<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 30.</note>
Knowest thou not, that man can not be
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:19417:48"/>
justified by the workes of the Lawe? Na,
doubtles,<note place="margin">Psa. 143. 2.</note> if the Lord will enter in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with man, &amp; deal with him accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the precise rule of his law; no flesh
suld be saued: For albeit the lawe of God
be set before vs, as a rule whereunto wee
suld apply and confer all our actions: yet
are we not any more vnder the lawe, but
in the estate of grace through the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of Iesus Christ. And albeit the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of God haue his law deeply imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in their harts, &amp; likes wel to keep the
same:<note place="margin">Galat. 3. 11</note> yet sall they not be counted righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
for fulfilling thereof, as though they
had deserved everlasting life,<note place="margin">Act. 13. 39.</note> seeing no
man ever fulfilled the Lawe: But because
they beleeue, that they are redeemed by
the blood of Iesus Christ, who hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished
the law in all points, and hes
merited all good things of his Father for
vs: Therefore, the Children of God sall
be justified, and receiue eternall life. If
then thou bee sory, that thou can not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
thy life, if thou haue ane earnest,
desire, and bent intention to doe good,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:19417:49"/>
and eschew evill, ioyned with a true faith
in Iesus christ: assure thy self, that the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God works that in thee, &amp; that it sal
be impute vnto thee for righteousnes, &amp;
that the Lord in his own appointed time
sall make that desire, and intention to be
effectuall, bringing forth good works to
amendment of life. What canst thou say
farther? that thou art daily relaps in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
sins, from the quhilk thou cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine;
and that neither thy sorrow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
nor thy desire to abstaine, are any
thing earnest &amp; notable. Indeede, if so be
thou art in an evill cace for the present.
Nevertheles, there is yet no cause here of
desperation: Forasmuch as none can tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
repent while they be called of the lord
to repentance. No man can come to me,
(saith our saviour) except the Father that
sent me,<note place="margin">Iohn. 6. 44.</note> drawe him. Seeing then, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
is not the gift of man, but of God;
&amp; that thou knowest not the time, when
it sall please the Lord to call and convert
thee: Thou ought in no wise to dispaire,
but to liue continually in gude hope, dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:19417:49"/>
attending thy calling and conversion.
Hes thou not heard the Parable of the la<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bourers
in the Vineyard,<note place="margin">Mat. 20. 1.</note> That he quhilk
came at the last hour of the day, received
equall wages, with him that came in the
morning? whereby our saviour signifies
vnto vs, that there is no time of mans life
at the quhilk the Lord wil not cal &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
man vnto him. I haue heard of some
men, quhilk at the latter houre on their
deathbed, being put in remembrance of
their god, by the assistants; hes burst forth
with horrible blasphemies against God,
and vttered words of plaine desperation.
But in ane instant, through the singular
mercy of God, &amp; fervent praier of the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistants,
was converted to the Lorde, by
lamenting carefully such blasphemies,
by making manifest declaration of their
faith in Iesus Christ, and giuing al liuely
signs of their election, departed plesant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
&amp; in a happy estat to the sight of men.
VVhen <hi>Paul</hi> wasted the Kirk of Christ, &amp;
persecuted his Saints,<note place="margin">Act. 9. 1.</note> both men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
to the death; who wald haue thoght
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:19417:50"/>
but that he had bin a reprobat, &amp; a fagot
prepared for hell? Nevertheles, hee was
called to repentance, &amp; was made a cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
vessell of the Lord. Who wald haue
said,<note place="margin">Mat. 26. 69</note> but that <hi>Peter</hi> had bin the son of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and that there could be no salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for him; when after hee was called to
be one of the disciples of Iesus christ, had
bene sa long conversant with him, had
heard his doctrine, seene his miracles, &amp;
confessed that he was the very Christ of
God: For all this, he denied him thrise on
a night? Notwithstanding, he came to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
that same night, was accepted
of the Lord, &amp; made a notable Apostle, &amp;
Preacher of the Evangel of Iesus Christ,
both to the Iews &amp; Gentils. Finally, who
wald not haue thought, but the Gentills
had bene forsaken of God, &amp; predestinat
to eternall damnation, quhilk baith mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knew
God, and committit al kind of abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
vnder heven? Yet the Lord for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
al their iniquities, and of his infinite
mercie brought them to the knowledge
of him, of his Sonne Christ Iesus, &amp; cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:19417:50"/>
them to be partakers of his caelestiall
kingdome. Haue we not also seene in our
daies, men of maist disolute &amp; licentious
liues, quhilk afterward beeing converted
&amp; sanctified by the spirit of God, hes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
notable &amp; profitable members of
the Kirk of Iesus Christ? Heirfoir, albeit
such as leads a life repugnant to the Law
of the Lord, may be justly counted repro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bates
with this restriction, except they
turne to God by repentance: nevertheles,
let no man condemne absolutely, either
himself, or his neighbor before his deth:
because there is nothing in any man, but
corruption &amp; sin, til he be sanctified, and
regenerate by the spirit of God; the time
whereof none knowes but God only:<note place="margin">Iohn. 3. 8</note> for
as the wind blowes where it listeth, so is
every man that is borne of the spirite. I
come nowe to thy faith, quhilk because
thou finds it weake, and full of doubting,
thou art dispaird of thy salvation. Indeed
the truth is, that no man can be saved vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
he beleeue: But if al were condemned
whose faith is weake, &amp; doubtfull; I pray
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:19417:51"/>
thee then tel me who suld be saved? when
the Disciples of Iesus Christ inquired of
him,<note place="margin">Mat. 17. 19</note> why they could not cast the Devill
out of the Lunatik person; he answered,
becaus of their vnbeleef: and declared to
them, that if their faith had bene as mei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kill
as a graine of mustard seede, they suld
remoue mountains, &amp; that nothing suld
be impossible to them. Farther, albeit our
Saviour had oftimes instructed his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
and forewarned them with his own
mouth, that he wald rise againe on the 3.
day after his death. Nevertheles, when
<hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> told them of his resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,<note place="margin">Mark. 16. 11. 12.</note>
&amp; that he had apeared to her, they
beleeved it not: Thereafter, he appeared
to two of themselues, quhilk shewe it to
the remnant, but they beleuit it not: yea,
after he had shawin himself to the eleven
in <hi>Galile,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 28. 17</note> yet some of them were in doubt
and beleeved not.<note place="margin">Luc. 24. 41</note> If this weaknes of faith
then, &amp; doubting was in the disciples of
Christ, who notwithstanding shall sit on
twelue throans,<note place="margin">Mat. 19. 28</note> &amp; judg the twelue tribes
of Israell, when the Lord shall sit on the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:19417:51"/>
throane of his Majestie: What cause hes
thou, O nauchtie man! to be dispaired of
thy salvation, althogh thy faith be weak,
and full of doubts? Certainly, if thy faith
continued as weak as the faith of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciple
<hi>Thomas,</hi> quhilk wald not beleeue
the resurrection of Iesus, whil he put his
finger in the wound of his hands, and of
his side; thou might think that thou were
in an evil cace:<note place="margin">Ioh. 20. 27.</note> But seing <hi>Thomas</hi> after he
had seene Christ beleued, &amp; was blessed;
Blessed art thou if thou beleeue in him,
quhilk saw him never. What sal I speak of
the waknes, dulnes, &amp; ignorance of man?
The haill Apostles after the ascension of
Iesus Christ,<note place="margin">Act. 11. 2.</note> For all their reading of the
scriptures, and doctrine quhilk they had
heard of his mouth; were ignorant of the
caling of the <hi>Gentils,</hi> &amp; knew not that the
Evangel suld be preached to them, till it
was first shewd to <hi>Peter</hi> in a vision, quhilk
thereafter declarit the mistery &amp; circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
thereof to the rest, beeing assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
at <hi>Ierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> O! But thou wil say, I feel
no spunk of faith in me, I feele the wrath
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:19417:52"/>
of God kindled aganis me, and a strong
perswasion that he hes forsaken me. Thir
ar hard sayings: but I haue alredy shewen
thee the cause of this thy perswasion; To
wit, becaus the Lord hes hid his face from
thee for a little while; to humble thee, to
try thy patience, &amp; to let thee know how
miserable thy estate wald be, if thou were
altogither destitute of his favour. But I
pray thee, remember, what thou beleued
before thou entered in this troble, before
the Lord hid his face from thee: and haue
not respect what thou beleeues now, but
what thou beleeuedst then. And if at any
time of thy life thou beleeved assuredly,
that Iesus christ hes suffered deth for thy
redemption: thou may certifie thy selfe,
that the Lord sal turne his loving counte
nance towards thee, &amp; that then thou sal
receiue that same faith againe in greater
mesure. Mairover, it is to be vnderstand,
that mans election, &amp; reprobation ar not
ruled according to mans own Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
For who liues in greater securitie,
(in their own conceipt) who brags faster
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:19417:52"/>
of their faith, and perswades themselues
more of Gods favour, nor the most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane,
and godles livers? Will they not
boldly &amp; confidently say, that they dout
nothing of their salvation, but thinks to
be as high in heven, as any other? When
nevertheles they are running a course di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
contrary to the ordinance of God.
The Iewes spake hardly to Christ &amp; said,
that they were not borne of fornication,<note place="margin">Ioh. 8. 41.</note>
but had a father, quhilk was God. But Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
answered them, that if God had bene
their father, they would haue loued him,
who proceeded from God: Quhilk seing
they did not; he declarit vnto them, that
they were of their father the deuil. By the
contrary, there is none that hes a greater
feling of their own sin, ar sorer troubled
with tentations, &amp; doubtings (as thou art
presently nowe) nor the dearest servants
of God. Example of <hi>David, Hezekiah,
Iob,</hi> the Prophetes and Apostles, and
a number of notable men in these our
daies, whereof the particulars were long
in this plaice, to alledge. VVherefore,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:19417:53"/>
gird vp thy loines, like a man, &amp; comfort
thy self in these things: ground &amp; repose
thy self in the merciful promises of God,
and merits of his Son Iesus Christ: And
not on thine own fantasies, &amp; vaine ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations.
And if thou wald be counted
the Son of God, submit thee willingly to
his correction: If thou would receiue a
crowne of glory, fight valiantly, &amp; be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious:
If thou would receiue the holy
Ghost, cleanse thy hart, &amp; be lowly min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:
If thou would be exalted for ever to
reigne with Christ on his throne, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to be cast downe, &amp; paciently to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
with him: For by these degrees of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie
thou mon passe &amp; ascend to the

haue patience, yet a little while, and thou
sall see great things:<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 11</note> For albeit no chaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
seemeth joyous, but grievous for the

               <p>AL men that are in troble or in pain,
wald gladly vnderstand when their
paine &amp; trouble suld take an end: And in
speciall, they that hes an inward trouble
of the mind, that hes a paine in their soul
&amp; <hi>Conscience,</hi> and a feling of Gods wrath,
burning aganis them, that are maist desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

know how long their paine &amp; troble will
indure. All men (I say) wald hear of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
&amp; releefe: but fewe hes regard howe
long they haue rebelled agains God, how
long they haue followit the affections of
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:19417:54"/>
their own heart, and hes refusit to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by Gods holy word &amp; discipline.
Were it not then good reason, O man!
that the Lord punished thee as long, as he
hes suffered thee? and that thy paine suld
continue as long, as thou hes continued
in thy sin and rebellions? But it is with a
mercifull partie thou hes to do, quhilk is
slow to anger, &amp; redie to forgiue; whose
clemencie I would exhort thee not to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse,
but to comfort thy self in it: For he
is also just in his judgements;<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 31</note> and it is a
fearefull thing to fall in his hands. He hes
shewen thee himselfe, when he wil forget
thine iniquities; to wit, even then, when
thou turns to him by earnest &amp; vnfained
repentance: But as to the time, when the
inward paine of thy <hi>Conscience</hi> sall cease,
and thou receiue peace thereof, It is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne
to man: yea, it is als vncertaine
when the Lord will remoue his scourge
&amp; punishment, as it is vncertain when he
will lay it on: For it is to be marked, that
the chastisement is not alwaies removed
so soone as the sin is remitted: but for the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:19417:54"/>
singular weill and profit of the offender,
wil continue to work patience in him, &amp;
to serue as a bridle to refraine him from
falling in the like offences; while the Lord
haue sufficiently purified him from such
corruption.<note place="margin">2. Sam. 12. 10. 14.</note> When <hi>David</hi> committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery

The man of God, <hi>Dauid</hi> saith, that he was

and that his eies were blinded with look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for the Lords deliverance: If then he
suffered so long, thou suld not dispair al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
thine affliction appeare longsome,
but rather suld be content to suffer with
the elect vessel of god. Alwaies thou may
comfort thy selfe in this; that the lower
thou be brought, the greter thy torment
be, &amp; the longer it continue; apparantly,
when the releif comes, thy comfort and
exaltation salbe the mair notabil &amp; gret.
Bot what matter is it, when thy delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
be, if thou haif certification of gods

Considering, that al the pain quhilk
thou can suffer in this life, is not worthy
of that glory quhilk the Lord hes prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for al them that loues him. Prescribe
not therfore any time of thy deliverance,
neither think that the Lord is slow: for he
hes his own appointit time for al things;
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:19417:55"/>
and when thou art farthest casten down, &amp;
hes given over al hope of warldly help, &amp;
reposis on thy God only, then is the Lord
neerest vnto thee, to comfort and deliuer
thee. Now as to the maner &amp; forme how
the trouble of mans <hi>conscience</hi> passis away,
and true peace enters in; It is obserued in
som persons to be this: There wil preceid
&amp; go before, an earnest repentance of the
evil past, &amp; a fervent desire to amend, &amp; do
wel: Man wil be heavily displesit with him
selfe for his foul deffections, &amp; wil tak a de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>terminat
resolution to reforme his life, &amp;
to do that quhilk is plesant in the sight of
God; In sik sort, that throgh fervencie and
grief, he wil feel an extreame dolor, &amp; wil
weep bitterly: Yea, he that before could
never wring out a tear, nor be perfitly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
for his sin; when the spirit of God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in &amp; pearsis the heart, he sal be liuely
touched, sair grieued, &amp; sal not be able to
containe himself, nor to refrain from wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping.
Nixt after sik perturbation, will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
a calmnes &amp; quietnes of the mind; &amp;
suddenly wil arise a sure perswasion in the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:19417:56"/>
heart of the favour of God, and of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of sins: quhilk sall bring with it an
exceeding great gladnes and reviuing of
the spirit. Man wil then begin to banish all
vaine feare &amp; superstition in his doings; &amp;
with greter confidence will vse a christian
libertie in doing of thinges lawefull to be
done; his feare will be no more servile, but
childish: For he wil not then fear the Lord,
as the servant fears his awful master, or as
the criminal person fears the terribil judg:
But as the Son feares to offend his loving
father; so wil he (being inflamed with loue
and fervent zeall) feare to offend the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie
of his good God. Farther, he wil cum
with a greter assurance to the Lord, in ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>king
his supplications: and wil not be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
with such vaine cogitations &amp; doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings;
as he was, when his <hi>Conscience</hi> was
weak &amp; wounded. To be short, hee will be
mair constant nor of before, &amp; wil haue a
certain contentment &amp; rejoicing in al his
actions, joined with the testimony of a gud
and peaceable <hi>Conscience:</hi> yea, hauing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
this inwarde tranquilitie &amp; peace,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:19417:56"/>
man wil think himselfe so strong and sure,
that he sall never be troubled againe, with
the like accusation &amp; terrour of his <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi>
But leist any suld be deceived in this
point; It is to be vnderstand, that so soone
as ever it sall please the Lord to turn away
his favorable face, to shew his angry coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tenance,
and to menace man for sinne, so
soone sal newe terrours &amp; torment of the
spirit and <hi>Conscience</hi> arise again. The cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
vessell of God,<note place="margin">Psal. 30. 6</note> King <hi>David,</hi> saide in his
prosperitie, I sal never be moved: but thou
Lord (saith he) didst hide thy face, &amp; I was
troubled. Therefore when thou hes recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
hevenly consolation, look not to keep
it at thy pleasure: For temptation ceaseth
not any long time, neither is that comfort
laudable, but to be feared, quhilk makes a
man to forget his sin altogither. The Lord
cures his elect by temptation, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.
And Iob saith,<note place="margin">Iob. 7. 18.</note> that the Lord dois vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
man every morning, and tries him
every moment. I knowe a notable Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
of Gods worde (whome I doubt not
but God hes ordained for his kingdome)
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:19417:57"/>
who being sum time sore afflicted in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi>
at last obtained comfort, &amp; had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
peace for the space of many yeares.
Nevertheles, at the plesure of the Lord, he
was visited again of new; and divers &amp; sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie
times wald be for the space of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
or two, grievously troubled: Of this
same man, while he was yet in good estat,
I inquired, how he reposed in the night: I
wil take reasonable good rest (saith he) If
God make vs not to remember the faults
quhilk wee haue committed in our youth:
Yea, surely, when it pleasis the Lord at any
time, to present mans sinns before him, in
their vgliest form, &amp; therewithall to perce
the heart; albeit man thocht himself in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so great securitie, and confidit never sa
meikil in his own constancie, &amp; strength:
yet the sight thereof sal ever trouble him,
after an extraordinar maner. Heirfore, my
dear brother, when new trouble arisis, and
when thou feelest a want of the favour of
God; be not dismaied nor despaired: For it
is no new thing;<note place="margin">Iohn. 3. 9.</note> but a thing costomable to
the dearest servants of God. The spirit of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:19417:57"/>
God goes and comes at his pleasure, but
will never abandon his Elect altogether.
Seing then, that the whol course of a chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
life, is but a continuall battel, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
falling by sin, and rising by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:
And that the Lord will not suffer
the <hi>Consciences</hi> of his servaunts to be long
vnexercised: I wil now shew thee my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
howe thou suld behaue thy selfe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

hes employ it the day preceiding. Examin

dominion over any of thy vnruly affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;

seek first the kingdome of God,<note place="margin">Mat. 6. 33.</note> &amp; his
righteosnes (which is amendment of life)
and then sall these worldly things be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
ministred vnto thee. Respect not
thine owne commoditie in serving God;
neither make thy dependance on him, in
hope of a temporall rewarde: But respect
cheifly his glory, let thy service tend al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
to please him, &amp; that in hope of an
everlasting recompense. Thinke not that
thou art placed by God here vpon earth,
to liue at libertie, to enjoy thy plesures, or
to make long residence: but only to serue
him, looking for nothing in this life, but
for affliction,<note place="margin">Ioh. 16. 33.</note> &amp; that as a pilgrim &amp; stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

If the Lord bestow his temporal
benefits on thee, or grant thee any repose
&amp; contentment in this life, be thankful to
him therefore, &amp; vse his gifts to his glory:

for conclusion of this tretise, besides
all the precepts before rehearsed: there is
yet a thing wherof I wald admonish thee;
quhilk in the mercies of God, I beseech
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:19417:60"/>
thee to remark, and exactly to cary away:
having obtained peace of <hi>Conscience,</hi> whil
thy spirit is yet at rest, take pen &amp; ink, and
spedily write vp, for a memoriall, the time
&amp; maner of thy trouble, and of thy delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;
yea, whether thou can write or not,
imprint it deeply in thy heart &amp; memory;
and for all the daies of thy life, let it serue
thee for these vses. First, so oft as ever thou
reades it, or calls it to remembrance, let it
serue as a perpetuall lesson, to learne thee
to be thankful to thy God. Secondly, let it
serue, as a perpetual bridle, to refrain thee
from sin, &amp; offending the majestie of god:
Certifying thy self that if thou be ingrate,
or delight in wickednes, the Lord hes ever
the same wand aboue thy head, wherwith
he wil scourge thee againe mair viuely, &amp;
wil make thy own <hi>Conscience</hi> a bourior to
torment thee. Thirdly, where ever it shall
please the Lord to cast thee againe in the
like trouble, then collect this document,
and comfort: Assure thy selfe, that if thou
seek to him with al thy heart &amp; with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance;
as he delivered thee of before, so
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:19417:61"/>
wil he deliver thee again at al times there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
vnto the end of thy life: For the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of God is without repentance.<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 29</note>
               </p>
               <p>Now, my deare brother, let not this be
thy behaviour, &amp; exercise, for a day, or for
a short time onely: but see thou continue
therein during all the daies of thy life: In
respect, the reprobat &amp; wicked man, sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
for feare of the Lords judgements,
sumtime to be releved of his present paine
and trouble, sumtime to get his intention
accomplished, or vpon other worldly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects,
will haue good motions, &amp; wil be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
a good course: but so soon as the Lord
dois avert his plague, so soone as he is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of his paine, or comes to his intent; so
soon returns he to his former impietie, &amp;
vpon light occasions falles suddenly and
shamefully back. Be thou not therfore like
to him, but as a good soldier of the Lord,
endure and persevere constantly vnto the
end,<note place="margin">Mat. 23. 13</note> that thou may be saved and inherit all

of my sins, a liuely sorrow in my heart for
the same, a fervent desire to abstaine from

For thereby, thou hes tamed, &amp; humbled

Thou hes drawn me vnto thee, as it were,

Thou hes brought me from the doore of

loue, &amp; of my adoption &amp; salvation. These
benefits, O heavenly Father! and al other
good thinges<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I acknowledge me to haue
received, and to receiue daily of thy only
goodnes, &amp; bountiful hand: for the quhilk
I render vnto thee, that quhilk thou hes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
giuen me; even my heart, my soule, my
affection, and my strength, with al thanks:
For lo! they appertaine justly vnto thee,
the fountaine of all goodnes, and original
of my being: I dedicate my life, &amp; service
to thee, and wil vowe my selfe thy servant
for ever.</p>
               <p>But now, my God, I stil remain in great
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:19417:63"/>
danger, &amp; distres; and vnles thou preserue
me, I am but lost; vnles thou vphold me, I
am not able to stand: For so long as I am
in this tabernacle, I am but poor, weak, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,
impacient, &amp; imperfit: So long as
I am in this vail of misery, I am daily assal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
within, &amp; without, with manifold ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations;
with the intisements of the world,
with the snares of the diuel, with the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of men, and raging of mine own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence:
If thou take thy good gifts fra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me;
I sal stand vp poore, naked, &amp; misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bil:
If thou tak thy spirit &amp; grace from me
I sal then doutles fal suddenly, &amp; be a pray
to my enemies foresaids. Haue mercie on
me therefore (O Lord) for Iesus Christ thy
deare sons sake; &amp; let me not be overcum,
nor drawen from thee with the trifles, and
entisements of the world; by the power &amp;
subtiltie of Sathan; by the fellowship, or
provocation of men; nor by the vnrulines
of my corrupted affections. But as thou
hes wrocht that great work of my redemp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion,
by the deth of thine only son, so work
likewise, &amp; accomplish the work of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:19417:63"/>
by the vertue of thy holy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
By the mightie operation of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter,
make my heart new within me; my
stubborne, and polluted heart, pearce it,
purge it, mollifie it, enlarge it, frame and
fashion it to thy holy wil: Crucifie the old
man, quicken the new man; bridle, &amp; mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
my sinful lusts and natural affections,
that they be not inordinate nor excessiue;
but make them alwaies obedient &amp; subject
to my spirit, &amp; my spirit to thy spirit. Let
thy word &amp; wil, be a precise rule to al my
deeds, my words, my thoughts, my appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites,
&amp; desires. Let me be daily renewed,
comforted, instructed, instrenthened, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
and governed by the spirit of truth,
till I come to the ful perfection; and albeit
Lord, I cannot be altogither without sin,
so long as I am clad with flesh and blood;
yet, let not sin raigne, nor haue the vpper,
hand in me; but so oft as I fal by sin, als oft
raise thou me vp again by repentance: san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
my soul, good Lord, my wit, &amp; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
that I may be alwaies occupied in
thy service: purifie, &amp; blesse my body and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:19417:64"/>
members, quhilk ar defiled with the works
of the flesh, that I may be a meet and well
prepared temple of the holy Ghost: Blesse
likewise, &amp; prosper, acording to thy good
pleasure, mine interprises, proceedings,
and works of my hands, that it may go wel
with me. Dresse my affaires, and put them
in good order: Preserue me alwaies, that I
attempt nothing repugnant to thy holy
will; let thy will, be my will (my God) And
whatsoeuer succes my proceedings take;
whatsoever crosse or affliction it sal please
thy majestie to lay on me; make me harti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
wel content therwith. For thou knawis
what is good for me. As concerning tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
benefits, I craue them onely in such
number and measure as seemeth good in
thine eies: Giue mee those things quhilk
thy wisdome knowes to be most expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for me: seeing thou knowest whereof I
haue need. Alwaies, Lord, let me not lack
the thing without the quhilk I canot serue
thee: but grant me thy blessing, thy favor,
&amp; thy grace, and then I sall haue enough.</p>
               <p>Arme me, O heavenly Father! with spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:19417:64"/>
armour, in this great conflict, and
high tentations: Giue me a true, liuely,
and justifying faith, whereby, I may stand
stedfast in all assaults, &amp; quenche the fiery
darts of Sathan: Imprint thy true feare in
my heart, and let me be replenished with
thy fervent loue: Giue me patience, and
long suffering, vnto the end of the battell;
humilitie and meeknes, giue me a humble
heart, and a lowlie mind, a forgiuing hart,
a penitent heart for my sin; a pliable hart,
will, and mind, to thy voice, thy word, and
thy wil; and a thankful heart for thy bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites;
Lord, let them never slide out of my
mind. Giue me sobernes, temperance, con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stancie,
truth, vprightnes, contentment of
mind, peace of <hi>Conscience,</hi> charitie &amp; loue
towards al men for thy sake: That I be not
onely a hearer, reader, and vnderstander
of thy word; but also, a keeper and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
of thy word and commandements.</p>
               <p>These things, I craue of thee, my God,
in the name of thy son Iesus christ: For so
he hes commanded me to do, promising,
that thou wilt graunt my petitions for his
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:19417:65"/>
sake. But, Lord, my mouth is not able to
expresse, my heart to vnderstand, nor my
thocht abil to conceiue the hundreth part
of those things, whereof I haue neede and
ought to do. Heirfore, let the comforter,
teach me, &amp; put me in remembrance of al
things,<note place="margin">loh. 14. 26.</note> as thy dear son hes promised; that
both in prosperitie, &amp; adversitie I may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue
my self as one of thy good soldiers &amp;
faithfull servants, to the end of my course
and race. Be thou ever my strong rock, my
buckler, &amp; my sheild; and then though the
world suld turne vpside down; yet sall I be
in perpetuall securitie. Be on my side, and
neither man, nor the devil salbe able to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow
me. Giue me everlasting life, O
Lord! that after this life be ended, I may
dwell with thee in thy kingdome, behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
thy glorious face, magnifying, and
praising thee, thy Lamb Iesus Christ, and
the Comforter thy holy Spirit; togither
with thy chosen children, &amp; armies of thy
bright Angels, for ever, and ever, worlde
without end.</p>
