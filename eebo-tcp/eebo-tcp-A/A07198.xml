            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ourteous Reader, whereas
heretofore my slender wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
published to the world,
and my Sermons in that Royall Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
have been in part <hi>polemical,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countring
with some controversies of
these times; it pleased God this last
year so to inflict upon me that tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
paine which is incident to students,
and doth commonly accompany a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentary
life, that I did interpret is as
an Angel sent from God to put me in
minde of my mortality. Whereupon I
resolved to divert my course from dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
to devotion, from controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
to conscience, and from henceforth
to labour to worke in my selfe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb facs="tcp:12742:3"/>
true mortification, and sanctified
affections; and accordingly to temper
both my study and my stile.</p>
            <p>Wherfore, being called by my ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
course of attendance to preach in
that eminent place; first of all, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
what sins are likely to be found
in Princes Courts. And among sundry
other, two especially did offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to my cogitation; carnall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence,
and politick Practices. For,
where there is pomp in apparell, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie
in diet, and beautifull obiects, all
concurring many times with idlenesse
and ease<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there a man walketh in the
midst of snares, and is in danger to be
set in combustion with the fiery darts
of the Divell. Againe, Kings houses
being not onely places of pleasure, but
also ever-flowing fountaines of profit
and preferment: no marvaile if nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
wits doe there set themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke,
to attaine their owne endes, and
politickly to supplant all those that
<pb facs="tcp:12742:3"/>
stand in their way, or hinder their
proiects. For, that they doe so, will be
evident, as I suppose, by the Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of all Kingdomes and Countries.</p>
            <p>Now, though the English Court,
guided by so godly and gracious a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne,
bee of all other most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markeable
for learned preaching, reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
prayers, and angelicall lauding
and praising of God with spirituall
Hymns, and ravishing straines of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodious
musick: though it be beautified
and adorned with a most worthy gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
of sage Senatours, Nobles and
Gentlemen: Yet I dare not altogether
exempt it from such sinnes as have
alwaies beene incident, more or lesse,
to the Palaces of Princes. Therefore
in the second place, I sought such a
Text as might lead mee by the hand to
reproove those vices: and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
I laid hould upon the story of
King <hi>David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But though <hi>David</hi> were a King,
<pb facs="tcp:12742:4"/>
yet I did not therefore single him out
because hee was a King: neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
I, preaching before a King, to
take occasion by King <hi>David</hi> to glanse
in any wise at the sacred persons of
Princes: God forbid. For our King
(God be thanked) though in the highest
pitch of worldly prosperitie, is for cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity
another <hi>Ioseph.</hi> And though hee
be for wisedome like an Angel of God,
and can dive into the depth of humane
policies: yet hee loveth and practiseth
sincerity in all his dealings; like to
<hi>Nathanael</hi> the true Israelite, in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
was no guile. But, I proposed <hi>David,</hi>
as a generall glasse of humane frailty,
wherein all men may behold their own
imbecillity.</p>
            <p>Neither had I any purpose when I
preached these Sermons to publish them
to the world: but it pleased the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
to vouchsafe a blessing beyond
expectation. For hee that caused the
hearts of the Disciples to burne within<note place="margin">Luk. 24 32</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:12742:4"/>
them while hee opened the Scriptures
unto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as they went to Emmaus, did
in the riches of his mercy kindle some
such sparkles in the hearts of my hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.
Which I perceiving by the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of those which desired copies,
did at last yeeld to let them passe to the
Presse; being mindfull of that of the
Apostle,<note place="margin">Gal. 6. 10</note> 
               <hi>As wee have oportunity
let us doe good to all men, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
to those who are of the
household of faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover: wheras thou, gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
hast long expected my booke of the
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Bishops, which by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand
of authoritie was to bee translated into
Latin; I certifie thee, that I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
finished the translation; and, by
occasion of the opposition of my many
Antagonists who have written against
mee, much inlarged the Worke, and
prepared it for the Presse, under this
title; <hi>De ministerio Anglicano.</hi>
But, the childe being brought to the
<pb facs="tcp:12742:5"/>
birth, as yet there wanteth strength to
be delivered. Yet I hope, that our good
God in his due time will give it a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
issue. In the meane while, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy
these my poore labours, and giue
them leave to worke upon thine affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
And so I commend both thee &amp;
them to the blessing of God.</p>

FIRST SERMON,

               <q>And David sayd vnto

            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Eer are three things <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
in <hi>David</hi> to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
his sinne,
his repentance, and
his absolution. The
first thing is his sinne, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:12742:6"/>
in my Text (as it were)
with the point of a Diamond; and
that with such great and Capitall
Letters that a man may runne and
read it, in these words: AND
<hi>DAVID</hi> SAID VNTO <hi>NA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THAN,
PECCAVI DOMI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NO,</hi>
I HAVE SINNED A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GAINST
THE LORD.</p>
            <p>The second thing is his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
presented unto vs in the
selfe same words, being vttered
by way of lamentation, as though
he should say: It is true <hi>Nathan,</hi>
it is true that thou hast sayd, for I
confesse I have sinned: alas! I have
sinned most grievously, and that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Lord.</p>
            <p>The third thing is his absoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
pronounced in these words:
<hi>And Nathan sayd unto David, the
Lord also hath put away thy sinne,
thou shalt not dye.</hi> So first he sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
secondly hee repented, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:12742:6"/>
thirdly he was absolved. He sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
there was the corruption of
nature; he repented, there was the
operation of the Spirit; hee was
absolved, there was the unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
goodnesse of God. In his sin
let us behold our own frailety; in
his repentance, let us learne our
owne duty; in his absolution, let
us magnifie Gods mercy.</p>
            <p>The sinne of <hi>David</hi> reproued <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
by <hi>Nathan,</hi> and here confessed by
himselfe, was first of all that hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
sinne of adulterie, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
those other sinnes which
he committed, while he went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to hide and cloake his adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.
Of the former, at this time,
by the grace of Christ; of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidue
heereafter, when it shall
please the Lord. Now, that wee
may rightly understand the hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nousnesse
of his adultery, let vs
briefly ponder these foure points.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:12742:7"/>
1. The quality of the person, or
what manner of man this <hi>David</hi>
was which committed adultery.
2. With whom. 3. When. 4. How
he was plunged into this gulfe of
sinne.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The first point is the quality of
the person. Concerning which I
may truly affirme, that <hi>David</hi> was
the most eminent and remarkable
man that was then living upon
the face of the earth; for it was
famously knowne both to Iewes
and Gentiles, that the God of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
had been his continuall Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
and Defence, even from his
youth up. He had defended him
from a raging<note n="a" place="margin">1. Sam. 17. 34</note> Beare, from a roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<note n="b" place="margin">Ibid.</note> Lion, from a huge and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<note n="c" place="margin">1. Sam. 17. 4. 50</note> Giant, from the fury of the
<note n="d" place="margin">1. Sam. 18. 27. &amp; 23. 5</note> 
               <hi>Philistines,</hi> from the cruell perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of bloodthirsty<note n="e" place="margin">1. Sam. 18. 11. &amp; 23. 20. &amp; 24. 16. &amp; 26. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Saul,</hi> and
in a word, from a thousand dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.
And as the Lord had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:12742:7"/>
him about with gracious
deliverances, so he had crowned
him with blessings upon blessings,
temporal, spirituall, ordinarie, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary.
First, when he was a
poore Shepheard following the
Ewes, the Lord sent <hi>Samuel</hi> to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint
him<note n="a" place="margin">1. Sam. 16. 1</note> King over Israel. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
the Lord gave him a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
victory over<note n="b" place="margin">1. Sam. 17. 51</note> 
               <hi>Golias,</hi> all Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
did see it, and reioiced. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the Lord gave him honour in
the hearts of the people, so that
the women did sing in their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
<note n="c" place="margin">1. Sam. 18. 7</note> 
               <hi>Saul hath slaine his thousands,
&amp; David his ten thousands.</hi> Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the heart of<note n="d" place="margin">1. Sam. 18. 1</note> 
               <hi>Ionathan</hi> the
Kings sonne was knit vnto him:
for he loved him, even as his own
soule. Fiftly,<note n="e" place="margin">1. Sam. 18. 20.</note> 
               <hi>Michal</hi> the Kings
daughter loved him, so <hi>David</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
the Kings sonne in lawe.
And after the death of <hi>Saul</hi> and
<hi>Ionathan,</hi> the Lord advanced him
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:12742:8"/>
to the royal throne, the glittering
Diademe was set upon his head,
he raigned over<note n="f" place="margin">2. Sam. 5. 5</note> 
               <hi>Iuda</hi> seven yeers
and sixe moneths, and then over
all Israel even from <hi>Dan</hi> to <hi>Bershe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba.</hi>
Besides all this, the Lord gave
him plenty of<note n="g" place="margin">1. chr. 28</note> gold and silver,
and victory over all his<note n="h" place="margin">2. Sam. 7. 1</note> enemies,
so that his victorious banner was
displayed, even from Ierusalem to
the River Euphrates. Moreover,
he was a<note n="i" place="margin">Act. 2. 30</note> Prophet of the Lord,
a type of Christ, a Secretary of
the holy Ghost in penning those
sacred and mellifluous Psalms, he
was also the sweet Singer of Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,
and a Composer of those me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodious
harmonies that were used
in the Tabernacle of God: hee
was likewise one of the<note n="l" place="margin">act. 2. 29</note> Patriarks,
for so Saint <hi>Peter</hi> stiles him; and
God had<note n="m" place="margin">act. 2. 30</note> sworne unto him that
he should be one of the Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of Iesus Christ. Now for
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:12742:8"/>
inward gifts and graces, hee was
a Child of God, a member of
Christ, a Temple of the Holy
Ghost, a vessell of grace, a sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
Soul, a sweet and well tuned
Cymbal, a heavenly Organ of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall
sound; in all his workes
he prays'd the Lord with words
of glory, every Psalme breathing
religion and devotion; in so much
that God himselfe gave him this
testimony, that hee was a man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Gods owne<note n="n" place="margin">act. 13. 22</note> heart. O
what eminencie of grace, what
sublimitie of honour, what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence
of prerogatiues was
here! and yet for all this, <hi>David,</hi>
euen this <hi>David,</hi> committed adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie.</p>
            <p>Now, that we may make vse of
this example: first let vs obserue
the frailty and infirmity of man.
Behold, hee that was supposed to
be strong as a Lyon, and tall as a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:12742:9"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Cedar, was not only incountred,
but also conquered with a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
Wherefore in his frailety,
wee all may behold, as in a glasse,
the plaine image of our owne im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becillity;
for if the Lyon be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered,
what shall the little Lamb
doe? If the Cedars of Libanus
be shaken, what shall the tender
plant doe? Alas, what are wee if
God withdraw his grace? Even
the best man upon the face of the
earth, if he were left to himselfe,
should perish everlastingly. Look
upon Saint <hi>Peter:</hi> ô what a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and hye conceit had he of
himselfe! and yet for all his boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting,
hee did not onely deny, but
also forsweare his Master. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
lay away all presumption, let
no arogancy proceed out of your
mouth, but let every man co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider
his own infirmity, &amp; therby learn
a holy and a gracious humility.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:12742:9"/>
Secondly, let us observe the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
wherin we stand; for if <hi>David,</hi>
a man according to Gods owne
heart, were tempted, what man
upon the face of the earth can be
free from temptation? I confesse,
that all men are not tempted alike
to the same sinne of adultery. For
as our Saviour sayth; <hi>There are
some Eunuches which were so borne
from their mothers wombe:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 19. 12</note> but all
men are tempted to one sinne
or other. Now, where the banke
is lowest, there the water will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
where the wall is weakest,
there the enemy will batter; and
where man is weakest, there the
divell will soonest assault him: for
our adversarie is like to a cunning
fisherman, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>siders the natures
and inclinations of the fishes, and
accordingly baiteth his hooke. If
<hi>Iudas</hi> be covetous, the divell will
baite his hooke for him with thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:12742:10"/>
pieces of siluer. If <hi>Achan</hi> love
pride in apparell, the divell will
angle for him with a goodly Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonish
garment. If <hi>Absolon</hi>
be ambitious, the divell will seeke
to catch him with the hope of a
kingdome. Thus hee observeth
all, and accordingly he tempteth
all, and therefore looke for temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
whosoever thou art. Alas,
my brother, thou carriest sinfull
flesh and bloud about thee, and
dost thou thinke thou shalt not be
tempted? The world is full of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luring
provocations, and doest
thou think thou shalt not be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?
The divell goeth about like
a roaring Lion seeking whom hee
may devoure, and dost thou think
thou shalt not be tempted? Wee
have an enemy, sayth Saint<note n="a" place="margin">Epist. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,
Cui nomina mille, mille nocendi
artes, atque ego infoelix victorem me
putabo dum capior?</hi> He hath a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:12742:10"/>
names, and a thousand sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
devices to intrap and intangle
the soules of men, and I poore
wretch, shall I thinke my selfe a
Conquerour, even then when I
am taken captive? Beleeve me,
beleeve me, <hi>haec tranquillitas tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestas
est,</hi> this calme will proove a
storme: for even then thou art
tempted, when thou thinkest thou
art not tempted; nay therefore
thou art tempted, because thou
thinkest thy selfe free from temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
Our blessed Saviour, when
he taught his disciples to say; <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
vs our trespasses,</hi> hee taught
them likewise to say, <hi>And leade
vs not into temptation;</hi> thereby tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
us, that even those children
of God, whose trespasses are forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
are still notwithstanding sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
to temptation. Wherefore,
my sonne, when thou entrest into
the service of God, prepare thy
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:12742:11"/>
selfe for temptation.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Thirdly, seeing wee are all so
weake and yet walke in such dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
what is then to bee done?
That we may learne of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
<note n="b" place="margin">1. Cor. 10. 12</note> 
               <hi>Let him that thinketh he stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
take heed lest he fall.</hi> But how
shall we take heed? that we may
learne of our blessed Saviour,
when he sayth,<note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 26. 41</note> 
               <hi>Watch and Pray.</hi>
If the watch be neglected but one
night, the Citie may bee taken:
<hi>David</hi> had kept watch and ward
over his senses all his life time, and
now neglecting it but one Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
he is not onely incountred,
but carried away captive to the
lawe of sinne. Wherefore wee
had all neede to vse vigilancy and
circumspection. <hi>Watch therefore
and pray, that ye fall not into temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
The Spirit indeed is willing, but the
flesh is weake.</hi> And because it is
weake, therefore neglect no good
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:12742:11"/>
means that the Lord hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
And when thou hast done all
that thou canst, put no confidence
in thy selfe, but rely upon thy
God, saying; <hi>O knit my heart unto
thee, that I may feare thy name.</hi> And
thus much of the first point, <hi>viz.</hi>
the quality of the person which
committed adultery: now I come
to the second, that is, the partie
with whom.</p>
            <p>The understanding wherof wil <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
helpe vs to to discerne the nature
and quality of the sin. For if both
parties be single, it is single forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation:
but if both, or one of them
be either maried or contracted, <hi>in
verbis de praesenti,</hi> it is adulterie.
Wherby also it appears that there
are sundry degrees in adulterie;
but when a married man pollutes
a married woman, that is adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in the highest degree. Now,
with whom did <hi>David</hi> commit
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:12742:12"/>
this folly? was it with a single
woman? No, but with one<note n="a" place="margin">alias <hi>Bathshua</hi> 1. Chr. 3. 5</note> 
               <hi>Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheba,</hi>
an other mans wife. Then
it was more then single fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
it was adulterie. But was not
<hi>David</hi> himself also a married man?
Yes vndoubtedly. Then both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
were maried, and therefore it
was adultery in the highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.
Yea, and peradventure he
had moe wives then one. Verie
true, he had many wives when he
dwelt at<note n="b" place="margin">1. chr. 3. 5</note> Hebron, and yet hee
tooke him more when hee came
to<note n="c" place="margin">2. Sam. 5. 13</note> Ierusalem. And had hee so
ample a remedy against concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence,
and yet would transgresse
Gods holy ordinance, to eate of
the forbidden tree? Had hee so
many wives of his owne, and yet
would defile the one onely wife
of an other man? O most horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and execrable adulterie, and
that in the verie height of the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:12742:12"/>
highest degree! But whose wife
was she? She was the wife of one
<hi>Vrias,</hi> by Nation a Hittite, and
stranger from the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-wealth
of Israel; but by grace a Proselyte,
and an imbracer of the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
indeed a very holy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
man. He was by profession
a Souldier, a valiant Captaine,
and reckoned among the<note n="d" place="margin">2. Sam. 23. ver. vlt. 1. chr. 11. 41.</note> Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies
of <hi>David.</hi> But where was
he now? he was in the field at the
siege of <hi>Rabba</hi> of the Ammonites,
fighting for the glory of God, for
the Arke of the Covenant, for the
honour of his Prince, and for
the good of his Countrey. And
would such a man as <hi>David</hi> offer
such a wrong, to such a man, at
such a time? ô what a blemish &amp;
scandall was this for the Church
of God? ô tell it not in <hi>Gath,</hi> and
publish it not in the streets of <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kelon,</hi>
lest the Daughters of the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:12742:13"/>
Philistines reioice, and the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the uncircumcised tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph.
And thus much of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
point.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> But to come to the third point:
When did he thus forget himself
and transgresse the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
of the most High? To which
I answere, that the day and yeere
are not recorded in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
neither can they be precisely
collected out of the same. It see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
that the Holy Ghost did
passe them over of purpose, that
they might be covered with eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
darkness, and everlastingly
buried in the lake of oblivion.
Wherfore let not that yeare bee
measured with the motion of the
sunne, let not that be numbred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the dayes of the yeare, in
that evening let no starre shine,
wherein such a shining starre was
eclipsed, and let that night for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:12742:13"/>
remaine in darkness, wherein
was committed such a worke of
darknes.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding, though wee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/>
cannot define the time in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular;
yet we may describe it in
generall, by three circumstances.
For <hi>David</hi> incurred this sinne in
his declining age, during the
time of the warres with the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monites,</hi>
he him selfe then lying at
home in Ierusalem in plenty and
prosperity, idleness &amp; ease. First,
it happened in his declining age:
for <hi>David</hi> was thirty<note n="e" place="margin">2 Sam. 5. 4. 5</note> years old
when hee began to raigne, and he
raigned in <hi>Hebron</hi> seaven yeares
and six moneths; and then hee
raigned in Ierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. After which
time, first, hee wonne the fort of
<note n="a" place="margin">2 Sam. 5. 7</note> Sion &amp; expelled the Iebusites.
Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, he overcame the<note n="b" place="margin">2 Sam. 5 20. and 5 25. and 8. 1</note> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listines
in three sundry battells.
Thirdly, hee smote<note n="c" place="margin">2 Sam. 8 2</note> the Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:12742:14"/>
and measured them with
lines. Fourthly, hee spoyled the
children both of<note n="d" place="margin">2 Sam. 8 12</note> 
               <hi>Ammon</hi> and
<note n="e" place="margin">ibid.</note> 
               <hi>Amalec.</hi> Fitftly, hee fought a
great battell with<note n="f" place="margin">2 Sam. 8 3</note> 
               <hi>Hadadezer</hi>
King of Zobah in Armenia, vpon
the river Euphrates; and he tooke
from him a thousand Chariots,
seaven hundred horsemen, and
twenty thousand footmen. And
when the Syrians of Damascus
came to succor <hi>Hadadezer, David</hi>
slew of them two &amp; twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand,
and put garrisons in Syria
Damascena. Sixtly, hee vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
Idumaea and put garrisons in
<note n="g" place="margin">2 Sa. 8 14</note> Edom. Seaventhly, the King
of<note n="h" place="margin">2 Sam. 10. 6</note> Ammon, assisted with thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
three thousand Syrians, made
warre against Israel; but <hi>Ioab</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
them into their Citie. After
a while they issue out againe, and
<note n="i" place="margin">2 Sam. 10 16</note> 
               <hi>Hadadezer</hi> brought foorth the
Syrians beyond the river Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes;
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:12742:14"/>
which <hi>David</hi> hearing, assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
all Israel, and went to battell
and subdued the Syrians, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
his servants; and after that
time assisted the Ammonites no
more. The<note n="l" place="margin">2 Sam. 11. 1</note> next spring fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<hi>David</hi> sent out <hi>Ioab</hi> and all
Israel with him against the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monites.
And in the mean while
he lying at home in Ierusalem, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed
himselfe with fleshly lusts.
Now, so many great and sundry
battels, and some of them so farre
distant, with divers passages of
peace between them, must needs
require a long time and many
yeares: which being added to the
former thirtie seaven yeares and
six moneths, I may safely say that
<hi>David</hi> was then in his declining
age. And yet he was not now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
olde. For he lived in all
but seaventie<note n="m" place="margin">2 Sam. 5. 4</note> yeares, and it is
evident that this happened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:12742:15"/>
the birth of <hi>Salomon,</hi> who is
reckoned the<note n="n" place="margin">1 Chr. 3 5</note> fourth sonne that
<hi>Bathsheba</hi> bore to <hi>David.</hi> But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the holy Ghost in that place
use the order of nature, or some
other order I will not determine.
Moreover, in what yeare of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi>
raigne <hi>Salomon</hi> was borne, or
how olde he was when <hi>David</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and hee began to raigne, is not
revealed in holy Scripture: and
therefore upon this wee can
ground no certaintie. Some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture
vpon the premises, that
<hi>David</hi> was now forty six yeares
olde, some that hee was fortie
eight, others imagine that he was
above fifty: But what the holy
Ghost hath concealed, that I will
not take upon me curiously to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine;
and therefore I content my
selfe with this generalitie, that
<hi>David</hi> was now in his declining
age.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:12742:15"/>
O what a shamefull thing was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/>
this; that hee which had bridled
his affections in the flower and
flame of his youth, should thus
staine his honor in his riper years?
For though no age be priviledged
to sin, yet inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinencie in a decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
age is most intolerable. Euen a
young man, so soon as he is born
hath one foot in the grave, but a
decaying man is ready to put in
the other foote also. There was a
riddle propounded by the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban
Sphinx, to wit, what crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is that which in the morning
hath foure legs, at noone two legs,
and at night three legges. And it
was answered that it is a man;
who in the morning, that is, in his
infancie, may bee sayde to have
foure legs, because a childe cree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
upon all foure: at noon, that
is, in the prime &amp; strength of his
age, he goeth uprightly upon two
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:12742:16"/>
legs: but at night hee hath three
legs, because then hee borroweth
the helpe of his staffe. And after
a while he is bedridden, and then
hee hath no legges, but is ready to
drop into his grave. <hi>Ioseph</hi> of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimathia
was not very olde, and
yet hee made a toombe in his<note n="a" place="margin">Ioh. 19 41</note>
garden. A garden is a place of
pleasure, a toomb is a monument
of mortalitie: he made his toomb
in a garden, that in the middest of
pleasures he might think of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie.
For though walking one
way hee saw nothing but odori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous
flowers richly imbroidred
and enameled by nature, yet when
hee turned him selfe the other
way, the grave presented it selfe
vnto him. And surely it had been
fit for <hi>David,</hi> his sunne now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
to drawe towardes the
west, to have thought upon his
mortality &amp; not upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fleshly lusts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:12742:16"/>
When I reprove incontinencie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/>
in riper age, my meaning is not
to give libertie to such as are
young: God forbid. For if ever
the exhortation of the Apostle to
<note n="b" place="margin">Tit. 2. 6</note> 
               <hi>Titus</hi> were necessarie, then it is
most necessary in these dayes, <hi>To
exhort young men to be sober minded.</hi>
For commonly they are like to
the Prodigall child, who thought
himselfe wiser then his olde fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
he supposed that the olde
Gentleman knew not what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
unto gallant behaviour,
but if hee himselfe could once
finger his portion, hee would not
bee curbed nor kept in, but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the fashion, and live like a
Gentleman. And therefore hee
said to his father,<note n="c" place="margin">Luk. 15 12</note> 
               <hi>Father give me
that portion of goods that falleth to me.</hi>
Well (such was the indulgency
of the olde man) hee hath gotten
it, and now being from vnder the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:12742:17"/>
wing of his fathers authoritie, he
flourisheth and flanteth it out in
brave apparell, and keepeth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
with the best like a gallant,
till all is spent with riotous living.
If a cisterne let out water at many
cockes, and take it in at none,
though now it be full, it will soon
be empty: and even so it is with
this gallant, his purse was full, but
it is soone empty, and all is gone
with vaine delights and sinfull
pleasures. Oh that young men
would take heed by this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and remember their Creator
in the dayes of their youth, and
learne to be sober minded. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure
some will say, that we
must not bee such rigid censurers
of young men, their age requires
delights, and they may repent
when they are olde. Well then,
go to, thou young man, followe
thy pleasures, and walke in the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:12742:17"/>
waies of thy heart, and in the
light of thine eyes, crowne thy
selfe with roses, and let no delight
be wanting which thy heart de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires;
but know that for all these
things, God will bring thee vnto
iudgement. And therefore let the
young man repent while he hath
time: for what doth hee knowe
whether ever hee shall live till he
be olde? A Carpenter goeth to
the wood to cut downe an aged
oake: but before he doe that, hee
cuts downe many a little wand.
One walking in a garden pulls
peradventure a ripe rose, and yet
before hee doe so, hee breaketh
off many a tender bud. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let the young man serve God
even while hee is young; for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
who knoweth, if he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
the Lord, whether the God

               <note n="a" place="margin">Eccles. 10. 1</note> 
               <hi>dead flies corrupt the oyntment
of the Apothecarie, so doth a little
folly him that is in reputation for wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and honour. David</hi> till this
time had kept his honour vnstai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
his good name was like a
pleasant perfume poured out,
which filled all Israel with the
sweetness of the odour. Now he
commits a folly, and hee shall be
reproved therewithall till the end
of the world. Wherefore all you
which hitherto have kept your
vessels in honour, whether in sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
life or in holy matrimonie,
take heed that you doe not fall
as <hi>David</hi> fell: but as you have
made a blessed beginning, so in
the name of God proceed to keep
your selves undefiled members
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:12742:18"/>
of Iesus Christ. Many vertues
are commended, but one onely
bestowes crownes and garlands
upon all the rest; the image of
happy eternity, happy Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.
And therefore continue,
or rather as you growe in yeares
so growe in grace, and bring forth
more fruit in your age. So shall
your silver haires be truely hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
and your persons shall bee
reverenced in the hearts of all
men. For<note n="b" place="margin">Pro. 16 31</note>

proceed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> grace to grace,
even till you come with honour
to the grave. The sunne is alwaies
amiable, but never more then at
the setting: and therefore seeing
you have shined with vertue in
the fore-noone of your life, God
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:12742:19"/>
forbid you should bee clowded
or overcast in the after-noone:
wherefore shine foorth more and
more, that your setting may bee
with glory and immortalitie. All

and delectable, but none may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> The second circumstance is,
that it happened in the time of
the warres with the Ammonites.
This was a very great warre: for
as wee haue read in the former
chapter and the first verse, <hi>David
had sent Ioab thither and all Israel
with him, who destroyed the countrey
of the Ammonites and besieged their
Citie.</hi> And it seemeth the Citie
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:12742:19"/>
was very manfully defended, so
that the siege went hard on both
sides. For it is very probable by
the wordes of <hi>Vrias</hi> the Hittite,
that the Arke of the Covenant
was fetched into the hoast of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael:
which vsed not to bee done
but onely in time of extreame
danger. And was this a time for
<hi>David</hi> to have wandring and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
eyes? was this a time for
vaine delights &amp; sinfull dalliance?
was this a time to give the raines
to his affections, and to satisfie the
lusts of the flesh? No, no: but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at such a time let even lawful
pleasures be abandoned.<note n="a" place="margin">Ioel 2. 16</note> 
               <hi>Let
the bridegroome goe out of his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
and the bride out of her bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber.</hi>
For what is to bee done
in such a case wee may learne of
<note n="b" place="margin">Exod. 17</note> 
               <hi>Moses;</hi> who while <hi>Iosua</hi> fought
with <hi>Amalec</hi> stood upon the top
of an hill to holde up his hands,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:12742:20"/>
and <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Hur</hi> were with
him; <hi>Aaron</hi> the Priest of the Lord,
and <hi>Hur</hi> one of the Princes of
the tribe of <hi>Iudah</hi> grandfather to
<hi>Bezaleel,</hi> the cunning workman.
Now it came to pass that when
<hi>Moses</hi> held vp his hands Israel pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed,
but when his hands fell
downe <hi>Amalec</hi> prevailed: And
when his hands were heavie, <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>
and <hi>Hur</hi> rowled a stone and
hee sate thereon, and they stayed
vp his hands on the one side and
on the other, so his hands were
steddy till the going downe of
the sunne. And even so should
<hi>David</hi> have done, hee should have
holden up his hands for the hoast
of Israel: and in so doing both <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>
and <hi>Hur,</hi> that is, both Priest
and People should have assisted
and supported him. Yea this may
teach vs all our dutie in the like
case. When <hi>Iosua</hi> fights against
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:12742:20"/>
               <hi>Amalec,</hi> when the Arke of God
is in danger, when Iudah and
Israel, when our brethren that are
pillers in the Church of God are
up in armes, though we our selves
be safe at home, though wee bee
far from dint and danger, though
wee feare not the roaring of the
Cannon, nor the push of the Pike,
yet wee may not follow sinfull
pleasures with <hi>David,</hi> but holde
up our hands with <hi>Moses.</hi> Yea in
such a case it behooveth <hi>Moses,
Aaron,</hi> and <hi>Hur,</hi> Prince, Priest, and
People, to holde up their hands,
and to pray to the Lord: <hi>For</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Iam. 5. 16</note> 
               <hi>much availeth the prayer of a
righteous man if it be fervent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third circumstance is, that
<hi>David</hi> lay then at home in peace,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/>
plenty, and prosperity; yea, as it
is commonly holden, in idleness
and ease. But wherein consisted
this idleness? I finde three rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:12742:21"/>
rendred. First, because hee
lay at home in the time of the
warres: but wee must consider
that the life of a King is worth
ten thousand of ours, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not to bee endangered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
great necessitie. Secondly,
because hee lay upon his pallat in
the afternoone; but we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
that a King is troubled with
cares for the Common-wealth,
which make him wake when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men sleepe, and therefore
such rest and repose may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
be requisite for him. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
because he had leasure to walk
upon the top of his house, and to
view the Citie: but it were hard
to denie that honest recreation to
a King which is permitted to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
common person. How then?
was hee idle or no? Truely, these
three points do not of necessitie
convince him of sinfull idleness:
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:12742:21"/>
yet because all these three things
now concurred, and there follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
such fowle events, as common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
proceed from idlenesse; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
both ancient and late Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
comparing the antecedents
with the consequents, doe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
impute his adultery to sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
idlenesse: and this we may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
as a most probable opinion.
Then mark, I pray you, when <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
fell. Not when he was a poor
Shepheard following the Ewes,
not when hee fought the Lords
battels against the Philistines, not
when hee fled before the face of
<hi>Saul:</hi> but when he raigned peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
at home from <hi>Dan</hi> to <hi>Bershe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba,</hi>
when he had atchieved many
and great victories abroad, and
had almost conquered all his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
when he had inlarged his
Dominions &amp; was inriched with
abundance of gold and silver;
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:12742:22"/>
then and not before he gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to chambering and wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
And heere let us observe
the unthankfulness of <hi>David,</hi> who
when he should have beene pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
God, for so many and so great
blessings, neglected his dutie, and
dishonoured his Maker. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all you Courtiers which live
in wealth and ease, in pomp and
braverie: you that dip your foot
in oyle, and swimme in streames
of gold: you that inioy all plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
which Sea or land may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,
or the wit of man can possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
devise; you that keep the key
of natures closet, and have the
sunne alwaies shining upon your
Tabernacle, take heed, in the
name of God, take heed lest Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
tempt you. For you may see
by this example of <hi>David,</hi> that
whom adversitie cannot bend,
prosperity can breake. And thus
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:12742:22"/>
much of the time.</p>
            <p>To come to the fourth point:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/>
How was <hi>David</hi> thus inveigled
and intangled with the subtilty of
sinne? Truly by little and little.
Consider, therefore, I pray you,
how sinne steales upon a man by
degrees. First, hee was idle. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
in his idlenesse hee had a
wandring eye, which glancing
upon a woman as shee bathed her
selfe, delighted to behold that
beautifull obiect. Thirdly, hee
did not onely looke, but lust after
her. Fourthly, in his lust he made
a curious inquirie to know what
she was. Fiftly, when he knew, he
sent for her. Sixtly, when shee
came he tempted her: and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
he committed folly with her.
These are the steps which lead to
the den of death.</p>
            <p>The first steppe was idlenesse,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/>
and therfore let vs beware of idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:12742:23"/>
and resist the beginnings.
A burning torch when it begins
to languish, if it stand still is quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
quenched; but if it be shaken
it will recover, and receive new
inflammation: even so the torch
of Grace is extinguished by idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
but honest imployments do
kindle and increase it. A running
water will keepe sweet, when a
standing poole will putrefie: even
so laborious industry will keepe
the soule pure, but idlenesse fils it
with iniquity. Now though idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
be the mother of much mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe,
yet especially of fleshly
lusts.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Quaeritur Aegystus quare sit fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus
adulter.</l>
               <l>In promptu causa est, desidio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
erat.</l>
            </q>
            <p>That is, it is demanded how <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gystus</hi>
became an adulterer: &amp; the
cause is soone rendred; he was i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:12742:23"/>
And if the question be how
<hi>David</hi> became an adulterer, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
will give you the like an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere,
that it flowed from the
fountaine of idlenesse. Therefore
take heed of idlenesse, it was one
of the sinnes of<note n="a" place="margin">Ez. 16 49</note> Sodome.</p>
            <p>The second step to his fall, was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/>
a wandring eye, which rowling
up and down did glance vnawares
upon <hi>Bathsheba</hi> the bright, as shee
was bathing her selfe, and was so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly
rapt with the admiration
of her beautie: neither was hee
satisfied with a glance; but as it is
most likely hee fixed his eye and
gazed upon her again and againe.
Well, it is too plaine what <hi>David</hi>
did: Now let us consider what
he should have done, and what is
all our duties to doe in the like
case. As <hi>Ioachim</hi> the Priest char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the inhabitants of Bethulia
to keep the passages of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:12742:24"/>
for by them there was an
entrance into Iudea:<note place="margin">Iudeth c. 4. 6. 7</note> so I exhort
all men to looke to their hearing
and seeing (for those are the passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of the mountaines) lest by
them the divell, like <hi>Holofernes,</hi>
get entrance into the heart. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
seeing so little a sparkle
can kindle so great a flame, seeing
so much mischiefe may arise from
the glance of an ey, and such glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are hardly avoidable by the
wit of man; therefore let vs all
pray to God, that he wil be in our
eies and in our looking. Lord turn
thou away mine eyes that they
doe not behold vanity. Thirdly,
if thy eye glancing, thou feelest
thy selfe ravisht with admiration,
or surprized with affectuous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectation,
then go out of the place,
or remove thine eye to an other
obiect. Gaze not upon the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of a woman, lest thou be taken
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:12742:24"/>
by that which is precious in her.
If beeing removed from the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect,
thou canst not put her out of
thy cogitation; then strive to raise
up thy thoghts from the creature
to the Creator, and consider that
all the beautie of the creature is
from the Creator, and nothing els
but a sparke of that fire, a beame
of that Sunne, a drop of that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptiable
Ocean; and say with
thy selfe: If there be such beautie
in a creature, ô how incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible
is the beautie of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator?
ô my God, when shall I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
thy glorious face, in whose
presence is all fulnesse of ioy, and
at whose right hand are pleasures
for evermore? If still thou feele
the fire to kindle upon thee, then
consider the subtiltie of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
that lieth lurking even in the
fairest creatures, to kill and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
thee: and take unto thee the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:12742:25"/>
whole Armor of God; the Shield
of Faith, the Helmet of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the Sword of the Spirit,
which is the word of God. Draw
this sword, shake and brandish it
against thy carnall corruptions,
in this or the like manner: Thou
shalt not commit adultery; no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicatour
shall enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of heaven: whoremongers
and adulterers God will iudge:
and if thus thou use this fiery and
flaming sword, then by the grace
of God thou mayest behead the
temptation. Fiftly, if for all this
the flame increase, then fall upon
thy knees, pray unto thy God, i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate
Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> who, when the
windes began to blowe, and hee
began to sinke,<note place="margin">Mat. 14 30</note> cryed, <hi>Lord, save
mee;</hi> and Christ reached out his
hand and saved him: even so,
when thou feelest thy selfe begin
to sinke in a temptation, cry, Help
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:12742:25"/>
Master, I perish: And hee that
reached out his hand to helpe <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
wil reach out his hand to help
thee.</p>
            <p>The third steppe was concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/>
for his eyes collecting
the beames of her shining beauty,
became a burning glasse to set
both bodie and soule and all the
powers and faculties of nature in
combustion. So the image of the
obiect was transported from the
outward to the inward senses, and
namely, to the fancie, the fancie
commended it to the heart; so
now the eye lookes, the heart
lusts, and the more it lookes the
more it lusts: Thus concupis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
crept in at the window of
a wandring eye, and set the heart
on fire. This is that which was
expressed by <hi>Nathan</hi> in the para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of the rich man who had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
sheepe, and yet when a travai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:12742:26"/>
stranger came vnto him, hee
would not give him intertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with his owne sheepe, but
he tooke the poore mans one and
onely lambe. This poore man
was <hi>Vrias</hi> the Hittite, his one and
onely lambe was his young and
beautifull wife. The rich man
was <hi>David,</hi> his many sheepe his
many wiues, and the travailer was
Concupiscence; indeed a great
travailer which hath travailed far
and neare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thorough the wide
world. Goe to the East or West
Indies, to the Pole Artick or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tartick,
to what Coast or Climate
you will, you shall be sure every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
to finde the foot-steps of
Concupiscence. This travailer
doth visite both the Kings Court
and the Countrey Cottage, yea
and I can tell you hee is well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
in the Popes Palace. Let
a Monke betake him to his Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:12742:26"/>
concupiscence will go with
him: Let the Hermite flie to the
forsaken Wilderness, concupis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
will follow after him: Let
the Recluse bee mued or mured
up in a wall, yet concupiscence
will finde him out. Wherefore
concupiscence may iustly be tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
a travailer, an exceeding
great travailer. And because this
travailer came now to <hi>David</hi> as a
stranger, thereby it appeares that
hitherto hee had kept his vessell
in sanctification and honour. I
feare mee there are many with
whom concupiscence is not so
great a stranger. I pray God keep
us all from entertaining acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
with such a stranger. For
concupiscence is like a Serpent;
if once he get in his head, he will
wriggle-in his whole bodie. First
he comes in with flattering blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments:
but if once hee get an
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:12742:27"/>
entrance, then looke to thy selfe,
he will seek to be thy Master.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> The fouth step was a curious
inquisition. For concupiscence
being now entertained did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
perswade him to send and
enquire what woman that was, in
whom there appeared such a bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
beauty: And one said,<note n="a" place="margin">2 Sam. 11. 3</note> 
               <hi>Is

               <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam,
the wife of Vrias the Hittite?</hi>
To what end was this curious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry?
Paradventure some will
say, hee did it with an intention
to marry her also, if shee had bin
without an husband. It may bee
so; But when hee vnderstood
that she was anothers mans wife,
hee should have surceased, and
have laboured to put such idle
cogitations out of his minde, hee
should then have taken no further
notice of her, but have let the
memorie of her beautie have
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:12742:27"/>
passed away like a blaze of fire
which is suddenly extinguished,
like a flash of lightning which is
presently vanquished, or like
when one beholdeth his face in a
glasse, and remembreth the fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it no more.</p>
            <p>But <hi>David</hi> proceeded from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/>
to worse. For after an idle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition,
there followed the fift
step, that is, a vaine and an idle
message unto the woman, that she
should come unto him. Oh what
a folly was this? Can a man carry
coales in his bosome, and not be
scoarched? Can the fly play with
the candle, and her wings not be
singed? Thus he poures oyl into
the fire, and increaseth the flame.
My brother, if the like temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
befall thee, do not thou as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
did: but pray unto thy God,
read the Scriptures, resorte to

And what a madnesse is it, for a
little pleasure of sinne that lasteth
but a season, and bringeth nothing
but repentance, to endanger the
losse of those eternall ioyes which
never eye hath seen, nor ever eare
hath heard, nor ever entered into
the heart of man: And not so on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:12742:29"/>
but also to bee cast into hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire,
there to burne everlastingly
with the Divell and his Angels?
Besides all this, what a blemish
and scandall would this be to the
Church of God? How would it
grieve the godly, reioice the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
and cause the holy race of
God to bee blasphemed? O but
the matter shall bee carried in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,
saith the flesh. Alas, there
is nothing so secret (saith the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit)
which shall not be revealed;
if not in this world, yet in the
world to come, before men and
Angels. And in the meane time,
hee that formed the eye, shall not
hee see? Hee that planted the
eare, shall not he heare? His eyes
are ten thousand times brighter
then the sunne; all things are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
and naked in his sight; hee is
about thy bedde and about thy
path, &amp; spyeth out all thy wayes.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:12742:29"/>
While thus the flesh and the spirit
were contending together, in
comes the woman, and <hi>David</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
her was inflamed with
her beauty. So while hee looked,
lust kindled, and the flesh prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
against the spirit.</p>
            <p>And now hee is come even to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/>
the brinke of the pit. For behold
here followeth the sixt step, that
is, temptation. Hee that should
have beene the protector of her
chastitie, was not ashamed to
tempt her unto folly. Thus the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
spred from the eye to the
fancy, from the fancie to the
heart, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the heart to the tongue.
That tongue, which before was
his glory, is now become his
shame; and that tongue, which
had been a great and gracious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
to sound out the praise
of God, is now become a wicked
instrument to instill the poyson of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:12742:30"/>
the subtle Serpent.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23"/> And here somewhat would be
said concerning the woman. First,
the bathing of her selfe cannot
be reprooved: there were many
legall impurities which so requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
But the place was not so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,
nor the manner so wary as
became the modestie of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
shee should have conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that every windowe hath an
eye, and every Tower and Turret
might overlooke her. Secondly,
that, being sent for, shee came to
her Soveraigne, is not to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended.
She had no reason to
suspect or imagine any vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
from such a man. But when
shee saw his speeches tend to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honestie,
then shee should haue
fled away as from a Serpent, shee
should have endured a thousand
deathes rather then have suffred
her body to be polluted. But who
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:12742:30"/>
can tell what womanish cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
might bewitch her?<note place="margin">Martyr.</note> 
               <hi>Peter
Martyr</hi> is of opinion, that perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
she thought a bill of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce

               </note> and then shee
by this meanes might become a
Queen. So dangerous a thing is
it when great personages pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
unto sinne. Their words are
bewitching, their perswasions are
potent, they fill unsettled heads
with flattring hopes, which blind
the understanding, and make bold
to offend. Wherefore, all you to
whom the Lord hath given ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and riches, power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
see that you perswade
to that which is good; but do not
tempt to that which is evill. Or if

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/> But now mee thinkes I heare
the licentious Libertine reioyce,
and say, If <hi>David</hi> a man of such
sanctitie commited adulterie,
why may not I? What do I hear?
why may not I? O wicked and
profane wretch, if a man of san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitie
commit a sinne, wilt thou
neglect his sanctitie, and imitate
his sinne? Thou shouldest imitate
his sanctitie, and bewaile his sin.
But what a thing is this? Wilt
thou first observe in Gods Saints
their falls of infirmitie, and then
encourage thy selfe to sinne by
example of their frailtie; and
lastly, shrowd thy sinne under the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:12742:31"/>
vaile of their sanctitie? So did
not <hi>David.</hi> He sinned indeed: but
it was as Saint<note n="a" place="margin">in Ps. 50</note> 
               <hi>Austin</hi> truely
saith, <hi>Lapsucupiditatis, non patrocinio
sanctitatis;</hi> that is, He was drawne
away by his owne concupiscence
and inticed, but hee did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
himselfe to sinne by other
mens example. Hee did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to imitate their frailtie, and
then hide his wickednesse under
the vaile of their holiness. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if thou commit adulterie by
the example of <hi>David,</hi> thy adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie
is farre worse then was the
adultery of <hi>David.</hi> Hee sinned of
infirmity, thou sinnest upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption.
Hee was surprized on
a sudden, thou sinnest upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditation.
He was carried away
captive by a violent passion, but
thou pullest sinne unto thee, as it
were with cart-ropes. But tell
me, did <hi>David</hi> scape unpunished
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:12742:32"/>
for his sinne? Thou knowest hee
did not. But as he defiled another
mans daughter, so his owne<note n="b" place="margin">2 Sa. 13</note>
daughter was defiled; even his
daughter <hi>Thamar,</hi> and that by her
owne brother <hi>Ammon.</hi> As he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed

               <hi>Absalon,</hi>
upon the top of the house, in the

the sunne. Now if iudgement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne
at the sanctuarie of God,
where shall the wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
man appeare? If the Lord
deal so with the trees of Paradise,
what will he doe to the bramble
of the wildernesse? If hee thus
punished <hi>David,</hi> dost thou thinke
hee will spare thee? If hee dealt
thus with <hi>David,</hi> dost thou thinke
hee will dally with thee? No, no:
but rather, if hee corrected him
with rods, hee will scourge thee
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:12742:32"/>
with scorpio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. Wherfore as thou <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/>
castest one eye upon the sinne of
<hi>David,</hi> so cast thy other eye upon
the punishment of <hi>David:</hi> &amp; then
if there be any grace in thee, thou
wilt not imitate his sin, but trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
at his punishment.</p>
            <p>Now seeing these things were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/>
written for our learning; therfore
let there bee no adulterer, no nor
fornicatour amongst us, but let
men keepe themselves undefiled,
as it becommeth Saints. He that
commits fornication, he wrongs
his owne soule, his owne body,
his owne credit, and is a dishonor
and staine to his fathers house. He
that commits fornication, hee
wrongs the woman which hee
polluteth, and brings a perpetuall
disgrace upon her; and this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
redounds to her father, her
friends, and the whole familie.
He that commits fornication, he
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:12742:33"/>
wrongs his owne childe, and
brands it with a perpetuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach.
Finally, he that commits
fornication, he violateth the fiery
lawe of the most High, and the
royall commandement of his
God, and pulleth downe wrath
and vengeance upon his owne
head. For no<note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 6 9. 10</note> fornicator (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
hee repent) shall ever inherit
the kingdome of heaven. And if
fornication be so execrable, what
shall we say of adultery? When a
couple are married or betrothed,
they make a solemn<note n="b" place="margin">Mal. 2 14</note> promise or
vow one to another in the name of
the al-seeing God. Now the adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer
besides all his other offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces,
he transgresseth the covenant of
his God. Besides this, he wrongs
his owne wife with whom hee is
linked in wedlocks golden band;
his wife I say, whom hee should
love as his owne soule. O how
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:12742:33"/>
he wrongs her in that hee prefers
a strumpet before her! Againe,
the adulterer wrongeth the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
of the woman which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fileth;
who, if it come to his
knowledge, is thereby inraged;
his iealousie burnes like fire, and
he wil not spare in the day of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance.
And this undoubtedly is
a marvailous wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g. For first, he is
robd of the love of his wife, an
inestimable iewell. 2. His estate
by this meanes may be translated
to another mans childe: and is it
then any marvaile if States and
Common-wealths have been se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
in punishing of adultery? I
wil only touch this point briefly,
because the time passeth away.</p>
            <p>In the Leviticall Law, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="26"/>
and the adulteresse were
both put to death.<note place="margin">Le. 20. 10</note> I confesse, that
the Iudicials of <hi>Moses</hi> were moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon the Iewish Common-wealth,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:12742:34"/>
and doe not simply binde
Christians, yet there is a perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
equity to be observed, to wit,
that sinne be so punished that men
may feare to offend. This was
practised of the Gentiles even by
the light of nature; for the Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians
did punish adulterie with
loss of life, as witnesseth<note n="b" place="margin">Geogr. li. 16</note> 
               <hi>Strabo.</hi>
Among the heathen Romans, <hi>Lex
Iulia</hi> was renowned, and terrified
many. Others, though they made
it not Capitall, yet they layd hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie
punishment upon it, and
filled the faces of adulterers
with shame and infamie. Some
write, that the Egyptians did
vse to cut off the womans nose,
and beate the man with battes
almost to death.<note n="a" place="margin">Valerius Max.</note> 
               <hi>Zaleuchus</hi> king
of the <hi>Locrenses</hi> made a lawe
that adulterers should lose both
their eyes. In later ages the
Church of Rome hath beene too
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:12742:34"/>
much indulgent unto this sinne,
and thereby gotten mynes of sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
and gold. Yea the Pope hath
been so shamelesse as to take a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
of<note n="b" place="margin">See Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pencaeus de contin. l. 3. c 4</note> Courtizans; this was
<hi>Daemon meridianus,</hi> the Divell
raigning at noone day. This was
not onely a sinne in the State, but
the sinne of the State, because it
had approbation by publike au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie.
With vs, though this sin
too much abound, yet it is puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shable
by our lawes, and hath no
cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance from authority. And
therefore, though it be a sinne in
our State, it is not the sinne of our
State. Yet it were to bee wished
that those grave and iudicious Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
and Senators of the kingdom,
which heare mee this day, would
in their godly wisedome consider
whether it were not fit that the
corporall punishment of adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
should be augmented among
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:12742:35"/>
us that men may stand in awe and
sinne not.</p>
            <p>And when good lawes are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted,
let them not be like spiders
webs, where great flies breake
through, and little flies are entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled.
Let it not be said among us,
as it was sometime amongst the
Romans,<note n="c" place="margin">Iuven. sat. 2</note> 
               <hi>Vbi nunc lex Iulia!
Dormis!</hi> How great regard is to be
had of the execution of whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
lawes, we may see in <hi>Zaleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus:</hi>
who having made the lawe
before mentioned, That adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers
should lose both their eyes,
it came to passe that his owne son
committed adultery. What was
heere to be done? should hee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute
the law, and put out his
eyes? Alas, it was his owne &amp; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>only
sonne, and by this meanes
the people should have had a
blinde King. Should hee not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute
it? Who then would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:12742:35"/>
his lawes, when he himselfe
did first breake them? Therfore
he tooke a middle course. Because
the lawe required the putting out
of two eyes; therefore he put out
one of his sonnes eyes, for hee
had offended: and another of his
owne, that his people might see
how much he abhorred the sinne
of adultery, and withall how
much he respected the execution
of lawes.</p>
            <p>But howsoever man doe neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="28"/>
the execution of iustice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
adulterers, the God of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
will find them out. The chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Israel committed forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 8</note> and there fell in one day
foure and twenty thousand. <hi>Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben</hi>
the sonne of <hi>Iacob</hi> ascended
into his fathers bed, and thereby
hee lost three prerogatives belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
to the first borne.</p>
            <p>The first was the office of the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:12742:36"/>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Ex. 28. 1</note> Priesthood, which was given
to the sons of <hi>Aaron,</hi> which were

was the soveraignty, which was

was the double portion, which

all these, it was said to <hi>Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben,</hi>
thou wast unstable as water,
thou shalt not excell. I knowe
there is great difference between
incest and adultery; neither dare
I enter into Gods secret iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
yet thus much is certain,
that as incest, so likewise adultery
is a<note n="d" place="margin">Iob 31 12</note> fire that consumeth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction;
and will root out all a
mans increase. And therefore if
a man would have a blessed seed,
let him keepe his body vndefiled.
<hi>Ioseph</hi> refused to staine his vessell,<note place="margin">Gen. 49. 4</note>
and the Lord so blessed him in his
mariage, that his two sons<note n="e" place="margin">Gen. 48. 5</note> 
               <hi>Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im</hi>
and <hi>Manasses</hi> were reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:12742:36"/>
the tribes of Israel: yea <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>
did blesse in them, and say,
God make thee as <hi>Ephraim</hi> and as
<hi>Manasses.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ver. 20</note> On the contrary, if
men shall defile another mans
bed, it shall be the iust iudgement
of God, if they finde a crosse in
their owne mariage bed, and if
their owne wives and daughters
be defiled. Yea, if they shall bee
hardned in this filthiness, let them
take heed lest this fire so burne to
destruction, that it roote out all
their increase, and cause their
houses to decay, and their lands
to be translated to another name.</p>
            <p>And yet I would exhort all
men, that they would refrain this
sinne, not so much for feare of
punishment, as for conscience
sake. Not your soules onely, but
your bodies also were created ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Gods image, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
defile them not. Not your
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:12742:37"/>
soules onely, but your bodies al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
are bought with a price, even
with the precious blood of Iesus
Christ, and therefore defile them
not. Not your soules onely, but
your bodies also are temples
of the holy Ghost; and therefore
defile them not: but so preserve
these vessels of grace in this
world, that they may bee vessels
of glory in the world to come.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen of late I entred
upon the explication
of this Text in a
Princely presence, I
proposed 3 things in
<hi>David</hi> to be considered; his sinne,
his repentance, and his absoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
The sinne of <hi>David,</hi> reproved
by <hi>Nathan,</hi> and here confessed and
lamented by himselfe, was first of
all, that great and grievous sinne
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:12742:38"/>
of adultery; and secondly those
other enormous sinnes wherwith
hee entangled himselfe, while he
went about to hide and conceale
his adultery.</p>
            <p>To shew the haynousnesse of
his adultery, I unfoulded foure
points. The first was the qualitie
of his person; where it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that <hi>David</hi> was the most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
and remarkeable man that
was then living upon the face of
the earth. The second, was the
condition of the woman; and it
was declared that she was a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
woman, the wife of one <hi>Vri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi>
who was by nation an Hittite,
by religion a Proselyte, by profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
a Souldier, a Captain, a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
Captaine, and reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Worthies of <hi>David.</hi>
The 3 point was the time, descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
by three circumstances. For
this iniquity was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted, first in
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:12742:38"/>
his declining age, when it had bin
fitter for him to have beene thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of his grave, then of fleshly
lusts. Secondly, in the time of
the warres with the Ammonites,
when hee should have beene hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
up his hands for the Hoast of
Israel. Thirdly, when he enioyed
peace at home, with plenty and
prosperity; for which hee should
have praised God with a thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
minde. The fourth point, was
the manner how hee was thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snared;
which was by seven steps
or degrees. For, first, he was idle.
Secondly, in his idlenesse he had
a wandring eye. Thirdly, hee did
not onely looke but lust after her.
Fourthly, hee was curious in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
who she was. Fiftly, hee
was vaine in sending for her. Sixt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
hee was lewd in tempting her.
And lastly, he was wicked in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting
folly. Hitherto of his sin
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:12742:39"/>
of adultery. Now I proceed to
the sinnes he commited while he
went about to hide and conceale
his adultery.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> This concealing of sinne is a
vice so incident to the nature of
man, that wee may seeme not to
have learned it, but even to have
suckt it with our mothers milke.
A noble example hereof, we have
in the seaventeenth chapter of the
booke of <hi>Iosua:</hi> When <hi>Achan</hi> had
committed sacrilege, by stealing
the golde, and the silver, and the
goodly Babylonish garment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the wrath of the Lord was
kindled, and Israel fled before
their enemies. Then all Israel was
brought forth tribe by tribe, and
the tribe of <hi>Iudah</hi> was taken.
Now though <hi>Achan</hi> were of the
tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> yet hee would not
confess his sinne, but still concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
it. Secondly, the tribe of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:12742:39"/>
was brought forth familie by
familie, and the family of the <hi>Zar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hites</hi>
was taken: but though <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan</hi>
were of the family of the
<hi>Zarhites,</hi> yet hee would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
this sinne, but still concealed
it. Thirdly, the family of the <hi>Zar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hites</hi>
was brought forth house by
house, and the house of <hi>Zabdi</hi> was
taken: and though <hi>Achan</hi> were
of the house of <hi>Zabdi,</hi> yet hee
would not confess his sinne, but
still concealed it. Fourthly, the
house of <hi>Zabdi</hi> was brought forth
man by man, and <hi>Achan</hi> was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken;
who, then, and not before
confessed it, when hee could no
longer conceale it. And even so
did <hi>David:</hi> He bent all his wits &amp;
studie to hide and cloak his adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery:
neither doe we finde that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
hee did confesse it to God or
man, before such time as the God
of heaven had so revealed it by
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:12742:40"/>
the Prophet <hi>Nathan;</hi> that now it
could bee no longer concealed.
Nay, the concealing of <hi>David</hi>
was farre worse then the concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of <hi>Achan.</hi> For <hi>Achan</hi> concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
his sacriledge onely by secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
and silence; but <hi>David</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
his adultery by most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
practices.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Now that we may plainely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the whole proiect of his
proceedings, my present dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
shall consist of two bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
In the former, by the grace
of Christ, I will declare how hee
did hide and conceale it from
man. In the later, how he went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
(so much as in him lay) to
hide and conceale it, even from
the all-seeing eye of God. In the
former branch two things are to
be considered: the causes which
moued him, and the meanes (that
is, the politick practices) which
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:12742:40"/>
hee used to accomplish the same.
Of which in order, by Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
assistance, and your royall
patience.</p>
            <p>The causes which moved <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
to hide and cloake his adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
may probably bee reduced
to two heads, that is, a double de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to shun and avoid two rocks;
the shame of the world, and the
danger of the law. The first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
from a care to preserve
their credit, lest if the matter
were knowne; they should both
be utterly ashamed for ever. And
here wee are to distinguish a<note n="a" place="margin">Eclus. 4 21</note>
double shame, an honourable
shame, and a dishonourable. The
honourable shame is that which
bringeth glory and grace, either
by preve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting, or by repenting: by
preventing a sinne that it bee not
committed, or by repenting for
a sinne when it is committed. The
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:12742:41"/>
preventing shame is composed of
two passions, feare and love; feare
of infamy, and love of honesty.
An example of this wee have in
<hi>Ioseph,</hi> when hee was tempted of
his Mistris. And here consider
with me how great provocations
he had to yeeld unto her. First, he
was a faire and beautifull young
man, in the prime and flower of
his age. Secondly, he was a poor
servant, yea and a stranger, farre
from his countrey, his kinred, &amp;
his fathers house; and therefore
had need of friends. Now if he
had yeelded unto her, hee should
not have wanted gold, nor silver,
nor rich apparell, nor any honour
or preferment that she could pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
procure unto him. But in
reiecting her, hee was sure to bee
turned out a doors, and to endure
all disgrace that the wit of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
sharpned with malice could
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:12742:41"/>
possibly devise. And yet this gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
yong man would not yeeld
to her allurements. Hee conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
first, the goodnesse of God,
and what a great wickednesse it
were to sin against him. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly,
he considered how beneficiall his
Master had beene unto him, and
what a shame it were to requite
him evill for good. 3. He consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
how precious a thing is is for
a man to keepe his body unstai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and what a dishonor it were
to defile his vessell. Vpon these
considerations, he answered the
woman,<note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 39 9</note> 
               <hi>How can I doe this great
wickednesse, and so sinne against God?</hi>
How can I? As though he should
say, With what face can I doe it?
It is a most shamefull thing, and
therefore I cannot doe it. Here
was feare and love; a gracious
feare of infamy, and a zealous
love of honesty. This was an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:12742:42"/>
shame, so to be ashamed
of sinne even because it is sinne, as
to shun and avoid it. An exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the other wee have in the
prodigall childe: who though he
had not a preventing shame (for
he fell into many enormities) yet
yet he had a repenting shame; for
when he came to himself, he loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
into his former actions, and
was ashamed of that he had done.
This also was an honorable shame,
because it wrought repentance in
him: and that brought vnto him
glory and grace.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> The dishonourable shame is
that which bringeth sin: whereof
are sundry sorts. But that which
serves for our present purpose, is;
when a man knowing how shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
a thing sinne is, hath neither
care to prevent it, nor grace to
repent it, but bends all his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
onely to hide and cover it
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:12742:42"/>
from the eyes of the world: and
such a shame was in <hi>David</hi> and
<hi>Bathsheba.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To begin with the woman. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
a while she perceives that she
had conceived with child, and
now shee feares lest the world
would take knowledge of her
lewd demeanor, because her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
had bin so long from home.
Now therefore (though secretly)
she begins to weepe, to mourne,
and to make lamentation. Here is
a glasse for all women to looke in;
even <hi>Bathsheba</hi> the beautifull. She
that of late gave her co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to lasci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vious
dalliance; now shee se'eth
her owne folly, now shee is cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
with shame as with a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Those radiant and spark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
eyes which so darted love in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the eyes of <hi>David,</hi> are now all
bebleared and beblubbered with
weeping; the teares run downe
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:12742:43"/>
her blushing cheekes, she wrings
her hands, shee rents her goulden
haire, and with all possible speed
she sends unto <hi>David,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Sa. 11. 5</note> saying, <hi>I am
with child:</hi> as though shee should
say; ô wretch that I am, now my
sin can be concealed no longer;
the matter is plaine, my very bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
will shortly bewray it, I carrie
my accusation about me; on the
one side, I feare the shame of the
world; on the other, the danger
of the Lawe: but ô, how shall I
looke my poore Husband in the
face? You, you were the cause of
all this, and therefore to you I
make my moane: alas, alas! what
shall I doe? So shee that of late
had no regard of conscience, is
now tormented with an accusing
conscience; and she that before
was not ashamed to sinne, now she
is ashamed lest her sinne should
be knowne. But what sayd <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:12742:43"/>
to all this? for now he is put
to his shifts.</p>
            <p>Truly hee sheweth himselfe a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
notable spectacle of humane frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
for he had a greater care of his
credit then of his conscience; he
was more afraid of the shame of
the world, then he was of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure
of Almighty God; and
therefore he did palliate his sinne
to avoid the shame, but he did not
repent to avoid the displeasure.
And so much of the first motive.</p>
            <p>His second motive was, the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/>
of his darling: for by the Law
of God the adulteresse was to be
put to<note n="a" place="margin">3. Le. 20. 10</note> death; and therefore lest
shee whom hee loved so tenderly
should lose her life, and that by
his meanes, hee bends all the
strength of his wits to conceale
the matter. Hitherto of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives:
now I come to the meanes,
that is, his politike practices.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:12742:44"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> His first policy was to cloake
the matter by a false imputation:
for which purpose <hi>Vrias,</hi> the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
was to bee called home
from the campe; to the end, that
he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>versing with his wife, might
be supposed and reputed the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the childe. Wherein <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
did not only sin against God,
and his owne soule; but moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
hee intended three notorious
iniuries: the first against the poor
babe, the childe begotten of his
owne body, which by this means
he would have disclaimed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced,
even before it was born:
the second against <hi>Vrias</hi> to whom
he would have obtruded a child
by fraud &amp; imposture: the third,
against the heirs of <hi>Vrias,</hi> which
by this plot might have been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seised
and defrauded of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> Here was wisedome, I confesse:
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:12742:44"/>
but it was the wisdom of the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
there wanted the simplicity
of the Dove, Such was the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who said;<note n="b" place="margin">Ex. 1. 10</note> 
               <hi>Com,
let us work wisely,</hi> when hee inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to oppresse the children of
God. Such was the wisdome of
<note n="c" place="margin">1. Reg. 12 28.</note> 
               <hi>Ieroboam;</hi> who, to establish his
Kingdome, erected a standard to
Idolatry, by setting up two goul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Calves in Dan and Bethel.
This was wisdome, but not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
unto godliness. Wisedome
did I say, or rather folly? for, how
can that be called wisdom, when
men are wise to doo evill; but to
do good, they have no understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding?
And I dare be bold to say,
that the wisdom of <hi>Achitophel,</hi> the
wisdom of <hi>Matchiavel,</hi> and all wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
wisdom, howsoever it seeme
angelicall, howsoever it shine and
glister in the eyes of the world,
yet in true judgement it is nothing
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:12742:45"/>
else but meer folly:<note n="*" place="margin">Psa. 111 10</note> for, <hi>the fear
of the Lord is the beginning of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;</hi>
and therefore where there
is not the fear of God, there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
possibly bee any true wisdom.
<hi>David</hi> himselfe could somtimes

               <hi>I understand more then the
ancients, because I keepe thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts.</hi>
Wherfore if a man would
be truely wise, Let him fear God
and walke in his precepts. This is
wisdome according to godliness,
which will make a man wise to
salvation. And as this is the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of every private man, so
herein likewise consisteth the true
wisedome of Kings and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
of States and Common-wealths.
For<note n="b" place="margin">Deut. 4 5. 6</note> as <hi>Moses</hi> said to

in the sight of the nations,
which shall heare all these statutes, and

            <p>But to proceed in the story.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/>
The messenger is gone, <hi>Vrias</hi> is
sent for, he is come to the Court,
&amp; brought to the King; who <hi>asketh</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">2 Sam. 11. 7</note> 
               <hi>him how Ioab did, and how the

and after kinde communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

<hi>Goe home to thy house and

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:12742:46"/>
after him a favour from the King,
a messe of meate (no doubt dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and delicate) that hee and his
wife might make merry together.
But for all this courtly and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
invitation, <hi>Vrias</hi> went not
home to his wife, but slept at the
gate of the Kings palace.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> Which <hi>David</hi> understanding,

               <hi>(d) Camst thou
not from thy iourney? why then didst
thou not goe downe unto thy house?</hi>
Thus <hi>David</hi> pretended great love
and friendship unto <hi>Vrias,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
in truth hee intended onely to
make him a cloak for their iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
And is not this the fashion of
the world at this day? Many will
pretend great loue and friendship
unto a man, when if the truth
were known, it is onely to serve
their owne turnes, and in relation
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:12742:46"/>
to their owne private endes and
purposes.</p>
            <p>Hitherto wee have seen <hi>Davids</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/>
courteous invitation and friendly
expostulation: now let us hearken
unto the answere of <hi>Vrias.</hi> He said
unto <hi>David: The Arke, and Iudah
and Israel abideinaents,</hi>
               <note n="2" place="margin">Sa. 11. 11</note> 
               <hi>and my Lord
Ioab and his servants are incamped in
the open fields; shall I then goe home
to my house to eat and to drink, and to
lie with my wife? As thou livest, and
as thy soule liveth, I will not doe it.</hi>
First, let us co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider what is meant
by this, that the Arke aboade in
tents. And it seemeth to import
(as many both ancient and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne
writers doe take it) that the
Arke of the Covenant was now
fetched into the Hoast of Israel,
which<note n="a" place="margin">1 Sam. 4</note> used to be done in time
of danger, and that for foure rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
1. To incourage the soldiers:
because the Arke (wherein was
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:12742:47"/>
the<note n="b" place="margin">Heb. 9. 4</note> pot of Manna, the rod of
<hi>Aaron,</hi> and the tables of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant)
was a visible token of
Gods presence. Secondly, to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
that they trusted not in their
swords, but in the Lord, whose
strength was figured and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
in the Arke, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was called<note n="c" place="margin">Psa. 132 8</note> 
               <hi>the Arke of his
strength.</hi> Thirdly, to terrifie their
enemies: and therefore when the
Arke removed, these words were
vsed, <hi>Let God</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">Num. 10 35</note> 
               <hi>arise, and let his
enemies be scattered, let them also that
hate him flie before him.</hi> Fourthly,
that they might aske counsell of
the Lord in case of necessitie.
Thus the Iewes in their dangers
and extreamities had recourse to
the Arke. Now wee Christians
have not (as they had) the golden
Cherubins, the Mercy Seat, and
the Arke of the Covenant over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid
with golde: but our Arke is
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:12742:47"/>
Christ and his true Religion. And
happy shall we be both in Peace
and in Warre, if this Arke be still
among us. Our Land indeed is a
goodly Land, our gardens like
Eden, our rivers like Iordan: yea,
our Land is blessed, for the sweet
increase of the sunne, and for the
sweet increase of the moone, and
for the treasures hid in the sand;
yea, the whole Iland is walled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
with the Ocean. Yet, our
chiefe comfort consisteth in this,
that this true Arke of God is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us, and that our defence
is the Lord <hi>Iehavah.</hi> Lord let this
Arke still abide in our tents, that
our enemies may bee scattered,
and that we may alwaies reioyce
in thee the God of our salvation.
This point thus touched and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
by the way, let us now
ponder the wordes of <hi>Vrias:</hi> for
they are very memorable, and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:12742:48"/>
deserve to be written in letters of
gold.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> They containe two reasons.
The former is drawne from the
state of the Campe: and it is
threefold. First, the Arke of God
is in perill, and shall I goe follow
my private pleasures? Here was
a notable touch of religion and
devotion. Secondly, Iudah and
Israel are in their tents: and shall
I be such a tenderling as to hide
my head in an house of timber &amp;
stone? Here was a compassionate
care of the Campe: though his
body were absent, his heart was
with them Thirdly, my Lord <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ab</hi>
and his servants are encamped
in the open fields, <hi>Sub dio, sub Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
frigido:</hi> and shall I be chambred
up like a carpet Knight, or a
white-livered souldier? Heere
was a dutifull respect and confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
to his Governours. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:12742:48"/>
reason is drawen from the
consideration of his owne estate
and condition. Shall I go home?
I that am a professed souldier? I
that am a Captaine and Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of others? Nay, rather, my
house shall bee the vault of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
the ground shall be my bed,
a stone shall bee my pillow, the
sable curtaines of darknesse shall
be drawne about mee, and my
canopie shall bee the azure cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
of heaven, whether envelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
with clowds, or bespangled
with starres. But why should I
go home unto my house? To eat
and to drinke? Alas, this is not a
time for feasting; but rather, for
fasting and prayer. Or shall I goe
solace my selfe with my wife?
No, no: at such a time as this,
let even lawfull pleasures be aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned,
let the bridegrome goe
out of his chamber, and the bride
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:12742:49"/>
out of her bride-cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber. A noble
resolution for a souldier, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
one of the Worthies of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.</hi>
Is this a Hittite? or rather a
true Israelite, in whome is no
guile? O happy were a King
which had an army consisting of
such soldiers.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> This might have touched <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
to the quick, to see a souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
have more care of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
good then himselfe. But
here we may note how adulterie
taketh away the heart of a man:
it maketh him so dull, that hee
doth not reioyce at the zeale of
<hi>Vrias,</hi> but is sorry for it, because
it crossed his owne wicked de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes.
Yet <hi>Vrias</hi> still continued
constant, so that neither the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinesse
of his iourney, nor the
loue of his young and beautifull
wife, nor the Kings courteous
exhortation, nor his cunning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:12742:49"/>
nor his friendly expostu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
could prevaile with him,
or perswade him to go home un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his wife. Wherefore <hi>David</hi>
was hitherto disappointed of his
purpose.</p>
            <p>Yet beholde, another traine to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/>
bring him to his lure, though a
very bad and a base one. For the
next day hee invited him to eate
and drinke before him, and that
of sette purpose to make him
drunk. O mercifull God! what
will not sinfull man doe to avoide
the shame of the world? There
is no question, but <hi>David</hi> both
hated drunkennesse in his heart,
and punished it in others: and yet
to hide his owne shame, he is not
ashamed to make a man drunke.
There was a good lawe enacted
by King<note n="a" place="margin">Est. 1. 8</note> 
               <hi>Ahasuerus,</hi> that thogh
they might drink the royall wine

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:12742:50"/>
urge or compell. But <hi>David</hi> as it
seemeth did urge and compell <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias:</hi>
for the<note n="b" place="margin">2 Sam. 11. 13</note> text saith, that <hi>hee
made him drunke.</hi> And are there
not many at this day also, which
will urge and compell a man to
drinke till he be drunke? Some,
because they use to bee drunke
themselves, wish all other men to
be branded with the like infamy.
Others, which are strong to beare
drinke themselves, are so ungra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
that they reioyce to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the weaknesse of another, and
to triumph in his fall. Others doe
it of policie: when they cannot
bring a man to their owne bent
while hee is sober, they hope to
prevaile with him when hee is
drunk. And so did <hi>David.</hi> Now,
who, I beseech you would ever
have suspected such a thing by
<hi>David?</hi> Here I note, that a man
is soonest inveigled when he sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecteth
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:12742:50"/>
least harme, and never
sooner then under the colour of
friendship. Wherefore take heed
of thy foes: and as the world goes
now adayes, thou hadst neede to
take heed of thy friends also. For,
howsoever men pretend kinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
yet if they urge thee to drink,
looke to thy selfe, they are not
friends but foes; not kinde, but
cruell.</p>
            <p>And here, O that mine eyes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/>
were a fountaine of teares, that I
might lament the sinnes of this
Land; and namely, that beastly
sinne of drunkennes, which threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teneth
iudgement from heauen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
us; it is so spred from one
part of the Land unto another,
and like a deluge hath overflowed
all estates and degrees. O, what is
it like, or wherto shall I compare
it? It is like to a certaine <hi>Animal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum,</hi>
which some reckon among
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:12742:51"/>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Peucr. in Gen.</note> serpents or creeping creatures,
others resemble to a<note n="b" place="margin">Fitzh. rel. &amp; pol.</note> spider,
the name of it is <hi>Tarantula,</hi> so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
of <hi>Tarentum,</hi> a Citie of Apu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,
the effects whereof are in
strange variety. For some, being
bitten by the <hi>Tarantula,</hi> fall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
a-weeping; others breake
out suddenly into a loud laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Some when they are stung
by it, become lazie and sluggish;
others are all in motion, leaping
and dancing. Some, being woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by it, are made dumpish and
silent; others never cease prating
and babbling. And is not this the
plaine picture of drunkennes? It is
a lamentable case to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider how
many in this kingdome are daily
bitten by this <hi>Tarantula.</hi> And is
there no charme for the stinging
of this serpent?<note n="c" place="margin">Alex. ab Alex. gen. die l. 2. c. 17</note> 
               <hi>Alexander ab

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:12742:51"/>
that he himselfe sawe the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

the sweet timbrell of the Gospel,
they will not hearken unto the
Charmer, charme hee never so

but that they be charmed by the
severity of wholsome lawes. And
yet I cannot say, that there is any
defect of lawes, but rather a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in the execution. Many good
and godly lawes haue been made
in this kingdome against drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness,
and yet this sinne every
where aboundeth. O that this
high and honourable Court of
Parliament now to be assembled,
could yet in their godly wisdom
devise some further course for the
utter extinguishing of this <hi>Taran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tula.</hi>
Surely, it would redownd
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:12742:52"/>
much to the glory of God, to the

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> But to returne to <hi>Vrias:</hi> hee
dranke the royall wine, and was
made drunk, though not as our
<hi>Tarentati,</hi> which lie tumbling
in the streets, blaspheming God
and all good men: but drunk in
some degree; yet not so as to bee
deprived of his senses: he still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members
the danger of the Hoast
of Israel, and will not goe home
unto his wife. Wherefore they
could not impute the childe to
him, nor make a cloake for their
iniquitie: they have no colour to
cast that colour. So <hi>David</hi> was
cleane disappointed of his first
policie.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> His second policie, was to kill
<hi>Vrias,</hi> and to marry his wife; that
so, the childe might seeme to bee
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:12742:52"/>
gotten in marriage. What? to kill
him? had he not received wrong
enough already, that his wife was
defiled, but (alas poore man) must
hee lose his life also? It is as I tell
you, the matter is determined,
<hi>Vrias</hi> must die to save their credit,
there is no remedie. And here let
us consider what the best man is,
if God withdrawe his grace and
leave him to himselfe. Hee is like
to an iron ball, which, a man stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
upon the top of an hill, lets
goe out of his hand, and beholde
it runneth downe headlong, and
the further the faster till it come
in <hi>Profundum,</hi> even to the bottom
of the valley. Even so, if God let
us goe out of his hands, and leave
us to our selves, we run headlong
from sinne to sinne, even till wee
come in <hi>Profundu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> that is, into the
depth of all iniquitie. As heere
wee see in <hi>David,</hi> who to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:12742:53"/>
sinnes, addeth the horrible
sinne of murther; by killing <hi>Vrias,</hi>
who now was the onely man did
stand in their way. And hath not
this alwayes beene a practice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Politicians? If a man stand
in their way and hinder their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
or pleasure, or preferment, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they will lay a snare for him,
as the Nobles of <hi>Darius,</hi> for<note n="a" place="margin">Dan. 6</note> 
               <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi>
to cast him into the Lions
den: or if they cannot so entrap
him, they will have one device or
other to cut him off, as <hi>David</hi> did
<hi>Vrias:</hi> and rather then faile, they
will giue him a figge, and so make
him away. That these things
should be done, among Matchia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilians,
I would not marvaile: but
that holy <hi>David</hi> should doe it to
holy <hi>Vrias,</hi> this is a matter that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
to be lamented with many
teares.</p>
            <p>But how shall it be done? <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:12742:53"/>
is now growne a Politician,
hee will take him away so cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly,
that there shall not appear
so much as the least suspicion of
murther. And how so? Forsooth
hee will write to <hi>Iaob,</hi> the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
of the Campe, to place <hi>Vrias</hi>
in the forefront of the hottest
battell, and suddenly to retire
from him. O what a dishonor was
this, that Israel should flee before
their enemies? What an encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
was this to the vncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised?
and what a discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
to the people of God?
Yet at this time <hi>David</hi> will have
it so, to the end that <hi>Vrias</hi> beeing
left in the danger, might be smit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
and die by the sword of the
children of Ammon. Here was
notorious treachery: and poore
<hi>Vrias,</hi> like <hi>Bellerophon</hi> in the fable,
did carry the letters of his owne
death. This was cunning indeed:
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:12742:54"/>
but have patience a while; and
you shall see, that there is a God
which seeth all things, and will
not suffer sinne unpunished.</p>
            <p>What? would <hi>Ioab</hi> yeeld to
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> such an act? yes, hee did never
stick at it: so potent are the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of Princes. If <hi>Saul</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
to kill the holy Priests of
the Lord,<note n="b" place="margin">1 Sam. 22. 18</note> 
               <hi>Doeg</hi> will be his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
to do it. If <hi>Iezabel</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
to suborne false witnesses,
and to condemne the innocent,
the<note n="c" place="margin">1 Reg. 21 11</note> Nobles and Elders of Iez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael
will be her instruments to put
it in practice. O happy therefore
and thrice happy we, whose King
delighteth in the lawe of the
Lord, and meditateth therein day
and night. Pray we that the God
of <hi>Iacob</hi> will for ever so direct
him, that all his commandements
may alwaies be correspondent to
the commandements of the most
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:12742:54"/>
High. For there is no question,
but if Princes should command
even that which is simply evill, a
great number would be ready to
be bad instruments, to perform it.</p>
            <p>And heere let us marke what <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/>
manner of men they are, which
use to bee chosen instruments of
iniquity. First, those that hate a
man for his religion, and such an
one was <hi>Doeg</hi> the Edomite against
the Priests of the Lord. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
those that hunt after the favor
of great ones, and such were the
Nobles and Elders of Iezrael, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
to curry favour with <hi>Ieza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel.</hi>
Thirdly, those that are guilty
of some notorious crime, &amp; such
an one was <hi>Ioab,</hi> who long before
this was obnoxious to the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of death, for killing of <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">2 Sam. 3. 27</note>.
So now his life stood at
the Kings pleasure; and therefore
<hi>David</hi> knew hee had him at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:12742:55"/>
Wherefore let all men la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to carry themselves in inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie,
with a good conscience in
the feare of God.<note n="b" place="margin">Iob 11 14</note> 
               <hi>If iniquity be
in thy hand, put it farre from thee,
and let no wickednesse dwell in thy ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle:
then shalt thou lift up thy face

and shalt not feare:</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">pro. 10. 9</note> 
               <hi>for hee
that walketh uprightly, walketh sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi>
Such a man may bee bolde as
a Lion, and refuse to be made an
evill instrument. But here you see
how <hi>Davids</hi> wicked invention, &amp;
<hi>Ioabs</hi> cruell execution brought
good <hi>Vrias</hi> to his grave, in a bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
coffin.</p>
            <p>Neither <hi>Vrias</hi> alone was taken
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23"/> away by this treachery; but the
<note n="d" place="margin">2 Sam. 11. 17</note> Text saith plainly, that <hi>There
fell some of the people of the servants
of David;</hi> such of them, no doubt,
as were most couragious and vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant.
<hi>Ioabs</hi> commission extended
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:12742:55"/>
no further then to the<note n="e" place="margin">2 Sam. 11. 15</note> smiting &amp;
killing of <hi>Vrias,</hi> but it seemeth he
perceived that this could hardly
be done without the loss of moe.
Neither did hee write to <hi>David</hi>
concerning this point: but under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
that it was the Kings
pleasure that <hi>Vrias</hi> should die, he
was resolute to perform it, thogh
the exployt should cost him an
hundred mens lives. Here it may
seeme by <hi>Ioab,</hi> that Captaines are
sometimes too prodigall of the
lives of their souldiers. We read
that <hi>Abner</hi> sayde to <hi>Ioab,</hi>
               <note n="2" place="margin">Sam. 2 14</note> 
               <hi>Let the
young men arise and play before us.</hi>
So hee accounted fighting but a
play and a sport. Now, though
Captaines should be courageous
in a good cause, yet they must
love and tender the lives of their
souldiers.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/> If any man say, that it was not
<hi>David</hi> and <hi>Ioab</hi> which kild <hi>Vrias,</hi>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:12742:56"/>
but the sword of the children of
Ammon: Let him consider the
frame of a clock, and he shall see
how one wheele mooves another
wheele, and that another wheele,
and that the hammer, and so the
stroake is stricken: but the cause
of all this motion is a certaine se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
weight or poyse, which han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
in a corner, and is not seene.
As for example, in the story of
<hi>Naboth, Naboth</hi> was condemned
to death, there the stroake was
stricken: the hammer that gave
the stroake, was the iudge which
gave the sentence: the wheeles
that moved this hammer, were
the false witnesses: the wheeles
that moved these wheeles, were
the Nobles and Elders of Iezrael:
but the secret waights that set
all these wheeles a going, were
<hi>Achab</hi> and <hi>Iezabel.</hi> So <hi>Achab</hi> and
<hi>Iezabel</hi> were the principall agents
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:12742:56"/>
which mooved the men of Iez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
and they the false witnesses,
and they the Iudge: and thus
poore <hi>Naboth</hi> was put to death.
So, in this present story, <hi>Vrias</hi>
was slaine; there the stroake was
stricken: the hammer that gave
the stroake, was the sword of the
children of Ammon: the wheels
that mooved this hammer, were
the souldiers, which first made an
hot assault, and then suddenly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyring,
left <hi>Vrias</hi> to the sword of
the enemies. The great wheele
which moved these lesser wheels,
was <hi>Ioab,</hi> who so ordered the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell.
And the secret waight that
mooved this wheele, was <hi>David;</hi>
the first moover and cause of all
the motion.</p>
            <p>O, <hi>David, David!</hi> What hast <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/>
thou done? Knowest thou not
that innocent blood hath a cry
yea and a loud and a shrill cry?
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:12742:57"/>
and what doth it cry but venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
vengeance? Let all men
take heed of this crying sinne: if
it bee done never so secretly, the
Lord will finde it out. If it bee in
the forrest, the tree of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
shall cry vengeance, venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;
and the leaves of the tree
shall answere it. If in the fielde,
the beast of the field shal cry ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance,
vengeance; and the bird of
the ayre shall answere it. If in the
house, the stone out of the wall
shall cry vengeance, vengeance;
&amp; the ioynt out of the timber shal
answere it. Where ever it be, the
whole frame of heaven and earth
shall cry vengeance, vengeance;
and hell shall open her mouth and
answer it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="26"/> And doth secret murther crie
for vengeance, and hath not open
murther the same cry? Yes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly:
And heere I must
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:12742:57"/>
needs taxe a vice, which formerly
(in this kingdom) hath much raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
amongst Nobles and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
If they received any word
of disgrace, they would present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
challenge one another to the
field, revenge their owne quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels,
and trye it out with the point
of the sword, not without great
iniurie to the King and his Lawe,
whom the Lord hath made<note n="a" place="margin">Ro. 13. 4</note> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venger
of wrongs; yea, to the
King of kings: for<note n="b" place="margin">Ro. 12. 19</note> vengeance is
mine, and I will repay, sayth the
Lord. Should Subiects thus goe
to single Combates for private
quarrels? Is this courage? Is this
valour? No, no, it is nothing else
but rashnesse and folly. If you
would be truly valorous, then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
your selves for your Prince
and your Countrey, for Christ,
and for his true Religion. This
indeed would argue a noble cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:12742:58"/>
and a generous spirit. But
these private quarrels are most la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable.
O how many fathers
by these ungodly means have bin
made childlesse? how many chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
fatherlesse? how many wives
have lost their husbands? how
many Gentlemen whose aunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours
have beene principall studs
and pillers in their Country, have
by those desperate combates rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
themselves and their poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity?
O miserable incounters,
wherein the very Conquerours
gaine no other garland, but shame
and confusion, either to lose their
lives by order of Lawe, or to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
their owne Countrey, and so
to live in perpetuall exile, with
anguish and vexation of spirit. O
happy therfore, and thrice happy
be the Lords Anointed, who set
out that gracious proclamation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Duels, so much tending to
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:12742:58"/>
the glory of God, and the good
of this kingdome.</p>
            <p>Here I exhort all such as desire <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="27"/>
to enioy a quiet conscience, that
they take heed of this crying sin.
For if there be no other to accuse
the murtherer, his own co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science
will accuse him. Hee may for a
time have a slumbring co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science:
but when it wakens it will tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
him. We read of one<note n="a" place="margin">Pluta. de ijs qui sero a numme pumuntur.</note> 
               <hi>Bes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>
who had kild his owne father,
&amp; of a time hearing but a Swallow
chatter, he caught the truncheon
of a iaveling, and did fling at it
with wonderfull violence. And
being demanded why hee did so,
hee answered, Did you not heare
this wicked bird accuse mee, as
though I had killed mine owne
father. Whereupon hee was exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
and confessed the fact. So
<note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 4. 14</note> 
               <hi>Cain,</hi> when hee had killed his
brother, thought that every one
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:12742:59"/>
that met him would kil him. Such
is the nature of an accusing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
He that hath shed innocent
blood, hee will think that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ground hee goeth on is embru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with blood, that his garments
are besprinkled with blood, that
his fingers distill with blood. If
he heare two talke, he will think
they whisper of blood. If hee
wake, hee will thinke of blood.
And if he sleep, hee will dreame
of blood.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="28"/> And verely, if <hi>Davids</hi> consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
had not beene benummed,
hee would have thought that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
bird had chattered <hi>Vrias,</hi>
that every winde had whistled <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias,</hi>
that woods and mountaines
had sounded <hi>Vrias,</hi> and that the
Eccho had redoubled <hi>Vrias, Vrias.</hi>
But, now <hi>David,</hi> to his other sins
addeth dulnesse, and hardness of
heart.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:12742:59"/>
Thus poor <hi>Vrias</hi> is taken away,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="28"/>
a man vertuous and valorous, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
in his life, &amp; honorable
in his death. For he died fighting
in the forefront of the Lords bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell,
and the face of his enemies.
Whereby hee is now dispatched
out of the way, hee will bee no
more hinderance or obstacle un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them: and therfore let us now
see what course they take.</p>
            <p>When newes came to Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/>
that <hi>Vrias</hi> was slaine, the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
she<note n="c" place="margin">2 Sam. 11. 26</note> mourned: with what
minde I know not; but the Text
testifies that she mourned. Which
we may conceive to have been in
this, or the like manner. O <hi>Vrias,</hi>
my husband, my sweet husband
<hi>Vrias!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How long this mourning lasted,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="31"/>
I dare not define. The Wiseman
saith,<note place="margin">Ecc. 22. 12</note> 
               <hi>Seaven dayes doe men mourne
for him that is dead.</hi> If <hi>Bathshebah</hi>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:12742:60"/>
mourned no longer, it was very
fitting for <hi>Davids</hi> purpose. In the
booke of <hi>Deutronomy</hi> the captive
woman is commanded to bewail
her father and her mother a full
moneth.<note place="margin">Deut. 21 13</note> And so long (saith <hi>Peter
Martyre)</hi> is <hi>Bathsheba</hi> supposed to
have bewailed her husband:<note place="margin">Vpon 2 Sa. c. 11</note> and
longer in all probabilitie it could
not bee. So, after a while, the
clowds of sorrow were dispelled,
and the sunne did shine upon her
with his golden beames. For <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
sent for her: so shee became
his wife, and bare him a sonne;
which was borne in marriage: &amp;
considering the ordinary acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
which usually happen to
women in that case, and cause
them to come before their time,
it might also be charitably and
probably supposed, even to bee
gotten in marriage also. Thus the
adultery is covered, the eyes of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:12742:60"/>
the world are bleared, <hi>Bathsheba</hi>
becomes a Queen, <hi>David</hi> enioyes
his Darling; and now hee might
say with him in the Poet, in the
like case, <hi>Vicimus exclamat, mecum

man. Come wee now to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
branch, how he went about
to hide it from God himselfe.
This I gather out of the 32. <hi>Psalm,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psa. 32. 3</note>
               <hi>When I kept silence, my bones waxed
old;</hi> that is, while I did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
it unto the Lord, as appeares
by that which followeth; <hi>I sayd
I will confesse my transgression unto
the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ver. 5</note> 
               <hi>and thou forgavest the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
of my sinne.</hi> What was this
else, but so much as in him lay, to
hide and conceale it from the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting
God?</p>
            <p>O <hi>David,</hi> What doost thou <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="33"/>
meane? Though thou couldest
hide it from the eyes of man, yet
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:12742:61"/>
thou canst not hide it from the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing
eye of God.<note n="f" place="margin">psa. 139</note> 
               <hi>Whither
wilt thou flie from his spirit, or whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wilt thou goe from his presence?
If thou ascend into heaven, he is there;
if thou make thy bedde in hell, hee is
there; if thou take the vvings of
the morning, and dwell in the
uttermost partes of the sea, even
there shall his hand leade thee, and his
right hand hold thee; if thou shalt say,
the darkness shall cover me, even the
night shall bee light about thee, &amp;c.</hi>
Therfore thou canst not hide thy
selfe from him; <hi>He is about thy bed,
and about thy path, and spieth out all
thy wayes.</hi> Hee spyed thee when
thou walkedst so idlely upon the
toppe of thy house; he spyed all
thy wandring and thy wanton
looks; hee sawe thy very heart,
by what degrees it was infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with carnall concupis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.
There is not a word in thy
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:12742:61"/>
tongue, but he knoweth it altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Hee heard thee when thou
enquiredst so vainly after the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
hee heard thee when thou
wast so foolish, as to send for her;
hee heard thee when thou wast so
lewd as to tempt her unto sinne;
yea, hee both heard thee, and saw
thee, and looked upon thee with
fiery and flaming eyes, when thou
wast not ashamed to commit that
filthy abhomination. Wherefore
let no man goe about to hide him
self from the eyes of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
For thus saith the Lord, <hi>Though
they digge into hell,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Amos. 9. 2</note> 
               <hi>thence shall my
hand take them; though they climbe
up to heaven, thence will I bring them
downe; and though they hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
in the toppe of Carmel, I will
search and take them out thence; and
though they be hid from my sight in the
bottome of the sea, thence will I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the serpent, and hee shall bite
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:12742:62"/>
them.</hi> Wherfore let all men stand
in awe, and sinne not. But if they
have sinned, the best counsel that
I can give them, is to humble
their soules, and to confesse their
sinnes to God, with speedy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.
For<note n="b" place="margin">pro. 28 13</note> 
               <hi>he that covereth
his sins shall not prosper: but hee that
confesseth and for saketh them shal find
mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="34"/> Here observe the different pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
of God and man. Man
goeth about to conceale it: but
God will have it revealed. <hi>David</hi>
would conceal it to avoid shame:
but God wil reveal it &amp; fil his face
with shame, that so by shame hee
may bring him to glory. For so
long as it was concealed, he repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
not; but so soon as it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed,
he repented all the dayes
of his life. And that which is
more, God will not onely have it
revealed, but also recorded in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:12742:62"/>
Scripture, for all succeeding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
Yea <hi>David</hi> him selfe, after he
repented, left the 51. <hi>Psalme,</hi> as a
pillar of brasse,<note place="margin">Psa. 51. 14</note> wherein his blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiltinesse
is ingraven; and so
transmitted to all posterity.</p>
            <p>And as the Lord did detect it,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/>
so hee did likewise correct it. For
though in his unspeakeable mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
he said, <hi>Thou shalt not die;</hi> yet
because hee slew <hi>Vrias</hi> with the
sword, therefore the Lord, the
righteous Iudge, did punish him
in the like kinde. Wherefore let
all men take heed by this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.

so the Lord did unto him.

               <hi>Iezabel</hi> under the walls
of Iezreel. But this present exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>David</hi> is most memorable.
For, as hee slew <hi>Vrias</hi> with the
sword; even so the sword did hang
over his own house. First,<note n="e" place="margin">2 Sa. 13 28</note> 
               <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>
the sonne of <hi>David</hi> was slaine
with the sword, by the command
of his owne brother <hi>Absalon.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<hi>Absalon</hi> the sonne of
<hi>David,</hi> did drawe his sword a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:12742:63"/>
his owne father. Thirdly,
<hi>Absalon</hi> himselfe was not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hanged by the haire of the
head, and stricken through with
darts, but he was likewise smitten
<note n="f" place="margin">2 Sam. 18. 15</note> by ten men. Fourthly, <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
drew the sword of iustice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his owne brother<note n="g" place="margin">2 Sam. 2. 25</note> 
               <hi>Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niah,</hi>
who perished with the
sword. Wherfore, let all men fear
and tremble, to plot (be it never
so cunningly) against the life of a
man; the Lord doth see it, &amp; will
punish it. And let all men pray to
God to preserve them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being
instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of evil; by the example
of <hi>Ioab,</hi> whose blood also was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
shed, even while he took
hold upon the<note n="h" place="margin">1 Reg. 2 31</note> horns of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar.
Thus much concerning the
first generall part; that is, the sinne
of <hi>David.</hi> Now it remayneth that
I should proceed unto the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d;
that is, to his repentance. But that
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:12742:64"/>
must be handled some other time,
if so it shall please the Lord, <hi>In cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ius
manu &amp; nos &amp; opera nostra.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="36"/> Now, to conclude, let no man
compare mee to <hi>Cham;</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
to display the nakednes of
his father; nor yet to those foule
flyes which loue to spot the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
flower. For, for mine owne
part, I had rather bewaile mine
owne infirmities, then blaze the
imperfections of another: especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
of such as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheba,</hi>
who (this excepted) were
holy servants of God; and both
of them,<note n="*" place="margin">1 Chro. 3. 5</note> progenitors of Iesus
Christ, whether wee respect the
legall line by <hi>Salomon</hi> or the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
by <hi>Nathan.</hi> Yet I have laid o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
the sinne of <hi>David</hi> somewhat
largely; in two severall Sermons.
First, that man seeing the great
nesse of his sinne, may the better
consider the greatnesse of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:12742:64"/>
Secondly, that consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the haynousness of his sin,
wee may the more magnifie the
mercy of God, in pardoning the
same. Thirdly, that wee behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in him our owne infirmitie,
may stand in awe and not sinne.
Lastly, that those which haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
sinned, in the like manner
as <hi>David,</hi> may not despaire: but
as they haue sinned with <hi>David,</hi>
so they may repent with <hi>David;</hi>
that their soules may be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and God glorified:
which the Lord
grant, &amp;c.</p>
