         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The holy ſervice of God, which the <hi>Latines</hi> called <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
becauſe it knitted the mindes of men together, and moſt

            <p>The Scribes they could call in their proper ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

wee have catcht from the Latine <hi>Pergamenum, Boc-fell</hi> in

            <p>

            <p>The certaine and inward knowledge of that which is
in our minde, be it good or bad, which in the Latine word
we call <hi>Conſcience,</hi> they called <hi>Inwit,</hi> as that which they

they called <hi>Fortha-fader,</hi> as <hi>Abavus, Fiftha-fader.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An <hi>Eunuch,</hi> for whome we have no name, but from the

without learning.</p>
            <p>A Covetous man whome we ſo call of the <hi>French Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voitiſe,</hi>
they truely called <hi>Git-ſor,</hi> as a fore &amp; eagre <hi>Getter,</hi> and

            <p>That which the Latines call <hi>Abortus,</hi> and wee in many

any thing detracted more from the dignitie of our tongue,

yoaked the Engliſh vnder their tongue, as they did vnder

whenas in his time he ſaith, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Welſh</hi> delighted

But now will I conclude this trifling diſcourſe
with a true tale out of an antient Hiſtorian.</p>
            <p>Of the effectuall power of words, great diſputes have
beene of great wits in all ages; the <hi>Pithagoreans</hi> extolled it,
the impious Iewes aſcribed all miracles to a name which
was ingravened in the reveſtiarie of the Temple, watched
by two brazen dogges, which one ſtale away and enſeamed
it in his thigh, as you may reade in <hi>Oſorius de Sapientia,</hi> and
the like in <hi>Rabi Hamas Speculation:</hi> and ſtrange it is what
<hi>Samonicus Serenus</hi> aſcribed to the word ABRADACABRA, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
agues. But there was one true Engliſh word of as
great, if not greater force than them all, now out of all vſe
and will be thought for ſound barbarous; but therefore of
more efficacie (as it pleaſeth <hi>Porphyrie</hi>) and in ſignification
it ſignifieth as it ſeemeth, no more then abiect, baſe minded,
falſe harted, coward, or nidget. Yet it hath levied Armies,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:7819:19"/>
and ſubdued rebellious enemies; and that I may hold you
no longer, it is <hi>Niding.</hi>
               <note place="margin">William Malmſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.</note> For when there was a daungerous
rebellion againſt King <hi>William Rufus,</hi> and <hi>Rocheſter</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
then the moſt important &amp; ſtrongeſt fort of this Realm
was ſtowtly kept againſt him, after that he had but proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
that his ſubiects ſhould repaire thither to his Campe,
vpon no other penaltie, but that whoſoever refuſed to come,

from all ſides in ſuch numbers, that he had in few daies
an infinite Armie, and the rebells therewith weere ſo terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
that they forthwith yeelded. While I runne on in this

            <p>And I doubt not but they will confeſſe that Townes

            <p>It may alſo be prooved that many places which nowe

taken vp by themſelves, if they were owners of the place,

but the concurrent voyce of the people, as the women
neighbours gave the name to <hi>Obed</hi> in the booke of <hi>Ruth;</hi>

terme them, from floures, fiſhes, birdes, habitudes, &amp;c: it
may bee thought that they came from Nurſes in former

crownes, vpon the ſame condition. But to retyre to our
purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Not a few have aſſumed the names of their fathers
Baronies, as in former times the iſſue of <hi>Richard Fitz-Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi>
tooke the name of <hi>Clare,</hi> which was their Barony: and
in late time, ſince the <hi>Suttons</hi> came to the Barony of <hi>Dud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi>
all their iſſue tooke the name of <hi>Dudleyes:</hi> that I may
omit others. The diſlike of others hath cauſed alſo a
change of names, for King <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, diſliking the
iteration of <hi>Fitz,</hi> commanded the Lord <hi>Iohn Fitz-Robert,</hi>
a moſt ancient Baron,<note place="margin">Lib. Monaſterii Sibeton.</note> (whoſe Anceſtours had continued
their Surnames by their fathers Chriſtian names,) to leave
that manner, and to be called <hi>Iohn Clavering,</hi> which was
the capitall ſeate of his Barony. And in this time, many that
had followed that courſe of naming by <hi>Fitz,</hi> tooke them
one ſetled name, and retained it as <hi>Fitz Walter,</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>Alſo at that time the names of <hi>Thomſon, Richardſon,
Willſon,</hi> and other of that forme began to be ſetled, which
before had varied according to the name of the father. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
the fourth likewiſe (as I have heard,) loving ſome
whoſe name was <hi>Picard,</hi> would often tell them that hee
loved them well, but not their names, wherevpon ſome of
them changed their names: and I have heard that one of
them which tooke the name of <hi>Ruddle,</hi> being the place of
his birth in that reſpect. And in late yeares in the time of
King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, an ancient worſhipfull gentleman
of <hi>Wales,</hi> being called at the panniell of Iury by the name
of <hi>Thomas Ap William, Ap Thomas, Ap Richard, Ap Hoel,
Ap Evan <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>aghan, &amp;c.</hi> was adviſed by the Iudge to leave
that old manner. Wherevpon he after called himſelfe <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston,</hi>
according to the name of his principall houſe, and left
that Surname to his poſterity.</p>
            <p>Offices have brought new names to divers families, as

the Earles of <hi>Ormond</hi> and others deſcended from them,
tooke the name of <hi>Butler.</hi> So the diſtinct families of the
<hi>Conſtables</hi> in the County of <hi>Yorke,</hi> are ſaide to have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
that name, from ſome of their Anceſtours which bare
the office of Conſtables of ſome Caſtles. In Like manner
the <hi>Stewards, Marſhalls, Spencers.</hi> That I may ſay nothing
of ſuch as for well acting on the ſtage, have carried away
the names of the perſonages which they acted, and have
loſt their owne names among the people.</p>
            <p>Schollers pride hath wrought alteration in ſome names
which have beene ſweetned in ſound, by drawing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

was found among them: But he profiting in learning, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<hi>Among vs,</hi> into <hi>Magnus,</hi> and was famous by that name,
not onely heere, but alſo in forraine places where he was
often Ambaſſadour.</p>
            <p>It were needeleſſe to note heere againe, how many
have taken in former times the Chriſtian name of their
father, with prefixing of <hi>Fitz</hi> or <hi>Filz,</hi> as <hi>Fitz-bugh, Fitz-alan,
Fitz-william,</hi> or adding of <hi>Son,</hi> as <hi>Richardſon, Tomſon,
Iohnſon, &amp;c.</hi> and ſo altered their Surnames if they had any.
Whereas divers ancient Gentlemen of <hi>England</hi> do beare
Coates of Armes, which by old roules and good proofes
are knowne to belong to other names and families, and
cannot make proofe that they matched with thoſe fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
it is worth obſervation, conſidering how religious
they were in elder times in keeping their owne Armes:
whether they were not of thoſe ancient houſes whoſe
Armes they beare, and have changed their names in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of their habitation, or partitions and lands gotten by

            <p>Finally, among the common people which ſway all in
names, many Surnames haue bene changed in reſpect of
occupations, and not a few have beene changed in reſpect
of maſters, for in every place we ſee the youth very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly

<hi>Thomas</hi> Taylor, <hi>Will</hi> Butcher, <hi>Dic</hi> Barber, and many
by their maſters names, as <hi>Iohn Pickering, Thomas Watkins,
Nicholas French,</hi> whenas they ſerved maiſters of thoſe
names, which often were conveyed to their poſteritie, and
their owne Surnames altogether forgotten. Some other
cauſes of alteration of names may be found, as for crimes
committed when men have beene enforced to leave their
countries. But heereby it may be vnderſtood that an <hi>Alias</hi>
or double name cannot preiudice the honeſt: and it is
knowne that when Iudge <hi>Catiline</hi> tooke exception at one

Yeoman, Gentleman, Eſquire. Addition of degree are
thoſe which wee call names of dignitie, as Knight, Earle,
Marqueſſe, Duke. Additions of myſterie are ſuch, Scrive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,

that his addition in one of them doth ſuffice.</p>
            <p>By the Statute the firſt yeere of king <hi>Henry</hi> the fift and

and place where he dwelleth, and that ſuch Writts ſhall

take exception thereat, they ſhall not abate by the office of
the court.</p>
            <p>Alſo, Duke, Marqueſſe, Earle, or Knight be none of
that addition, but names of dignitie, which ſhould have
beene given before the ſtatute. Aud this was ordained by
the ſayde ſtatnte, made in the firſt yeare of king <hi>Henry</hi> the
ſeaventh chap. 5. to the intent that one man may not be
grieved or troubled by the vtlary of an other, but that by

events; ſo that events conſequently muſt lurke in names,

particular experiments, and ſo enforce the matter, with
ſtrong words and weake proofes, that ſome credulous
yong men, hovering betweene hope and feare, might ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
be carried away by them into the forbidden ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Onomantia,</hi> or South-ſaying by names.</p>
            <p>But ſome of the ſower ſort will ſay it is nothing but a

condemne it, leſt by commending it, they ſhould diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend

nothing heerein.</p>
            <p>If profound antiquitie, or the inventour may commend
an invention, this will not give place to many. For as the
great Maſters of the Iewes teſtifie, <hi>Moſes</hi> received of God
a literall law, written by the finger of God, in the two Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
of the ten Commaundements to be imparted to all,

was ſerved, the limbes comforted, and peace re-eſtabliſhed.
Even ſo it fareth with the bodies of Common-weales; for albeit
the Princes gather much, yet not ſo much for themſelves, as for

God I were a man, and looke what I would doe. What?
By God goe forward with the beſt; for as my mother was

               <hi>His daughter</hi> Roper <hi>one day as ſhee repaired vnto him

ſaide he might doe, without ſcruple of conſcience, as moſt
of the Nobilitie of the Realme hadde doone, not once
ſticking thereat, ſave onely himſelfe, and one other man.
This ſpeach of her hee aunſwered with a pleaſaunt tale.</hi>
At a Bartholomew faire at London, there was an Eſcheater of
the ſame city, that had arrested a Clothier that was outlawed,
and had ſeized his goodes, which he had brought into the faire,
tolling him out of the faire by a traine. The man that was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested
was a Northerne man, which by his friendes made the
Eſcheator to be arreſted within the faire, vppon an Action I
not neere what, and called a Court of Pipowders. Now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ad
the Clothier, by friendſhip of the Officers, found the meanes to
have all the Quest almost made of the Northerne men, ſuch
as had their Boothes ſtanding in the faire, who were no ſooner
departed from the barre, and come into the houſe, but the
Northerne men were agreed, and in effect all the other, to caſt
our London Eſcheater. They thought they needed no were to
proove that hee did wrong, than even the name of his bare of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
alone. But then was there amongeſt them, as the Divell
woulde, an honeſt man of another quarter called <hi>Company.</hi>
And the fellow ſeemed but a ſeely ſoule, and ſate ſtill, and ſayde
nothing; they made noreckoning of him, but ſaide. We be agreed
now, come, let vs goe and give vp our verdict. Then when the
poore fellow ſawe that they made ſuch haſle, and his minde no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
gave him that way that theirs did (if that their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ndes
gave them that way they ſaide,) hee prayed them to tarry and
talke vpon the matter, and tell ſuch reaſon therein, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ee
might thinke as they did, and when they ſhould ſo doe, be would
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:7819:118"/>
be glad to ſay with them; or elſe hee ſaide they muſt pardon
him: For ſith <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ee had a ſoule of his owne to keepe, as they had,
be muſt ſay as he thought for his ſoule, as they muſt for theirs.
When they heard this they were halfe angry with him, What
good fellow, (quoth one of the Northerne men) whare wannes
thou? Be not we eleaven heere, and thou but one all alone, and
al we agreed, whereto ſhouldſt thou ſticke? Whates thy name
gud fellow? Maiſters (quoth he) my name is called <hi>Company.
Company</hi> (quoth they) now by my troth good felow, play then
the gud companion, come thereon foorth with vs, and paſſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
for gude company. Would God good maiſters (quoth the
man againe) that there lay no more weight thereon. But now,
when we ſhall hence, and come before God, and that hee ſhall
ſend you vnto heaven for doing according vnto your conſcience,
and me to the divell, for doing againſt mine, al paſſing at your
requeſt heere for good company now, By God Maiſter <hi>Dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenſon</hi>
(that was one of the Northerne mens names,) If I
then ſhall ſay vnto you al againe; Maiſters, I went once with
you for good company, which is the cauſe that I goe now to hell,
play you the good felowes now againe with mee, as I went then
for good company with you, ſo ſome of you go now for good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
with me: would you goe maiſter <hi>Dickenſon?</hi> Nay, nay, by
our Lady, nor never a one of you all. And therefore muſt you
pardon me for paſſing as you paſſe; for the paſſage of my poore
ſoule paſſeth all good company.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the like ſence he vſed often to ſay,</hi> That he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
pinne his ſoule at another mans backe, not even the beſt
man that he knew that day living; for he knew not whither he
might hap to carry it.</p>
            <p>When one came to him, to ſignifie that hee muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
himſelfe to die, for hee coulde not live, he called for
his vrinall, wherein when hee had made water, hee caſt
it, and viewed it (as Phyſitions vſe) at laſt hee ſaide ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly,
<hi>That hee ſaw nothing in that water, but that he might
live, if it pleaſed the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When he was in priſon, and his bookes and papers ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

and way was beſt to be taken, to vnderſtand the
obſcure places in Saint <hi>Paules</hi> Epiſtles: he anſwered him
he thought the beſt and ſhorteſt way was, to reade firſt
the latter parte of thoſe Epiſtles, which dooth intreate of
Chriſtian manners, and vnderſtand it, and expreſſe it in
life and good manners; and then to go vnto the firſt part,
where the matters of faith are ſubtily and exactly handled,
ſaying; <hi>That God wil give his ſpirite of vnderſtanding ſoonest
vnto thoſe, that with al their whole hearts ſeeke to ſerve him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>He was wont to ſay,</hi> That he and all other Biſhops ought

of their Dioceſes, but father Iudges.</p>
            <p>In communication when mention hapned to be made
of a certaine Biſhoppe, who was woont to blame the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
that lived at <hi>Rome,</hi> and neglected their charge, and
yet he himſelfe was reſident at <hi>Rome. He</hi> (quoth <hi>Poole) doth
like vnto thoſe that cannot abide the ſmel of garlicke, for if they
have to do with them that have eaten garlike, they eate ſome too

(<hi>quoth</hi> Poole) doth worke almoſt that in yong men, that wine

            <p>He vſed friendly to admoniſh a certaine Biſhop, not

            </p>
            <p>Having heard a certaine Preacher of great name, who
arrogated much to himſelfe, and did paſſingly pleaſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe;
hee was asked what hee thought of the man. <hi>Poole</hi>
aunſwered; <hi>Well, but I would that hee would firſt preach vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

            </p>
            <p>When a Nobleman of <hi>Rome</hi> tolde him, that hee did
truſt that he ſhould come to his pleaſaunt gardines, which
hee had ſumptuouſly made, yea thirtie yeeres after, and
wonder at the beauty of them. <hi>Poole</hi> anſwered, <hi>I hope I

            </p>
            <p>While he was in the Low countries, and one day would

of <hi>Arras</hi> was ſent vnto him by the Emperour, to excuſe

ſayde, that hee had ſtrange happe, <hi>That whereas be ſpake

               <hi>He vſed often to ſay,</hi> Thoſe which would betake them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the ſtudy of the holy Scriptures, (which was as though they
would goe into the inner and ſecret parte of the Temple) muſt
paſſe thorow a lowe and a narrow doore: For that no man can

that they never went to the reading of them with this intent and
minde, that they might diſpute of them to ſhew their learning,
and by that knowledge to get them honors and riches: for both

Sidney,</hi> and by the Gentleman which
proued that Poets were the firſt <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians,</hi>
the firſt <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> the firſt
<hi>Historiographers.</hi> I will onely adde
out of <hi>Philo,</hi> that they were Gods
owne creatures, who in his Booke <hi>de Plantatione Noe,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth,
that when he had made the whole worlds maſſe;
he created Poets to celebrate and ſet out the Creator him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
and all the creatures: you Poëts read the place and
you will like it. Howſoeuer it pleaſeth the <hi>Italian</hi> to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
vs, yet neither doth the Sunne ſo farre retire his charri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot
from our Climate, neither are there leſſe fauourable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
betweene <hi>Mercurie, Iupiter,</hi> and the Moone, in our
inclination of heauen, if Poëts are <hi>Fato,</hi> as it pleaſed <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
neither are our Poets deſtitute of Arte preſcribed by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and grounded vpon experience, but they are as preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
both in witty conceits and deuiſes, and alſo in imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as any of them. Yea and according to the argument ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
in granditie and grauity, in ſmoothneſſe and proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
in quickneſſe and briefneſſe. So that for skill, varietie,
efficacie, and ſweetneſſe, the foure materiall points requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in a Poët, they can both teach and delight perfectly.</p>
            <p>This would eaſily appeare if any lines were extant of
that worthy <hi>Britiſh</hi> Lady <hi>Claudia Rufina,</hi> ſo commended
by <hi>Martial,</hi> or of <hi>Gildas</hi> which <hi>Lilius Giraldus</hi> ſawe in the
libraries of <hi>Italie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Beda Eccl. hiſt. lib. 4. cap. 24.</note> or of old <hi>Chedmon</hi> who by diuine inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
about the yeare 680. became ſo diuine a Poët in our
Engliſh tongue, that with his ſweete verſes full of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction,
he withdrew many from vice to vertue, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
feare of God: or of our <hi>Claudius Clemens</hi> one of
the firſt founders of the Vniuerſity of <hi>Paris:</hi> and doth moſt
clearely appeare to all that can iudge by many learned

happen of an vncouth word, let the time entreate pardon
for it, when as all words haue their times, and as he ſaith.</p>
