            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </gap>; for so are they here all ranked. 3. To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the Question, who is the blessed man, is competent to God only, in whose hand alone it is to make a man blessed; for here he taketh it upon him, to pronounce the godly man <hi>to be the blessed man.</hi> 4. The ungodly doe think themselves very wise in following the counsell of their own heart, and of others like themselves, that they may be blessed; But this is not the way of the blessed man, <hi>He walketh not in the counsel of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly.</hi> 5. The ungodly do obstinately continue in the course of sinning, but the blessed man, if he be overtaken in a sinne, doth not defend his sinne, nor persist in it: <hi>Hee standeth not in the way of sinners.</hi> 6. The ungodly may come to that height at length, as to mock godlinesse, as meet folly, and to scorne ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions and reproofs: But the blessed man doth never har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den his heart so, as to mock piety in others, or instruction offered to himselfe, <hi>He sitteth not in the seat of the scornfull.</hi> 7. The blessed man maketh the word of God in holy Scripture, to be his Counseller concerning the remedie of sinne and misery, and to be the rule to walk by, til his blessednesse be perfected; for the Scripture to him, for the obedience of faith, is a Law, and that fenced with supreme authority: <hi>It is the Law of the Lord.</hi> 8. In that measure that a man is godly and blessed, hee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the word of God, which holdeth forth the way of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with God, through the Messiah, Christ, the way of growing in communion with God through him, the matter of his chief delight, and contentment; <hi>His delight is in the Law of the Lord.</hi> 9. In that measure that a man delighteth in the Law of the Lord, he verseth himselfe therin upon all occasions. <hi>In his Law doth he meditate day and night.</hi>

               <p>This is the first reason proving the Godly man to bee the only Blessed man, and not the ungodly: Hence learn, 1. In that measure a man studieth holy Communion with God, by delighting and meditating in his word, he shall bee fixed and furnished with the influence of Grace from Christ, for the entertaining of Spiritual Life in him; <hi>Hee shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water.</hi> 2. The man that maketh the word of God his delight, shall be made fruitfull in every good worke, as opportunity is offered to him; <hi>Hee shall bee like the tree that bringeth forth his fruit in his season.</hi> 3. This man shall be enabled to bear out a holy profession of his faith in, and obedience to God, in adversity, as well as in prosperity: <hi>His leaf also shall not wither.</hi> 4. Whatsoever Duty or Service to God this man goeth about, shall not want the assistance of God, nor successe, nor acceptance at his hands; <hi>Whatsoever hee doth shall prosper.</hi> 5. The ungodly man (whatsoever hee may seeme to be before the world) yet hee is destitute of all Spirituall Life, and alien from the fellowship of Gods grace, unfit for every good work, ready when tempted hard, to quit his counterfeit profession of Religion, and is cursed in all that hee doth; for what the blessed Godly man is here said to bee, the wicked is the contrary; <hi>The ungodly are not so.</hi> 6. Whatsoever appearance of godlinesse, or temporal prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or hope of happinesse the ungodly man seemeth to have, it shall be found but counterfeit, and shal stand him in no stead in his greatest need<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>

               <p>The second reason proving the Godly man to be the <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed man,</hi> and not the ungodly, is a consequence of the first: Whence learn, 1. Not only shall all that the ungodly man soweth to his fleshly Felicity, prove <hi>chaffe</hi>; but also for his paines he shall answer to God in the day of judgement, and there be condemned; for it is said, <hi>Therfore the ungodly shall

not stand in the judgment.</hi> 2. Howsoever the Godly cann<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> enjoy one anothers fellowship in this life, for many reasons; yet at last they shall meet in a generall Assembly of all Saints, in the full fellowship of God; for there is a day of Judgement to bee, wherein they shall stand, and not be casten or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, but shall be fully absolved, and remain in the <hi>stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Congregation of the Righteous.</hi> 3. Albeit now the ungodly and godly do live together, mixed in one Kingdome, City, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporation, visible Church, Family, and Bed, possibly, yet there shall be a perfect separation at last, of the one from the other; for sinners (or servants of sin) <hi>shall not stand in the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Righteous.</hi>

               <p>The third reason confirmeth the former two: Whence learn, 1. Albeit there be no man that liveth and sinneth not, yet the godly man, being justified by faith, and carefull to bring forth the fruits of faith, is not a sinner in Gods esteeme; for hee is here called <hi>Righteous.</hi> 2. However there be many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections and failings of the Godly mans actions, yet the course hee keepeth, and way which hee endeavoureth to walke in, is holy and acceptable to God; <hi>For the Lord knoweth,</hi> or <hi>appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Christ by his Prophet doth here reveal; for this is the speech of Christ the Son of God, to be incarnate, speaking by his spirit, concerning the stability of the Church, and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome over it: Whence we learne. 1. The faith of the Saints, in time of the persecution of the Church, may, and should rest perswaded of the stability of the Church, and of Christs King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in it, because it is grounded upon the mysterious and unchangeable decree of God, which here is brought to light, <hi>I will declare the decree,</hi> saith Christ, not as yet incarnate. 2.

The Son of God as he is a person, concurring in the decree of establishing of the Church, and Kingdome of God in it, against all opposition; So is he party contracter in the Covenant of Redemption: And as he is the promiser, and undertaker to pay the price of the Redemption of his people; so also is he the receiver of promises, made in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of his Church and Kingdome: It is he to whom the Father directeth his promise concerning his Church, <hi>first and immediately</hi>; for the Son in declaring the decree, saith, <hi>The Lord said to me.</hi> 4.

Church, maugre all the opposition of all the power in the world; for to this very end is the decree of revealing Christ to be the Son of God<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> here declared. <hi>Thou art my Son whom I have bogotten,</hi> is proof abundant; for this is the Rock where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Christ undertaketh to build his Church, against which the gates of hel shal not prevaile, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.16.18. and <hi>who is he that overcometh the world,</hi> saith <hi>Iohn, save he that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth that Christ is the Son of God</hi>? 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.5. 6. Another article of the Covenant of Redemption here declared is, That after Christs Resurrection, and declaration of his formerly over-clouded God-head, he should continue in the office of his mediation, and intercession; and by vertue of his payed ransome of Redemption, call for the enlargement of his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased Kingdome among the Gentiles; for this is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers compact with the Son, saying, <hi>Ask of me, and I will give thee the Heathen.</hi> 7.

Though it may seem wisdome to make and execute lawes in prejudice of Christ, and his cause, rather then vent their malice without a pretence; yet it is more wisdome to cease from opposition, and take lawes from Christ; for so the Lord doth reckon, saying, <hi>Be wise now therefore, and instructed.</hi> 3. If any be guilty of this sinne, and not as yet smitten for it, the goodnesse of God offereth to him mercy in time, and steppeth in timously to take off the snares of flatterers, who use to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den men, and especially great men, in this sinne: <hi>Be wise now,</hi> saith the Lord, <hi>O yee Kings.</hi> 4. It is no disparagement to the greatest Monarchs (but a mean for them to eschue the wrath of God) to be subject to Christ Jesus, to stand in awe of him, to submit themselves to him, and promove his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to their power; for the command to all, and to them in special, is, <hi>Serve the Lord in fear.</hi> 5.

The conscience of seeking God by prayer is an ease to a man, not only for the time present, while he is in prayer pouring out his heart; but refreshful also, when 'tis looked back upon: therefore by way of gratulation saith <hi>David</hi> here, <hi>I cryed to the Lord.</hi> 2.

When the Lord will answer the believer to his comfort, he can not only satisfie him in the particular which he prayeth for, but also furnish him with confidence against whatsoever evil can be apprehended by him for time to come: <hi>I will not be afraid of Millions of people, that have set themselves against mee round about.</hi> 8. When faith finds it self welcome to God, 'tis able to give a defiance to all adversaries; more or fewer, weaker or stronger enemies, all are alike despised: <hi>I wil not be afraid of thousands of people.</hi>

Meer natural men cannot be made wise, neither by the word of God, nor by experience in their own, and others persons, to consider that things of this earth, as temporarie riches, honour, and pleasure, are nothing but vanity, and deceiving lies, which promise some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and pay nothing but vexation of spirit, because of guiltinesse and misery following upon the abuse of them. <hi>How long will ye love vanity, and seek after leasing?</hi> 5.

Therefore, <hi>know,</hi> saith <hi>David,</hi> as speaking to ignorants, <hi>That God hath set apart for himself, him that is godly.</hi> 7.

The meane prescribed of God for to make the heart sensible of its condition, is the serious and daily examination of the conscience, posing it to answer all interrogatories concerning the mans conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to Gods law, and that in <hi>secret,</hi> in the <hi>night,</hi> without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction: for a man had neede to have his wits about him, when hee goeth to examine a deceitful thiefe: to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose saith hee, <hi>Commune with your hearts on your beds.</hi> 3. The fruit of daily, serious examination of the conscience, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning sinne committed, is, to make a man humble, quiet, and submissive to the Lord: this he insinuateth in foretelling them that thus they <hi>shall be still, or silent,</hi> not opening the mouth to excuse their sinnes, or to mock the godly.

The comfort of Gods Spirit, and sense of a mans reconciliation with God in Christ, is greater then any worldly joy can be, and is able to supply the want of riches, honors, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures worldly, and to season, yea and swallow up the sense of poverty, disgrace, and whatsoever other evill.

The faith which the godly have in the mercies of God, doth encourage them to follow the service of God; and in some cases doth give them hope to be loosed from the restraints which doe hinder them from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying the publick Ordinances: <hi>I will come into thy house, in the multitude of thy mercies.</hi> 3. The right temper of the heart of a true Worshipper, is feare before God: <hi>In thy feare will I worship.</hi> 4. Under the sense of sinfulnesse and unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, faith must be supported by looking toward Jesus Christ, prefigured by the Tabernacle and Temple<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>

So much the more as the godly are sensible of their own blindnesse, and weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and readinesse to go out of the right way; so much the more doe they call for, and depend upon Gods directing of them. <hi>Lead me,</hi> saith hee; As one that seeth not, or as one who is not able to hold a right course, without a guide. 7. If the godly man take a sinful course, to be relieved from his trouble, the enemie is hardned in his wicked course, by this means to blaspheme the profession of Piety, as meere hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie, and so God is provoked to let the enemie prevaile, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the miscarriage of the godly hath made way to him; for avoiding of which inconvenience, he prayeth: <hi>Lead mee, in thy righteousness because of my enemies.</hi> 8. The deceitfulnesse of sin, the ignorance of what is expedient and lawful in a particular case, the mist of private affections, and the example of ill counsel of the World, are ready to make a man mistake the right way, except the Lord make clear what is his duty: Therefore saith he, <hi>Make thy way straight before my face.</hi>

               <p>In the fourth place he strengtheneth his hope to be helped, because his enemies sins were ripe for judgment. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Among other motives to make the godly take heede of their carriage in time of trial, this is one, they have to doe with a false world, and hollow hearted men, who will make false pretences of what is not their intentions, and will make promise of what they mind not to performe, and wil give none but rotten and poisonable advice, fairded with false flattery, and all to deceive the godly, and draw them in a snare. This is it, he saith, <hi>For there is no faithfulnesse in their mouth, their inward part is very wickednesse, their throat is an open sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre, they flatter with their tongue</hi>: and this is the nature of all carnal men, when it cometh to the point of defending Gods cause in time of trial. 2. Though this prayer bee not to be drawne in imitation against particular persons, by us who have not so infallible revelation of mens state before God, yet is it a prophesie against all the irreconcilable enemies of God, and of his people, against whom the Spirit of God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth imprecation here, saying, <hi>Destroy thou them O God.</hi> 3. There is no need of any other means to destroy the Lords enemies, then their own devices: The very course they take to establish themselves, will serve for their owne ruine. <hi>Let them fal,</hi> saith he, <hi>by their own counsel.</hi> 4. The certain cause of the ruine of the persecuters of Gods people, is the ripenesse and ful measure of their sinnes. <hi>Cast them out</hi> (saith he) <hi>in the multitude of their transgressions.</hi> 5. The opppsing of truth, and of the Ordinances of God, in the person of his servants who stand for the same, is not simply the opposing of mortal men, but the opposing of God, whose quarrel it is; Therefore, saith hee, <hi>They have rebelled against thee.</hi>

Persecution for righteousnesse is a cause common to all believers, wherein they should all joyn, and pray one of them for another, and seeke for a joyful out-gate each to other in their owne time. for this cause, after prayer against enemies, he saith, <hi>But let all that trust in thee rejoyce.</hi> 2. The manifested care of God for his people, in protecting and delivering them from their enemies, is matter of exceeding joy to his people, because hee is glorified herein, and his Church is preserved: <hi>Let them ever shout f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A renewed blenk of the Lords countenance wil satisfie a soule in greatest distresse: Therefore <hi>David</hi> craveth this for a remedie of all his sorrow, <hi>Returne, O Lord.</hi> 2. If desertion continue, feare of perishing utterly doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent it selfe; as this prayer insinuateth, <hi>O Lord, deliver my soul.</hi> 3. The only time to spread the praise of God, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king mention of him before them that know him not, is the time of this life: <hi>For in death there is no remembrance of thee.</hi> 4. The Christians love of life, should proceed from the love of honouring of God in this life, (where it may inlarge Gods glory, before them who may be profited by preaching of his praise) and should be preferred to our own contentment for a time in heaven, so long as God pleaseth to take service of us here. For this is the force of the Prophets reasoning, <hi>In the grave who shal give thee thanks</hi>? Our place waiteth for us, and no man can take it over our head, while wee on earth are induring toy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and trouble, to bring more to heaven with us. 5. A true desire and purpose to glorifie God in this life, to the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying

of others, may give hope of some prolonging of life, and assurance of not perishing for ever: for <hi>Davids</hi> hope to be heard doth run here upon this ground. 7. The most la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, pressing, and piercing sorrow that ever soul felt, is from the sense of sinne, and of Gods displeasure for it, as the Prophets expression here doth give evidence. 8. The exercise of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under the sense of Gods displeasure, may be very heavy, and of long continuance; The prophet is <hi>weary with his groaning, &amp; his eyes consumed with grief.</hi> 9. No delay of comfort, no sense of sinne, no fear of Gods utter displeasure can be a reason to the believer to cease from prayer, and dealing with God for grace; for the Prophet is <hi>weary,</hi> but giveth not over; only his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is the matter of fresh mourning to him night and day, and powring out of tears in the Lords bosome: <hi>All the night maketh hee his bed to swim, and watereth his couch with his tears.</hi> 10. The insulting of enemies over the godly when the Lords hand is heavy upon them, because it reflecteth upon Religion and upon Gods glory, is a main ingredient in the sorrow of the godly: <hi>Davids</hi> eye had waxen <hi>old and dim with griefe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of all his enemies.</hi>

When our enemies are desperately malicious, and nothing can mitigate their fury; let the consideration of Gods justice mitigate our passion: <hi>for he wil arise in anger against them.</hi> 3. There is no lesse just zeale in God, to defend his owne oppressed people, then there is malice in the wicked, to wrong them: <hi>For his rising in anger,</hi> is here opposed <hi>to the rage of the enemies.</hi> 4. Albeit judgment against the oppressour be not at the first executed, yet God in his Word hath given out sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence against them, and in his active providence, hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared means and instruments for execution thereof in due time; <hi>When hee shall awake to execute the judgement which hee hath commanded,</hi> or given order for. 5. When the Lord ariseth to judge his enemies, then the Lords people will draw warmly unto him, and as it were, <hi>compasse him round about.</hi> 6. In calling for justice upon the wicked enemies of Gods people, wee should not be led with private passion, or desire of revenge, but with desire of Gods glory, and edification of his people: for their sakes prayeth he, <hi>return thou on high,</hi> or ascend to thy Tribunal Seat. 7. Principles of Religion, whereof we may have use in our exercises, should be solidly digested, that we may apply them readily to use, as neede re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, for strengthening of our faith, and prayer to God: for when the Prophet hath setled his faith upon the Doctrine

of <hi>Gods judging and executing justice in favours of his people,</hi> in the general, hee applyeth it to his own particular, saying, <hi>judge me O Lord.</hi> 8. When a man hath made peace with God about all his sins, upon the termes of grace and mercy, through the Sacrifice of the Mediatour, he may in comparison with his injurious enemies, in a particular cause, appeale to Gods justice to decide the controversie; as here the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet doth, saying, <hi>Iudge me according to my righteousnesse, O Lord, and mine integrity that is in me.</hi> 9. When a processe hath beene lying long before God, and the controversie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the godly and their persecuters is not yet decided, the godly may put in a bill for passing the decree, and executing of the sentence, as here is done: <hi>Oh let the wickednesse of the wicked come to an end, &amp;c.</hi> 10.

Creation and Providence, <hi>learn</hi> 1. The godly are not alwaies born downe with trouble; Sometime they have liberty to goe, and delight themselves in the beholding of Gods glory and goodnesse towards themselves, as the whole Psalme shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. 2. The mysterie of the glory of God, in his workes of Creation and Redemption, is such, as none save the eye spiritually illuminate by his spirit, can see it: And he that seeth it, cannot but be ravished therewith, when he doth dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne it; and none can sufficiently comprehend it, or take it up fully, save God himselfe. Therfore the Prophet direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his speech full of admiration, wholly to the Lord, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the Psalme. 3. The glory of the Lord is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sweetned unto the godly, in the time of their praising of his Majestie, when they consider their own Interest in him, as in their own <hi>propriety.</hi> Therefore saith he, <hi>O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name</hi>! 4. No words are sufficient to set out the glory of the Lord, not only as it is in it selfe, but even as it is discovered to a spirituall understanding; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by way of admiration, must he cry out, <hi>How excellent is thy Name</hi>! 5. The heavens and celestial lights shining from above, do speake much of Gods glory; but in effect his glory is greater then they can hold forth; <hi>for his glory is set above the heavens.</hi> 6. Albeit the glory of the Lord doth fill the world, yet hath he enemies of his glory, to wit, profane and godlesse persons, Athiests, Epicures, and persecuters of his people and truth; For here are <hi>enemies</hi> spoken of, and <hi>aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi> opening blasphemous mouths against him, and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as if God, and his people, had injured them. 7. Not only the providence of God in new borne babes, framing them in the belly, providing nourishment unto them when they are borne, and making them to suck the brests; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the giving of saving knowledge to some of them, in their tender years, is able to refute all Atheists and profane despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers of the glory of the Lord; <hi>for out of the mouth of babes and sucklings he hath ordained strength,</hi> or strong conviction, <hi>to still the enemie and the avenger,</hi> and put him to silence. <hi>Matthew</hi> 21.26.</p>

For when the prophet considereth the glorious hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens &amp;c. he asketh, <hi>What is man? &amp;c.</hi> 2.

               <p>In the third place, hee looketh on man considered in his Creation before the fall, and as he is in his head Christ (who is God incarnate, humbled and exalted for mans cause after the fall) restored to what hee lost by the fall. <hi>Whence learne,</hi> 1. Looke unto man in his creation, and God hath given him the place, in order of dignity, above all the creatures visible, next unto heavenly Angels: <hi>Thou hast made him a little lower then the Angels.</hi> 2. Looke unto man after his fall, restored by Christ unto his place, and in this respect hee is established in that dignity to be next unto the glorious Angels: <hi>Thou hast made him a little lower then the Angels.</hi> 3. Looke unto man in our Head Christ Jesus, God incarnate, and there man is wonderfully exalted in regard that for respect and love to man, the Man Christ being very God, is humbled unto the death of the crosse. And in this sense doth the Apostle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.7, 9. take this place, <hi>Thou madest him a little lower then the Angels, for the suffering of death.</hi> 4. Looke unto man in Christ Jesus, after his resurrection, and in his glorification; <hi>God hath crowned him with glory and Majestie.</hi> 5. It is no

small point of dignifying man, that all believers have by Christ this title of Heirship, with lawful use and possession of the creatures recovered and restored unto him: <hi>Thou ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest him to have dominion over the works of thine hands.</hi> 6. As there is nothing which may doe man good service, which God hath not granted man dominion over in and through Christ, so there is nothing can harm him, but he hath put under Christs feet, and under beleevers feet in and through Christ, to wit, sinne and Satan, and all our enemies, and Death the last ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; <hi>Hee hath put all things under his feete,</hi> as the Apostle ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.26. 7. Christ shall not lay downe his kingdome which he hath in his Church, and over all her ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, till hee hath put downe all rule and authority, and power against him and his Church, and have subdued all enemies under himselfe. <hi>For hee must reigne till hee hath put all things under his feete,</hi> as the Apostle collecteth, 1 Cor. 15.25. 8. Nothing is excepted or exeemed from being sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Christ, as man, no not the holy Angels (who are made ministring Spirits, to serve believers) but only God, essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially considered, he only is excepted. <hi>For he hath put all things under his feet; but when he saith all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted who did put all things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him,</hi> as the Apostle proveth from this place, 1 Cor. 15.27.</p>

It is not enough to have joy in our heart in the Lord, but it is his glory, that the joy which we have in him, be openly known as occasion offereth: therefore <hi>will David sing praises to the name of the Lord most high.</hi> 7. The way of giving God the glory in every action, and in special of our victories over our enemies, is to acknowledge him to bee the chief worker thereof, and the creatures to be but instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by whom hee turneth the enemie back: for <hi>the enemie falleth and perisheth at his presence.</hi> 8.

The ignorance of the Lords goodness, mercy, truth, and other his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, is the cause of making so little use of God in prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and so little believing in him in the time of trouble. <hi>For, they who know his name, will trust in him.</hi> 13.

               <p>In the third place, he exhorteth the rest of the godly to praise God with him. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. It is the duty of all believers to joyn themselves chearfully in the setting forth the Lords care over them, and whatsoever may make his lovely Majestie known to the world: for so requireth the present precept and example, <hi>Sing praises to the Lord.</hi> 2. The on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true God, and the right object of our joy and praises, is he who did manifest himself to the Church of the Jewes of old; who gave his Scriptures and his Ordinances to them; and among whom hee took up his residence in Jerusalem, <hi>in Sion,</hi> in the Temple, in the Mercy seat, betwixt the Cherubims, (which was a figure of the Incarnation of the Son of God; in whom, as the only Mediatour, is the trysting place betweene God and Believers, for accepting their persons and worship) for so doth the description of the true God here teach us: <hi>Sing praises to the Lord, who dwelleth in Sion.</hi> 3. The acts of the Lord for his people are so stamped with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of his divinity, that they are able to purchase glory to God even among the Nations that are without the Church, and to draw them to him: and so it is not a needlesse, fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse or hopelesse worke, to <hi>declare his doings among the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> 4. If the Lord be pleased to honour himselfe with the martyrdome of any of his servants, it is not for disrespect to their persons, for they remaine, even when dead, honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in his estimation, and high in his affection; for <hi>he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membereth them</hi> in a special manner. 5. There is a time appointed of God for bringing to judgment every sinne, and especially murther; and of all murthers, to avenge most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely the slaughter of his servants, concerning whom it is here said, <hi>When he maketh inquisition for blood, hee remembreth them:</hi> Precious in his eyes is the death of his Saints: 6. There is not a lost word in the earnest prayers of the humble belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, poured forth in the day of his necessity: every petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on shal have a ful answer, partly in this life, and partly in the life to come: For <hi>God forgetteth not the cry of the humble.</hi>

               <p>In the fourth place, hee cometh to his owne particular and present case, and prayeth for a new experience of the truth formerly set downe, believed and sealed by him. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. When new troubles befal experienced believers, they must betake them to their old refuge, and to the former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blessed means of prayer; as here <hi>David</hi> doth: <hi>Have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, O Lord, upon me.</hi> 2. Never a word of merit should be in the mouth of a true believer; For, <hi>Have mercy on mee, O Lord,</hi> is <hi>Davids</hi> onely plea; any good in us, is but a sandy ground to build on. 3. It sufficeth a believer acquainted with God, to present before God the trouble hee suffereth unjustly from his enemies, and to expect deliverance from the Lords grace towards himselfe, and from his justice in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the adversary: for this is the argument here used, <hi>Consider my trouble which I suffer of them that hate me.</hi> 4. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme danger of present death, should not dash nor discourage the believer to pray for deliverance, because experience hath proven, that the Lord <hi>can lift a believer up from the gates of death.</hi> 5. Life should not be loved so much for it selfe, as that wee may glorifie God in our life; and edifie others in the knowledge of God; For deliverance from death is here asked of God, that hee <hi>may set forth all the praises of God in the gates</hi> and most open places <hi>of the daughter of Sion</hi>: that is, in the audience of the people of God. 6. He gets a satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory Answer: which teacheth us, That in a moment the Lord can perswade the supplicant of the grant of his prayer, and fill him with joy; as here in one breath, ere the prophet could close his prayer, he is made to joy in the salvation or delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance which he was perswaded God was to give to him: <hi>I will rejoyce in thy salvation.</hi>

               <p>In the fifth place is set downe, how with confidence of his own delivery, he is made sure of the overthrow of the enemie: <hi>Whence learne,</hi> 1. Ordinarily, the delivery of the persecuted people of God is joyned with the overthrow of their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressors: And ceatainly, the wicked cannot take a readier way to ruine themselves, then to seek the overthrow of the Lords Church and people: For here, <hi>The heathen are sunke down in the pit that they made</hi>; and their crafty counsel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the godly, is the trap to take themselves into: <hi>In the net which they hid, their own feet are taken.</hi> 2. None of Gods judgments, and specially none of those Judgments whereby he pleads the cause of his Church against her enemies, should be lightly looked upon: <hi>For the Lord is known by the judgments which hee executeth</hi>: His judgements bear the impression of his wisdome and justice; so as the sinne may be read written on the rod. 3. Amongst other manifestations of Gods wisdome and justice in punishing his adversaries, this is one. The Lord makes the workes of the wicked, and specially what they doe against his people, to be the very means to undoe them: <hi>The wicked is snared in the work of his own hands.</hi> 4. As the devices of the wicked do come from hel, so do they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn thither, and draw the devisers with them: Though they cry, Peace, peace, and put the fear of hell farre from them, yet <hi>all the wicked shal be turned into hell.</hi> 5. As they who give themselves to sinne, and specially enemies to peace, doe cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the knowledge of God out of their mind and affections; so shall God cast them away far from his presence: <hi>All the nations that forget God, shall be turned into hell.</hi> 6. Albeit the Lord doe not presently execute judgment on the godlesse oppressors of his people, yet for respect the Lord doth beare to his people, their destruction shal certainly come: <hi>They shall goe down to bell; for the needy shall not alwayes bee forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</hi> The cry of the needy and oppressed shall bring judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

upon the oppressors. 7. The Lords people are an humbled people, afflicted, emptied, sensible of their need, driven to a dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attendance on God, daily begging of him, and living only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the hope of what is promised: for so are they here described needy, poor, supplicants, and expectants of the performance of what is promised. 8. Albeit the Lord seeme to lay aside the prayers of the oppressed godly, and forget them: and albeit the godly mans hope doth seem for a time vaine, <hi>yet shal he not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies be forgotten, nor his expectation perish for ever,</hi> and special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the expectation he hath of things everlasting, shal not be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed, but shal be satisfied <hi>for ever.</hi>

               <p>In the last place he followeth his condemnatory sentence of the wicked with prayer, that the Lord would put it in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, even in his owne time. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The Lord doth not so delay to execute judgement on the oppressors of his people, but he may be intreated to make speedy dispatch, and as need requireth <hi>to arise</hi> and fall to worke. 2. The time of Gods arising is, when the cause of God which the godly do mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine is like to be lost. <hi>Arise, O Lord, let not man prevail.</hi> There is his reason, why he would have God to arise. 3. When God ariseth for the godly, he maketh it appear, that they are his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and that their adversaries are in effect before him but hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and strangers from the inward covenant, and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of his people, whether they be within the visible Church or not; for he prayeth, <hi>Let the heathen be judged in thy sight.</hi> 4.

Atheisme in the wicked, the more wee should draw neere to God: and albeit the godly conceive God to lye off, and sit stil from executing of justice; the godly being tempted with the tentations which overcome the wicked, yet they must not yeeld to the tentation, but pray against it, as here is done, <hi>Arise, O Lord, lift up thy hand.</hi> 2. The merciful respect and love which the Lord hath to his afflicted people, wil not suffer his justice against these persecuters, to be long quiet, <hi>For he will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the humble.</hi> 3. As the Interest which God hath in his owne people, doth engage him to fal on their enemies; so the vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication also of his own glory from the contempt which they doe to his Name, doth ingage him against them; for <hi>wherefore doth the wicked contemne God, &amp;c?</hi> 4. The godlesse enemies of Gods people doe deny Gods providence, and deny Gods ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, yet his people are comforted under their saddest sufferings by the Lords seeing and marking thereof; for the godly say here, <hi>Thou hast seene it, and beholdest mischiefe.</hi> 5. Gods judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the wicked shall really refute the Atheisme of the wicked, and requite their opposition made to the godly. <hi>He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds mischiefe and spite to requite it with his hand.</hi> 6. When a man hath laid forth his desires, and poured out his heart before God, he should quiet himselfe, and cast himselfe with his bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den upon the Lord; for here <hi>the poor committeth himselfe to God.</hi> And when an humble believer hath casten his burden on the Lord, the Lord wil not faile to take care of what hee is trusted with, it is an engaging of God, that the poor hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted himself to him. 7. As the Lords Office, Custome, and Nature is, so is his real work to do for them who imploy him, and are not able to do for themselves; <hi>Hee is the helper of the fatherlesse.</hi> 8. The power of persecuters cannot be so great, but God shal weaken and break it, so as they shall not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to trouble his people. <hi>Breake thou the arme of the wicked.</hi> 9. Though the Lord reckons not with his enemies for their sins at first, yet he reckons for all at last; for lesse and for greater, for one and for all, and doth not passe a farthing of the debt of punishment un-exacted: <hi>But seeketh out their sinnes till hee find none.</hi> O how fearful a reckoning must it be, which the Lord maketh with the impenitent, who die unpardoned, and unreconciled with God, through the Mediator Christ Jesus!</p>

               <p>In the last place, the answer of the petition followeth, in a comfortable perswasion of the supplicant, concerning the grant thereof: <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. That the prayer of the persecuted shall not be rejected, because the kingdome of Christ in his Church is perpetual: earthly Kings cannot live still to helpe their friends, followers, or flatterers, or to persecute and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest Gods Church: But <hi>Christ is the Lord and King for ever and ever,</hi> to defend his people, and punish his foes. 2. The wicked within the visible Church, howsoever they have the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal priviledges of Gods people, yet if they continue unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, and do oppose piety, they shal be in Gods estimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and in the day of his judging of them, counted, as they are here called, heathen, and shal be separate from the fellowship of God and Gods people, <hi>The heathen shall perish out of his land.</hi> 3. Its the Lords way to exercise his children with trouble, till hee humble them, and make them sensible of the neede of his help, til he turn their sense of need, into a desire of his reliefe, and their desire into a prayer, and then hee will in due time give answer: <hi>Lord, thou hast heard the desire of the humble.</hi> 4. Grace to pray, and the fixing of the heart in prayer on the Lord, is his gift, no lesse then the answer of the prayer: and where the Lord doth give the one grace, he wil also give the other: <hi>Thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear.</hi> 5. When God beginneth to shew his respect to the prayers of his people against their oppressors, then the helplesse and weake servants of God shal have deliverance from the power of oppressours, and their oppressours shal not be able to do any more harme, when the Lord causeth his ear to hear their prayer: <hi>the fatherlesse shal be judged,</hi> yea declared righteous, absolved and delivered; <hi>and the oppressour shall no more oppresse.</hi> 6. If there were no more comfort to the godly opressed, yet this may suffice, that their life, inheritance, and happinesse is in heaven; and that their oppressours, in opposition to them are declared here, to be <hi>but men of this earth,</hi> whose portion is no better, then what they have here in this World.</p>

               <p>BEfore the Prophet dispute, and produce his reasons against the tentations unto unbeliefe, he asserteth and avoweth his faith, and presenteth the danger he is in, before God. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Its the surest method in our spiritual combate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Sathan, and his fiery darts, to hold up the shield of faith, and to fix our self in resolution never to loose our gripes off the Lord; As <hi>David doth here, In the Lord put I my trust.</hi> 2.

               </q>
               <p>In the next place, he disputeth for the confirmation of his own faith by sundry reasons or severall considerations. The first reason to confirme his faith, is from the absurdity of the tentation, tending to the overturning of the very foundation of religion, whereunto, if the believer should yield, he is lost and gone. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Faith in God, and flying to him in all straits for relief, is the <hi>foundation</hi> of all religious and righteous persons, whereupon they build their hope and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse solidly; for <hi>David</hi> had laid it for a foundation, that God <hi>was a Rock,</hi> or mountaine of refuge for men to flee unto in straits. 2. A tentation to mistrust God, and not to flee to him in all hazards, is most dangerous, and destructive of all true Religion, for it is the destroying of the very foundations of righteousnesse and happinesse; and the resisting of this ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is so necessary, as in what measure it is yielded unto, in that measure the righteous man is put to a stand, and to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortlesse perplexity, and should despair certainly if he went from it. <hi>For if the foundations be destroyed, what shall the righteous man do?</hi> If it be in vaine to flie to God, righteous men are lost men, which is absurd.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:41635:35"/>The next reason to confirme his faith is the establishment of a Mediatour, set forth in the Word of God, and other holy ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, concerning the covenant of grace, and the benefits of it, and duties required in it, all to be found in the Lords holy temple, or Tabernacle, representing Christ Jesus and his Church, and the mutual relations betweene God and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. <hi>Whence learne,</hi> 3. The way to refresh and strengthen faith, is to looke to God in Christ the Mediator, reconciling the World to himself, according as he was shadowed forth in the Temple of Jerusalem, and as he is stil holden forth in the Church, in his word and other ordinances. First and last Christ is the trysting place, where God is constantly to be found on his mercy seat; for <hi>the Lord in his holy Temple,</hi> did speake so much to the Church in typical terms.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The third reason is, because God is a perfect judg to take order in due time, both with them who oppose his worke and people, and with those who wil not make use of his mercy. <hi>The Lords throne is in heaven.</hi> 5. The Lords knowledge of all mens carriage is perfect: <hi>His eyes behold.</hi> 6. When the Lord doth not make manifest by his work that he seeth mens carriage, but seemeth, as it were, to wink and close his eyes, he is then about to try the hearts of men, and to bring their thoughts to light. <hi>His eye-lids</hi> (when eyes seem closed) <hi>do try the children of men.</hi> 7. The troubles whereunto the Lord doth put his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in times of tentation, are not to be exponed as acts of displeasure, or meer justice, but as acts of wisdome and love, to try, exercise, and frame them to obedience. <hi>The Lord tryeth the righteous</hi>; at such times as he sendeth trouble specially. 8. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he giveth the wicked and violent persecuter to have a seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prosperity, while the godly are in trouble, yet that is no act of love to them: for <hi>the wicked, and him that loveth violence, his soul hateth.</hi> 9. All the seeming advantages which the wicked have in their owne prosperity, are but meanes of hardening of them in their ill course, and holding them fast in the bonds of their own iniquities, till God execute judgement on them. <hi>Upon the wicked he shall raine snares.</hi> 10. Whatsoever be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the wicked for a time, yet at length suddaine, terrible, irresistible, and remedilesse destruction they shal not escape: <hi>fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest is the portion of their cup.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 4. reason for confirmation of his faith is from the Lords love, setled upon his upright servants, in the midst of their troubles, while they suffer for righteousnesse sake. <hi>Whence learne,</hi>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:41635:35"/>

friendly counsel, turneth himself to God. <hi>Whence learne,</hi> 1. The face of the visible Church may sometime be so far defaced, that there cannot be a man found to show himself openly, for a good cause, as here is noted. <hi>The godly man ceaseth, the faithfull fail from among the children of men.</hi> 2.

When ungodly men intend most to deceive, then they are sure to speak fairest, giving pleasant words, with insinuation of respects in abundant complements.

Vain talk, cousening speeches, flattering words, are unbeseeming honest men, and do argue in so far as men affect them, ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, unfaithfulnesse, and deceitfulnesse in a man; for <hi>when with flattering lips they speak, with a double heart they speak.</hi>

Although pick-thankes, and flatterers of great men, in prejudice of the godly, do hope to stand by their flatterie, yet <hi>the Lord shall cut off all flattering lips.</hi> 2. Albeit men in power and place do threaten to bring about great things against Gods people, yet they shall not bee able to doe what they have said, <hi>for God shall cut off also the tongue that speaketh proud things.</hi>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:41635:36"/>
3. Wicked men are confident, and do assure themselves to dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble out their course by their falshood, flattery, and calumnies against the godly; <hi>They have said, With our tongue wil we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail.</hi> 4. Wicked men make no conscience to use well the gifts which they have gotten of God; such as are wit, or language, or any other thing; for they say, <hi>Our lips are our owne.</hi> 5. Wicked men stand not in awe of God; they fear not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment from him, for in effect they say; <hi>Who is Lord over us?</hi> But we must learn from their faults three contrary lessons; to wit, 1. That nothing which we have is our own. But 2. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is given to us of God is for service to be done to him. 3. That whatsoever we do, or say, we have a Lord over us, to whom we must be answerable, when he calleth us to accounts.</p>

                     <hi>6.</hi> The words of the Lord <hi>are</hi> pure words: <hi>as</hi> sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver tryed in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.</p>

               </q>
               <p>The second comfort of the godly in an ill time, is from the promise of God, to deliver the godly out of the hand of the wicked. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. When the Lord hath exercised the Godly for a while, with the oppression of the wicked, he will not fail to make manifest, that he hath heard their sad supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and seen their oppression; <hi>for the oppression of the poor, for the fighting of the needy, now will I arise, saith the Lord.</hi> 2. The proud persecuter doth think little of the Godly, or any power that can defend him, but doth mock the hope he hath to be helped; yet <hi>God will set the godly in safety from him that puffeth at him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This promise the Prophet commendeth to the Church, as a precious truth, which will be found forth-coming to the full, in experience. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 3. To the end that the word of promise may be comfortable to us, till new experience comes, we must consider whose word it is, and that there is no vanity in promises, but all contained in them, shall be found very solid, like the refined silver, or gold, which is purged from all drosse, and the oftner it is put in the fire, it is the more fair, and of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter value: for <hi>the words are the Lords words, and pure words,</hi> tryed,

true his experience, <hi>as silver tryed in a furnace of earth seven times,</hi> and clear from all drosse.</p>

If the Lord think it not good to give an outward delivery, faith will be content of a blenk of Gods countenance for the present, <hi>lighten mine eyes,</hi> saith he; that is, let me have some immediate comfort to uphold me in the hope of my delivery. 4. Its a death to the godly man who hath seen him that is invisible, to be long without the sense of Gods love; sense of succumbing and perishing in trouble, doth in this case usually set upon the Godly, as here, <hi>lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death.</hi> 5.

Every man so long as he lyeth unrenewed, and unreconciled unto God (how wise so ever, or of how great parts so ever he may seem to be to himself or the world) is nothing in effect but a mad man, running to his own destruction in losing his soul and eternall life, when he seemeth most to gain the world, therefore he is called <hi>the fool.</hi> 2.

That the nature of all unrenewed men, is to bear deadly enmity against those that are really Gods people, and delight to undo the godly, as contemners of all that live not as they do. <hi>They eat up my people as they do bread,</hi> saith the Lord. 2. The Lord owns the quarrell, and wrongs done to the godly, as done to him, in whomsoever his image is hated or persecuted. <hi>They eat up my people,</hi> saith he. 3. The causelesse hatred of the godly is a most unreasonable thing, and argueth admirable stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity in wicked men, who maligne the innocent, by whose life they are admonished of their duty, and taught the way to felicity. <hi>Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge?</hi> 4.

not reconciled to God, <hi>For to be workers of iniquity, and eaters up of Gods people as bread, and not calling on God,</hi> are put for the marks and properties of the same sort of ungodly men.</p>
               <p>Upon the challenge of the ungodly, the Prophet inferreth the consequence of certain and sad judgements to follow on the wicked, because God is nearly concerned in the quarrell of his people. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 5. The persecution of piety in the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, provoketh God to inflict the most fearfull, and most suddain judgements. <hi>For therein specially were the ungodly put to fear, where they had no fear at all.</hi> 6. The near conjunction which God hath with the godly, is the reason of the greatnesse of the sin of persecution of them for godlinesse: for here it is given for a reason, why <hi>there</hi> they were in fear, why they were to tremble when God came to avenge the oppression of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which the wicked feared never to be questioned; <hi>Because God is in the generation of the righteous.</hi> 7.

Christ is the salvation of <hi>Sion,</hi> both figuratively and properly called so, as well before he came, as after; for here he is looked on as the <hi>Salvation of Israel,</hi> in whom all our salvation, <hi>Iewes</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> is founded. 2.

                  <p>The Prophet for distinguishing of the true members of the Church from those who were only out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly professors, asketh of the Lord, how the one may be known from the other? ver. 1. and receiveth answer to the question, ver. 2, 3, 4, 5.</p>

               <p>THe question is proponed about the marks of the sincere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, the true Covenanters with God, the true Professors of true religion, who they are who shall not be cast out from the society of Gods true Church. <hi>Whence learne,</hi> 1. The Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle pitched by <hi>Moses,</hi> and the hill of <hi>Sion,</hi> where the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle

and the Temple wat at last setled, was a Type of the true Church, and of Communion with God in Christ the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour, a type of God incarnate, dwelling, and exercising all his offices in his Church, and of the heavenly condition of his people called out of the world, and lifted up toward him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed under the name of Gods Tabernacle, and Gods holy hill. 2. Some of those who professe to be of this fellowship may be thrust out from it again, and debarred from all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, when other some shall remaine in this state, and not be removed. For the question is moved, What are the marks of the members of the Church invisible? and who they are <hi>who shal abide in Gods tabernacle, and dwel in his holy hill</hi>? 3. Only the Lord who searcheth the heart, can put the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene the true and the false; for this cause the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is proponed to God, <hi>Lord, who shall abide in thy Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle?</hi>

               <p>The Lord answereth in the rest of the Psalme, by shewing the fruits of faith manifested in obedience to Gods commands, both moral and judicial, in the sight of all men: The since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of which faith and truth was to be certainly knowne to God only, and to the conscience of every mans self; which was sufficient to satisfie the question, quieting and comforting of the upright ones. <hi>Whence learne,</hi> 1. That sincere indeavour of universal obedience in a mans conversation, is a fruit and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of true faith, and a mark of a true member of the Church invisible, <hi>He walketh uprightly, and doth righteousnesse.</hi> 2. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fruit of true faith, is conscience-making of what a man spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, ruling his tongue so, as his heart and his tongue do agree
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:41635:42"/>
in the truth: <hi>he speaketh the truth from the heart.</hi> 3. A third fruit of unfained faith, is making conscience in all his dealings, that he harm not his neighbour, neither in his name, nor in his person, nor his goods, and making conscience not to receive readily a false report of his neighbour, when it is devised by another, <hi>Hee backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doth evil to his neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour.</hi> 4. A fourth fruit of sound faith, is the low estimation of any wordly excellency wherewith a wicked man can be busked; to whom, although the godly, according to duty, will give civil honour, as his place requireth, yet hee counteth him a poor miserable man for all his honour and wealth, because hee walketh in a godlesse way: but where he seeth one that feareth God, he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemeth highly of him in his heart, whatsoever externall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions thereof hee find fit to give, because of the honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble way of holinesse, wherein the godly walketh; <hi>for in his eyes a vile person is contemned, but he honoureth him that feareth the Lord.</hi> 5. A fifth fruit of sound faith, is tender respect to the Name of God, and care to keep lawful promises, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, and oathes, whatsoever civil inconveniences may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low upon the strict keeping of them; <hi>Though he swear to his owne damage, he changeth not.</hi> 6. A sixth fruit and evidence of faith, is dispensing with commodity, when God by a speciall reason calleth for so doing, albeit other wayes a man might take rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably more gaine. Many of such sort of cases do occurre in merchandise, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

7. The seventh fruit and evidence of faith, is freedome from briberie, with love of justice, which the believer wil not pervert, to the detriment of the man who hath a good cause, for whatsoever bud or reward man can give him. This is the upright mans last property, <hi>He taketh not a reward against the innocent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having numbred out the evidences of a sound convert and true believer, who shal never be thrust out of Gods fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship, he concludeth, <hi>That whosoever doth these things,</hi> or studieth to do them, <hi>shall never be moved.</hi> That is, hee that shal evidence his faith in God, by a sincere indeavour to doe the duties of the first and second table of Gods Law, shall not be removed from Gods house, but shall abide in his Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, and dwell in Sion, in the fellowship of God and his Saints for ever.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>David</hi> in this Psalm, finding himself in the state of grace, prayeth for preservation in general, in relation unto all dangers, and evils of body and soul, and whatsoever other evill, from which a godly man, with allowance of Gods word might pray to be preserved. His only reason to assure himself to be heard, is because he had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten grace to trust in God. The sincerity of which faith in God, he proveth by sundry evidences, ver. 1, 2, 3, 4. In the second place he climbeth up to the comfort and joy of believing; And all the grounds of joy whereupon he goeth, do serve both to confirme his faith, and to give him assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the granting of his prayer, ver. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.</p>
               </argument>
               <q>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:41635:43"/>
                  <hi>Ver. 1.</hi> PReserve me, O GOD: for in thee do I put my trust.</q>
               <p>HE findeth himself in a good condition, and all the prayers he prayeth, is in one word, for preservation. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. As our being, living, and moving natural, and our bringing into the spiritual and blessed estate of grace, is of the Lord, so is our keeping therein of the Lord also, and our duty is to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg God in both, and to live unto, and pray for his upholding of us, and not to leane upon our owne wisdome, strength, or holinesse; For <hi>David</hi> teacheth so to doe. <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve me, O God.</hi> 2. The grace of God having granted to us lively faith, setled on God, is a sufficient ground of our hope, and assurance to persevere, and to be still preserved, for this is the reason whereby <hi>David</hi> confirmeth his prayer, <hi>For in thee doe I put my trust.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver. 2. O my soul,</hi> thou hast said unto the Lord, Thou <hi>art</hi> my Lord: my goodnesse <hi>extendeth</hi> not to thee:</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <hi>3. But</hi> to the saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in whom <hi>is</hi> all my delight.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Because he hath made his faith in God, the reason of his hope of perseverance, and of his having his prayer granted, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the sincerity of his faith by five Evidences or fruits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The first solid evidence of the sincerity of saving Faith, is the testimony of the conscience, bearing witnesse to a man, that he hath layd hold on the covenant of grace, and hath chosen God for his protectour, and master, and that he is resolved to depend upon God, and to serve him, as <hi>David</hi> did, saying, <hi>O my soul, thou hast said unto the Lord, thou art my Lord.</hi> 2. Another evidence of the sincerity of faith, is renunciation of all confidence in a mans owne works, and the rejecting of all conceit of any possibility of merit at Gods hand, who cannot be profited by our goodnesse; for we have what we have of him, and can never put an obligation on him by any thing which we can doe. <hi>My goodnesse doth not extend to thee.</hi> 3. A third fruit and evidence of faith, is love and kindnesse to the godly, and bestowing of our own goods for supplying their need, joyned with a high estimation of their preciousnesse, above the godlesse world, and with pleasure ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in their fellowship: so reckoneth the prophet, saying, <hi>My
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:41635:43"/>
goodnesse extendeth not to thee, but to the Saints that are on the earth, and to the excellent, in whom is all my delight</hi>: where, by the way, let us observe, He knew no saints to whom he could be profitable, save only the Saints who are <hi>upon the earth.</hi>

                  <hi>Ver. 4.</hi> Their sorrowes shal be multiplied, <hi>that</hi> hasten <hi>after</hi> another <hi>god:</hi> their drink-offerings of bloud will I not offer, nor take up their names into my lips.</q>
               <p>A fourth fruit and evidence of faith, is, the hating of false religion, and counting all followers of idolatry, or worship of another god, then the true God, to be accursed; such a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of false religion as is accompanied with the discountenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, open discrediting, and abhorring of all idol service, as <hi>David</hi> expresseth here in the whole <hi>verse. Whence learne,</hi> 1. Men as they are naturally averse from following the true God, and the true religion; so are they naturally bent to all idolatry, and zealous in following idols, and any false religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>They hasten after another god..</hi> 2. The more men do hasten after felicity, in the way of idolatry, they have the worse speede. For <hi>their sorrowes shall be multiplied that hasten after another God.</hi> 3. The more madly the world runne after idolatry, the more should the faithful man testifie his abominating thereof, as <hi>David</hi> doth. <hi>Their drink-offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their names into my lips.</hi> He cannot speak of them without disdaine.</p>

                  <hi>Ver. 5.</hi> The Lord <hi>is</hi> the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou maintainest my lot.</q>
               <p>A fifth fruit and evidence of faith in God, is delight, and satisfaction in, and resting on God, as all-sufficient for the believers compleat happinesse, as the whole verse holdeth forth. <hi>Whence learne,</hi> 1. The believer hath as sure right unto God, as any man hath to the patrimony whereunto he is born; or any Tribe ever had to his share in the Land of <hi>Canaan.

                     </gap> Lord is the portion of his inheritance.</hi> 2. The Lord is the believers lot and share<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> when the world are seeking, some one, some another temporal good; <hi>The Lord, and the light of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,</hi> is the believers compleat good; whatsoever measure of earthly things is given to the godly beside, <hi>Levi's</hi> portion is his portion. <hi>The Lord is the portion of his inheritance.</hi> 3. The Lord is the believers livelihood, and the furnisher of his daily bread, <hi>He is the portion of his cup.</hi> 4. The Lord giveth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:41635:44"/>
to the believer for his felicity, as he also maintaineth the believer in the right unto, and possession of himself: <hi>Hee main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth his lot</hi>: and so, as the believer cometh to his right he hath unto God, not by his owne purchase, but by spirituall birth-right, as a child of Christ by faith, or by free donation of this inheritance, received of God by faith; so he may claim to God, and enjoy the possession of God, as <hi>firmly</hi> as his <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance</hi>; as <hi>fully</hi> as if God were his particular <hi>property</hi> and portion; as <hi>sweetly</hi> as his daily food, and the portion of his domestick <hi>cup</hi>: and with as great <hi>quietnesse and security,</hi> as the immediate vassal of the mightiest Monarch, being willing, able, and ingaged most deeply <hi>to maintain his lot.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Ver. 6.</hi> The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant <hi>pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;</hi> yea, I have goodly heritage.</q>
               <p>In the second place he climbeth up to the joy of faith, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing from the certaine perswasion, and present sense of his being in the state of grace; The reasons or grounds of his joy are six, The first reason of his joy, is founded upon the properties and self-sufficiency of God, compared to a <hi>goodly and pleasant heritage,</hi> which wanteth no commodity within it self. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Pleasure and profit, and all commodities of life are abundantly to be found in God; &amp; whatsoever can be represented by any goodly heritage, lying in most pleasant places, is but a sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of what is to be found in him, as the comparison taken from lower things here importeth. 2. The more the believer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidereth what the Lord is, and what are his perfections, and what is the believers own interest in God, the more is he satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and ravished in the beholding of God, and his owne feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city in him. No wonder therefore if <hi>David</hi> say, for the measu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring out of this share to him, <hi>that his lines are fallen out to him in pleasant places, &amp;c.</hi> 3. The believer hath liberty to appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate God in a manner to himselfe, and in comparison with the share of the worldlings, to preferre his own portion above all ot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>rs: This doth <hi>David,</hi> when he calleth God his <hi>own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant places, and his own heritage.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Ver. 7.</hi> I will blesse the Lord who hath given me counsel: my reins also instruct me in the night season.</q>
               <p>The second reason and ground of joy, is because God hath perswaded him to believe in the <hi>Messiah,</hi> or <hi>Christ</hi> to come, as is clear by the next <hi>verse,</hi> and that God has taken the directing of him<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 
                  <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. As it is the work of God only, to
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:41635:44"/>
give effectuall counsel to any man to believe in Christ; So also the way of perswasion of a soul to trust in God, is a way of working, proper onely to God; for it maketh the man so free an agent, in the act of believing, as if Gods work were coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel only, and the work of active perswasion so invincible, as the work is effectually wrought, and infallibly: for he calleth the bestowing of saving faith, or grace to consent to the covenant of grace, a <hi>giving counsel: He hath given me counsel.</hi> 2. The glory of trusting in God, is not a matter of gloriation of the believer, in his own disposing of himself, but a matter of thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving to God, and glorifying of him, who giveth the counsel to believe, and maketh the counsel to him effectual: For <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> saith, <hi>I will blesse the Lord who hath given me counsel,</hi> to wit, effectually; for faith is not of our selfe, it is the gift of God, wherein flexanimous power and voluntary consent are sweetly joyned together. 3. This mercy of powerfully perswading a soul to make choice of God, to close in covenant with him, and to trust in him, doth put a perpetuall obligation of thanksgiving unto God upon the believer, to make him say in all time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and for ever, <hi>I will blesse the Lord, who hath given me coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel.</hi> 4. With the gift of saving faith, or perswasive counsel to believe in God, is joyned the sweet guiding and directing of the Lords Spirit, how to order the wayes of the believer: For here instruction of him in the night season, is joyned with the former mercy, and is made a reason of thanksgiving, and blessing of God. For he addeth, <hi>My reins also shall instruct me in the night season.</hi> 5. The framing of the will, desire, appetite, affections, inclinations, thoughts, and secret meditations, is so inward, secret and deep a work, as the Spirit of God thinks good to expresse this his giving discretion secretly to <hi>David,</hi> in the terms of the <hi>teaching of the reins,</hi> because they are the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest parts of the body, and nearest to the back of any of the inward noble parts; and because of the nature of the reins, which have much affinity with the affections, and have for their office the discretive purging of the blood, the natural fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture of life, <hi>My reins also instruct me in the night season.</hi>

               <p>The third reason, and ground of joy, is the gift of the grace of God, making him alwayes keep his eye (for getting as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, direction, and comfort) to good purpose, upon Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, the Lord, of whom this place is exponed <hi>Act.</hi> 2.25.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:41635:45"/>
                  <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The duty of the believer, and the way for him to have and retain joy in the Lord, is to fix the eye of faith alwaies, in all estates, on the Mediator, the promised Messiah, the Lord Jesus, for direction, assistance, comfort, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery. For this was <hi>Davids</hi> way, <hi>I have set the Lord alway before my face.</hi> 2. Such as implore Jesus Christ for all things in all estates, shall be sure to have his effectuall presence neer hand to help him in time of need. For <hi>he is at such a mans right hand, at all times.</hi> 3. Faith, kept in excercise by em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying of Jesus Christ, may have assurance of perseverance, and enjoying constantly the state of grace: what-ever alterations, and commotions come, their state shall stand fixed; they shall stand in grace; for upon this ground the Prophet saith, <hi>I shall never be moved.</hi>

               <q>
                  <hi>Ver. 9.</hi> Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoyceth; my flesh also shall rest in hope.</q>
               <p>A fourth reason of joy abounding in his heart, and breaking forth in his words, is his victory over death, and the grave, by faith in Jesus Christ. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Faith in Christ is able not only to give peace that passeth understanding, but also to fill the heart with joy, and to make the tongue, which is a mans glory, above all other creatures, sometime to break forth in expressions of joy; for <hi>therefore</hi> saith he, <hi>my heart is glad, and my glory rejoyceth.</hi> 2. So great victory over death and the grave, is gotten by faith in Jesus Christ, that a believer can lay down his body in the grave, as in a bed, to rest it there, in hope of the resurrection; and here an instance and example for it. <hi>My flesh also shall rest in hope.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Ver. 10.</hi> For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine holy One to see corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</q>
               <p>The first reason of his joy, is the assurance of the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Jesus Christ his head, through whom he hopeth to be raised in his own order and time. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. A believer is so nearly joyned with Christ, that he may give to him the styles of what is nearest and dearest to him, and call him his very <hi>life</hi> and <hi>soul,</hi> as here David saith of Christ, who behoved to rise again, Act. 2.25. <hi>Thou wilt not leave my soul,</hi> or my life <hi>in grave</hi>: and by this means he also is assured of his own resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection in due time; for our life and soul is bound up in Christ: Our life is hid with God in Christ, specially in respect

               </q>
               <p>The first part of the prayer is unto God, as a righteous Judge, to hear his plaint, and to decide in his favour, according to his just cause, and righteous carriage in relation to his enemies: <hi>Whence learne,</hi> 1. As righteous men are subject unto inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and oppressions, as well as others are, and are driven by trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to seek relief of God, as, in this case; it is a speciall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, to have <hi>God a righteous judge</hi> to hear them, and a righteous <hi>cause</hi> to bring before him, that the man may say, <hi>Hear the right, O Lord.</hi> 2. The conscience of earnest and honest dealing with God, in the singlenesse of our heart in prayer, is a good reason to helpe our faith in prayer, when wee may say, <hi>We cry, and pray, not with feigned lips.</hi> 3. When wee are unjustly condemned by men, we may appeale to God, and call the appellation, and seek and expect a more just sentence pronounced and executed by God. We may say, <hi>Let my sentence come forth from thy presence.</hi> 4 Although men cast out our true defences, which we make against false Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, and doe not respect equity; yet God will take notice of the whole processe <hi>his eyes will behold things that are equal.</hi> 2. Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of heart giveth boldnesse to a man to present himselfe to God, to be examined, after that the conscience in its private tryall of the mans carriage toward the adversary, hath in the sight of God absolved him; as here the Prophet, in relation to his carriage toward the oppressor, doth speak to God, <hi>

Sincerity of carriage for time by-past, must be joyned with a purpose of sincerity in time coming, that he may say with <hi>David,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to his part, <hi>I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgresse</hi>; that is, not to speak a wrong word against him. 7. Naturall mens manner of dealing, when they are injured, is to recompense evill for evill. For <hi>the works of men</hi> are to follow <hi>the paths of the destroyer.</hi> 8. There is no way to keep the children of God from these paths of the destroyer, when they are provoked to injuries, except in the fear of God, they look to what Gods word directeth them to doe. Thus did <hi>David</hi> escape an ill course, when his nature might have tempted him to it. <hi>By the words of thy lips have I kept me from the paths of the destroyer.</hi>

               <p>The second part of the prayer, wherein he requesteth for grace to be kept still in a righteous and holy way; <hi>Whence learne,</hi> 1. The most holy man, though he have stood fast formerly, is most feared to offend, and most suspicious of himselfe, and most ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest with God to be holden up, that he fall not in time to come; and giveth all the glory of his standing in a good cause, unto God, as is evidently holden forth in this petition of <hi>David, Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not.</hi> 2. The best way to have deliverance from, and victory over adversaries, is to keep a straight course of carriage in the fear of God, <hi>Going in Gods paths,</hi> that is, as God hath prescribed our way in his word. 3.

               </q>
               <p>The third part of his prayer, is, for a mercifull protection, and preservation from his enemies. <hi>Whence learne,</hi> 1. The Beleever must hold his eye in time of dangers and straits, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially upon Gods good will and kindnesse, as a counter-ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of all the malice of men: and here, though his straits were never so great, he shall read a possibility of wonders for his deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, as here is seen; <hi>Shew thy marvellous loving kindnesse, O Lord.</hi> Beside common favors, God hath other mercies in keeping for his own, and those are marked even with some wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, either in the time, or manner, or measure, or mean, or some other respect. 2. The Lords power and his office of Saviourship, and his constant manner of dealing for beleevers, are the pillars of the perswasion of help to be had in God. So reasons <hi>David,</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>O thou that savest with thy right hand them which put their trust in thee</hi>: for Gods Nature, Christs Office, and his manner of dealing, are equivalent to promises, when they are looked unto by a beleever. 3. Such as trouble unjustly them, of whom the Lord hath taken the maintenance, do in a sort engage God to be their, party, and to defend his servants, <hi>for they rise up against</hi> not only Gods servants, but against <hi>God, who saveth by his right hand.</hi> 4. The care God hath of his poor children, that depend upon him, is unspeakable; and the tender love he beareth unto them, no one similitude can expresse, as plurality of similitudes joyned here, doe give evidence; for Gods care of them is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to mans care <hi>of the apple of his eye</hi>; Gods love to them is comparable to the love of the <hi>Bird-mother</hi> toward her young ones, whom she warmeth, and <hi>hideth under the shadow of her wings.</hi> O wonderfull goodnesse, and wisedom of God, who admitteth himselfe to be compared to such low similitudes, that he might lift up our faith above all objections of mis-belief.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver. 9.</hi> From the wicked that oppresse me, <hi>from</hi> my daily enemies, <hi>who</hi> compasse me about.</p>

                     <hi>10.</hi> They are enclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they speak proudly.</p>

               </q>
               <p>The reason of his prayer, is taken from the deadly malice of his enemies, <hi>v.</hi> 9. from their pride, <hi>v.</hi> 10. from their confidence, <hi>v.</hi> 11. from their beastly cruelty, <hi>v.</hi> 12. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Gods people are ordinarily wicked, oppressors, deadly enemies to them, proud of their wealth and power, boasters, crafty Foxes, cruel Lions: and the more of these evils doe break forth against Gods people, the more should the dangers be layd before God; not for information of him, but for the exone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of our griefs, tentations, fears and dangers before God, and laying of our care upon him: and so much the more also is vengeance on the enemie, and the delivery of the godly near hand; and hopes of answering the prayers put up against them, are the more made certain, as the use of the wickednesse of the enemy made by the Prophet here doth teach.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver. 13.</hi> Arise, O Lord, disappoint him, cast him down: deliver my soul from the wicked <hi>which is</hi> thy Sword:</p>
                  <p n="14">
                     <hi>14</hi> From men <hi>which are</hi> thy hand, O Lord, from men of the world, <hi>which have</hi> their portion in <hi>this</hi> life, and whose belly thou fillest with thy hid <hi>treasure</hi>: they are ful of children, and leave the rest of their <hi>substance</hi> to their babes.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The Fourth part of the prayer is, for frustrating the intention of the enemy, and setting the supplicant free from the danger. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. When danger is most nigh, God is more nigh, and he can shortly interpose himself, to the overturning of the designe of the enemy, and to the ruine of the enemy him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: he can quickly <hi>arise, and disappoint him, and cast him down.</hi> 2. The power of the enemy standeth in the Lords imploying of him; he cannot strike, except God strike by him; therefore he is called <hi>Gods sword.</hi> 3. The shortest way to be safe from what the wicked can doe, is prayer to God, to over-rule him. Therefore saith <hi>David, Deliver my soul from the wicked, which is thy sword.</hi> 4. The Lord ordinarily for execution of wrath, and for hard tryals, and troubles of the godly, doth in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence make use of the wicked; <hi>Deliver me,</hi> saith he, <hi>from men which are thy hand.</hi> 5. The wicked neither have, nor doe seek any felicity, but what may be had in this life, <hi>they are men of this
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:41635:48"/>
world, and have their portion in this life,</hi> they need look for no more good then they finde in the world, and that is, <hi>a poor,</hi> and sorry happinesse. 6. The belly full of sensuall lust, and rarest dishes, and best meats which Gods store-house can afford, is the height of the happinesse of a poor rich worlding. In his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, it is all that God giveth him for his portion, and which the Fool hath chosen, even the <hi>filling of his belly with Gods hid trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,</hi> or of some rare meat, which meaner people cannot have, and therefore it is called <hi>Gods hid treasure.</hi> 7. All the felicity which the worldling can have, in the point of honour and riches to himselfe, and his posterity, is worldly wealth while he liveth, and a number of children to enjoy his wealth after him; whether they shall live and inherit it, whether they shall prove wise men or fools, he knoweth not; this is his all; for in Gods favour he hath no interest; heaven he hath nothing to doe with; and at the best, <hi>They are full of children, and leave the rest of their substance to their babes.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Ver. 15.</hi> As for me, I will behold thy face in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likenesse.</q>
               <p>He closeth his prayer comfortably, with the hope of true fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity in fellowship with God. <hi>Whence learne,</hi> 1. In the midst of whatsoever worldly trouble <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>e godly can be in, his hope is far better then the worldly mans possession; and the Prophet here, for this cause doth preferre his present condition, being in danger daily of his life, to all his enemies prosperity, saying, by way of opposition, <hi>As for me, I will behold thy face.</hi> 2. The injoying of the presence, and sense of the loving kindnesse of the Lord, is the felicity of the godly, in that measure they attain it; the hope whereof upholds the beleevers heart in the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est times of trouble. <hi>As for me,</hi> saith he, <hi>I will behold thy face.</hi> 3. The enjoying of God is proper only unto the man justified by Faith, and endeavouring to live righteously; and it is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse with God, that such a man be brought to the enjoying of his hope. <hi>I will behold thy face in righteousnesse,</hi> saith he. 4. There is a sleep of deadnesse of spirit, out of which the shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Gods loving countenance doth awake a beleever, and revive the spirit of the contrite ones; and there is a sleep of death bodily, out of which the loving kindnesse of the Lord shall awake all his own, in the day of the resurrection, when he shall so change them into the similitude of his own holinesse

and glorious felicity, as they shall be fully contented for ever<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and this first and second delivery out of all trouble, may every believer expect and promise to himselfe. <hi>I shal be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likenesse.</hi>

Although our natural stupidity, unbeliefe, and enmity against God, do extenuate the works of Gods providence about his children; yet the believer should look upon them with a spiritual, and discerning eye, and should so set them forth to others, as <hi>David</hi> doth here. 2. The most sensible mutations in heaven and earth, are not so observed by the blind world, as a soul illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate with spiritual light wil observe Gods spiritual provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in his works towards his people, and toward himselfe, as here <hi>Davids</hi> example doth shew. 3. The history of the Lords redeeming of his Church, set down in Scripture, and by <hi>David</hi> alluded unto, may be seen in Gods particular dealing with his children, as very like to the same, and as appendicles of the same work repeated. This is imported in <hi>Davids</hi> re-calling to memory what is said, <hi>Exod.</hi> 9.23, 24. and 9.18. <hi>Iosh.</hi> 10.11. <hi>Iudg.</hi> 5.4. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.18. concerning the Lords manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting of himselfe. 4.

Whether God use means or not in our deliveries, the work must ever be ascribed to him alone. <hi>He sent from above, and took me out.</hi> 3.

A soul sensible of Gods merciful worke, cannot satisfie it selfe with expressions about it.

When a man is inclosed, and prevented from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scaping out of trouble, faith would faile, and then despaire should follow, if God did not interpose himselfe, and did not furnish strength in this difficulty. <hi>David</hi> being thus circumven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, saith, <hi>But the Lord was my stay.</hi> 6. The Lord doth not leave his work about his owne, til he perfect it, but he compleateth their delivery ere he cease, and doth crown his mercy with joy: To express this, <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>He brought me forth also into a large place</hi>

               <p>The third part of the Psalme, wherein he goeth on to amplifie mercy sundry waies, and first from the cause of it, which is the meer good will and love of God. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. That the cause of any mercy shewn to us, is not to be found in us, but in Gods free love, <hi>He delivered me, because he delighted in me.</hi> 2. The beliefe of Gods love sweetneth and commendeth the mercy exceedingly: The delivery here is great, but this word, <hi>because he delighted in me,</hi> is far more sweet, <hi>verse</hi> 20. There is another point of amplifying the mercy of his preservation and delivery, in the clearing of his innocency<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and freeing of 'him from the slanders of ungratitude, rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, treachery against his Father in law, and his Prince, which was the fruit of another grace of God, given unto him, to wit, righteousnesse and innocency, in relation to his enemies, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. and a study to keep Gods commands, <hi>ver.</hi> 21. and the feare of God fastening him to Gods Statutes, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. and sincere and tender walking with God, and watching over the sin which did most beset him, <hi>ver.</hi> 23. where his delivery from his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and clearing his innocency from calumnies, was a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious reward, <hi>ver.</hi> 24. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. In a good cause, it is necessary we have a good carriage, lest we marre our cause, and our comfort also: For <hi>David</hi> studied <hi>righteousnesse and clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of hands,</hi> in relation to his enemies, when he was most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly persecuted. 2. A godly behaviour in a good cause shall not want the fruit: For the free love of God <hi>rewarded David according to his righteousnesse.</hi> 3. The conscience of a godly behaviour in time of persecution, is twice profitable: once under the trial and trouble, it doth <hi>support</hi>: againe, after the delivery, the looking back upon it, doth <hi>comfort,</hi> as here is shewne. 4. As we should at all times take heede to our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, so in special, when by persecution we are troubled for a good cause: For now we are upon the trial of our faith, patience, wisdome, and other graces, as <hi>David</hi> was: and should do as he doth here. 5. We have special rules of good behaviour set down in <hi>Davids</hi> example; first, we must be sure to follow such wayes, as Gods word doth allow, that wee may say, <hi>I have kept the wayes of the Lord.</hi> Secondly, if in our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity we be miscarried at any time, we must not persist in a
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:41635:52"/>
wrong course, but return to the way of Gods obedience, That we may say<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 
                  <hi>I have not wickedly departed from my God,</hi> neither in the point of belief, nor practical obedience. Thirdly, we must set all the commands of God, and his written judgments before us, to be observed, one as well as another, and must have respect to Gods threatned, and executed judgments also, that we may say with <hi>David, All his judgments were before mee. and I did not put away his statutes from mee.</hi> Fourthly, We must study sincerity in our carriage, doing good actions well from right <hi>principles,</hi> and for the <hi>right end,</hi> that we may say, <hi>I was also upright before him.</hi> Fifthly, We must keepe strict watch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our wicked nature, and most raging passions and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, lest they break out; that our conscience may not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict us, when we say, <hi>I have kept my selfe from mine iniquity.</hi> 6. It is wisdome to joyne one mercy with onother, in our rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning, that we may say that we have gotten grace for grace, as <hi>David</hi> doth acknowledge, That as God had given to him grace to study righteousnesse and innocency, <hi>so had he recompensed him according to his righteousnesse.</hi> 7.

For <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaid</hi> presupposeth here, that he may, yea, and that he shall be thereafter in <hi>darknesse,</hi> and want for a while <hi>the Candle light</hi> of consolation. 2. As the godly man may expect crosses, so may he be sure also of as many consolations, and sweet seasonings of his troubles<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and deliverances out of them; so that he may say, both before trouble come, and in the midst of it, <hi>The Lord will light my Candle, and my God will enlighten my darknesse.</hi>

               <p>The Fourth part of the Psalme, wherein he praiseth the Lord expresly, for what he had found in him; and in this he is a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall type of Christ, in his conquest and victories. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of his praysing, are four, set down in order. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The constant, equable, and old way of Gods dealing with those that beleeve in him, is a matter of Gods praise; and a reason why the experience of one beleever may be a ground of hope for another, to finde the like, because it is said here, <hi>As for God, his way is perfect.</hi> This is one reason of his praise, and of the beleevers hope. 2. In all times by-gon, experience hath proved the word of the Lord to be most solidly true. Which serveth for the second reason of praising God, and grounding of our hope; <hi>The word of the Lord is tryed.</hi> 3.

A fourth reason of Gods praise, and ground of our hope is, that as there is no true Religion, nor true Faith save one, so there is no true God save onely one, whose true and tryed word, is with his true Church and Saints, who beleeve in him: <hi>For who is God save the Lord? or who is a rock save our God?</hi> 5.

There is no ground to build our confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and felicity upon, save God alone, who is in Covenant through Christ with us: <hi>who is a rock save our God?</hi>

The man whom the Lord sendeth out to fight his Battels, he will arme him compleatly from head to foot; <hi>He will gird him with strength, and make his way plaine and perfect; he will make his feet swift, he will furnish him with a retiring place on high, he will furnish him with a Bow of steel,</hi> and with all armes offensive, and will enable him with more skill and strength then to make use of them; he will furnish him also with <hi>a shield of salvation,</hi> which shall save him in effect: and with all arms defensive, and uphold him by his right hand, when he is like to be overcome; and by his tender care of him, wil make him a great man, a valiant man of war, <hi>and hold him on his feet,</hi> that he fall not in his service.

               <p>In the fifth and last part of the Psalm, he promiseth to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe the setling and enlargement of his own Kingdome, and prophesieth also of Christs Kingdome represented thereby. <hi>Whence learn.</hi> 1. As was <hi>Davids,</hi> so is Christs Kingdom, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to intestine commotions, tumults and dissentions; as in the one there was, so in the other hath been, and will be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and <hi>strivings of the people,</hi> raised by Satan, fostered by wicked hypocrites, and by the corruption of the Lords chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. 2. Such striving and dissention do put our Lords King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in a sort of hazard, if we look to second causes, so as there will be need of Gods help for a delivery from it. But the Kingdome of Christ shall stand for all that, notwithstanding these contentions, that it may still be said of his Kingdome, as it is said here of the typicall Kingdome, and is prophesied of Christs Kingdome, <hi>Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people.</hi> 3. To the Prophet it was revealed, that Christs Kingdome was not to remaine straitned within the bounds of <hi>Iudea,</hi> but to be extended to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> over whom Christ was to reign, and now hath he a long time reign'd. <hi>The Father,</hi> as he made <hi>David</hi> the Type, so <hi>hath he made Christ head of the heathen.</hi> 4. The wickednesse of a person or people, whose works have been most loathsome to the Lord, cannot hinder him to shew mercy to them through Christ, when he pleaseth to convert them. For he hath said, <hi>A people whom I have not known, shall serve me:</hi> which hath oft-times come to passe, and will yet more bee seen effectually. 5. The word of the Lord is the Scepter of his Kingdome, the sword whereby he subdueth people to himself; <hi>as soon as they hear of me,</hi> saith the Lord, in the mouth of his Type, and Prophet, they shall obey me. 6. The more room the word gets in a mans heart, and the sooner it be believed and obeyed, after signification of Gods will to him by his word, the more kindly is the conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the more of the Lords power is evidenced: as here is imported in, <hi>assoon as they hear of me.</hi> 7. When Christ subdueth Nations to himselfe by his word, and doth convert the elect, or his own redeemed ones: strangers in heart will come also outwardly unto the society of his Church and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, though fainedly. <hi>The strangers shall submit themselves to me; fainedly,</hi> as the word importeth. 8. Even this outward
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:41635:55"/>
offer of submission to Christs Kingdome, made by strangers, coming to the visible Church, is not refused, but received <hi>pro tanto,</hi> and made a matter of glorifying of Christ. <hi>The stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers shall fainedly submit themselves to me.</hi> For it is no small glory to Christ that the Majesty of his Word and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, doth make many stoop before him, who are not turned truely unto him. Mean time, albeit by entring into, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to the external covenant, a man be admitted into the visible Church, and outer Court of Gods house, yet not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reall conversion is a man made a member of the invisible Church, and admitted into the inner Court of heaven.</p>

               <p>He prophesieth what shall become of Christ enemies at length. <hi>Whence learne.</hi> 1. As some strangers shall come into the outward fellowship of Christs Kingdom, so others of them shall remain professed strangers, and dis-affected to his Kingdome, and whether strangers within, or without, shal continue to be strangers stil, both of them shall perish. <hi>For strangers shall fade away.</hi> 2. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit Christ at first, may have many enemies, and unfriends where he cometh to set up his Kingdome, yet where and when he pleaseth to stay, and keep up his Kingdom, his open enemies shall grow fewer. <hi>The strangers shall fade away</hi>: to wit, where he minds to stay, and for that end thinks good to diminish them. 3. Whether the Lord be pleased to convert strangers, or not, their strong holds, (whether their high imaginations, or their earthly power) shall not be able to stand before him; let him come to convert them outwardly or inwardly also, or destroy them, as he shall be pleased, his terrour shall affright them; <hi>For the strangers</hi> (before him) <hi>shall be afraid out of their close pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi>

The end of all our speeches, concerning what we have been imployed into, and have done, or have had successe in, should be to shew forth the glory of God to others, and to offer praise and thanks to him: for this, <hi>Blessed be my rock, &amp;c.</hi> is the end whereunto <hi>Davids</hi> example doth drive. 2. <hi>Life,</hi> and <hi>blessed life, quickening life</hi>

The sacrifice of praise offered up in the Church, as it is the work of the Saints in one respect, so it is the work of Christ in another respect, because he raiseth by his Spirit the song in their hearts, and offereth up the sacrifice of thanks unto the Father.

The Doctrine of life and salvation, set down to us in Gods word, as a law to us, and a rule of faith and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, needeth no deck of humane traditions; it is sufficient in it selfe, and wanteth nothing necessary unto salvation; <hi>For the Law of the Lord is perfect.</hi> 2.

This word being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood rightly, as it may be understood when it is compared with it selfe, one part of it with another, and other means also used, which God hath appointed, may be safely relyed upon: it will not disappoint a man; <hi>For the testimony of the Lord is sure.</hi> 5. Albeit there be many deep mysteries in this word, which may exercise the greatest wits, yet for the points necessary for the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of every soul, it is so plaine and clear, that it may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood by persons of mean wits, and may make those who are otherwise dull of understanding, wise to salvation; for it is a <hi>testimony making wise the simple.</hi> 6. Nothing is commanded by God in his word, but that which the illuminate soul must sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe unto, as equitable in it self, and profitable to us. <hi>For the statutes of the Lord are right.</hi> 7.

The way of worshipping, fearing, and serving God, set down in his word, is holy, and in substance the same in all generations, and alwayes unalterable by man for ever. <hi>The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring for ever.</hi> 11. The doctrines set downe in the word of God, are all of them decrees of the almighty Law-giver, given forth in his owne Court with authority uncontrolable; all of them are true and worthy to be obeyed; for the <hi>judgments of the Lord are true, and righteous altogether.</hi> 12. The word of God isable to enrich a man more then all the riches in the world, because it is able to bring him to an everlasting Kingdome; for Gods judgments being as judicial sentences, to determine all necessary truths and controversies, about saving truth, <hi>are more to be desired then gold, yea then much fine gold.</hi> 13.

For beside all the former commendation, he addeth, <hi>Moreover by them is thy servant warned.</hi> 3.

               <p>He puts up another petition, to wit, That he may be preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from presumptuous sins. <hi>Hence learne,</hi> 1. Holiest men are most sensible of their by-gone sins, and so also of their naturall sinfulnesse, and readinesse to fall, whereof the Prophet here is to fear, saying, <hi>Keep back also thy servant from presumptuous sins.</hi> 2. Even the regenerate, if the Lord doe not keep them from ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or if he leave them in tentation, unto their own will and strength, they may fal into most scandalous sins, against the light of their conscience, and be slaves thereunto; Therefore pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth he <hi>to be kept back from presumptuous sins, and that God would not suffer such sins to have dominion over him</hi>; insinuating his own weaknesse, if God did not prevent, did not assist and helpe him to prevaile against them. 3.

               <p>The third petition, is, for the acceptance of his service in his prayer, and purpose of heart. <hi>Whence learne,</hi> 1.

               <p>FRom this prayer of the Church for the King of <hi>Israel. Learn,</hi> 1. It is the duty of all the godly, where-ever they live,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:41635:60"/>
to pray for the welfare of their Kings, Rulers, and Magistrates, as this example teacheth. 2. Greatest men, though they be also gracious, are subject to trouble: for even the best of the Kings of <hi>Israel,</hi> and Christ typified by them, were not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted therefrom. <hi>The Lord hear thee in the day of trouble.</hi> 3. It is the part of such as desire the prayers of others to bee made for them, to pray also themselves, were they never so great Kings; and prayer must be counted their best weapons in trouble; <hi>The Lord hear thee,</hi> saith he, <hi>in the day of thy trouble.</hi> 4. No defence to be expected from God, but when he is look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon and believed in as he is <hi>manifested</hi> to us in his word. Therefore he saith, <hi>The Name of the God of Iacob defend thee.</hi> Or, God who in his word hath revealed himselfe to <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> and entred in covenant to be his God, <hi>defend thee.</hi> 5. It is by vertue of Gods dwelling amongst men, and his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king on mans nature in the person of Christ (represented by Gods presence in <hi>Sion</hi> and the Sanctuary) that help must be expected from God. Therefore saith he, <hi>The Lord send thee help out of the Sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of Sion.</hi> 6. Kings and all for whom the godly may pray with confidence, must be worshippers of God, believers in Christ, relyers upon the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of this only once offered sacrifice, represented by often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated typical burnt offerings. For this is imported in, <hi>The Lord remember all thy offerings, and accept thy burnt sacrifices.</hi> For it is for Christs sacrifice that we are accepted, and that any grace is granted to us. 7. A believer in Christ, praying according to the revealed will of God, ask what he will, it shall be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; he who studieth to walk sincerely before God, studying to do what is pleasant to Gods heart, shall receive satisfactory answers according to his own hearts wish. Upon this ground the prayer goeth here, <hi>The Lord grant thee according to thine own heart, and fulfill all thy counsel.</hi> 8. Whosoever do partake with Christs Subjects in trouble, shall share with them also in the joy of their deliverance; therefore it is said, <hi>We will rejoyce in thy salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> 9. When it goeth well with the King, and chiefe Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, it goeth the better with all the subjects, and the praise of delivery and welfare redoundeth to the glory of God who is the fountain of all felicity; for, <hi>In the Name of our God, we shall set up our banners,</hi> saith the Church, if God shall blesse the King.</p>

That which terrifieth the believer in the first assault of a tentation, before he go to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, is contemned by the believer when he looks to the Lord, his true defence; Charets and horses when they are invading Gods people are terrible: but now when the Lord is remembred, they are here set at nought in comparison. 7. The condition of the worldly man and of the enemies of Gods people seems to be the better, at the first, and the condition of the Church the worse. But a short resolution cometh, which determineth the question in the end; the standing of the ungodly is follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a fall; and the low condition of the godly hath a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter condition following upon it. The worldly man, and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:41635:61"/>
is brought down, and falleth. But the godly are made to say, <hi>We are risen and stand upright.</hi> 8. True confidence strengthens it selfe by prayer, <hi>Save Lord.</hi> 9. That which is prayed for in the type, is perfected in Christ, who is the truth; salvation is granted to all his Subjects, whensoever they call. <hi>Let the King hear us when we call.</hi> 10. And when the Lord is relyed upon for safety, the means shall have the promised bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing. The Kings of <hi>Israel</hi> were to be the more usefull to the people when safety was sought from the Lord. First, they pray, <hi>Save us,</hi> and then, <hi>Let the King hear us when we call,</hi> or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore him.</p>

               <p>The benefits bestowed on the King, and his Kingdome, are seven or eight, which are so many reasons of thanksgiving. The first is joy in the Kings heart, for strength and salvation given unto him. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. As prayer is necessary, so also is thanksgiving; and the offering of both to God, as it is our duty, so it is his due; and as we should seek the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of others in prayers, so should we seek their concurrence in praises: And he that offereth prayer one day, shall have matter of praise to offer another day, as here we are taught. 2. Christ, and all his true Subjects, are sure to be furnished with furniture of strength from God, for every imployment, and to be delivered out of every danger by God, and to have joy and rejoycing in the experimental feeling thereof. For, <hi>The King shall joy in thy strength, O Lord, and in thy salvation how greatly shall be rejoyce?</hi> This is the first reason of praise and thanks, for this first benefit. The second benefit bestowed on Christ, to be forth-coming to his true Subjects, is this, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory answers shall be given to all the articles of Christs intercession, and all the articles of the Saints warrantable sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications. <hi>Thou hast given him his hearts desire, and hast not with-holden the request of his lips.</hi> The third benefit is this
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:41635:62"/>
There shall be a ready out-giving of liberall gifts for Christs subjects, and fruits of Gods love, before the need thereof be felt, or observed; <hi>Thou preventest him with the blessing of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi>: The fourth benefit is right, and title, and possession given to Christ; a name of glory, or the gift of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </q>
               <p>IN this exercise of <hi>David</hi> the type, and of Christ represented here, both doe agree in these four things. 1. Both are under
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:41635:64"/>
the sense of wrath, and of oppressing trouble. 2. Both are tempted to doubting and desperation. 3. Both wrestle against the tentation, and against trouble, the occasion thereof; And 4. Both get the victory. But they differ in these four things. First, In the measure of the trouble; <hi>Davids</hi> trouble was little in comparison of Christs trouble; <hi>David</hi> laid not down his life under trouble; but Christs trouble was incomparably more, and his soul made heavy unto death, and the trouble tooke his life from him. Secondly, In the manner of the trouble they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer; for <hi>Davids</hi> trouble was only a probatory exercise, without vindictive wrath; not a curse, but a crosse, for trying of him, and training of him to believe against sense; which trouble of his paid no debt, neither his owne, nor any others; but Christs trouble was a vindictive and avengefull punishment; for reall wrath was against him, as he was bearing our sins, and the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter curse of the Law was cast upon him: for he was made a curse for us; and his punishment paid our debt, and was expiatory and satisfactory to justice. Thirdly, though both <hi>David</hi> and Christ were tempted to doubting and desperation, yet <hi>Davids</hi> tentation could not be sinlesse, because of his sinful imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, common to him, and all the rest of the godly; The ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation got some advantage of him, because of the imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his knowledge, faith, love, and abilities; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the power of the body of original sin in him. But Christs passive tentation was altogethet sinlesse, and could not have any sin at all on his part; for albeit he was tempted in all things like unto us, yet it is said, <hi>without sin.</hi> Because when the Prince of this world, Satan, came and took essay of him, he found none of his own stuffe in Christ: he had <hi>nothing in him</hi> to work upon; and it was impossible that sin could be in him, being <hi>the holy one of Israel our sanctifier, Holy Lord God Almighty,</hi> and man also in one person, <hi>Isa.</hi> 6.3. <hi>Iob.</hi> 12.41. Fourthly, they differ in their wrestling, and victory; for <hi>David</hi> wrestled not in his own strength, got not the victory in his own strength, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

But Christ wrestled and got the victory in his owne strength, which is one with the strength of the Father. For he is Jehovah our righteousnesse. In all the Psalme wee shal look<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> upon every passage, not so much as it concerneth <hi>David</hi> the type, as wherein it concerneth Christ the truth. In the first conflict
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:41635:65"/>
of the sense of trouble with faith; Learn from the words as they are Christs words. 1. God is Christs God; he being conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as God and man, in one person, entred in the Covenant of redemption with the Father as Mediatour and Surety for men; That he shall satisfie justice, and doe all the Fathers will in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of the Elect, and that God shall be his God, and the God of all the Elect redeemed by him. Therefore doth he here say, <hi>My God, my God.</hi> 2. Faith, as it is a vertue giving perfect trust and credit unto Gods promises made to his Son the Redeemer, is a part of that original holinesse in the man Christ, and a point of his personal perfection, sutable to his imployment. This faith he professeth while he saith, <hi>My God, my God.</hi> 3. Christ, as man lying under the curse of the law for us, was really deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and forsaken for a time, in regard of all sensible consolation: for it behoved him to bear the wrath, or effects of wrath, due to our sins really, so far as might satisfie for us, and relieve us from wrath. Its true, the man Christ could no more be forsaken, in regard of divine presence supporting him, then the personal union of the two natures could be dissolved: But in regard of sensible consolation, he was by way of punishment for our sins, and by way of cursing our sin in him, really in our stead for a while, deprived, as man, of the sense of the comfort of his owne God-head. The sense of wrath filling now the soul of the man to the brim, and running over. Therefore speaks he of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking, <hi>Why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> 4. As sense and reason can expresse themselves in seeming contradictory terms, and yet without contradiction can very well agree in their seeming opposite, and inconsistent expressions; so can faith and sense ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse themselves, in seeming contradictory terms, and yet ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wel agree; for as sense, and paine, and sicknesse in the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, can in its own language, and style of natural feeling, say to the Chirurgion, cutting and lancing the flesh, and to the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician who hath given a bitter portion<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 
                  <hi>you have hurt me,</hi> you have <hi>made me sick</hi>: when indeed in the stile of reason and wit, he hath been healing the man, and recovering him from sicknesse. So sense of sorrow, grief, pain, and affliction, desertion, and wrath can speak in the terms of natural feeling, that which may seeme to crosse, but doth not indeed crosse faith speaking in the terms and language of supernatural Theological truth. Therefore <hi>My God, my God,</hi> spoken in the perfection of faiths language, can very well agree with, <hi>Why hast thou forsaken me? why art thou so far from helping of me, and from the words of my roaring?</hi>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:41635:65"/>
spoken here in the language of perfect natural sense; for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect faith, and perfect natural sense were in our Lord Christ, very God, and very man, compleatly holy. 5. Bitter was the cup of Divine wrath, which Christ did drinke: great was the price our Redeemer paid, to ransome us, when the sense thereof drew forth of his Majesty such expressions. Thus faith and feeling may both speak, each of them their owne language to God in one breath, as here they do. Now as these words are <hi>Davids,</hi> who had in him sinful corruption of nature, <hi>Learne,</hi> 1. Sense, and tentation, and corrupt nature, may represent God in his dispensations to his own children, as if he had forsaken altogether, and regarded not their hard condition, and would not helpe, as here is shewn in <hi>Davids</hi> experience. 2. Faith should correct sense, and refute tentations, and bridle effecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and not suffer their words to go forth, expressing sense or appearance of doubting of Gods favour, till first faith speak, and goe before, and fasten its gripes on the Covenant; as here faith goeth formost, and calleth the Lord, <hi>My God, my God,</hi> before that sense utter a word. 3. At one time, and in one exercise, these three may concur. 1. Desertion in the point of comfort. 2. Growing trouble without help seene. And 3. Apparent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting of prayer: And these three joyned together do set sore upon the faith of a child of God. For continuance of trouble is a sore tentation, albeit comfort be now and then mixed: want of sensible comfort, mixed with trouble, doubleth the burden, and disquieteth the mind much: but to seem to lose la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in prayer, made for either help or comfort, is the heaviest part of the exercise: <hi>I cry day and night, and thou hearest not,</hi> is a sad condition. 4. In this case it is the best remedie, to lay the worst of our thoughts single before the Lord, and to tell him whatsoever is suggested to us, and not to be Secretars to Satan; but to reveale our selves fully to God, and fix our selves on the Covenant of Grace, wherein we have closed with him; yea, and to double and treble our gripes of, <hi>My God.</hi>

It is wisdome for a soul in a sad exercise, to take side and part with Faith, to gather arguments to strengthen it, to divert the mind from thinking still on its calamity, and to set it upon the contemplation of Gods perfections in himselfe, and toward us in his Gospel, and of the passages of his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence toward his people, whereby he hath purchased constant praises at their hands: In the right of which praises and posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion whereof, God is resolved to keep himselfe and to dwel there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in as in a habitation wherein he delights to remain. <hi>O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel.</hi> 3.

               <p>The second conflict, wherein the sense of trouble is set forth as a new assaulting of Faith. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Never was any child of God before Christ, under so much misery as Christ was himself: His own heavens, his own Father, his own God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head did hide their face and consolation from him: Our sins willingly taken on him, and Gods wrath pressed the weight of punishment with the full power of Justice, both upon his soule and body: These for whom he died despised him, he himselfe
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:41635:66"/>
being emptied of all things which make men respected to the world, and depressed lower then ever any man was, as a worme to be trod upon, he was made a matter of common talk, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach in all mens mouths; set at naught by the basest of the people; derided, and scorned in his most holy behaviour; sport, and matter of laughter was made of his sufferings; malice feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it selfe with pleasure, upon his paine and misery, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing it selfe with the basest signes of disgrace, which disdain could devise, for flouting of him, mocking of his saving do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and faithful testimony given unto it; insulting over him, as if he had been neither Gods Son, nor an honest man: and all this was counted little enough for satisfaction to Justice exacting of him, as the due punishment of our sins, whatsoever is imported in the sad expressions, set down in the Text. 2. As the more misery the children of God are under, the more doth tentation make their misery seem weighty, for bearing downe of their confidence in God: So the more that misery seemeth to grow, and the world to turn their back on Gods children in their tryals, the more should they draw neer to God, and lay out their case be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, as here we are taught by this example. 3. Let no man wonder to be despised of men, and mocked for religion; for so was the man according to Gods own heart, and Christ our Lord mocked more then any, in his sad sufferings. <hi>Let God deliver him, seeing he delighteth in him,</hi> said his enemies.</p>

               <p>Here faith opposeth whatsoever the complaint could import, to the prejudice of confidence, and laboureth to strengthen it selfe by all arguments. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. As Satan maketh as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault after assault, against Faith, upon new representations of calamity and misery; so we should raise bulwark after bulwark for defence; and after we have looked upon other mens experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences before us, we should recount our own experiences of Gods are towards us, and should make use of all that the Lord hath done unto us, for our strengthning; for so doth this example
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:41635:67"/>
teach us. 2. Albeit men in a fit of misbelief, will admit no proofe of Gods respect unto them, except singularities, and wil question also speciall grace, when it is given; yet the humbled believer is so wise, as to make use of the most common benefit which the man hath received from God for confirmation of his owne faith; even the ordinary work of our conception, frame of body, birth, and education may suffice us to draw in to God who made us, and hath done so much for us (ere we could im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore him, or doe any thing for our selves) as may incourage us to come to him, and seek his favour, whatsoever objection can be made to the contrary; for this example teacheth us so to doe. 3. Seeing the Lord doth many things for us, which in the time when he doth them for us, we doe not observe; it is our duty to look upon them afterwards, that they may furnish us with matter of praise to God and faith in him; for so doth this example teach us. 4. Whatsoever instruments and means the Lord maketh use of, the spirituall eye pierceth through them, and looketh on God as worker of all things, for and upon them, from their cradle. <hi>Thou tookest me out of my mothers wombe.</hi> 5. Children borne within the Covenant have God for their God, from their nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and may lay their reckoning so; and whensoever they would draw neer to God, to make use of the Covenant, they may say, <hi>Thou art my God from my mothers belly.</hi> 6. The approaching of trouble, and neernesse of danger should draw us neer to God; who in an instant can interpose himself between us and the evil: and the lesse help we have beside the Lord himselfe, the more hope may we have to be helped by God; This is the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets plea, <hi>Be not far from me, for trouble is neer, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>From <hi>ver.</hi> 12. to 22. is the third conflict of Sense with Faith, upon the consideration of the multitude, power and cruelty of his enemies, compared with his owne infirmity, now emptied of all strength to resist them; and these are mixed one with another. The enemies terriblenesse is first set forth, then his emptinesse and weaknesse by turnes, to <hi>v.</hi> 19. unto all which faith opposeth it selfe, by prayer to God, to <hi>v.</hi> 22, He compareth (<hi>v.</hi> 12, 13.) his persecuters to <hi>Buls, many buls,</hi> strong, cruel, gaping, roaring,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:41635:67"/>
devouring <hi>Lions. Whence learn,</hi> 1. The persecuters of Christ and his people, are but beastly, sensual bodies, sold to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent world, and destitute of grace and humility; more like in their rage to savage beasts then to rationall men; commonly also they are men of riches, and worldly power, <hi>fed and fat Buls</hi>; and many in number, all of them ready for an ill turne, and so cruel, that nothing lesse wil satisfie them, then blood and slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as they are here described. And no wonder that Christs ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants shall finde it so in their case, seeing Christ himselfe and his servants before us have had experience of such enemies.</p>

               </q>
               <p>What the Lord wrought upon his body, and natural spirits, and strength, is here set downe. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. It was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by God, that with outward persecution of Christ, by his cruel adversaries, the Father should bruise him and breake him inwardly also, and punish him with all severity: for here his suffering is in body and mind, in flesh and bones, in his natural spirit, and natural courage, in heart, and whole strength, that in nothing he should be unpunished, wherein we sinners are found polluted; to the intent that he being fully emptied, the ransome might be full; he is <hi>poured out like water,</hi> and empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of all that the created humane nature could furnish. The ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of Divine Justice and wrath did in a manner loose <hi>all the joynts of his body,</hi> so that natural courage, before the dreadfull avenger of sin, did fail: <hi>his heart was made soft like wax to receive</hi> and keep the impression of Divine terrour, til justice should be satisfied, and was dissolved like wax, in the point of resolution to withstand it. <hi>It is melted in the midst of his bowels,</hi> his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural strength is dryed, burnt up like a <hi>potsheard,</hi> baken in the fire, his mouth was stopped from all defence and apology; for he was content to be holden as guilty, standing in our room. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his tongue cleaved to his jawes.</hi> And in a word, the hand of God exacteth the full price of him, and brings him downe so, as there is not a bit of him free of the punishment. <hi>Thou,</hi> saith he, <hi>hast brought me into the dust of death.</hi> This <hi>David</hi> had but a taste
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:41635:68"/>
of in his deepest trouble: The verity and weight of this, is to be found only in Christ, of whom this was prophecied, that it should come, and indeed is come, done and ended, and so it behoved to be.</p>

               <p>Againe he bringeth forth his enemies part, to shew us that Christs enemies were to prove but bloody dogs, when they should be let loose upon him, whom nothing but Crucifie him, crucifie him, could satisfie: and such will they be still who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute his Church. Next, to shew, that although his enemies were to be the assembly of the visible Church, for open profession, yet by rejecting of his grace, and opposing of him, in Gods sight and estimation, they were holden for the <hi>assembly of the wicked.</hi> Thirdly, to foreshew the death of the Crosse to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for Christ, it is said, <hi>They pierced my hands and my feet.</hi>

               </q>
               <p>Another, and further point of Christs fore-prophecied suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, is his nakednesse on the Crosse, and the discovery of his leane body (being wasted with decreed sorrowes) and the gazing of his enemies upon him hanging on the Crosse, and the part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his garments among the souldiers, and the casting of lots for his upper garment, because it was woven, and could not be divided. <hi>Whence learne,</hi> 1. All that our Lord Jesus suffered, was before decreed and agreed upon, betwixt the Father and the Son, and foretold by Christ himselfe long before his incarnation, speaking by his Spirit in his Prophets, as here appeareth, by the description of our Lords death and passion, so plainly and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, as if it were a History, and not a prophecy. 2. Beside paine of body, leannesse of flesh, with daily sorrowes and trouble of spirit, the least disgrace done to our Lord, the least wrong, a look unto him, the least injurie in the matter of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:41635:68"/>
or our consciences quieted, for the expiation of our sin, by his suffering in body, soul, same, apparell, and every other thing else, wherein justice could overtake the guil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Unto this last assault, faith opposeth prayer for divine assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, for strength to bear out, and for delivery; in all which he was heard. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Faith is made victorious over all as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults, by opening of its tentations to God, and putting up prayer to him for help, as here is seen. 2. If God shall not withdarw his sweet presence for supporting a soul, albeit it should not finde his presence for comforting of it, supporting presence may suffice in a time of sad exercise: for this much did satisfie our God in his agony. <hi>Be not thou far from me, O Lord.</hi> 3. Faith findeth God to be its strength when the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever is emptied of his own strength; <hi>O my strength,</hi> saith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> the type, and Christ as man by him represented. 4. As the hast of our necessity doth require, we may without limitation request the Lord to haste: <hi>Haste thee to help me.</hi>

               <p>He prayeth to be delivered from the violent blood-shedder, and bloudy doggish persecuter, and from the cruell lion-like oppressour, and then saith presently, that he is heard and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the power of the enemies which were setting upon him as Unicorns. Now concerning <hi>David,</hi> the matter is clear<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> for he was delivered so from his enemies, that they got not his life: But of Christ the question may be, how he was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, seeing his life is taken: For answer, Christ here doth say, that he was delivered; and so it was indeed; for when he had payed the price, he was not holden by the bonds of death, and the grave, but rose again the third day. <hi>Whence learne,</hi> 1. Christ was no lesse delivered from dogs, liÃ³ns, unicorns, his persecuting enemies, by his resurrection after death, then if he had been taken out of their hands, when they came to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend him in the Garden; yea, this delivery out of the grave, was a farre greater delivery then if he had not been slain at all:
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:41635:69"/>
For then he had delivered himself onely, and not us: But now by the laying down of his life, he hath discharged himself of his suretiship for us, and delivered us with himself, and so hath saved both himselfe and us; yea, by his rising out of the grave, he is demonstrate more fully to be the <hi>Son</hi> of God, then by any of his miraculous escapings out from the hands of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, when they were about to apprehend him. <hi>Thou hast heard me,</hi> that is, delivered me. 2. To get victory over trouble, is a no lesse glorious delivery from trouble, then to be preserved from falling into trouble; yea, its a more glorious delivery. For the troubles are broken, by falling on the believer, like waves of the sea on the rock, and the believer remaineth vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, and setled as a rock. 3. It is a notable argument of confidence to be heard by way of delivery, when a man can say he hath in extremity of danger prayed, and hath been heard as a Supplicant: <hi>Save me, for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns.</hi>

               <p>After the conflict, the victory and out-gate by way of thanksgiving is set down, to the end of the Psalme: wherein <hi>Davids</hi> part is but a little shadow, and is swallowed up here in Christs glory, shining in the fruits of his passion and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection. <hi>Learn</hi> from <hi>Davids</hi> part: That delivery foreseen by faith, worketh in some sort the effects of the delivery past in effect; to wit, quietnesse, peace, joy, and thanksgiving; as here is to be seen. From Christs part promising and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecying of the fruits of his death and resurrection, <hi>Learn</hi> 1. Christ, though he be God Almighty, yet by reason of his incarnation, for the redeemeds sake, he is not ashamed to call them <hi>Brethren.</hi> 2. The preaching of the Gospel of Christs satisfaction for our sins by death, and of his resurrection for our justification, is the matter of great praise to God, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to the redeemed: <hi>I will declare,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>thy name to my brethren.</hi> 3. In the right preaching of the Gospel, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters are in effect but Christs voice. Christ himselfe is the principall Prophet and Preacher: <hi>For I,</hi> saith he, <hi>will declare thy name in the midst of the great Congregation</hi>; to wit, of the whole Catholick Church on earth.</p>

Such as are made partakers of the benefit of Christs passion, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, are chiefly called, and bound to praise God for their redemption, and to fear God more and more, that they may be more and more fitted to praise and glorifie him; for of a sanctified mouth onely will God accept praise. <hi>Ye that fear the Lord, praise him; All ye seed of Iacob, glorifie him; and fear him, all ye the seed of Israel.</hi> 2 The Fathers hearkening unto Christs intercession, and delivering of him from our sin, and our deserved punishment laid upon him, is the common benefit of all the redeemed, the matter of their common thanksgiving and praise, and the matter of their assurance of their delivery from sin and death; Of the certainty of which delivery Christs deliverance is both a cause, and a pawn. <hi>For he hath not hid his face from him, but when he cried, he heard him.</hi> 3. Neither the sense of a mans own meanesse, and despicablenesse, nor the mean estimation that the world hath of him, will prejudge him when he is supplicant at the Lords hand. <hi>For he hath not despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, nor abhorred the afflictions of the afflicted.</hi>

               <p>He reneweth the promise of thanksgiving, which as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth <hi>David,</hi> teacheth, 1.

For here he reneweth his promise to praise. 2. The Lord, and the Lord only, is the Theme which the believer handleth in point of praise; no other subject of praise acknowledgeth he; <hi>My praise shall be of thee, &amp;c.</hi> 3.

to their calling: <hi>My praise shall be of thee in the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.</hi> 4.

The Son of God, and promised Son of <hi>David,</hi> Christ Jesus, by all the work of redemption, studieth, as to bring salvation to his elect, so to honour the Father, saying here, <hi>My praise shal be of thee in the great congregation.</hi> 2. Albeit our Lord hath finished all his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking for the payment of the price and ransome of redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet hath he not yet performed all which he hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken for making use of his purchased salvation, unto the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging of the glory of his Father, and gathering into the great congregation all his redeemed ones to be worshippers of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in spirit and truth: But as he is still upon this work from generation to generation, so is he willing still to lie under this engagement, and these vowes, till he perform them to the full: <hi>I will pay my vowes before them that fear him.</hi>

Albeit the believer, at all times, do not find the sweetnesse of this feast, but be put to work after a meal received, put to fight after a feast, and made hungry af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a new meal, and be made to pray for it, and to seek after the Lord in the use of the means, yet shall he eat again in due time, and be satisfied: <hi>For they shall praise the Lord that seek him,</hi> is as much as they that seek him, shall find so much as shall make them both to have cause of praising, and also in effect to praise him. 3. Whatsoever alterations or vicissitudes of things be in the condition of humble believers, seeking more and more communion with God, they may be sure of eternal life, beside what they get by way of earnest in this life. For the Spirit of the Lord directing his speech to them, hath said, <hi>Your heart shall live for ever.</hi>

wanting, during the time of the Lords comfortable entertaining of him, which may strengthen him, or rejoyce him; but as much given unto him sensibly, as may make him say, <hi>Thou an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointest my head with oyl, and my cup runneth over,</hi> Psal. 92.10. <hi>&amp;</hi> 104.15.</p>

The delight and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the believer is not in any earthly portion, but in Gods good wil and pity toward him; Gods goodnesse and mercy is the matter of his contentment. 2.

As a believer may be assured of the constant course of Gods love to follow him, and of his own preserving in the way of life, so may he be perswaded of eternal life, and everlasting communion with God in heaven.

God hath chosen a Church out of all the earth, to be his peculiar people, with whom he may converse, and to whom he may give priviledg of communion for ever with himselfe; he hath his own <hi>holy &amp; high hil,</hi> he hath his own <hi>holy place,</hi> to wit, a holy universal Church, represented by <hi>the hil of Sion,</hi> lifted up above the inferiour valleys; he hath his holy <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> where he giveth the signes of his presence, separate from the common multitude, and wordly affairs; <hi>who shall ascend into the hil of the Lord, and who shall stand in his holy place?</hi> He compareth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible Church, to a <hi>hill</hi> or <hi>mountain,</hi> and <hi>the holy place,</hi> because Gods true Church indeed for firmnesse, durablenesse, dignity above all other Incorporations, and spiritual sublimity, is like a <hi>hill</hi> above the plaine, lifted up above all the world, a holy socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, wherein God delighteth to dwel. 2.

The way to make men true Converts, true believers, true Saints, and inheriters of heaven, is to receive Christ heartily and honourably, to cast up doors in hearty consent of faith and love, like triumphant Archers for welcoming so glorious a conquerour to be their guest; <hi>Lift up your heads, O ye gates, &amp;c.</hi> 2. Whosoever shall receive the offer, and open the heart to him, he shall close cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with him; <hi>Be ye lift up ye everlasting doors, and the King of glory shall come in.</hi> 3. He is an unknown King till he bee manifested to us; and such as are wise, when they hear of him, will seek to know him. <hi>Who is this King of glory?</hi> will be their question. 4.

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:41635:75"/>
and salvation of his people; albeit the ignorance and unbeliefe, and the crosses, and troubles following his Kingdome in this world, do obscure his glory to the carnal eye: And therefore no wonder, that men do oftner move the question about his Kingdom and Glory, asking <hi>Who is the King of glory</hi>? 7. Christ Jesus (whose ascention was prefigured by the ascending of the Ark upon Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> convoyed with <hi>David,</hi> and all <hi>Israel,</hi>) as he is true man, so he is also very God Almighty, one with the Father, and Holy Spirit, in his God-head: for <hi>The Lord of hosts he is the King of glory.</hi>

It is necessary for a Supplicant, if he would have help from God, to loose his confidence off all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture help, and set his eye and heart on God, as <hi>David</hi> here <hi>lifteth up his soul to God.</hi> 2.

It is not enough to act faith in time of a strait; but it is profitable to observe also the least measure of faith bestowed on us, and to entertain it, were it never so little, and to avow it that it may be fixed when we go to pray: for before <hi>David</hi> put up any petition, he prefixeth, <hi>I lift my soul to thee, I trust in thee</hi>: for otherwise the prayer of the Supplicant can find no footing. 4. The believing Supplicant shall never be disapoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of promised help: nor shall the hope and expectation of the enemies of God be satisfied: <hi>He will not suffer the believer to be ashamed, nor the enemy long to triumph.</hi> 5.

Because the Lord in covenanting with us, taketh the work of our salvation in hand, not to lay it down till he have perfected it; he alloweth his children, in all particular difficulties, to hold this ground, and constantly to expect the accomplishment thereof, whatsoever strait they fall into: and to wait for direction how to behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, till it be perfected: for <hi>David</hi> giveth this for a reason of his prayer, <hi>Thou art the God of my salvation; on thee do I wait all the day long.</hi> 3.

of old sins, even from the time of youth, albeit forgiven of God, and forgotten by the beliveever, and the tempter can make use thereof against faith in the day of trouble; in which case the believer without losse may read over blotted accompts, and renew petitions for pardon: <hi>Remember not,</hi> saith <hi>David, the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions.</hi> 2. As God holdeth two Courts in a mans conscience, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sin; one of justice, according to the Law, or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works; another of mercy, according to the Gospel, and Covenant of grace offered in the Mediatour, which is posteriour to the other Court; wherein the man who hath glorified justice, and acknowledged his sin, and deserved perdition, is pardoned; (for the ransome paid by the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah Christ Jesus the Mediatour, to whom the sinner is fled for refuge:) So the believer hath two reckonings with God, about his sins. One according to justice, and another according to mercy; and albeit the believer will never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to read, acknowledge, and subscribe again and again, the first reckoning to be just, yet he will not stand to that reckoning for payment; but will hold him to the last bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain of grace, and mercy, and goodnesse, which cleareth the claim of the first accompt: for this is <hi>Davids</hi> practise here, that the first accompt may be forgotten: <hi>Remember not the sins of my youth.</hi> And that the last accompt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning may stand, and be held in memory, saying, <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy mercy, remember thou me<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
                  </hi> 3.

In the secret exercise of the Sants, a pause may be usefully made in prayer, and a meditation, or soliloquie may be fallen upon, when the Lord doth fit matter for fostering faith, and furthering of prayer, as here we may in <hi>Davids</hi> practice observe. 2. The good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and faithfulnesse of God in his promises, and his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse without respect of persons, to be gracious to every one who cometh unto him, is the fountain of the believers strength, hope, and consolation: <hi>Good and upright is the Lord,</hi> is here a Well of comfort to the Supplicant. 3. The conscience of sinne must not keep the believer back from confidence to be heard in his prayer, when he cometh to seek direction: for from this ground, <hi>That the Lord is good,</hi> the Prophet draweth this consequence, <hi>Therefore will he teach sinners in the way.</hi> 4. Gods justice will not hinder his mercy to be bountifull, nor will former break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of commands, prejudice the sinner, who being weary of his wandring, doth seek to be directed hereafter in the Lords way; <hi>He will teach sinners in the way.</hi> 5. When by affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction a man is humbled, and brought to submit himself to God, he shall not want a guide to lead him out of his trouble, to direct his pathes, till the delivery come; for <hi>God will guide the meek in judgement,</hi> most wisely and discreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as his good requireth, <hi>and teach him his way.</hi> 6. The property of the believer, is to cleave to the covenant, and to what the Lord hath set down in his word, <hi>They keep his covenant, and his testimonies</hi>; and will not part with them whatsoever come. 7. Whosoever do hold fast the covenant of grace, and do make conscience of obeying Gods word, they may be sure that all their troubles, and variety of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise is nothing but Gods way, to make them partake of Gods promises; for unto such <hi>all the pathes of the Lord are mercy and truth.</hi>

The honour of the Lord is ingaged by covenant for remission of sin to the penitent believer, and the Lord counts it a glory to be mercifull; Therefore, saith he, <hi>For thy Names sake pardon.</hi> 3. Faith can make advantage of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefs arguments to retort them against it, and can plead for pardon from the very multitude and grieveousnesse of sin; as here, <hi>Pardon my iniquity, for it is great.</hi> For the greater sin is acknowledged to be, the more is the object of pardon made clear, for it cannot be payed for by the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and the more is the Lords pitty letten forth, that the believer be sensible of the weight.</p>

               <p>In the fourth place there is another meditation of Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to a believer, for strengthening of his faith yet further, wherein he layeth down three generall promises, made to them that believe in God, and do stand in awe to offend, <hi>ver.</hi> 12, 13, 14. and by way of Syllogisme he assumeth of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, that he is a believer, whereupon he inferreth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The fear of God (im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting care to serve God according to his word, and to stand in awe to offend him) is the necessary property of a true and lively believer; Therefore it is made the believers cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance, and mark to discern him by: <hi>What man is he that feareth the Lord?</hi> 2. The believer walking in the fear of God, may expect from the Lord direction and light, how
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:41635:79"/>
to carry himselfe in all perplexities, so oft as he in his need shall seek it of God; for in dubious cases, <hi>God shall teach him in the way that he shall chuse.</hi> 3. Albeit the believer be put to trouble, and hard exercise, yet shall he have place alwayes with God, as a man reconciled to him, and peace in his conscience also, as his good doth require, and he shall have contentment in his lot; for, <hi>his soule shall dwel at ease.</hi> 4. The surest way to transmit inheritances to a mans children, and to make houses to stand, and however matters go, for a man to be sure of the Kingdome of Heaven, (sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by an inheritance in the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi>) is, that the parents fear God, and that the children do follow their footsteps, and fear God also; <hi>For the seed of the man fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring God shall inherit the Land.</hi> 5. The man that feareth God, shall know more of Gods mind then others shall; he shall know the good and acceptable will of God for his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection in dangerous controversies, and for his satisfaction a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Gods dispensations, both toward himselfe, and others, and for his consolation in all afflictions; For <hi>the secret of the Lord is with them that fear him.</hi> 6. Albeit the Lords co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with the visible Church be open, and plain in it self to all men, in all the Articles thereof, yea it is a mystery to know the inward sweet fellowship which a soule may have with God, by vertue of this covenant<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> And a man fearing God, shall know this mystery, when such as are covenanters onely in the letter, do remain ignorant thereof; For <hi>to the fearers of God onely</hi> is this promise made, That <hi>to them the Lord will shew his Covenant.</hi>

                  <hi>15.</hi> Mine eyes <hi>are</hi> ever toward the Lord, and he shall pluck, my feet out of the net.</q>
               <p>Having laid the ground of his reason in the former verses, which is in summe this, To every believer God will be graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as his need is: now he assumeth, I am a believer; <hi>For mine eyes are ever toward the Lord.</hi> Therefore to me God will be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in my need, and so <hi>pluck my feet out of the net,</hi> as my need now requireth. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The believer can read his own name, and his own blessednesse in the promises made to believers, and can draw out the extract of Gods decree of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:41635:80"/>
direction, consolation, and salvation in his own fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours; for where the generall is written, there all the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars are also written in effect: And so the beleever may read his name written in the book of life, as here <hi>David</hi> doth read his own deliverance, in the Charter of Beleevers; <hi>Mine eyes are ever towards the Lord, therefore he will pluck my feet out of the net.</hi> 2. The beleever is not a little helped to beleeve, and to draw sweet conclusions from inspired Scripture, to strengthen himself by avowing himself to be a beleever, or to have the true proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a beleever, as here <hi>David</hi> doth, saying, <hi>Mine eyes are ever toward the Lord</hi>; First, he avoweth his Faith, and then draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this conclusion from it, <hi>he shall pluck my feet out of the net.</hi> 3. To depend on God, for the supply of all necessities, and for deliverance out of all straits, is the property of true Faith; for the Prophet to prove himselfe a beleever, and to have an interest in the mercies formerly set down, <hi>ver.</hi> 12, 13, 14 he saith, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. <hi>Mine eyes are ever toward the Lord.</hi> 4. Though the godly walke among snares, and nets, set by their enemies, bodily and spirituall to entrap them, yet God will either direct their way, to eschue these snares and nets, or will pluck their feet out of them; For this is the Prophets comfort, <hi>Thou shalt pluck my feet out of the net.</hi>

Naturall sense and suggestion of Satan, saith, that God doth turne his back on us, when he doth not sensibly by outward workes shew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe for us as we could wish; But Faith maketh advantage of the tentation, by adhering to God in time of a seeming deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and prayeth for his manifesting of himselfe unto us; <hi>Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me.</hi> 2.

for a time unjustly in their cause and name, so born down with calumnies by Judges and others, that they must content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with the approbation of God, and of their own conscience, as <hi>David</hi> doth here. 2. When no remedy is seen on earth for Gods oppressed children, remedy may be had from God, the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Judge, who can redresse all matters abundantly. This did <hi>David,</hi> when he said, <hi>Iudg me, O Lord</hi>: that is, do the part of a just Judg to me, in this controversie between my adversaries and me. 3.

               <p>The second part of the testimony of his conscience, that he hath rejected the course of wicked men, and their ill counsel, and that he would neither follow the way against his enemies, which they followed against him, nor hearken to the evil advice, which wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, under whatsoever pretence of good wil to him, did offer to him, for a sinful transaction, or private revenge. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1 Though innocency may seem to make the godly a prey to their enemy, yet it wil promote their cause more before God, and give greater contentment to the conscience, then witty wicked plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

               <p>THe grounds of strengthening of his Faith are three.

When we are to wrestle in prayer, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the doubts, which trouble and tentation may raise in our hearts to mar our confidence in prayer; It is wisdome to arm
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:41635:84"/>
our selves by faith against these doubts, before we pray, for so doth the Prophets example teach us. 2. He who is in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, hath solid ground to expect from God, directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and comfort in every trouble, and deliverance out of it; for by vertue of the Covenant of grace <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>The Lord is my light and my salvation.</hi> 3. When we have fastned our faith on God, we may then with reason defie our enemies, and say with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>of whom shall I be afraid?</hi> 4. When our enemies do appear strong, and we know our selves to be but weak, we should oppose the Lords strength to our tentation, that we may resist all fear; for so teacheth <hi>David, The Lord is the strength of my life, of whom shal I be afraid?</hi>

               <p>The next ground of confidence is, that he hath proofe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the fruit of the Covenant, when he was in greatest danger to be overtaken by his enemies. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. When the rage of the wicked against the godly doth break forth, then no lesse then the precious life of the godly can satisfie their beast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cruelty; they hunger even to <hi>eate their flesh.</hi> 2. God can ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily make the wicked in their hottest pursuit of the godly, to come short of their purpose, as here, <hi>to stumble and fall.</hi> 3. Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Gods power is very forcible to confirm our faith, and to erect our hope, as it did <hi>Davids</hi> faith.</p>

                  <g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 1. It is a means to strengthen faith, to resolve by the grace of God to put faith in act, in whatsoever difficulty, and in a manner to lay hands on our selves, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>A third ground of confidence, is the conscience of his purpose to studie to have constant communion with God, in the use of the means, and the conscience of his very earnest desire to have the benefit of all the publick ordinances, in the fellowship of the Church. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Hearty resolution to subject our selves to all Gods ordinances, and to follow the appointed means of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion-keeping with God, is a sound mark of solid faith, and the conscience of this resolution, serveth much to confirme our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in God, If we can say with the Prophet, <hi>This one thing have I desired, &amp;c.</hi> 2. In the using of the means and ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Gods house, the glory of the Lord may be seen, counsel, and direction in all things may be had with comfort and spiritual delight to our souls; for in the ordinances <hi>David</hi> was to <hi>behold the beauty of the Lord,</hi> with delight, <hi>and to enquire in his holy Temple.</hi> 3. The desire of communion with God, and love to his ordinances, where it is sincere, should have the chief place in the heart, above all earthly desires and delights whatsoever. <hi>One thing have I desired.</hi> 4. A sincere desire must not be suffered to go away, but should be pursued resolutely, and recommended to God daily. <hi>This I wil stil seek after,</hi> saith he: and the means of communion with God in the publick fellowship of the Church must be constantly continued in, <hi>even all the dayes of our life.</hi>

               <p>He giveth a reason of his so earnest a desire to have fellowship with God, entertained by the use of all Gods ordinances, because in this way he was sure that faith should draw all necessary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and protection from God, as need should require. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Faith keeping communion with God, findeth him all-sufficient in all necessities, to supply every inlack of the creature, where the believer standeth in need; <hi>He wil be a pavilion in war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, and a hiding place, and a rock of refuge</hi>: that is, God wil make a man as quiet by faith, in himself, as if there were no hazard; <hi>In the time of trouble he shal hide me in his pavilion: In the secret of his Tabernacle, shal be hide me, he shall set me up upon a rock.</hi>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:41635:85"/>
2. The godly cannot promise to themselves the influence of Gods grace in time of need, otherwaies then by following di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ordinances, both private and publick, so far as they may be had; for the Prophet promiseth to himself this protection, as a fruit of his faith, fostered by the use of the ordinances. I desire saith he, <hi>to dwel in thy house, and to enquire in thy holy Temple; for in the time of trouble he shal hide me, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>After this wrestling of faith, he obtaineth victory, and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of satisfaction to his desire, and the grant of all that he was to seek in his Prayer. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> The Lord can give a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever assurance of what he would have, and make him so clear of the possession of the Promise, as if it were in his hand, as here the Psalmist is sure to prevail over his enemies, sure to come to the Temple even as he wished, <hi>And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies, I will offer sacrifices of joy in his Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.</hi>

               </q>
               <p>In the second place, having thus strengthened his faith, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth the lists with his present trouble and tentations, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countreth them by Prayer to God upon the foresaid grounds, in three Petitions. In the first he prayeth for the sensible experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Gods favour, as his present condition required; wherein he strengthens his faith by three considerations. The first is, because he had gotten grace to close with the Word of God<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting him to seek what he sought, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in God, is diligent in Prayer, and despiseth not the means, whereby the mercy hoped for, may be brought about; But by Prayer it maketh particular application of the Lords good wil offered to all, unto it self; that it may be helped in the present need, as here <hi>David</hi> doth, <hi>Hear me when I cry, have mercy on me, answer me.</hi> 2. As the Lords Word encourageth us to seek things of God, which without a warrant we durst not seek; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>o
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:41635:85"/>
when we have gotten grace to embrace Gods warrant given to us by Precept or Promise, we may ask with confidence to obtain; <hi>Hear me, answer me,</hi> why? <hi>When thou saidest, Seek ye my face; my heart answered, I will seek thy face, O Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Ver. 9.</hi> Hide not thy face far from me, put not thy servant away in anger: thou hast been my help, leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</q>
               <p>He meets here with an objection from his sins and mis-deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings, and prayeth it down, adding another consideration to confirm his faith from by-gone experience of mercy, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding of his unworthinesse. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Though (when we would draw near to the Lord) sense of sin and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse, and fear of wrath do flee in our throat, yet faith clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to Gods goodnesse, and to the promises of mercy, and to our relation unto our God, may cry down the tentation, <hi>Hide not thy face, put not away thy servant in anger.</hi> 2. The former experinces which we have had of Gods being gracious to us, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the tenor of the Covenant of salvation, should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme our faith, that God will never cast us off, nor any man that cannot endure to be separate from him: Thus <hi>David</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, <hi>Thou hast been my help, leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation.</hi>

                  <hi>Ver. 10.</hi> When my father and my mother for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake me, then the Lord will take me up.</q>
               <p>A third consideration to confirm <hi>Davids</hi> faith, is a nearer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation between God and <hi>David,</hi> then between <hi>David</hi> and his Parents. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> The bands between God and a believing soul, are more strait and intimate, and more strong, then any band civil or natural between him and any creature; and they are appointed to hold fast when natural bands do fail, as here is asserted. <hi>When my father and my mother forsake me, then the Lord will take me up.</hi> This is for the first petition.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Ver. 11.</hi> Teach me thy way, O Lord, and lead me into a plain path, because of mine enemies.</q>
               <p>The second petition is for Direction in a holy and wise car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, that his enemies get no advantage against his behaviour or person. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. There is danger of desertion, or of Gods leaving us to the will of our enemies, if we carry not a good cause in a lawful, holy, tender way; and therefore we had
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:41635:86"/>
need to seek our direction from God, <hi>to be taught in his way, and led in a plaine path.</hi> 2. Because the enemies of the godly are ready to calumniate their cause, and their intentions, and to take advantage to calumniate them upon the least occasion of a questionable practice, we had the more need to be circumspect, and to pray to be directed <hi>in a plaine path, because of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Ver. 12.</hi> Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies: for false witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out cruelty.</q>
               <p>The third petition is, to be delivered from the power of the enemy, prosecuting their false calumnies, and raging in cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The godly have reason to pray with sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, that they may not fall in the hands of men because of their cruelty, and to say to God, <hi>Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemy.</hi> 2. Because it is easie for the Lord to mitigate the enemies fury, or to break their power, or to elude their craft and power<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Let us pray, <hi>Deliver,</hi> and let God chuse the way of delivery. 3. When the good cause of the godly, and the persons also are left to suffer both together, there is ground that God in that case will interpose himself in due time: for this is <hi>Davids</hi> reason of hope to be helped, because false witnesses resolved to oppresse him in name, and <hi>breathers out of cruelty,</hi> were set to have his life, ever <hi>rising against him</hi>: and here he is a clear type and example of the suffering of Christ, and his followers.</p>

               <p>In the third place he cometh to shew, and to make use of the benefit he had by beleeving, that he may encourage others to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his example in their tryals. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under trouble, is a sort of quitting of our cause, and of all comfort in it; but faith keepeth a man close to his cause, and from being overcome with troubles; it holds up his heart in his duty, till the Lord send an out-gate, wherein he were not able to subsist otherwise: <hi>Unlesse I had believed, I had fainted.</hi> 2. Our expriences of the good of believing in the time of
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:41635:86"/>
straites, should be communicated to others, as our calling may suffer to encourage them, for so doth the Prophet, saying, <hi>Wait on the Lord, and be of good courage.</hi> 3. The striving to take cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage from the ground of faith, shall be followed with strength from God to go under the trouble, and to finde comfort now and then, and full delivery at last: <hi>He shall comfort thy heart.</hi> 4. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the Lord let the trouble lie on, and strong tentations to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, and griefe of heart to grow, yet must we still wait; for at the due time, the out-gate shall come, <hi>Wait I say, on the Lord.</hi>

great in the world, so they are ready to think much of their own strength, of what their power is able to reach to, and what honour is due to them; but if they reckon right, <hi>strength and glory belongeth to God.</hi> And according as he is above them in power and excellency, so should he proportionably be magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, <hi>Give unto the Lord glory and strength, and give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name.</hi> 4. He will have no glory of men, but as he hath prescribed to men in his own ordinances, given forth in his Word to his Church: <hi>Worship him in the beauty of holinesse,</hi> that is, in the glorious sanctuary, the place of publick meeting; beautiful indeed, not for timber or stones so much, as because the holy and beautiful means of grace to men, and Gods worship shewing forth his glory was there to be found.</p>

Though the standing works of Creation speak most of God, yet such is our foolishnesse, that we are least apprehensive of that which is daily seen, and a lesse work more rarely occurring will move more; as for example, the thunder or the Eclipse of the Sun or Moon, will move more then the making of heaven and earth. 2. No work of the Lord is right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken up till he himself be looked unto, as the immediate Worker of it: therefore he points out the sound of the thunder, as <hi>the voice of the Lord upon many waters.</hi> 3. Though the Lord should be observed as the worker of every work, yet not at first is he seen in his work to any purpose, till we by oftner review<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his operation about it, be somewhat affected with his glory and power therein; therefore he repeateth the second time, <hi>The God of glory thundreth</hi>; And the third time, <hi>The Lord is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on many waters.</hi> 4. When the thunder or any work of God is well considered, some invisible thing of God will appear therein; as for example, his power and majesty will be evidenced in the

One work of God dwelt upon, shal shew more of God then many of his works being slightly looked on, and passed over: as for example, this one of the thunder, considered with the effects, saith more then many; yea, one sensible and understanding man, wil disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more of God in one work of God, then many in their ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mood, either in that work, or in any other, or in all his works.</p>

               <p>He giveth a second reason of his exhortation to the mighty, <hi>to worship God in the beauty of holinesse,</hi> because in his Temple every one doth speak of his glory. <hi>Whence learne,</hi> 1. The glory of the Lord is shewn forth in all the earth, and in all his works, but in his Temple, in his Church, his works are holden forth expresly and fully, for there by his Word, his counsel is open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, his holinesse, his goodnesse, justice, mercy, and all his
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:41635:91"/>
attributes are declared. Without the Church, men are compelled to acknowledg glory now and then, but in his Church, men do declare his glory distinctly and willingly. <hi>In his Temple doth every one speak of his glory,</hi> all men there do confesse his praise, and every thing in the Temple holdeth forth something of Christ and his benefits, to the glory of Gods mercy; and this is more then the world understandeth.</p>

               <p>A third reason, to move Princes to give to God glory and strength, is, because his Kingdome reacheth to the ruling of the waters, and because he is a King immortal. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. As the strength of the Lord appeareth in all his works, so especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that he ruleth the raging sea, whereby once he did drown the world, and now bindeth up, that it should do no more so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>The Lord sitteth upon the floods.</hi> No King is King over every Kingdom and King, but God is King above all Kings; No King is of long continuance, but the Lord is the everlasting King, <hi>He sitteth King for ever</hi>; and therefore every mighty man should do him homage, as his King, his Lord, and supreme Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour.</p>

               <p>The last reason to move Potentates to give all glory to God, and to joyne with his People in glorifying of him, is, because of the blessednesse of his people, who worship him in his holy Temple. <hi>Whence learne,</hi> 1. The power of the Lord is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his people, but for his people, against his and their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, <hi>He giveth strength to his People,</hi> to wit, against their enemies, and for furnishing them to every part of his service whereunto he calleth them; The Lords people do give the glory of power and strength to the Lord, <hi>And the Lord wil give strength to his People.</hi> 2.

Thirdly, he confesseth his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal security, and how hee was corrected for it, <hi>ver.</hi> 6<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 7.

               </argument>
               <p>THe Inscription of the Psalme sheweth, that it was endited at the dedication of <hi>Davids</hi> house, after it was polluted by <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saloms</hi> vilenesse with his fathers Concubines, as <hi>Davids</hi> securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and trouble after that herein described, giveth us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. That no benefit or creature-comfort is lawful and pure to us, except it be sanctified by the Word and Prayer, except we dedicate our selves and the creatures also to Gods service; and more specially the dedication of a mans house with the Ceremonies of the law, used about the dedication thereof, teacheth us to consider and to ackdowledge before God, That we are the Lords Tenants at will, received by him in his lodgings, to be entertained by him during our abode on earth; It teacheth us also that our houses should be holy, both for the Persons in our company, and for the exercise of Religion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in daily, before and after our lawful daily refreshments and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments therein; and that the Lord only is the Preserver of us, and of our houses, against what evil might otherwaies befall us, by men or divels, or any other accident; and that the house is polluted, especially when God is openly dishonored therein: in which case we are to seek mercy to our selves, and to our fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and to pray to God for the continuance of his guard about us, and his grace, to make a right use of our house hereafter, which is the substance of the old Ceremonies used <hi>in dedication of a mans house.</hi>

               </q>
               <p>HE praiseth God for a number of mercies concurring toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his deliverance, out of the hazard of losing both his life and his Kingdome. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The more the Lord exalts us, we should humble our selves the more before him, and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie his bounty: for <hi>David wil extol the Lord,</hi> here, <hi>because the Lord had lifted him up.</hi> 2. The disappointment of our enemies is a new mercy, beside our delivery from their cruelty, and a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of thansgiving to God, when he makes our foes not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce oyer us. 3. When God seemeth to desert us, and expose us to hazards; readily our spirits grow sick, and deadnesse of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, (with inability to go about any point in our calling, or of his service) do seise on us; but when after the prayer of faith grounded on the Covenant, the Lord sendeth relief, it is a reviving of us again, as we see in <hi>Davids</hi> case, <hi>O my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me.</hi> 4. Preservation from evil, and delivery out of evil are mercies equivalent; rescuing a man from instant death, should be looked upon as resurrection from death, and acknowledged so to be in our thanksgiving to God; for <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> here saith, <hi>The Lord hath brought up his soul from the grave, because he had kept him alive, that he should not go down into the pit.</hi>

               </q>
               <p>The second part of the Psalme, wherein he stirreth up o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to praise God for his mercies. <hi>Whence learne,</hi> 1. Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a while upon the consideration of mercies shewn unto us, bringeth with it rejoycing in God, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> singing disposition,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:41635:92"/>
whereunto when we are once wakened and warmed, we will think that one mouth to praise God is too little, as here we see in <hi>David,</hi> who not only praiseth God himself but also setteth all the Saints on work to the same purpose, saying, <hi>Sing to the Lord all ye Saints of his.</hi> 2. Albeit we had no present sense of lately received remarkable mercies, yet by-gone experiences of the Lords faithfulness and holiness, should give matter of thanks and praise, on all occasions, specially in the Congregation, where his works are called to mind: <hi>Give thanks,</hi> saith he, <hi>at the remembrance of his holinesse.</hi> 3. Albeit we were not upon the thoughts of any particular experience, yet the knowne perfections of God should furnish matter, and in special, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause howsoever we be sinful, and do provoke the Lord often, yet he, <hi>as he is slow to anger,</hi> so is he soon pacified, <hi>his anger en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth but for a moment.</hi> 4. When reckoning is rightly made, the tokens of Gods displeasure are but for a <hi>moment.</hi> But the evidence of his favours to believers is a life-time, for in the midst of wrath he remembreth mercy; and the tokens of his favour, are farre more then of his displeasure, and wrath soone goeth, and favour shineth latest, and is of longest continuance; Wrath is but temporary at the longest, but favour endureth for ever: <hi>His anger is but for a moment, but in his favour is life, yea life everlasting.</hi> 5. When the Lord sheweth himself angry at a soul, it is dark and cold night with it, and what can it do, but weep or walk heavily in this case, when the bridegroom is as absent? <hi>Weeping may abide for a night.</hi> 6. Unto the believer the longest winter-night hath a change to the better following it: consolation is certain after a mournful condition; <hi>Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.</hi>

                     <hi>7.</hi> Lord, by thy favour thou hadst made my mountain to stand strong: Thou didst hide thy face <hi>and</hi> I was troubled.</p>
               </q>
               <p>In the third place, he cometh to his late experience, which gave occasion and matter of this Psalm; he abused his prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, not remembring that because his standing was by grace therefore he should have stood in awe, and feared to forget him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and therefore he was chastised for it. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. A child of God, after long trouble may have a time of outward rest and prosperity; for example, <hi>David,</hi> whose troubles were many, doth
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:41635:93"/>
acknowledge here that he was in prosperity. 2. As men in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ouble do fear they shal never be rid of it, so when God granteth a change to the better, they think never to be so troubled again; This fleshly security is a soul sicknesse, attending prosperity, and the most holy men may easily be overtaken with it; for <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> confesseth, <hi>I said in my prosperity, I shal never be moved.</hi> 3. The consideration that our standing in any good condition, is of Gods meer favour and grace, should keep us in fear and trembling to offend, and prevent our falling in carnal security. This <hi>David</hi> acknowledgeth for aggravating of his fault, <hi>Lord, by thy favour thou hadst made my mountain strong.</hi> 4. The Lord wil not suffer his own to lie stil in carnal security, but wil withdraw the bolster and pillow of those benefits whereon they do sleepe, and together with that, wil withdraw also the sweet sense of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, and put his owne in trouble to waken them: <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> experience teacheth so much, <hi>Thou didst hide thy face, and I was troubled.</hi> 5. Men understand the folly of their sinful way, and of their carelesse entertaining of Gods favour, not so wel in the time of prosperity, as after they have smarted for their folly, and have found the fruit of their forgetfulnesse of God, and of their too much embracing and resting on prosperity to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, save sore and sad troubles, both bodily, and spiritual; for this is taught us by the reckoning that <hi>David</hi> now maketh, as a Pilot, discovering a rock, to forwarn others to beware of security; and this reckoning is all after his trouble, and after his victory al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so over it.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver. 8.</hi> I cryed to thee, O Lord, and unto the Lord I made supplication.</p>

               </q>
               <p>In the fourth part of this Psalme he sheweth his recovery out of his trouble, and out of his sinful security which drew it on; he prayed, disputed and dealt with God, til the Lord delivered him. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. As the fire and the hammer, and the files do serve to put off the rust off iron, so doth affliction to rouse a godly soul out of security, and drive him to earnest Prayer; for after trouble is come, <hi>David cryed to the Lord.</hi> 2. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit a man hath miscarried, and proved ungrateful to God in
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:41635:93"/>
his prosperity, and unmindful of his resolutions and promises made to God in his low estate, when he should come to prosperity; yet when trouble cometh to waken him up, and cal him to a reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning, he must not despaire, nor set downe in discouragement in the conscience of huge guiltinesse. But because the Lord is angry, and no remedy but Gods grace, he must lay himself at Gods feet a supplicant: <hi>Unto the Lord</hi> David <hi>made supplication.</hi> 3. Faith in God is very argumentative, and wil dispute wel for the mans life, having the Covenant of grace as a ground to go upon; It wil take a reason to strengthen it selfe from Gods nature, who doth not delight in the death of a penitent sinner, and a reason from no advantage unto justice, by the mans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, when justice may have satisfaction in the Redeemer, and the man may be saved also; <hi>What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit?</hi> and a reason from the mans pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to glorifie God, to the edifying of others in his life, if he should be spared: from which mercy if he should be cut off, it would be more bitter to him then death; <hi>Shal the dust praise thee? Shall it declare thy truth?</hi> 4. When faith hath said to God that it hath to say, it wil wait for a good answer, wil relie on his mercy, and expect relief from the Lord, as here <hi>David</hi> doth, <hi>Hear, O Lord, have mercy on me, be thou my helper.</hi>

               </q>
               <p>In the last part of the Psalm he thankfully praiseth God, for granting unto him all he desired, and obligeth himself to a more careful carriage, and setting forth of Gods glory. <hi>Whence learne,</hi> 1. It becometh the child of God to weep when he is beaten, and to humble himself in the exercise of Prayer, and Fasting; for <hi>Davids mourning</hi> and <hi>sack-cloth,</hi> sheweth his exercise in his former trouble. 2. As security turneth all our joy into trouble, so sincere seeking of God in trouble, is the way to turn all our trouble into joy, <hi>Thou hast turned for me all my mourning into dancing, &amp;c.</hi> and great is that joy which a reconciled soul findeth in God, after renewed feeling of the interrupted sense of mercy. 3. A well ordered tongue, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

all opportunities to glorifie God, and edifie others, is a main point of a mans excellency, not only above beasts, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so above all men, who do not use their tongue for God, and for good to others; Therefore <hi>David</hi> calleth his tongue <hi>his glory.</hi> 4. The very intent of Gods shewing mercy to men, is to oblige them to give praise and glory to himself before the world, <hi>thou hast girded me with gladnesse,</hi> saith he, <hi>To the end my glory may sing praise to thee, and not be silent.</hi> 5. The right use of our experiences of Gods mercy to us, is first to fasten our faith in God, and to stand fast to the Lords Covenant, made with us in Christ; next after acknowledging that this is our duty, to be thankful to God, to engage our hearts to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge thereof constantly: The first of these the Prophet doth here by calling God, <hi>The Lord my God</hi>; the next he doth in these words, <hi>I wil give thanks to thee for ever.</hi>

Faith avowed and maintained, furnisheth prayer, and giveth hope to be heard; for <hi>David</hi> having first said, <hi>In thee, O Lord, do I put my trust</hi>; he subjoyneth, <hi>Let me never be ashamed</hi>: For this much may a believer expect, that albeit he be put to hang down the head for a little, yet he shall not at last be ashamed. 2.

               <p>He cometh more particularly to his danger, and prayeth for deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and strengthening his faith by sundry reasons. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. As the children of this world are more wise in their genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then the children of the light: so do they hunt and overtake the godly, by their crafty devices against him, <hi>They laid their nets privily against</hi> David, <hi>and ensnared him.</hi> 2. Though the godly be both weak and simple-witted, yet they have a wise and strong God to call upon, who is able to break the snare, and set his own free, whose help <hi>David</hi> imploreth here, <hi>Pull me out of the net,</hi> for thou art my strength. 3. The way to quiet our mindes, in the hazard of our mortal life, (which is soon and easily taken away, and we cannot our selves preserve,) is to put our soul over on Gods care and custody, <hi>Into his hands committing our spirits.</hi> 4. The Word of God, giving assurance to the believer of his Redemption, is a ground sufficient, to make him confidently commit his soul to Gods keeping; for he may say with warrant, <hi>Thou hast redeemed me, O God of truth.</hi> 5. Worldly men that believe not in God, have some other thing wherein they trust beside, as riches, friendship, their own wit, &amp;c. which carnal confidences are but lying vanities, whereof the true believer must be aware, and hate the way of such as follow them; for <hi>David</hi> hated them that <hi>regarded ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vanities, because he trusted in God.</hi>

In the midst of trouble faith will furnish matter of joy, and promise to it self gladnesse, especially from the memory of by-past ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences of Gods mercy; as here, <hi>I will rejoyce and be glad in thy mercy.</hi> 2. When a believer is in adversity, the Lord will

not misken him, he will make him know, that even then he hath an eye upon him, and friendly affections to him: <hi>Thou hast known my soul in adversity.</hi> 3. Adversary power shall not get their will of a fixed believer, but he shall have delivery from them, and victory over them, either temporally or spiritually, or both ways; for here is the experience of it, <hi>Thou hast not shut me up in the hand of the enemy, thou hast set my feet in a large room.</hi> 4. The ground of our gladnesse, when we have found a proof of Gods kindnesse to us, should not be in the benefit so much, as in the fountain of the benefit; for this giveth us hope to drink again of the like experience, from the fountain which did send forth that benefit. Therefore <hi>David</hi> sayes, <hi>I will be glad and rejoyce in thy mercy for ever.</hi>

               </q>
               <p>In the third place he layeth out his lamentable condition, in regard of perplexity of minde, and decay of natural strength, by grief and sorrow of heart, and in regard of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of his adversaries, and neglect of his friends, and hazard of his life joyned with the sense of Gods displeasure for his sinnes, wherein he is a type of Christ suffering for our sinnes imputed to him, and an example of the hard exercise of the Saints<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 
                  <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Great and of long continuance may the troubles of the godly be, great may their grief and heavinesse of heart be, before they get comfort, as the example of this meek man, so holy in his
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:41635:96"/>
way, so subdued in his affections, doth shew by sundry expressions. 2. Albeit the Lord needs no words to informe him of our condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or to move his affection to his children in trouble, yet he hath appointed us for evidencing our faith in him, and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon him for relief, to come and tell him what aileth us; and indeed it is an ease to the godly heart, to have the Lord to speak unto, and lay out their case before him, as here we see. 3. The conscience of sinne joyned with trouble, is a load above a burden, and able to break a mans strength more then any trouble; for here he saith, <hi>my strength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are consumed.</hi> 4. When the godly have many and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full enemies, then their acquaintance and neighbours, and the multitude of the people will readily believe that all misreports of them are true, and this maketh the grief of the godly the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; as here, <hi>I was a reproach among all mine enemies, but specially among my neighbours.</hi> 5. When the godly fall under persecution and trouble, their worldly friends for fear of danger, or burden by them, will turn their back on them, and forget acquaintance, yea and natural bands with them also; and then must the godly lean to God, and expect comfort from him. This is holden forth in this type of Christ, and example of believers under tryall; <hi>I am a fear to my acquaintance,</hi> &amp;c. 6. Long lying in trouble will make a man to be forgotten of his friends, as if he were dead, and make him to lose all estimation at their hands, as if there were no worth in him at all. <hi>I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind, I am like a broken vessel.</hi> 7. It is Satans policy to draw great men and Councellors of State in tops with the godly, because common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what great men esteem of the godly, that passeth for currant; and it is Satans policy first to laden the godly with slanders, and then to persecute them to death, <hi>I heard the slanders of many, they took counsell together to take away my life.</hi> 8. In a sharp triall a soul may be assulted with terrible tentations on all hands, and feel terror and fighting within and without, <hi>fear,</hi> saith he, <hi>was on every side.</hi>
               </p>

                     <hi>16.</hi> Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me for thy mercies sake.</p>

                     <hi>17.</hi> Let me not be ashamed, O Lord, for I have cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon thee: let the wicked be ashamed, and let them be silent in the grave.</p>

                     <hi>18.</hi> Let the lying lips be put to silence, which speak grievous things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous.</p>
               </q>
               <p>In the fourth place he wrestles by faith for delivery, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in the mean time till delivery come to himself, and disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment to his enemies. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. It is the nature of faith, and it is the believers duty, to oppose help from God, unto all tentations, were they never so many; as here <hi>David</hi> did. <hi>But I trusted in thee, O Lord.</hi> 2. Except we hold fast the grip of our Covenant with God, and avow it before him, trust will faile, and tentations readily prevail: much use made <hi>David</hi> of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant in his strait, <hi>I said, Thou art my God.</hi> 3. Faith can make good chear of the general grounds of Gods providence, by making application thereof to its present use. The dispensations of al mens comforts and troubles, life and death, are in Gods hand, and not in mens power: <hi>my times are in thy hand,</hi> saith <hi>David.</hi> 4. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause all power is in Gods hand, prayer to him will prevail more for delivery from enemies, then any means besides; <hi>Deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and them that persecute me.</hi> 5. When the cloud of trouble hideth the Lords favour, faith knoweth it may shine again, and therefore prayeth through the cloud for dissolving of it; <hi>make thy face to shine upon me.</hi> 6. As we must stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to approve our selves to be the Lords servants, by studying o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to him; So must we make grace and nothing else save grace, the ground of our hope to be helped, comforted, or saved. <hi>Shine upon thy servant,</hi> saith he, <hi>save me for thy mercies sake.</hi> 7. As the humble prayer of the persecuted godly, shall be granted and have effect; So the proud brags, coloured calumnies, and threatnings of slanderous and cruel adversaries, shall be shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully refuted and disappointed; and if the enemies shall not ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously cease to persecute, they shall be made to cease in their graves, <hi>Let me not be ashamed, for I have called on thee, let the wicked be ashamed, and made silent in their graves; let lying lips be put to silence, which speak grievous things proudly and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuously against the righteous.</hi>

wrought for them that trust in thee before the sonnes of men!</p>
                  <p n="20">
                     <hi>20.</hi> Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, from the pride of man: thou shalt keep them se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly in a pavilion, from the strife of tongues.</p>

                     <hi>21.</hi> Blessed <hi>be</hi> the Lord, for he hath shewed me his marvellous kindnesse in a strong City.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Comfort and deliverance being the answer of his prayer, he praiseth God, and stirreth up the godly to set their hearts on God, and trust in him at all times. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The bounty of the Lord to his own people seen in the World, observed in the Lords ordinary dispensation towards them, and felt in a mans own experience, is able to ravish the heart with admiration of the blessednesse of Gods people, as here, <hi>O! how great is thy goodnesse!</hi> 2. Beside what consolation of spirit the Lord giveth to his own, the Lord sometimes will manifest so much respect in his providence to his servants, that not only the godly, but also they who are but children of men, will be forced to acknowledge the Lords singular respect to them; and beside what the Lord bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth either inwardly or outwardly upon his own in this life, there is yet more laid up for afterwards, for compleating of the blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in the life to come: <hi>How great is thy goodnesse which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee, which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men!</hi> 3. How great peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science before God, and comfort in the holy Ghost, the Lord can give a believer when he hath to do with proud open persecuters, and privily whispering slanderers; It is a secret and hid mystery to the worldly man: this <hi>David</hi> describeth in a similitude taken from wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>fare, <hi>Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man, thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues.</hi> 4. As every believer having gotten a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny experience of Gods goodnesse, should read it as a particular proof of some generall promise made to the godly; so should he subscribe the truth of that promise, in favour of all beleevers, and blesse God for his own particular experience of it; for so doth the Prophet here, saying, <hi>He hath shewed his kindnesse to me,</hi> that is, how kinde a God he is to his own, <hi>is in a strong City</hi>; that is, preserved me in the wildernesse, as if I had been in the best fenced City in the world, furnished with men, victual and amunition in abundance.</p>

                  <hi>Ver. 22.</hi> For I said in mine haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes: Neverthelesse thou heardest the voice of my supplications, when I cried unto thee.</q>
               <p>He confesseth the great distress he was in, and how weak his faith was under the tentation; this he doth to his own shame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge also, that he may give the greater glory to God. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The faith of the godly may be shaken, and the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est faith may sometimes shew its infirmity. <hi>I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes.</hi> 2. Though faith be shaken, yet it is fixed in the root, as a tree beaten by the winde, keeping strong gripes of good ground; Though faith seem to yield, yet it fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, and even when it is at the weakest, it is uttering it self in some act, as a wrestler; for here the expression of <hi>Davids</hi> infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in faith is directed to God, and his earnest prayer joyned with it, <hi>I am cut off from before thine eyes, yet thou heardest the voice of my supplications.</hi> 3. Praying faith, how weak soever, shall not be misregarded of God; for neverthelesse saith he, <hi>thou heardest the voice of my supplication.</hi> 4. There may be in a soul at one time both grief oppressing, and hope upholding: both darknesse of trouble, and the light of faith; both desperately doubting, and strong griping of Gods truth and goodnesse; both a fainting and a fighting; a seeming yeelding in the fight, and yet a stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of faith against all opposition; both a foolish haste, and a settled stayedness of faith; as here, <hi>I said in my haste, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Now he maketh farther use of his experience, in exhorting all the godly to follow his example, encouraging them yet with hope of like success. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The gracious dealing of God with believers, should glew their own hearts, and all other Saints hearts that hear of it, unto God in faith and love. <hi>O love the Lord all ye his Saints.</hi> He putteth love for faith, because it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable from faith, and faith worketh by love, and love proveth the sincerity of faith. 2. The faithful man shall not want an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder, albeit he had no friends: <hi>for the Lord preserveth the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi> 3. The proud man shall not want a pursuer, and one to be avenged on him for his pride and oppression, though all the world

should let him alone, <hi>for the Lord doth plentifully reward the proud doer.</hi> 4. Albeit opposition be made unto a believer, yet must he resist every thing which might put him back from trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in God; for it becometh a believer to be stout; <hi>Be of good courage.</hi> 5. Who so aimeth at courage in the Lord, shall be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with strength to double out his undertaking of faith: <hi>Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart.</hi> 6.

               <p>IN the Doctrine set down in these two verses; <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. That sin draweth on a debt which no man can satisfie for: such a debt, as a man must perish, if it be <hi>not forgiven.</hi> 2. Sin is a fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse, which neither God can behold, without abominating the sinner, nor the guilty conscience can look upon without hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, except it <hi>be covered.</hi> 3. Sin draweth on a guiltinesse, which may draw men to damnation, if it shal be <hi>imputed.</hi> 4. There is no justification of a sinner by his good works before God, but only by the forgivenesse of his evil works, as the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.6, 7, 8. citing this place, proveth, <hi>Blessed is he whose trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression is forgiven.</hi> 5. Justification by faith, or remission of sins is accompanied with right unto salvation, because it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>Blessed is the man whose transgression is forgiven.</hi> 6. Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by faith, or absolution from sin, is accompanied also with the upright endeavour of sanctification; for of the justified man it is said, <hi>Blessed is the man in whose spirit there is no guile.</hi> 7. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit no man liveth and sinneth not, yet God hath a way to cleanse the conscience of the upright man; who honestly and without guile, endeavoureth to walk before God, by bringing him to give account of his debt, and to acknowledge his filthinesse, and his guiltinesse before God, and then for Christs sake <hi>forgiving him,</hi> and with Christs righteousness <hi>covering him,</hi> and for Christs me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation, <hi>not imputing iniquity unto him.</hi>

               <p>He declareth this Doctrine by his own experience, how Gods wrath never left pursuing of him, til he came to make use of this doctrine, acknowledging his sin, and fleeing to the benefit of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sin, for the blood of the Messiah, the Lamb slain from the beginning of the world, in the symbole of the expiatory sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice then daily offered for sin. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. That man is fittest to speak of the Doctrine of mans sin and misery, and of Gods free grace and mercy, who hath felt the bitternesse of sin and wrath, and the sweetnesse of Gods grace by experience of Gods pardon; therefore is this Doctrine recommended to the Church by <hi>David,</hi>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:41635:99"/>
who had felt both. 2. A justified man who knoweth the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Justification by faith in Christ, possibly, yea readily may forget to make use of this precious truth, when he hath most need of it, being under guiltinesse, and the pressure also of Gods fatherly wrath for it; for <hi>David</hi> for a while being in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, was silent, and came not off at first to seek relief the right way: for <hi>he kept silence,</hi> and did not come to the acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his sin, but was taken up only with the sense of the Rod. 3. When the Lord is about to make his child sensible of his sins, and of the necessity of a free remission of them, through the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour, he can awake the conscience of sin, by the sense of sad affliction, and can encrease the heat of the furnace, and make his child roar for sorrow and paine, and thereby weaken his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral strength, and waste his spirits and his flesh, and his bones, and drive him to deaths door, til he make use of the Doctrine of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, or remission of sin by faith in God the Redeemer; This was <hi>Davids</hi> case, <hi>when he kept silence, his bones waxed old. Gods hand was heavie upon him night and day, and the sap of his body</hi> was dried up as a piece of moist earth is dried <hi>in the drought of Summer.</hi>

               <p>At last the Lord led him to the right remedy, pointed out the way unto him of humiliation, and confession of sin, and seeking of mercy, as it is prescribed in the Word, and so he was relieved. <hi>Whence learn.</hi> 1. Before the Lord let his child go from under the Rod, after he hath given him an essay of himselfe, and of his own way how unprofitable it is, he will bring him about to the right way of relief, as here we see. 2. The only way to quiet the conscience, to pacifie wrath, and remove judgment, is ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously to confesse sin, and to aggravate it sincerely (laying aside extenuations, excuses, and subterfuges, for justifying of Gods dealing with us, and for humiliation of our own selves before him,) and to flie to Gods mercy, laying out all before him; as before a gracious God, who doth pursue controversies with his own, only to th'intent, that they may make peace with him in the Mediatour, and so be reconciled.

when we take the right way (as is said) to be delivered, for so sonne as <hi>David</hi> resolved opon this course, and said, <hi>he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse,</hi> it followeth, <hi>Thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin.</hi>

               <p>The first use of this Doctrine and of <hi>Davids</hi> experience, is to teach others how to behave themselves in their trouble. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The Doctrine of Justification by gracious forgiving iniquity, is the ground of all the godlies approaches to God, and right worshipping of him; for to shew the use of this Doctrine, thus tried by experience, he saith, <hi>Every godly one shall pray unto thee.</hi> 2. There is a time when God may be found, to wit, so long as God is offering grace, and sparing extremity of wrath, which time men ought to lay hold on, not knowing how short while it may last: They shal pray <hi>in a time when thou mayest be found.</hi> 3. It is possible, that a godly man may be in the middest of the waters of sore troubles, and yet these troubles not come near unto him, because God can furnish the man an Ark in Christ, whereby he shal swim above the deluge: and when God keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth off trouble, that is proveth not hurtful, (much more when he: maketh trouble a means of spiritual good to a man, and giveth the man true peace and contentment in himself) it is verified what is promised here, <hi>Surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come near him.</hi>

               <p>From the second use wherein <hi>David</hi> confirmeth his own faith for time to come, <hi>Learne,</hi> 1. Experience of Gods mercies by gone should fasten resolution, to make use of faith hereafter in all trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, as here. 2. The godly after one trouble, should prepare for another, after one delivery expect another, as here. 3. What God hath proved himself to be to us before, we may promise, he shal be the same to us in effect hereafter, because he is that by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and promise to us, what in practice we have found him to he; for <hi>David</hi> reasoneth thus, <hi>Thou art mine hiding place, thou shalt preserve me from trouble</hi>; that is, I shal have no dammage by trouble, as is said. 4. A justified soul resolving to make use
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:41635:100"/>
of God in every condition that can come unto him, according to the Covenant, may promise to himself a comfortable out-gate of all his troubles, and matter of praise and joy from God on all hands, yea, he may confidently say with <hi>David, Thou shalt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe me about with joyfull deliverance.</hi>

               <p>From the third use of teaching others to be wise, by his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The right use of experience is to edifie others as our calling requireth; when we are converted, we should streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then our brethren; for this <hi>David</hi> doth, <hi>I wil instruct thee, &amp;c.</hi> 2. When we have heard how others have been afflicted, we should be wiser, and take instruction by their example, that we strive not with God, but submit our selves under his hand, acknowledge our sins, and seek mercy of him: <hi>Be not as the horse or the mule.</hi> 3. Whosoever wil not submit unto God, and seek unto his favour, shal find themselves so much the more hardly dealt with, as horses and mules <hi>are bound in with bit and bridle.</hi>

There is no advantage to be had by repining against God, only the multiplication of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows shal follow thereupon, sin upon sin, wrath upon wrath, judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon judgement; and after temporal evils, everlasting shal follow, <hi>for many sorrowes shall be to the wicked.</hi> 2. Not repining against God, taking with our chastisements, acknowledging of our sins in our affliction; seeking in to Gods mercy, and leaning unto him, putteth difference between the wicked and the godly; for here the believer is set in opposition to the wicked, and to the man that is like a horse or mule; for he is called <hi>the man that trusteth in the Lord.</hi> 3. Whatsoever tentation, trouble, or oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition shal make assault against the believer; mercy shal make

               <p>From the last use of making God our joy and delight; <hi>Learne,</hi> 1. Such as understand the way of Justification by grace, and have fled to God for pardon of sin, and so are justified, have great matter of rejoycing, and should make conscience to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in God: for to them it is said, <hi>Rejoyce ye righteous.</hi> 2. The justified man is no counterfeit in the matter of Religion, nor hypocrite in the matter of outward obedience to the Lords Law, <hi>He is a righteous man, he is upright in heart.</hi> 3. The matter of his joy and triumphing is the Lord himself, his grace, his good wil, his Covenant, his promise, and constant kindnesse and mercy, for it is said to them, <hi>Be glad in the Lord.</hi>

               <p>In the third place he sheweth the blessednesse of Gods people, in order to his praise who hath chosen them, and who doth dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of all things to their behoof. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Of all the people on the earth, the Lord hath only entred in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with his Church, to be their God in a peculiar way; for here, <hi>There is a Nation whose God is the Lord.</hi> 2. Such as do lay hold on God as their God, are the only blessed people in the world; for it is said, <hi>Blessed is that Nation, whose God is the Lord,</hi> 3. Such as in the sense of their own sin and misery, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the vanity of all things beside God, have chosen God for their God, to live in Communion with him, they have evidence of their Election; for they are here called, <hi>The people whom he hath chosen.</hi> 4. Such people, as is said, are that peculiar portion of the world, which God hath set apart for himself to draw the rent of his glory in the world by them, and from them in a special way; and whom he will keep in his possession for ever, and not suffer himself to be bereft of them; <hi>For they are the People whom he hath chosen for his inheritance.</hi> 5. Though the Church be the only inheritance of God, yet the rest of the world is the object of his wise, holy and powerful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, no lesse then the Church: <hi>The Lord looketh down from heaven, and beholds all the sonnes of men.</hi> 6. There cannot be a plot on earth against Gods Church: but God is privy to it, and knoweth it perfectly; for <hi>from the place of his habitation, he looketh on all the inhabitants of the earth.</hi> 7. The Lord cannot be ignorant of the most secret device of men, better or worse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is the Maker of the hearts of all men, <hi>He fashioneth their hearts alike,</hi> (that is, the heart of one as well as of another) <hi>he considereth all their works,</hi> that he may make of them what he will. 8.

Trusting in means, (such as a mans strength, and the assistance of other men, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creatures,) is an errour so natural, and fixed, as it had need to be refuted by God, who hath said, that they are a vaine confidence to lean unto, which cannot deliver a man, <hi>There is no King saved by the multitude of an hoste, a mighty man is not delivered by much strength, and a horse is a vain thing for safety</hi>: And the actuall frustrating of mens hopes, to be helped by authority, strength, or external helpes, should teach men not to lean to them, when they are making use of them. 2. The man that believeth in God, and feareth him, is in a more safe condition, then the wicked in all their power and riches: <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him, and hope in his mercy, to deliver them.</hi> 3.

                  <p>In this Psalme <hi>David</hi> praiseth God, for his delivery from the King of <hi>Gath,</hi> and exhorteth others to praise God with him, for his experience of Gods mercy, <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

               <p>He is glad, and commendeth Gods goodnesse to him for the fruit of this mercy to other believers. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. One mans experience may be an encouragement to many, to run to God for the like alms. This <hi>David</hi> foreseeth shall be the fruit of Gods mercy to him, when men seeing him delivered, shall look to God, and take comfort, and confidence by this means. <hi>They looked on him,</hi> that is, on <hi>David,</hi> and so may we on Christ (represented by him) and at the fulnesse of the Godhead dwelling in Christ; So they were lightened, and thus comforted in the middest of the darknesse of their troubles: <hi>and their faces were not ashamed</hi>; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of confidence raised by this experience, that they should find the like mercy, when they stood in need. 2. The way to make best use of the example of Gods mercy to any person set down in Scripture, or which fall forth in our time, or are made certainly known to us any way, is to look upon them, not as they differ from us or our condition, but as they draw nearest in simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude to us, and unto the mean condition we are in, for so do the Saints look on <hi>David,</hi> saying, Not this rare Saint <hi>David,</hi> or this great Prophet <hi>David,</hi> or this holy man <hi>David,</hi> who was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods heart; <hi>but this poor man</hi> David <hi>cried, and the Lord heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles.</hi>

               <p>In the next place are set down general Doctrines concerning Gods care of believers, to protect and feed them; and the uses thereof; To trust and fear God. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. A right sight of Gods dealing with a mans own self, will give him great light about the Lords manner of dealing with others, his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:41635:105"/>
as here. 2. Though the Godly walk among foes, and be in a continual warfare, yet they are well looked to and guarded. <hi>The Angel of the Lord encampeth round about them.</hi> 3. The sense of Gods mercy and goodnesse, is the sweetest thing that ever was felt, and is able to season the bitterest cup that ever believer drank of: <hi>Taste and see that the Lord is good.</hi> 4. By faith is the taste of this sweetnesse gotten: <hi>for blessed is the man that trusts in him.</hi> 5. All that the believer can attain to in this life of spiritual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation, whether by faith or experience sweetened with lively comforts of the holy Ghost, is but a taste in comparison of what is to be had hereafter, and yet that taste, O how sweet a joy, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable and full of glory is it! <hi>O taste and see that the Lord is good.</hi> 6. Affliction purgeth the taste of the believer, and a soul driven from all worldly helps, but fitted for exercising spiritual senses, as here we see, <hi>Davids</hi> taste is purged well after trouble. 7. As God is very communicative of his goodnesse, and offereth himself to men to be taken a proof of: so also gracious souls do wish and invite others to share with them in whatsoever grace the Lord doth bestow on them, as <hi>David</hi> doth here, saying to all, <hi>O taste and see.</hi> 8. Albeit this sweetnesse be not found at the first out-putting of faith, yet let faith rest on God, and it shall feel in due time, <hi>for blessed is he that putteth his trust in God</hi>; yea, faith it self is a taste of that grace that is in God.</p>

               <p>Another Doctrine concerning Gods care to feed and provide for all necessary furniture, unto the believer, with the use thereof; which is to fear God. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. True believers in God must study holinesse, for evidencing of their faith; for therefore are they called <hi>Saints,</hi> and his <hi>Saints.</hi> 2. The fear of the Lord is the property of the Saints, whereby they are set on work to do what the Lord commandeth, and to forbear what he forbiddeth; and no bonds of inclination, counsel, example, lawes, fear of shame, or punishment from men, are able to keep a man in order when he meeteth with a fit tentation to sin, but the fear of God restraineth the man both outwardly and inwardly, in secret, and open, alwayes, and every where<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and whatsoever measure of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:41635:105"/>
fear the Saints have attained unto, yet may they be exhorted, and must hearken unto exhortation, to grow in this grace: <hi>O fear the Lord, ye his Saints.</hi> 3. Such as fear God, need not to want any necessary furniture in Gods service, <hi>for there is no want to them that fear him.</hi> 4. Proud oppressors, wealthy and potent Princes, that trust in their own power, shall not be so sure of their own standing and furniture, as the meanest of true believers are. <hi>The lions do lack and suffer hunger, but they that seek the Lord shall not want.</hi> Though the godly may want many earthly things yet shall they have food and raiment, <hi>and shall not want any good thing.</hi> 6. The right sort of fearing of God, and labouring for more and more near communion with him, are inseparable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of the Saints, for they that are called Saints are called here <hi>fearers</hi> of him, and <hi>seekers</hi> of him also.</p>

               <p>In the third place, he giveth direction how a man shall live blessedly, by evidencing the sincerity of the fear of God in him, which is a grace inseparable from faith in God, manifesting it self in obedience to his commands. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. There should be such mutual love and respect between the teacher and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple taught, as is between parents and children; yea, God in his servants offereh himself as a father ready to instruct his visible Church, as his children, <hi>Come, ye children,</hi> saith he, <hi>and hearken unto me.</hi> 2. The true fear of God is the way to live blessedly in this life; where misery most aboundeth, and this should be a motive to seek after this grace, for it is asked here, <hi>What man is he that desireth life, &amp;c?</hi> and then the way to attain to it, is set down in some particulars of the fear of God, as the inseparable compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of faith in God. 3. The true fear of God must evidence it self by the fruits thereof, such as are the ruling of mans tongue, &amp; of the rest of the outward man; eschewing whatsoever the Lord forbids, and endeavouring every good duty which God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth, and the keeping peace with all men so farre as in us li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:41635:106"/>
for so doth the Prophets words bear, <hi>vers.</hi> 13, 14. This is the evidence of the fear of God in effect, when such outward works proceed from inward principles of saving grace.</p>

As the righteous lend their ears to Gods word, to his promises and precepts: so the Lord lendeth his eare to their supplications and desires, <hi>His ears are open to their cry.</hi> 4. On the other hand, as the wicked, who fear not God, set their face to do evill, and to transgresse Gods commands; so God shall set his face against them, to be avenged upon them: <hi>The face of the Lord is against them that do evil.</hi> 5. The only happinesse which the wicked man seeketh, is to have riches, honour and pleasure in the earth, and to have his own name in estimation among men hereafter, and these things also, beside the losse of heaven shall be taken from him, and his temporal life withal; for <hi>The face of the Lord is against them, to cut off their remembrance from the earth.</hi>

The Lord putteth the godly to trouble, and by trouble putteth them to their prayers, and delayes answer til the need be great; and then they do cry to the Lord, and then he giveth evidence of his hearing, and sendeth deliverance; for <hi>The righteous cry, and the Lord heareth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles.</hi> 2. It is as true, as it may seem strange, that the Lord wil press his own so long with trouble til he break their hearts, and kil their natural courage and confidence; for here are the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly described to be men of <hi>a broken heart, and contrite spirit.</hi> 3. Though the Lord so break the natural confidence of his own, and so empty them (by trouble) of all conceit of their own worth, wisdom or ability to deliver themselves out of trouble, that they may rely on God only; yet wil he not withdraw himself from them, nor suffer them to perish in discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement. <hi>The Lord is neer to them that are of a broken heart, and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit.</hi> 4. Though the righteous be the only men in the world whom God loveth best; yet will he not only not exempt them from trouble, but also wil exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise them with multitudes and varieties of troubles from his own hand immediately, from Satans temptations, from the malice of the wicked of the world, &amp;c. <hi>Many are the troubles of the righteous</hi>; for thus wil the Lord conform the redeemed to their head, try, and traine them up in faith, and patient sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to Gods wil; teach them to pray and wait on, and give proof of the sincerity of the grace given to them. 5. The god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are as oft delivered, as they are troubled; either by removing of the trouble, or by giving strength and patience to bear it, or comfort under it, and certain hope of outgate from it; or by ending all troubles to them at once. <hi>His troubles are many; but the Lord delivereth him out of them all.</hi> 6. The Lord modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, weigheth, and measureth all the troubles of his own, what they shal suffer in their life and death, and leaveth it not to the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:41635:108"/>
wil of the instruments of their trouble. <hi>He keepeth all his bones, not one of them is broken.</hi> This was true of Christ our Lord, of whom many things were prefigured, and prophesied in the Psalms; and in this amongst the rest, which sheweth: That in the Psalms, as the matter wil suffer, Christ is much to be eyed, and more then <hi>David,</hi> of whom at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>, the same seemeth to speak chiefly. 7. As to the opposite state of the wicked; <hi>Wee learne,</hi> That the wickednesse of the wicked, is both the merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious cause, and the means also of the wicked mans destruction; <hi>For evil shall slay the wicked.</hi> 8. It is the mark of a wicked man, <hi>to hate the righteous</hi> for his righteousness; and so is it set down here. 9. He that hateth the righteous, or the image of God in his neighbour, shal be guilty of all the consequences of the enmity, and be destitute of comfort when he hath most need, <hi>He that hateth the righteous, shall be desolate.</hi>

               <p>The third opposition between the righteous and the wicked, is in relation to what is said in the former <hi>verse. Whence learne,</hi> 1. The wicked shal perish in their sin, and for their sin; But the righteous shal not perish in their sinnes, nor for them; for, <hi>Evil shal slay the wicked; but the Lord shall redeeme the soules of his servants,</hi> to wit, out of sinne and misery. 2. As the wicked are servants of sin, and serve an ill Master, and get an ill reward; so the godly are servants of righteousness, and have God for their Master, and shal have delivery and salvation for their reward, as the comparison here set down sheweth. 3. As the wicked who are destitute of faith in God, when they fall in trouble, want consolation: So all the righteous, who are no other then sincere Believers in God, shal have good company and consolation in all their trouble, and never be left alone: for, <hi>The haters of the righteous shal be desolate, but none of them that trust in God shall be desolate.</hi>

means. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. It is a good reason to strengthen our hope to be heard, when our comfort and Gods glory may both be promoted, by the granting of our desire, as here we find it. 2. The destruction of the enemies of the Church, is not a matter of rejoycing in mens destruction, but of rejoycing in the Lord, and in his wise manner of delivering of his people; <hi>My soule shal be joyful in the Lord, it shall rejoyce in his salvation.</hi> 3. In the estimation of the godly, the tongue is too little to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the Lord for his mercies; for their desire is, that all the powers of the soul, and that all the parts of the body, even the bones, which are least sensible in their own kind, might praise him; <hi>All my bones shal say, &amp;c.</hi> 4. The Lord hath waies wonderful, others and more then ever man conceived, wherby he can deliver his own in their lowest condition from their oppressors, when they are in the height of their power and pride, <hi>Lord, who is like unto thee? which deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, &amp;c.</hi> 5. Though before deliverance come, Faith hath cause to say all that sense can say of Gods praises, after delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is come; yet when sensible experience of a hoped delivery is come, there is a more hearty and a more chearful manner of expressing of the Lords praises, then can be before it come; as the promise of the Prophet, to say, so and so, as is in the Text, after the delivery is come, doth import. 6. It is a sort of (as it were) ingaging of God to deliver, when the heart of the Believer ingageth it self to glorifie God after the deliverie; for here the Prophet maketh use of this, promising praise towards this end.</p>

The godly are subject, not only to be backbitten, and traduced privily, and slandered more openly; but also to be charged unjustly before Judges, and pursued crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally for their life without a cause, and to have false witnesse led against them, that they may be condemned under colour of Law; this was found in effect by <hi>David,</hi> and Christ represented by him. <hi>False witnesses did rise up; They laid to my charge things that I knew not.</hi> 2. No bonds of nature or humanity will bind up the wicked from persecuting the godly, even to death, how wel soever the godly have deserved of them, <hi>They rewarded me evil for good, to the depriving me of my life.</hi> 3. True love is best known, as by rejoycing at anothers welfare, so by grieving for his grief; <hi>When they were sick, my cloathing was sackcloth.</hi> 4. Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty prayer also for any man, is a token of unfeigned love to a man, specially when prayer and fasting are joyned together for them, <hi>I humbled my soul by fasting.</hi> 5. When the expressions of grief, by words or teares in prayer for any, waken up the affection yet more to pray ardently for them; It is yet a farther token of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned love of them for whom we pray. <hi>My prayer</hi> (saith he) <hi>returned into my bosome</hi>; which is as much, as my expressions in prayer, in sighes, affectionate words and teares, affected my heart (<hi>Lament.</hi> 3.49.51.) with new motions of earnest dealing for them. 6. True Christians affection to their enemies, is able to affect the soul, as much to the seeking their welfare, and commiserating their miserie, as the natural affection of a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral man can affect him toward friends and kinsfolk, in nearest natural relations unto him; for <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>I behaved my self as though he had been my friend or brother; I bowed down heavily as one that mourneth for his mother.</hi>

As it is lawful to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Lords seeming long delay to help us, so we must not complain too soon; for before <hi>David</hi> uttereth this, <hi>how long,</hi> he is long in trouble, and in danger of his life, by unreasonable and beastly <hi>cruel</hi> men, and is altogether destitute of all means of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, as his prayer testifieth; <hi>Rescue my soul from their destructions, my darling from the Lions.</hi> 3. The godly by faith in the deepest danger, may see their delivery in their sadest and darkest sorrow; yea may behold the light of consolation coming; in their banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, may behold their liberty, and see their fellowship with the Saints; and in the midst of complaints, may promise to themselves reasons of praise, and the payment of their vows made to God, as here we see in the midst of this sad condition the Prophet saith, <hi>I will give thee thanks in the great congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: I will praise thee among much people.</hi> 4. It augmenteth the grief of the godly, to see the wicked take advantage of their trouble, and mockers of Religion to rejoyce over their sufferings in a good cause; and they may heartily deprecate this evil, that it may not at least, last long; <hi>Let not those that are my enemies rejoyce over me.</hi> 5. The less cause of provocation of our enemies be given to them by us, the greater is the hope of delivery, and the readier shall be our help from God, and the less cause shal be to the enemy to wink with the eye, as witty well pleased scoffers do, when they get their will; <hi>Neither let them wink with the eye,</hi> saith he, <hi>that hate me without a cause</hi> 6.

in God, and setleth his faith on the praise-worthy properties of God. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1.

Albeit the carriage of the wicked toward God, and the godly, doth tend to obscure Gods glory, in the point of justice toward the one, and point of mercy toward the other; yet the works of creation, and the constant go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment therof, shal bear witness of the constancy of Gods <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>faithfulness,</hi> and <hi>righteousness,</hi> and <hi>judgement,</hi> as here is shewen. 3.

Let Gods works and his word be compared together, and the truth of his promises and threatnings shall be so traced, and seem to be true, as shall satisfie us, and let us see so far till our eye can follow no farther, <hi>Thy faithfulness reacheth unto the clouds.</hi> 5. Whatsoever carnal reason may judge of Gods dispensations towards the godly, and the wicked: yet his holiness and justice is firme and unchangeable, <hi>Thy righteousness is like the great mountains.</hi> 6. Albeit we cannot see thorow matters, nor recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile cross cogitations, sometimes offered from the grounds of faith on the one hand, and from the effects of providence offered by sense on the other hand, yet must we remember that God is wiser then we, and his deep draughts are past finding out by us, <hi>Thy judgements are a great deep.</hi> 7. This one consideration of Gods course of kindness to his own creatures, making his Sun to shine, and his rain to fall on his enemies, as on his friends, may quiet our mind, concerning Gods sparing for a time the wicked, and liberal dealing with them; <hi>O Lord, thou preservest man and beast.</hi> There is a course of common preservation, and kindness, running toward all. 8.

In the use of the means and holy ordinances of God given to his Church, God shall make the man, that indeed giveth him credit upon the word of his grace, sensibly feel the joy of the holy Spirit, to be unspeakable and full of glory, and that there are greater contentments to be found for a mans soul<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> in God reconciled through Christ, then the world can yeeld beside; for, <hi>Thou shalt make them drink of the rivers of thy pleasures</hi>

If it were wel considered, that all the prosperity of the wicked is but in things concerning the outward mans back and belly, and that this prosperity is but temporal, and oft-times of shorter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance then a mans own brittle life, there should be no ground of envy found therin; for, <hi>They shall soon be cut down like grass, and wither like the green herb.</hi>

               <p>From the second point of Gods counsel and direction; <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Holding fast the Covenant of Grace made with God, through Christ, and studying to bring out the fruits of faith, in obedience to Gods command, is a soveraign remedy against male-content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with a mans own condition, and against envying of the wicked, <hi>Trust in the Lord, and do good.</hi> 2.

The up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right believer in God is the only man that gets the right use of the creature, and in whose cup the true juice of Gods benefits being pressed out is poured, whose bread is dipped in oil, and in whom spiritual life is constantly entertained, <hi>Verily thou,</hi> that art such a man, <hi>shalt be fed.</hi>

               <p>From the third direction to ward off the tentation; <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The godly man hath warrant to make God the object of his delight, who being reconciled to the believer through the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, is become the believers own, in whom he may continually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce; but the object of the ungodly prosperous mans delight, is but
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:41635:117"/>
some creature or temporal trifle; for to the believer it is said, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light thy self in the Lord.</hi> 2. Though the believer be rich in his rights, yet he is slow to make use<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> therof, and hath need to be stirred up to take possession, <hi>Delight thy self.</hi> 3. If the believer shal make use of his Covenant-right, and interest in God, and set his affections upon him, he shal find such solid contentment and satisfaction in God, as he shal not envy the condition of the most prosperous wicked man in the world; for it is said, <hi>Delight thy self in the Lord, and hee wil give thee the desire of thy heart.</hi> And certainly the forgetting or not hearkning to this direction, is the cause of our being male-contented with our lot, and of our envying of the wicked.</p>

               </q>
               <p>From the fourth direction; <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. When we bear the burden of our own affairs our selves, and are chastised with anxiety and want of success, and with envying the ungodly who prosper bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then we do; the best remedy is first to do our duty, as we are inabled in the use of the means, then cast the care of the success o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver on God, as the plow-man doth when he hath harrowed his land, and let the burden of it rest on God, and let us not take it off him again, but put our mind to rest, resolved to take the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest in good part, as he shal send it; <hi>Commit thy way unto the Lord, trust also in him.</hi> 2. The man who followeth this direction, shal come to speed best in his affairs; because God shal do that, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the man shal have reason to be satisfied; for that which he would have done, or what is better, shal be effected, <hi>Commit thy cause unto the Lord, and he shal bring it to pass.</hi> 3. It is possible that the godly following this counsel, may be misreported of, and both lose his labour and estimation among men, yet it shal not be long so; for, <hi>God shal bring forth thy righteousness as the light.</hi> 4. Albeit the godly and his cause may be obscured by a shorter or longer winter-night of trouble, as shal please God to appoint, yet shal he and his cause and integrity be found absolved by God in due time, <hi>He shal bring forth thy judgment</hi> or decree of absolution as the noon day.</p>

               <p>From the fifth direction; <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The victory over this ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to envy the wicked, is not gotten at first, nor by carnal reason, but by faith in God, and patient waiting on him, <hi>Rest on the Lord, and wait patiently for him.</hi> 2. As the tentation unto fretting is very pressing, when we see the wicked get so much of their wil, so much of their purpose brought to pass: so we have need to be pressed again and again to resist this tentation; Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is it said again, <hi>Fret not thy self because of him who prospereth in his way, or because of the man that bringeth wicked devices to passe.</hi>

The insolency of the Wicked is such, and their provocation of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oft-times so great, that their spirits are much stirred and kindled with indignation, and thoughts of private revenge; yet must not this passion prevail with the godly, but should be striven against: <hi>Cease from anger, and forsake wrath</hi>: vengeance is the Lords, he wil repay. 2. The godly should eschew the motions of fretting, anger or envy against the wicked; and if anger enter, he must cease from it; if it urge it self on him with pretences of reason or violent impulsion, he must <hi>forsake it</hi>; but by any means he must keep this tentation within doors, that it drive him not to break forth to a compleated sin in action and doing of wrong, <hi>Fret no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Verse 9</hi> For evil doers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the LORD, they shal inherit the earth.</q>
               <p>The Prophet presseth this direction by sundry reasons; and in
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:41635:118"/>
special, by six comparisons of the Lords way and purpose about the wicked and the godly, how prosperous soever the wicked may be for a time, and howsoever the godly may be afflicted and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised for a time. The first comparison is in this verse. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. If any who pretend to be godly, shal by the foresaid ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation forsake the way of godliness, and follow the way of the wicked, they shal have the reward of the wicked for the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of their way, <hi>For evil doers shall be cut off.</hi> 2. It is not the present condition whereinto men are, which is to be looked unto, but what shal become of them at length; for all the prosperity of the wicked is blasted with this one sentence of the supream Judg, <hi>Evil doors shal be cut off.</hi> 3. Albeit the godly be kept in some hardships for a time, as young heirs in their minority; yet shal their inheritance in heaven (represented by the land of <hi>Canaan</hi>) be reserved unto them; and in the mean time by their heirship in Christ, they have solid right to what portion in this world God doth allow them, they have the use thereof with a good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and remain on the earth as long as God hath service for them, however the wicked would thrust them out of the world as unworthy of it: and if they be banished out of one country, they know, the <hi>earth is the Lords, and the fulness of it,</hi> and they live more contentedly in that condition, then the wicked do live in their nest; for, <hi>They that wait on the Lord shal inherit the earth.</hi>

               <p>From the second comparison of the wicked and the godly; <hi>learn,</hi> 1. We must not pass sentence suddenly, to absolve their way who are prosperous, or to condemne their way who are crossed; but we should wait upon Gods word, til God from heaven manifest his judgment about both, which shal not long be delayed in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the wicked; for, <hi>Yet a little while, and the wicked shal not be, yea thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shal not be.</hi> 2. Submission unto Gods dispensation allayeth all troubles, and enlargeth the good of every benefit; and a good construction of Gods dealing with us, bringeth much peace and quietness of mind with it, and enricheth our portion, <hi>The meek shal inherit the earth, and shal delight themselves in the abundance of peace.</hi>

               </q>
               <p>The third comparison of the wicked and godly looseth a doubt, when the godly cannot get living in their mean condition, in presence of the wicked, but their life is also in peril by their plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, for effectuating the destruction of the godly. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The godly have to do, not only to wrestle against the thriving condition of the wicked, but also with their deadly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred: <hi>The wicked plot against the righteous, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth.</hi> 2 The godly must make the Lord to be party against the wicked, and must oppose his justice, power and wisdome to the enmity of the wicked; for albeit the godly be forced to mourn at their threa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If the godly did consider of the wicked, as the word of the Lord speaketh of them; they might look upon their boasts, as on the brags of a man up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the scaffold, ready to be executed: For, <hi>God seeth his day is coming.</hi> 4. The godly must resolve to bear the open violence also of the wicked, and to be made as butts for their arrowes, and sheaths for their swords, which is more then their words: For, <hi>The wicked have drawne out their sword, and bent their bowe.</hi> 5. Before deliverance come unto the godly, they shal find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in a weak condition, for any thing they can do for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; for here they are poor and needy; and the wicked thinks <hi>to cast them down.</hi> 6. Those are the truly godly, and the objects of the wickeds malice, who for their inward condition depend on God in the sense of their poverty and neediness, and withall are of <hi>an upright conversation,</hi> as they are here described. 7. When the wicked are most near to do a mischief to the Lords people, then is a mischief most near unto them; <hi>Their sword shal enter into their own heart, and their bow shal be broken.</hi>

               </q>
               <p>From the fifth comparison of the godly and wicked; <hi>Learne</hi> 1. The godly have two advantages above the wicked, one in this life, another in the life to come. For the first, all the vicissitudes of dangers and daily necessities of the godly are taken notice of in a special way by God, choosing and weighing to them exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses for their condition, moderating them in their measure and time, seasoning them with mixture of consolation, turning them to their best; furnishing all necessaries to bear out their exercises, and sending particular deliverances one after another: <hi>For the Lord knowes the dayes of the upright.</hi> As for the next life, he hath reserved for them an inheritance of constant blessedness, never to be taken from them: <hi>Their inheritance shal be for ever.</hi> 2. Albeit the Lord wil not exempt the godly from sharing in
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:41635:119"/>
common calamities with the wicked, yet shall they have the evidences of Gods favour to them in the time of trouble, and shall not be disappointed of the kindnesse promised by God, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected by them: <hi>They shall not be ashamed in the evill time.</hi> 3. Whatsoever scant or inlack be of creature-comfort, the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shall be supplied to their reasonable satisfaction: <hi>In the dayes of famine they shall be satisfied.</hi> 4. When the wicked are most liberally dealt with, it is but a feeding of them like beasts to the slaughter, all their glory shall vanish, and they themselves shall be destroyed in Gods wrath: <hi>But the wicked shall perish, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of the Lord shall be as the fat of Lambs, they shall consume into smoake, they shall consume away.</hi>

               </q>
               <p>From the sixth comparison, <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. In the middest of the wicked mans wealth, he is oft times wanting, as if he were a poor man; if he have much wealth, he hath much to do with it, and many times is unable to defray his charges without borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and when he has borrowed, he is either unable or unwilling to pay again, and so is but a miserable wretch with all he hath; or he is a profuse prodigall and deceiver of his creditors: <hi>The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again.</hi> 2. On the contrary, the righteous man by his godly behaviour, mannageth the little which God giveth him so well, as he needeth not to borrow; he wanteth not for any good work which God calleth him unto, and is able to supply others necessities: <hi>The righteous sheweth mercy, and giveth.</hi> 3. The blessing of God on the godly, maketh the oddes betwixt them and the wicked, for it is to him as good as the inheritance of the whole earth; but Gods curse rooteth the wicked man out of the earth; for <hi>Such</hi> (saith he) <hi>as be blessed of him, shall inherit the earth; and they that be cursed, shall be cut off.</hi>

               <p>He closeth the confirmation of the sixth direction with enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating sundry priviledges of the godly, of some whereof, he made observation in his own time. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of the godly are so great, as should content him, albeit his outward prosperity and wealth be not such as he conceiveth the wicked to have; for God teacheth the godly how to behave himself in his particular actions, prudently and holily: <hi>The steps of a good man are ordered of the Lord,</hi> he approveth the course the godly man keepeth; <hi>He delights in his way.</hi> Though the godly man through infirmity fall into a sinne, or by his sin draw on a calamity on himself, yet the Lord recovereth him again; <hi>Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down</hi>; and that he perish not when he falleth, the Lord shall preserve him by holding a grip of him; <hi>The Lord upholdeth him with his hand.</hi> 2. Albeit the Lord will not exempt the godly from poverty, nor yet their seed; albeit we presuppose the children be godly also, if he think it good to exercise them so; yet the Lord hath made the examples of such misery so rare, as a man of good years could observe few or none of them beggers; specially in the Prophets time, when God by external benefits, was training his people to the hope of spirituall things, as <hi>David</hi> here testifieth. 3. It is a gift of God to use whatsoever a man receiveth of God, so as others be helped there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; <hi>The godly is ever mercifull and lendeth.</hi> 4.

Temporall blessings or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits are not so promised to the godly, as that they shall be free from troubles, crosses and persecutions. For the Lord for his own glory, for edification of his Church, and for conviction of his enemies, and for perfecting his children in holinesse, useth to suffer the wicked to hunt and persecute them, even to death; <hi>The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.</hi> 2. The wicked may apprehend the righteous mans person, lay false ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations to his charge, and bring him before Judges, and not get his will of him, to drive him from a righteous cause: For, <hi>The Lord will not leave him in his hand.</hi> 3.

               <p>The eighth direction, is to wait on God, and to keep his way; serving with the former direction, to guard the godly mans
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:41635:121"/>
heart against all tentations of fretting, envy, anger and emulation, because of the wicked mans seeming more prosperous condition in the world then his own, and this direction is confirmed with five reasons. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. He that believeth on God must not make haste, nor judge rashly of matters as they seem for the present, but must attend till God make his word good; <hi>Wait on the Lord.</hi> 2. True patient hope and waiting on God, must be joyned with the study of obedience to Gods directions; <hi>Wait on the Lord, and keep his way.</hi> 3. Though the godly be kept under for a while and humbled, yet God shall lift them up to a satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory estate: <hi>He shall exalt thee to inherit the land.</hi> This promise is the first reason to move us to wait on the Lord. 4. In every age some of the wicked shall be made spectacles of Gods threatened judgement, before the eyes of the godly, to give assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his judgement; that he shall overthrow all the rest in due time, and avenge on them all the wrongs done by them unto the godly: <hi>When the wicked are cut-off, thou shalt see it.</hi> And this is the second argument to confirme the exhortation. 5. How the wicked have seemed very glorious in the world for a while, and shortly both they and their glory did vanish, every man in his own time should make their own remarkes and obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, as the Prophet sheweth here, that he had his observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in his time, <hi>vers.</hi> 35, 36. And this is the third reason to confirme the direction taken from experience concerning the wicked.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver. 37.</hi> Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright; for the end of <hi>that</hi> man is peace.</p>

               </q>
               <p>The fourth reason of the direction, is from the happy close of the course of the godly, and the certain perdition of the wicked; <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The Lord gives so many remarkable instances of the comfortable departure of the godly out of this life, as may give assurance of the dying of all the upright in Gods favour: <hi>Mark the upright man, for the end of that man is peace.</hi> 2. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men be witnesses or not of the departure of the wicked, one and all of them die in a desperate condition; they are deprived of heaven and earth, and perish soul and body at the expiring of their breath: <hi>Transgressours shall be destroyed together; the end of the wicked shall be cut off.</hi>

                     <hi>Ver. 39.</hi> But the salvation of the righteous <hi>is</hi> of the LORD; he <hi>is</hi> their strength in the time of trouble.</p>

                     <hi>40.</hi> And the LORD shall help them and deliver them; he shall deliver them from the wicked, and save them because they trust in him.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The last reason to move men to wait on God, is from his care of the godlie. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. How hard soever the condition of the godly be, the Lord hath ways of his own to preserve and save them; yea the Lord is resolved, and hath passed his word that he will save them: <hi>The salvation of the righteous is of the Lord.</hi> 2. So long as God is pleased to let righteous mens trouble continue, he will now and then comfort them, and will enable them to their trouble, when comfort is suspended: <hi>He is their strength in time of trouble.</hi> 3. When the godly in their trouble feel their own wants and weaknesse, he will furnish what in them is lacking, till the delivery come; <hi>The Lord shall help them, and deliver them.</hi> 4. Albeit many be the troubles of the godly, especially from their wicked persecuters; yet by faith in God they shall keep their conscience clean: Their cause they maintain whole, and shall have their souls safe, do what their persecuters can; <hi>He shall deliver them from the wicked, and save them because they trust in him.</hi>

When it pleaseth the Lord to make his children sensible of their sinnes, and of his dreadfull justice; he can make the tokens of his displeasure against sinne piercing sharp, and pressing heavy: <hi>Thy arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore.</hi> 2. Although the Lord should set us as a marke to shoot at, and lay the heaviest load of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on us for our sinnes; yet we must not seek the ease thereof, nor can we have ease from them, save by coming to God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, to bemoan our misery, as this example teacheth us. 3. As the sense of trouble on our body, or any way else will waken the conscience of sinne; so the conscience of sinne, and feeling of wrath due for our sin, will make no small alteration on our very bodies: <hi>There is no soundnesse in my flesh, because of thine anger, nor rest in my bones because of my sinne.</hi> One sinne will waken the memory of moe sinnes, till they present themselves as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable army; <hi>My iniquities are gone over my head.</hi> 5. How light soever sin may seem when it is committed, it will be found insupportably heavy, when God pursues for it: <hi>As an heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, they are too heavy for me.</hi> 6. When the Lord doth smite the conscience for sin, the rod will not fail to make a wound, which shall have need of the cure of the Physician, according to the bruise made by his hand, or deep peircing of his arrowes; for after <hi>arrowes</hi> and pressing <hi>hand,</hi> he mentions <hi>wounds</hi> more then one. 7. When a wounded spirit is not timeously by a right cure bound up and healed, the wounds do grow the longer the worse; the longer, the more guiltinesse, filthinesse and perplexity of spirit doth grow: <hi>My wounds do stink and are corrupt.</hi> 8. As through our inconsideration of our duty, and danger of sinning
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:41635:124"/>
we fal actually in sin, and do draw upon our selves wrath: So by our inconsideration of the right remedie, we augment that measure of both: <hi>My wounds stink and are corrupt, because of my foolishnesse.</hi> 9. So long as the conscience of sin and sense of wrath kept on therby do last, the mans wit and his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and his countenance and his joy are smitten, both before God and men: <hi>I am troubled, I am bowed down greatly, I go mourning all the day long.</hi> 10. To add to the pace, and to make the sense of sin more bitter, the Lord can lay his hand on the body, and make the loathsomness of the sickness resemble the loathsomness of the sin which drew it on, and to speak unto the conscience in its own language, the cause why it is sent unto him: <hi>For my loines are filled with a loathsome disease; and there is no soundness in my flesh.</hi> 11. A wounded spirit wil dash and beat down the stoutest heart it can meet with, <hi>I am feeble and sore broken.</hi> 12. If the Lord pursue a mans conscience for sin, and intimate his displeasure against him, and continue this exercise for any time; it wil pass the mans power to hide or smother his grief, or hold in the expressions thereof: <hi>I have roared b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Sore trials cannot be born without holding fast the gripe of the Covenant of Grace; for this fixeth faith, and strengthens hope, and furnisheth patience in greatest troubles; for <hi>David</hi> rendereth this reason, for his bearing patiently his foresaid hard condition: <hi>In thee, O Lord, do I hope; Thou wilt hear, O Lord, my God.</hi> 3. If the Covenant be holden fast, wherby we may warrantably cal God our God; we may be as it were, surety to our self for a good answer from God; <hi>Thou wilt hear me, O Lord my God.</hi> 4. When the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the godly in their righteous cause, are ready to triumph over the godly and their cause, and the godly are like to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, if the Lord help not; then the godly may be sure the Lord wil hear and help: For <hi>David</hi> giveth this for a reason of his perswasion, that God would hear him, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. because the enemies otherwayes would triumph, and he be made <hi>to halt,</hi> and turn off the way, <hi>vers.</hi> 16, 17. for in this the Lords glory is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terested. 5. When the outward prosperous condition of the godly is changed, and their feet slip, and the hand of the Lord lieth on sore without relaxation, even they of strong faith are ready to be discouraged and faint; so weak are we in faith when a hard trial cometh: For, <hi>When the enemy magnified him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self against</hi> David; <hi>When his feet slipped, when his sorrow was continually before him</hi>; He confesseth he was ready to halt; To warn the godly, that they might guard against this tentation. 6 To keep our selves from fretting under trouble, it is expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that we compare our sins with Gods fatherly chastisements of us, and that we take course for remission of our sin, and turn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Lord so disposeth of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward condition of the godly and the wicked in this life, that the godly oft-times have the mourning part, and the wicked the rejoycing part, and that so much the more as they see the head of the godly is born down: <hi>I wil be sorry for my sin, but mine enemies are lively and strong.</hi> 8. As it is a matter of grief to see the affliction of the godly growing, and the enemies growing in joy, and strength, and number; so it is a matter of comfort, that the enemies of the godly are enemies without a just cause given to them: <hi>They that hate me wrongfully, are multiplied.</hi> 9. We must not leave off the doing of what God requireth at our hands, albeit we should have the hatred of the world; for <hi>David followed

that which was good,</hi> albeit his adversaries for that very cause <hi>did render to him evil for good.</hi>

We must not limit the Lord to give us comfort and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, when we think we have greatest need of it, but must leave our prayer at his feet, as the Prophet doth. 2. The believer must be so warie to lean unto sense, that he must hold the gripes of faith not only when he misseth sense of comfort, but also when Gods dispensation toward him, and his sense therof doth seem to speak most contrary to faith: <hi>Forsake me not, O Lord; be not far from me: Make haste to help me,</hi> saith <hi>Davids</hi> Faith, when his sense speaketh what his prayer here importeth, that is, present perdition. 3. The bond of the Covenant of Grace is able to bear the weight of the believers most heavy burden, and by vertue of it, he may lay claim unto God, as his own God, and lay claim also unto salvation in him; for notwithstanding of all the troubles and tentations laid forth in this Psalm, the Believer sustaineth all on this ground; <hi>O my God, O Lord my salvation</hi>; And here is the victory of Faith.</p>

               <p>THe Prophet for fear of impatient expression in his trouble, resolved to keep silence in the audience of the wicked, but was not able to keep in his passionate wishing for death. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. As it is the Lords wil that we should have the infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Saints registred unto us for our edification, as wel as their vertues: So it is his wil, that when the confession of our infirmity may profit others, we should not spare to let it be known, as this passage teacheth us. 2. Conscience of our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and of the unruliness of our tongues, ready to break forth in the time of tentation, should make us take better heed to our selves, and to watch over our speeches: <hi>I said, I wil take heed to my wayes, that I sinne not with my tongue.</hi> 3. Because the wicked may take advantage of the godlies miscarrying in time of their trouble, it is needful to watch the more over our beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and words in their presence: <hi>I wil keep my mouth with a bridle, while they are before me.</hi> 4. When we are about to keep in our corruptions, and amend our own faults by our own way of it, by our wisdom, our strength, our resolutions, we do not eschew the evil we would eschew, and we also fal in a fault we were not aware of, as here in stead of praying to God to direct one part of his speech after another, that he might speak prudently in the audience of the wicked, he did not speak at all, he did not speak that which he might, and should have spoken: <hi>I was dumb with silence, I held my peace even from good.</hi> 5. When grief is not rightly vented but suppressed, it is not therby asswaged but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased rather: <hi>I held my peace, and my sorrow was stirred.</hi> 6. The power of sinful nature, and inraged passions is such,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:41635:127"/>
that even when they are opposed by reason of strength of grace in us, they may easily over-power us, except God put to his hand to help us in the conflict; <hi>My heart was hot within me: while I was musing the fire burned: then spake I with my tongue.</hi> 7. It is a natural evil in man when he is overcome by trouble in this life, to wish for death, looking to be in a better condition by the change; As the sick man looketh for ease by changing of his bed, and here <hi>ver.</hi> 4. we have the example of it. 8. The shortness of this life is a mitigation of the troubles thereof un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the godly, and the fear that life should continue longer then the afflicted man would, augmenteth the trouble; and this is the fountain of this passionate and curious wish: <hi>Lord make me to know mine end, and the measure of my dayes what it is: that I may know how frail I am.</hi>

For tempering our condition what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever it be, it should suffice us to know, that whether we be in prosperity or adversity, our time in this life is but short: <hi>Thou hast made my days as an hand-breadth, and mine age is as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing before thee.</hi> 2. Not in prosperity, but in adversity, is the uncertainty, weakness, emptiness, and vanity of prosperity, and things temporal wel seen; for in troubles sayes <hi>David, Verily every man at his best state is altogether vanity.</hi> 3. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever seemeth excellent in the eyes of natural men in this world is but the shadow of what it seemeth; health, strength, prosperity, riches, pleasure, honour, dominion, power, authority are but

Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience putteth a deep stamp of the truth upon a mans mind, and causes him to set his subscription unto it without hesitation, <hi>Verily, surely, surely,</hi> is the seal of this truth here delivered after his experience. 6. The too much care which men take to gather riches, this toyling and travelling, this spending of body, of wit and time, this frowning on some, and fawning on others, this pleading and fighting with some, and flattering of others, with the rest of other shifts by which men use to gather riches, (which they must leave behind them, and do not know to whom) is a point of great folly and vanity in men; <hi>He heapes up riches, and knoweth not who shal gather them.</hi> 7. The right use of the perceived vanity of all things under the Sun, is, that we should be sent by that consideration unto God to rest on him; <hi>And now, Lord, what wait I for?</hi> 8. That which God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised in the life to come, is only satisfactory and able to quiet a mans mind, and make him patiently wait on God in all his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; <hi>What wait I for? my hope is in thee.</hi>

<pb n="245" facs="tcp:41635:128"/>
                  <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Seeing sin doth plunge us in all perplexities, and bringeth trouble after trouble upon us; the best cure of our trouble, is to seek pardon for our sins; <hi>Deliver me from all my transgressions.</hi> 2. The ungodly are fools, let them seem to themselves and others what they please; for all their way and work is to make themselves miserable; therefore doth the Scripture call them <hi>foolish.</hi> 3. That the wicked get no advantage of us so as by troubling of us to drive us from the profession of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, for which they do persecute us, should be the main care of every Believer under persecution: For this is <hi>Davids</hi> prayer, <hi>Make me not the reproach of the foolish.</hi> 4. It is usuall to us to see our duty after we have sinned, better then before; for, after experience of his falling, he resolveth it is his duty not to speak an impatient word, but <hi>to be silent, and not open his mouth,</hi> to wit, impatiently. 5. The consideration of God for our party, with whom we have to do in trouble, should humble us, and make us quiet; <hi>David</hi> saith, he should not have opened his mouth, <hi>Because thou Lord didst it.</hi> 6. Prayer for removing the tokens of Gods displeasure, especially after pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for remission of sins, is not contrary to patience and silen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> submission under Gods hand; for he prayeth also, <hi>Remove away thy stroak from me.</hi> 7. When we feel the Lords hand heavy upon us, we may bemoan our selves to him with submission to his will, for he pitieth us, and will lay no more on us then we are able to bear, <hi>I am consumed by the blow of thy hand.</hi> 8. The stoutest and strongest courage will soon be brought down by trouble of conscience; when God entreth in judgement with him, man falls down: <hi>When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou makest his beauty to consume away like a mothe: surely, every man is vanity.</hi> 9. When God seemeth to refuse to hear prayer, true faith will follow God with more fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent prayer, and crying, and tears, and not leave God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a good answer: <hi>Hear my prayer, O Lord; give ear unto my cry, hold not thy peace at my tears.</hi> 10. The more our hearts be alienated from this world, and conversant with God by faith; the more we misse our countrey, our parents, our kinsmen on earth, and have our conversation in heaven, the more we may be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured that God shall avow himself to be our God: <hi>I am a stranger and a sojourner with thee.</hi> 11. Entring our selves heirs unto the godly, who lived before us in their estrangements from the world, and seeking after heaven, intitleth us unto their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts also; <hi>I am a sojourner, as all my fathers.</hi> 12.

The godly may pray for a little breathing before death with submission, that they may the more quietly render up their spitits to God: <hi>Spare me, that I may recover strength before I go hence and be no more.</hi> 14.

Albeit waiting for the time is joyned with languour and grief, yet the remembrance of it is sweet, and it wants not a blessing following it, <hi>I waited, and he enclined to me, and heard my cry.</hi> 3.

As it is a part of our duty to glorifie God after every mercy, and in a speciall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner when the mercy is very notable: So it is a new gift of God to enable a man to give thanks, and praise for the mercy received; therefore it is put for a point of thanksgiving, <hi>He hath put a new song in my mouth.</hi> 6.

them all, therefore doth he call the praises which he did sing, <hi>The praises of our God.</hi> 7. The right observation of Gods mercy to his children, especially when he will shew himself eminently, is able to strike a man with much awe and reverence of God, who is fearful, even in his praises; <hi>Many shall hear and fear.</hi> 8. Then do we make right observation of Gods mercy to his children, when thereby we encourage our selves to look for the like mercy, when we call for it in our need; <hi>Many shall hear and fear, and trust in the Lord.</hi> 9.

               <p>He condescends upon a particular which did overcome his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration and searching, to wit, the <hi>Covenant</hi> of Redemption be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Father and the Son coming into the world, some articles whereof he toucheth, as they are rehearsed by the Son speaking here by his Spirit. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The work of Redemption by Christ, the Covenant betwixt the Father and the Son about our Redemption, the incarnation of the Son of God, and the course of the salvation of the redeemed, is one of the most wonderful things that ever was heard tell of, wherein so many wonderful works of God, so many wonderful thoughts of God about us do concur, that they can neither be declared nor numbered, nor set in order: for this work here touched is set down for an instance of what was said in the former verse; now that this is spoken by Christ, the Apostle, <hi>Heb</hi> 10.5, 6. &amp;c. doth shew unto us. 2. Albeit sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices &amp; oblations were appointed to be offered before Christ came yet were they not acceptable in themselves, but in respect of the sacrifice of Christ signified by them; not they, but Christ signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by them could take away sin, <hi>Sacrifices &amp; offerings thou didst not desire, burnt-offerings and sin-offerings thou didst not require,</hi> to wit, for any worth in themselves, or by way of real satisfaction for sin. 3. The ceremonial law was not to remain, but to be taken away when Christ came to offer himself, who was foresha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed by the sacrifices and Levitical ordinances; for, <hi>Sacrifices and oblations thou didst not desire, but mine ears thou hast opened</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> which presupposeth <hi>thou hast formed a body unto me,</hi> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.5. doth shew; and so the rejecting of the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, is at the incarnation, or at the forming of the body of Christ, and bringing the Son into the world. 4. The Son of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate becomes voluntarily, a very capable, discreete, ready and obedient servant to the Father for us: <hi>Mine ears hast thou opened,</hi> to wit, for receiving of every command; <hi>or mine ears hast thou boared,</hi> as the servants ears were boared under the Law, when he choosed to

stay still with his master in service, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.5. 5. By offering of burnt-offering God was not satisfied for sin, but only by Christs coming and offering himself a sacrifice once for all, <hi>Burnt-offering and sin-offering hast thou not required; Then said I, Lo, I come,</hi> saith Christ. 6. Both in the book of Gods eternal decrees, and in the book of holy Scripture, this way of taking away the sins of men was established, as the only way to effect it; for that the seed of the woman by his suffering should bruse the head of the Serpent was foretold by God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. and Christ was the Lamb slain in the representative sacrifices from the beginning of the world; <hi>In the volume of thy book it is written of me.</hi> 7. Jesus Christ God incarnate is in Covenant with God the Father, that believers may be in Covenant with God by this means also, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth he call him, <hi>O my God</hi>: as our Lord, <hi>Iob.</hi> 20.17. saith I ascend to my Father and your Father, to my God and you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.10. doth expound, it to perform whatever might sanctifie us through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out for ever. 4.

                  <hi>I delight to do thy will, O my God.</hi> 10.

               <p>In the third place, as Christ hath given an accompt of the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of his Priestly Office, in expiation of sin; so here he giveth accompt of his Prophetical office, to make way for his intercession. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Christ did not only undertake to suffer for expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of our sins, but also he undertook to apply to his people, by preaching, the fruits of his sufferings, for their righteousness and salvation, for justifying, sanctifying, and saving the redeemed; <hi>I have preached righteousness in the great congregation.</hi> 2. The way appointed for application of the grace purchased to the redeemed, is preaching; <hi>I have preached righteousness in the great Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> in the visible Church, and in all confluences of the redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed where opportunity is offered. 3. As Christ did not conceal what might save souls, but did communicate it carefully; so should they who are trusted by him to preach without fear sincerely, as they wil be able to answer God, proclaim it, <hi>I have not refrained my lips, O Lord, thou knowest.</hi> 4. The true way of justification of sinners by faith, is a Jewel so precious and necessary for poor souls, that it should not be concealed, <hi>I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart.</hi> 5. One Sermon on this subject is not sufficient, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to make this mystery plain, how by faith in Christ the man that flieth to him is justified from his sins, and saved accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Covenant past between the suffering Mediatour and God the faithful promiser to justifie and save by his own way, <hi>I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation.</hi> 6. The way of righteousness and salvation purchased unto believers by Jesus Christ, is very solid and compleat; for first, this way of forgiving sins unto us, because of the satisfaction made by Christ for us in his obedience unto the Father, even unto the death of the Cross, is of Gods own devising, and his free-gift; therefore as it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the righteousnes of God, Rom.</hi> 3.21, 22. So here it is called Gods righteousness. <hi>O Lord, I have not hid thy righteousnes.</hi> And the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation or eternal life annexed unto this imputed and gifted righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness bestowed upon the embracer of it, is also of Gods devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, &amp; his free-gift; therefore it is also called <hi>his salvation, I have declared thy salvation.</hi> Next the certainty and ground of the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers assurance that this righteousness and salvation is made fast unto him, is the truth of God, and faithfulness of God, obliging
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:41635:132"/>
himself to make good this way of justfication and salvation by the Covenant of redemption made between the Father and the Son our Mediatour, as in the promises of the Covenant of grace is set down in Scripture, which can no more disappoint the believer, then the truth and faithfulness of God can fail, <hi>I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation.</hi> And last of all, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, spring and rise, and unchangeable ground of righteousness and salvation purchased by the redemption made by Jesus Christ, and applied to us by faith in him, is the meer good will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of God, the free grace, the free love and bounty of God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any deserving of the redeemed; <hi>I have not concealed thy loving kindness, and thy truth from the great Congregation</hi>; This indeed is a solid ground. 7. The plain preaching, declaration, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation of this Gospel with the grounds thereof, is able by the blessing of God to perswade a trembling soul to lay it self over upon Jesus Christ, and to rest upon the unchangeable truth and kindness of God offered to every poor humble sinner, without exception; for the <hi>preaching</hi> of these things, not <hi>refraining</hi> of the lips, not <hi>hiding</hi> of this precious and saving truth, <hi>the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and not <hi>concealing</hi> of it, is given up here for the sufficiency of means, to apply the purchased righteousness and salvation by Christ to the redeemed; and this execution of Christs Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Office hath been faithfully performed by him, not only in his personal preaching in the days of his flesh, but also in his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters both before his incarnation and since, which also shall be continued from generation, to generation, to the end of the world, maugre all opposition; for Christ shall be able to make no less perfect account of his other Offices then of the Kingly Office, when he shall give up the Kingdome to his Father. 8. What may concern <hi>David</hi> here as the type of Christ, or as one of the servants of Christ, we take it up in one word, which is this: The more faithful Preachers be to declare the Gospel to the salvation of souls, the more confidence and comfort shall the testimony of their conscience afford to them in the day of their trouble, when they come before God; as the Prophet here by experience findeth.</p>

               <p>Christ having given accompt of his performances, of what was undertaken, intercedeth for the promised mercies to his Mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal body and to himself, as standing in the room of the ransomed; wherin <hi>David</hi> as the type of Christ, and as a member of Christs mystical body, hath his own place. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Because the price of Redemption is holden here as fully payed, and nothing is left unpayed by Christ; therfore the application of the purchased mercy must be granted; for Christ, here speaking, having declared his performance of his part of the Covenant, from <hi>ver.</hi> 6. to <hi>ver.</hi> 11. doth now require the performance of promised kindness and mercy to him and his mystical body, saying, <hi>Withhold not thy tender mercies from me, O Lord: let thy loving kindness, and thy truth continually preserve me</hi>; and this is a standing petition of the Mediatour, in favour of his afflicted mystical body in all generations. 2. The unchangableness of Gods loving kindness, and truth of promises made in his Covenant, is a solid ground of assurance that the Lord wil not withhold his tender mercies from the afflicted believer; for upon this ground do the parts of his petition run; <hi>Withhold not thy tender mercies from me, and let kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and truth continually preserve me.</hi> 3. Albeit the troubles which are inflicted, be drawn on by sin, and be the effects of just wrath for sin, yet are they also the object of tender mercies, when the afflicted do present both their troubles &amp; their sins, which deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them before Gods merciful eye; for here a reason of hoping for tender mercy<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> is brought from both trouble and sin lying on, <hi>for innumerable evils have compassed me about, and mine iniquities have taken hold on me.</hi> 4. By vertue of the intercession of Christ, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very believer may take up the same supplication in Christs name, and present it in his own behalf unto God, in the time of trouble and necessity; for as <hi>David</hi> might make this use of it, as one of the members of the mystical body: so may all the rest of believers al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so; because Christ the Mediatour doth own all the sins of all his redeemed ones as his own, as made his by consent to have them imputed unto him, and hath born the punishment therof so much as may and doth satisfie justice for them. Therfore Christ in the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:41635:135"/>
behalf of his redeemed ones, and every believer in Christ for that respect may expect continual preservation by the loving kindness and truth of God laid in pawn for it by the Covenant, when they have recourse to God in the time when trouble and guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness doth both set on at once; for the reason of the prayer is so conceived, as it may fit both the Mediatour interceding for his mystical body, and every wearied soul also who is fled to God through Christ by faith in him, that he may find his outgate and deliverance in, with, and for Christ, <hi>Let thy loving kindness and truth continually preserve me; for innumerable evils have compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed me about, mine iniquities have taken hold on me.</hi> 6. Nothing can so empty a man, and lay him low, and fil him with confusion of face, as his sin pursuing him; <hi>Mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up.</hi> 7. When all that is a mans own, as natural strength, wit, or courage doth fail; yet God doth not fail and faith doth not fail; <hi>For here when it is come to this, my heart faileth me,</hi> Faith stands up, and in prayer pleadeth for mercy and kindness upon this very reason, because the heart doth fail. 8. As the strait is great, and the burden heavy, and the creature weak: so is the delivery and help neer at hand, <hi>Be pleased, O Lord, to deliver me: O Lord, make haste to help me.</hi>

               <p>From this prayer that the rest of the godly may have comfort by his delivery, which delivery he doth confidently expect; <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. As every mercy to every believer giveth a proof of Gods readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to shew the like mercy to all believers, when they stand in need; so should every mercy shewn to any of the number, being known to the rest, be made the matter and occasion of magnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord, <hi>Let all those that seek thee rejoyce and be glad in thee.</hi> 2. The godly whose property it is to be partakers of the affliction of Christ with others, and to seek God, and to wait for the Lords way of delivery, and do love the safety of his people, shal have reason to rejoyce and praise God continually for new evidences of his mercy to his own; <hi>Let all those that seek thee rejoyce and be glad in thee: let such as love thy salvation, say continually, The Lord be magnified.</hi> 3. It is an usual condition of the godly, before they be delivered out of any difficulties, to be made once sensible of their own weakness, emptiness, and necessities; as here, <hi>I am poor and needy.</hi> 4. It is an ordinary exercise of the afflicted, to be despised of the world, and contemned; and this also is a tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to move them to mistake their own condition before God; for so doth the Psalmist propound the matter before God; <hi>But</hi> (saith he) <hi>I am poor and needy.</hi> 5. Whatsoever the world or sense and false suggestions do say of the afflicted, yet faith gives ground of assurance that our base and mean condition is so far from making us loathsome to God, that by the contrary the lower we are brought, the more we are in his heart and estimation; <hi>Yet the Lord thinketh upon me</hi>; and Gods respecting of us, may easily make up our loss of respect among men. 6. When the believer hath fastned his faith, he may expect shortly his relief, <hi>Thou art my help and my deliverer,</hi> saith he, and then <hi>make no tarrying, O my God.</hi>

The Lord hath a way of delivery, not only from trouble, that a man fal not in it, and not only of delivering from trouble, by removing of the trouble, but also a way of delivery, when the trouble is yet remaining; to wit, by sustaining the man, comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of him, saving of him from any harm by the trouble, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him good by the trouble, quieting his mind by patient sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission unto God under the trouble, <hi>&amp;c.

Albeit the godly be brought very low, yet shal he not perish, <hi>The Lord will preserve him and keep him alive</hi>; and this is the second reason of comfort; albeit he faint, and have soul-swarses now and then, yet shal spiritual life be kept in him. 6. None of the godly mans afflictions shal hinder or take away his begun blessedness, even in this world; <hi>He shal be blessed on the earth</hi>: and this is the third reason of comfort; if it may be for Gods glory and the mans good, this temporal life shall be preserved, and evidences of Gods blessing shal be seen upon him. 7. No persecuter shal drive the godly man from his point, and make him forsake God, or the way of godliness; if he slip in a step, God shal raise him up again; <hi>Thou wilt not deliver him to the wil of his enemies</hi>: and this is the fourth reason of his comfort. 8. The Lord wil strengthen the godly to bear whatsoever trouble he putteth on him; <hi>The Lord wil strengthen him on the bed of languishing</hi>: and this is the fifth reason of his comfort. 9. The Lord shal miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:41635:137"/>
and moderate all the afflictions of the godly, and ease him under his trouble, as tenderly as when a sick persons bed is made the best way that can be for his ease; <hi>Thou shalt make all his bed in his sickness</hi>: and this is the sixth reason of his comfort. 10. The man who may look for all these consolations, and may be judged of charitably, whether it be himself or another, is the man who in the sense of his sins humbleth himself before the Lord, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when he is afflicted, and flieth to Gods mercy: first, to have sins pardoned; and next, to have his trouble removed, as God seeth it fit for his salvation. This is pointed out in <hi>Davids</hi> behaviour under his trouble, of set purpose that he may give the character of the Lords poor man, to whom the foresaid comforts do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, and of whose estate a good construction is to be made; <hi>I said, Lord, be merciful to me, heal my soul, for I have sinned against thee.</hi>

3. The godly have to do not only with open enemies, but with secret false dissemblers also, who wil profess friendship with fair words, when they are following the way of malice, from whose falshood there is no refuge more then from the force of the open enemy, save to fly<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> to God, the Judg of all oppressed people: <hi>If he come to see me, he speaketh vanity</hi>; many fair words, but none of them true. 4.

                  <hi>If he cometh to see me, his heart gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth iniquity to it self; when he goeth abroad he telleth it.</hi> 5.

The lot appointed to Christ, and to all the true members of his mystical body as wel as to <hi>David,</hi> is to find in the time of their trials a hard meeting in the world from the wicked, how many bonds soever of nature, friendship, familiarity, or obligations of the wicked unto the godly intervene, which otherwayes might require better offices; <hi>Yea, mine own familiar friend in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lift up his heel against me.</hi> 8. We must not dwel upon our miseries in time of trouble, as if we had nothing to do, save to weep and mourn, but we should turn our selves to God, and pray to him for mercy, and expect a delivery, as the Psalmist doth here, <hi>But thou, O Lord, be merciful to me, and raise me up.</hi> 9. Albeit it be not fit for every believer, to resolve requiting of their persecuters and enemies, as it was sit to <hi>David</hi> as a Magistrate, and to Christ who is King of Kings, here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented by him; to resolve vengeance, and to execute the same also against their enemies; yet every believer may be assured of this, that what injuries are done to Christ in their person, Christ shal requite their persecuters; for he in his mystical members shal never be so born down, but he shal be raised up again (as he was raised up personally after his personal suffering) <hi>Raise me up, that I may requite them.</hi>

               <p>In the last part of the Psalm in his thanksgiving, presuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that the Psalm was drawn up after the delivery from the trouble which is set forth in the former part. <hi>Whence learne,</hi> 1. Albeit external deliveries from enemies, and success eternal do not alwaies serve for marks of Gods favour (for an ill man in an ill cause may have success for a time) yet when the man is reconciled to God, and the cause which the reconciled man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth against his persecuters, is the Lords cause; in this case if God shal give to his servant either spiritual victory, that the enemy do not so prevail over him, as to drive him from his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous cause; or external victory, and deliverance also from the power of the adversary, together with the spiritual victory; in this case (I say) the word of God, and the work of God concurring, do give evidence not only of Gods favouring the mans person, but also of his favouring the mans cause and carriage in the cause, so as he may say, <hi>By this I know that thou favorest me, because mine enemie doth not triumph over me.</hi> 2. Uprightness is a special means to bring a man through difficulties, and whatsoever infirmities the believer be subject unto, he shal not want comfort, if he keep the conscience of integrity, uprightness, and sincerity; for this is the Psalmists rejoycing, when he looks back upon his former exercise under trouble, <hi>As for me, thou upholdest me in my integrity.</hi> 3. The wise wrastler with tentations, is made at length to see and acknowledge by the experience he hath of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and of Gods help in time of tentation, that all the glory of his standing and bearing out in trouble for righteousness, doth belong to the Lord, <hi>Thou upholdest me in mine integritie.</hi> 4. Experience of Gods gracious bearing out of a believer in time of trial, serveth for a good argument to make him confident of the continuance of Gods favour to him for ever; yea after expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences and victory, God useth to give some measure of perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of his everlasting love toward them that have overcome; as here, <hi>Thou settest me before thy face for ever.</hi> 5. He that gets a

sight of Gods love to him, may knit Gods felt favour in effect with Gods everlasting love decreeing to shew favour, and his ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting love communicating it self to him, and performing the decrees of love touching him, and may behold the course of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting blessings running from eternity before the world, to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting after the world; and the believer having seen it, should ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge this with praise and thanksgiving; as here, <hi>Blessed be the Lord God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting.</hi> 6. He that seeth the course of Gods love to himself, seeth Gods love in conjunction with the rest of the Lords people also, who are joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the same Covenant with him unto God in Christ. <hi>Blessed be the Lord God of Israel,</hi> says the Psalmist, now when he will bless God for his own particular mercy. 7. Fresh experiences of Gods love in a particular trial, especially when the soul is lifted up to the eternal original, and everlasting endurance of it, will make a soul heartily with all his strength give everlasting praise to God, and seal it affectionately again and again, <hi>Blessed be the Lord God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting, Amen, and Amen.</hi>

To find Satan and wicked men, and Gods sad dispensations seeming to speak rejection from God, &amp; to see the glory of the true Religion, and a mans own interest in

The Saints should be so far from separation from the fellowship of the visible Church in the publick exercise of holy ordinances, albeit they know certainly that all are not sound professors who are to joyn with them, that it should be their joy to have multitudes partaking in the use, (at least of some) of the publick means, and such as were not publickly scandalous joyning in all the ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whereby God might be openly honoured, and his elect among them might in Gods own time be converted; for <hi>David went with the multitude, and that to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, and with a multitude that kept holy day.</hi> And this was at the time when King <hi>Saul</hi> and his Courtiers were joyned in the publick ordinances with him, and with <hi>Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi> and other such godly persons: Now what the constitution of the Church visible was in <hi>Sauls</hi> days, in regard of the hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie of professors known to <hi>David,</hi> sundry of <hi>Davids</hi> Psalmes do make evident, and yet for all that he wisheth to have the like oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of worshipping God again, and doth account highly of what he sometimes did enjoy.</p>

of minde; it is a gracious mans part to check him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for this reasonless fit of unbelief<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and to put his conscience to answer for yeilding so far to the tentation; <hi>Why art thou cast down, O my soul?</hi> 2. Mis-belief in a child of God is followed with restlesness of spirit, as a chastisement drawn on by that sin, for which disquieting of himself the man may justly be challenged also, and will not be able to give a reason for it, <hi>Why art thou dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted within me</hi>? 3. The only means of remedying discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and unquietness of minde, is to set faith on work to go to God, and take hold on him, and to cast anchor within the vail, hoping for and expecting relief from him, <hi>Hope thou in God.</hi> 4.

               <p>In the second conflict he turneth him to God, and layeth the case of his discouraged heart before him, labouring to make use of old experience. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1.

Albeit the power of making the means effectual, be not in us, but in the Lords hands, yet must we not cease to use the means rationally still, whereby the Lord useth to convey his efficacious power, and to call to minde experiences, as a good means for recovering of our selves; <hi>My soul is cast down, O God, therefore will I remember thee from the Land of Iordan.</hi> That is, I will aime at comforting my self, by remembring what I have found by experience in several places of <hi>Iudea</hi> of thy goodness to me: and I will look to the holy land, and to the Temple, the place where thy gracious presence is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and where thy honour dwelleth.</p>

As the noise of rain from the clouds raiseth a noise of the inferiour waters and floods; as the raising of brooks doth raise the rivers, and all do shut themselves into a sea; and as the waves of the sea do call one upon another to follow the former at the back: so one grief doth waken another, one tentation doth strengthen another, one affliction augmenteth another, till a sea of troubles raised by a storm be like to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm the man, <hi>All thy waves and thy billows are gone over me.</hi>

               <p>To oppose this new assult, faith puts forth it self the third time, promising to the wrastler what God hath promised to the believer; whereupon he resolveth to plead his cause more hardly, and ply God yet again with prayer more earnestly, that he may prevaile: <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Faith seeth in Gods Word and in by-gone evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his truth manifested in his word, as it were a written or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and commission ready to be given forth in acts of providence for satisfying the believer with so much fresh experience, as may fill him day and night with sense of Gods love and songs of praise, <hi>Yet the Lord will command his loving kindness in the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, and in the night his song shall be with me.</hi> 2.

of his Covenant with us to keep it, to feed it and renew it in all the decays thereof, till it be possessed of unchangeable bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness, the belief whereof is a ground of perseverance in prayer, <hi>My prayer shall be unto the God of my life.</hi> 3.

               <p>In the fourth conflict which he hath chiefly with the mockers of his Religion, and of his cause, and of his trust in God; <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The sharpest part of a believers trial and affliction is, when in his person Religion and Gods glory is mocked; this cruel sort of persecution pierceth deepest in his heart, because it tends to drive the man to desperation, and to make Religion and faith in God out of request, <hi>As with a sword in my bones, mine enemies reproach me.</hi> 2. Continuance of the reproach of godliness, and of the insolency of mockers scorning Religion in the afflicted mans face, in the time when it seemeth that his affliction speaketh desperation of relief, doth greatly encrease the power of the tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the godly mans grief: <hi>A sword in my bones, while they say daily unto me, Where is thy God?</hi> 3. As the battel against discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and unbelief useth to be oftner renewed even after the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever hath gotten the victory once and again, and as the wrastlers weakness useth oftner to be made evident: so the same means and weapons must be oftner used, and we must not be weary to fight on; for, <hi>Why art thou cast down, O my soul,</hi> is now repeated as before; the mis-beleif and disquietness drawn on by mis-belief, must be yet again rebuked, <hi>Why art thou disquieted within me?</hi>

Faith and hope must be set on work against all the disappearances of help, <hi>Hope thou in God</hi>; we must (as it were) be surety to our selves for Gods promises made to us, that they shall be performed; <hi>I shall yet praise him.</hi> 4. As when the Lord doth withdraw both the outward tokens of his favour, and also his inward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation for a time, the countenance of the godly cannot chuse but be heavy, cast down, and look sad like a man that is sick; so when God returneth to comfort, and to owne his own ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther both inwardly and outwardly, or inwardly only; the mans face looketh cheerful, <hi>He is the health of my countenance.</hi> 5. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Lord for a time shall nether remove the outward af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, nor yet inwardly give comfort, yet faith will sustain it self upon the Covenant, and lay its whole weight upon it, and may do it confidently; for it will not sink under the man, nor under his burden, <hi>He is my God.</hi>

As is the longing of the soul after God, when it is at a distance from him: so is the consolation and satisfaction which it findeth after renewed access; and as the supplicant is earnest for renewed sense of fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship: so doth he purpose that the praises of God shal be hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at the receiving of that which he longed for, and also that his faith shal be stronger by the fastning of the bond of the Covenant between him and God more strongly: <hi>I wil praise thee with the harpe, O my God.</hi>

               <p>FOr the confirmation of their faith, they lay forth three argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The first is from the Lords mighty work in driving out the Canaanites, and planting their fathers in <hi>Canaan,</hi> made
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:41635:145"/>
mention of in holy Scripture. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which the Scripture doth give us of Gods working for his people, is as sure, and should be so looked upon by us; as if the people of God who lived in the dayes when these works were done, and who were eye-witnesses thereof, should also rise up from the dead when the Scriptures are read, and testifie unto us, saying: <hi>Of these things we were eye-witnesses,</hi> and we <hi>tell them unto you</hi> for unquestionable truths; for thus much do these words import: <hi>We have heard with our eares, O God, our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have told us what thou didst in their dayes.</hi> 2. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth keep the declarations of Gods work and wil so fresh, and clean and pure from the mixture and superfluitie and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection of humane tradition, that God wil own it as his own proper testimonie, when we bring it before him: <hi>Our eares have heard, O God, what thou didst in the times of old.</hi> 3. Gods old works have new use in all ages, for the furtherance of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers faith, patience and comfort: <hi>Wee have heard what thou didst in times of old,</hi> say the Saints now in trouble; and standing in need of experience of the like works of God for them. 4. Albeit comparison of by-gone better times with ours, doth augment grief and tentation at first; yet when they are well looked upon in their end and use, they serve to comfort us, and confirm our faith, as here the persecuted Kirks use-making of the like condition of the Lords people before them doth teach us. 5. Although Families and Nations were rooted in a Land, like old Oak-trees, and were very long possessors of it; yet God can drive them out of it, by what instruments soever he pleaseth to do it; The work of vanquishing Nations, and subduing of them, and casting out of them, is the Lords work: <hi>Thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand.</hi> And so is the planting of a people in a land, or continuing families in succession: <hi>Thou plantedst our fathers, and castedst out the people.</hi> 6. The Lords part in a work is best seen, when mans part and all that he, as an instrument hath done, or could have done in it, is all declared null; being considered as separate from God, who moved the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments, and did work by them what he pleased: <hi>They got not the land in possession by their own sword, &amp;c.</hi> 7. The fountaine of all good which is done to, or by the Church, is the only meer favour of God and his good pleasure; That they are an incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, a Church planted, fost<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

unto them.</hi> 8. When God sheweth the light of his countenance to a people or person, he wil also shew his power for them; <hi>Thy arm and the light of thy countenance, gave them the land in possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> These two go together.</p>

               </q>
               <p>The second argument for confirmation of the Church, is from the relation between God and her; <hi>Thou art my King, O God, &amp;c. Whence learn,</hi> 1.

Relations between God and his people, do stand constantly in adversity, as wel as in prosperity: The godly in persecution have God for a King to come unto, from whom they may expect all the benefits which Subjects can expect from a potent King, as here the Church saith to God, how ever thou thinkest it fit to put us under the feet of persecuters; yet <hi>Thou art my King, O God.</hi> 3. Whatsoever be the particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of any member of the Church, their prayer should be put forth for the whole body; specially when the persecution is of the whole: <hi>Command deliverance for</hi> Jacob. 4.

                  <pb n="274" facs="tcp:41635:146"/>The third argument to confirm their Faith, is the conscience of their sincere purpose, to give God the glory of inabling them unto all duties, whereunto he hath promised to inable them. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The believer may promise to himself whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God hath promised unto him; hath God promised to give his own people the victory over their enemies? then the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever may promise to himself he shal overcome his persecuters, and through Gods strength be more then a conquerour over them; <hi>Through thee wil we push down our enemies.</hi> If the enemy make head against them after a defeat, the Believer may say, <hi>Through thy Name wil we tread under that rise up against us.</hi> 2. The less confidence me have in our selves or in any thing beside God, the more evidence have we of the sincerity of our faith in God: <hi>For I wil not trust in my bow, neither shal my sword save mee.</hi> 3. It is a proof of sincerity of Faith, to give God as much credit for time to come, as he hath gained to himself, by the evidencing of his truth in time by-gone; <hi>My sword shal not save me: But thou hast saved us, and therfore through thee wil we push down our enemies.</hi> 4. Whosoever doth hate the Lords people, shall be forced to think shame of their enmity one day; <hi>Thou hast put them to shame, that hated us.</hi> 5. The glory which we give to God in prosperity, we should give him the same in our adversity; change of times and dispensations should not change his glory, nor our confidence in him: Though the Church be under foot of men, the Churches God is above all: <hi>In God wil we boast all the day long, and praise thy Name for ever.</hi>

It can stand with the constant love of God to his people, to put them to so hard exercises by va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of troubles; as he may seem not only to break off his former course of kindness towards them, but also to cast them off, and turn against them, by sending sore judgments on them, which ordinarily do speake unto humane sense wrath, and utter wrath; <hi>Thou hast cast off</hi>; yea, and they may seem disappointed of their hoped for protection and assistance from God; <hi>Thou hast put us to shame</hi>: and may lose heart and hand when they go to battel against their enemies in a good cause; <hi>Thou goest not forth with our armies, ver.</hi> 9. and be put to flight in battels, and be made a spoil to their despiteful enemies: <hi>Thou makest us turne back from our enemies, and they that hate us, spoil for themselves. v.</hi> 10. and being destitute of humane help for recovery, may seem to be left in the hand of the enemie, to dispose of them (as it may seem) to his pleasure; <hi>Thou hast given us like sheepe for meat.</hi> And albeit all believers cannot be cut off, yet we may lose the face of a Church or Congregation: <hi>Thou hast scattered us among the Heathen, ver.</hi> 11. and may be made underlings and slaves to oppressors with no apparant advantage to the Lords glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but seeming losse rather; <hi>Thou sellest thy people for nought, and dost not increase thy wealth with their price, ver.</hi> 12. And may be deprived, not only of the common duties of humanity, which may be expected of neighbours, but also be disdained by them, mocked and reproached by them: <hi>Thou makest us a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them that are about us, ver.</hi> 13. And in a word, may be the most despised people under heaven; which as it is the just punishment of the scandalous carriage of the visible Church, when they make Gods name to bereproached among Idolaters and heathen people; So is it the sharpest trial and tentation of the truly godly that can
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:41635:147"/>
be; <hi>Thou makest us a by-word among the heathen, a shaking of the head among the people,</hi> vers. 14. <hi>Learn also,</hi> 2. As Gods presence manifested among his people, and for them in the sight of the world, makes them the most famous, wise, couragious, prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and blessed people in the world: So when God being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked by the wicked behaviour of his professed people, leaveth them, with-draweth his protection from them, wil shew himself angry at them; they become foolish and feeble sheep, a despica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and disdained people above all others; <hi>We turn back from the enemy. Thou hast given us as sheep appointed for meat, a reproach, a scorn, a by-word.</hi> 3. Whatsoever calamity cometh upon us, howsoever, and for whatsoever cause, we may safely take God for the worker of all our woe; albeit the meritorious cause be in our self, the inflicting of the calamity is of the Lord; for there is no trouble in the City which the Lord wil not avow himselfe to be the inflicter of; for here the Prophet puts all upon God, <hi>Thou hast done it,</hi> five or six times. 4. When the visible Church hath drawn on miserie on her self, and God hath inflicted cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities justly on her; it is safer to go to God, and lay before him all his work of justice, and the misery which lieth on us, then to keep it within our brests, or tel it of him to others; He that hath wounded us, is only able to heal us, so doth this example teach us to do. 5. When the visible Church is visited with sad calamities, the true members therof are partakers of the trouble and sorrow, and shame of that condition: <hi>My confusion is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuallly before me,</hi> saith the Psalmist. 6. It is not very soon that the Church is delivered out of her trouble, when once she falleth in it; there is a time wherein it is continued: <hi>My confusion is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually before me, and the shame of my face hath covered me,</hi> ver. 15.7. When the enemy doth reproach Religion and righteousness, because of the calamity of the godly; the more is spoken of Gods respect to the godly, and their cause, the more the enemie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth and putteth the godly to shame; and so (while Gods dispensation seemeth to speak the contrary) it seemeth to be but their own confusion for the godly to speak of God, or godliness, and righteousness of their cause. This is a sad case, <hi>The shame of my face hath covered me, for the voice of him that reproacheth, and blasphemeth, by reason of the enemie and the avenger</hi>

               <p>In the third place, the godly do professe for all that is said, their stedfastnesse in the profession of their faith for which they were persecuted. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. It is the duty of the Lords people, whatsoever trouble or persecution they shall fall into, to be stedfast in the profession of the true Religion, and in every point of controverted truth: <hi>All this is come upon us, yet have we not forgotten thee.</hi> 2. As the maintaining of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted truth must flow from faith in God, and love to him, entertaining the affectionate remembrance of Gods kindnesse, whatsoever change of dispensation they shall feel: So the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing from a point of truth in time of trouble, is a forgetting of God who is but hiding himself for a while, till the trial be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected; Therefore say the faithful, <hi>All this is come upon us, yet have we not forgotten thee</hi>: 3. As the Lord hath been pleased to enter into Covenant with his Church, and to make the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant a sanctified means for keeping his people more stedfast in their duty; So should his people make conscience of keeping Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant made with God, and of remaining stedfast in the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of every duty whereunto they stand bound therein, that when they give accompt thereof, they may say with comfort, <hi>We have not dealt falsly in thy Covenant.</hi> 4.

                     <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>

<pb n="278" facs="tcp:41635:148"/>
Covenants, wherein man and man are the parties, and God only judge and witnesse; but are such Covenants as God is also a party therein, to whom a people is so much the more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, as they are sworn to keep his Law, and therefore such Covenants are called Gods Covenant: <hi>We have not dealt falsly in thy Covenant.</hi> 5. No excuse from hazard of trouble, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution can guard the conscience, to shift or passe from the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of God: Nothing can make us give a comfortable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of our carriage in relation to the Covenant, save upright and streight dealing before God; <hi>We have not dealt falsly in thy Covenant.</hi> vers. 17. 6. The Lord can procure more honour to himself in the time of the persecution of his scattered people by the constancy of his Martyrs, and suffering Saints in their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen profession and maintenance of his truth before their perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuters; then when the visible Church lived in prosperity, and scandalized their neighbours by their ill behaviour, as this expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of scattered <hi>Israel</hi> maketh evident. 7. A good conscience doth much sweeten affliction in the time of trial, as here appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. 8. It is necessary for making a man constant in the outward profession of truth in the time of persecution, that his heart be established by grace, that his heart be fixed, trusting in the Lord; These shall be born through, who may say, <hi>Our heart is not turned back.</hi> 9. It is necessary to watch over our severall acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, lest by little and little in particular passages we be drawn aside from our walking with a streight foot toward the Gospel; and lest the heart be stollen away by little and little from the truth; therefore these two must be joyned together in our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour: <hi>That neither our heart be turned back, neither our steps decline from the Lords way,</hi> vers. 18. 10. Albeit the Lord for perfecting the full triall of the faith of his people should put them in the power of most cruel Tyrants, and in daily danger of losing their life, yet should they choose to suffer all extremity of torments, and death it self, rather then to depart from the truth; for so did the Lords approved witnesses before us: <hi>Though God did break them sore in the place of Dragons, and cover them with the shadow of death,</hi> v. 19. 11. In the time of trial concerning Religion, two sorts of sins are to be eschewed. The one is the passing from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny point of the truth of doctrine or divine ordinances; The other is the practising of any point of false worship of another instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then what is the Lords; Whether under pretence of offering it to the true God, or with profession unto another God; for both these are to be eschewed, because the first sort of sin is a forgetting of the
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:41635:148"/>
name of God: The other is, <hi>a stretching out of our hands to a strange god.</hi> 12. The Lord who searcheth the depth of a mans heart, will make speciall search for corrupters of Religion, and depravers of divine Doctrine, worship or ordinances, and all sorts of idolatry, whatsoever excuses or pretences be used for the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louring or covering of the same: <hi>If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands to another god, shall not God search this out?</hi> v. 20. 13. In time of persecution for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; nothing can counter balance the terrours and allurements of the persecuters, and make a man stedfast in the cause of God, save the fear of God, and love to God setled in the heart; For the reason of the Saints stedfastnesie in this Psalme is, <hi>because God would have searched out their sinne,</hi> if they had done other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways; for <hi>he knoweth the secrets of the hearts,</hi> v. 21. 14. Such as resolve to bear out the profession of the truth, must resolve to give their life for the maintenance of it: <hi>We are killed all the day long.</hi> 15. It is ordinary for the world to hate the servants of God, and true Saints, more for their faithfulnesse to God, and uprightnesse in his service, then for any other cause; <hi>For thy sake are we killed.</hi> 16. It is mercy to us, that when God might punish us for our sins, he doth make our correction honourable, and our troubles to be for a good cause; <hi>For thy sake are we kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</hi> 17. Although all the hours of the day the persecuters were taking and killing some of our Brethren, the Saints for their faith in God, and fidelity in his service; yet that must not divert the rest from following of the truth, and professing of true Religion; How long soever the Lord continue the persecution and our trouble for his cause, we should resolve constantly to endure to the end; <hi>Yea, for thy cause are we killed all the day long,</hi> vers. 22.</p>

                  <pb n="280" facs="tcp:41635:149"/>In the last part of the Psalme, the Psalmist in behalf of the Church doth pray to be delivered from the cruelty of persecuters; and being in bitternesse of spirit for anguish and grief, doth vent his present sense of Gods dispensation, yet corrected by faith; <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Albeit the Lord who watcheth over <hi>Israel</hi> be most vigilant for every one of his children, and never slumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nor sleepeth, but is still upon his work, his glorious work of preparing his jewels for eternal life, even when he putteth his people in the furnace of affliction by hottest persecution, (for then in special he is about to glorifie himself and his Saints also in the triall of their precious faith, and is bringing to the view of men and Angels, that he hath a people who do love him better then their own lives, and who will endure any misery rather then deny any point of his truth committed unto them;) yet such is the strength of natural senses and affections, such is the partiality of self-love in carnal disputation about Gods providence, when he putteth his people to so sad sufferings for no fault done to their persecuters; and such is the power of Satans tentations, helped on by humane infirmity, and perturbation of passions, that God is looked on as if he misregarded the case of his own people, and took no more care of them then a sleeping man doth of his busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and this is imported in this expression; <hi>Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord?</hi> 2. Faith doth not allow not subscribe unto carnall sense, but in presenting the objections thereof unto God, doth really refute them. First, in that by prayer it go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to God, who is the hearer of the most secret sighes of suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants, at whatsoever time, night or day, or in whatsoever place opened up unto him. Secondly, by intreating him to refute the slander and calumny which carnal sense, and suggested tentations did put upon him, <hi>Awake, arise</hi>; that is, let it be seen by the manifesting of thy justice and mercy, as thou usest to do by thy open working for us, that thou takest notice of our sufferings, and of our persecuters violence. Thirdly, by avowing that such misregarding of his own cause and servants, as sense and tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did vent, is inconsistent with his nature, Covenant, Promises, and practices towards his people; for, <hi>Why sleepest thou,</hi> is as much as, it is not possible that thou sleepest; and <hi>why</hi> here is not a word of quarrelling, but a word of denying, that any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son can be given for such a thought, as <hi>God sleepeth.</hi> Fourthly, by avowing faith and hope of God manifesting himself in due time, for deciding of the controversie between them and their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuters; for what he prayeth for, he believeth to obtain. His
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:41635:149"/>
prayer being according to the revealed will of God: and <hi>Awake why sleepest thou, O Lord,</hi> is as much as I believe, Lord, that thou wilt indeed let us and the world see that thou art not sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all this our hard sufferings for thy sake; and therefore I pray thee shew thy self early. 3. As tentation, if it cannot fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en upon us any thought of Gods careless misregarding of us in our sad sufferings; yet will it suggest suspicions of Gods wrath, indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, hatred, rejection, and reprobation of us; So faith will study to dispell this mist, and quench this fiery dart by prayer also; <hi>Cast us not off for ever,</hi> giving assurance, that albeit there were wrath in their exercise, yet it shall be but for a short time, and shall not be perpetuall. 4. As tentation, if it cannot fasten up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us suspicion of Gods hatred of us, and of his purpose to cast us off for ever; yet it will suggest that God is pursuing us for some sinne which we know not of, that he is wroth with us in suffering persecuters to prevaile and to oppresse us, (when in the mean-time he is glorifying himself, and his truth in us, edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others by our constancy in such a point of truth, and by our patience in bearing the crosse, to the advantage both of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent age and posterity:) So faith must study to dispel this mist also, and to quench this fiery dart as well as the former by reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this to be the cause; for it is no token of Gods pursuing sin in wrath, when God giveth us grace, not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for his Names sake, and the Gospels; When he maketh us to be his publick Martyrs and witnesses for his truth, some in one degree of Martyrdome, some in another; When he maketh the spirit of glory, and of God to rest upon us, and so blesseth us, that when on the persecuters part he is evil spoken of, he is on our part glorified. This (I say) is no token of wrath, no token of pursuing us for our sinnes. Therefore albeit sense calls this a hiding of his face, yet faith will not admit these causes which might import wrath: For, <hi>Wherefore hidest thou thy face?</hi> is in the terms of faith, as much as, Albeit it be true, that we have sinned, and <hi>thou seemest to hide thy face</hi>; yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not admit this thought, that this thy dealing with us is in wrath; I see no reason why I should expound thy dispensation so; yea, the very question <hi>wherefore,</hi> importeth that the Psalmist cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend upon any suggested reason of this sort, to prove the hiding of Gods face, as sense would say; and therefore he expecteth the Lord will shew forth tokens of his love and good will to them in due time. 5. As when these tentations are refuted by faith, long-lasting trouble meeting with infirme flesh, doth hold up
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:41635:150"/>
the complaint of poor frail man, not being able to endure trouble long, weak nature is ready to think that it is forgotten or laid aside, and striketh still upon its own string of lamentation, whatsoever faith doth speak to the contrary, whether it have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or not; So faith must do its office, and that is, when it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not stop complaining, it must lay forth before God in prayer the lamenter, and his lamentation to finde pity; <hi>Why forgettest thou our affliction, and our oppression?</hi> 6. All the reason that a poor persecuted and afflicted person can bring from himself, to plead pity when he lamenteth his case to the Lord, is his own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, emptinesse, low condition, near drawing to discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, fainting and dying; For, <hi>Our soul is bowed down to the dust.</hi> 7. The godly soul under persecution, resolveth never to yield to the will of the persecuters, nor quit the Lords cause, but to lie supplicant at Gods feet from day to day, and there to die, if it be his will to delay or deny outward relief. Thus much the gesture of the supplicant speaks; <hi>Our belly cleaveth to the earth.</hi> 8. Though the Believer do finde no reason in himself of his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for relief, yet he findeth reasons sufficient to give him hope in God; As first, The Lords Soveraign power and place to help such weak creatures as come to him in their need; <hi>Arise for our help, arise a help for us</hi>: Secondly, the office of a Redeemer, wherewith he cloathed himself in the Messiah Christ Jesus; in the paction of whose redemption, and payment of the price of it, and begun and perfected accomplishment of it, every Believer hath undoubted interest and right unto all particular deliveries out of all straits, as branches, and appendices of the great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of their souls unto eternall life. And this is hinted at in these words; <hi>Arise for our help, and redeem us.</hi> Thirdly, the purchased, promised, and constantly running forth, and offered mercy of God to Believers, looseth all objections and doubts arising from our sins, unworthinesse, and ill-deserving: For, <hi>(Redeem us for thy mercies sake)</hi> importeth so much.</p>

Because even the true members of the Church, whose praise is not of men but of God, are in this life intangled in affections to their old wayes and corruption of manners; Therefore every one hath need to renounce and forget more and more their old lusts and entice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the world, which is a very true fruit, and necessary evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their hearing in faith, <hi>Forget also</hi> (saith he) <hi>thine own people, and thy fathers house.</hi> 4.

Whatsoever inherent graces the Saints have, and how beautiful soever they be; yet they have need of a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which may hide their imperfections, and beautifie them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God; to wit, the imputed righteousness of Christ, the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of the Church, who only hath this garment to sel, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.18. and though it be bought without mony and without price, yet it is very rich; for whatsoever either nature or art can furnish to set it forth, is but a shadowing similitude of it, <hi>Her cloathing is of wrought gold.</hi> 9.

The main part of the inheritance of Christs subjects is no earthly thing, but his very best blessing, such as he gave to <hi>Iacob</hi> above <hi>Esau; Their inheritance shall be the excellency of</hi> Jacob. 4. The fountaine of Christs care for all his subjects, is common to them and to <hi>Iacob,</hi> and that is his love, <hi>The excellency of Iacob whom he loved, shall be their inheritance. Selah.</hi>

               <p>From the fourth reason of Christs praise taken from his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous triumphing over all his enemies and ours when he ascended to heaven; <hi>Learn,</hi> 1.

Albeit the Lord doth shew his glory in the works of creation, and is shining day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the works of providence also; yet in the work of redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, conversion and salvation of souls<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> his glory is manifested
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:41635:161"/>
far more; for here, <hi>praise, praise, praise,</hi> and the fourth time <hi>praise</hi> is called for. 2. When believers in Jesus Christ do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider how he abased himself to assume our nature, how he payed the ransome for us as surety, how he did encounter and fight with all our enemies, and being victorious in our name, ascended in our nature with the shout of the victory, and sound of the trumpet of the triumpher, they cannot chuse but see reasons of praising joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully the glorious Godhead of Jesus Christ, and of singing praises to him as God again and again. 3. Of all Nations of the earth, the Jewes have the first place, priviledge, and prerogative, most bonds with, and interests in Jesus Christ; for he delivered them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> setled them in <hi>Canaan,</hi> held house among them in a Tabernacle, answered them by Oracle out of the A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> and in this song may all they joyn with the Jewes, who have embraced Jesus for their King. 4. Christ is so King over the Jews, as he also extendeth his kingdom over all the earth, not only in regard of his power in a common manner, but in regard of his special grace gathering in subjects out of all parts of the world, til he have the ful number brought in and saved, he, he only is the true Catholick King, <hi>for God is the King of all the earth.</hi> 5 As none can praise God, or praise Christ sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, who do not understand the reasons for which they should praise; so he that praiseth understanstingly, cannot chuse but praise affectionatly, therfore saith he, <hi>Sing ye praises with understanding.</hi>

               <p>From the sixth reason of Christs praise taken from the keeping a church among the Gentiles, for gathering the redeemed out of all Tongues and Languages, and reigning among them as King of Saints, and author of holinesse; <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. To the end that Faith may find footing and a Rock to rest upon, we must in all the promises, works and praises of Christ still remember that as he is now very man, so is he also eternally God, and that no man reasonably or with understanding can praise him as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer and perfecter of what is spoken of him in Scripture, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he acknowledg him to be God; therefore is Christ eight times in this Psalm calleth God, beside the ascribing unto him works proper to God only; and twice he is called by the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:41635:162"/>
name of Jehovah the Lord; and in this verse God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head is twice acknowledged in him, as King of the church among the Gentiles; <hi>God reigneth over the heathen, God sitteth upon the throne of his holinesse.</hi> 2 Because the summe of Christs Kingdome is holiness, and his work is to teach, prescribe and command holiness, to take away sin, and powerfully to apply and work in his owne redeemed ones holinesse, and to continue in his actual governing of his Subjects, til he have made all and every one of the redeemed perfectly holy; therefore is his throne in a special manner called <hi>the throne of holinesse; God sitteth upon the throne of his holinesse.</hi>

               <p>From the seventh reason of Christs praise, taken from his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting of great men of the earth, (as Kings and Princes) and bringing them to the obedience of the faith and union with the true church; <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Albeit oft times it is seen, that not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny rich, noble, or potent are called; yet God for his own glory is from time to time bringing in some of them, and when it may glorifie his name, shal bring in and perfect what is promised, and prophesied here; <hi>The princes of the people are gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> 2. It is a point of Christs praise in the conversion of men, that his omnipotency maketh men voluntary Subjects, and to come in to him as by invincible power on his part, so also delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately with a free election, and hearty consent of wil on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The church of the Jews is the mother-church, wherof <hi>Abraham</hi> and the godly Jews yea and Christ himself were Members; The church of the Jewes is the Olive-treee, whereunto all the converts of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles are ingraffed, gathered, and made one people with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and the faithful among the Jewes; <hi>The Princes of the people are gathered together, the people of the God of</hi> Abraham. 4. The unity of the church standeth in the union of the Spirit, under the service of the only true God, and in conjunction with his people, for the union of Jew and Gentile, is <hi>the gathering together of the Princes of the people to the God of</hi> Abraham.
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:41635:162"/>
5. As there is a necessity of the union of Jewes and Gentiles in one visible Christian Church, because it is promised and prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied that it shall be so; So there is reason to wish for the more evident union of them; that they may be as eminently consociate as ever the Christian Churches were, (either in the Apostles time, or in the Christian Emperors time,) in a general Assembly or oecumenical councel; for that there is at least a possibility of an oecumenical councel, or a general assembly of Jewes and Gentiles in this world under Christ their King. This place makes it plaine, because after it is foretold that there shall be such a union of all the people of the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Jewes and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, as <hi>their princes shal be gathered together,</hi> He takes away the chief ground of a great objection which may be made from the discord and disagreement of the Princes of the world; some of them being averse altogether from the Christian Religion, some of them from the true Religion of Christ, and all of them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most dissenting one from another, and warring one against ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; whereby now for many years the gathering of an oecume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical councel hath not been possible. He meeteth this objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Text, saying, <hi>For the shields of the earth belong unto God,</hi> that is, the hearts and power of all the Kings of the earth are in the Lords hand, and he hath the disposing of shields, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and ammuintion, with all their commanders and rulers in the world, and therefore can make them serviceable for the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est conjunction and union of his visible church, which can be for his glory in this world, as he sees <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If the enemies of the church could foresee their own foul retreat, they would not advance or make assault against the church; for now when they did see matters, as they were indeed, <hi>they were troubled, and hasted away.</hi> 6. Besides the mischief which God bringeth upon the churches enemies, when he begins to plead by way of judgment against them, he

As it is a good thing pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently to wait on Gods loving kindnesse in the use of the means, when troubles and dangers do come; so it is a good thing for the godly after receiving the fruit of their faith, hope and patience, to observe the grace gotten of God, which made them to meditate upon and look unto his loving kindnesse: and so to strengthen themselves in their resolutions, to follow this blessed course here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, as the faithful do here: <hi>We have thought of thy loving kindnesse, O God, in the midst of thy Temple.</hi>

Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit it be lawfull for Gods people to rejoyce when the enemies are punished; yet had they need to take heed to their spirit, that their joy be not fleshly, for satisfaction gotten to their vindictive passions; but spiritual, for the declaration of Gods kindnesse to his people, and just indignation at the wickednesse of their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious persecuters: <hi>Let them be glad, because of thy judgements.</hi>

How dark and difficult soever the mystery of the Gospel be to the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall world; yet to the man of experience it is plain, sweet and comfortable; and a man of experience as he is best seen in that matter, so is he most willing, heartily to communicate it to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; <hi>I will open</hi> (saith he) <hi>my dark saying upon the harp</hi>: Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating his delight in the doctrine.</p>

                  <hi>Ver. 5.</hi> Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, <hi>when</hi> the iniquity of my heels shall compasse me about?</q>
               <p>After this Preface he uttereth his parable and dark saying, the substance whereof is this: I am so perswaded of the favour of God now reconciled to me by the blood of the Covenant, that neither do I need to fear by-past sins, nor any trouble which can come on me hereafter: And this, I say, to let all men know that this blessednesse may be attained by every man, who shall acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his sinnes, and embrace the offers of grace made by God with his directions unto life, as I have done. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. What God has spoken in his word of the blessednesse of the man that is justified by faith, every true believer may finde, and may attain to be fully assured of their perseverance unto eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life; for here is a proof and example of it in the Psalmists person. 2. This Doctrine of the unspeakable peace of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever reconciled to God through the blood of the Covenant, is a point of truth which the world is ignorant of, and hardly will believe: No wonder therefore he did call it before, and here uttereth it as a <hi>parable and dark saying.</hi> 3. A Believer after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, must neither exempt himself from danger of sinning, nor from giving daily accompt of his carriage unto God, nor from challenges for sin, nor from ordinary chastisements for sin, nor
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:41635:167"/>
from heavy troubles and ill days which he may meet with; whether by Gods immediate hand for his correction, or by the persecuters of godlinesse for his further triall, exercise and train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of faith; for here the Psalmist presupposes that evill days will come: he presupposeth that every sin or iniquity of every action and passage of his life, shall leave behinde it an impression of guiltinesse to be taken notice of thereafter, like the print of a mans foot when he lifts his heel and walketh forward; he presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth after remission of sin, after the daily exercise of repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, after frequent intimation made of remission of sin, and that oftner from day to day repeated, a man may be brought back in the day of trouble to an accompt for altogether, and old reckonings may be raked up again by the troubled conscience, and by the accuser of the Brethren, and that God will be ruling the business for the further glory of the riches of his grace, and further good of his exercised childe; for here the Psalmist foreseeth, and speaketh of his looking for <hi>days of evill, and of the iniquity of his heels compassing him about,</hi> as what shall or may befall him. 4. Faith in the Messiah Jesus Christ, is able to make a man, not only at length to triumph over sin and misery, over the curse of the Law, and condemnation, or trouble and persecution, but also before trouble come in humble and solid confidence to be fearless for what can come, and to look all possible evils out of countenance; <hi>Wherefore should I fear in the dayes of evil<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> &amp;c.</hi> 5. Albeit it be possible when it cometh to push of pike, and when the man is yoked in the conflict with troubles from without, and challenges for his sinnes within, that the strongest in faith may finde himself not a little afraid; yet when he considereth the ground laid down for settling of his faith, to wit, the truth of the covenant, the merit of the Mediatours sacrifice, and the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, riches and immutability of Gods love and grace, with the Psalmist he may confidently professe and acknowledge, that he hath no reason to be feared for what Satan or the conscience may threaten him with; for this also is imported in <hi>wherefore</hi> should <hi>I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of my heels shall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe me about?</hi> which is as much as if he had said, whatsoever may be my weaknesse, and exercise in trial; yet I know there is no just reason why I should fear condemnation, or to be debarred from the possession of full blessednesse, by whatsoever possibly can come unto me.</p>

               <p>In the third place, the Believer preferreth this his blessed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to whatsoever either riches or honour or any earthly thing can yield to any man. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The blessedness of the Believer, and the glory of faith is best seen, when the vanity of all earthly happinesse and worldly gloriation in any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side God is discovered and compared with the condition of the Believer, therefore are <hi>they that trust in their wealth,</hi> brought in comparison with the Believer here. 2. In whatsoever men do count their felicity to stand, in that they put their confidence, and do glory in it, as here is presupposed: They that count riches their happinesse, <hi>They trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches.</hi> 3. The weaknesse of all worldly things to make a man blessed doth best appear when death com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> for when the time thereof is come, no rich man can help himself, nor yet joyning his riches with his brothers riches, can help his brother, either by lengthening his life and suspending death temporall, or by recovering him from death when he dieth<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 
                  <hi>None can by any means redeem his brother.</hi> 4. All men are Gods prisoners of warre, his captives, and liable by justice to death tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral &amp; eternal; and there is no delivery from death, whether tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral or eternal, but by paying a ransome unto God, which is impossible for a meer man to pay; <hi>None can give to God a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some for his brother.</hi> 5. We are not redeemed with silver or gold, or any perishing thing; our ransome must be of greater value then a meer man can pay, that is a man, and no more: <hi>The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of a mans soul is precious,</hi> and it ceaseth for ever. 6. Not so much as this worldly life can be perpetuated, by whatsoever wealth, or riches, or humane ability can do; far lesse can the life of God, and that blessednesse in heaven be purchased by any meer

               <p>He compareth the gloriation of the Believer with the condition of those who are not only rich, but also honourable, and Lords of great rents, fair lands, houses and heritages; and he doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the blessednesse of the Believer to their condition also: <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Albeit experience doth teach that death is common to men of all rankes, wise and foolish, rich and poor, and all; yet men are so besotted, as when they see this, they do not consider it, that they might not place their happinesse in any thing, wherefrom they may be separated by death: <hi>The worldly man seeth the wise man die, and also the foolish.</hi> He sees also that many rich men do leave their goods they know not to whom; <hi>They leave their wealth to others</hi>: and yet for all this their seeing the mortality and the folly of mortall men dying before them, they that survive a little do not draw wisdome from this obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, but dream they shall deceive death, and make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves some way eternall; they think to perpetuate their name in their posterity by their heritages and the honours of their great families: <hi>Their inward thought is, that their houses shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue for ever, and their dwelling places to all generations. They call their lands after their own names.</hi> 2. The cause of this folly is his deceived heart, avd vain conceits and imaginations, which by death are blown away; <hi>Their inward thought is to eternize themselves. Neverthelesse, man being in honour, abideth not</hi>; or doth not attain his fancied eternity. 3. The blessedness of the wealthy, potent and honourable man, as it is not permanent:

Though the observation of the folly of predecessours should make the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity wise; yet few are found father-better, or father-wiser; but fools follow fools in a race, and folly wil not want a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trone so long as fools are gone before: <hi>This their way is their folly, yet their posterity approve their sayings.</hi> 6.

<pb n="319" facs="tcp:41635:169"/>
shaketh the faith of the godly sometimes, when they see the flourishing prosperity of the wicked, and their own daily afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but this should not move the godly, or make them suspect themselves to be in a wrong course, and the ungodly in a better way: <hi>Be not thou afraid when one is made rich.</hi> 2. The consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the shortness both of our temporal calamity and of the ungodly mans prosperity, both which do end at death, is the way to overcome the foresaid tentation; For, <hi>When he dieth, he shall carry nothing away, his glory shall not descend after him.</hi> It is not so with the godly, whose glory and happiness meets him at death. 3. A mans own self-deceiving heart, measuring all hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness by a mans present outward condition in the world, and hearkning to the flatterie of fools about him, who use to currie the favour of the wealthy, and love to have the like condition themselves, is the cause why the miserable man is kept stil in a golden dream, as if he were happy: <hi>Though while he lived, he blessed his soule; and men will praise thee when thou dost well to thy self</hi>; that is, when thou takest a life of it while thou mayest have it; yet he and they are altogether deceived. 4. The ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at their death shal go the way the ungodly went before them, to the place of darkness and disconsolation, being separate from God and his Saints, and from all blessedness, and shal never have comfort in their miserable estate for ever; <hi>He shall go to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his fathers</hi>: and what shal become of such wretches? <hi>They shall never see light</hi>; that is, they shal never see the meanest appearance of any joy or comfort. 5. It is not honour, but want of understanding, want of saving faith and wisdome, to provide for eternal life, that puts man down from his excellency, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barreth him from blessedness; <hi>Man that is in honor, and understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not,</hi> is the man here set at nought, and declared to be farre from true blessedness. 6. Whatsoever natural excellency be in man above the beasts; yet sin hath put him so far down, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he get saving knowledge of God, and be reconciled to him, he is in no better condition, at least when he dieth, then a beast; <hi>Man that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beast that perisheth.</hi>

                  <p>This Psalme is a citing of the visible Church before God, the Judg of all the earth, (who at last shal judg all flesh in the day of judgment, and shall take vengeance on the wicked,) to compeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the tribunal of God; now in time while mercy may be had, and now then timeously to consider the Lords controversie against the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in his Church, that they may repent and he saved.

Secondly the citation of the partie, that is, the visible Church, with the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, <hi>v.</hi> 4, 5.6. Thirdly, there is a challenge of self-work-justisticiaries, legalists, and formal cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monialists, who did rest upon outward good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, and upon the outward discharge of the ordinances, as if the sacrifices of the law or any performance of extetnal duties had been suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to expiate sin, and justifie a man, <hi>v.</hi> 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. Fourthly, there is a direction unto them how to come off their legal righteousness, and carnal way of worship, and to turn themselvs to the right way of worshipping God in spirit and truth, <hi>vÂ·</hi> 14, 15. Fifthly, there is a challenge of those who were grosly wicked, <hi>v.</hi> 16, 17, 18, 19.20, 21.

               <p>From the description of the terrour of the Lord coming to judg his visible Church, for the slighting of the means of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and loosness of life and conversation; <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. As the Lord is to judg the whole world one day, so in a special and most exact manner wil he judg those that draw neer to him in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of true Religion, as this whole Psalm holdeth forth. 2. This advantage have they who live in the visible Church, they are warned of the judgment ere it come: for, as many other places of Scripture, so this Psalm is an express warning piece to the Church to prepare for judgment. 3. The terrible process of the day of Gods severe judgment, being wel meditated upon, is a special means to waken mens consciences to take course about their sins in time, that they may be pardoned, and their persons reconciled, which is the scope of the whole doctrine delivered in this Psalm. 4. The mystery of the great and terrible day of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral judgment is to be learned from the Scriptures, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press predictions thereof in Gods word: The authority, weight, certainty and efficacy whereof flowes from, and depends upon God almighty only; <hi>The mighty God,</hi> even <hi>the Lord hath spoken.</hi> 5. God Almighty the Sovereign Judg of all the earth hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, that all who ever took life, in whatsoever time or place they have lived in the world, shal compear befote his Majesty in the appointed time, <hi>The Lord hath spoken, and called the earth, from the rising of the Sun, unto the going down thereof.</hi> 6. The true visible Church where Gods ordinances are set up, as he hath appointed, where his word is purely preached, is the most beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful thing under heaven, and there is Gods glory set forth, and manifested more clearly then in all the Lords handy work beside in heaven or earth; Therefore is the place of the Lords Temple here so highly commended; and <hi>Sion called the perfection of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> because of the glory of God sundry wayes revealed there; <hi>Out

of Sion God hath shined,</hi> saith he, in regard of the clear manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station of his wil, specially in the matter now in hand about the day of judgment. 7. Men wil take no heed unto what the word of the Lord declareth, til the authority, supremacy, om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency and justice of God the Judg be apprehended by them, and the great day of his terrible judgment be looked upon as a thing which shal most certainly come to pass at the time appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; Therefore is it said, <hi>Our God shal come and shall not keep si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</hi> 8. So many as are reconciled with God, and have closed uprightly with him in the Covenant of Grace, may look upon the day of judgment without terrour or perplexity; yea, and with comfort and confident hope to find the Judg gracious to them according to the Tenour of the Covenant, even their God: <hi>Our God,</hi> saith the Prophet <hi>shall come.</hi> 9. Look how fearful and terrible the Lord did shew himself at the giving out of the Law, no less terrible shal he be in the execution thereof, in the day of judging all those whose sins shal be found not pardoned before: <hi>A fire shal devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him.</hi>

What shal be the course that the Judg shal follow about those who have not heard of him, or who have heard of him, and lived without the Church, is not the main matter which the Lords people should enquire for; but this is their part to know, to wit, what concerneth themselves; therefore doth the Lord say no more here but, <hi>Hee shal call to the heavens and to the earth, that hee may judg his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> 4. All who are in Covenant with God, every Member of the visible Church are Saints by calling; God alloweth this stile upon them, because they are dedicated and consecrated to him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are all by speciall vow obliged to be Saints; all make profession of their purpose to be such; all do esteem of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and wil have allowed unto them by others the esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Gods people, whatsoever be their deserving; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore saith he, <hi>Gather my Saints together unto me.</hi> 4 At how great a distance soever, whether of time or place, Gods people by profession have lived in this world, all of them shall be assembled to together at length to the judgment of that great day; some to the judgment of absolution, some to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of condemnation, good and bad, all shal be gathered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Judge at once; <hi>Gather my Saints together unto mee.</hi> 5. The Lord shal not want Officers, Serjeants, and Servants sufficient for this work, he hath Angels innumerable, who shal effect what he giveth order unto them for; <hi>Gather yee my Saints together.</hi> 6. The external Covenant with God, is the ground of the title and honour of Saintship, and church-member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; whosoever are in visible Covenant with God, are called by his allowance, <hi>his Saints</hi>; for so here he doth expound whom he calleth <hi>his Saints,</hi> even all those <hi>who have made a Covenant with him by sacrifice.</hi> 7. No Covenant can be made with God without the interposing of, or professed respect unto a sacrifice, according as the Lord did teach his people in the type and shadow of the ceremonial sacrificing; for as God by appointing a sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to be offered by his people would have every Covenanter to acknowledge and profess that he was worthy to die for his sins, and that it behoved him to flie to a suretie to die for him<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> (even
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:41635:173"/>
to the promised Messiah Jesus Christ, that Lamb of God which was slain from the beginning of the world, to take away the sinnes of the world;) and to consecrate himself wholly to Gods service; so doth the Lord require stil the same things of every Covenanter, from every one of his people; and whosoever do profess their accepting of the conditions of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, are called those that have made <hi>a Covenant with God by sacrifice.</hi> 8. In that general judgment, the wise framing the world, the constant course of governing of it, the appointing of the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of Summer &amp; Winter, Spring time and Harvest, the making of the Sun to shine, and the rain to fal upon all, and the furnishing of all with food and good things, shal be witnesses for Gods part to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward all men, and so <hi>the heavens shal declare his righteousness.</hi> 9. No man shal be injured nor suffer wrongfully that day; yea, all men shal have wrongs done to them repaired, all rewards shal be given according as the word of the Lord hath said: <hi>For God is judg himself.

               <p>Having now foretold his people, that there shal be certainly a great day of judging of all men, and specially of his Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed people; he entereth here in a friendly manner of controversie with his visible Church or professed people, that they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and find mercy in time, before they were brought to a tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of severe justice: And first, he useth a preface directing his speech to such as were of a better outward behaviour then the worst, to wit, such as trusted in their own works, and specially in the external sacrifices and ceremonies of the Law without looking to the end and intent thereof; as if by those external sacrifices their sins had been expiated, and God fully satisfied for them. <hi>Whence learne,</hi> 1. A people setled upon the dregs of their carnal customes, in security and presumption, cannot be moved to enter into conside<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Albeit the Lord doth suffer such as are without the Church, strangers to the Covenant and Common-wealth of <hi>Israel,</hi> to lie stil in their sinnes; yet
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:41635:173"/>
will he debate his quarrel against his own people, which is no small mercy; <hi>O Israel! I will testifie against thee.</hi> 3. The Covenant made with God, joyned with his absolute Sovereignty, do lay double bonds upon Gods people for the obedience of faith, obliging them not to seek salvation otherways then he doth teach us; but to worship and serve him as he appointeth; for, <hi>I am God, even thy God,</hi> saith the Lord. 4. Whatsoever quarrel the Lord has against his people for not keeping Covenant made with him; yet so long as there is hope of repentance, he will not dissolve the Covenant, but will offer the benefit thereof unto them; for when the Lord hath said, <hi>I will testifie against thee,</hi> he addeth, <hi>I am God, even thy God,</hi> ver. 11.</p>

               <p>After the preface, the Lord passeth by the reproof for much neglect, even in the external performances of outward ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and chall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Albeit there be just reason to challenge men for coming short of their duty in the discharge of outward ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; yet when that is not the main fault, or when the mending of that fault will not satisfie God, he will wave that challenge for the present, and fasten upon their chief sins, <hi>I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices, or thy burnt-offerings which should have been continually before me.</hi> 2. As men are ordinarily little sensible of their omissions of duties, so are they ready to overvalue their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:41635:174"/>
performances, and to think that what they do in this kind shall be very acceptable to God, as the carnal Israelites here chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged, did conceive their bullocks <hi>and goats out of their houses or folds</hi> should have been esteemed by God of as much worth, as they who offered them did put upon them. 3. That which is most esteemed of by men, without allowance of God, is abomination to God: such were the external sacrifices of carnal Israelities, who rested upon the offering of external sacrifices, without looking to that only true sacrifice of the Mediator repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented thereby: <hi>I will take no bullock out of thy house, nor he-goat out of thy fold.</hi> 4. It is a disease of foolish man, to think with himself that God is obliged to him when he offereth unto God any part of his goods, when in the mean time a man hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what God hath given unto him, and which is the Lords by primitive right; <hi>Every beast of the forrest is mine, and the cattel upon a thousand hills.</hi> 5. Albeit all men profess that they acknowledge God to be owner of all the creatures, because he hath made them all; yet their practice many ways doth bewray their heart-ignorance in this point, and that they have need to be taught this lesson from God, <hi>I know all the fowls of the mountains, and the wild beasts of the field are mine.</hi> 6. Unrenewed men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chuse but have gross co nceptions of God, and to think of him after their own fancy, as the carnal Israelites conceived that a fat sacrifice was as acceptable to God, as a fat dinner was to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; but God is not like man, and standeth in no need of supply from man or from any of the creatures; all of them have their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and dependance on God, to dispose of them, and bestow them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Lord disdaineth the fleshly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits which men have to satisfie his justice for their sins by any thing that man can offer unto him, as imaginations unbeseeming a reasonable man; <hi>Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?</hi>

<pb n="327" facs="tcp:41635:174" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of seeking salvation, and setteth them upon the right course of true blessedness and spiritual service. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The way of salvation and of Gods worship is spiritual, and may possibly be resembled and furthered by external bodily exercises, but does not stand on things external; and to speak it more particularly, God will have the man whose person and service he will accept, to be sensible of his own want of every good thing, and inability to furnish to himself any thing which he lacketh, and to acknowledge God only to be the all-sufficient fountain of grace and of every good donation, and to seek what he hath need of from God, and to depend upon his grace when he hath sought it, and to return the praise of Gods free and gracious gift unto him when he hath received it; for all this is presupposed &amp; imported in this offering of thanks, <hi>Offer unto God thanksgiving</hi>; to wit, for every point and passage of his undeserved favour: and this he calleth for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this offering of the sacrifice of praise and thanks, was more acceptable to God then their Ceremonial sacrifices of slain beasts. 2. God will have the man, whose person and service he will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, to make conscience of all his lawful vowes made unto God, in special of his Covenant-vow made for giving God the obedience of faith all the days of his life, which vow true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers use upon sundry occasions solemnly to renew: <hi>Offer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God thanksgiving, and pay thy vows unto the most high God.</hi> 3. Were a man never so faithful and upright in the Lords service, yet he is not exempted from trouble, for reasons concerning Gods glory, good of the person troubled, and benefit of others; this the Lord holdeth forth in preparing their mindes, by making mention unto believers <hi>of a day of trouble.</hi> 4. Among other ends of the Lords sending trouble, this is one, to make the believer in the sense of his need to make use of his Covenant with God, and by faith to draw neer to him in prayer for help and relief in due time, <hi>Call upon me in the day of thy trouble.</hi> 5. The true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever and depender upon the sure and rich grace of God, cannot possibly fall in any trouble out of which he shall not be delivered, but whatsoever evil come, he may (by praying to God) yea he shal be delivered, <hi>Call upon me in the day of trouble, I will deliver thee.</hi> What more absolute promise can be made to a believing suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant? 6. A believing supplicant shall not only be graciously an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered to his petition, and so have cause of praising God; but also shall have grace in effect to praise God, <hi>And thou shalt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie me.</hi>

               <p>In the fourth place, the Lord pleadeth mercifully with the gross sinner and scandulous liver, for abusing this priviledge of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant by his lewd conversation and secure Atheisme, that he being convinced of his sin, might repent, and eschew the wrath which is to come. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. To such as profess Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and observe the outward ordinances thereof, and do not live scandalously; the Lord howsoever he lets them know he is not well pleased with their way, yet he doth speak unto them more mildly, because it is possible some beloved Laodiceans, young and unskilful true converts may be guilty of no small measure of dead formality; but to such as live in gross scandalous sins, the Lord speaketh more roughly, calling them by the name of <hi>wicked; But unto the wicked God saith.</hi> 2. Such is the deceivableness of sin, and the deceit of the heart, and the power of Satan upon se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure sinners, that they can without remorse of conscience pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess the true Religion, pretend to a Covenant with God, and yet live loosly as Pagans or Atheists: <hi>They take Gods Covenant in their mouth,</hi> and mean time <hi>do hate instruction, and cast Gods words behind them.</hi> 3. Such as by their lewd conversation do give an open affront to their Religion, are so detestable to God, that he accompteth them wicked haters of reformation, contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Scripture, disgracers of their holy profession, and such as
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:41635:175"/>
he wil take no Religious service of their hand: <hi>Unto the wicked God saith, what hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or that thou shouldst take my Covenant in thy mouth, seeing thou hatest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, and castest my words behinde thee?</hi> 4. Albeit men do profane the Covenant, and deserve to be thrust out of it as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to have the benefit of it, or to be suffered any more to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess it; yet God wil not give up with them hastily, but wil af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a friendly manner declare to them their sin and misdeserving, that their conscience may be moved towards repentance; <hi>What hast thou to do to take my Covenant in thy mouth, seeing thou hatest instruction?</hi> 5. The man that casteth Gods word behind him, cannot chuse but serve a worse master, and be made slave to his lusts, and be led away to every sin, as tentation doth lead him; he wil not stand to be a greedy thief, and a filthy adulterer, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. and to loose his tongue to all the evils whereunto the tongue can serve, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. yea and to become unnatural to those with whom he is bound in nearest bonds of blood, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. 6. Such is the Lords patience, that he doth oft-times endure very long horrible provocations of those that are in outward Covenant with him, in that by his long-suffering he may lead them to repentance: <hi>These things thou didst, and I kept silence.</hi> 7. When men do not profit by the means which should lead them to repentance, they grow worse for the means, more secure and hardened in their ill wayes, and more godless in all respects: <hi>Thou thoughtest I was altogether such a one as thy self.</hi> 8. Such as live a loose life with a professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Religion under the shining light of Gods word, do not keep their consciences quiet, otherwaies then by transforming God into an idol after their own fancy, and by feigning him to be what he is not, and not to be what he declareth himself to be; <hi>Thou thoughtest that I was altogether such a one as thy self</hi>; that is to say, <hi>No more displeased with thy wayes then thou thy selfe was.</hi> 9. Although the Lord keep silence for a time, yet he wil at length let the sinner know by his word and rods, how displeased he is at sin: <hi>But I wil reprove thee,</hi> saith the Lord. 10. Sins forgotten cast behind back, and cast together in confusion by the secure sinner, shal in the day of Gods reckoning be brought to remembrance with time, place, and other circumstances, and so presented to the conscience, as the sinner shal not be able to look aside from his fearful accusation and ditty, <hi>I will set them in order before thine eyes.</hi>

               <p>In the last place, the Lord being lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> to him, as he doth also encourage such as are sincere worshippers of him to go on. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The Lords controversie with his people, and threatning of wrath upon them, do carry much love and mercy in their bosome; it is admirable that such offers of grace and reconciliation are made by God after so just and fearful challenges, as here we read. 2. As the affectionate remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of God is an aw-band to keep from sin, and a spur to all duties; and as consideration of Gods word is a means to waken the conscience, and affect the heart with high and right thoughts of God: so the forgetting of God, and consideration of what is necessary, casts a man open to all sin, and makes way for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction; <hi>Consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear you in pieces.</hi> 3. If they who have gone far away from God, do not haste them home unto him, they are like to meet with judgement mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciless, and to finde no opportunity or time granted as they could wish to repent, <hi>Consider, lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver you.</hi> 4 To set men on work to endeavour the honour of God by worshipping him in spirit, and to conforme their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward actions of the body to the rule of Gods word, is the scope of all Gods pleading with his own people; for his controversie is clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with a direction to all, <hi>to glorifie God, and to order their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation aright.</hi> 5. That man worshippeth God in spirit, who giveth him the praise of his <hi>justice,</hi> in acknowledging his sinnes against Gods law, and his ill deservings <hi>in the course</hi> of daily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed repentance, and who giveth unto God the praise of his <hi>grace</hi> and mercy, in flying to the refuge set before him in the Gospel, in the course of daily renewed <hi>acts of faith</hi> in Christ<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and he who giveth God the praise of his holiness in studying daily to mortifie the lusts of the flesh by his Spirit, and to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in his minde and affections; and in a word, he who in his heart and affections studieth to give God the honour <hi>of all his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes,</hi>
                  <pb n="331" facs="tcp:41635:176"/>
titles, or name, by whatsoever occasion manifested to him: This is the worshipper of God in spirit and truth, whom the Lord by all his dealing with his people is seeking to form and gain to himself, <hi>Who so offereth praise, glorifieth me.</hi> 6. Sincere endeavour to worship God in spirit, is best seen in a mans care to conform his life and bodily actions to the rule of Gods word; for with <hi>glorifying of God</hi> he joyneth here, <hi>ordering his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation aright.</hi> 7. Whosoever shall set himself to be Gods servant in spirit and truth, shall finde God to be his Saviour to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost, how godless soever, how vile soever he hath been; If he shall prepare himself against the dreadfull day of Judgement, by receiving the offer of grace in Jesus Christ, with all the fulness of the salvation of God in him, and in Christs strength shall study to bring forth the fruits of his faith in a blameless conversation, he shall undoubtedly be saved: for God hath said, <hi>Whoso offereth the sacrifice of praise, glorifies me, and to him who ordereth his conversation aright, will I shew the salvation of God.</hi> Amen, Amen.</p>
