         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:11846:3"/>
of ſuch as can beſt judge of this matter, of all the Bookes which are written, that treate of Spirit &amp; Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Perfection, the holy Scripture excepted, it is inferiour to none, if it excelleth not all.</p>
            <p>No book hath bin more approued by generall conſent, none more often printed &amp; tranſlated into diuers lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, none more eſteemed, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, yea commanded alſo by the chiefe Maſters of Spirit of ſome reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Orders, to be often read by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one in priuate, and once a week publikely to al. So full of ſweet ſenſe is this diuine Flower, that the moſt ſpirituall Bees may daily draw from thence great plentie of celeſtiall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. It is a diſh of ſo diuine meat, that it neuer ſatiates the deuout mind: but as the Wiſdome of God doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to all ſuch as ſit at that heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly banquent; ſo ſhal they find in this ſpiritual food, <hi>The more they eat it, the more
<pb facs="tcp:11846:3"/>
they ſhall hunger after it.</hi> Eccleſ. 4.</p>
            <p>And the reaſon hereof is, for that it containeth ſo great depth of ſpirit, and ſo great ſtore and variety of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly documents, that it ſeemeth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer new to the Reader, and like ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Manna, affordeth to euery one that delightfull taſte which beſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth with the palate of his ſoule: and none can loath it, but they whoſe luſtes doe carry them to Aegyptian ſlauery. A true Iſraelite may feed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it forty yeares together, and euer finde ſuch pleaſing taſte and encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſtrength by vſe therof, as wil ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine him in the deſert of this world, and enable him to goe on without fainting, till he arriue at his promiſed inheritance of eternall reſt.</p>
            <p>The practiſe of that which this booke doth teach, couereth the ſoule with the rich garment of grace, and adorneth it with the ſplendent pearls of Euangelical perfection, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth

It rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth vp to cheerefull confidence the debaſed head, &amp; placeth in a Throne of endleſſe honour thoſe who in this world doe ſeeme impriſoned in the blacke cloud of diſgrace.</p>
            <p>To you therefore who haue ſo willingly endured the loſſe of your earthly ſubſtance, I haue thought good to preſent this Euangelicall Pearle, and incomparable Treaſure contained in a little roome.

               <p n="2">2 Giue not thy ſelfe to inordinat deſire of knowledge: for therein is much diſtraction and deceit.

Rom. 12. Why wilt thou preferre thy ſelfe before others, ſith there bee many more learned and skilfull in the Law then thou?

               <p>HAppy is he, whom Truth by it ſelfe doth teach, not by figures, and voices that paſſe away; but as it is in it ſelfe. Pſal. 93.1. Our owne opinion and ſenſe doe often deceiue vs, and it diſcernes little. What auai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it to diſpute and contend about
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:11846:13"/>
darke and hidden things; whereas for being ignorant of them, we ſhall not ſo much as once be reprehended at the day of Iudgment? Eccl. 3. It is a great folly to neglect the things that are profitable and neceſſary, and giue our mindes to that which is cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and hurtfull: we haue eies and doe not ſee. Pſal. 113.</p>
               <p n="2">2 And what haue we to doe with the termes and diſtinctions of Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians? Hee to vvhom the eternall Word ſpeaketh, is deliuered from multitudes and diuerſities of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. By that one Word all things doe ſpeake, and all declare the ſame: and this is the beginning, and that which ſpeaketh vnto vs. No man without that Word vnderſtandeth or judgeth rightly. Hee to vvhom all things are one, vvho draweth all things to one, and ſeeth all things in one, may enjoy a quiet minde, and remaine peaceable in God. O God,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:11846:13"/>
the eternal Truth, make me one with thee in euerlaſting charity. It is te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to me often to reade and heare many things. In thee is all that I vvould haue, and can deſire. Let all Doctors hold their peace: let all creatures be ſilent in thy ſight: ſpeak thou alone vnto me.</p>
               <p n="3">3 How much the more one is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired vvithin himſelfe, and becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth inwardly ſincere and pure; ſo much the more, and higher myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries doth he vnderſtand vvithout la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: for that he receiueth light of vnderſtanding from aboue. Mat. 11. Luk. 10. A pure, ſincere and ſtayed ſpirit is not diſtracted, though hee be imployed in many vvorkes: for that hee worketh all to the honor of God, and laboureth for invvard tranquillitie, without ſeeking him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in any thing he doth. Who hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and troubles thee more then the vnmortified deſires of thine owne

A good and deuout man firſt of all diſpoſeth in himſelfe his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvard vvorks: neither do they draw him to the deſires of an inordinate inclination; but he ordereth them to the preſcript of reaſon. Who hath a greater combate, then he that labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to ouercome himſelfe? This ought to be our endeauour, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer our ſelues daily, to vvaxe ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and be more able to ſubdue our paſſions, and alwayes in this way to get ſome ground.</p>
               <p n="4">4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> All perfection in this life hath ſome imperfections mixt with it: and no knowledge of ours is voide of darknes and ignorance. An humble knowledge of thy ſelfe is a more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure way to God, then a deep ſearch after learning: yet learning is not to be blamed, nor the only knowledge of any thing whatſoeuer is to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked, it being good in it ſelfe, and ordained by God: but a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:11846:14"/>
and a vertuous life is to be preferred before it. And for that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny endeauour, rather to get know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, then to liue well: therefore they are often deceiued, and reape either none, or very ſlender profit of their labours.</p>
               <p n="5">5 O, if men beſtowed as much labour in the rooting out of vices, and planting of vertues, as they do in mouing doubts and queſtions; ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would there ſo much hurt bee done, nor ſo great ſcandall be giuen in the world, nor ſo much looſnes be practiſed in places erected for ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue!

Bleſſed are the ſimple and pure minds: for they ſhal enioy much peace.</p>
               <p n="2">2 What is the reaſon why ſome of the Saints were ſo perfect, and contemplatiue; Becauſe they labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to mortifie themſelues wholly to earthly deſires; and therefore they could with their whole heart, giue themſelues to God, and freely attend to their owne affaires.

The greateſt, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the whole impediment is, for that wee are not free from our paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and diſordered inclinations: neither doe wee endeauour to enter into that path of perfection, which the Saints haue walked before vs: and when any ſmall aduerſitie befal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs, we are too quickly deiected, and turne our ſelues to humane com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts.</p>

For he who giueth vs occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to fight, to the end we may get the victory, is ready to ſuccour thoſe that fight manfully, and doe truſt in his grace.

               <p>SO long as wee liue in this world we cannot be without tribulation and temptation: for as it is written in Iob: Temptation is the life of man vpon earth. Euery one therefore ought to be carefull, and diligently

No man is ſo perfect and holy, but hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times temptations: and we cannot be altogether free from them.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Temptations are often profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto men; though they be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome and grieuous: for in them man is humbled, purged and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. All the Saints haue paſſed and profited through many tribulations and temptations; and they that could not beare temptations, became re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate and fell from God. There is no order ſo holy, nor place ſo ſecret, where there be not temptations or aduerſities.</p>
               <p n="3">3 There is no man that is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther free from temptations, whileſt he liueth on earth: for in our ſelues is the cauſe thereof, being borne
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:11846:25"/>
with inclination to euill. When one temptation or tribulation goeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, another commeth: and we ſhal euer haue ſomething to ſuffer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe wee haue loſt that innocencie with which we were created. Many ſeeke to flie temptations, and do fall more grieuouſly into them. By flight alone we cannot ouercome; but by patience and true humility, wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſtronger then all our enemies.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Hee that onely auoideth them outwardly, and doth not pluck them vp by the root, ſhall profit little: yea temptation will the ſooner returne vnto him; and he ſhall feele himſelfe in worſe caſe then before. By little and little, and by patience with lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganimitie (through Gods help) thou ſhalt more eaſily ouercome, then with violence, and thine owne im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity. Often take counſell in temptation, and deale not, roughly with him that is tempted; but giue

               <p n="5">5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The beginning of al euil temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, is inconſtancie of minde, and little confidence in God: for as a ſhippe without a ſterne is toſted to and fro with the waues: ſo the man that is negligent, and leaueth his purpoſe, is many wayes tempted. Fire trieth iron, and temptation a juſt man. We know not oftentimes what we are able to doe, but temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations doe ſhew vs what wee are. We muſt be watchfull, eſpecially in the beginning of the temptation, for the enemie is then more eaſily ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, if hee bee not ſuffered to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the dore of our hearts, but bee reſiſted without the gate at his firſt knocke. Wherefore, one ſaid: Ouid. libr. 1. de remed. amoris. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the beginnings, for an after-remedie comes often too late. Firſt there commeth to the minde an euill

thought, then a ſtrong imagination thereof, afterwards delight, and an euill motion, and then conſent: and ſo by little and little our wicked e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie getteth full entrance, whileſt he is not reſiſted in the beginning. And how much the longer one is negligent in reſiſting; ſo much wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker doth he become daily, and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy ſtronger againſt him.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Some ſuffer greateſt temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the beginning of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion; others in the later end; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers againe are much troubled al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt through the whole time of their life.

               <p n="7">7 We ought not therefore to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire when we are tempted; but ſo

Let vs therefore humble our ſelues vnder the hand of God in all temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and tribulation; for he wil ſaue and exalt the humble in ſpirit.</p>
               <p n="8">8 In temptations and afflictions man is proued, how much he hath profited; and his merit is thereby the greater before God, and his vertues doe more openly appeare.

               <p>FOr no worldly thing, nor for the loue of any man, is any euill to be done: Matth. 18. but yet for the profit of one that ſtandeth in need, a good worke is ſometimes to be left off, or changed alſo for a better. For by doing this, a good worke is not loſt, but changed into another of greater merit. The exteriour worke without charity profiteth nothing; 1. Cor. 13. but whatſoeuer is done of charitie, be it neuer ſo little and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible in the ſight of the world, it is fruitfull, and of great eſteeme in the ſight of God. For God weigheth more with how much loue one wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, then how much he doth. Hee doth much, that loueth much. Luk. 7.</p>
               <p n="2">2 He doth much, that doth a thing well: he doth well, that rather ſerueth the common good of others, then his
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:11846:28"/>
owne will. Phil. 2. Oftentimes it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to bee charity, and it is rather carnality: becauſe naturall inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſelfe-will, hope of reward, and deſire of our owne commodity will ſeldome be wanting.</p>
               <p n="3">3 He that hath true and perfect charity, ſeeketh himſelfe in nothing; but onely deſireth in all things that the glory of God ſhould be exalted. Phil. 2.3. &amp; 1. Cor. 13.

               <p>THoſe things that a man cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend in himſelfe or in others, he ought to ſuffer patiently, vntill God ordaine otherwiſe. Thinke that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it is better ſo, for thy triall and patience, without which our merits are not much to be eſteemed. Thou oughteſt to pray, notwithſtanding, when thou haſt ſuch impediments, that God would vouchſafe to helpe thee, and that thou mayeſt beare them patiently. Matth. 6. Luk. 11.</p>
               <p n="2">2 If one that is once or twice warned doth not amend, contend not with him; but commit all to God, that his will may be fulfilled, and his name honored in all his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, vvho knovveth hovv to turne euill into good.

that thy ſelfe alſo haſt many things, which muſt bee ſuffered by others. Theſſ. 5. &amp; Ioh. 1. Luk. 6. If thou canſt not make thy ſelfe ſuch an one as thou wouldeſt; how canſt thou ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to haue another in all things to thy liking? Wee vvould vvillingly haue others perfect, and yet vvee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend not our owne faults.</p>
               <p n="3">3 We vvill haue others ſeuerely corrected, and vvill not be corrected our ſelues. The large libertie of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers diſpleaſeth vs: and yet we will not haue our deſires denied vs. Wee will haue others kept vnder by rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous lawes; but in no ſort wil we our ſelues be reſtrained.

               <p>THe life of a religious perſon ought to ſhine with all vertues; that he may inwardly be ſuch, as outwardly he ſeemeth to men. Mat. 5. And with reaſon thou oughteſt to bee much more within, then is perceiued with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out: for God beholdeth the heart, Pſal. 33. Heb. 4.

whereſoeuer wee are, and walke in purity like Angels in his ſight; and to renue daily our purpoſes, and ſtir vp our ſelues to feruour, as though this were the firſt day of our conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and to ſay: Helpe me, my God, in this my good purpoſe, and in thy holy ſeruice; and grant that I may now this day begin perfectly: for that which I haue done hitherto, is nothing.</p>
               <p n="2">2 According to our purpoſe, ſhall be the ſucceſſe of our profit, and much diligence is neceſſary to him that will profit much. And if he that firmely purpoſeth, often faileth; what ſhall he doe, that ſeldome pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth any thing, or with little cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty? It may fall out ſundry waies that we leaue off our purpoſe: and if for light occaſions wee omit our accuſtomed exerciſes, it ſeldome paſſeth without ſome loſſe. The pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of juſt men is rather grounded
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:11846:34"/>
vpon the grace of God, then on their owne wiſdome, in whom alſo they alwayes haue confidence, in whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they take in hand. For man doth purpoſe, but God diſpoſeth: neither is the way of man in his own hands. Prou. 16.</p>
               <p n="3">3 If an accuſtomed exerciſe bee ſometimes omitted for ſome worke of charitie, or of intention to profit our neighbour, it may eaſily after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward be recouered: Eccleſ. 7. but if it be lightly left through inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie or negligence, it is an offence, and will proue hurtfull. Though vve endeauour what we can, yet ſhall we faile in many things. But yet me muſt alwaies purpoſe ſomething certaine, eſpecially againſt that which moſt hinders vs. We muſt examine well, and order both our exteriour and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour actions; for that both are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for our progreſſe in vertue.</p>
               <p n="4">4 If thou canſt not alwaies recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect

In the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning make thy good purpoſe; Deu. 4. in the euening examine thy ſelf what thou haſt bin that day in word, deed or thought: for that in theſe often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times perhaps thou haſt offended God and thy neighbour.

Neuer be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther idle, but either reading, or wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or praying, or meditating, or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring ſomething of profit for the common good: but bodily exerciſes are to be diſcreetly vſed, and not to be vndertaken equally of all.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Thoſe things that be not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, are not to be done in the ſight of al: for priuate things are beſt done in ſecret. But thou muſt beware, thou

All cannot vſe the ſame exerciſe, but one is more conuenient for this perſon, another for that. According to the diuerſity of times alſo, diuers exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are fitting: for ſome ſuite better with feſtiuall daies, others with daies of labour. We haue need of one kind in temptations, and of others in time of peace and quiet. Wee deſire to thinke of other things when we are ſorrowfull, then we do when we are cheerefull in our Lord.</p>
               <p n="6">6 When principall feaſts draw neere, good exerciſes are to be renu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and the interceſſions of Saints more feruently to be implored. From

feaſt to feaſt, we ſhould make ſome good purpoſe, as though wee were then to depart out of this world, and to come to the euerlaſting feaſts of heauen. And therefore we ought to prepare our ſelues carefully at holy times, and to liue more deuoutly, and to keepe more exactly all things that wee are to obſerue, as though ſhortly we were to receiue reward of our labour at Gods hands.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXI. Of Compunction of heart.</head>
               <p>IF thou wilt profit any thing, keepe thy ſelfe alwayes in the feare of God, and yeeld not too much ſcope to liberty. Prou. 19. Containe all thy ſenſes vnder the rule of diſcipline, and giue not thy ſelfe to fooliſh mirth. Giue thy ſelfe to compuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of heart, and thou ſhalt finde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion. Compunction diſcouereth much good, which with too much li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty is quickly loſt. It is meruaile that a man can euer perfectly reioice
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:11846:39"/>
in this life, if he conſider his baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and weigh the many perills, wherwith his ſoule is inuironed. The leuity of our minds, &amp; the little care we haue of our faults, makes vs not to feele the ſorrowes of our ſoule.</p>
               <p n="2">2 But oftentimes we vainly laugh, when wee haue juſt cauſe to weepe. There is neither true libertie, nor good mirth, but that which is in the feare of God, accompanied with a good conſcience. Happy is he, that can auoid all cauſe of diſtraction, and draw himſelfe to the vnion of holy compunction. Happy is he, that can abandon all that may defile, or bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den his conſcience. Fight manfully: one cuſtome ouercomes another. If thou canſt forbeare to intermeddle with that which belongs to others; they will not hinder thee in that which thou haſt to doe.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Buſie not thy ſelfe in matters which appertaine to others: neither

doe thou meddle at all with the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of thy betters. Looke firſt of al to thy ſelfe, and haue a more eſpecial care to admoniſh thy ſelf, then who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer thou loueſt beſt. If thou haſt not the fauour of men, be not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore grieued; Gal. 1. but let this ſeeme vnto thee a moſt juſt cauſe of griefe, that thou lookeſt not to thy ſelf with that care, which beſeemeth the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant of God, and a deuout religious perſon. It is oftentimes better and more ſecure, that a man hath not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny conſolations in this life, eſpecially ſuch, as are agreeable to the inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our corrupt nature. But that we haue none at all, or doe ſeldome taſte diuine comforts, the fault is ours, that doe not ſeeke for compun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of heart, nor do wholly forſake the vaine comforts of this world.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Acknowledge thy ſelfe vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of diuine comforts, &amp; that thou haſt deſerued great tribulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a

man hath perfect contrition, then is the whole world grieuous and loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome vnto him. Iudg. 2. &amp; 20. A good man findeth alwaies ſufficient cauſe of teares and ſorrow; for whether he conſider himſelf, or weigh the eſtate of his neighbour, hee knoweth that none liueth here without tribulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 2. King. 13. And how much the more throughly he conſidereth himſelfe; ſo much the more is his ſorrow. Our ſinnes and vices in which wee are ſo plunged, that we can ſeldome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template the things of heauen, doe miniſter vnto vs matter of moſt juſt ſorrow and hartie contrition.</p>
               <p n="5">5 If thou didſt thinke more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently of thy death, then of liuing long, thou wouldeſt without doubt be more careful in the amendment of thy life. Eccleſ. 7. And if thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt conſider within thy ſelfe, the paines of hell, or of Purgatory. Mat. 25. I am perſwaded it would moue

               <p n="6">6 Oftentimes our want of ſpirit is the cauſe, that our wretched bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies do ſo quickly complaine.

               <p>THe houre of death will quickly ouertake thee, and therefore looke how thou liueſt. To day a man is liuing, and to morrow he doth not appeare; and being once out of ſight, he is alſo quickly out of minde. Iob. 9. &amp; 14. Luk. 12. O dulnes and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of mans heart, who thinketh on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on that he ſeeth, and foreſeeth not that which is to come! Hebr. 9. Thou ſhouldeſt alwayes ſo order thy thoughts and actions, as if this very

day thou wert to depart this life. If thou hadſt a good conſcience, thou wouldeſt not much feare death. Luk. 12. It is better to auoid ſin, then to flie death. Sap. 4. If thou be not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to day; how wilt thou be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to morrow? Mat. 24. &amp; 25. To morrow-day is vncertaine, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou ſhalt ſee it or no, thou knoweſt not.</p>
               <p n="2">2 What doth it auaile vs to liue long, when we do ſo little amend? A long life doth not alwaies make vs better, nay rather it oftentimes hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth vpon vs a greater load of ſins, O that wee had ſpent one day well in this world! Many doe reckon the yeares of their conuerſion, but full ſlender oftentimes is the fruit of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment. If it be a dreadfull thing to die, perhaps it will be more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous for thee to liue long.

himſelfe daily therunto. Eccl. 7. If thou haſt at any time ſeen a man die, thinke with thy ſelfe, that thou muſt one day paſſe the ſame way.</p>
               <p n="3">3 When it ts morning, think that perhaps thou ſhalt not liue vntill night; and when euening comes, do not dare to promiſe vnto thy ſelfe the next morning. Heb. 9. Be alwaies ready, &amp; ſo order thy ſelfe, that death may neuer take thee vnprepared. Many die ſuddenly: for the Sonne of Man will come, when we leaſt think of it. Luk. 21. When that laſt houre ſhal come, thou wilt begin to thinke far otherwiſe of thy life, and much lament that thou haſt beene ſo ſlack and negligent. Matth. 24. Luk. 12.</p>
               <p n="4">4 O, how wiſe and happy is hee, that now laboureth to be ſuch in his life, as he wiſheth to be found at the houre of his death! For the perfect contempt of the world, the feruent deſire to profit in vertue, the loue of

diſcipline, the labour of penance, the readines of obedience, the forſaking of our ſelues, and the bearing pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently of all aduerſitie for the loue of Chriſt, will giue great confidence of a happy end. Thou mayeſt doe much good whileſt thou art wel; but when thou art ſick, what thou wilt be able to doe, I know not.

But alas, that thou ſpendeſt it ſo little to thy profit, in which thou mighteſt gaine eternall life! The time will come, when thou wilt deſire one day or one houre to amend, and I cannot aſſure thee that thou ſhalt obtaine it.</p>
               <p n="6">6 O my deareſt brother, from how great danger mayeſt thou deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thy ſelfe! From how great feare maeyſt thou bee freed, if thou doeſt now liue fearefull, and carefull of thy death! Labour to liue in ſuch ſort, that at the houre of death thou maiſt rather reioyce then feare. Learne now to die to the world, that thou maiſt then begin to liue with Chriſt. Learne now to contemne all earthly things, that thou mayeſt then freely go to Chriſt.

And he that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth God with his whole heart, nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to feare neither death, puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, judgement, nor hell: for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect loue giues ſecure acceſſe to God.

Rom. 8. But hee that delighteth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in ſinne, what wonder though he alwaies feare death, and be terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the thought of judgement. Yet it is good, that if loue be not of force to withhold thee from ſinne, that at leaſt the feare of hell may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine thee. And he that layeth aſide the feare of God, can neuer continue long in good ſtate, but falleth quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the ſnares of the diuell.</p>

               <p>BE watchfull and diligent in the ſeruice of God, and often thinke with thy ſelfe wherfore thou cameſt, and why thou didſt leaue the world. 2. Tim. 4. Was it not that thou migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt liue to God, and become a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall man? Goe on therefore with courage: thou ſhalt ſhortly receiue the reward of thy labours, and there ſhall be no more feare nor ſorrow in
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:11846:51"/>
the confines of thy habitation. Mat. 5. Apoc. 21. Thou muſt labour heere a while: thou ſhalt afterwards haue great reſt; yea euerlaſting ioy. Eccleſ. 51. If thou continueſt faithfull and diligent in ſeruing of God, doe not doubt but God will be faithfull and liberall in giuing thee reward. Apoc. 21. &amp; 22. Matth. 25. Thou oughteſt to haue a good hope of getting the victory, but thou muſt not make thy ſelfe aſſured thereof, leſt thou waxe negligent, or bee puffed vp with pride. Rom. 5.</p>
               <p n="2">2 When one that was in great anxiety of mind, often wauering be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene feare and hope, did once, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oppreſſed with griefe, proſtrate himſelfe in a Church in praier before an Altar, and ſaid within himſelfe: O, if I knew that I ſhould yet perſeuer! He preſently heard, as it were, a voice from God, which ſaid: What if thou diddeſt know it, what wouldeſt thou
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:11846:51"/>
doe? Doe now what thou wouldeſt doe then, and thou ſhalt bee ſecure. And being herewith comforted, and ſtrengthened in minde, he commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelfe wholly to the will of God, &amp; that noyſom anxiety ceaſed, neither had hee any minde to ſearch curiouſly any further, to know what ſhould befall him; but rather labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to vnderſtand what was the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and acceptable will of God, for the beginning and accompliſhing of euery good worke, Rom. 12.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Hope in our Lord, and doe good, ſaith the Prophet, and inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit the land, and thou ſhalt be fed in the riches thereof. Pſa. 36. One thing there is that draweth many backe from that ſpirituall good, &amp; the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent amendment of their liues: the horror of the difficulty, and the labor of the combat. But they aboue others profite moſt in vertue, that endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour moſt to ouercome thoſe things
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:11846:52"/>
which are grieuous, and contrary vnto them. For there a man profiteth more, and deſerueth greater grace, where hee more ouercommeth and mortifieth himſelfe in ſpirit.</p>
               <p n="4">4 But all men haue not alike to ouercome and mortifie: yet he that is zealous and diligent, though hee haue more paſſions, ſhall profit more in vertue, then another that is of a more temperate diſpoſition, if he be leſſe feruent in the purſuit of vertue. Two things chiefely helpe to our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment, to wit, to withdraw our ſelues violently from that to which nature is viciouſly inclined, and to labor earneſtly for that vertue, which we moſt want. Be carefull alſo to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide vvith great diligence, thoſe things in thy ſelfe, which doe moſt diſpleaſe thee in others.</p>

And if at any time thou haſt done it, labour quickely to amend it. As thine eye obſerueth others, ſo art thou alſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againe by others. O, how ſweet and comfortable a thing it is, to ſee the ſeruants of Chriſt feruent and deuout, endued with vertuous and decent manners! And on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, how pitifull and grieuous a thing it is, to ſee them that liue in a diſſolute and diſordered ſort, not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying themſelues to that, for which they were called!

Conſider the Carthuſians, Ciſtercians, and the Religious men and women of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers Orders, how they riſe euery night to ſing praiſes vnto God.

A paſſionate man turneth good into euill, and eaſily beleeueth the worſt. A good peaceable man turneth all things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to good.

               <p>WIth two wings man is lifted vp from earthly vanities, that is, with ſimplicity &amp; purity. Simplicity ought to be in our intention. Purity in our affection. Simplicity fixeth the eyes of the ſoule in God. Purity appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth and taſteth his ſweetnes. No good action will hinder thee, if thou be inwardly free from inordinate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. If thou intend and ſeeke no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the will of God, and the profite of thy neighbour, thou ſhalt enioy eternall libertie. If thy heart were ſincere and vpright, then euery creature would be vnto thee a looking-glaſſe of life, and a booke of holy doctrine. There is no creature
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:11846:61"/>
ſo little and abiect, that repreſenteth not the goodnes of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2 If in thine owne heart thou wert good and pure, then thou wouldeſt be able to ſee and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand all things without any impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment. Rom. 1. Prou. 3. A pure heart penetrateth heauen, and pierceth the depth of hell. Pſal. 118. Such as eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one is inwardly: ſo hee iudgeth outwardly. If there bee ioy in the world, ſurely a man of a pure heart poſſeſſeth it. And if there bee any where tribulation and affliction, an euill conſcience feeles it. As iron put into the fire leeſeth his ruſt, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth bright like fire: ſo he that wholly turning himſelfe vnto God, becommeth feruent, and is changed into a new man.</p>
               <p n="3">3 When one beginneth to wax cold: then he is afraid of a ſmall la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and willingly receaueth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall comfort. But when he once
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:11846:62"/>
beginneth to ouercome himſelfe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, and to walke manfully in the way of God: then hee eſteemeth thoſe things to be light, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeemed grieuous vnto him.</p>

We reprehend ſmall things in others, and paſſe ouer greater mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in our ſelues. We quickly feele, and vveigh vvhat vvee ſuffer at the hands of others; but wee minde not what others ſuffer from vs. Hee that

               <p n="2">2 A ſpirituall man preferreth the care of himſelf, before all other cares. Mat. 16. And he that diligently at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth vnto himſelfe, doth ſeldome ſpeak much of others. Thou wilt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be recollected &amp; deuout, vnleſſe thou paſſe ouer other mens matters with ſilence, and looke eſpecially to thy ſelfe. If thou attend wholly vnto God and thy ſelfe, thou wilt be little mooued with whatſoeuer thou ſeeſt abroad. 1. Cor. 4. Where art thou, when thou art not with thy ſelfe? Galat. 1. And when thou haſt runne ouer all, what haſt thou profited, if thou doeſt neglect thy ſelfe? If thou deſireſt peace of mind &amp; true vnion, thou muſt eſteeme little of all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, and look only to thy ſelfe.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Thou ſhalt therfore profit much, if thou keepe thy ſelfe free from all

temporall cares. Thou ſhalt hinder thy ſelfe greatly, if thou eſteeme any thing of this vvorld. Let nothing be great vnto thee, nothing high, nothing gratefull, nothing accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but only God himſelfe purely, or that which is for God. Eſteeme all comfort vaine which thou recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt from any creature. Eccleſ. 1. A ſoule that loueth God, deſpiſeth all things that be inferiour vnto God.

               <p>THe glory of a good man, is the teſtimony of a good conſcience. 2. Cor. 1. Haue a good conſcience, and thou ſhalt euer haue ioy. A good conſcience is able to beare much, and is cheerefull in aduerſities. An euill
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:11846:63"/>
conſcience is alwayes fearefull and vnquiet. Thou ſhalt reſt ſweetly, if thy heart doth not reprehend thee. Wiſd. 17. Do thou neuer reioyce, but when thou haſt done well. Sinners haue neuer true mirth, nor feele in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward peace: becauſe there is no peace to the impious, ſaith our Lord. And if they ſhould ſay: Wee are in peace, no euill ſhall fall vpon vs, and who ſhall dare to hurt vs? Luk. 12. Eſay. 27. Beleeue them not: for vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſudden will ariſe the wrath of God, and their deeds ſhall be turned into nothing, and their conceits ſhall periſh.</p>
               <p n="2">2 To glory in tribulation is no hard thing for him that loueth. Rom. 8. For to glory ſo, is to glory in the Croſſe of our Lord. That glory is ſhort, which is giuen and receiued from men. Galath. 6. Sorrow al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies accompanieth the glory of the world. The glory of the good is in
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:11846:64"/>
their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciences, &amp; not in the tongues of men. 2. Cor. 2. The gladnes of the juſt is of God, and in God: and their joy is of the truth. Hee that deſireth true &amp; euerlaſting glory, careth not for that which paſſeth away vvith time. And he that ſeeketh temporall glory, or contemneth it not from his heart, ſheweth himſelfe but little to eſteeme of the glory of heauen. He enioyeth great tranquillitie &amp; peace of minde, that careth neither for the praiſes, nor diſpraiſes of men.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Hee will eaſily be content and pacified, whoſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience is pure. He is not the more holy, though thou commend him: nor the more, abiect though thou diſpraiſe him. What thou art, that thou art: neither canſt thou be truly ſaid to be greater, then what thou art in the ſight of God. If thou conſider what thou art within thee, thou wilt not care what men ſay of thee. Man ſeeth in the face, but

God looketh into the heart. 1. King. 16. Man conſidereth the deeds, but God weigheth the intentions. To do alwayes well, and to eſteeme little of himſelfe, is a token of an humble minde. To refuſe to be comforted by any creature, is a ſigne of great purity, and inward confidence.</p>

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:11846:65"/>
Thou oughteſt to leaue thy beloued, for thy beloued; for that Ieſus will be beloued alone aboue all things. Deut. 6. The loue of things created is deceitfull and vnconſtant: the loue of Ieſus is faithfull and conſtant. Mat. 22. He that cleaueth vnto crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſhall fall with that which is ſubiect to fall. He that imbraceth Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus ſhall ſtand firmely for euer. Loue him, and keepe him for thy friend, who when all goe away, will not forſake thee, nor ſuffer thee to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in the end.

               <p n="2">2 Liue and die with Ieſus; and commit thy ſelfe vnto his truſt, who when all faile, can alone helpe thee. Thy beloued is of that nature, that he will none of that which appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to others: but vvill haue thy heart alone, and ſit like a King in his owne throne.

Truſt not, nor rely vpon a reedefull of vvinde: for that all fleſh is as hay, and all the glory ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſhall wither away as the flower of the field. Eſay 4.</p>

               <p>WHen Ieſus is preſent, all is well, and nothing ſeemeth difficult: but when Ieſus is abſent, euery thing is hard. When Ieſus ſpeaketh not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly vnto vs, our comfort is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth: but if Ieſus ſpeake but one word, we feele much conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Did not Mary Magdalen preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly riſe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the place where ſhe wept, when Martha ſaid vnto her: Thy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is here, and calleth thee. Ioh. 11. Happy is the houre whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ieſus calleth from teares to ſpiritual ioy. How dry and hard art thou without Ieſus? How fooliſh &amp; vaine, if thou deſire any thing out of Ieſus? Is not this a greater loſſe, then if thou ſhouldeſt loſe the whole world? Matth. 16.</p>
               <p n="2">2 What can the world profit thee without Ieſus? To be without Ieſus is a grieuous hell; and to be with Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:11846:66"/>
is a ſweet Paradiſe. If Ieſus be with thee, no enemy can hurt thee. Rom. 8. He that findeth Ieſus, findeth a good treaſure: yea a good aboue al goods. Mat. 13. And he that leeſeth Ieſus, leeſeth too much, &amp; more then the whole world. Hee is moſt poore that liueth without Ieſus: &amp; he moſt rich that is well with Ieſus. Luk. 12.</p>
               <p n="3">3 It is a great skill to know how to conuerſe with Ieſus, and a great wiſdome to know how to keepe Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. Prou. 8. Be humble &amp; peaceable, and Ieſus will be with thee. Be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout and quiet, and Ieſus will ſtay with thee. Thou mayeſt driue away Ieſus &amp; loſe his grace, if thou giueſt thy ſelfe to outward things. And if thou ſhouldeſt driue him from thee, and leeſe him, vnto whom wilt thou fly, and what friend wilt thou then ſeeke? Without a friend thou canſt not well liue: and if Ieſus be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue al a friend vnto thee; thou ſhalt

be too too ſorrowfull and deſolate. Thou doeſt therefore fooliſhly, if thou doeſt truſt or reioyce in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It is better for thee to haue all the vvorld againſt thee, then Ieſus offended with thee. Gal. 6. Amongſt al things therefore that be deare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, let Ieſus alone be thy chiefeſt beloued.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Loue all for Ieſus, but Ieſus for himſelfe, Ieſus Chriſt alone is eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to bee beloued; who alone is found to be good, and faithful aboue all friends. For him, and in him, let as well friends as foes be deare vnto thee: Mat. 5. and all theſe are to bee prayed for, that all may know &amp; loue him. Luk. 6. Neuer deſire to be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly commended or beloued, for that appertaineth onely vnto God, who hath none like vnto himſelfe. Neither do thou deſire that the hart of any ſhould be ſet on thee; nor do thou ſet thy heart on the loue of any:
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:11846:67"/>
but let Ieſus be in thee, and in euery vertuous and good man.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Bee pure and free within, and intangle not thy hart with any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Thou oughteſt to be, as it were, naked, and carry a pure heart to God, if thou wilt conſider; and proue, and ſee how ſweete our Lord is. And truely vnleſſe thou be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented, and drawne by his grace, thou ſhalt neuer attaine to that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines, to forſake and caſt away all, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

What great matter is it, if thou be cheerefull and deuout at the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of heauenly grace? This houre is wiſhed for of all men.

And what maruell if he feele not his burden, who is borne vp by the Almighty, and led by the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt guide?</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:11846:68"/>2 We are alwaies willing to haue ſomething for our comfort; and a man doth hardly put off, and forſake himſelfe. The holy Martyr S. Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence ouercame the world with his Prelate: becauſe he deſpiſed what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer ſeemed delightſome in the world: and for the loue of Chriſt he patiently ſuffered the high Prieſt of God, S. Syxtus, to be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from him, whom he moſt loued. He ouercame therfore the loue of man, by the loue of the Creator; and he rather choſe the diuine pleaſure, then humane co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. See thou alſo learne to forſake ſome neceſſary thing, and a beloued friend for the loue of God. Bee not grieued when thou art forſaken by a friend, knowing that we al at length muſt be ſeparated one from another.</p>
               <p n="3">3 A man muſt fight long, &amp; with a conſtant minde, before hee get the victory, &amp; be able to place his whole heart in God. When a man confideth
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:11846:69"/>
in himſelfe, he eaſily ſlideth vnto hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane comforts. But a true louer of Chriſt, &amp; a diligent follower of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, giueth not himſelfe to ſuch ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, nor ſeeketh ſenſible ſweetnes: but rather forcible exerciſes, and to ſuſtaine hard labours for Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4 When therefore ſpiritual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is giuen thee from God, receiue it thankfully: but know that it is the gift of God, not any deſert of thine. Be not puffed vp, ioy not too much, neither do thou preſume vainely: but be rather the more humble for that grace, and more wary and fearefull in all thy actions: for that houre wil paſſe away, and temptation will ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. When conſolation is taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thee, deſpaire not preſently; but with humility &amp; patience attend the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly viſitation: for God is able a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to giue thee greater conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This is not new nor ſtrange vnto them, that haue experience in the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:11846:69"/>
way of God: for in the great Saints and ancient Prophets, there was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes ſuch kinde of alteration.</p>
               <p n="5">5 For which cauſe, one when he had grace, ſaid: I ſaid in my plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, I will not be moued euerlaſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Pſalm. 29. But vvhen this vvas gone from him, hee addeth vvhat he found in himſelfe, ſaying: Thou turnedſt thy face from mee, and I became troubled. Ibid. Yet doth hee not deſpaire in the middeſt of theſe changes, but more earneſtly prayeth vnto our Lord, and ſaith: Vnto thee (O Lord) I will cry, and I will pray vnto my God. Ibid. Laſtly, he receiueth the fruite of his prayer, and witneſſeth that hee was heard, ſaying: Our Lord hath heard mee, and taken pitie on mee: our Lord is become my helper. Ibid. But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in? Thou haſt turned (ſaith he) my ſorrow into joy, and thou haſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed me about with gladnes. Ibid.
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:11846:70"/>
If great Saints haue beene ſo dealt withall, we that are poore and weake ought not to deſpaire, if we be ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times feruent, and ſometimes cold: for the ſpirit commeth and goeth, according to the good pleaſure of his will. Ioh. 3. For which cauſe bleſſed Iob ſaith, Thou viſiteſt him early in the morning, and ſuddenly thou proueſt him. Iob 7.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Whereupon therefore can I hope, or wherin ought I to truſt, but in the great mercy of God alone, and in the only hope of heauenly grace? For whether I enioy the preſence of good men, or deuout brethren, or faithfull friends, or holy bookes, or learned treatiſes, or ſweet ſongs and hymnes: all theſe helpe little, &amp; haue little ſauour, when grace forſaketh mee, and I remaine left in my owne pouerty. At ſuch a time there is no better remedy then patience, and the reſigning of my ſelfe vnto the will of God. Luk. 9.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:11846:70"/>7 I neuer found any ſo religious and deuout, that hath not had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a withdrawing of grace, or felt not a decreaſe of feruour.

He that is taught by the gift of grace, &amp; by the ſcourge of the withdrawing thereof; wil not dare to attribute any good to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; but will rather acknowledge himſelfe poore and naked. Giue vnto God that which is Gods; Mat. 22. and aſcribe vnto thy ſelfe that which is thine owne: that is, giue thankes vnto God for his grace, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that nothing is to be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to thee, but only ſinne, and the puniſhment due thereunto.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Content thy ſelfe, and deſire al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies the meaneſt &amp; loweſt things, and the higheſt ſhall be giuen thee: for the higheſt ſtand not without the loweſt.

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:11846:72"/>
of truth, and heauenly glory, are not deſirous of the vaine-glory of this world. Thoſe that are firmely ſetled and grounded in God, can no way be proud. And they that aſcribe all vnto God, what good ſoeuer they haue receiued, ſeeke not glory one of another: Ioh. 5. but would haue that glory which is from God alone: and deſire aboue all things to praiſe God in himſelfe, and in all the Saints, and alwaies tend vnto the ſame.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Bee therefore gratefull for the leaſt gift, and thou ſhalt bee made worthy to receiue greater. Let the leaſt bee vnto thee alſo as the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt: and the moſt contemptible as an eſpeciall gift. If thou conſider the worth of the giuer, no gift wil ſeeme little, or of meane eſteeme. For it is not little that is giuen by the ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Maieſty of God. Yea if hee ſhould giue puniſhment and ſtripes, it ought to be gratefull, for that hee
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:11846:73"/>
doth it alwayes for our ſaluation, whatſoeuer he permitteth to happen vnto vs. He that deſireth to keep the grace of God, let him be thankefull for the grace giuen, and patient for the taking away thereof. Let him pray that it may returne. Let him be wary and humble, leſt he leeſe it.</p>

               <p>IEſus hath now many louers of his heauenly kingdome, but few bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of his Croſſe. He hath many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of comfort, but few of tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He findeth many companions of his Table, but few of his abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence. Al deſire to rejoyce with him, few will ſuffer any thing for him, or with him. Many follow Ieſus vnto the breaking of bread; but few to the drinking of the Chalice of his Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Many reuerence his miracles, few follow the ignominy of his Croſſe.
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:11846:73"/>
Luk. 9.22. Many loue Ieſus, as long as aduerſities happen not. Many praiſe and bleſſe him, as long as they receiue any comfort from him. But if Ieſus hide himſelfe, and leaue them but a while, they fal either into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, or into too much deiection of minde.</p>
               <p n="2">2 But they that loue Ieſus, for Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and not for ſome comfort of their own, bleſſe him in al tribulation and anguiſh of hart, as wel as in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt comfort. And although he ſhould neuer giue them comfort, they not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding would euer praiſe him, and alwayes giue him thankes.</p>
               <p n="3">3 O how powerfull is the pure loue of Ieſus, which is mixed with no ſelfe-loue nor proper intereſt! Phil. 2. Are they not all to be called hirelings that euer ſeeke comforts? Doe they not ſhew themſelues to be rather louers of themſelues, then of Chriſt, that alwaies think of their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

and gaine? Where may one be found that will ſerue God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out looking for reward?</p>
               <p n="4">4 It is hard to finde any one ſo ſpirituall, that is free from the loue of all earthly things. For where is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that is indeed poore in ſpirit, and free from all affection of creatures? Far hence, and from the end of the world is his price. Prou. 31. If a man ſhould giue all his wealth, yet is it nothing. And if he ſhould doe great penance, yet is it little. And if hee ſhould attaine to all knowledge, hee is yet far off. And if hee ſhould haue great vertue, and very feruent deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet there is much wanting: to wit, one thing which is moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for him. What is that? That lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing all, he forſake himſelfe and goe perfectly from himſelfe, and retaine nothing of ſelfe-loue. Matth. 16. And vvhen hee hath done all that hee knoweth to bee done, let him

Luk. 17. Then may he be truely poore in ſpirit, and naked, and ſay with the Prophet: I am alone and poore: yet no man more powerfull, no man more free then he that can leaue himſelfe and all things, and put himſelfe in the meaneſt and loweſt place.

               <p>VNTO many ſeemeth hard this ſpeech: Deny thy ſelfe, take vp thy croſſe, and follow Ieſus, Mat. 16. But it will be much harder to heare that laſt word: Get ye away from me; ye
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:11846:75"/>
curſed, into euerlaſting fire. For they that now willingly heare and follow the word of the Croſſe, ſhall not then feare to heare the ſentence of euerlaſting damnation. This ſigne of the Croſſe ſhall be in heauen, when our Lord ſhall come to judgement. Then all the ſeruants of the Croſſe, who in their life time conformed themſelues vnto Chriſt crucified, ſhal draw neere vnto our Lord with great confidence.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Why therefore feareſt thou to take vp the Croſſe, which leadeth thee to a Kingdome? In the Croſſe is health, in the Croſſe is life, in the Croſſe is protection againſt our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, in the Croſſe is infuſion of heauenly ſweetneſſe, in the Croſſe is ſtrength of mind, in the Croſſe is joy of ſpirit, in the Croſſe is the height of vertue, in the Croſſe is the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of ſanctity. There is no health of the ſoule, nor hope of euerlaſting
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:11846:75"/>
life but in the Croſſe. Take vp there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy croſſe and follow Ieſus, and thou ſhalt goe into life euerlaſting. Hee is gone before, bearing his Croſſe, Luc. 14. and is dead for thee on the Croſſe; Ioh. 19. that thou mayeſt alſo beare thy Croſſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to die on the Croſſe, with him. For if thou dieſt with him, thou ſhalt alſo liue with him. And if thou bee his companion in paine, thou ſhalt bee partaker with him alſo in glory. 2. Cor. 1.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Behold in the Croſſe all doth conſiſt, and all lyeth in ending our life vpon it: for there is no other way vnto life, and vnto true inward peace, but the vvay of the Holy Croſſe, and of daily mortification. Goe where thou wilt, ſeeke whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer thou wilt: thou ſhalt not finde a higher way aboue, nor a ſafer way belovv, then the vvay of the holy Croſſe. Diſpoſe and order all things
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:11846:76"/>
according to thy will &amp; judgement: yet thou ſhalt euer finde, that of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity thou muſt ſuffer ſomwhat, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther willingly or againſt thy will, ſo as thou ſhalt neuer fully auoid the Croſſe. For either thou ſhalt feele paine in thy body, or in thy ſoule thou ſhalt ſuffer tribulation of ſpirit.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Sometimes thou ſhalt be forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of God, ſometimes thou ſhalt be troubled by thy neighbors, &amp; which is more, oftentimes thou ſhalt bee irkſome to thy ſelfe: neither canſt thou be deliuered or eaſed by any remedie or comfort: but ſo long as pleaſeth God, thou oughteſt to beare it. For God wil haue thee learn to ſuffer tribulation without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; and that thou ſubmit thy ſelfe wholly to him, and become more humble by tribulation. No man hath ſo liuely a feeling of the Paſſion of Chriſt, as hee who hath chanced to ſuffer the like. The Croſſe therefore
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:11846:76"/>
is alwaies ready, and euery where at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth thee. Thou canſt not eſcape it, whither ſoeuer thou flyeſt: for whereſoeuer thou goeſt, thou carieſt thy ſelfe with thee, &amp; ſhalt euer find thy ſelfe both aboue &amp; below, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out and within: which way ſoeuer thou doeſt turne thee, alwaies thou ſhalt find the Croſſe: &amp; euery where of neceſſity thou muſt haue patience, if thou wilt haue inward peace, and deſerue an euerlaſting Crowne.</p>
               <p n="5">5 If thou beare the croſſe willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it wil beare thee, and lead thee to thy deſired end: to wit, where there ſhall be an end of ſuffering, though heere there ſhall not. If thou beare it vnwillingly, thou makeſt for thy ſelf a new burden, &amp; encreaſeſt thy load, and yet notwithſtanding thou muſt beare it. If thou caſt away one croſſe, without doubt thou ſhalt finde ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that perhaps a more heauy.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Thinkeſt thou to eſcape that
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:11846:77"/>
which no man could euer auoid? Which of the Saints in the vvorld was vvithout croſſes and tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? Verily Ieſus Chriſt our Lord was neuer one houre without paine of ſuffering, ſo long as hee liued. Chriſt (ſaith he) ought to ſuffer, and riſe againe from death, and ſo to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into his glory: and how doeſt thou ſeeke any other way, then this high way, which is the way of the holy Croſſe? Luk. 24.</p>
               <p n="7">7 The whole life of Chriſt was a Croſſe and Martyrdome: and doeſt thou ſeek reſt and joy? Thou art de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, thou art deceiued, if thou ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt any other thing, then to ſuffer tribulations: for this whole mortall life is full of miſeries, and inuironed on euery ſide with Croſſes. Iob. 7. And how much the more one hath profited in ſpirit; ſo much the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uier Croſſes he oftentimes findeth: for the loue he beareth to God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:11846:77"/>
the griefe which hee endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth for his baniſhment.</p>
               <p n="8">8 But yet this man; though ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny waies afflicted, is not without the remedy of ſpirituall conſolation, for the great good which he perceiueth to grow vnto him by the bearing of his Croſſe. For whileſt he willingly putteth himſelfe vnder it, all the burthen of tribulation is turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the confidence of diuine comfort. And how much the more the fleſh is vvaſted by affliction, ſo much the more is the ſpirit ſtrengthened by invvard grace. 2. Cor. 11. &amp; 12. And ſometimes hee is ſo comforted with the deſire of tribulation, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie, for the loue of conforming himſelfe to the Croſſe of Chriſt, that he would not wiſh at any time to bee without ſorrow and tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: becauſe hee beleeueth, that ſo much the more gratefull hee ſhall be vnto God, how much the more hee can ſuffer for him. This is not a
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:11846:78"/>
worke of humane vertue; but it is the grace of Chriſt, that can, and doth ſo much in fraile fleſh: that what natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally it alwaies abhorreth and flieth, that, by feruour of ſpirit, it taketh hould on, and loueth.</p>
               <p n="9">9 It is not according to mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to beare the croſſe, to loue the croſſe, to chaſtiſe and ſubdue the body, to fly honors, to ſuffer contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melies with a ioyfull hart, to deſpiſe himſelfe and to wiſh to be deſpiſed, to beare al aduerſities, and domages, and to deſire no proſperity in this world. If thou conſidereſt thy ſelfe, thou ſhalt bee able to performe no ſuch matter of thy ſelfe. 2. Cor. 3. But if thou truſteſt in our Lord, ſtrength ſhall be giuen thee from heauen, and the world and fleſh ſhall bee made ſubiect to thy command. Neither ſhalt thou feare thy enemy the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, if thou be armed with faith, and ſigned with the Croſſe of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="10">10 Reſolue therfore with thy ſelfe,

like a good and faithfull ſeruant of Chriſt, to beare manfully the Croſſe of thy Lord, who was crucified for thy loue. Prepare thy ſelfe to beare many aduerſities and diuers kinds of troubles in this miſerable life: for ſo it will be with thee, wherſoeuer thou be: and ſo ſurely thou wilt finde it, wherſoeuer thou hide thy ſelfe. So it muſt be, and there is no remedy, or means to auoid tribulation &amp; ſorow but to beare them. Drink of the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of our Lord willingly, if thou wilt be his friend, &amp; deſireſt to haue part with him. Mat. 20. Leaue the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of comforts to God: let him do therin as ſhal beſt pleaſe him. Io. 28. Set thou thy heart vpon the ſuffering of tribulations, &amp; account them the greateſt comforts: for that the paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this life are not according to future glory, although thou alone couldeſt ſuffer them all. Rom. 8.</p>
               <p n="11">11 When thou ſhalt come to this eſtate, that tribulation ſhall ſeeme
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:11846:79"/>
ſweet, and pleaſant vnto thee for Chriſt: then thou mayeſt thinke it is well with thee, for thou haſt found a Paradiſe vpon earth. Galath. 6. As long as it is grieuous vnto thee to ſuffer, and that thou deſireſt to flie it; ſo long ſhalt thou be ill at eaſe: and the tribulation thou flieſt will follow thee euery where.</p>
               <p n="12">12 If thou ſetleſt thy ſelfe to that thou oughteſt, to wit, to ſuffer, and to die to thy ſelfe, it will quickly be better with thee, and thou ſhalt find peace. Although thou ſhouldeſt haue beene rapt euen vnto the third hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen with Paul, 1. Cor. 12. thou art not for this aſſured, that thou ſhalt ſuffer no contradiction. I (ſaith Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus) will ſhew him how great things he muſt ſuffer for my name. Act. 9. It reſteth therefore, that thou ſuffer, if thou wilt loue Ieſus, and perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſerue him.</p>
               <p n="13">13 O, would to God thou wert worthy to ſuffer ſomthing for Ieſus!
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:11846:79"/>
How great glory would it be vnto thee, what joy to all the Saints of God, how great edification alſo to thy neighbour! For al do commend patience, though few deſire to ſuffer. With great reaſon thou oughteſt to be willing to ſuffer a little for Chriſt; ſince many ſuffer far greater things for the loue of the world. Pſal. 43.</p>
               <p n="14">14 Know for certaine that thou oughteſt to leade a dying life. And how much the more euery one dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to himſelfe; ſo much the more doth hee begin to liue to God. No man is fit to attaine vnto heauenly things, vnleſſe hee ſubmit himſelfe to the bearing of aduerſities for Chriſt. Nothing is more gratefull vnto God, nothing more vvhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to thee in this vvorld, then to ſuffer vvillingly for Chriſt. And if it were in thy choice, thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt rather wiſh to ſuffer aduerſities for Chriſt, then to enjoy the delight of many comforts: becauſe by theſe
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:11846:80"/>
meanes thou ſhouldeſt be more like vnto Chriſt, and more conformable to all the Saints. For our merit, and the perfection of our eſtate conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth not in much ſweetneſſe and comforts: but rather in ſuffering great afflictions and tribulations.</p>
               <p n="15">15 If there had beene any better thing, and more profitable to the health of man then ſuffering, ſurely Chriſt would haue ſhewed it by word and example. But hee plainly exhorted al the diſciples that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and all that deſire to follow him, to the bearing of the Croſſe, and ſaith: If any man wil come after me, let him deny himſelfe, &amp; take vp his Croſſe and follow me.

And if thou aske the cauſe, heare vvhereof. For a little prebend a long jorney is vndertaken: for euerlaſting life many will ſcarce once lift a foot from the ground.

Deliuer me from euill paſſions, and heale my heart of al inordinate affections: that being cured within, and wel purged, I may be made fit to loue, ſtrong to ſuffer, and conſtant to perſeuere.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Loue is a great matter, in very truth a great good: which alone ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth euery thing that is heauy light; and beareth equally vnequall bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens. Mat. 11. For it carrieth a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den without a burden, and maketh euery thing that is bitter ſweet, and delightſome. The noble loue of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus enforceth man to worke great things, and ſtirreth him vp to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire alwayes the moſt perfect. Loue will be aloft, and not kept downe with any baſe things. Loue will be free from all worldly affection, to

the end his inward ſight be not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured, that he be not intangled with the deſire of any tranſitory gaine, or troubled with the want thereof. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is ſweeter then loue, nothing ſtronger, nothing higher, nothing more ample, nothing more pleaſant, nothing fuller nor better in heauen or in earth: for that loue hath his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning from God, and cannot reſt but in God aboue all creatures.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 He that loueth, flyeth, runneth, and reioyceth, he is free, and not held in. He giueth all for all, and hath all in al, for that he reſteth in one High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt aboue all, from which all good floweth and proceedeth. Hee reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth not the gifts, but turneth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe aboue all goods vnto the giuer. Loue oftentimes knoweth no mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, but inflameth aboue al meaſure. Loue feeleth no burthen, weigheth no paines, deſireth aboue it ſtrength, complaineth not of impoſſibility, for
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:11846:88"/>
that it thinketh all things lawful and poſſible. It is therefore able to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake all things, and performeth and bringeth many things to effect: whereas he that doth not loue, fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and can doe nothing.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 Loue alwaies watcheth, &amp; ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, ſleepeth not: being wearied, is not tired: ſtraitned, is not preſſed: frighted, is not troubled: but like a liuely flame, and burning torch, brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vpwards, and paſſeth through al with great ſecuritie. Rom. 8. If any one loueth, hee knoweth what this voice cries. A lowd cry in the ears of God, is the burning loue of the ſoul, which ſaith: My God, my loue, thou art wholy mine, and I wholy thine.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 Enlarge mee in loue, that my heart may taſte how ſweete it is to loue, and to be diſſolued, &amp; ſwimme in thy loue. Let me be poſſeſſed by loue, mounting aboue my ſelfe, with exceſſiue feruour &amp; admiration. Let

For where one ſeeketh himſelf, there he falleth from loue. 1. Cor. 10.

What hath man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, that thou ſhouldeſt giue him thy grace? Lord, what cauſe haue I to complaine, if thou forſake me? Or if thou doeſt not that which I deſire, what can I juſtly ſay againſt it? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this I may truely thinke and ſay: Lord, I am nothing, I can doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, I haue nothing that is good of my ſelf: but in al things I do faile, and am defectiue, and doe euer tend to nothing: and vnleſſe thou helpe me, and doſt interiourly inſtruct me, I become cold, and am diſſolued.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 But thou, O Lord, art alwayes the ſame, and endureſt for euer, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies

good, juſt and holy, doing all things well, juſt, and holily, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſing al things with wiſdome. Pſa. 101. But I that am more inclined to fall, then to goe forwards, doe neuer continue in one eſtate: for ſeuen dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent times are changed ouer mee, yet doth it ſoone turne to the better, when it ſo pleaſeth thee, and when thou vouchſafeſt to ſtretch forth thy helping hand. For thou alone canſt help me without the fauour of man, and ſo ſtrengthen me, that my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance ſhall be no more changed, but my heart ſhall be conuerted, and reſt in thee alone.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Wherefore, if I could once per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly forſake all humane comfort, either for the loue of deuotion, or for mine own neceſſity, which infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth me to ſeeke after thee (for none elſe can comfort mee) then might I well hope in thy grace, and reioyce in the gift of new conſolation.</p>

                  <p n="2">2 Sonne, fire often burneth, but the flame aſcendeth not vp without ſmoke: ſo likewiſe the deſires of ſome men are earneſtly carried to heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, and yet they are not free from temptation of carnall affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and therefore it is not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther purely for the honour of God,

that which they ſo earneſtly requeſt of him. Such is alſo oftentimes thy deſire, which with ſuch importunity thou preſenteſt vnto me. For that is not pure &amp; perfect, which is infected and defiled with the loue of thine owne proper commodity &amp; intereſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Ask not that which is delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and profitable to thee, but that which is gratefull to me, and apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to my honor, for if thou jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt aright, thou oughteſt to preferre and follow my appointment, rather then thine own deſire, or any deſired thing. I know thy deſire, and haue heard thy often grones. Now thou wouldeſt bee in the freedome of the glory of the ſons of God: now doth the euerlaſting habitation, and the heauenly Country full of joy delight thee, but this houre is not yet come: it is yet another time, to wit, of war, time of labour &amp; triall.

That which is pleaſing to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſhall goe well forwards, that which thou wiſheſt, ſhall not ſpeed. That which others ſay, ſhal be heard, what thou ſayſt ſhall be nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded.

praiſes of men, but of thee there ſhall be no ſpeech; to others this or that ſhall be committed, but thou ſhalt be accounted fit for nothing. At this nature will ſometimes repine, and it is much if thou endureſt it with ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.

And for that thou being placed vnder authority, dareſt not reſiſt a higher power, therefore it ſeemeth hard vnto thee, to walke at the becke of another, and to leaue wholy thine owne opinion.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 But conſider, Sonne, the fruit of theſe labours, the end neere at

hand, and the reward aboue all mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and thou ſhalt receiue no griefe therby, but great comfort of thy pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. For in regard of that little of thy will, which now thou willingly forſakeſt, thou ſhalt alwaies haue thy will in heauen. There thou ſhalt haue all that thou wilt, or canſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire: there thou ſhalt enioy all good without feare of looſing it, there ſhal thy will be euer one with me; it ſhall deſire nothing, ſtrange or priuate; there no man ſhall withſtand thee, no man complaine of thee, no man hinder thee, nothing come againſt thee: but all things deſired ſhall bee there together preſent, and delight thy whole deſire, and fulfill it to the higheſt degree: there I will giue thee glorie for the reproach which heere thou ſufferedſt, a garment of praiſe for former griefe, for the loweſt place, a ſeat of an euerlaſting Kingdome; there ſhall the fruit of

obedience appeare, the labour of pennance reioyce, and humble ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection ſhall bee gloriouſly crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>

                  <p>SOnne, thou art not able alwaies to continue in the feruent deſire of vertue, nor to perſiſt in the high pitch of contemplation, but thou muſt ſometimes of neceſſitie, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of originall corruption, deſcend to inferiour things, and beare the burthen of this corruptible life euen againſt thy will, and with irkeſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. As long as thou carrieſt a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall body, thou ſhalt feele trouble and heauines of hart.

                  <p>LOrd I am not worthy of thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, nor of any ſpiritual viſitation, and therfore thou dealeſt juſtly with me, when thou leaueſt me poore and deſolate. For if I could ſheed teares like a ſea, yet I were not worthy of thy comfort. For (alas) I deſerue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but to be ſcourged &amp; puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in that I haue grieuouſly and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten offended thee, and ſinned in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things.

                  <p n="2">2 What haue I done, O Lord, that thou ſhouldeſt impart any heauenly comfort vnto me? I remember not, that I haue euer done any good, but haue beene alwaies prone to ſin, and ſlouthfull in my amendment. It is true, and I cannot deny it. If I ſhould ſay otherwiſe, thou wouldeſt ſtand againſt me, and there would be none to defend mee. Iob 9. What haue I deſerued for my ſinnes, but hell and euerlaſting fire?

                  <p>SOnne, marke diligently the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thine owne nature, and my grace, for in very contrary and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret manner theſe are moued, and can hardly be diſcerned, but by him that is ſpirituall and inwardly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned. All men deſire that which is good, and pretend ſome good in all their words and deeds, and therefore vnder pretence of good,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:11846:173"/>
many are deceiued. Nature is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull and ſeduceth, intangleth, and deceiueth many, and alwayes propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth her ſelfe for her end, but grace walketh with great ſinceritie, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoideth all ſhew of euill, pretendeth not deceits, and doth all things pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for God, in whom alſo ſhee final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſteth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Nature will not willingly die, nor bee kept in, nor ouercome, nor bee ſubiect to any, nor bee ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued: but Grace laboureth to morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie her ſelfe, reſiſteth ſenſuality, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to be ſubiect, is willing to bee ouercome, and will not vſe her owne libertie, ſhee loueth to be kept vnder diſcipline, and deſireth not to rule any, but alwaies to liue and remaine wholy ſubiect vnto God, and for God, is readie humbly to bow vnto all men. Nature ſtriueth for her owne commoditie, and conſidereth what profit ſhee may reape by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:11846:173"/>
but Grace conſidereth not what is profitable and commodious vnto her ſelfe, but rather what is profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to many. Nature willingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth honour and reuerence: but Grace faithfully attributeth all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and glory vnto God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Nature feareth ſhame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, but Grace reioyceth to ſuffer reproach for the name of Ieſus. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture loueth idleneſſe, and bodily reſt, but Grace cannot be idle, but willingly embraceth labour. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſeeketh to haue thoſe things that bee curious and precious, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horreth that which is meane and baſe: but Grace delighteth in plaine and humble things, deſpiſeth not courſe and meane, nor refuſeth to weare that which is old and torne. Nature reſpecteth the things of this world, reioyceth at earthly gaine, ſorroweth for loſſe, is moued with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery little iniurious word; but Grace
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:11846:174"/>
thinketh on that, which is euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, and cleaueth not to that which fadeth with time; ſhee is not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with loſſe, nor exaſperated with iniuries, for that ſhe hath placed her treaſure and joy in heauen, where nothing periſheth.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Nature is couetous, and doth more willingly receiue then giue, ſhe loueth proper and priuate things: but Grace is pitifull and liberall to all, auoydeth ſingularitie, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with a little, thinketh it happier to giue, then to receiue. Nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineth to creatures, yeeldeth to her owne fleſh, followeth vanities, and liſtneth to diſcourſes: but grace draweth vnto God, and ſeeketh af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vertues, renounceth creatures, fli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the world, hateth the deſires of the fleſh, reſtraineth wandrings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, bluſheth to be ſeene in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like. Nature is willing to haue ſome outward comfort, wherein ſhee may
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:11846:174"/>
delight her ſenſes, but grace ſeeketh comfort in God alone, and deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth aboue all viſible things in the higheſt good.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 Nature worketh all for her owne gaine and profite, ſhee can do nothing freely, but for beſtowed benefits: ſhee hopeth to obtaine either that which is equall, or bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, either praiſe or fauour, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueteth to haue her workes and gifts much eſteemed: but Grace ſeeketh no temporall thing, nor asketh any other reward for her deſerts then God alone, nor deſireth more of temporal neceſſaries, then what may ſerue her for the obtaining of euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting glory.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 Nature rejoyceth to haue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny friends, and kinsfolkes, ſhee glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth of Noble birth and deſcent, pleaſeth the powerfull, fawneth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the rich, applaudeth thoſe that are like her ſelfe: but grace loueth
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:11846:175"/>
her enemies, and is not puffed vp with multitude of friends, nor eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth place or birth, but where it is joyned with greater vertue, ſhee ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fauoureth the poore, then the rich, hath more compaſſion of the innocent, then the powerfull, reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth in the ſimple, and reſpecteth not the deceitfull, exhorteth euer the good to labour for the better gifts, and by vertue to reſemble the Sonne of God. Nature quickely complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of any want and trouble: Grace conſtantly ſuffereth all kinde of need.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 Nature turneth all things to her ſelfe, ſtriueth and contendeth for her ſelfe: but Grace reduceth all to God, from whence originally they proceede: ſhee aſcribeth no good to her ſelfe, neither doth ſhee arrogantly preſume of her ſelfe: ſhe contendeth not, nor preferreth her opinion before others, but in euery
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:11846:175"/>
ſenſe and vnderſtanding ſubmitteth her ſelfe vnto the eternall Wiſdome, and to the diuine Iudgement. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture coueteth to know ſecrets, and to heare newes: ſhee will appeare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and make proofe of many things by the experience of her own ſenſes, ſhee deſireth to be knowne, and to doe thoſe things, for which ſhee may bee praiſed and admired: But Grace careth not for hearing newes, nor to vnderſtand curious matters, for that all this ſpringeth from the ancient diſorder of our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature, ſeeing nothing that is new is durable vpon earth. Shee teacheth therefore to reſtraine the ſenſes, to auoid vaine-pleaſing and oſtentation, humbly to hide thoſe things that are worthy of praiſe and admiration, and of euery thing and euery knowledge to ſeeke profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fruit, and the praiſe and honor of God: ſhe will not haue her ſelfe, nor
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:11846:176"/>
hers, publikely praiſed, but deſireth that God ſhould bee bleſſed in his gifts, who of meere charity beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things.</p>
                  <p n="8">8 Thus Grace is a ſupernaturall light, and a certaine ſpeciall gift of God, and the proper marke of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, &amp; pledge of euerlaſting ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which lifteth vp a man fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly baſenes to loue things of heauen, and of a carnall, maketh him a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall perſon.

For I feele in my fleſh the law of ſinne, contradicting the law of my minde, and leading mee captiue, to obey ſenſuality in many things: neither can I reſiſt the paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thereof, vnleſſe thy holy grace, feruently infuſed into my heart, doe aſſiſt me.

                  <p n="2">2 Thy grace, O Lord, and great grace is needfull, that nature may be ouercome, which is euer prone to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil from her youth. For by Adam the firſt man, in falling and being cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by ſinne, the penalty of this ſtaine hath deſcended vpon all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in ſuch ſort, that Nature it ſelf, which by thee was created good, and without defect, is now accounted

For the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle force which remaineth, is like a certaine ſparke, lying hidden in aſhes.

Arts, riches, beautie, and ſtrength, wit, or eloquence, are of no worth with thee, O Lord, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thy grace. For gifts of nature are common to good and euill, but the
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:11846:178"/>
peculiar gift of the elect is grace and loue, wherewith being marked, they are eſteemed worthy of euerlaſting life. This grace ſo much excelleth, that neither the gift of propheſie, nor the working of miracles, nor any ſpeculation; how high ſoeuer, is of any eſteeme without it.

                  <p>SOnne, beware thou diſpute not of high matters, not of the ſecret judgements of God, why this man is forſaken, and he aſſumed to ſo great grace: why alſo this man is ſo much afflicted, and he ſo greatly aduanced. Theſe things exceede all humane power, neither can any reaſon, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe of any man, ſearch out the judgement of God. When the enemy therfore ſuggeſteth theſe things vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, or ſome enuious people de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them of thee, anſwere that of the Prophet: Thou art juſt, O Lord, and thy judgement is right. Pſa. 218. And againe: The judgements of our Lord are true &amp; juſtified in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues Pſa. 18. My judgments are to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>read, not to be diſcuſſed, for they are
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:11846:183"/>
ſuch as cannot be comprehended by the vnderſtanding of man.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 In like maner I aduiſe thee not to enquire, nor diſpute of the merits of the Saints, which of them is holier then the other, and which is greater in the Kingdome of heauen. Theſe things oftentimes breed ſtrife &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable contentions, they nouriſh alſo pride &amp; vain-glory, from whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce do vſually ſpring enuy &amp; diſſenſions, whilſt one will needs fooliſhly haue this Saint preferred, &amp; the other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. 1. Tim. 2. To deſire to know &amp; ſearch out ſuch things, is to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but to diſpleaſe the Saints, of whom they ſpeake. For I am not the God of diſſenſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but of peace, which peace conſiſteth rather in true humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, then in exalting our ſelues.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Some are carried with zeale of affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to loue theſe, or thoſe moſt, but this loue is rather humane then diuine. I haue made al the Saints, and
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:11846:183"/>
haue giuen them grace: I haue made them partakers of my glory. I know the merits of euery one, I haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented them in the benedictions of my ſweetnes. I foreknew my belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued before the beginning of the world. I choſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the world, they choſe not me firſt. Ioh. 15. I cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them by grace, I drew them by mercy, I led them through ſundry temptations. I haue ſent the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forts, I haue giuen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, I haue crowned their patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 I know the firſt and laſt: I em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace all with ineſtimable loue. I am to be praiſed in al my Saints, I am to be bleſſed aboue al things, and to be honored in euery one, whom I haue thus gloriouſly exalted, and predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated without any precedent merits of their owne. He therefore that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>neth one of the leaſt of my Saints, honoreth not the greateſt, for that I made both the leſſe and the greater.
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:11846:184"/>
Iam. 2. Wiſd. 6. And he that diſprai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth any of my Saints, diſpraiſeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo me, &amp; al the reſt in the Kingdome of heauen. All are one by the band of Charity, they thinke the ſame, they will the ſame, and are all knit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one perfect-band of loue.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 But yet (which is much more high) they loue me more then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, &amp; more then their owne me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. For being rauiſhed aboue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, &amp; drawne out of the affection of themſelues, they tend wholy vnto the loue of mee, in which alſo they reſt, enioying me with vnſpeakable glory. Nothing can put them backe, nothing preſſe them down; for being full of euerlaſting truth, they burne with the fire of vnquenchable chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Let therfore carnal &amp; earthly me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that can affect no other but priuate joyes, forbeare to diſpute of the ſtate of Saints. They adde and take away according to their owne fancies, not
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:11846:184"/>
as it pleaſeth the euerlaſting Truth.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 There is in many great ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, ſpecially in thoſe that bee ſlenderly enlightned, &amp; theſe can ſeldom loue any with perfect ſpiritual loue. They are alwaies much drawne by a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral affection &amp; humane friendſhip, to this man or to that, and according to the experience they haue of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in their earthly affections, ſo they frame an imagination of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things. But there is an inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parable diſtance betweene the things, which the imperfect frame in their conceits, and thoſe which illuminated perſons do ſee by reuelation from aboue.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 Beware therefore, my Sonne, that thou treat not curiouſly of theſe things, which exceed thy knowledg, but rather ſo apply thy endeauours, that thou maiſt at leaſt haue the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt place in the Kingdom of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

in ſanctity, or is eſteemed greater in the kingdom of heauen, what would this knowledge auaile him, vnleſſe he ſhould thereby humble himſelfe the more in my ſight, and ſtirre vp his minde to praiſe my name with greater feruour. His labour is much more acceptable vnto God, that thinketh of the greatnes of his ſins, and his want of vertues, and how far off he is from the perfection of the Saints; then he that diſputeth of their greatnes. It is better to pray to the Saints with deuotion and teares, and to craue their glorious ſuffrages with an humble mind, then to ſearch their ſecrets with a vaine curioſitie.</p>
                  <p n="8">8 They are well, and right well contented, if men could content the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and refraine from theſe vaine diſcourſes. They glory not of their own merits for they aſcribe no good vnto themſelues, but attribute all to me, who of my infinite charity haue
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:11846:185"/>
beſtowed my bleſſings vpon them. They are repleniſhed with ſo great loue of my Godhead, and ſo ſupera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant joy, that there is no glory nor happines, that is, or can be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vnto them. All the Saints, how much the higher they be in glory, ſo much the more humble they are in themſelues, and neerer and dearer vnto me. And therefore thou haſt it written, That they did caſt their crownes before God, and fel downe vpon their faces before the Lambe, and adored him that liueth for euer. Apocal. 4.</p>
                  <p n="9">9 Many enquire who is greateſt in the Kingdome of God, that know not whether they ſhall euer be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred there amongſt the leaſt. It is no ſmall matter to bee euen the leaſt in heauen, where all are great, for that all there ſhall be called, and ſhall be indeed the Sonnes of God. The leaſt there ſhall bee great among thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:11846:186"/>
and the ſinner of an hundred yeares ſhall die. For when the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples asked who was the greater in the Kingdome of heauen, they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued this anſwere. Matth. 18.

Whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer therefore ſhall humble himſelfe as this little childe, he is the greater in the Kingdome of heauen.</p>
                  <p n="10">10 Woe be vnto them that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine to humble themſelues willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with little children. Mat. 6. For the low gate of the Kingdom of heauen, wil not giue them entrance. And wo be to the rich, that haue their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts heere, for whilſt the poore enter into the Kingdom of God, they ſhall be waiting without.

Where thou art, there is heauen: and there is death and hell, where thou art not. Thou art my deſire, and therefore it behoueth mee to ſend forth deep ſighes from my heart, and crie and pray vnto thee. For I haue
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:11846:187"/>
none to truſt vnto, none that can help mee in time of neceſſitie, but thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, my God. Thou art my hope, and my truſt; thou art my comforter, and moſt faithfull vnto mee in all my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes.</p>

But whence is this to me, that thou vouchſafeſt to come vnto mee? Who am I, that thou ſhouldeſt giue thy ſelfe vnto mee? Luk. 1. How dare a ſinner preſume to appeare before thee? And thou, how doeſt thou vouchſafe to come vnto a ſinner? Thou knoweſt thy ſeruant, and ſeeſt that hee hath no good thing in him, for which thou ſhouldeſt beſtow this benefit vpon him. I confeſſe therefore my vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe,

&amp; I acknowledge thy good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: I praiſe thy mercy, and giue thee thanks for this thy vnſpeakable cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. For thou doſt this for thine own goodnes, not for any merits of mine, to the end that thy goodnes may be better knowne vnto me, thy charity more abundantly ſhewed, and thy humility more highly commended. Since therefore it is thy pleaſure, and haſt commanded that it ſhould bee ſo, this thy bounty is alſo pleaſing to me, and do wiſh that my offences may be no hinderance.</p>
               <p n="2">2 O moſt ſweet and bountiful Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu, how great reuerence and thankes with perpetuall prayſe is due vnto thee for the receiuing of thy ſacred Bodie, whoſe worth and dignitie no man is able to expreſſe! But what ſhall I thinke of at this time, now that I am to receiue this diuine Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and to approach vnto my Lord, to whome I am not able to
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:11846:195"/>

What can I thinke better, and more profitable, then to humble my ſelfe wholy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee, and to exalt thy infinite goodnes aboue me? I praiſe thee my God, and wil exalt thee for euer: and I do deſpiſe, and ſubmit my ſelfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, euen into the depth of my vnworthineſſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Behold thou art the Holy of Holies, and I the skumme of ſinners! Behold thou boweſt thy ſelf downe vnto mee, who am not worthy ſo much as to looke vp vnto thee!

For thou ſaidſt the word, and all things were made; and this was done which thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeſt. Gen. 1. &amp; Pſal. 148.</p>
               <p n="5">5 A thing of great admiration, and worthy of faith, and ſurpaſſing the vnderſtanding of man, that thou, my Lord God, true God and Man, ſhouldeſt be wholy contained vnder a ſmall forme of bread and wine, and ſhouldeſt bee eaten by the receiuer without being conſumed.

For ſo, moſt mercifull Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, thou once didſt ſay, preaching to the people, &amp; curing ſundry diſeaſes: I will not ſend them home faſting, leſt they faint by the way.

               <p>IF thou hadſt angelicall purity, and the ſanctity of Saint Iohn Baptiſt, thou wert not worthy to receiue, nor handle this Sacrament. Mat. 11. For it is not within the compaſſe of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts of men, that man ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate and handle the ſacrament of Chriſt, &amp; receiue for food the bread of Angels. A great myſtery, &amp; great is the dignity of Prieſts, to whom is granted that, which is not permitted to the Angels. Pſal. 77. For Prieſts only inſtituted in the Church, haue power to celebrate, and conſecrate the Body of Chriſt. The Prieſt is the Miniſter of God, vſing the words of God, by Gods commandement and appointment; but God is there the principall Actor, and inuiſible wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:11846:202"/>
to whome is ſubiect all that he pleaſeth, and all that hee comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, doth obey. Gen. 1. Pſal. 148. Rom. 9.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Thou oughteſt therfore to giue more credit to God Almightie in this moſt excellent Sacrament, then to thine owne ſenſe, or to any viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſigne. And therefore thou art to come vnto this Myſterie with feare and reuerence. Conſider attentiuely with thy ſelfe, what that is, whereof the Miniſtrie is deliuered vnto thee by the impoſition of hands of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop. Behold thou art made a Prieſt, and conſecrated to ſay Maſſe: ſee now that in due time thou offer Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice vnto God faithfully and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoutly, and carry thy ſelfe ſo, as thou maiſt be without reproofe. 1. Tim. 4. Thou haſt not lightned thy burthen, but art now bound with a ſtraiter band of diſcipline, and art obliged to a more perfect degree of ſanctitie.
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:11846:202"/>
A Prieſt ought to be adorned with al kind of vertues, and to giue exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of good life to others. His con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation ſhould not bee according to the ordinary and common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of men, but like to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in heauen, or to perfect men on earth. Philip. 3.</p>
               <p n="3">3 A Prieſt clothed in ſacred gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is the Vicegerent of Chriſt, to pray humbly, and with a proſtrate mind vnto God for himſelfe and the whole people. Heb. 5. He hath before and behind the ſigne of the Croſſe of our Lord, to the end he may euer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the Paſſion of Chriſt: hee beareth the Croſſe before him in the Veſtement, that hee may diligently behold the foote-ſteps of Chriſt, and feruently endeauour to follow them. Hee is behinde marked with the Croſſe, that he may patiently ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for God, whatſoeuer aduerſities ſhall bee laid vpon him for others.
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:11846:203"/>
He beareth the croſſe before, that he may lament his owne ſinnes, and the ſame hee hath alſo behind, that hee may with a compaſſionate heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile the offences of others, &amp; know that he is placed as a mediatour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God and the ſinner. Neither ought he to ceaſe from prayer &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oblation, till he deſerue to obtaine grace &amp; mercy. When a Prieſt doth celebrate, he honoreth God, reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the Angels, edifieth the Church, helpeth the liuing, giueth reſt to the dead, and maketh himſelfe partaker of all good deeds.</p>

               <p>AS I willingly offered vp my ſelfe vnto God my Father, with my hands ſtretched forth on the Croſſe, and my body naked for thy ſins, ſo that nothing remained in mee that was not turned into a ſacrifice, for the appeaſing of the diuine wrath: ſo oughteſt thou alſo to offer vp thy ſelf willingly vnto me daily in the Maſſe,

Whatſoeuer thou giueſt beſides thy ſelfe, is of little account in my ſight, for I ſeeke not thy gift, but thee.</p>
               <p n="2">2 As it would not ſuffice thee to haue all things whatſoeuer beſides me; ſo neither can it pleaſe mee, whatſoeuer thou giueſt, if thou offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt not vp thy ſelfe. Offer thy ſelfe vnto me, and giue thy ſelfe, all that thou art, for God, and thy offering ſhall be gratefull. Behold I offered vp my ſelfe wholy vnto my Father for thee, and gaue my whole body and bloud for thy food, that I might be wholy thine, and thou remaine mine. But if thou abideſt in thy ſelfe, and doeſt not offer thy ſelfe vp free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnto my will, thy oblation is not

entire, neither ſhall the vnion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene vs be perfect. Therefore a free offering vp of thy ſelfe into the hands of God, ought to goe before all thy actions, if thou wilt obtaine freedome and grace.

               <p n="2">2 Some when they purpoſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the ſacred Communion, ſuffer greateſt aſſaults of the Diuell. For that wicked ſpirit (as is written in Iob) commeth amongſt the Sonnes

But there is no heed to be taken of his frauds and malicious ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, be they neuer ſo filthy and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous, but all is to be turned backe vpon his owne head. Wee ought to contemne and ſcorne him miſerable wretch, and not to omit the ſacred Communion for his aſſaults, and the troubles which he raiſeth.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Oftentimes alſo an exceſſiue care for the obtaining of deuotion, and a certaine anxiety for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of our Confeſſion hindreth vs. Follow in theſe occaſions the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of the wiſe, and put away all
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:11846:210"/>
anxiety and ſcruple, for it hindereth the grace of God, and ouerthroweth deuotion. Omit not (for euery vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the minde which happeneth) to receiue this holy Sacrament, but goe preſently to confeſſion, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly forgiue others, whatſoeuer of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences they haue done againſt thee: and if thou haſt offended any, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly craue pardon, and God will wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly forgiue thee.</p>
               <p n="4">4 What auaileth it to delay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and to defer receiuing? Purge thy ſelfe with ſpeed, ſpit out the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom preſently, make haſt to take a remedy, and thou ſhalt find it better, then if thou deferredſt it long. If thou omitteſt it to day for this cauſe, perhaps to morrow ſome greater wil fall out, and ſo thou mayeſt bee hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred a long time from theſe diuine Myſteries, and become more vnfit.

<pb n="389" facs="tcp:11846:210"/>
force and ſpeed thou canſt. For it profiteth nothing to continue long in diſquietnes and trouble of minde, and for daily incurring impediments to withdraw thy ſelfe from the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments. Yea it hurteth very much to defer Communion long, for it is wont to breed a great and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous dulnes. Alas, ſome cold and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute people, doe willingly delay their confeſſion, and do therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the ſacred Communion, leſt they ſhould bee bound to greater watch ouer themſelues.</p>
               <p n="5">5 O how little charity and weak deuotion haue they, that ſo eaſily o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the receiuing of theſe holy my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries! How happy is he, and grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to God, who ordereth ſo his life, and keepeth his conſcience in ſuch puritie, that hee may bee readie and fit to communicate euery day, if it were conuenient, and might be done without note. If any one ſometimes
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:11846:211"/>
abſtaine of humility, or by reaſon of ſome lawfull impediment, he is to be commended for the reuerence which therein he ſheweth.

When I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member ſome deuout perſons, who come vnto thy Sacrament, O Lord, with great deuotion and affection, I am oftentimes confounded, and bluſh within my ſelfe, that I come ſo negligently and coldly to thy Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, to the Table of holy Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that I remaine ſo drie, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpirituall motion or feeling, that

I am not wholy inflamed in thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, my God, nor ſo earneſtly drawne and moued, as many deuout perſons haue beene, who out of a vehement deſire of receiuing, and a feeling affection of heart, could not containe themſelues from weeping, but with the deſire both of ſoule and body, they earneſtly longed after thee, O God, the liuely Fountaine, being not otherwiſe able to temper nor ſatisfie their hunger, but by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing thy Body with all joy and ſpirituall greedineſſe.</p>

               <p>THou oughteſt to ſeeke the grace of deuotion inſtantly, to aske it earneſtly, to expect it patiently and conſidently, to receiue it joyfully, to keep it humbly, to worke with it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently, and to commit the time and manner of this heauenly viſitation to God, vntill it ſhall be his pleaſure to come. Thou oughteſt chiefly to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thy ſelfe, when thou feeleſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly little or no deuotion, and yet not to be too much deiected, nor to grieue inordinately for it. God often giueth in a ſhort moment that, which he hath long time denied: he giueth ſometimes in the end that, which in the beginning of prayer he differred to grant.</p>

giuen, and at hand euer with a wiſh, it could not be well endured by a weake man. Therefore deuotion is to be expected with good hope, and humble patience: yet impute it to thy ſelfe, and thy ſinnes, when it is not giuen thee, or when it is ſecretly taken from thee. It is ſometimes a ſmall matter that hindreth &amp; hideth grace from vs, if it bee to bee called ſmall, and not rather a great matter, that hindreth ſo great a good.

<pb n="419" facs="tcp:11846:225"/>
into this moſt profound Sacrament, if thou wilt not ſinke into the depth of doubt. He that is a ſearcher of Maieſtie, ſhall be oppreſſed by Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Prou. 25. God is able to worke more then man can vnderſtand. A pious and humble inquirie of truth is tolerable, ſo he be alwaies ready to bee taught, and doe endeauour to walke in the ſound pathes of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers doctrine.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Bleſſed is that ſimplicity, that forſaketh the difficult waies of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, and goeth on in the plaine and aſſured path of Gods Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements. Many haue loſt deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whileſt they would ſearch after high things. Faith and ſincere life are exacted at thy hands, not height of vnderſtanding, nor the depth of the myſteries of God. If thou doeſt not vnderſtand, nor conceiue thoſe things that are vnder thee, how ſhalt thou bee able to comprehend
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:11846:226"/>
thoſe that are aboue thee? Submit thy ſelfe to God, and let thy ſenſe be ſubiect to faith, and the light of knowledge ſhall bee giuen thee in that degree, as ſhall bee profitable and neceſſary for thee.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Some are grieuouſly tempted about Faith and the Sacrament, but this is not to bee imputed to them, but rather to the enemie. Do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard nor diſpute with thy thoughts, neither doe thou giue anſwere to the doubts mooued by the enemie, but beleeue the words of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue his Saints and Prophets, and the wicked Serpent will flie from thee. It is oftentimes very profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the ſeruant of God to ſuffer ſuch things: for he tempteth not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels and ſinners, whom he alreadie ſecurely poſſeſſeth, but hee ſundrie waies tempteth and vexeth the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and deuout.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Goe forward therefore with a

ſincere and vndoubted faith, and come to the Sacrament with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained reuerence. And whatſoeuer thou art not able to vnderſtand, commit ſecurely to Almightie God. God deceiueth thee not: hee is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued that truſteth too much to himſelfe. Pſalm. 18. and 118. God walketh with the ſimple, reuealeth himſelfe to the humble, giueth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to little ones, openeth the ſenſes of pure minds, and hideth grace from the curious and proud. Mat. 11. Humane reaſon is weake, and may be deceiued, but true faith cannot be deceiued.</p>
               <p n="5">5 All reaſon and naturall ſearch ought to follow faith, not to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, nor impugne it.

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F you intend to pleaſe God, and would obtaine grace to fulfill the ſame, two things be vnto you very neceſſary. The firſt, you muſt withdraw your mind from all worldly and tranſitory things, in ſuch maner, as though you cared not whether any ſuch things were in this world or no. The ſecond is, that you giue and apply your ſelfe ſo wholy to God, and behaue your ſelf in ſuch ſort, that you neuer do, ſay, or thinke that you know, ſuppoſe, or beleeue ſhould offend or diſpleaſe God, for by this meanes you may ſooneſt and moſt readily obtaine and winne his fauour and grace. In all things e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme and account your ſelfe moſt vile, and moſt ſimple, and as verie nought, in reſpect and regard of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: and thinke, ſuppoſe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
<pb facs="tcp:11846:228"/>
that all perſons be good and better then you bee, for ſo ſhall you much pleaſe our Lord. Whatſoeuer you ſee, or ſeeme to perceiue in any perſon, or yet heare of any Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, take you no occaſion therein, but rather aſcribe and apply you all vnto the beſt, and thinke or ſuppoſe all is done or ſaid for a good intent or purpoſe, though it ſeeme contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: for mans ſuppoſition and light judgements bee ſoone and lightly deceiued, or beguiled. Deſpiſe no perſon willingly, nor euer ſpeake e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill of any perſon, though it were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo true that you ſay. For it is not lawful to ſhew in confeſſion the vice or default of any perſon, except you might not otherwiſe ſhew and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare your owne offence. Speake little or nothing vnto your proper and ſelfe laude or praiſe, though it were true, and vnto your familier fellow or faithfull friend, but ſtudie
<pb facs="tcp:11846:229"/>
to keepe ſecret and priuie your ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, rather then your vice: yet were it a cruell deed for any perſons to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame themſelues. Be more glad to giue your eare and hearing vnto the praiſe, rather then vnto the diſpraiſe of any perſon, and euer beware as well of hearing, as ſpeaking of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, and when you ſpeake, take good deliberation, and haue few words, and let thoſe bee true and good, ſadly ſet, and wiſely ordered. If any words be ſpoken vnto you of vice or vanity, as ſoone as you may breake off, and leaue that talke or communication. And euer returne and apply your ſelfe vnto ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed good and godly occupation, bodily or ghoſtly. If any ſodaine chance fall or happen vnto you, or vnto any of yours, leane not too lightly thereunto, or care much ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. If it be of proſperitie, reioyce not much therein, or bee ouer glad
<pb facs="tcp:11846:229"/>
thereof: If it be aduerſitie, bee not ouercome or ouerthrowne therwith, or brought to ſorrow or ſadneſſe, thanke God for al, and ſet little ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. Repute all things tranſitory as of little price or value. Giue euer moſt thought and care vnto thoſe things, that may profite and promote the ſoule. Fly and auoid the perſons, and the places of much ſpeech, for better it is to keepe ſilence, then to ſpeake. Keepe the times, &amp; places of ſilence preciſely, ſo that you ſpeak not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reaſonable and vnfained cauſe. The times of ſilence in religion bee theſe. From Collation vntill Maſſe be ended, after the houre of Tierce: from the firſt Grace in the Fratour vntill the end of the latter Grace. And from the beginning of Euen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſong, vntill Grace bee ended after ſupper, or elſe (Benedicite) after the common beuer. The places of ſilence be the Church and Cloiſter, the Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
<pb facs="tcp:11846:230"/>
and the Dortour. If you be ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and doe take occaſion at the fault or offence of any perſon, then looke well vpon your ſelfe, whether you be in the ſame default ſometime your ſelfe, and then haue compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vpon your brother or ſiſter. If there be no ſuch default in you, think verily and beleeue there may be, and then doe as (in like caſe) you would bee done vnto. And thus, as in a glaſſe, you may ſee and behold your ſelfe. Grudge not, neither complaine vpon any perſon for any manner of cauſe, except you ſee and perceiue by large coniecture, that you may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and edifie thereby. Neither deny, nor affirme your minde or opinion ſtiffely or extremely, but that your affirmation, denegation, or doubt be euer powdred with ſalt, that is to ſay, wiſdome, diſcretion and patience. Vſe not in any wiſe to mocke, check, or ſcorne, neither yet to laugh or
<pb facs="tcp:11846:230"/>
ſmile but right ſeldome. And that alway to ſhew reuerence or louing manner, light countenance or looſe behauiour becommeth not a ſad per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Let your communication bee ſhort, and with few perſons, alwaies of vertue, learning, or good &amp; Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian edification, and euer with ſuch warineſſe, that no perſon in things doubtfull may take any authoritie of your words or ſentence. Let all your paſtime be ſpent in bodily labours, good and profitable, or elſe godly in ſtudy, or that paſſeth all, in holy and deuout prayer, ſo that the heart and mind be occupied with the ſame you ſpeake. And when you pray for any certaine perſons, remember their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, eſtate &amp; condition. For a forme and order of your prayer, this may bee a good and ready way, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the order of the ſix Gramaticall caſes: The nominatiue, the genitiue, the datiue, the accuſatiue, the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catiue,
<pb facs="tcp:11846:231"/>
and the ablatiue. The nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiue, that is, firſt to pray for your ſelfe, that you may haue ghoſtly ſtrength and conſtancie, that you fall not into any deadly offence by frailtie, and that you may haue right knowledge of God by faith, and of your ſelfe, by due conſideration of your eſtate and condition, and of the lawes of God for your conduct and countenance: and thirdly, that you may haue grace and good will, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſame ſtrength and knowledge, and that hauing vnto God a reuerend dread, you neuer of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend in thought, word, or deed, but that you may euer loue him for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and all his creatures in due or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for him, and in him. The ſecond is the genitiue caſe. Then muſt you pray for your genitours, your proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitours and parents, that is to ſay, your fathers and mothers, ſpirituall and carnall, as your ghoſtly fathers,
<pb facs="tcp:11846:231"/>
or ſpirituall ſoueraignes, your god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, your godmothers, your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural father and mother, your grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers and grandmothers, your bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and ſiſters, and all your kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. In the third place is the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue caſe. There muſt you pray for benefactors, good doers, of whom you haue receiued any manner of gifts ſpirituall or temporall, vnto the wealth of your ſoule or body. In the fourth place is the accuſatiue caſe, where you ſhould pray for your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, ſuch perſons as by any meanes haue annoyed, hurt, or grieued you, either ghoſtly or bodily, that is to ſay, in your ſoule or manners by any ſuggeſtion, intiſing, euill counſell, or euill example. In your fame or good name, by detraction, back-biting, or ſlandering, or yet by familier com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. For a perſon commonly is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted &amp; ſuppoſed to be of ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as they bee, with whom hee
<pb facs="tcp:11846:232"/>
hath conuerſation &amp; company. And for them that hurt your body, either by ſtrokes, or by any other occaſion haue hindered the ſtate and health thereof. And likewiſe of your world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly goods or poſſeſſions. For all theſe manner of enemies muſt you pray, that our Lord God would forgiue them as you doe, and as you would be forgiuen, and that they may come to right charity and peace. The fifth caſe is called vocatiue, that is to ſay, the calling caſe, where you conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently may call, cry, and pray vnto our Lord for all manner of perſons that be out of the ſtate of grace, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by infidelity, as Turkes, Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, and ſuch other: or elſe by er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, as all manner of Heretikes: or elſe by any deadly ſinne or offence to God. Pray for all theſe manner of perſons, that they may come vnto the right way of their ſaluation. In the ſixt and laſt place is the ablatiue
<pb facs="tcp:11846:232"/>
caſe, where thou muſt pray for all thoſe that be taken out of this life, &amp; that died or paſſed the ſame life in charitie, &amp; now haue need of prayer. In the which you may keep a forme of the ſame order that is before, that is to ſay: In ſtead of the nominatiue, where you prayed for your ſelfe, you may now pray for all thoſe that doe abide in paine for any default or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence done by your example or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion: and for the genitiue in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place, for your parents, and all your kindred departed this life: and in the third place for the datiue, pray for your benefactors paſſed: and for the accuſatiue in the fourth place, you may pray for them that liue in paine, for any occoſion or example that they gaue vnto you: and in the fift place for the vocatiue, pray for al them that haue greateſt pains in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, &amp; leaſt help heere by the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage of prayers: and for the ablatiue
<pb facs="tcp:11846:233"/>
in the ſixt and laſt place, pray for all ſoules in generall. And that you may be the more apt to pray, call three things oft times to remembrance, that is to ſay, what you haue beene, what you be, and what you ſhall be. Firſt, by reaſon of your body, you were conceiued of the moſt filthy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable matter of man, ſhamefull to be ſpoken, far more vile then the ſlime of the earth, and after borne in a ſinfull ſoule, and purged only by grace. And now (as vnto the body) you bee a muckheape or dunghill of filth, more vile then any vpon earth if you remember what doth iſſue dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and come forth out of the meates of your body. And your ſoule is dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in ſome ſin, or (at the leaſt) full like to be. What you ſhall bee, as vnto your body, you may ſee by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, wormes meat, &amp; earth againe. And what ſhal become of your ſoul, no man in this world can aſſure you.
<pb facs="tcp:11846:233"/>
To remember then the joyes of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and paines of hell, and that both be infinit, endleſſe, and without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, but both euer encreaſing, and neuer ceaſing, neuer haue eaſe nor reſt, but euer continue &amp; euerlaſting. To remember then, I ſay, theſe things may greatly mooue you to behaue your ſelfe in a good ſort, &amp; to ſtudie how you may auoid the one, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the other. Remember ſpecially how great a loſſe it is to loſe heauen, and how vncomfortable gaines to winne hell, and how ſoone and how lightly either of them may be gotten or loſt. When any thing then, of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſity, hurt or diſpleaſure, happen vnto you, thinke then, or imagine, that if you were in hell, you ſhould haue the ſame diſpleaſure, and many worſe. And ſo to auoid thoſe, you ſhall heere the better ſuffer, and for our Lord the more patiently beare al theſe that now bee preſent, or any
<pb facs="tcp:11846:234"/>
that may come hereafter. And in like manner, if any good proſperity or pleaſure happen vnto you, think then that if you were in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, you ſhould haue that pleaſure, and many mo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent joyes. And ſo for the feruent deſire of thoſe joyes, you ſhall ſet lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle by any worldly comfort or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. A good contemplation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may it bee vnto you in feaſts of holy Saints, to thinke &amp; record how great paines they ſuffred here for the loue of our Lord, &amp; how ſhort theſe were, &amp; how ſoone paſſed: and then againe, how marueilous reward they had therefore in bliſſe and joy euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting. So the troubles and torments of good perſons be ſoone &amp; ſhortly gone and ended, and the joyes and pleaſures of ſinfull perſons do ſoone fade and fly for euer. The good per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, for their troubles ſuffered heere vpon earth, doe get and win eternall and euerlaſting glory, which the euil
<pb facs="tcp:11846:234"/>
perſons do loſe. And contrary, theſe euill and ſinfull perſons, for their joy and pleaſure heere, do receiue by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change eternall &amp; euerlaſting ſhame and rebuke, with paine and woe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable. Whenſoeuer then you be diſpoſed to ſluggiſhneſſe, or to bee drowſie, remiſſe in prayers, or dull in deuotion, then take this little worke, or els ſome other good Treatiſe, and reade therein, and euer note well the contents thereof, and what is meant thereby. And if you be not thereby deliuered or eaſed thereof, then ſhift vnto ſome other work or occupatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſo that euer you auoid idlenes, and al vaine paſtimes, which indeed is loſſe of time. And then remember, that thoſe that now abide in paine, either in hell, or yet in Purgatory, for ſuch times ſo paſſed or loſt, had rather then all the world haue ſuch time to redeeme their paines by, as you may haue if you will. Time then vnto all
<pb facs="tcp:11846:235"/>
perſons well occupied, is very preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and deare. Take good heede therefore, how you ſpend it or paſſe it, for you can neuer reuoke it or call it backe. If the time paſſe you by trouble and vexation, thinke they be happy and gracious, that be paſt this wretched life, and now in bliſſe, for they ſhall neuer haue any ſuch miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. And when you feele a comfort or conſolation ſpirituall, thanke God therof, and thinke the damned ſoules ſhall neuer haue any ſuch pleaſure. And thus let this bee for your exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe in the datiue. At night when you goe to reſt, firſt make account with your ſelfe, and remember how you haue ſpent or paſſed the day &amp; time that was giuen you to bee vſed in vertue, and how you haue beſtowed your thoughts your words, and your workes. And if you finde no great thing amiſſe, giue the whole laude and praiſe vnto our Lord God. And
<pb facs="tcp:11846:235"/>
if you perceiue contrary, that you haue miſpent any part thereof, bee ſory therefore, and beſeech our Lord of mercie and forgiuenes, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and verily purpoſe to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends the next day. And if you haue oportunitie thereupon, it ſhall be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conuenient for you to bee confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the next morning, and eſpecially, if the matter done, ſaid, or thought, by deliberate conſent, doe grieuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weigh and worke with a grudge in your conſcience, then would I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe you neuer to eate nor drinke, till you bee diſcharged thereof, if you may conueniently get a ghoſtly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Now for a concluſion of this worke, put before you, as by caſe or imagination, two large Cities, one full of trouble, turmoile and miſery, and let that bee hell. The other Citie full of joy, gladneſſe, comfort, and pleaſure, and let that bee heauen. Looke well on them
<pb facs="tcp:11846:236"/>
both, for in both be many dwellers and great company. Then caſt and thinke within your ſelfe, what thing heere might ſo pleaſe you, that you ſhould chooſe the worſe Citie, or what thing ſhould diſpleaſe you on the other part, whereby you ſhould withdraw your ſelfe from that ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue that might conuey and bring you vnto the other Citie. And when you haue ſtudied well hereupon, and can nothing finde, I dare well aſſure you, if you keepe well the precepts and counſailes of this little Leſſon, you ſhall finde the right way, for the holy Ghoſt will inſtruct and teach you, where you be not ſufficient of your ſelues, ſo you endeauour and giue diligence to beare away and follow that which heere is taught. Reade it euery weeke once or twice, or oftner if you will. And where you profite, giue the thankes, laude and praiſe vnto our Lord God, and
<pb facs="tcp:11846:236"/>
moſt ſweet Sauiour Ieſu Chriſt, who ſend you his mercie and grace, that alway liueth God world without end. Amen.</p>

            <head>THE RVLES OF A CHRISTIAN LIFE, made by IOHN PICVS the elder, Earle of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randula.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Irſt, if to man or woman the way of vertue doth ſeeme hard or painefull, becauſe wee muſt needes fight againſt the fleſh, the diuell, and the world, let him or her call to remembrance, that whatſoeuer life they will chooſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the world, many aduerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, incommodities, much heauines and labour are to be ſuffered.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, let them haue in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, that in wealth &amp; world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſeſſions is much and long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, laborious alſo, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with vnfruitfull, wherein trauaile is the concluſion or end of labour, and
<pb facs="tcp:11846:238"/>
finally, paine euerlaſting, if thoſe things be not well ordered, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably diſpoſed.</p>
            <p>Remember alſo, that it is very fooliſhneſſe, to thinke to come vnto heauen by any other meanes, then by the ſaid battaile, conſidering that our head and Maſter Chriſt did not aſcend vnto heauen, but by his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: and the ſeruant ought not to be in better eſtate or condition then his Maſter or Soueraigne.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, conſider that this battaile ought not to be grudged at, but to be deſired and wiſhed for, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though thereof no price or reward might enſue or happen, but onely that thereby wee might bee confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med or joyned to Chriſt our God and Maſter. Wherefore as often as in reſiſting any temptation, thou doeſt withſtand any of thy ſenſes or wits, think vnto what part of Chriſts paſſion thou mayeſt apply thy ſelfe,
<pb facs="tcp:11846:238"/>
or make thy ſelfe like: As reſiſting gluttonie, whileſt thou doeſt puniſh thy taſte or appetite: remember that Chriſt receiued in his drinke, ayſell mixed with the gall of a beaſt, a drinke moſt vnſauoury and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.</p>
            <p>When thou vvithdraweſt thine hand from vnlawfull taking or kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of any thing, which liketh thine appetite, remember Chriſts hands, as they were faſt nailed vnto the tree of the Croſſe. And reſiſting of pride, thinke vpon him, who being very God almightie, for thy ſake recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the forme of a ſubiect, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himſelfe vnto the moſt vile and reproachfull death of the Croſſe. And when thou art tempted with wrath: Remember that hee, which was God, and of all men the moſt juſt and righteous, when hee beheld himſelfe mocked, ſpit on, ſcourged, and puniſhed with all diſpites and
<pb facs="tcp:11846:239"/>
rebukes, and ſet on the Croſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene two theeues, as if he himſelfe were a falſe harlot, hee notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſhewed neuer token of indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or that he were grieued, but ſuffering all things with wonderfull patience, anſwered all men moſt gently. In this wiſe, if thou peruſe all things one after another, thou mayeſt finde, that there is no paſſion or trouble, that ſhall not make thee in ſome part conformable or like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Alſo put not thy truſt in mans helpe, but in the onely vertue of Chriſt Ieſu, which ſaid: Truſt well, for I haue vanquiſhed the world. and in another place hee ſaith: The Prince of this world is caſt out there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Wherefore, let vs truſt by his onely vertue, to vanquiſh the world, and to ſubdue the Diuell. And therefore ought wee to aske his helpe by our owne prayers, and by
<pb facs="tcp:11846:239"/>
the prayers of his bleſſed Saints.</p>
            <p>Remember alſo, that as ſoone as thou haſt vanquiſhed one temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, alway another is to bee looked for: The Diuell goeth alway about and ſeeketh for him whom he would deuour. Wherefore wee ought to ſerue diligently and be euer in feare, and to ſay with the Prophet: I will ſtand alway at my defence.</p>
            <p>Take heed moreouer, that not onely thou bee not vanquiſhed of the Diuell, that tempteth thee, but alſo that thou vanquiſh and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come him. And that is not onely when thou doeſt not ſinne, but alſo when of that thing wherein hee tempted thee, thou takeſt occaſion for to doe good. As if hee offereth to thee ſome good act to bee done, to the intent that thereby thou maiſt fall into vaine-glorie: forthwith thou thinking it, not to bee thy deede or worke, but the benefite or
<pb facs="tcp:11846:240"/>
reward of God, humble thou thy ſelfe, and judge thee to bee vnkinde vnto God in reſpect of his manifold benefits.</p>
            <p>As often as thou doeſt fight, fight as in hope to vanquiſh, and to haue at the laſt perpetuall peace. For that peraduenture God of his abundant grace ſhall giue vnto thee, and the Diuell being confuſed of thy victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, ſhall returne no more againe. But yet when thou haſt vanquiſhed, beare thy ſelfe ſo, as if thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt fight againe ſhortly. Thus al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in battaile, thou muſt thinke on victory; and after victory, thou muſt prepare thee to battaile immediatly againe.</p>
            <p>Although thou feeleſt thy ſelfe well armed and readie, yet flye (notwithſtanding) all occaſions to ſinne. For as the Wiſeman ſaith: Who loueth perill, ſhall therein periſh.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:11846:240"/>In all temptations reſiſt the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and beate the children of Babylon againſt the ſtone, which ſtone is Chriſt, and the children bee euill thoughts and imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For in long continuing of ſinne, ſeldome worketh any medicine or remedie.</p>
            <p>Remember, that although in the ſaid conflict of temptation the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile ſeemeth to be very dangerous: yet conſider how much ſweeter it is to vanquiſh temptation, then to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſinne, whereto ſhee inclineth thee, whereof the end is repentance. And herein many be foulely decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, which compare not the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of victorie to the ſweetneſſe of ſinne, but onely compareth battaile to pleaſure. Notwithſtanding, a man or woman, which hath a thouſand times known what it is to giue place to temptation, ſhould once aſſay, what it is to vanquiſh temptation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:11846:241"/>If thou bee tempted, thinke thou not therefore that God hath forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken thee, or that hee ſetteth but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle by thee, or that thou art not in the ſight of God, good or perfect: but remember, that after Saint Paul had ſeene God, as hee was in his Diuinitie, and ſuch ſecret myſteries as bee not lawfull for any man to ſpeake or rehearſe, hee for all that ſuffered temptation of the fleſh, wherewith God ſuffered him to bee tempted, leſt he ſhould be aſſaulted with pride. Wherein a man ought to conſider, that Saint Paul, which was the pure veſſell of election, and rapt into the third heauen, was not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding in perill to be proud of his vertues, as hee ſaith of himſelfe. Wherefore aboue all temptations men or women ought to arme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues moſt ſtrongly againſt the temptations of pride, ſince pride is the roote of all miſchiefe, againſt
<pb facs="tcp:11846:241"/>
the which, the onely remedie is to thinke alway that God humbled himſelfe for vs vnto the Croſſe. And moreouer that death hath ſo hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled vs, whether wee will or no, that our bodies ſhall be the meat of worms loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous.</p>
