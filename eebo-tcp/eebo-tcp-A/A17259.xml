         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Honourable) how many that
haue ſome deſire to wake in
right wayes and perfect paths,
are ſeduced and miſſe-led, and
that willingly, hauing this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion
once ſetled in their
hearts, that the biſhop of Rome
is their head here vpon earth, whom they ought to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey:
Seeing alſo on the other ſide, not a fewe, that
cloke and colour many their trecheries and treaſons,
when they ſuffer as euil doers for their wicked purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
and practiſes, as if for their conſcience ſake they
were thus delt withall; I thought I could not beſtow
time better, then if by any means poſſible, I might by
my paine &amp; trauel, light the candle of trueth to them
that are in darkneſſe and ignorance, and diſcouer the
hypocriſie of the other ſort, who vnder pretence of
<pb facs="tcp:7294:3"/>
conſcience, doe againſt all conſcience and duetie.
Both which partes, my deſire hath bene to performe
in this treatiſe. For if by triall of the Popes title, and
examining his euidence I prooue that he maketh an
vniuſt claime, to the ſupremacie ouer the whole
Church of Chriſt: and if in view of his doings, and
proofe of his practiſe it may plainlie appeare,<note place="margin">Iohn 10. 1, 10.</note> that as
he like a thiefe entred into that honor that now he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyeth,
ſo in the ſame he plaieth the thiefe in deed, &amp;
doeth nothing els but rob and ſteale, and kill: I hope
then the ſimple, and ſo the better ſort of the two, will
not ſo readilie as they haue done reſt vpon him, in
whom they ſhall ſee neither warrant, power to haue
his fulneſſe of power, nor any Chriſtian-like modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to vſe the ſame: And as for the other ſort, they
will finde no cauſe for them to crake of their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
when it ſhal appeare to the world, that it is not
vpon any ſure ground, neither ſtaied vpon any good
foundation. For doubtleſſe, if a good conſcience doe
giue vnto Caeſar that that is Caeſars or belongeth to
him,<note place="margin">Mat. 22. 21</note> whether obedience, tribute, or any thing elſe, as
Chriſt commaundeth: If it make ſubiects to ſubiect
their very ſoules to the higher powers, as S. Paul bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 1.</note>
and frameth vs to ſubmit our ſelues to all maner
ordinance of man for the Lordes ſake, as Saint Peter
willeth:<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2. 13.</note> And if theſe dueties of inferiours towardes
their ſuperiours, muſt bee performed for conſcience
ſake, as the ſame Apoſtle exhorteth vs, and S. Paul al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
Rom. 13. 5. I pray you what conſcience can there
bee in denying their obedience to their Soueraigne,
and giuing it to another? or in preferring him whom
their ſelues haue made their prince and king, that Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh
prieſt, before ſuch as God hath ſet ouer vs?
<pb facs="tcp:7294:3"/>
doubtleſſe, if in conſcience wee bee bound to obey
God, then can no man haue ſo much as a ſhewe of
conſcience, ſo to robbe Gods magiſtrates of that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
that he giueth them, as doeth the church of
Rome. Men ſometime will make conſcience where
none is, as theſe men do, in tying themſelues to keep
other lawes then God hath giuen them. And if their
ſinne were no greater then ſo, yet ſhould they haue
no more thankes at Gods hand, then the Iewes had
for ſuch will-worſhippings, who when they looked
to merite by ſuch works,<note place="margin">Eſa. 1. 12.</note> it was ſaid vnto them, Who
hath required theſe things at your hands? But ſeeing
the iudgement wherein we and our workes muſt bee
tried,<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 16.</note> ſhall bee according to the Goſpel: that muſt
bee the touch ſtone, the rule and the ſquare to

conſcience in waſhing before meate, and many ſuch
like things: but they are reproued of Chriſt, becauſe
they were ſo carefull to keepe thoſe their owne tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
ſo little regarding Gods commaundements;
and yet their clenſings might ſeeme to be ſome imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Gods law. But with what forehead can the
church of Rome pretend any conſcience in doing
that which is expreſſely againſt that honour which
God commaundeth to bee giuen to magiſtrates, and
contrary to the humble duetie that good biſhops of
the purer age did alwayes performe? It is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
conſcience carefully ſetled on Gods word, that
any of them doeth ſuffer for: but for their doings that
are expreſly againſt the ſame. For howſoeuer the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer

the euidence that hath bene ſufficiently and plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully

which themſelues confeſſe to be the principal
worke of their Prieſt among vs, and whereof the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the forenamed anſwere, ſayeth that it can no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all, touch or trouble the quiet of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey:
yet becauſe it is a vniting (of them that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled)
vnto the Pope: (who is not onely a ſpeciall
enemie to our moſt gratious Soueraigne, but alſo a
tirannous tormentour of all ſuch as will not holde
their kingdomes of him, as many Stories doe proue)
it is therefore a withdrawing of them, from their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and obedience towards her Maieſtie, whenſoeuer
the Pope ſhall ſo commaund. Yea one whom them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
truſt in great matters (called <hi>Bruiſe</hi> I ſuppoſe,<note place="margin">Among the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters taken with Car the Hiſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uioliſed Scot.</note>

that as they conuert the ſoules of ſuch as they
deale withall ſo euen then in the ſame inſtant they
doe affectionate them to the Catholicke King. What
plainer words can there be to ſhew to what end this
reconciling tendeth? You ſee Poperie and treaſon
muſt bee taught together, they muſt bee as twinnes,
they muſt grow together, and go together, foote by
ſoote. Yea now a dayes it is not right Popery, vnleſſe
it bring forth ſome treacherie. What hath their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke

no other day then that, which they hoped, the
rebellion in England, the troubles in Ireland, the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> fleete ſo long looked for, and ſo much ſpoken
of, ſhould haue brought vnto them. Againſt ſuch
dayes of miſchiefe they ſeeke to praepare men before
by their reconciling, as that letter of <hi>Bruiſe</hi> before
mentioned, and many other vnanſwerable proofes
doe teach vs. And therefore ſeeing that vnder prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of reconciling men to God, they doe in deede
by all meanes poſſible deuote and tye them to ſerue
the Pope, and that inſatiable tirant, who haue a long
time, by many wicked and Popelike practiſes, ſhewed
themſelues vtter enemies to our eſtate and Prince:
what reaſon can be yeelded, why Princes may not by
moſt ſeuere puniſhments, preuent the perillous pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
of ſuch ſecret conſpiratours, and knowen ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies?
May Popes vſe pollicies to get authoritie,
which by no right they can claime, and to keepe it
when they haue obtained it, (as in this treatiſe it will
appeare they did:) and may not Princes prouide for
the ſafetie of their perſons, the eſtabliſhing of their
kingdomes, and the maintenance of their ancient
and lawfull dominions? May vſurpers keepe that
<pb facs="tcp:7294:5"/>
which wickedly they haue gotten, and may not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Kings and Queenes defend their true and right
inheritance? Or muſt they ſuffer ſuch ſerpents with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
their kingdomes, ſuch ſnakes as it were in their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes.
Wee cannot let ſuch fugitiue traitours, as
ſeeke the ruine of their natiue countrey, to wiſh alſo
that ſuch ready meanes to effect their deſires, might
not be hindred. No we cannot hinder their attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the ſame, by their ſeditious pamphlets. But
wee hope that all Chriſtian princes, that knowe theſe
their lewd practiſes, not truſting the ſongs of thoſe
Syrens, will before it be too late, ſeeke to preuent the
meanes that they vſe to bring them to paſſe. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
need they who cal themſelues (though vntruely)
Catholikes, and maintaine the Romiſh religion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
their Dominions,<note place="margin">Cap. 4.</note> feare ſo to doe. For <hi>Allen</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
(if that bee his anſwere to the Engliſh Iuſtice)
dare not ſay it is a matter yet defined, but diſputable
onely, whether the Pope may excommunicate or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue
a Prince in caſe of haereſie or apoſtacie, and
conſequently to abſolue his ſubiects from their othe
and obedience to him. If this be a caſe yet not ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled
in the Popes Conſiſtorie, or at the leaſt in any
general Council; then euen Popiſh princes need not
bee afraide to withſtand by all meanes that they can,
ſuch dangerous deceiuers as come in ſheepes cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
making ſhewe of Religion, but are in deede raue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
wolues, ſecretly working treaſon. In ſo much as
they who fauour but too well the Romiſh Religion,
beginne now to know and deteſt theſe rouing runna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates,
whoſe counſels are miſchieuous, whoſe doings
are treacherous. And becauſe the very ground of
this their brag, that they ſuffer for conſcience ſake,
<pb facs="tcp:7294:5"/>
is this ſupremacie of the B. of Rome, and his power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
all, not Biſhops only, but Princes alſo: which they
would haue to be an article of religion, &amp; ſo to touch
the conſcience, whereas it is in trueth, but a matter
of Popiſh pride and ambition: for this cauſe haue I
indeuoured in this treatiſe, to proue that it hath no
warrant in the word, or in the writings of the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

a litle light vnto the trueth, to know by what practiſes
they are become ſo great, and to what ends they haue
bent, or how they haue imployed their power which
they haue gotten by craft and ſhifts: I haue therefore
pointed vnto ſuch meanes as they haue vſed to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance
their ſeat, and to ſome of their doings. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it doeth moſt plainly appeare, that their only care
hath bin to make themſelues great and rich, nothing
at al regarding the glory of God, or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good of Chriſts
flocke, which they ſay is committed to them. And
this I haue done by ancient or their owne hiſtories,
ſeldome ſtanding vpon the credit onely of our owne
writers, vnleſſe it bee in report of the actes of the later
Popes, which cannot be reported by any but ſuch as
were in, or after their dayes. But if I had more relied
then I doe, vpon the reportes of <hi>Proteſtant</hi> writers, I
ſhould haue the example of our aduerſaries for my
defence. This treatiſe I ſet forth vnder the defence
of your honours name, to whom I acknowledge my

do I am the rather moued, that to that inward witnes

the perilous practiſes of thoſe buſie brokers for
that Catholique king (as they call him) &amp; other ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to this Common wealth, might alſo bee added
that outwarde teſtimonie of trueth, confirmed by
proofe and practiſe of the purer times, to incourage
you with a conſtant increaſe in godly zeale, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
ſtil the duetie, that God (who hath called you
to that honour) hath layde vpon you, and requireth
of you, to the ſeruice of her Maieſtie, and ſafetie of
her ſubiectes. Moſt humbly I craue you to take in
good part this ſimple token of a ſincere affection,
and ſlender pledge of my vnfained heart. And thus
committing the happie ſucceſſe of this my traueile

I humbly take my leaue at my houſe at Ryton

Neither must we reſt vpon any of their doctrines, but ſuch

ſeeme to haue, are yet farre from the power thereof. For it
cannot be, that any man or woman that maketh due account
of the price of our redemption, the ranſome for our ſinnes,
the precious bloud of that lambe without ſpot Christ Ieſus,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 1. 19.</note>

whom Christ hath bought with ſo rich a ranſome. Hide not
the trueth from them henceforth with thoſe falſe viſardes

Chriſt and his Apoſtles. And this he ſaieth, is the readieſt

they muſt ſtedfaſtly beleeue, that the Biſhop of Rome is the

that man of ſinne, hauing ſo bewitched the hearts of his fauorites,
that they are once perſuaded, that it is good religion ſo to beleeue,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:7294:9"/>

do owe to their countrey wherein they were bred and brought vp,
the ſweete fruit of loue to her, and ſacred obedience to her lawes,
bring forth almoſt nothing elſe, but the ſowre grapes of treaſons

falſly perſwade themſelues, that they owe their chiefe obedience to
the Biſhop of Rome, whoſe commaundements if they obey, and
follow his directions, and hearken to his perſwaſions, then muſt
they ſuffer no princes, with qnietneſſe to enioy their ancient and
vndoubted inheritance, and rightfull crownes, but ſuch as will be
tenants at will, to their lawleſſe maſter. Which, the more I doe
thinke of it, the more (I feare) we haue no great hope as yet to be
free from ſuch villainous practiſes, as may bring danger vnto her
Maieſtie, and ruine to this realme: becauſe I ſee that ſtubburne
Recuſants (who if they haue any conſcience in religion, it is very
ſtrange, for many of them ſhew little conſcience in any thing elſe)
wilfull Papiſts (I ſay) are not in ſome reaſonable maner forced in
this point, to ſhew their obedient and dutiful hearts, but may free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

for the church of God, whoſe kingdome is not worldly,
whoſe beauty is not outward or external. But to knit vp this point
with one argument, thus I reaſon. That kind of gouernement is

himſelfe denieth.<note place="margin">De pontif. Rom. lib. 2. cap. 12.</note> Secondly the paſtor contenteth himſelfe
with the miniſtrie of the word and ſacraments, and ſuch eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall

Rome deſpiſeth all power, abuſeth all magiſtrates, yea almoſt
treadeth vnder foote the maieſtie of the mightieſt monarches. As
for the ſword of the word either he thinkes it not ſharp enough,<note place="margin">His contempt of the ſword of Gods word.</note> or
elſe he is too proude to drawe it (for preaching is too baſe a thing
for ſo proude a prelate) but with his temporall ſword he floriſheth
luſtily. Againe, the paſtor hath his flock in a litle compaſſe, ſo
that he may in ſome meaſure diſcharge his dutie amongſt them, he

ouer all places and perſons, and ſeeking to bee head ouer
all churches, doth both meddle with other mens charges, and lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
vpon his owne ſhoulders an importable burthen. Thus I
truſt it appeareth, that this argument ſtandeth ſtill vnanſwered
Chriſt is the head of his church, Chriſt I ſay whom God the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
appointed to that office, and who is able to vndergoe this
charge,<note place="margin">Tertull. de prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientia haeretic.</note> becauſe he hath the holy ghoſt to be his <hi>Houſband man,</hi>
to dreſſe his vine, his <hi>Vicar or leieutenant</hi> to looke to his charge:
the pope therefore, who is neither appointed to it, nor able to doe
it, is not.<note place="margin">M. Bellar. his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond argument.</note> Now for that which maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> affirmeth of the
heauenly hoſt, that they haue in heauen another head beſides
Chriſt, and therefore that the church vpon earth ought ſo to haue:
his proofe is more vncertaine, and hard to be knowen, then that he
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:7294:11"/>
ſhould ſeeke thereupon to ground any argument. But the church
in the old Teſtament had one high prieſt,<note place="margin">Argument 3.</note> therefore ſaith maſter
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> the church of Chriſt muſt haue ſo. For that church
was a figure of Chriſts church.<note place="margin">Anſwere.</note> If maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſhall goe for currant, wee muſt alſo haue but one Temple,
for they might not haue any moe, they might offer but in one place,
and many ſuch things were commaunded vnto them, vnto which
it were abſurd to tie chriſtians. Whereby we may ſee that in all
things that church was not a figure of ours. Then alſo the leuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
prieſt was a figure not of any miniſteriall head of Chriſts
church but of Chriſt himſelfe as the apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> doth
proue in ſondrie chapters.<note place="margin">Hebr. 8. 9, 10.</note> And here maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſheweth
rather a deſire to maintain his errors, then to yeld to the truth.
For without all reaſon hee affirmeth, that <hi>Aaron</hi> was not onely
a figure of Chriſt, but of <hi>Peter</hi> alſo, and his ſucceſſors, ſauing
that to auouch his vntruth, hee ſetteth downe another; namely
that the leuiticall ſacrifices, were figurs not of Chriſt onely, but
alſo of that which they call the ſacrifice of the maſſe, which how
vntrue it is I haue ſhewed elſewhere. But if it were true, that
thoſe ſacrifices were figures of both, muſt it needs follow, that
<hi>Aaron</hi> alſo muſt be the figure of Chriſt and <hi>Peter.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Aaron no figure of Peter.</note> It hath no
neceſſitie. And moreouer to anſwere both this and his fifth argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>The church was at that time contained within the bonds of
Iewry, or at the leaſt hee was but hie prieſt vnto them that were
circumciſed. As alſo in Chriſt his time the church conſiſted but of
a few perſons and therefore it cannot be neceſſarily concluded, that
if the church then was gouerned by one, when it was in a ſmall
corner of the world, it ſhould now be ſo likewiſe, when it is ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
in many places, vpon the earth. But what if I ſhould denie
to <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that this was the gouernment of the church before
Chriſt,<note place="margin">The church not ſubiect to one hie prieſt. De miſſa li. 1. c. 2</note> or that they were not at that time all vnder one hie prieſt?
For more then 2500. yeares the church was not gouerned by one
hie prieſt, which maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe doth not greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
in this place, eſpecially limiting this hie prieſt vnto that time
when there was ſome forme of gouernment eſtabliſhed amongſt
them, after they were come out of <hi>Egypt:</hi> For vntill that time as
himſelfe confeſſeth, the heads of their houſes were prieſts. And
although there were many good men at one time as <hi>Seth, Enoſh,</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:7294:11"/>
and others, yet maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> cannot ſhew, that there was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them, a hie prieſt, but euery one was chiefe in his owne
familie. But what if it appeare that then when there was a hie
prieſt, yet al Gods people were not bound to be vnder him? The
widow of <hi>Sarepta</hi> as appeareth by her ſtory,<note place="margin">1. Kin. 17.</note> had a ſure faith in
God, ſo that wee may ſay ſhee might well be accounted the child
of God. <hi>Naaman</hi> alſo the ſyrian did belong to the church of God.
And no doubt but God had many people among the Niniuites,
who repented at the preaching of <hi>Ionah.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ionah 3.</note> And yet none of theſe
were commaunded to be vnder the ſubiection of the hie prieſt.
Which thing being well cooſidered of, wee may conclude, that
if the gouernment of one ouer the whole church, were not thought
neceſſarie for any people, before ſuch time as <hi>Moyſes</hi> had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
ſuch laws to the Iſraelits from God, after they were come
out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> neither yet afterward for any but only for the Iews
as by the examples alleadged may appeare, out of this I ſay wee
may gather, that neither then was the whole church commaunded
to be vnder the gouernment of one, and alſo that it was not a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
of gouernment for the church nowe, but onely a figure of
Chriſt to them, to whome all things almoſt were deliuered in fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
and ſhadowes.<note place="margin">Arg. 4. Bellarm.</note> But maſter <hi>Bellarmines</hi> fourth argument
hath yet leſſe weight then any of the reſt. The church ſaith hee is
compared to an <hi>Armie,</hi> to <hi>Mans body,</hi> or a <hi>beutifull woman,</hi> to
a <hi>kingdome,</hi> a <hi>Sſheepfold,</hi> a <hi>houſe, Noahs arke,</hi> but no armie
without a generall, no body without a head, no wife without a
huſband, no kingdome without a king, no ſhipfold without a
ſheapheard, no houſe without a ſteward, no ſhip but hath a maſter.
We grant all this,<note place="margin">Anſwere.</note> and as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith of the head ſo
we may ſay of all theſe ſimilitudes for <hi>Chriſt</hi> can not be called a
head,<note place="margin">Praefat. in pſ. 139</note> if there be no body whereof he ſhould be head. And theſe
names are beſtowed vpon the church, and belong vnto her no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
then as we haue reſpect vnto Chriſt, that is our general,
head, huſband, king, ſheapheard, houſeholder, and ſhipmaſter.
And I cannot but muſe at the great ignorance or wilfulneſſe that
maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſheweth in this argument, who knowing the
nature of relatiues to be ſuch as that the one of them dependeth
on the other, ſo that the one cannot be without the other: &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
alſo that the wife is ſo called in reſpect of her huſband, and the
huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſo called in reſpect that he hath a wife: yet he ſhames not to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:7294:12"/>
affirme, that the church here vpon earth may well be compared to
a wife, not hauing reſpect to Chriſt her huſband. It may be his
meaning is, to rake again out of the chenel, that filthy &amp; blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
cannon,<note place="margin">De Immunit. m. 6. e Quoniam.</note> wherein the pope maketh claime to be the huſbaud
of the church, which title the ſcriptures aſcribe to Chriſt onely.
To his fifth argument and his third I anſwered together: his ſixth
argument is this.<note place="margin">Bell. arg. 6.</note> Biſhops are well ſet to haue authoritie ouer
Miniſters, Archbiſhops ouer Biſhops, therefore alſo there muſt
be one ouer all others.<note place="margin">Anſwere.</note> But this proueth not that which fame hee

(ſaith maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi>) the church muſt ſtill increaſe,<note place="margin">Bell. arg. 7.</note>
but it can not increaſe vnleſſe one man bee aboue the reſt to take

in many places? Not <hi>Peter.</hi> But they will ſay he was extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily

by the popes lawes be allowed by the pope.</p>
            <p>But to let this paſſe,<note place="margin">Ruffin. hiſt. eccl. lib. 1. cap. 9.</note>

but that one man being of authority in the church of God,

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:7294:12"/>
ſo that they may haue the commaunding of all the world. And
for their vnitie in faith,<note place="margin">Popiſh vnitie.</note> it is a kinde of vnitie, but in hypocriſie not
in veritie. Againſt Gods vndoubted word, againſt Chriſt and his

of, againſt the Lord and againſt his anointed. But can there be
no vnity in faith, but where there is ſupremacie in authoritie? Yes,
if wee marke the hiſtories wee ſhall finde, that there was neuer ſo
good conſent in ſound doctrine, as when this ſupremacie was not
hatched. A queſtion concerning circumciſion, fell among the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
in the Apoſtles time.<note place="margin">Act. 15. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> The matter was referred vnto the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles.
The Apoſtles and elders came together to looke to this
matter. After much diſputation <hi>Peter</hi> gaue his iudgement of gods
goodnes towardes the Gentiles. To that end alſo <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi>
told howe wonderfullie God had wrought among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
by them. And laſt of all <hi>Iames</hi> concluded, according to whoſe
direction the matter was defined. Now what ſupremacie was in
this counſell. The Papiſts tell vs that <hi>Peter</hi> was chiefe here, but
this is but a bold aſſertion, vow of all proofe. For firſt the wordes
doe not ſhew that <hi>Peter</hi> called them together but the contrary ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Which Saint <hi>Luke</hi> would not haue omitted, if <hi>Peter</hi> by anie
ſuperiour authoritie that he had ouer them, had called them. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeake firſt. For before he ſpake there was much
diſputation, neither did he giue definitiue ſentence in the counſell,
but Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> as doth eaſily appeare to them that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ompare the
words that he did ſpeake, with the Epiſtle that they did write, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the matter in controuerſie. So that if there were then anie
chiefe it was Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> and not Saint <hi>Peter.</hi> The like alſo I
might ſhew out of ſome other of the firſt counſels following. Of
which becauſe I ſhall haue better occaſion after to intreat, I truſt
this may ſuffice, to ſhewe that without ſupremacie, vnitie in faith
may be maintained, and therefore that the minor propoſition in this
argument is falſe. And thus haue I briefly r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ne ouer the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that are alleadged by Maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> to proue this ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne
Monarchy,<note place="margin">De Rom pontif. lib. 1. cap. 9.</note> which he ſaith muſt be in Gods church, rather
pointing to them, then proſecuting anie of them. Againſt all which
I wilt oppoſe one onelie argument, which I would deſire Maiſter
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> or ſome friend of his,<note place="margin">An argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the viſible head ouer the whole church.</note> at their good leiſure to anſwere.
No inuiſible body, can haue a viſible head, for that were a monſter
in nature. But the vniuerſall or catholike church is an inuiſible bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:7294:13"/>
for things that are vniuerſall are not ſeene with the eie, but
conceaued in the minde and vnderſtanding. Therefore the catholike
church muſt not haue a viſible head. But all this that Maiſter <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi>
hath hitherto ſpoken, of the neceſſity of hauing one ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
gouernour of the whole church, is rather an inducement, to
make men thinke that they haue ſome reaſon for this ſupremacie in
the church, then any ſtrong argument, whereby they thinke to cary
away the weight of the matter. But the very ſtrength and ſtaie of
this their doctrine is contained in this one ſyliogiſme whatſoeuer<note place="margin">The Papiſts argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie.</note>
iuriſdiction Chriſt gaue to <hi>Peter</hi> and not to the reſt of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
all that belongeth to the church of <hi>Rome:</hi> but Chriſt gaue
vnto <hi>Peter</hi> iuriſdiction, ouer the vniuerſall church and not to the
reſt of the Apoſtles: therefore the Biſhop or church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath
iuriſdiction ouer all churches, or ouer the vniuerſall church. And
in this argument is contained, not onely all that Maiſter <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>
can ſay, but all that they all can alleadge for this matter, and
therefore it is the more diligently to be examined. And to beginne
with the minor, wherein is affirmed what iuriſdiction or power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
others <hi>Peter</hi> had, Maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth confidently and
plainely affirme,<note place="margin">De pontif. Rom. lib. 1. cap 10. Whether Chriſt haue reſigned his place.</note> 
               <hi>That Saint Peter is appointed of Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,

Chriſt for the head of the church, as appeareth by his epiſtle to the

not to bee dog-driuers out of a poore pariſh church wherein

with his church now, then hee was with the people of
the Iewes, when he was conuerſant vpon the earth. For he that
promiſed that hee would be with vs alwaies,<note place="margin">Mat. 28. 25. Ioh 14. 16, 17.</note> euen vnto the end
of the world, and that hee would pray the father, and he ſhould
giue vs another comforter, which ſhould abide with vs for euer,
enen the ſpirit of truth he I ſay by the ſame ſpirit whom he hath
made his vicar generall,<note place="margin">De praeſcript. haeretie.</note> as before I aleaged out of <hi>Tertullian,</hi>
doth huſband the earth of our hearts to make them fruitfull, and
is Chriſts vicar in all places, with all perſons, to ſupply all
their wants. So that hee which in reſpect of his bodily preſence
could at no time be but in one place, by the piercing power of his
ſpirit, is at once euery where. And therefore is he much more
preſent now in the ſpirit, then before in the fleſh, becauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he could be at once but with a few of the faithfull, whereas
now he is withal at one inſtant. It is therefore ouermuch bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
in maſter <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> either to thruſt Chriſt out of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
to lay the ſame vpon <hi>Peter,</hi> or elſe to imagine that Chriſt is
not better able by his ſpirit, then by the pope, to execute the ſame.
His iudgement is alſo very hard, wherein he pronounceth that
to ſay, that ſaint <hi>Peters</hi> ſupremacy is not inſtituted by Chriſt,
it is not a ſimple errour, but a deteſtable hereſie. This I am

in maſter <hi>Bellarmines</hi> owne opinion, but in one place. For as
concerning thoſe prerogatiues which after he ſpeaketh off, they
are rather motiues to drawe vs, or probable coniectures to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
vs, then ſtrong argumentes to prooue, or ſufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
to conuince and force vs to beleeue. I ſaie they haue but
one authority of Scripture that they reſt vpon, becauſe that place
out of the ſixteenth of Saint <hi>Matthewes</hi> goſpel,<note place="margin">De pontif. Rom. li. 1. cap. 12.</note> is but a promiſe
as maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe confeſſeth, of that which was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes
giuen, when Chriſt commaunded him to feede his
ſheepe, ſo that one is not perfect without the other. But let
vs ſee what iuriſdiction is promiſed in the one, and then alſo
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:7294:14"/>
what is giuen in the other vnto <hi>Peter.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 16. 13.</note> Our Sauiour Chriſt
inquiring of his diſciples what opinion other men had of him,
they anſwered, ſome ſaie that thou art <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſt, ſome <hi>Elias,</hi>
ſome <hi>Ieremias,</hi> or one of the Prophetes, and aſking of them
what they thought of him, Simon <hi>Peter</hi> anſwered thou art
Chriſt the ſonne of the liuing God. And Ieſus anſwered and
ſaide vnto him, happie art thou Simon the ſonne of <hi>Iona,</hi> for
fleſh and bloud hath not opened that vnto thee, but my father
which is in heauen. And I ſay alſo vnto thee that thou art <hi>Peter,</hi>
and vpon this rocke I will build my church, and the gates of hell
ſhall not preuaile againſt it. And I will giue vnto thee the
keies of the kingdome of heauen, and whatſoeuer thou ſhalt bind
in earth, ſhall be bound in heauen, and whatſoeuer thou ſhalt
looſe in earth, ſhall bee looſed in heauen. Theſe are the wordes
that muſt ſtrengthen and ſtay this ſtately building of the popes
ſupremacie, or elſe it is like to fall. Out of which maſter <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi>
draweth two argumentes. Firſt that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> is
the foundation, ſecondly that hee is the key carier of the church,
and therefore that hee muſt bee the ſupreme head of the church.
The firſt is taken out of theſe wordes, <hi>Thou art Peter and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this rocke I will build my church.</hi> The plaine meaning of
which words I take to be this. When firſt I tooke thee to be an
Apoſtle, I ſaid thou ſhouldeſt bee called <hi>Cephas</hi> which is by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
a ſtone.<note place="margin">Iohn. 1. 42.</note> Thou ſhalt ſhew thy ſelfe ſo to be indeede,
and that I haue named thee ſo truly, for in this confeſſion that
thou haſt made of me thou ſhalt hereafter continue ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtant that
thou ſhalt die in it. And therefore becauſe thou ſhalt bee ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
thou art <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Cephas</hi> indeede. As for this confeſſion
that thou haſt made, all my faithfull people ſhall ſettle and ſtaie
themſelues thereupon, in all conflictes of conſcience, ſo that no
terrour of hell ſhall bee able to diſcourage or diſamaie
them.</p>
            <p>But maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> out of this doth gather that the church
is built vpon <hi>Peter,</hi> as vpon a foundation. Yet I truſt hee will
not deny, that Chriſt is ſuch a foundation, as there is no other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<hi>S. Paul</hi> telleth vs,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3. 11.</note> that other foundation can no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lay, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

that the prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſpeaketh eſpecially of Chriſt, and then to
apply it vnto the church of Rome. For ſeeing the ſcriptures
with ſo great conſent, do acknowlege Chriſt to be that tried and

ſtone, becauſe he hath made of Iew and Gentile one, breaking

is a thing that not one but Chriſt can performe, let vs knowe,
that to giue this title to any other, is to rob Chriſt of his glory.
And yet as though maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> had not powred out al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready

abſurdly he hath begun,<note place="margin">Bellarmines blaſphemies, Eſay 8. 14. Matt. 21. 44.</note> adding, that this their Romiſh church
is the ſtone of offence, and ſtumbling blocke, vpon which ſtone
he that falleth ſhall be broken, but on whomſoeuer it ſhall fall, it
ſhall grinde him to powder. But howſoeuer it pleaſeth maſter
<hi>Bellarmine,</hi> to bragge of the might and maieſty of the church of
Rome, we ſee that the hath loſt many kingdomes, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time

               </gap>ayly from her: and that ſuch as doe ſo, haue no
cauſe to repent it, but that God aideth them with his wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and mercifull hand, and proſecuteth them with many bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings.</p>
            <p>But to returne vnto maſter <hi>Bellarmines</hi> argument againe:
Vpon this rocke I will build my church. The foundation of a
houſe hath two reſpects: Firſt, it holdeth vp the whole build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which being coupled together in it, groweth to be an houſe,
as before I haue ſhewed out of ſaint <hi>Paules</hi> epiſtle to the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi>
and thus Chriſt onely is the foundation of his church,
as hee is alſo the head, whereof all the bodie furniſhed and knit
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:7294:16"/>
together with ioints and bands, increaſeth with the increaſing
of God.<note place="margin">Coloſs. 2. 19.</note> This foundation or head none can be but Chriſt.
Secondly the fonndation is as it were a direction and rule,
for the building of the reſt of the houſe. For it muſt be made, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the length and breadth of the foundation. In which
reſpect the Apoſtles are called foundations in the reuelation,
foundations I ſay in this church of God.<note place="margin">Apocal. 21. 14. Epheſ. 2. 20.</note> And ſo doth the apoſtle
ſay that the church is built vpon the fonndation of the Apoſtles
and prophets, Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe beeing the chiefe corner
ſtone.<note place="margin">How the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles are founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> And whether they be called foundations in reſpect of
their doctrine as Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> thinketh, or becauſe they
were firſt layed in the building, as <hi>Theophilact</hi> ſeemeth to
affirme:<note place="margin">Amb. on theſe words Epheſ. 2. Theoph. Eph. 2.</note> yet are they not ſuch foundations as can hold vp this
building: but ſuch onely as by their doctrine and fayth, muſt
be a patterne and platforme, for all other builders to builde by,
that they goe not out of that rule and ſquare, which is moſt
fit for Gods houſe. And thus we confeſſe that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> is
a foundation as alſo all the Apoſtles are.<note place="margin">Chryſoſt. in Eph. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> 6.</note> And that which
<hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> writeth vpon this place, is in my iudgement
a ſtrong argument, againſt this ſecondarie foundation, which
they ſay <hi>Peter</hi> is, becauſe he will haue the building ſo coupled
wit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e foundation, as that there ſhalbe nothing between them.
But moſt plainely in his commentaries vpon the epiſtle to the
<hi>Corinthians</hi> he will haue nothing betweene vs and Chriſt, no
diſtance betweene the head and the bodie.<note place="margin">Hom. 8.</note> As he proueth by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of the head and the bodie, the branch and the tree, the
building and the foundation. For if the head be from the body,
but the thickneſſe of a ſword it dieth. If the branch be cut from
the tree, neuer ſo litle, it withereth. If the houſe be not ioyned
vpon the foundation, it falleth. Howe then can we haue any
ſecondary foundation in the church of God, without the ruine of
the whole church.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtles therefore may well bee foundations (as I
haue before ſaide, either becauſe that they are (as it were) the
firſt ſtones that are layed, vpon Chriſt, in this building, or
becauſe of their doctrine whereupon our faith is grounded, but
otherwiſe, we can not admitte them all, or any one of them,
whether <hi>Peter,</hi> or any other, to be a foundation, in this building.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7294:16"/>
So that al the paines that maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> taketh, to proue,
that <hi>this rocke</hi> muſt needs ſignifie <hi>Peter</hi> himſelfe, is more than
needeth: for we wil confeſſe, that he and the reſt of the Apoſtles,
are foundations in the church. But if after ſome more peculiar
ſort, he wil haue him a foundation, neither hath he prooued it by
that which he vrgeth out theſe words, vpon <hi>this rocke,</hi> neither
yet by that vniuerſall conſent of the church that he braggeth of.
For the fathers do in ſundry ſorts expound theſe words, ſom by
this rocke vnderſtand <hi>Peter</hi> as he was an apoſtle, and teacher
of the word of God. And ſo may the fathers be vnderſtoode
that are in this chapter alleaged by maſter <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> For he
can not reaſon thus: He is called a foundation, therefore he is
a foundation after ſome other manner than the other Apoſtles.
Some by this rocke vnderſtand Chriſt whom <hi>Peter</hi> confeſſed.
So doth ſaint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In Ioh Tract. 124. &amp; Retract. lib. 1. cap. 21.</note> vpon this rocke which thou haſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
(ſaith he) I will build my church: now the rocke that hee
confeſſed was Chriſt. There are alſo ſundry that by this rocke
vnderſtand the confeſſion that <hi>Peter</hi> made, as <hi>Hillarie, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe,
Chryſoſtome</hi> and <hi>Cyril.</hi> But none of theſe interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
can pleaſe our Romiſh rabbies, but that only that makes
<hi>Peter</hi> the foundation in Chriſts place, which can not out of any
of theſe expoſitions be gathered. S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> maſter <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>
ſaith, was deceiued, becauſe he knew not the Hebrew
tongue: but yet ſaint <hi>Auguſtines</hi> words teach vs, that in his
time this place was not by conſent of the godly, ſo expounded as
now the Papiſts expound it, but only that there were ſundry ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
of ſundry men: and that ſaint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> liked this of
his beſt. How happeneth it then that maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> with
a great cracke ſaieth hee hath the conſent of the whole church?
Where is their catholike doctrine euen in this point, that which
now the church of Rome teacheth, was not in ſaint <hi>Auguſtines</hi>
dayes catholike. But to to proue this doctrine to be catholike,
he ſaith,<note place="margin">De pontif. Rom. lib. 1. cap. 10 De locis Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>log. lib. 6. The Papiſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the Chalce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don councell.</note>

in the words alleadged by maſter <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> ſpeaketh alſo of

and ſpeaking of this rocke, he would that euerie one ſhould haue

ſaid for <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> and <hi>Cirill,</hi> but this I truſt is ſufficient to
ſhew the vanity of his anſwere, which is ſo flatte againſt the
words of thoſe fathers. For they ſpeake of that faith, becauſe
it hath reſpect vnto Chriſt, and maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would haue
it imagined that they commend this faith as it commeth from

ſheweth no plaine dealing. For whereas <hi>Hillary</hi> ſaith after,
by the confeſſion of his happie faith, hee deſerued a high place,
or rather as the older copies doe read exceeding glorie, maſter
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth not only out of this doubtfull reading gather
the ſtrength of his argument, preferring the new reading before
the olde coppie, in that paint diſclaiming from antiquity; but
alſo to better his bad cauſe, whereas <hi>Hillary</hi> himſelfe ſheweth
in plaine wordes, that this exceeding glorie is this, that he thriſe
heard theſe wordes, feede my ſheepe, yet hee woulde make vs
beleeue, that it conſiſteth in this that <hi>Peter</hi> is the head, founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:7294:17"/>
ſtiflie bee maintained, and yet cannot bee defended, but by lying
and falſifying.</p>
            <p>And thus hauing anſwered, the moſt forcible proofes that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> bringeth, to proue that the church muſt bee built
vpon <hi>Peter:</hi> I would on the other ſide wiſh him to conſider how
weake a foundation he and his fellowes doe builde vpon. For
<hi>Peter</hi> did not only by euill councell,<note place="margin">The weakenes of Peter to be a foundation. Matth. 16. 23.</note> ſeeke to hinder his maſter
Chriſt in the worke of our redemption, for which hee was bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
reprooued, go behinde me Sathan, thou art (ſaith Chriſt)
an offence vnto me, becauſe thou vnderſtandeſt not the thinges
that are of God, but the thinges that are of men, but alſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes
denie his maſter Chriſt,<note place="margin">Matth. 26. 74.</note> and that with curſing and
ſwearing: but hauing receiued the ſpirit of God, and beeing
inabled as much as euer he was, to the worke of the Lord, yet
by <hi>Peters</hi> fault, <hi>Barnabas</hi> and other were brought into diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation,
ſo that they walked not the right waie,<note place="margin">Gal. 2. 13, 14.</note> to the truth
of the goſpell. And therefore he was withſtood euen to his face
by <hi>Paule,</hi> becauſe hee was worthie to bee blamed. So that
euen then, if there had beene no better or ſurer foundation, to
haue builded the church vpon then <hi>Peter,</hi> the building might
well haue runne to one ſide. But thankes bee vnto God that
we haue a ſurer rocke.<note place="margin">Peter not the foundation.</note> But what will he and his fellowes ſaie,
to that moſt groſſe abſurditie that followeth this their doctrine?
For if <hi>Peter</hi> be the foundation of the church, what anſwere will
they make to them, that thinke the time was when the church
was only in the virgin Mary? Vpon what foundation was the
church then builded? Yea what foundation of the church was,
before <hi>Peter</hi> was borne or thought of in the time of the law? Yea
what foundation in all the time before the lawe, when there was
not ſo much as a high prieſt among the people. Then was
there a church as all men confeſſe, and therefore it muſt needes
alſo then haue a foundation, but it could not be <hi>Peter.</hi> For hee
had theſe wordes ſpoken vnto him almoſt 4000. yeares after the
church began. And could it ſtand and floriſh ſo manie yeares,
builded only vpon Chriſt the ſure foundation, and ſhall
we nowe thinke that this foundation beginneth to ſhrinke, or
is leſſe able to vphold this building, ſo that it muſt needes haue
Saint <hi>Peter</hi> to helpe to holde it vppe, for feare of falling?
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:7294:18"/>
God forbid that euer chriſtians ſhould haue ſo fooliſh thoughts,
and yet theſe and ſuch like abſurdities muſt folow this doctrine.
But to conclude this point I reaſon thus.<note place="margin">That is now that alwaies was the foundation.</note> That only muſt be the
foundation of the church now, which was in the time of the lawe
and before the law, but then there was no other foundation but
Chriſt, therefore now there muſt be no other. I meane no other
eſpecial or particular foundation. My maior or firſt propoſition
is grounded vpon Maiſter <hi>Bellarmines</hi> wordes.<note place="margin">De Pontif. Rom. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

or the ſame citty of God.</p>
            <p>Now thus I reaſon for proofe of my maior. If the not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
of that outward forme of gouernement can make that it is
not the ſame church, how much more if any thing be added to the

doth make it to be not the ſame church, therfore much
more if it be altered in the foundation. And to ſaie that the church
now in the time of grace is not all one with that church that was
before Chriſt, or that then there was anie other foundation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
Chriſt, is nothing els then to deny Chriſt to be a corner
ſtone, that ioyneth together both ſides of the houſe, making of
both one. By which the minor of my argument is verified. Thus
I truſt to the indifferent reader it may appeare, that as this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
of theſe wordes vpon this rocke I will builde my
church, that is vpon <hi>Peter,</hi> is not catholike, ſo the doctrine that
followeth therupon is abſurd. Let vs now conſider what weight
there is in his ſecond argument whith hee wringeth out of the
word of building.<note place="margin">De Pontif. Rom. lib. 1. cap. 11. Bellar. his 2. Arg. to build is to rule.</note> Wherein he affirmeth, (and in truth doth but
affirme, for he can proue nothing at all) that to builde is to rule.
Indeede he alleadgeth three fathers which ſay <hi>Peter</hi> was Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor
of the church, or ruled all the church, but is this a good argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>Peter</hi> did rule the whole church,<note place="margin">Anſwere.</note> therefore to builde is to
rule? Such a ſhew of proofe, may perchance ſeeme glorious in
the eies of them that haue no loue to the truth, but they are too
too fooliſh that will be caught with ſuch baites. That to build is
not to rule I proue thus.</p>
            <p>A man buildeth to haue a houſe, that he may rule, and he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:7294:18"/>
rule, but that firſt the houſe muſt be made. So that indeede
building in the houſe ceaſeth, when ruling beginneth, when the
houſe is made, then is it ruled. With much like dexterity he will
proue that the foundation doth rule the houſe. In the ende if you
will heare him, he will make you beleeue, that the houſe ruleth
the maiſter, not the maiſter the houſe. But let vs grant Maiſter
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> this which ſo earneſtly he ſeeketh for. Let vs yeelde
that to builde is to rule, what is then out of theſe wordes to be
gathered? Vpon this rocke I will build, that is I will rule my
church. This we ſee, Chriſt is the ruler (and not <hi>Peter</hi>) of the
church. Then let vs go forwarde, that we may ſee what help vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this popiſh ſupremacy, the wordes following do bring: vnto
thee will I giue (ſaith Chriſt) the keies of the kingdome of heauen
&amp;c. Here Maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is very earneſt to proue, that theſe

we diſſent? Forſooth Maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> telleth vs that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

And that it muſt ſo be he proueth thus. In the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi>
is deſcribed the depoſing of one high prieſt, and placing of an
other by the deliuering of the keies. And the keies of the houſe
of <hi>Dauid</hi> will I lay vpon his ſhoulder, and hee ſhall open and

dealing would become all men, eſpecially in Gods cauſe,
which is farre from maiſter <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> as in many other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
ſo heere alſo. For <hi>Eliachim</hi> of whom the promiſe was
made in this place,<note place="margin">2. Chron. 31. 10.</note> was not hie prieſt. Indeede <hi>Azariah</hi> was
high prieſt in the dayes of <hi>Ezechiah.</hi> Neither yet was there e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
any ſuch high prieſt as <hi>Shebnah,</hi> whome God threateneth
in that place. Whoſoeuer marketh either the pedigree of prieſts
in the ſcriptures, or in <hi>Ioſephus,</hi> hee ſhall finde it to bee moſt
falſe and vntrue, that heere maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſo boldly affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth.</p>
            <p>But this <hi>Eliachim</hi> was one of the princes whome <hi>Ezechiah,</hi>
ſent to <hi>Rabſache,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Kings 18. 18.</note> whome in that place the Septuagint do call

to be one that was <hi>ouer the houſe,</hi> as alſo Saint <hi>Hierome</hi>

frends (as it may alſo appeare in that he ſent him to <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſache</hi>)
and his lieutenant or vicegerent, or doer for him, let the

and the credulitie of his frends, who hee hopeth wil not examine
that he writeth, whether it haue weight or not, but will take all
for gold, that hee giueth, if it looke yelow. Thus againſt all
truth to affirme <hi>Eliachim</hi> to be hie prieſt is too bad. And to offer
by ſuch proofe as could not but be vncertain euen to himſelfe, to
proue ſo waighty a matter, whereupon ſo great controuerſie in
religion hangeth, doth not onely proclaime that all may heare
it, the weakneſſe of his cauſe, but alſo that his indeuour is, to
keepe vnder the truth, that it appeare not. And thus much to
lay open his falſhood in his firſt reaſon: Now let vs ſee the
weakeneſſe of his ſecond.</p>
            <p>To binde and looſe (ſaieth hee) is to commaunde,<note place="margin">Bellarm. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

puniſh, and to diſpence, and to remitte. But <hi>Peter</hi> coulde
binde and looſe. What nowe will Maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude.
Therefore (ſaith hee) hee is iudge and prince of all that
are in the church, we will not much ſtand with him in his maior,
although it might haue beene vttered in plainer termes.<note place="margin">Anſwere.</note> For
this authoritie of binding and looſing is ſo committed vnto the
church, that the power to do it, is tied not to the man but to the
miniſterie, not to the materiall church, but to the word. And
therefore wee cannot ſimply ſay that to bind and looſe, is to
commaund or puniſh, but to commaund according to the word,
and to puniſh according to the direction of it. For wee muſt not
imagine, that God muſt be the executioner of our owne decrees,
or tyed to allowe of our iudgements, but that wee are the
proclaimers of his iudgements, and muſt pronounce what God
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:7294:20"/>
in his reueiled word hath already ſet downe. And alſo the word
of diſpenſing, though it may perchaunce haue a good vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
as if thereby we meane the meane the ordering and beſtowing of
the word,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 4. 1.</note> in reſpect whereof, the miniſters are called ſtewards or
diſpoſers of the ſecrets of God: ſo muſt we take heede, that
thereby we giue not to any man, ſaint <hi>Peter</hi> or any other, liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to diſpenſe at their pleaſure, and to order as they will the
people of God. For as magiſtrates if they do not gouerne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to law, abuſe their authoritie and doe degenerate into
tyrants: ſo miniſters of the word, if they ſwarue from the word,
are but ſeducers. The maior I ſay beeing rightly vnderſtood
wee doe yeld vnto, and the minor is alſo true, that <hi>Peter</hi> could
binde and looſe. But maſter <hi>Bellarmines</hi> concluſion doth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
with theſe propoſitions neither can it folow, if they be
graunted.<note place="margin">Daniel 2.</note> It hangeth no better together then <hi>Daniels</hi> image
of ſundrie mettalles, that could not long hold together. But
this muſt be maſter <hi>Bellarmines</hi> concluſion to bind and looſe, is
to commannd, puniſh, diſpenſe, and remit, in ſuch ſort as I
haue alreadie ſhewed, but ſaint <hi>Peter</hi> could binde and looſe,
therefore ſaint <hi>Peter</hi> might commaund, puniſh, diſpenſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
as hath beene ſhewed. This muſt be maſter <hi>Bellarmines</hi>
concluſion, but this will not ſerue maſter <hi>Bellarmines</hi> turne:
For euery miniſter ſhould ſo doe, and not <hi>Peter</hi> onely. And
all this is doone by the miniſtery of the word in euery paſtours
ſeuerall charge, if the miniſter be faithfull in his office. Seeing
his ſecond argument concludeth nothing againſt vs, what doth
his third and laſt argument?<note place="margin">Bellarm. 3. argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment out of the Fathers.</note> He promiſeth by the fathers to
proue, that theſe keis are a ſoueraigne and chiefe authoritie ouer
the whole church. What, will he bring vs a catholike erpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
receaued by all or moſt of the godly learned, at all times, in
all places, agreed vpon with one conſent? For otherwiſe it is
not catholike. No. But hee telleth vs of two of the fathers
onely. And the one of them being himſelfe a pope, and in ſuch
times as that before his dayes this ſuperioritie ouer all, had
bin ſundrie wayes ſought for by the Biſhop of Rome: his
credit is in this point not much worth againſt vs.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Chriſoſtom</hi> who is the other witnes that muſt prooue
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:7294:21"/>
that by the keies Chriſt meaneth this vinuerſal iuriſdiction:<note place="margin">Chryſoſtome examined. In Mat, hom. 55.</note> Firſt
he reaſoneth in that very place where theſe words are, againſt
the Arrians or ſome ſuch heretikes, as made Chriſt not equall
to the father, aud inſulteth againſt them by occaſion of this place.
The father (ſaith hee) gaue vnto <hi>Peter</hi> the reuelation of the
ſonne. But the ſonne gaue vnto him partly that hee might
ſowe through the whole earth, this reuelation both of the father
and of the ſonne: partly that he being a mortall man, ſhould be
indued with heauenly power, and haue the keis of the kingdome
of heauen. And it foloweth there in <hi>Chriſoſtom,</hi> how then is he
leſſe, that wrought this in <hi>Peter?</hi> So then to proue Chriſt to
be equall vnto the father in power, he ſheweth that he wrought,
if not more mightely, yet as powerfull in <hi>Peter</hi> as the father
did.</p>
            <p>And vpon this occaſion he thus amplifieth this excellency of
<hi>Peter,</hi> as alſo he doth a litle before in reſpect of that vniuerſall
church that Chriſt committed to him, which charge the reſt alſo
had. For all the apoſtles were generall Preachers, whereſoeuer
God called them.<note place="margin">Ibidem,</note> And therefore <hi>Chriſoſtom</hi> doth ſay of them
all, not of <hi>Peter</hi> only, that they were the teachers of the world.
And in another place that there were two paires of the apoſtles
that held this headſhip.<note place="margin">In Matt. hom. 38</note> And yet <hi>Peter</hi> might better then any of
the reſt, be called the paſtour or head of the church, that were of
the twelue, becauſe the charge of the Iewes whereſoeuer they
were in any place, were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to him without any limitation
of nation or countrie wherein they liued. Seeing therefore his
proofes whereby he indeuoureth to proue theſe keis to ſignifie
that vniuerſall and ſoueraigne authoritie ouer the whole church,
are either ſo falſe or faultie that they are not worth alleaging, as
are his two reaſons taken out of ſcripture, or ſo feeble that they
can haue no ſtrength, as this out of <hi>Chriſoſtome:</hi> I ſee no
reaſon why we ſhould yeld either to ſcripturs, ſo falſly or fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
applyed, or much leſſe to the ſayings of men, ſo hardly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued.</p>
            <p>For as before I haue admoniſhed, it is one thing to haue an
excellency or ſuperioritie among others in ſome reſpects of other
mens yeldings: another thing to haue iuriſdiction, of his owne
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:7294:21"/>
right and intereſt, ouer all other. The firſt we confeſſe was in
<hi>Peter,</hi> but that wil nothing at all helpe the Pope, or the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction
of the church of Rome.<note place="margin">An argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts.</note> Againſt the interpretation of the
popiſh church thus I reaſon. If theſe keis belong to all them,
that haue ovtained that grace of God, to be called to the functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a biſhop, (I ſpeake not of the hononr, but of the office) then
is no chiefe authoritie ſignifieth thereby, (for where many are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
there is no man chiefe) But theſe keies belong vnto all
ſuch as <hi>Theaphilact</hi> doth teſtifie,<note place="margin">Theoph, in Mat. 16.</note> therefore no ſuch chiefe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
is ſignified thereby. For my minor propoſition that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
biſhop or paſtour hath ſuch authoritie, or ſuch keis, beſides
the teſtimonie of <hi>Theophilact,</hi> we haue moſt plaine proofe out
of Gods word.<note place="margin">Mat. 16. 18. An argument to proue my minor. Iohn 20, 23.</note> Whatſoeuer is promiſed <hi>Mathew</hi> the ſixteenth
chapter in theſe words, I will giue thee the keis, is performed
<hi>Iohn</hi> the twentieth chapter, in theſe words, whoſe ſinnes ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
they are remitted, and whoſe ſinnes ye retaine they are retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
but in Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> no chiefe power is giuen, but ſuch as is
generall and common to all the apoſtles, therefore in Saint
<hi>Mathew</hi> there is not promiſed any chiefe power, but ſuch as is
common to them all,<note place="margin">De Pontif. Rom, lib. 1. cap. 12. 13.</note> and ſo to all paſtours in them. My minor
needeth no proofe for it is confeſſed by maſter <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> But
maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> denieth my maior,<note place="margin">A reply againſt Bellarmines an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ior,</note> and yet hath no ground
of his deniall, but this onely, that he taketh it not be all one to
binde and to retaine ſinnes or ſinners, and to looſe or remit.
Which ſubtil difference the fathers did not ſee. And therefore
<hi>Theophilact</hi> doth not onely expound this place of <hi>Matthew</hi>
the ſixteenth chapter by that place out of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
chapter, making this later to bee a perfourmance of that
promiſe, I will giue thee the keies, but alſo hee flattely there
oppoſeth remitting to binding, whereas by maſter <hi>Bellarmines</hi>
doctrine, if hee had beene brought vp in his ſchoole, he ſhould
haue ſet remitting againſt retaining,<note place="margin">Bellarm. cap. 12 &amp; 13. lib. 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

For (ſaith hee) it is a greater matter to binde, then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
to looſe then to remit. Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> alſo maketh to
binde and to retaine, to remitte, and to looſe all one. For,
whileſt the puritie of doctrine in ſome meaſure remayned,
this ſubtile Sophiſtirie was vnknowen in Gods church. But

nowe for defence of popery, ſuch ſtuffe muſt ſerue the turne,
when they haue no better. And heere I cannot but maruell at
maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> his anſwere vnto this argument out of the
centuries.<note place="margin">Cent. 2. lib. 1. ca. 7. col. 526. The argument out of the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies againſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>premacie.</note> For they that wrote thoſe bookes reaſon thus, if in
theſe wordes, to thee will I giue the keies &amp;c. there were promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
any ſupremacie, the Apoſtlles could not haue doubted which
of them ſhould haue beene chiefe, but they doubted of this, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there was not in thoſe wordes any ſuch ſupremacie promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.<note place="margin">Bellarmines an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere co it exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</note>
Maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> maketh no queſtion but that they
doubted of it, for there was among them ſome contention a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
that matter, but for the maior hee anſwereth, that the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
did not vnderſtande plainelie that there was anie promiſe
made to <hi>Peter,</hi> vntill after that Chriſt roſe againe, but then they
ſuſpected ſome ſuch matter and that made them ſtriue. Is it
not great boldnes in maſter <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> in ſo waightie matters,
to bring no other warrant but his fooliſh fancie? Or to anſwere
ſuch an vnanſwerable argument, by ſuch ſilly ſhiftes? They
knewe not ſaith maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> that Chriſt made ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
to <hi>Peter</hi> vntill after Chriſt was riſen againe. But if it
had beene an article of ſuch importance as now it is made, why
ſhoulde they not haue knowne it? They heard what Chriſt ſaid
to <hi>Peter,</hi> they heard the promiſe of the keies, and this is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as our Romiſh Rabbines can nowe bring for their proofe.
If they vnderſtoode it not ſo, as maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> heere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth
they did not, what newe reuelation haue our newe Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh
teachers, to aſſure this to be the meaning of thoſe wordes?
But they ſeeme to be whelpes of one haire, with thoſe hereticks
whome <hi>Tertullian</hi> reprooueth,<note place="margin">De preſcription, aduerlus haerer. Heretickes and Papiſtes charge thopoſtles with ignorance. Artic. 18.</note> becauſe they ſaide the apoſtles
knewe not all thinges, that if their doctrine were not agreeable
to that which the Apoſtles taught, they might the leſſe bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.
As Biſhoppe <hi>Fiſher,</hi> not knowing better howe to
excuſe their additions vnto the auncient doctrine,<note place="margin">Againſt Luther.</note> which the
church of Rome hath brought in, ſaith that later wits knowe
thinges better then before they did.</p>
            <p>Well, maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> you ſee confeſſeth, that the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
vnderſtoode not then, that promiſe as nowe the papiſtles
doe. When did they reforme their iudgement? Where, in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:7294:22"/>
what place doe they ſhew any ſignification, that they euer vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
it otherwiſe? If they neither vnderſtood it ſo before Chriſts
reſurrection, neither yet gaue anie ſignification afterwardes,
by woorde or deede, by their writings or examples, that
their knowledge was in this pointe reformed, howe can wee
ſaie, that they euer tooke that to bee Chriſtes meaning? But
the firſt of theſe is confeſſed (as before is ſhewed) by Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<hi>Bellarmine,</hi> the latter they cannot ſhewe. Therefore
it maie be gathered that the apoſtles neuer vnderſtood the words
of Chriſt as the papiſtes doe.<note place="margin">Thapoſtles ſtroue not for ſuprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie after Chriſtes reſurrection.</note> And howe doeth hee prooue that
which hee boldlie affirmeth, that then they ſuſpected ſuch a
thing? Or that after Chriſtes reſurrection they did ſtriue. It
is mentioned in the ſtorie of the goſpell,<note place="margin">Matth. 18. 1. Mark. 9. 34. Luke. 9. 46. Luk. 22. 24. Iohn. 13. 13. Matth. 20. 24. Mark. 10. 41.</note> that twiſe they did
ſtriue who ſhoulde be chiefe.</p>
            <p>Of both which times the three Euangeliſtes doe make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.
And Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> alſo in his goſpell, ſeemeth to pointe
vnto the latter ſtrife, when hauing waſhed his Apoſtles feete,
Chriſt giueth them good leſſons of humilitie. But that after
Chriſtes reſurrection they did conſende for this, it cannot bee
prooued. For both theſe times were before his death. And
therefore I cannot but maruell, that Maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> will
bring ſuch proofeleſſe ſtuffe to open light, as though hee ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined,
that his counterfaite coyne, muſt goe for currant.
And whereas afterwardes hee alleadgeth out of <hi>Origen,
Chryſoſtóme</hi> and <hi>Hierome,</hi> that the apoſtles did ſtriue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
themſelues, becauſe they ſuſpected this ſupremacie of
<hi>Peter,</hi> himſelfe doeth not in this, giue credite to theſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>For if it bee true that maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaide before, that
this ſuſpition was not vntill Chriſt was riſen, then howe is
this true that they affirme that they ſuſpected thus much, when
they did ſtriue firſt of all. Which was at the leaſt about a yeare
and a halfe, before Chriſt roſe againe. Neither doe theſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
heerein deſerue to bee beleeued.<note place="margin">Matth. 17. 12.</note> For the grounde of
this their conceite, is that they imagined the paying of the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
money to haue beene before this contention. For they
ſurmiſe that becauſe Chriſt ſaid paie for mee and thee, therefore
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:7294:23"/>
the reſt of the apoſtles, ſuſpected that <hi>Peter</hi> ſhoulde haue ſome
ſuperiority ouer them, and grudged at it. But this their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,
as it is farre from the thought of the apoſtles (for any
thing that may be gathered) ſo is it flatly confuted by the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
For this contention was before the tribute money was
demaunded, namely, in the way before they came to <hi>Caper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naum,</hi>
as is moſt plaine in the euangeliſt ſaint <hi>Markes</hi> goſpel,
the ninth chapter, and three and thirtie and foure and thirtie ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
And the tribute was not demaunded before they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into <hi>Capernaum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">They contended not becauſe they ſuſpected Peters ſupremacie.</note> and into a houſe there, <hi>Matthew</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenteenth
chapter and xxv. verſe. Therefore that ſuſpition of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie
was not the cauſe of their contention, which maiſter
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> woulde prooue out of theſe fathers. But perchance
rather that ambitious affection that was in <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> the
ſonnes of <hi>Zebedee,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 10. 37.</note> which afterwardes they ſhewed more
plainely,<note place="margin">41</note> in aſking that one might ſit at his right hand, and
the other on his left hand, was cauſe of their ſtrife. And indeed
the euangeliſt concerning this ſaith, that the other tenne diſdai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
at them for it. But the other contention that was among
the apoſtles is not ſaide to be againſt <hi>Peter,</hi> as this is ſaid to be
againſt <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn.</hi> But it ſeemeth that euery one would
be aboue other, and no ſuſpition then, that <hi>Peter</hi> ſhoulde be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
all.</p>
            <p>And whereas they that wrote thoſe Bookes called the
Centuries, alleadge, that if there had beene in <hi>Peter</hi> any ſuch
Supremacy, Chriſt woulde haue ſaide to them when they did
ſtriue, contend no more, for I haue made <hi>Peter</hi> chiefe amongſt
you: but (ſay they) hee ſpake no ſuch wordes: Now maſter
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> will prooue, that Chriſt tolde them, that <hi>Peter</hi>
was appointed to bee chiefe.<note place="margin">Luk. 22. 26. Bellar, argument to prooue Chriſt to haue told Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he ſhould be chiefe.</note> And howe? He that is greateſt
among you (ſaieth Chriſt) let him bee as the leaſt, and the
chiefe as he that ſerueth. Therefore (ſaieth Maiſter <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>)
it is plaine, that one is called chiefe. If hee had
meant that the trueth ſhould appeare, hee woulde, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
this place with others where the ſame thing or ſtorie is
reported, haue ſette downe the true meaning of the wordes,
and not take aduantage, to peruert the true meaning, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:7294:23"/>
the ſimple Reader. For <hi>Matthew</hi> in his twentieth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and twentie ſixe and twentie ſeuen verſes, and <hi>Marke</hi> in his
tenth chapter, and fortie three and fortie foure verſes reporting
this ſtorie, doe plainely teach, that Chriſt doeth not ſpeake of
any chiefeneſſe that was among them, but that they woulde
haue, or deſired. For they ſay not, if any be, but if any would
be chiefe, ſo reproouing their ambitious affection, and teacheth
them rather to indeuour to be humble.<note place="margin">In Math. how, 66</note> Becauſe, as <hi>Chroyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome</hi>
ſaieth, hee that ſeeketh Supremacie ſhameth himſelfe.
And therefore neuer any I ſuppoſe before Maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
out of theſe wordes of Chriſt, hath gathered this proclaiming
of <hi>Peters</hi> ſuperioritie.</p>
            <p>Hitherto wee haue ſeene, howe little hee can prooue by the
firſt of his two places of ſcripture. Now let vs trie what weight
the other teſtimonie hath.<note place="margin">Bellann. depon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tif. Ro. li 3. c. 34. Iohn 21.</note> And this is drawen alſo out of the
wordes of our ſauiour Chriſt to <hi>Peter,</hi> who when he had thrice
aſked of him,<note place="margin">Bellarm, 2. argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment our of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture anſwered.</note> whether hee loued Chriſt, and ſtil he anſwered,
that hee did loue him, hee willeth him to feede his ſheepe.
Now theſe wordes (ſaieth maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi>) are ſpoken to
<hi>Peter</hi> onely.<note place="margin">Anſwere.</note> It is true. But that Leſſon is not giuen to
<hi>Peter</hi> onely. For, to all the apoſtles it belongeth, to feede
Chriſts ſheepe,<note place="margin">Li, 1, cap. 12.</note> and therefore are all Paſtours and Sheepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards.</p>
            <p>Yea, it is confeſſed by maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere
to an authoritie alleadged out of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> that all the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
were like in apoſtolike power, and had euen the ſame
authoritie ouer chriſtian people. If they had the ſelfe ſame au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
ouer chriſtians that <hi>Peter</hi> had, which here he confeſſeth,
then to the reſt as well as to <hi>Peter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">De paſtorib u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> cap. 13.</note> was this charge of feeding
Chriſts ſheepe committed. And therefore Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi>
will haue Chriſt to be the onely good ſheepheard, and that all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are good in him, and are equall in this their worke, for he
maketh no difference. But Chriſt feedeth, they alſo feede, yea
enen when they feede hee feedeth, and Chriſt ſaith that then he
feedeth in them, becauſe his voice is in them, and his loue is in
them.</p>
            <p>But what ſhould I ſtand vpon this point? It is more plaine,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:7294:24"/>
then that maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe can deny it, although he
would blinde the eies of the ſimple with this diſtinction,<note place="margin">The charge of feeding belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to all alike.</note> that it
is principallie ſpoken to <hi>Peter,</hi> but in ſome ſort to all. What,
was <hi>Peter</hi> bound to feede more diligently then the reſt of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
Chriſtes ſheepe? None may be negligent in this office.
And he that doth the worke of the Lord,<note place="margin">Ier. 48. 10.</note> (eſpecially this worke)
negligently, is accurſed by Gods owne mouth. We muſt all
doe it to the vttermoſt of our power. And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was not
afraid to ſaie,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 10.</note> that he laboured more aboundantly then all the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
meaning in the preaching of the word. So that it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
that this office was not eſpecially committed to <hi>Peter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Theoph. in Ioh. cap. 21.</note> but
that I may ſay with <hi>Theophilact</hi> vpon theſe wordes. Let Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
and preachers heare, what is commended vnto them.</p>
            <p>Feede (ſaith Chriſt) my ſheepe, bring with thee thy mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie,
if thou wile ſet foorth thy loue to the great ſheepehearde.
Then alſo maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> will proue out of theſe wordes
and that eaſilie as he ſaieth,<note place="margin">De pontifi Rom. lib. 1. cap. 15.</note> that <hi>Peter</hi> hereby hath the chiefe
power.<note place="margin">To rule and to haue chiefe rule not all one.</note> But indeede he onely prooueth that to feede is to rule,
whereas he promiſeth to proue with eaſe, that to feed is to haue
the chiefe rule.</p>
            <p>But you muſt heare with him, the brightneſſe of <hi>Peters</hi>
chaire at Rome hath ſo daſeled his eies, that he cannot eſpie ſo
ſmall a miſſe. But the weight of all conſiſteth in the laſt point
that he handleth concevning this place,<note place="margin">Lib. 1. cap 16.</note> and therefore about it he
beſtoweth ſome more labour. And firſt he affirmeth that he
is ſure and certaine, that euen all chriſtians, yea euen the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
themſelues, are as ſheepe committed to <hi>Peter.</hi> For his
trifling coniectures of the difference betweene lambes and ſheep,
they are not worth ſpeaking of. But let vs ſee what force is in
his notable reaſon, for himſelfe ſo calleth it, he ſo well liketh of
it.<note place="margin">Bellar his Arg. to proue Peter to be a vniuerſall paſt.</note> Chriſt moſt manifeſtly (ſaieth he) committeth to <hi>Peter</hi>
all thoſe ſheepe, of which he may ſay they are mine, but he may
ſaie ſo of all chriſtians, therefore all chriſtians are <hi>Peters</hi> ſheep.
If maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> had good ſtore of ſtrong reaſons to proue
his aſſertion, he would neuer make ſo much of ſo blunt a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon.
For he can neuer proue his maior.</p>
            <p>Chriſt ſaide not feede all my ſheepe,<note place="margin">Anſwere.</note> for he knewe that he
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:7294:24"/>
could not doe, but onely feede my ſheepe. Now this is as the
Logicians doe tearme it an Indeſtuite propoſition. Which
hath no limitation, but may be vnderſtoode as occaſion ſerueth,
ſo that to make it more particular or generall, we muſt haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde
to the circumſtances of the place. And is it not verie
ſtrange, that he which here will make a vniuerſall propoſition
of that that is not ſo,<note place="margin">Lib. 2. cap. 8.</note> to force out of it an argument, where in
truth there is none, will be as bolde at another time to make of
a vniuerſall propoſition a particular.<note place="margin">2. Tim. 4. 16.</note> No man ſaith Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
aſſiſted mee, all men forſooke mee, that is ſaieth he none of
them that ſhould haue helped me with the Emperour. And ſo
he applieth perchance to one or two, that the apoſtle ſpeaketh
doubtleſſe of all that profeſſed religion then at <hi>Rome,</hi> as though
he were euen the creatour of Lodgicke, and would haue it as his
creature, to frame it ſelfe, to ſerue his turne.</p>
            <p>But to come to the point. As he affirmeth all euen the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
by theſe wordes to be committed to <hi>Peter:</hi> ſo I doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently
pronounce,<note place="margin">This charge feed my ſheepe hath a limitation.</note> that out of theſe wordes, and ſome other
circumſtances, great reaſons may be gathered, to ſhewe <hi>Peters</hi>
authority in theſe wordes to haue a limitation. And firſt this
worde <hi>my ſheepe,</hi> which maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> maketh the chiefe
ſtrength of his argument, doth make much for that interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which I take to be the true and natui all ſence of the place.
When the meaning of our ſauiour Chriſt, is to ſpeake of that
generall charge ouer all, then he vttereth it in other wordes, Go
teach all nations,<note place="margin">Matth. 28. 19<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Mark, 16. 15.</note> and againe going into the whole world, preach
the goſpell vnto euery creature. But here is no ſuch generall
charge but onely feede my ſheepe.<note place="margin">Chriſtes peculiar ſheepe.</note> What are theſe ſheepe that
Chriſt calleth my ſheepe? We knowe that Chriſt after a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
meaning, calleth the Iewes his people and his ſheepe.
He ſaieth he is not ſent,<note place="margin">Matth. 15. 24.</note> but to the loſt ſheepe of the houſe of
Iſraell.</p>
            <p>And as though in compariſon of the Iewes, he made no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the gentiles, he ſaith it is not meete to take the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens
bread, (meaning the ſaluation that was ſent to the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites)
and caſt it to the dogges. Therefore Chriſt by this worde
my ſheepe meaneth (as it ſhould ſeeme) the people to whome
he eſpecially was ſent, amongſt whom he was borne, to whom
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:7294:25"/>
hee preached,<note place="margin">Lib. 1. cap. 16.</note> (as alſo Maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> for that preferreth
<hi>Poters</hi> miniſterie among the Iewes) and amongſt whom hee
died, that is the Iewes.</p>
            <p>And beſides the manner of ſending of his Apoſtles vnto their
generall charge, (whereof I haue already ſpoken) which is farre
differing from this, the very office that we know was laide vpon
<hi>Peter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 2. 7.</note> doeth much confirme this interpretation. For Saint
<hi>Paule</hi> ſaith that the goſpell ouer the circumciſion was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to him, as the goſpell ouer the vncircumciſion was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to <hi>Peter.</hi> Wee ſee therefore that <hi>Peter</hi> had a peculiar
charge and calling, to bee the apoſtle of the Iewes. Which is
proofe ſtrong enough, to prooue that Chriſt neuer meant, to
commit anie ſuch generall charge ouer all the world vnto him,
vnleſſe we will imagine, that Chriſt did firſt he knew not what,
and afterwardes reuoked his former commiſſion. I ſaie this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation
of <hi>Peter,</hi> eſpeciallie, although not onlie, to one peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
people, is as it were a reuocation, of his former vniuerſall cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
if any ſuch had beene, or rather becauſe indeed none ſuch
was, it is inſteede of a commentarie vpon theſe wordes, feede
my ſheepe, to teach vs how to vnderſtand them. Feed my ſheep,
that is the Iewes, whom I haue eſpecially committed to thee,
as I alſo tooke paines almoſt wholy and only among them.</p>
            <p>Furthermore alſo when Saint <hi>Paule</hi> telleth vs that the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
ouer the vncircumciſion, was committed to him, as vnto <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
the goſpell was committed ouer the circumciſion, his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
is to tell vs, that Chriſt hath as well placed him ouer the
Gentiles, as <hi>Peter</hi> ouer the Iewes. And therefore of himſelfe
he ſaith that he was ſeperated vnto the goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 1. Actes. 13. 2.</note>
becauſe God commanded them, to ſeperate vnto him <hi>Paule</hi> and
<hi>Barnabas,</hi> to the worke whereunto hee had called them. And
what this worke is,<note place="margin">Act. 22. 21.</note> is another place declared, depart for I will
ſend thee, farre hence vnto the Gentiles. Which his calling to
the Gentiles,<note place="margin">Gal. 1. 16.</note> hee alſo ſpeaketh of vnto the <hi>Galathians,</hi> aſſuring
himſelfe that God called him to that office.</p>
            <p>But now for <hi>Peter,</hi> we muſt not doubt, but that hee alſo
was called of God. For they are not to be heard, that woulde
make vs beleeue that it was but a couenant among themſelues,
that <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould preach to the Iewes; <hi>Paule</hi> to the Gentiles,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:7294:25"/>
but <hi>Paule</hi> doth aſſure himſelfe of his calling in that he that was
mightie in <hi>Peter,</hi> was mightie in him alſo. Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> on
the <hi>Galathians lib. 1. cap.</hi> 2. very well writeth, One and the
ſelfeſame (Chriſt) committed to mee the goſpell of the vncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion,
(ſpeaking in the perſon of <hi>Paule</hi>) who committed
to <hi>Peter</hi> the goſpell of the circumciſion. If then <hi>Peter</hi> was by
Chriſt called to this apoſtleſhippe, where was it, when, in
what woordes? In all the Scripture there is not auie one
place but this, wherein he is called by Chriſt to this miniſterie
ouer the Iewes. And therefore Chriſtes ſheepe, are rather
that peculiar people that were (as no man denieth) committed
to <hi>Peter,</hi> then the whole world, whereof in Scripture, they
haue no probable coniecture. And this interpretation, I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
that Maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath not ſought to confute, ſeeing
it is about two hundreth and ſeuentie yeare olde. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunce
hee thought it reſted vppon ſtronger reaſon, then
hee was able to conuince or confute, and therefore hee let it
alone.</p>
            <p>Other argumentes are alſo alleadged to diſprooue this ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie
of <hi>Peter</hi> ouer all,<note place="margin">Arguments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Peters ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy.</note> and to ſhew that theſe words feede
my ſheepe, cannot giue vnto him anie ſuch ſoueraignty. Saint
<hi>Paule</hi> acknowledged no ſuch ſubiection to him,<note place="margin">Gal. 2.</note> when hee doth
not only pronounce, that hee learned nothing of them that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to be chiefe, but alſo withſtoode <hi>Peter</hi> in the face becauſe
he was worthy to be reproued.</p>
            <p>Out of which wordes howe lightlie ſo euer Maiſter <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi>
woulde caſt them off, with this diſtinction that they
were fellowes in preaching, but not in gouerning (as though
the preaching of the woorde, and the practiſe or gouernement
according to the ſame were then ſeperated) yet Saint <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi>
and <hi>Theophilact</hi> vpon this place doe teach, that there
was no inequality betweene them, and that <hi>Paule</hi> was nothing
inferiour to <hi>Peter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And marke howe abſurdly he woulde daube vppe the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

are great apoſtles. If Saint <hi>Paule</hi> had ſo meant, he woulde
not haue ſaid that they ſeeme to be ſomewhat, but that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
are ſomewhat. And thus maſter <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> rather than
he will ſay nothing, will peruert the very ſenſe of ſcripture: for
theſe wordes, no doubt, are expounded, by thoſe that followe in
that verſe, they that ſeemed to bee ſomewhat gaue nothing to

<hi>Bellarmine</hi> would make vs beleeue, that the iuriſdiction was

him.<note place="margin">Argument. 3. Act. 6. 2. Bellarmine his reply. Anſwere.</note> Againe the apoſtles I ſay the twelue (not <hi>Peter</hi>) did call

ſeeing there is not one word to warrant it? Why ſhould we
imagine, that rather of him then of another? As for conſenting
we are ſure he conſented, for it was done by a generall conſent.
<hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> were ſent by the reſt to <hi>Samaria,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 8. 14. Argument. 4.</note> to inſtruct
them how happened it that they would ſend him, if hee might
commaund them all? Had the Apoſtles authoritie to ſend him?
Then was not he aboue them. Had they no authority? Then
did they abuſe him, which is not to be thought of ſo godly men
as they were. And howſoeuer maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would ſalue
the matter, in telling vs that ſending doth not import alwaies a

the pope now would not take in good part, that his colledge of
Cardinals ſhould ſend him about any ſuch buſineſſe. Neither
is that argument brought to prooue a ſubiection in him vnto
them, but that hee is not their ruler, or that they owe him no
ſubiection. And therefore Maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> his anſwere that
ſending doth not alwaies ſignifie ſubiection is nothing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:7294:26"/>
But I am wearie in ſpending time about his trifling cauils,
who though he cannot ſoundly refell the argumentes that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
their doctrine, yet will hee not confeſſe the truth, and
ſo giue glorie vnto God.</p>
            <p>Hauing thus examined I truſt ſufficiently, the chiefeſt
thinges alleadged by Maiſter <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> concerning theſe two
places of Scripture, which eſpecially they reſt vpon: I muſt
alſo brieflie examine his ſecond ſort of proofes which hee promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to vſe,<note place="margin">Lib. 1. cap. 10. Bellarmine his ſecond ſort of argument from Peters preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue.</note> and that is grounded vpon the prerogatiues that are
aſcribed to <hi>Peter.</hi> Wherein I ſhall bee the ſhorter, becauſe
many of them, are rather to make a ſhewe of proofe, then
worth alleadging. The changing of his name from <hi>Simon</hi> to
<hi>Peter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">De Rom. pontif. lib. 1. cap. 17. 18. &amp;c.</note> when hee was firſt called, prooueth not that hee was
made head of the Church. For hee had that name about three
yeares and a halfe,<note place="margin">Iohn. 1. 42.</note> before they aſcribe vnto him this headſhippe.
Likewiſe that he is commonlie named firſt, is a weake proofe.
For if that ſhoulde ſignifie his headſhip, then ſhoulde it neuer
haue beene placed otherwiſe then firſt, but Saint <hi>Paule</hi> who
knew well enough what place he ſhould giue to <hi>Peter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Galath. 2. 9.</note> nameth
<hi>Iames</hi> before him. He walked on the waters. It is true, but
what is out of that concluded? Is hee therefore the head of the
church? Not ſo. Fourthlie hee firſt of all knew the hie miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of our faith ſay they: if he did, can that make him heade of
the church? It cannot. Fiftlie it is ſaide the gates of hell ſhall
not preuaile againſt it. That is the church as the fathers teach
almoſt with one conſent, and therefore that is the catholicke ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.
But that which out of <hi>Origen</hi> hee alleadgeth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is contrarie to the text, and teſtimonie of the moſt of the
godlie, is iuſtlie reiected.</p>
            <p>And for that they woulde prooue the ſupremacie becauſe
Chriſt ſaide to <hi>Peter</hi> pay for mee and thee, is anſwered page
thirty-ſixe. That hee praide for <hi>Peter</hi> it is not ſingular, for
hee praieth for all that the father hath giuen him.<note place="margin">Iohn. 17.</note> If hee will
confirme his brethen, it is no maruell, becauſe hee that had
more experience then others of his owne weakeneſſe, is fitteſt
to make others ſeeke for true ſtrength and not to truſt to their
owne, that will deceiue them. But hee firſt of all the Apoſtles
ſaw Chriſt, after his reſurrection, what then? If that maie
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:7294:27"/>
giue the headſhip of the church,<note place="margin">Marke 16. Iohn 20.</note> 
               <hi>Marie Magdalene</hi> ſhoulde
bee the head, for ſhee ſawe Chriſt firſt, yea although <hi>Peter</hi>
and <hi>Iohn</hi> did runne to ſeeke for him, yet hee woulde not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
firſt vnto <hi>Peter,</hi> to take away the very ſtrength of this
their argument. If Chriſt waſhed the feete of <hi>Peter</hi> firſt (if
I ſay, for it may iuſtly bee doubted of) muſt that giue him
the ſupremacy?</p>
            <p>The like argument may be gathered out of that that Chriſt
foretelleth <hi>Peter</hi> of his death, <hi>Actes</hi> the firſt chapter and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
verſe.</p>
            <p>And for the twelfth prerogatiue, where he maketh <hi>Peter</hi>
as the good man of the houſe, to gather together into one place
the companie of Diſciples, it is grounded vpon a fiction. For,
there is not one word, that hee gathered them: But there is
ſomewhat to bee gathered againſt <hi>Peters</hi> Supremacy. For,
although hee mooued them to appoint one in <hi>Iudas</hi> his roome,
yet hee appointed not one, as the Pope woulde very readily
haue chalenged that priuiledge. Not <hi>Peter,</hi> but they, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
two.<note place="margin">Verſe 23. Verſe 24.</note> They prayed. They alſo gaue them lots not <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would reply that theſe actions yet
muſt be performed by one, and by likelihoode this one ſhoulde
be <hi>Peter,</hi> wee will not ſticke to graunt him ſo much. But if
<hi>Peter</hi> had beene ſupreame head of the church, heere had beene
good occaſion to haue named him as direttor in theſe actions,
which wee ſee is not done.</p>
            <p>The thirteenth prerogatiue <hi>Peter</hi> firſt preached after the
receiuing of the holieghoſt.<note place="margin">Act. 2.</note> This maketh not him Supreame
head.</p>
            <p>And herein the Popes can not claime to bee <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours.
Hee wrought the firſt myracle,<note place="margin">Act. 3.</note> but the text ioyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<hi>Iohn</hi> with <hi>Peter,</hi> which ſhoulde not haue beene doone,
if it had beene any argument for <hi>Peters</hi> ſupremacie,<note place="margin">Act. 5.</note> to haue it
thought, that hee wrought the firſt miracle.</p>
            <p>For the fifteenth prerogatiue commeth the deſtruction of
<hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> which was by that power that GOD
gaue, not to <hi>Peter</hi> onely, but to them all, <hi>Marke</hi> the ſixe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth

            </p>
            <p>The ſixteenth prerogatiue is taken out of the ninth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

preaching is commended, in that hee trauelled, throughout
all quarters. Which the Popes friends for very ſhame ſhould
neuer haue ſpoken of. For, if ſo bee that his diligence be an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of his ſupremacie, as they faine would make it, then
why is not the Popes ſupine negligence in that function, as
ſtrong an argument againſt this Supremacie?</p>
            <p>Wee will admit (although it iuſtly may be doubted of)
that which is the ground of this ſeuenteenth prerogatiue,<note place="margin">Act. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Peter</hi> firſt did preach vnto the Gentiles. And muſt that needs
prooue that hee is therefore head of the church? I am ſure that
maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe will confeſſe, that it is no neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie
argument. But prayer was made without ceaſing vnto
God for him.</p>
            <p>It is a token that the Church (ſeeing the perſecution
that nowe beganne againſt the godly, and that <hi>Peter</hi> alſo a
woorthy miniſter of the worde, and a great apoſtle was in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger)
was very carefull for his preſeruation. But this doeth
not prooue him to be the head of the church,<note place="margin">Act. 12. 5.</note> no more then the
care that the godly had ouer Saint <hi>Paule, Actes</hi> the ſeuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
chapter and tenth verſe, in ſending him away to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea,
by night, for his better ſafety, or letting him downe
by a windowe in a baſket,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 11. 33.</note> when hee was in great danger in

to be head, but as if he had forgoten himſelfe all this while, hee

it in any ſuch reſpect, he would and ſhould at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

had taken his office vpon him haue had <hi>Peters</hi> alowance. And
thus much concerning <hi>Peters</hi> priuileges or prerogatiues which
they alleage out of Gods booke. Which although many of them
are euident arguments of excellent graces, that God had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
vpon him, and great mercies which God ſhewed to him,
yet if maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> or any other, will out of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
<hi>Peters</hi> ſupremacie, the weakneſſe of his argument will be
ſeene of very children. But yet becauſe before he made <hi>Peters</hi>
prerogatiues his ſecond proofe of this his ſupremacie, I haue
thought it neceſſarie to reckon them, (for other confutation of
them needeth not) that all may ſee what weak proofes they doe
bring, for this their chiefe point of doctrine. As for the other
eight prerogatiues, they are not worth ſpeaking of: Both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we may iuſtly doubt of the truth of many of them, as being
proued but by fabulous writings: and alſo becauſe if they were
true, it were not matteriall for the point in queſtion. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
letting them alone as rotten propes which will fall in pieces
of themſelues, if any weight be layed vpon them, I haſten to his
third proofe that hee promiſed. And that is out of the fathers.
And herein it is needles to examine euerie particular teſtimony.<note place="margin">Lib. 1. cap. 10. How the fathers aſcribe much vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Peter.</note>
Onely I will ſet downe in what ſenſe the fathers truly may,
and often doe, aſcribe vnto Saint <hi>Peter</hi> many excellent titles,
that thereby examining the fathers, and finding them to keepe
within the bounds of gods word, we may with reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce receiue
them. But if they paſſe thoſe liſts, I truſt maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
and al his friends will beare with vs, if we reiect the doctrine of
men, as himſelfe in this very booke before, refuſeth the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Origene</hi> and <hi>Theophilact,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cap. 12.</note> and of others in other
places. Firſt therefore this word in latine <hi>primatus</hi> which wee
now call Supremacie, but indeede doth ſignifie (that I may
make ſuch a word) <hi>Firſtneſſe,</hi> is aſcribed vnto <hi>Peter</hi> of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in reſpect of time as in the place alleaged here out of <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,</hi>

him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:7294:28"/>
This place is alleadged by maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> often, to proue
<hi>Peters</hi> ſupremacy or iuriſdiction ouer others. But the wordes
are very plaine that <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſpeaketh, of his being firſt, not in
dignity, but in tune, as appeareth not onely in that he ſaith he
was firſt choſen, but alſo, by the wordes of newe ones or after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commers.
But maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> wil ſay,<note place="margin">Iob. 1. 39. 40.</note> that <hi>Andrew</hi> was
choſen before him to be an apoſtle, and therefore, that <hi>Cyprian</hi>
was deceiued, if ſo he meant. It may ſo be. For men may erre.
But the queſtion is not nowe, whether <hi>Cyprians</hi> iudgement
herein be true or not, but vpon what occaſion, or in what reſpect
<hi>Cyprian</hi> giueth <hi>Peter</hi> the primacy, which is moſt plainly in
this place ſet downe to be in reſpect of time. And ſo may other
of the fathers in this reſpect vſe this word, and giue him this ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.
And ſometime this title of primacy is giuen vnto him in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde
of ſome excellent thinges that he was indued withall,<note place="margin">Firſt in reſpect of ſome execl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent graces.</note> by
reaſon whereof, his fellowes and brethren amongſt themſelues,
and the fathers after, might giue vnto him ſome kinde of reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
in name or otherwiſe. But this wil do no good for proofe
of popiſh ſupremacy. For they doe hold, that <hi>Peter</hi> in his owne
right, and by that iuriſdiction which by Gods word he hath, is
head of the church, and hath the ſupremacy aboue all other. We
ſay that becauſe of his gifts of zeale, knowledge, conſtancy, or
boldnes, he was admitted and allowed to ſpeake and to doe,
many things,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 5. 1.</note> but that in his owne right, he was but equall with
the reſt and as he calleth himſelfe a <hi>fellowe elder,</hi> with them
that were meaner then apoſtles.</p>
            <p>Therefore to be a chiefe man,<note place="margin">Head men haue not alwaies in their own right iuriſdiction ouer other.</note> or a head man among them, is
not to prooue him to haue iuriſdiction ouer them. In all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations
or fellowſhips, as aldermen in citties, although in
regarde of that place, they are alike, none more or leſſe an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman
then another: yet among them, ſome are better eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of, euen of themſelues, becauſe of their learning, wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
dexterity in gouernement, credit, power, or wealth, not
becauſe they can in right claime it, but becauſe other doe for
ſuch things as they ſee in them, yeelde it vnto them, not that
they haue power ouer them, but onely they are of good accompt
among them.</p>
            <p>And thus much to proue, that that is not ſufficient, which
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:7294:29"/>
maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith will ſerue the turne, to proue that the
fathers ſay that <hi>Peter</hi> was head,<note place="margin">Lib. 1. cap. 25.</note> or had primacy ouer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church.
For neither his eſtimation in reſpect of his gifts, neither if by
voluntary ſubiection they did ſubmit themſelues vnto him, it
can proue him to haue right to rule ouer them. And this they
muſt proue, or els they gaiue nothing to their cauſe, that <hi>Peter</hi>
by the word of God, hath authority ouer the whole church, and
ouer the apoſtles. And therefore it maketh no great matter,
what men ſay of <hi>Peters</hi> authority, but how truely they grounde
their ſayings vpon Gods word. And thus I truſt it appeareth
to the indifferent reader, that the minor propoſition of that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
which I haue ſet downe in the end of my anſwere vnto
maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ninth chapter of this booke,<note place="margin">Pag. 12.</note> wherein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth
the great ſtrength of the popiſh Monarchy, is not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
vnto the truth, or catholike doctrine, howſoeuer that church
of Rome, reioiceth in that title that is none of hers, thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing
the world, as if all that ſhee taught were ſound and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike.</p>
            <p>The propoſition is this that Chriſt gane iuriſdiction vnto
<hi>Peter,</hi> ouer the vniuerſal church. The chiefeſt profes that either
they all haue, or that maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> can alleadge, is out of
Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> the xvi. where they ſay this iuriſdiction is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed,
and Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> xxi. where they ſay it is giuen, which
their interpretation as I haue ſhewed cannot ſtand with the text
it ſelfe or the interpretations of the ſounder fathers. His ſecond
reaſon which conſiſteth of the prerogatiues which Saint <hi>Peter</hi>
had, is grounded either vpon fables, that deſerue no credit, or
vpon impertiment matters, that proue nothing to the purpoſe, as
if I be forced hereafter therto, I doubt not by Gods grace with
eaſe to proue. His third and laſt reaſon, is of it ſelfe ſufficient to
ſhew, that themſelues haue no great hope to proue it to be a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
doctrine, that is a doctrine taught and beleeued of all the
godly,<note place="margin">Vincent. Lyrin.</note> or almoſt of all, at all times, in all places, for <hi>Vincentius
Lyrinenſis</hi> thus defyneth catholike. But the firſt authour that
maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> alleadgeth,<note place="margin">Bellar. his 3. arg. for the ſuprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, is out of the fathers.</note> is more then two hundreth yeers
after Chriſt. So that the doctrine that cannot be proued, to
haue bene beleeued for two hundreth yeares, in the pureſt times
of the church, cannot be called catholike, or be ſaid to haue the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7294:29"/>
true antiquitie. And yet there is nothing that ſoundeth ſo much
in the mouthes of our aduerſaries as Catholike, Catholike, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie,
Antiquitie, whereas in trueth nothing can be catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
vnleſſe it haue the true antiquitie: And the true antiquitie
muſt begin at God himſelfe. It muſt ſpring from him as from
the firſt fountaine. As moſt notably, and more than once, that
ancient and learned father <hi>Tertullian</hi> hath ſaid,<note place="margin">De praeſcript. ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſ. haeretic.</note> That there is
nothing true, but that onely which the church receiued of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
the apoſtles from Chriſt, Chriſt from God. And this
is indeede ancient trueth, and true antiquitie.</p>
            <p>Now I muſt alſo take a view of the maior propoſition which
is this,<note place="margin">The conſutation of the maior for popiſh ſupremacy ſet downe pa. 11. De Rom. pontif. lib. 2. cap. 2.</note> whatſoener iuriſdiction Chriſt gaue to <hi>Peter,</hi> and not to
the reſt of the apoſtles, al that belongeth to the church of Rome.
And maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> beginneth to prooue this in his ſecond
Booke, beginning with <hi>Peters</hi> being at Rome. But whether
he were there or not, it maketh no great matter. For it is laide
of <hi>Paule,</hi> and <hi>Marke,</hi> and others, that they were there alſo, but
that maketh them not ſupreame heades of the church. But,
whereas he confidently affirmes,<note place="margin">Whether Peter firſt preached at Rome.</note> that many of the fathers teach,
that <hi>Peter</hi> firſt of all preached to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> and founded
the church there, becauſe perchance he thereupon would inferre,
that he was then biſhop of Rome: it is not amiſſe to examin his
proofe herein.</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Iraen. lib 3. c. 3. Iraeny his place examined.</note> that which he alleageth out of <hi>Iraeney,</hi> that the church
of Rome was founded by <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paule,</hi> maketh nothing for
proofe of <hi>Peters</hi> firſt founding the church there: for <hi>Iraeny</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
them both alike in that worke. Neither by founding the
church can be meant the firſt beginning of the ſame, but rather,
that they by their teſtimony and death, did confirme the godlie
there, and perfected and eſtabliſhed the church that was already
begunne by all likelihoode, as after ſhall be ſhewed.</p>

that Rome was conuerted to Chriſt,<note place="margin">Contra gentes lib. 2. Arnob. anſwered.</note> becauſe it ſawe the fierie

ſaieth,<note place="margin">Heref. 27. Epipha. anſwered.</note> that <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paule</hi> were firſt apoſtles and biſhops in

of <hi>Turon</hi> ſay, that <hi>Peter</hi> being there, Chriſtians beganne, which
may be vnderſtoode of their more bolde profeſſion of Chriſtianitie
then before. For that there were chriſtians before <hi>Peter</hi> came,
there are in my iudgement ſtrong reaſons to prooue. Indeede
<hi>Theodoret</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Ad Rom. cap. 1. Peter preached not firſt at Rome. Sadol. ad Rom. cap. 16.</note> that great <hi>Peter</hi> firſt preached to them the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
of the goſpell. Perchance he meant that he (not firſt of all)
but firſt of the apoſtles, did preach the goſpell there. For <hi>Sadolet</hi>
a Cardinall and a Romiſh catholike, in his commentaries vpon
<hi>Paules</hi> epiſtle to the Romaines, doth thinke that the goſpell was
firſt preached, and the church at Rome firſt aſſembled, by ſome of
the diſciples that fled out of <hi>Iury.</hi> And he nameth <hi>Priſcilla, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quila,
Andronicus</hi> and <hi>Iunia.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 16. 7.</note> And in this reſpect, it ſeemeth
that <hi>Paule</hi> giueth this commendation vnto <hi>Andronicus</hi> and <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>
that they were notable among the apoſtles, becauſe their
miniſtery was ſo neceſſary for the church there, (for he doeth not
in anie other Epiſtle ſpeake of them.) But in this epiſtle <hi>Sado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let</hi>
ſaith that Saint <hi>Paule</hi> doth giue vnto them, this great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation,
that they might haue the better credite among the
godly at Rome, and the greater reuerence, might be ſhewed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:7294:30"/>
them, in diſcuſſing and ending of theſe controuerſies,
which were begunne amongſt them, and for ſtaying of which
Saint <hi>Paule</hi> doth write this Epiſtle as <hi>Sadolet</hi> confeſſeth.
And of theſe <hi>Primaſius</hi> an ancient father ſaith in like ſorte,<note place="margin">Primaſ. ad Rom.</note> that
<hi>Andronicus</hi> and <hi>Iunia</hi> were accounted notable amongſt others
that were ſent to Rome, by whom they might beleeue, or by
whoſe example they might haue beene confirmed. Now if <hi>Peter</hi>
had beene the firſt that preached there, which maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
a papiſt affirmeth, but <hi>Sadolet</hi> a Cardinall very confidentlie
denieth,<note place="margin">Rom. 15. 20.</note> Saint <hi>Paule,</hi> who woulde not builde vppon anothers
foundation, as he writeth vnto the Romanes, would not haue
taken vpon him to haue decided their controuerſies, and to haue
commended vnto them the miniſterie of others alſo to that ende,
but would either not at all haue medled with them, or haue put
them in minde of <hi>Peter</hi> their Biſhop.<note place="margin">Rom. 15. 15. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</note> But contrariwiſe hee
challengeth them for his owne flocke, and as belonging to his
charge, which wrong he would neuer haue offered to Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
if he firſt had planted the church and his ſeat there. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
would the Iewes (who in euery place were <hi>Peters</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
charge) that were at Rome, when <hi>Paule</hi> came thither, bee
ſo deſirous to be inſtructed of <hi>Paule</hi> as they were,<note place="margin">Act. 21. 22.</note> if they had
beene taught before by <hi>Peter,</hi> and he had beene their Biſhop

knowne their owne biſhop, to be the vniuerſall biſhop or head of

            <p>And thus I truſt, that notwithſtanding all that out of ſome
doubtfull ſentences of ancient writers, maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath
gathered, yet this point is not ſo cleere for the church of Rome,
as they would perſwade the world that it is. But rather the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
appeareth moſt true, that <hi>Peter</hi> was not the firſt that prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
at Rome. As for that which maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge
concerning Saint <hi>Markes</hi> goſpell,<note place="margin">Bellar. obiect.</note> that it is written at

yet I haue I truſt good reaſon and ſufficient warrant not to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
the ſame.</p>
            <p>Now whether <hi>Peter</hi> died at Rome or not,<note place="margin">Whether Peter died at Rome. Lib. 2. cap. 3.</note> which is the next
point that is handled by maiſter <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> I will not much

pointes, that belong to the proofe of their maior propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which is, that <hi>Peters</hi> prerogatiues, belong to the biſhop of
Rome (if wee will beleeue the papiſts) by Chriſts inſtitution.
And herein I would craue of the indifferent reader,<note place="margin">Canus. lib. 6. loc. Theol. cap. 8.</note> without par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiaſity
to iudge, whether this their doctrine of <hi>Peters</hi> beeing Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop

not.<note place="margin">Whether Peter were biſhop of Rome. 25 yeares.</note>
            </p>
            <p>For maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> maketh a proud but a falſe brag, that
it hath the teſtimony and conſent of all the ancient writers.<note place="margin">Lib. 2. cap. 4. Bellar. firſt arg.</note> As
for his firſt reaſon whereby he will proue him to bee biſhop there,
becauſe of the dignity or great account that hath beene alwaies
made of the church of Rome,<note place="margin">Pag. 13. 14. Anſwere.</note> it is very weake. For the Church
of Rome was accounted off more then others (as before I ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out of the councel of Chalcedon &amp; Ireny) becauſe Rome was
the imperiall citie. And no doubt alſo but that greater concourſe
of learned men, in that reſpect was there then els where; which
muſt needes cauſe that place, to bee in better eſtimation.
So that of this cannot <hi>Peters</hi> being Biſhoppe there bee conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:7294:31"/>
Secondly whereas hee will prooue that he was Biſhoppe of
Rome,<note place="margin">Bellarm, 2. arg.</note> becauſe where he was biſhop after that he leſte <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che</hi>
it cannot be ſhewed,<note place="margin">Anſwere.</note> this his proofe is like the former. For
ſeeing he was an apoſtle, what neceſſitie is there, that he muſt
be biſhop in ſome peculiar ſeate or place? Where was <hi>Paule</hi>
biſhop? It appeareth by the ſtory of the Scripture, that he was
no where biſhop.<note place="margin">Arg. 3. Bellarm, out of fathers.</note> And why then ſhould wee of neceſſity make

               </gap>hop in ſome chaire? Maiſter <hi>Bellarmines</hi> third
argument, which is the teſtimony of the fathers, hee imagineth
will beare all downe before it. But firſt wee muſt conſider that
the fathers were content at the firſt,<note place="margin">Why the fathers did not much gainfay Peters being biſhop of Rome.</note> to receiue this thing as a
truth without any great examination of it, becauſe it was but a
matter of ſtory, and ſo not much materiall whether, hee were
biſhop of Rome or not. But if they had beene in our daies,
and ſeene what neceſſary doctrine the church of Rome inferreth
thereupon, that it is a doctrine that we muſt beleeue, or els wee
cannot be ſaued, that <hi>Peter</hi> was biſhop of Rome, and of the
whole Church, and then for that the biſhop of Rome is <hi>Peters</hi>
ſucceſſour, in that vniuerſall biſhopricke, and that by Chriſtes
inſtitution, and that this muſt be beleeued vpon paine of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
No doubt but euen thoſe godly fathers who ſeeme moſt to
ſpeake of that chaire of <hi>Peter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In Iof. cap. 20. Hom. 85.</note> woulde haue ſaide as <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome</hi>

ſpeake of the Prieſtes ſitting in <hi>Moſes</hi> chaire, but in Chriſtes
chaire, hee I ſay, and the reſt would haue proclaimed it lowde
inough, that they are the true Biſhops not that ſit in <hi>Peters</hi>
chaire, but in Chriſts chaire.</p>
            <p>But I haue ſundry ſtrong argumentes to induce not my
ſelfe onlie,<note place="margin">To beleeue that Peter was biſhop of Rome is no catholicke ſaith.</note> but I truſt euen others alſo, to be aſſuredly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
(I will not ſaie that <hi>Peter</hi> was not Biſhoppe of
Rome) but that it is not a Catholicke Religion ſo to be
leeue.</p>
            <p>And firſt I will conſtantly affirme, that maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
and all the Ieſuites that take his part, ſhal not be able to prooue,
that the fathers of the firſt two hundreth yeares, that are of good
account or credite (for in this caſe I except what their Popes
and counterfet fathers haue written or taught) that <hi>Peter</hi>
was Biſhop of Rome. Which beeing prooued, it is as cleare
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:7294:32"/>
as the noone day, that is this not catholicke doctrine. Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
muſt needes confeſſe it.<note place="margin">Peters being bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Rome, not proued by the word.</note> Now for proofe of it, firſt that in
the Scriptures we haue no ſuch things taught, it is moſt plaine.
And Maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe, who would faine haue it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued:
yet dareth not affirme of this anie thing els, then that it
maie be that the Lord did openly command,<note place="margin">Lib. 2. cap. 12.</note> that <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould ſo
place his chaire at Rome, that abſolutely the biſhoppe of Rome
ſhould ſucceede him. And there hee addeth, that howſoeuer the
matter is, it is not ſo by the firſt inſtitution. And as in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
this thing hath no ground,<note place="margin">The firſt fathers knew no ſuch thing. Ignatius knew not Peters ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy.</note> ſo the fathers that liued in the
daies of the apoſtles, and next after them, doe not acknowledge
any ſuch matter. <hi>Ignatius</hi> who was Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> ſcholler maie
be a good witnes in this behalfe. All whoſe Epiſtles if we ſearch
and ſift, we ſhall not finde any thing in them, that teacheth vs
this point of popery, but rather the contrary. And yet he writing
vnto ſundry, and informing them in the moſt principall points of
religion, and ſuch things as were moſt neceſſary for chriſtians to
know, yea, and among other to the Romanes themſelues, muſt
needes haue informed them of this vniuerſall biſhop and of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
chaire,<note place="margin">Ign. ad Trallia, &amp; ad Romanes.</note> if he had knowen of anie ſuch matter: in his ſeconde
Epiſtle which is <hi>ad Tiallianos</hi> I commaund not ſaith he as an
apoſtle, and to the Romanes I commaund not theſe thinges as
<hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paule.</hi> In both places hee had good occaſion to
haue vrged them with <hi>Peters</hi> ſupremacie, but eſpecially he ſhould
haue put the Romanes in minde of <hi>Peter,</hi> if hee had beene their
biſhop. And ſhould haue ſaid I doe not inioyne you theſe thinges
as <hi>Peter,</hi> who was your biſhop. But the greateſt matter that
he eſpieth in <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paule,</hi> is that they are apoſtles. And
writing vnto the <hi>Epheſians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ign. ad Epheſ.</note> he moueth them to depende vpon
their biſhop, as the Church hangeth vpon the Lord, and the Lord
vpon his father.</p>
            <p>How happeneth that in this reckoning of theſe goodly cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
the <hi>Epheſians</hi> and their biſhoppe, the church and Chriſt,
Chriſt and God, there is not any mention of <hi>Peter</hi> or his ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour?
Doubtleſſe as yet this conceit was not hatched, which
yet more plainely maie be ſeene in that exhortation that he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
to the Saintes in <hi>Smirna</hi> to honour God as the maker and
Lorde of all,<note place="margin">Igo. ad Simrna.</note> but their biſhoppe (for that he ſpeaketh of their
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:7294:32"/>
owne biſhop the whole epiſtle ſheweth) as the high prieſt the
Image of God, and the moſt excellent thing in the Church.
Nowe I pray yon what account is here of <hi>Peters</hi> chaire or of
his ſucceſſion? Not one word. This alſo in his epiſtle is to be
obſerued, that hee ſeemeth to make more eſpeciall account of
<hi>Paul</hi> then of <hi>Peter.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ign. ad Philad.</note> As writing to the Philadelphians, he ſaith
Be ye folowers of <hi>Paul</hi> and the other Apoſtles as they folowed
Chriſt, which it is to be thought he would not haue don, if <hi>Peter</hi>
had beene in ſuch account then, as ſince he is ſaid to be. Nowe
for <hi>Iuſtinus Martir</hi> who wrote about the yeare 147. doth neuer
ſo much as make mention of <hi>Peter</hi> being biſhop of Rome,
although in his ſecond Apologie he maketh mention of <hi>Simon
Magus</hi> how hee was honoured at Rome (but not of his fierie

Seeing therefore, <hi>Iuſtinus</hi> hauing ſo good an occaſton,

ſpeaketh not one worde of it there, neither yet afterwards in the

vnto the Romans, and yet nothing is there of <hi>Peter,</hi> that he
was biſhop there, but onely, that <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> did plant the
church there. And in the ſame place <hi>Euſebius</hi> reporteth of
<hi>Caius,</hi> who (as he ſaith) was made biſhop of Rome after <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phirinus</hi>)
which <hi>Zephirinus</hi> died the yeare of the Lord two

put him in minde of the monuments of the Apoſtles that he
could ſhew. Whereas hee might haue made a better bragge,
to hane ſerued for his purpoſe, if hee could haue told them, of
<hi>Peters</hi> chaire. But as yet there was no ſuch matter knowen.
As for that which maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe aleageth out of

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:7294:33"/>
there. Neither yet doth <hi>Cyprian</hi> plainly affirme, that
<hi>Peter</hi> was biſhop of Rome. He doth ſomtime indeede call that
church <hi>Peters</hi> chaire in reſpect of the doctrine that <hi>Peter</hi> taught
and publiſhed,<note place="margin">Peters chaire.</note> which at that time was beleeued at Rome, which
alſo perchance he in Rome confirmed by his death. As alſo our
Sauiour Chriſt ſpeaketh of <hi>Moſes</hi> chaire,<note place="margin">Moſes chaire, Mat. 23. 2.</note> and ſaith that the
prieſts did ſit in <hi>Moſes</hi> his chaire, ſo long as they taught the
lawe, that <hi>Moſes</hi> from God deliuered to them. But as for
<hi>Moſes</hi> hee neuer came neere the place where Ieruſalem was
built, to eſtabliſh any chaire there. And thus we ſee, that in all
theſe ancient fathers, who liued more then two hundred yeares
after Chriſt (for <hi>Ciprian</hi> floriſhed about two hundred and fiftie
yeares after Chriſt) there is no plaine proofe of <hi>Peters</hi> being
biſhop of Rome. And excepting <hi>Ciprians</hi> words, (who if he
allude vnto the words of our ſauiour Chriſt as he ſeemeth to do,
can make no more for the opinion of the church of Rome, then
any of the reſt) there is nothing in them all, that hath any like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood
of proofe of the thing in controuerſie. But if any man
anſwere that it is no good argument thus to reaſon.<note place="margin">Obiection.</note> Such
men haue not written that <hi>Peter</hi> was biſhop of Rome, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hee was not biſhop there:<note place="margin">Anſwere</note> I reply, that if this that out of
them hath beene ſaid, doe not ſubſtantially prooue, that <hi>Peter</hi>

prooue, that for this ſpace of more then two hundred yeares,
they cannot ſhew of any authentike author, that hath acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged

out of <hi>Origen,</hi> how <hi>Peter</hi> in the latter end of his life came to
Rome, and therefore he is not like to be Biſhoppe there xxv.
yeares. This doubtfulneſſe and vnconſtancie of their deliuering
this doctrine, is an infalible argument that there was not in
thoſe times, any catholike doctrine taught of this matter, but
that men might thinke thereof, as they ſaw cauſe. But now it
is no leſſe then hereſie to denie that <hi>Peter</hi> was Biſhoppe of
Rome.</p>
            <p>Now if vnto this that hath bin ſaid,<note place="margin">A third reaſon.</note> we adde the vocation or
office of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> recorded in the holy Scripture, that he
ſhould be the Apoſtle of the circumciſion,<note place="margin">Galat. 2. 7.</note> whereof, that euer he
was diſcharged, all the Ieſuites in Rome and Rheimes, will
neuer be able, out of Gods regiſter booke to ſhew. And one the
other ſide, that the ſingular care that the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
(who willingly woulde not build vpon another mans founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
ſheweth himſelfe to haue ouer the Romans, more then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
any other, euen as if they were his peculiar charge, (as iu
the firſt and fifteenth chapters of that epiſtle appeareth) I truſt
there is no man of indifferent iudgement, but will thinke that
we haue great reaſon to ſtay our ſelues, and not raſhly vpon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
ſhew of the newneſſe of fathers, to runne and conſent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſuch opinions, as haue no ſhew of the ancient antiquitie, no
agreement among themſelues, no colour of probabilitie in the
worde of God, but the contrarie rather. Neither is that any
anſwere to my ſecond argument,<note place="margin">Li. 2. c. 5. Bell. 06.</note> (which maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
doth ſaie) that the diſagreement about the time of <hi>Peters</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
vnto Rome, doeth not prooue that he came not at Rome
at all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:7294:34"/>
For my intent is not directly to proue, that <hi>Peter</hi> came not
to Rome as biſhop of Rome, but that this was not a catholike
doctrine for two hundred, or almoſt three hundred yeeres after
Chriſt, and this diſagreement doth proue that ſubſtantiallie. So
that it muſt bee another anſwere that muſt take awaie the
ſtrength of this argument, or elſe it ſtandeth vnaſwered. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is that example that he bringeth of the vncertaintie of the
time of Chriſtes death, fit to proue the matter in queſtion. For
all are agreed that Chriſt died,<note place="margin">Bellar. ob. 2. Anſwere.</note> but that <hi>Peter</hi> was biſhop of
Rome is not certaine. And therefore the thing it ſelfe beeing
doubted of, the vncertaine ſetting downe of the circumſtances,
will make it leſſe credited. I am not ignorant that godly lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
men, haue ſet downe manie moe arguments, to prooue
that <hi>Peter</hi> was not biſhop of Rome, and that maiſter <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>
beſtoweth ſixe or ſeuen chapters to anſwere the ſame as
well as he can. But my purpoſe being to trie as well as I can
how catholike their doctrine is, I content my ſelfe at this time
with theſe fewe. For to ſtriue what might bee ſpoken of this
matter, were an infinite labour. But whileſt I indeuour to goe
forward, I am forced a while to ſtay, and muſe at the immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
boldneſſe of maiſter <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who vpon ſo weake
proofe, will make ſo certaine a concluſion. For purpoſing to
ſhewe the biſhoppe of Rome is a vniuerſall biſhop,<note place="margin">Lib. 2. cap. 12. Bellarm. his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing before the victorie.</note> hee thus
beginneth. Hitherto we haue plainly ſhewed, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppe
of Rome is <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſour in the Biſhopricke of
Rome.</p>
            <p>Nowe conſidering with my ſelfe, the weakeneſſe of the
two poſtes that muſt vpholde this building, I though he might
haue ſomething at the leaſt miſtruſted his owne cauſe. For if
<hi>Peter</hi> were at Rome, and firſt preached there, doth that proue,
that therefore the Biſhop of Rome is his ſucceſſour? But by
that meanes all they that came afterward in the places where
he preached ſhall bee all his ſucceſſours, and not onely the
pope.</p>
            <p>The ſecond ground of this conſiderate concluſion, is, that
he imagineth that <hi>Peter</hi> was Biſhop of Rome, and ſo died.
But the vanitie of his arguments I haue diſcouered before (I
truſt) ſufficiently.<note place="margin">Pag. 56. &amp;<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:7294:34"/>
with this Sillogiſme, and ſo proceed.</p>
            <p>If it be not certaine that <hi>Peter</hi> was Biſhop of Rome, then
muſt this ſucceſſion of the Biſhop of Rome to <hi>Peter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Argument to the biſhop of Rome his ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to Peter to be vncertaine.</note> needes be
vncertaine.</p>
            <p>But it is vncertaine as I haue ſhewed by better reaſon then
maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath ſhewed, that <hi>Peter</hi> was biſhop there:</p>
            <p>Therefore I conclude, this ſucceſſion alſo, muſt needs be
vncertaine.</p>
            <p>But before I begin to examine <hi>Bellarmines</hi> euidence, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he will proue the pope to haue ſupremacie ouer all the church,
the Reader muſt bee put in minde of that which before I haue
ſaid, whereby the very ground of this ſupremacie is ſhaken (if
I be not deceiued) namely it is with good reaſons (I truſt) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied,
that <hi>Peter</hi> had that ſupremacie ouer the whole church.
And if he had it not, how can the biſhop of Rome haue it from
him? Againe, we muſt conſider how this hangeth togither. If
<hi>Peter</hi> had that vniuerſall charge, and was biſhop of Rome alſo,
that therefore they that doe ſucceede him in the biſhopricke of
Rome, muſt in like manner that vniuerſall charge.</p>
            <p>But let vs heare M. <hi>Bellarmines</hi> reaſons. But the foure
firſt I of purpoſe omit, bicauſe they are either directed againſt
<hi>Nilus</hi> his opinion,<note place="margin">Li. 2. de Rom. Pontif. cap. 12.</note> who graunted (as maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaieth
of him) that <hi>Peter</hi> had this vniuerſall charge ouer the whole
church, but denieth it to the biſhop of Rome, and therefore thoſe
arguments touch vs little, or elſe they are anſwered before in this
treatiſe. But he hauing proued (after his maner) againſt <hi>Nilus,</hi>
that ſeeing <hi>Peter</hi> had this ſupremacie, hee muſt needes haue a
ſucceſſour in the ſame. At the length he commeth to proue that
the B. of Rome is this his ſucceſſor, reaſoning thus: either the
biſhop of Antioch, or of Rome, muſt be <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſor in the
ſupremacie ouer the whole church. But the biſhop of Antioch can
not chalenge it: therefore Rome muſt ſucceed in this vniuerſall
biſhopricke. That Antioch cannot haue it he ſhews, becauſe <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
reſigned that biſhopricke before he died. I will not here exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min
or cal forth your witneſſes, in what place ye find, that <hi>Peter</hi>
gaue ouer to the biſhop of Antioch which you ſay hee had. But
I will aſke a queſtion of you, by what right he could reſigne it
ouer, and leaue the charge that God committed vnto him, and ſo
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:7294:35"/>
forſake the flocke whereof you are made ouerſeer. You muſt
either holde your peace,<note place="margin">Marcel. epiſt. ad Antioch.</note> or elſe tell vs ſome tale of a baſtarde
Epiſtle of pope <hi>Marcellus,</hi> which commaunded him ſo to
doe.</p>
            <p>And is it inough that <hi>Marcellus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A rotte a prop of ſupermacie.</note> who liued about three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
yeares after this thing was done, ſhould ſay that Chriſt
commaunded him to doe it, and produce no witneſſe, alleadge no
proofe, ſet downe no circumſtances? Thus we ſee that this
ſupremacie doeth ſtande but vpon a tottering foundation. It
may alſo be doubted, whether if he had a vniuerſall charge ouer
the whole church, he might take vpon him a particular charge,
either at Rome, or Antioch. For our Sauiour Chriſt giueth
direction to his Apoſtles, whoſe charge was vniuerſall, Goe

For although it is written of ſome of the Apoſtles, that they

to anſwere maſter <hi>Bellarmines</hi> argument. His <hi>Maior</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
is gathered of a falſe ſuppoſition.<note place="margin">Whether it be needefull that Peter haue a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour.</note> For if it bee not

            <p>But wee denie firſt, that <hi>Peter</hi> himſelfe had this vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall

earth beſides Chriſt, as appeareth out of 1. <hi>Corinthians</hi> and
the twelfth chapter. In which place, after that the Apoſtle
Saint <hi>Paule</hi> hath ſaid, that the church is one body, hee addeth:
The head cannot ſay to the feet, I haue no need of you. Which
his reaſon, if it be drawen into a forme of argument, muſt (as
I thinke) be formed into ſuch a monſtrous ſhape as you haue
ſeene.</p>
            <p>But to omit the ſhape of his argument, let vs ſee what ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce
there is in it. And if it bee examined, it hath as little
found matter,<note place="margin">Anſwere.</note> as good making. For, out of theſe wordes of
Saint <hi>Paule</hi> (the head can not ſay to the feete, I haue no
neede of you) hee thus inferreth, but Chriſt may ſay, that hee
ſtandeth in neede of none of vs: therefore by this head heere
Chriſt can not be meant. Is not this very clarkely handled of
maiſter <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> to apply that vnto Chriſt our head in the
church which S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of the head of a naturall bodie,
whereof he hath borrowed a ſimilitude, to teach how neceſſary
the members of Chriſt his myſticall body, are one to an other,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:7294:36"/>
ſo that none may without wronging himſelfe deſpiſe another?
which collection of M. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is moſt plainely againſt the
text it ſelfe, and the iudgement of all good expoſitours: Nay,
I ſuppoſe I neede except no expoſitor but maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
himſelfe. And yet we haue in that very place an other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his. For a man may ſee that he was ſore pained in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
of this argument. For, ſeeeing no way how to deliuer it
well, he was faine to heape vp much ſtuffe in few lines, (for al
this matter is contained in little more then eight ſhort lines) to
make a ſhew as though he had much to ſay, when as that which
he ſaid is farre worſe then iuſt nothing. Well, let vs view his
argument.<note place="margin">Arg. of bellarm, the 2.</note> One head beſides Chriſt there muſt be, but there is
no other then <hi>Peter:</hi> therefore <hi>Peter</hi> muſt be the head. We flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deny that we need any head but Chriſt, as before I haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
Laſtly,<note place="margin">pag. 6. 12, 13. bellarm. his 3. and laſt argum.</note> 
               <hi>Peter</hi> dying, the church muſt not want a head:
therefore <hi>Peter</hi> muſt haue a ſucceſſor. But this argument ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth
that <hi>Peter</hi> is the head of the vniuerſall church, which
they cannot prooue, and vntill they can prooue it, we will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
our ſelues with Chriſt our head.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee how maſter <hi>Bellarmines</hi> fift argument, as a
plenteous ſpring ſendeth forth three ſtreames, but there is no
cleare water in any of them, but bad couers of a bad meſſe. And
what is all this to the biſhop of Rome, if <hi>Peter</hi> muſt haue a
ſucceſſour? For, as we deny <hi>Peters</hi> ſupremacie, ſo may wee
doubt whether he might be a biſhop, being not an apoſtle only,
as were the reſt, but an apoſtle of the Iewes, whereſoeuer they
were, we doubt of his reſignation of the biſhopricke of Antioch,
if he were at any time biſhop there, we doubt of his being biſhop
of Rome: and laſtly, whether this ſucceſſion muſt needes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to the biſhops of Rome if <hi>Peter</hi> had it: for it might bee
perſonall in <hi>Peter.</hi> And maſter <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who in other que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions
is plentifull of his reaſons, and will make ſome reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
ſhew of proofe in this greateſt matter,<note place="margin">bellarm. barren of reaſons.</note> and which it eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
behoueth him to prooue, is ſo barren, that he hath almoſt
nothing to ſay, no reaſon to alleage, although by his promiſe
he made vs looke for great matters. And yet when all is done,
he muſt either haue vs to graunt him the thing that is in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which we cannot doe, or elſe he can ſay nothing to it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:7294:36"/>
But there are many ſtrong reaſons that moue vs to denie that
<hi>Peter</hi> had any ſuch vniuerſall authoritie ouer all Chriſts flock,<note place="margin">Peter had not charge ouer the whole church.</note>
or that any man, the biſhop of Rome, or any other ſhould haue
ſuch ſupremacie. Firſt the greatneſſe of the change, which is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
far aboue the abilitie of many, much leſſe can any one performe
it. Secondly, that our ſauiour Chriſt doth ſhew a litle before <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
his death,<note place="margin">Chap. 13. 14, 15, 16.</note> as appeareth in Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> goſpell, a fatherly affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and tender care to comfort his diſciples, being penſiue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of his departure, and yet neuer vſeth this argument, or
giueth them this commaundement, that <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould be their
head, and they ſhould obay him. Although good oportunitie
was offered to haue ſpoken of it,<note place="margin">Iohn 16. 7.</note> if it had beene ſo when Chriſt
told them that it was expedient that he ſhould departe. He doth
not then tell them that <hi>Peter</hi> muſt be in his place, and ſupply
his roome, or that one ſhould haue general charge of his church.
But on the contrarie he appointeth his vicar and vicegerent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>

of the church, to comfort, inſtruce, direct, defend, and to do

               <hi>Luke</hi> that writeth the acts of the apoſtles make no mention of

this ſucceſſion, and that perchaunce (for ſo he ſpeaketh to teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
how loth hee is to confeſſe the truth plainly, though he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
denie it) perchance he ſaith it cannot be proued by the lawe
of God, that the biſhop of Rome, as he is biſhop of Rome is
<hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſor. And yet although it cannot be proued to be
decreed by Gods lawe, it is ſaith hee a thing that belongeth to
the catholike faith. For (ſaith hee) to be of the fayth, and to
be by Gods lawe, is not all one, for it is not by Gods lawe
that <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould haue a cloke (hee might haue ſaid as much
alſo for <hi>Tobias</hi> dog) yet this muſt be beleeued. I would not
haue thought that <hi>Pauls</hi> cloke had beene ſuch a neceſſarie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,
but I remember that <hi>Balthaſar Coſſa,</hi> who was pope
<hi>Iohn</hi> the three and twentieth of that name,<note place="margin">Stella Iacob. Bergom.</note> gained well by <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
cloke when time was, for by caſting it vpon his owne
ſhoulders, he made himſelfe pope.</p>
            <p>But can maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> find no better ſtuffe to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
vs to beleeue the popes ſupremacie? They make it
a matter of damnation not to beleeue the ſupremacie of the
pope. And is it of as great neceſſitie to beleeue that <hi>Paul</hi>
had a cloke? If maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> be ſo perſwaded, I la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
his follie. If hee thinke otherwiſe, why doth hee bring
it to prooue that to beleeue the ſupremacie of the biſhop of
Rome, is a pointe of the catholike faith, although by Gods
lawe this ſupremacie cannot be prooued? And as they ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
in ſetting downe by what authoritie right or lawe they
claime this ſoueraigntie: ſo they haue no great proofe for their
manner of this their dignite, whether it be perſonall or not. By
Chriſts firſt inſtitution maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> telleth vs it was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal.</p>
            <p>If Chriſt made it perſonall who could change that eſtate
and make it ſucceſſionall? maſter <hi>Bellmine</hi> anſwereth, that it
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:7294:37"/>
was perſonall, generall, or publike, ſo that it belonged to him
and his ſucceſſors. Whether that can be called perſonall, that is
to ſay belonging to the perſon onely which belongeth alſo to his
ſucceſſours let the indifferent Reader iudge. But how is this
prooued that Chriſt gaue this prerogatiue to him and his?<note place="margin">Li. 1. cap. 12.</note>
Maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith ſo often times, eſpecially in the twelfth
chapter of his firſt booke, but his proofe is litle elſe then his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation.</p>
            <p>Againe, hee ſaieth, that this ſucceſſion is made both per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall
and locall, by <hi>Peters</hi> dying biſhop of Rome. But as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie
I haue proued, that doctrine of <hi>Peters</hi> beeing at Rome
biſhop is not ſo certaine, that chriſtians may build their faith
thereupon: So that we ſee there building is altogether vpon
the ſand, their proofe weake, their reaſons obſcure, and their
places nothing pregnant for that they are brought. And I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
that nowe it ſhould be counted hereſie, not to beleeue the
Romiſh biſhop to be by Gods lawe ſupreame head of the whole
church,<note place="margin">Tom. 2. Luth. fol. 45.</note> ſeeing that in the yeare of our Lord God one thouſand

mind, vnleſſe they ſee better matter then maſter <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>
canne bring, to prooue it to be by Gods lawe. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
hee haue no ſtore of Scripture for him yet hath
hee great hope in councilles and fathers. And I aſſured
my ſelfe that the councilles, if hee will truſt them, will moſt
plainly decide this queſtion, whether that ſuperiority that
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:7294:38"/>
the church of Rome challengeth ouer all other churches, be by
Gods law or mans law, as hereafter it ſhall (if God will) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.
Nowe therefore to examine maiſter <hi>Bellarmines</hi> next
proofe which is out of the counſels.<note place="margin">Lib. 1. cap 13.</note> And the firſt counſel that he
alleageth, is the Nicen counſel, not that which themſelues haue
deliuered to vs as authenticall and true, in the tomes of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
ſet foorth by themſelues: but to ſerue this turne, we muſt
haue a new addition, and a ſtrange interpretation not that which
agreeth beſt with the words,<note place="margin">Bellar. arg. out of the Nicen counſel Canon. 6.</note> and is thought moſt true of them
that liued neare vnto the daies of that counſell. Firſt therefore
we muſt adde (ſaith maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi>) to the beginning of
the ſixt canon, the church of Rome alwaies had the ſupremacy.
And why muſt thoſe wordes be added? <hi>Paſchaſinus</hi> forſooth a
biſhop in the counſell of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> did ſo cite that canon.<note place="margin">Action. 16, The biſhop of Rome a forgerer.</note> He
did ſo, but he was legate for <hi>Leo</hi> then biſhop of Rome that did
alleadge it, &amp; by <hi>Aetius</hi> Archdeacon of Conſtantinople he was
diſproued, who read not onely the coppy of the canon, by a alſo
the approbation of the ſame counſell, and canon, by a counſell
holden at Conſtantinople, of 150. biſhops, <hi>Nectarius</hi> being bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
there.</p>
            <p>But one found out a greeke coppy of that counſellong ſince
and in that ſaith maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> thoſe wordes are. If the
coppies that we haue, haue thus long beene thought true and
good, I ſee no reaſon why for ſome one greeke coppy, which
might very well be falſified by ſome fauorite of the church of
Rome, we ſhould diſcredit that which hath ſo long beene recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued:
eſpecially ſeeing the counſell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> the matter on
both ſides being diſcuſſed and heard, did giue vnto the church of
Conſtantinople as great priuiledges as the church of Rome
had. Which they woulde not haue done, but that they ſawe
<hi>Paſchaſinus</hi> his allegation, for his maiſter the biſhop of Rome
(for he was one of his legates) to be forged. Nay if that
Rome had gotten this prerogatiue by Gods lawe, as nowe
the papiſtes teach,<note place="margin">Canon. 6.</note> without wickedneſſe they coulde not haue
done it.</p>
            <p>Then theſe words of that canon of the Nicen council (<hi>Becauſe
the biſhop of Rome hath ſuch like cuſtome</hi>) muſt alſo haue
a newe interpretation, For whereas <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> who liued, if
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:7294:38"/>
not in, yet very neare the dayes of the <hi>Nicene</hi> councill, doeth
plainely expound,<note place="margin">Hiſt. li. 1. cap. 6.</note> howe in thoſe dayes they tooke the ſence
and meaning of thoſe wordes, namely, that the Biſhoppe of
Rome ſhould haue cure of the churches that belonged to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs
thereof: Maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> that commeth many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds
of yeares after, will in no wiſe like of that expoſition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he imagineth it to be too narrow a compaſſe for the proud
pope.<note place="margin">Other maner of Popes in thoſe dayes then now we haue.</note> But hee muſt remember, that when theſe limittes were
appointed vnto him, the Biſhops, not of Rome onely, but of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
places alſo, were other manner of men, than now they are
for the moſt part. And it ſeemeth that theſe limittes were laide
vpon them, rather as a burden, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſought and ſued for as an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
            <p>And that the godly and learned men, who ſought eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the good of the church, did cauſe this diuiſion of thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to be made, for the better keeping of vnitie in the church, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing
vnto euery one of theſe primates or patriarches, ſuch
to bee in ſome reſpect vnder their charge, as they ſawe were
(for ſuch conſiderations as were beſt knowen vnto them) moſt
likely to ſhew themſelues willing to be ruled by them. Yea. and
the leſſe compaſſe or circuite of iuriſdiction might perchaunce
bee appoynted to the Biſhop of Rome, becauſe that thorowe
great recourſe of people of all places vnto that Citty, beeing
the imperiall Citty, hee was ſo troubled with many matters
of al mens, that he might not ſo well intend and looke to a great
charge of his owne.</p>
            <p>And I knowe not why maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſhould ſo alter
as hee doth the worde <hi>parilis</hi> into <hi>talis,</hi> but to gaine as much
credite as he can to his interpretation. For, <hi>parlis conſuetudo</hi>
which are the wordes vſed by the Councill,<note place="margin">Bellar. changeth the words of the canon.</note> is an equall cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome,
and hath reſpect to that which is ſaide of the Biſhop of
Alexandria. So that this is the meaning of thoſe wordes, that
<hi>Egypt, Lybia,</hi> and <hi>Pentapolis,</hi> ſhould be vnder the Biſhop of
<hi>Alexandria,</hi> becauſe the Biſhop of Rome hath ſuch like cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome,
or a cuſtome equall to that. But the expoſition that
maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would haue to ſtand for good, is, that
the biſhop of Rome had ſuch a cuſtome to appoint the Biſhop of
<hi>Alexandria</hi> thoſe limittes, which interpretation howe forced it
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:7294:39"/>
is, how it cannot aptly be gathered out of the words of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill,
I referre it to the indifferent Reader to conſider. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
this word <hi>parilis</hi> equall cuſtome, will not ſtand with
Maiſter <hi>Bellarmines</hi> ſenſe, he truneth it away, and in ſteede
thereof would vſe a word more indifferent for him. And ſo (good
Reader) thou mayeſt ſee how Maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> moſt abſurd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reiecteth the plaine and old interpretation of this canon which
<hi>Ruffinus</hi> affordeth vs, and would haue vs beleeue a new gloſe
of his owne, that muſt quite alter the ſenſe, and adde much
to the wordes of the text it ſelfe. And yet when antiquitie ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
their turne: none crie out for Antiquitie more than they.
They go about to diſcredite our doctrine, becauſe it is newe
onely, and yet theirs we ſee here, is both new and naught, and
yet are not they aſhamed to bragge, that all that they teach is
catholike.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Councill alleaged by Maiſter <hi>Bellarmine,</hi>

the Councill of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> of which hee ſaieth out of
<hi>Theodoret,</hi> that they came together in that place by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement
of the Popes letters ſent to them by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.
The more I reade Maiſter <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> the more I find
and miſlike his euill dealing, who handleth Gods cauſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſincerely, but walketh in the ſame (as in this his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
may eaſily appeare) with a deceitfull heart. For firſt to
make the matter ſeeme more plaine on his ſide then in deede it
is, hee ſaith, that they came to Conſtantinople at the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
of the Popes letters: but <hi>Theodoret</hi> ſpeaketh nothing
of any commaundement, but vpon the Popes letter. The like
alſo is in the letters themſelues that are ſet downe in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill.
For it ſeemeth that <hi>Damaſus,</hi> whether it were vpon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
he had to chriſtian vnity, and agreement in religion, or elſe
becauſe he ſawe the emperour <hi>Theodoſius</hi> bent to haue a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill,
and he was perchance deſirous to ſeeme to haue ſome ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in that matter, or for any other conſideration whatſoeuer,
wrote vnto the Emperour about a Councill. But if the Pope
might haue called a Councill, hee woulde then haue directed
his commaundements vnto the Biſhoppes to aſſemble, not to
the emperor, what theſe letters were it is not knowen. If they
were to require and intreate the emperour to call a Councill, it
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:7294:39"/>
maketh nothing for proofe of maſter <hi>Bellarmines</hi> argument, or
the popes power. If it were to commaund the emperour to ſend
his letters to them, or to cauſe them to be ſummoned, it were in
deede ſomewhat like vnto the ſawcy and vnmannerly writings
of theſe prowd prelates of our time, but then neither the Pope
burſt ſo to commaund, neither the emperour did owe, or would
performe any ſuch ſeruice or duety to him. But the report of
the Councill it ſelfe (as it is deliuered vnto vs by themſelues,_
doth ſufficiently declared that all was done in that councill,<note place="margin">Concil, tom. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. The emperour had all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding in that councill.</note> at
the commaundement of the emperour. Firſt, he commaunded
that the Biſhops ſhould come out of euery biſhopricke to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,
as he that gathered the councils together teacheth
out of <hi>Theodoret.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hiſt. li. 5. ca. 6.</note> The emperour deſired them to haue a care
of that they had in hand. And out of <hi>Socrates</hi> he ſheweth, that
the emperour called alſo the Macedonian heretickes, becauſe he
had good hope that they alſo might be vnited, to the Church.</p>
            <p>Moreouer out of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> that the emperour conſulted
with <hi>Nectarius,</hi> what courſe were beſt for quietneſſe in the
church, they came to the emperour to take ſome good order in
theſe matters, he queſtioned with the heretikes, concerning the
the triall of the matters in queſtion: he tooke order that both
partes ſhould ſet downe their minde in writing, hee tooke that
they had written, prayed earneſtly to God to direct him to chuſe
the truth, tore the writings of the heretickes, allowed or recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
onely that docrine that taught the equalitie of the perſons.
He alſo allowed the Nouatians their churches in the city, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they were in this point conſtant. And out of <hi>Sozomen,</hi>
that the emperour made a lawe, that heretickes ſhoulde neither
haue churches, neither be permitted to preach of the faith (a
good lawe to be earneſtly thought vpon and practiſed in theſe
our dayes) nor ordaine biſhops or others. All theſe things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſet downe in the Bookes of Councils, by them deliuered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs, who can thinke that Maſter <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who alleadgeth
this Councill for ſtrength of his cauſe (and that falſely alſo)
wherein all things are ſo direct againſt him, would ſee the truth,
if it were neuer ſo plaine before him. The third councill is that
which was aſſembled at Epheſus, &amp; that alſo M. <hi>Bellar.</hi> (belike

            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:7294:40"/>
The third Councill (ſaith he) as <hi>Euagrius</hi> doth witneſſe,
ſaith that it depoſeth <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> by the commaundement of
<hi>Caeleſtine</hi> biſhop of Rome. How now maſter <hi>Bellarmine,</hi>
haue you quite fallen out with truth, and made a league with
falſhood?<note place="margin">Yet more fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoode in Bellar.</note> haue you purpoſed ſtill to abuſe your reader, by moſt
ſhameleſſe affirming that which is not true? The counſell ſaid,
we, by the neceſſitie aſwel of the canons, as alſo of the epiſtle of
the moſt holy father, our felow miniſter <hi>Celeſtine</hi> biſhop of
Rome compelled &amp;c. Where is this that maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
affirmeth? <hi>Celeſtine</hi> biſhop of Rome wrote perchance to ſhew
his deteſtation of the hereſie of <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> and they willing to
doe him that honour, that they would ſeeme much to eſteeme
of his zeale in faith, that beeing ſo farre diſtant in place, he
would be vnited as it were to them in their iudgement againſt
<hi>Neſtorius,</hi> they ſhew that they were mooued much by his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and incouraged to proceede againſt <hi>Neſtorius.</hi> But here
is no word of any commaundement that he gaue them, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the contrarie. For they call him their felow miniſter, and
ſo acknowledge not him to be a commaunder ouer them. Yea
and in a mandate to <hi>Philip</hi> prieſt, vicar or vicegerent to <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtine</hi>
then biſhop of Rome, and others ſent to Conſtantinople,
they tell the popes vicar plainly, and his felowes thus: Wee
will your holineſſe to vnderſtand, that if you deſpiſe any of theſe
things, neither this holy ſynode will ratifie it, neither ſhall
you be permitted to be pertaker of our communion. Yea and
before, that council directeth euen the popes legate and the reſt,
that if the emperour ſent for them, they muſt in any wiſe be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient
to his commaundement, and muſt not refuſe to goe,
(which doctrine were hereſie in our dayes) but they ſhould not
agree with <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Antioch</hi> and the reſt, but vpon ſuch condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
as (not the pope) the council did ſet them downe, vpon
the paine aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>And that this Councill was aſſembled by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
is in many places declared: as out of <hi>Euagrius</hi> that
it was at the appointment of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the younger, and
after by the commaundement of the moſt religious Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.
The like is alſo teſtified, in the ſuperſcription of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
mandate, that I haue ſpoken of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:7294:40"/>
And it is alſo worth noting that the councill writing to the
Emperours, for the credite of their councill, doeth not vrge
that the pope is head there (but indeede they craue that <hi>Cirill</hi>
and <hi>Memnon,</hi> not <hi>Cirill</hi> onely whom they ſay the pope <hi>Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi>
deputed for him be reſtored to them again that their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill
be not without a head) but they ſay that <hi>Celeſtine</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
of Rome,<note place="margin">Pag. 588.</note> doth ſit ioyned with them there, he doth <hi>aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere</hi>
ſit I ſay with them, not <hi>praeſidet,</hi> he ruleth not, he cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troleth
not the councill, and ſo it is alſo ſaid of <hi>Aphrica</hi> and
<hi>Illyricum</hi> that they <hi>aſſident</hi> ſit with the councill. And out of
this that hath beene ſpoken as alſo by ſuch other thinges as in
that councill are recorded, we may gather what truth is in that
alſo, that maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> alleadgeth of an Epiſtle ſent by
the councill to <hi>Celeſtine,</hi> reſeruing the cauſe of <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och</hi>
as more doubtfull to be decided by the biſhoppe of Rome.
But as I finde not any ſuch Epiſtle in that councill, ſo this is
plainely written, in the report that the councill maketh of their
doings to the Emperours, that they excommunicated <hi>Iohn</hi> (of
<hi>Antioch</hi>) the preſident of the Apoſtatas councill,<note place="margin">Pag. 588.</note> and them that
were with him: and depriued them of all prieſtly miniſtery,
and reuoked all their vnlawfull doings. If this be to referre
his cauſe to the pope, let the world iudge.</p>
            <p>Then he commeth to the council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The fourth Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill alleadged by Bellarmine.</note> and that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
for him too, if we wil truſt him; but in examining it, we ſhal
finde it much like the reſt, directly againſt the ſupremacy of the
biſhop of Rome.<note place="margin">Act. 1.</note> For firſt in the beginning of that councill it is
declared that it is gathered by the decree of the moſt godly and
faithfull Emperours <hi>Valentinian</hi> and <hi>Martian</hi> who alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth
that he deſired to be there to confirme the faith,<note place="margin">Pag. 740.</note> wherein
were iudges appointed to moderate their doings and ſayings,
and to conclude their articles, not the pope, or his legates,
(for they as it appeareth in this councill, were at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement
of theſe iudges, as well as others, but lay men,
officers vnder the Emperour. It will be hard then for maiſter
<hi>Bellarmine,</hi> in reſpect of ſome fewe excellent names that may
be giuen to <hi>Leo</hi> biſhop of Rome, whereof alſo it may be he
was worthy in reſpect of ſome good parts that were in him, it
will I ſay bee harde, by ſuch names, to proue his ſupremacie
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:7294:41"/>
by this councell, which hath almoſt done what it can, in preiudice
of any ſuch prerogatiue that he might claime.<note place="margin">The councell of Chalcedon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy.</note> For if it belong
not to him to call councils, neither to rule in them when they

in this councell both theſe things are done by others, and not by
him.</p>
            <p>But what doth Maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> finde in this councill for
the popes ſupremacy?<note place="margin">Bellarm, his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons out of this councill. Lib. 1. cap. 12.</note> That in that, the pope <hi>Leo</hi> is called the

little before, (perchance that maketh him more perfect in it) ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that three letters are ſent from the Eaſt church to <hi>Leo</hi> biſhop
of Rome, and in them all he is called the pope of the vniuerſall
church, there are indeede foure ſuch letters euen togither, to the
biſhop of Rome, and the councill of Chalcedon, and in none of
them is he called the pope of the vniuerſall church, but only the
vniuerſall archbiſhop or patriarch.</p>
            <p>But there is a great difference betweene a vniuerſall biſhop,
and a biſhop of the vniuerſall church.<note place="margin">Act. 3. pag. 858.</note> But ſuch miſſes are ſmal
faults, with maſter <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> Indeede <hi>Paſchaſinus</hi> the popes

of Nice to procure the ſupremacie vnto his maiſter, and therfore
we muſt not ground our faith vpon his wordes. But for that
name of vniuerſall biſhop which is often giuen to the biſhop of
Rome,<note place="margin">Vniuerſall biſhop not only the popes name.</note> it is not yet a name peculiar to him, as a great friende of
theirs,<note place="margin">Annal. An. 187.</note> and at this day in great account among them, doth tell
them, namely <hi>Caeſar Baronius</hi> in his hiſtory. For out of him
they may learne that <hi>Eleutherius</hi> a pope himſelfe, in a decretall
epiſtle of his, written to the biſhops of <hi>France,</hi> calleth them vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall
biſhops,<note place="margin">Epiſt. ad Philad.</note> as <hi>Ignatius</hi> calleth the biſhop of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi>
the biſhop of the common church, and ſo <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi>
ſpeaketh of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> biſhop of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> Which <hi>Baroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
ſeemeth thus to vnderſtand, that they ought to haue a care (as
indeed euery man ſhould haue) of the good of the whole church.
And theſe names of head of the church,<note place="margin">To whom theſe names belong.</note> vniuerſall biſhop, and
ſuch like, were doubtleſſe at the firſt graunted to ſuch as were
moſt worthy men in the church, in reſpect of their learning and
ſkill that they had, or their trauell and diligence that they vſed,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:7294:41"/>
to benefit the vniuerſall Church. And by this meanes, was it
more commonly giuen to the biſhops of Rome then to others,
becauſe they, in regard of the place or city wherein they were,
had moe occaſions of doing good offered vnto them, and moe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities,
by reaſon of his neereneſſe to the Emperour, to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licite
ſuch matters.</p>
            <p>And in this ſorte is it giuen for a rewarde of well deſeruing,
and to incourage them that were able,<note place="margin">How theſe names are now vſed.</note> to doe their vttermoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour,
to benefit the church. But now it is a name tied to one
chaire, in which for the moſt part doe ſit of the vnworthieſt men
that are in the church. So that if a man conſider howe little
good they doe in the church, and how much hurt, wee ſhall thinke
that a ring of gold will better become a ſowes ſnowt, then they
beſeeme that honourable title, or it them. And as for that which
the councill doth write vnto <hi>Leo,</hi> ſaying, that he is appointed of
our Sauiour to keepe his vine, they ſpeake it not in reſpect of
his being biſhop of Rome, but in conſideration of his excellent
giftes of learning and other good graces, wherewith God hath
indued him. And that this is their meaning it doth plainely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,
by thoſe things that afterwardes in that councill they did.
For if they had meant by thoſe wordes,<note place="margin">Act. 16.</note> that he, as biſhoppe of
Rome, had ſupremacy ouer the whole church, then woulde they
not haue giuen vnto the biſhop of Conſtantinople, equall priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
with Rome, and ſo haue taken from Rome, that which
Chriſt gaue (as they pretend) to the biſhop thereof. Thus to
be ſhort, in this one councill, we ſee this ſupremacy had three no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
checkes. It was called by the Emperours, and modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by lay Iudges, and the biſhop of Conſtantinople made e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
to him of Rome.</p>
            <p>The fift councill that is heere alleadged,<note place="margin">The fift councell alleadged by Bellarm.</note> is the fifth Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople
councill. But this can bring litle credite to their
cauſe, ſeeing it may iuſtly be doubted, whether euer there were
any ſuch or not. For beſides that miſtruſt which the very title of
that councill, which is in the ſecond tombe of Councils doth
worke in them that reade it,<note place="margin">Concil. tom. 2.</note> becauſe it cannot be ſet downe when,
or in what popes dayes it was celebrated, but that it was about
the time of <hi>Agapetus, Siluerius,</hi> and <hi>Vigilius:</hi> I ſay beſides
the vncertainety of it that there appeareth,<note place="margin">Anno. 552.</note> 
               <hi>Functius</hi> one ſkilfull
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:7294:42"/>
in hiſtories hath noted, that this is not once ſpoken of in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople
hiſtories. And therefore it is not likely that any ſuch
councell, was kept there. Neither yet can the reſt of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
alleadged by maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſtande him in any ſteede.
For we will not deny, but after that once the pope had gotten in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that proud chaire, almoſt all did yeeld vnto him honour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence,
ſome for feare,<note place="margin">Later councels are not in this cauſe indifferent.</note> ſome for flattery, vntill they had made
him little inferiour to God himſlfe. And therefore wee iuſtly
reiect the councels that were gathered ſince his power was ſo
greate, and his pride ſo vntollerable, that by ſome meanes or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hee would be honoured as himſelfe thought good. And
therefore the ſecond councell of Nice which was about the yeare
ſeuen hundred eighty nine, the lateran about the yeare one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
two hundred and fifteene. That of Lions about the yeare
one thouſand two hundred ſeuenty and foure, and that of Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
about the yeare one thouſand foure hundred thirty nine, are
no fit witneſſes againſt vs, who doe not deny but that the Pope
ſometime by faire meanes, ſometime by foule, ſometime by flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
ſometime by threatning, ſometime by force, ſometime by
craft, and alwaies by euill dealing, hath gotten to bee in ſorte as
yee ſee, ſupreame head of the Church.</p>
            <p>But we ſay that he is not ſo by the word of God, which hee
claimeth to be, and maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> promiſed to proue, but
he cannot doe it. Neither was he accounted in the purer times of
the Church, to haue that ſupremacy by Gods word, as before I
haue ſpoken.<note place="margin">Pag. 14.</note> Neither would they in any wiſe permit ſuch pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
vnto him, although he ſought it earneſtly, and ſhamefullie in
the councell of Chalcedon.<note place="margin">Act. 16.</note> After the councels maiſter <hi>Bellarmin</hi>

men then many of them were, are not to be heard in their owne

were profitable members in Chriſtes church, yet becauſe they
were men, they might haue ſuch infirmities as doe follow the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of man, and might (eſpecially not ſeeing the inconuenience
and ruine of the church, which the pride of that ſeate hath brought
forth) aſcribe more vnto their owne ſeate, then either in truth
they could claime, or in chriſtian humility they could take vpon
them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:7294:42"/>
And for the firſt popes, which all they that write of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
recken vp in great numbers, I truſt we ſhal not hereafter bee
troubled with their names, becauſe maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
them a reaſonable good diſcharge.<note place="margin">Lib. 2. cap. 14.</note> For he confeſſeth that
in their writings there are ſome errours, neither dare he affirme
that they may not be doubted of: and as for the reſt of them,
becauſe wee haue ſeene euen almoſt from the beginning of any
credite that they had, ſome ſparkes of their pride, now and then
to glitter and burſt forth in their importunate ſeeking, or too rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
accepting of that that belonged not to them: as in equity we
are not bound, ſo neither in diſcretion ſhould we, when the cauſe
concerneth not vs, but Gods truth, heare what they can ſay for
themſelues, againſt the ſame. Neither are their writings for the
moſt part any ſuch, as that by them wee may iudge throughlie
what they did thinke.<note place="margin">What maner of writings of popes are alleadged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs.</note> For epiſtles or letters (ſuch are thoſe wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings

ſundry particular occaſions written, whereby the writers
might happely be forced to ſay more for the credite of that ſeate,
then themſelues would haue ſaid, if that occaſion had not beene

otherwiſe, and more plainely in that point, then doe the other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
writers of their time, and that maketh me thinke that they
did ſpeake for themſelues, and were ſomewhat pricked forward,
with a purpoſe to aduance their ſeat.<note place="margin">Bellarm. proofe out of Greeke fathers. Lib. 2. cap. 15. Inſcript. Epiſt. ad Rom. Ignatius anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> Therefore letting them
paſſe as partiall in this cauſe, let vs come to this next proofe,
which is out of the greeke fathers.</p>
            <p>And firſt commeth in <hi>Ignatius</hi> who writeth to the church that
ruleth (for I will admit the worſt that Maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> or
any other can alleadge ont of this place) in the Romane region.
But will Maiſter <hi>Bellarmines</hi> logicke conclude that therefore
the church of Rome hath ſupremacy ouer the whole church? He
muſt firſt bring the vniuerſall church within the place of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
region before that can be Out of <hi>Ireny</hi> he hath theſe words.<note place="margin">Lib. 3. cap. 3.</note>
For vnto this church for the more mighty principality (ſpeaking
of the church of Rome) it is neceſſary that the whole church doe
come,<note place="margin">Ireny exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> that is the faithful from al places, in which alwaies of them
that are from all places, is kept that tradition which is from the
Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:7294:43"/>
The wordes as you may ſee are ſomewhat hard, by reaſon that
he who tranſlated <hi>Ireny</hi> out of greeke, did here, as in many other
places tranſlate him very darkely. But I haue engliſhed them
word for word. His meaning is, that they that come from other
places of the world, be it neuer ſo farre off, yet doe not alter the
tradition that the apoſtles left vnto them, and yet many muſt
needes come thither, becauſe that in reſpect that Rome is the
Imperiall citty, the church alſo hath the more mighty principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and ſo in deciding of cauſes hath the more reuerence and
authority. And thus doth he proue that to be true, that in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of that chapter he ſaid, that it is an eaſie matter for him
(that will) to ſee the tradition of the apoſtles manifeſted through
the whole world, becauſe that from whence ſoeuer they do come,
yet ſtill they keepe one tradition.</p>
            <p>By this argument doth <hi>Ireny</hi> confute the heretikes, becauſe
the tradition of the apoſtles being kept in all places (not only in
the church of Rome although becauſe it was beſt known, or moſt
famous, he bringeth that for example) yet no ſuch doctrine as the
heretikes ſpeake of, is taught among them. But nowe maiſter
<hi>Bellarmines</hi> vnſeaſonable collection out of this place, is very
farre from <hi>Irenies</hi> meaning. That it is neceſſary (ſaith he) that
all churches ſhould hang of the church of Rome. He proueth
firſt by that which goeth before, becauſe principality is giuen to
this church: ſecondly of that which followeth, becauſe hitherto al
in that church haue kept the faith that is in being vnited,<note place="margin">Bellarm. arg. out of Ireny exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</note> and clea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning
to that church, as the head and mother. Theſe are maiſter
<hi>Bellarmines</hi> words. But firſt he ſaith wrong of <hi>Ireny</hi> that he
ſhould indeuour to proue ſuch neceſſity in comming to the church
of Rome, eſpeciall taking, as here he doth for a bounden duty.
For it is maiſter <hi>Bellarmines</hi> meaning to make the church of
Rome, the onely church that muſt heare all great matters, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide
all doubtfull queſtions, and commande all other churches.
But <hi>Ireny</hi> his meaning is, that all other men had occaſion, to
ſeeke rather of that church then of any other for helpe and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
becauſe that in reſpect of the greatnes of the citty, the church
there was in ſome greater accompt, as before I haue ſhewed,
but he neuer ſaide that all were bound to ſubmit themſelues to
that church,<note place="margin">Dog. 83.</note> as maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and his partakers, would
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:7294:43"/>
haue him be thought to ſpeake. Secondly he muſt ſpeake more
plainely what he meaneth by this, that principality is giuen to
the church of Rome.<note place="margin">Principality in I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reny how to bee vnderſtood.</note> For if he meane that men yeeld great reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to the church of Rome, we yeelde that in the primitiue
church they did ſo, &amp; that iuſtly, becauſe the true faith was there
ſincerely kept, but this principality will not pleaſe maiſter <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine,</hi>
or proue his intent. And if <hi>Ireny</hi> had meant that this
principality had beene giuen by Chriſt, a man of meane vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
will eaſily thinke that he would haue ſpoken it in more
plaine tearmes.</p>
            <p>But what neede I to vſe many words? the place it ſelfe is
plaine. For the more mighty principality (ſaith <hi>Ireny,</hi>) if he
had thought of the ſupremacy of the biſhop of Rome, he would
haue ſaid moſt mighty principality. For more mighty princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality
doth but make him better then others in ſome reſpect, not
aboue all others which he claimeth to be. So that to proue his
intent he muſt haue better proofe. For this will not warrant
that ſoueraigne authority of the biſhop of Rome. Thirdly, that
which maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would tell vs out of this place, that
all churches muſt be vnited and cleaue to this church of Rome,
as their head &amp; mother, hath at all no ground of <hi>Irenies</hi> words.
And thus we ſee howe he doth racke and rent the wordes out of
their plaine ſence, to ſerue for his purpoſe, which being wel wei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of, make rather againſt them, and their ſupremacy. <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
is his third witnes,<note place="margin">Hereſ. 68. Epiphanius exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</note> who reporteth that <hi>Vrſarius</hi> and <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens</hi>
two <hi>Arrian</hi> biſhops being conuerted, did go to <hi>Iulius</hi> bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of Rome, to giue an accompt of their errour and fault.
But if that proue the ſupremacy of the biſhop of Rome, then
muſt <hi>Athanaſius</hi> alſo haue that ſupremacy as well as he, for it
followeth immediatly after, that they vſed the ſelfe ſame proofes
that they repented of their errour vnto <hi>Athanaſius.</hi> So that the
intent and cauſe of their going to pope <hi>Iulius,</hi> or pope <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi>
(for he is there ſo called) was not to acknowledge his ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,
but as it was known that they had erred, ſo woulde they
haue it well knowen that they reuoked their hereſie. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did they craue pardon of their offence,<note place="margin">Athan. Apolog. 2.</note> of <hi>Iulius</hi> biſhop of
Rome (which out of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> he endeuoured to proue) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he had authority ouer all perſons, but becauſe they knew
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:7294:44"/>
their offence to haue beene againſt the whole church, they were
deſirous that the biſhop of Rome for his parte, as a principall
member of the church but not a head aboue all, ſhould not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
that fault vnto them. And this is the part of euery chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
man or woman, hauing made a generall fault, whereby ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
godly are offeuded, to make alſo a publike ſatiſfaction for the
ſame. And cannot this be done to pope <hi>Iulius,</hi> but we muſt make
him head of the church? <hi>Athanaſius</hi> alſo his letter to pope <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix</hi>
is alleadged,<note place="margin">Athanaſ. epiſt. to Felix pope. Bellarm. argu. out of Athan. exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> wherein <hi>Athanaſius</hi> being much diſtreſſed of
the <hi>Arrians,</hi> and wrongfully dealt withall, and not hauing any
hope that the greeke Church coulde helpe him, the Emperour
himſelfe being an <hi>Arrian,</hi> the rather to mooue the biſhoppe of
Rome to pity his caſe ſaith thus. For this cauſe God hath pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
you and your predeceſſours Apoſtolicke prelates, in the
towre of height, and hath charged you to haue care of all chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
that you ſhould helpe vs. That God by meanes of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine
and other good Emperours, aduanced high the Biſhop
of Rome we deny not. And we alſo knowe, that thoſe good bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
did much good with that their authority to the church of
God, and were a great reliefe to the oppreſſed, a comforte to the
troubled, and a good ſtay for religion. We yeeld moreouer that a
care ouer the whole church a belongeth not to the biſhop of Rome
only,<note place="margin">Annal. Ann. 187.</note> but to euery chriſtian, as <hi>Baronius</hi> a papiſt telleth vs. And
as Saint <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith of himſelfe, although hee were not an vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall
Biſhop, or pope ouer all the church, yt that he had a care
ouer all the Churches.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 11. 28.</note> Which care as it ſhoulde be in all, yet
it ſhould be greateſt in them, whom God hath beautified with
greateſt graces of power, wiſedome, knowledge, credite or any
other thing, whereby they may doe good to others. So that the
effect of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> his wordes vnto <hi>Felix</hi> is, that as God
hath inabled him, ſo alſo he ſhould apply his greatneſſe to doe
him good.</p>
            <p>We doe not yet ſee the Biſhop of Rome to haue iuriſdiction
ouer the whole church, but that the greatneſſe that hee hath, hee
ſhould vſe it to the comfort of the godly. But indeede the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of Rome in ſteed of the care that he ſhould haue, doth exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
the power that he hath.</p>
            <p>And the excerciſing of his power beganne ſomewhat ſoone in
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:7294:44"/>
that chaire. And therefore the fathers in the ſixt council of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi>
as it ſeemeth, were moued in the canons of the Nicen
council to alter one worde. For hauing agreed in the ninth
canon or chapter of that council of <hi>Carthage</hi> to heare the Nicen
decrees read, when they come to the ſixt chapter, where the
Nicen council hath, that the biſhop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> ſhould hane
power ouer the churches of <hi>Lybia, Egipt,</hi> &amp; <hi>Pentapolis,</hi> as the
biſhop of Rome hath within his libertie,<note place="margin">Care for power.</note> in ſteede of the word
power, they read care? Which no doubt thoſe godly fathers
did, becauſe they ſawe how immoderately, and by what bad
ſhifts, they did then ſeeke to bring vnder their ſubiection all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
And therefore by this meanes they would teach them to
whome they did graunt ſuch honorable places, that they were
called rather to a burden, then to an honour, to looke vnto their
charge, rather then to ouer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ooke them. So then this care that
the biſhop of Rome ſhould haue ouer all churches we wiſh alſo
that hee would haue. And yet we doe not hereby make him,
the biſhop of the vniuerſall church.<note place="margin">De ſententia Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onyſ. Alex. epiſc.</note> And for the third place out
of <hi>Athanatius,</hi> it hath leſſe waight then any of the reſt. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſome accuſed the biſhop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> to the biſhop of

but accuſations are for the moſt priuat.<note place="margin">Accuſations prooue no iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</note> And who can hinder but
that any may make complaint to a man that hath nothing to doe

as will be willing to heare all matters, as were many of the B.
of Rome,<note place="margin">Epiſt. 52. Bellarm. argum. out of Baſil.</note> to increaſe their owne power. That which is alea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
out of <hi>Baſil,</hi> is a requeſt that <hi>Baſil</hi> did purpoſe to make to
the biſhop of Rome, like vnto that which <hi>Athanaſius</hi> made to
<hi>Felix,</hi> and therefore one anſwere doth ſerue them both. But
in that epiſtle <hi>Baſil</hi> calleth <hi>Athanaſius</hi> the <hi>Top of all chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
which name they would faine ſhould be peculiar to their

            <p>And that that is alleaged out of <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> in the firſt place
is not much material, becauſe <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> maketh that requeſt
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:7294:45"/>
to the B. of the weſt church, and not to Innocentius alone. Yea,
&amp; not <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> only in the ſame his epiſtle, but <hi>Socrates</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
in his hiſtorie teſtifieth, that <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> appealed from his
aduerſaries (not to the pope which he would doubtleſſe haue
done, if hee had taken his authoritie to haue beene ſuch, as now
the church of Rome would haue it imagined) but to the generall
council. And not hee onely appealed to a council, but the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
alſo were readie to make a tumult for him, and ſaid it was
meete the matter ſhould be heard (not by the pope) but in a
generall council.<note place="margin">Epiſt. 2. ad In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent.</note> Secondly out of <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> he alleageth
theſe words, we alwayes thanke you, for that you haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
vnto vs your fatherly good will. What will the chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
affection of the pope, prooue him to be head of the whole
church? If it will not, this will doe no good, his third place is
this,<note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> I intreate your watchfullneſſe, that although they haue
filled all with tumults: yet if they will haue their deſeaſe
healed, they be neither afflicted, neither put out of mens com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie.</p>
            <p>Muſt the biſhop of Rome bee the ſupreame head, or elſe
this requeſt be in vaine? He being, as it is alwaies confeſſed, of
great authoritie, (although not ſo great as they imagine) might
either by intreating, or by authority winne many to be of his
minde, and ſo hinder the excommunication of <hi>Chryſoſtomes</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries.
So that none of theſe arguments can conclude for
the popes ſupremacie as we ſee. And yet they wring whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
is ſaid or done to the church of Rome,<note place="margin">Why the Eaſt churches ſought to the Weſt.</note> as if it were a ſtrong
proofe for ſupremacie. Whereas the godly of the eaſt church
being thus diſtreſſed, were in policie forced (and not for religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
cauſes) to ſeeke for helpe of the Weſt church, and of the
biſhop of Rome for their owne quietneſſe. And this doth appeare
moſt plainly, in an epiſtle that <hi>Baſil</hi> writeth vnto the biſhop of
the weſt church for their helpe,<note place="margin">Epiſt. 61.</note> and eſpecially by the aduiſe that
hee giueth to <hi>Athanaſius</hi> to that end, wherein hee ſheweth
that there is no way for their ſafetie, but to cauſe the biſhops
of the Weſt church to take good parte with them. And then
if they chance to ſeeke for this at the popes hand,<note place="margin">Epiſt. 48.</note> by and
by without all doubt hee muſt be head of the church. It
maketh me weary euen but to reade their arguments. They
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:7294:45"/>
doe ſo force their authorities that they bring, and ſo vnnaturally

            <p>And heere before I goe any further this one note I thinke
neceſſary to be added, concerning many of the former teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.<note place="margin">Marke what writings the church of Rome alleadgeth for her ſupremacy.</note>
That becauſe they are drawen from the priuate Epiſtles
of men diſtreſſed, ſeeking for helpe, and therefore they might wel
be forced to write with as great humility as they could deuiſe to
write, for to obtaine ſuccour: it is no reaſon that theſe their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
petitions, and priuate requeſts, ſhould be accounted as rules
for catholicke religion.<note place="margin">Lib. 3. cap. 8. Sozomen exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</note> Then commeth in <hi>Sozomen</hi> in which he
miſtaketh both the place (alleadging the ſeuenth chapter for the
eighth an errour eaſily committed) and the matter. For although
<hi>Iulius</hi> biſhop of Rome, did thinke well of the dignity of his ſeat,
yea and in reſpect of his mightineſſe that hee was now growen
vnto, partly by the goodneſſe of former Emperours, but chiefly
through the diſſentions of the eaſt or greeke churches, hee was
in duty alſo bound more then others to haue a great care ouer all
churches: yet that his ſupremacy was not then acknowledged
that very Chapter ſhall ſufficiently teſtifie. For there it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
how that the biſhops of the eaſt churches (to whom <hi>Iulius</hi>
had written ſomewhat ſharpely, in the behalfe of <hi>Athanaſius</hi>
and others that fled to him) did make anſwere to <hi>Iulius,</hi> with a
letter ful of tauntes and threatnings, and ſhewed that their chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
were as great and as many as his: finding fault alſo with
<hi>Iulius</hi> for receiuing ſuch to his communion, and ſuch other
things. So that wee ſee that they did not account the Biſhop
of Rome as ſupreame head of the church: neither doth <hi>Sozo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
ſay that <hi>Iulius</hi> his ſeat came to that dignity by Chriſtes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
or by Gods law, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> tooke in hand to
proue, but hath not brought one teſtimony of the fathers that can
performe that promiſe.<note place="margin">The church of Rome pleadeth poſſeſsion, not by right.</note> They plead as the Lawyers ſay in <hi>poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſorio,</hi>

In thus many caſes popes haue intermedled in other biſhops

is how iuſtly, by what right, law or authority, they haue
done many of the things that they haue done. We would haue
them plead <hi>de petitorio.</hi> Let them proue their right. For it is
true that long ſince the pride of this ſeat did beginne, abuſing
Gods good liberality, and the fauour of godly princes towarde
them, ſtill increaſing in that ambitious humour, vntill they had
ſet themſelues aboue all. Which authority when they had once
gotten, they did ſhew themſelues vnſatiable and cruell, deſpiſing

matters of religion, doe thinke or ſay? Much ſuch proofe might
be had out of the legend of lies. But that will neuer proue their

            <p>Laſtly the woordes of <hi>Iuſtitian</hi> in that hee calleth the pope
<hi>Iohn</hi> the ſeconde,<note place="margin">Epiſt. ad Ioh. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice primo titulo.</note> head of all holy churches may well bee admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
as in former times that name head was often vſed, yea, and
is ſtill of vs. A man of good dexterity or countenance is called
a head man among others although hee hath not authority ouer
them. But ſuch a head as now the pope is become, that will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troll
all biſhops, yea depoſe emperours, diſpence with Gods

<hi>Iuſtinian</hi> himſelf could not haue liked. And it muſt be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
that we deny not, but a biſhop of Rome (as alſo another ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>)
may welbe called head of the church, if they be indewed with
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:7294:47"/>
ſuch gifts as are to the benefit of the whole church. But we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
both that the name is or ought to be peculiar to the church of
Rome,<note place="margin">How we deny the pope to be head of the church.</note> or the biſhop thereof only: and alſo that the authority
which by that and ſuch like names he challengeth vnto him is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
in him or in any other. For indeede our contention is,
whether the biſhoppe of Rome haue ſupremacy ouer the whole
church or not. Now excellent names were giuen vnto men in
times paſt,<note place="margin">Tom. 2 pag. 162. Pag. 263</note> as the name of pope, <hi>Baronius</hi> a great papiſt of our
time, confeſſeth was common to all biſhops.<note place="margin">Ruſſin. Hiſt. lib. 2. cap. 28.</note> The like he alſo
writeth of the name of vniuerſall biſhop. And <hi>Athanaſius</hi> was
called <hi>Pontifex maximus. The greateſt biſhop,</hi> and yet not
he, but <hi>Liberius</hi> was then biſhop of Rome. And for this name
head (as I haue ſhewed) it is nothing ſtrange in all ſocieties,
to haue a heade man, and yet he not to haue iuriſdiction ouer
them. By all which it appeareth, howe weake an argument may
be drawen from theſe names which may be common to ſo many,
to proue the ſupremacy which the biſhop of Rome challengeth
to himſelfe onely.</p>
            <p>Nowe maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hauing wrung what he can (which
is not much) out of the fathers of the greeke church, commeth to
the latin writers, to try what gleanings he can get among them.
Whom I doubt not but we ſhall finde ſpeaking very reuerently
of the church of Rome,<note place="margin">Bellar. arg. out of latine writers.</note> as in truth it well deſerued, becauſe that
the biſhop of Rome (although he began very ſoone to encroche
ſomewhat vpon other mens right, and to enlarge his power) yet
he vſed his greatneſſe and authority for a long time, to the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of true religion the comfort of the diſtreſſed, and to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande
by himſelfe, and other the biſhops of the Weſt church, the
hereſies that troubled eſpecially the Eaſt churches. In al which
things we know that by their place, for that they were biſhops of
the Imperiall city, and the authority that they were come vnto,
by fauour of the Emperours, they were as it were ringleaders
vnto others: ſo that although they were moued ſometimes to
theſe good things, by a deſire that they had to be medling in all
matters, which was one of the waies whereby they came to their
greatnes: yet in that they did good vnto the church, the godly did
both commend them, and alſo beare with them, although ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
they were too forward, and ſtept too farre before others.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:7294:47"/>
But when they would haue had this authority confirmed to them
in councils, and eſtabliſhed as a law of the church, then did the
ancient fathers, wiſely withſtand their vnlawfull deſires, as the
vi. councils of <hi>Carthage,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Why and howe although the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine fathers did reuerence the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Rome.</note> and the councill of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> doe
plainly proue. So that the godly learned fathers of thoſe times,
partly to incourage them in their well doing, did giue them due
commendation when they deſerued it, and partly for quietneſſe
ſake and the peace of the church, did wincke at many of their
inordinate proceedings, and vnorderly attempts, ſo long as they
were but their priuate actions; yet would not the iuriſdiction of
the vniuerſall church. And theſe things being well remembred,
I may I truſt be ſhorter in anſwering to the particular places.
And firſt for the place out of <hi>Cyprian,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lib 2. cap. 16. Dè Vnit Eccl. alias ſimp. prelat.</note> which maiſter <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>
proſecuteth in many words as he is forced to doe, that he
may get out of him but a ſhew of an argument. It is anſwered
in few words. For indeede maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> groundeth vpon
a falſe principle, which I dare not ſay that he could not but ſee
his errour, but it is maruell if he can be ignorant of it.</p>
            <p>The wordes wherein he eſpecially truſteth are theſe.<note place="margin">Cyprian exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> This
commeth to paſſe (that hereſies growe in the church) whilſt there
is no returning to the beginning of the truth, neither is the head
ſought for, neither is the doctrine of our heauenly maiſter kept.
Nowe by this word head he vnderſtandeth the head of the church
whom he maketh <hi>Peter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereas it is moſt certaine that <hi>Cyprian</hi> doth meane nothing
els here, then in another place where he endeuoureth to perſwade
after the ſame maner and by that very argument, where by the
head he meaneth that which the apoſtles taught. For ſaith he
if we returne to the head and beginning of the tradition of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
mans errour ceaſeth. And there he teacheth vs by
a ſimilitude howe we ſhould come to the heade, by the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
I ſay of a conduct, wherein if the water faile we goe to the
head of it, that is, to the fountaine, and ſo from thence examine
the want of the water: ſo ſaith he, muſt Gods prieſtes goe to
the beginning when there is any queſtion of Religion. And that
he meaneth that head in this place, the very wordes by him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged
do prooue, becauſe the former wordes put vs in minde
of returning to the originall or beginning of the trueth, and the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:7294:48"/>
wordes that follow, leade vs to the heauenly doctrine. Well
then, the head in this place doth ſignifie the ſpring and fountain,
from which our doctrine muſt beginne, and ſo maſter <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi>
argument is quite ouerthrowen. And hauing proued that
he buildeth his reaſon vpon a falſe ground, I truſt I neede not
beſtow any more labour to proſecute him in his wandering
wordes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Optatus</hi> is the ſecond who ſpeaketh nothing to helpe this
deſperate cauſe.<note place="margin">Contrr Parme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. li. 2.</note> For although he commend vnto vs that one
chaire in reſpect of the vnitie of doctrine (for all the prieſts nowe
ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> muſt ſit,<note place="margin">Hom. 85. in Iob. 20.</note> not vpon <hi>Moſes</hi> chaire, but vpon
Chriſts chaire) yet in the wordes alleadged by maſter <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>
he addeth, and we haue proued that that is ours by <hi>Peter.
Optatus</hi> a biſhop in Affrike (not of Rome) ſitteth in <hi>Peters</hi>
chaire. Therefore <hi>Peters</hi> chaire and the popes chaire are not
all one, vnleſſe their doctrine be one. It is not tied to Rome, or
to that church. But alluding to that place of <hi>Moſes</hi> his chaire
which our Sauiour Chriſt ſpeaketh of, becauſe the Scribes and
Phariſes taught that which <hi>Moſes</hi> did teach.<note place="margin">Matth. 23. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Optatus</hi> alſo ſaith
that he doth ſit in <hi>Peters</hi> chaire, becauſe hee taught that which
<hi>Peter</hi> did confeſſe and teach.<note place="margin">Optatus againſt Peters chaire at Rome onely.</note> Yea, and he prooueth by this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
againſt the Donatiſts (who taught, that they onely
were the church) that the church is alſo where he taught, becauſe
euen there is <hi>Peters</hi> chaire: ſo that if <hi>Optatus</hi> your owne wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
ſpeake truly, then you haue maruellouſly abuſed the world
for many yeares, in making them beleeue that S. <hi>Peters</hi> chaire
is at Rome onely. But Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſeemeth ſomewhat
plainer then the reſt,<note place="margin">Amb. in epiſt. 1. Timoth. 3.</note> in that firſt place alleadged by maiſter
<hi>Bellarmine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The church is called Gods houſe, whereof <hi>Damaſus</hi> is a
ruler this day. But yet the words do not import any ſuch thing,
as may prooue the Supremacie of the Biſhop of Rome. For,
wee will not deny that the Biſhop of Rome is a ruler in the
church, but, that he is the only ruler we can not graunt. But
Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> expounding thoſe wordes of <hi>Paule</hi> wherein he
teacheth <hi>Timothie</hi> how to behaue himſelf in Gods houſe,<note place="margin">Ambroſe anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> takes
occaſion to ſhew, both what is Gods houſe, namely, the church,
and who they are that are rulers in Gods houſe, namely, the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:7294:48"/>
or paſtours to whom the miniſtery is committed. And to
make this plaine by an example, he ſetteth before vs the houſe of
God at Rome, which is the church there, and the ruler of Gods
houſe there, who is <hi>Damaſus</hi> their biſhop. If any man aſke
how it commeth to paſſe that he rather nameth <hi>Damaſus</hi> then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other biſhop? Sundry reaſons of it may be yeelded. Firſt
<hi>Ambroſe</hi> himſelfe was a biſhop in <hi>Italy</hi> (for <hi>Milaine</hi> is in <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>)
vnder the popes wings, and therefore the biſhop of Rome
was the moſt famous biſhop and better knowne to his people
then any of the other patriarches, and therefore fitteſt for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
            <p>Secondly there had beene a very great ſchiſme or ſtrife about
the popedome,<note place="margin">Platina in the life of Damaſus.</note> one <hi>Vrſicinus</hi> ſtanding for it againſt <hi>Damaſus,</hi>
ſo that many of both ſides were ſlaine in the very church in ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
for it. But <hi>Damaſus</hi> in the end obtaining the popedome
Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> to teſtifie his owne perſwation, and to aſſure o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that <hi>Damaſus</hi> and not <hi>Vrſicmus</hi> was biſhop of Rome,
although he ſtood for it, doth take occaſion heere to name him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Platina.</note> 
               <hi>Damaſus</hi> beeing pope was accuſed of whoredome
whereof hauing cleared himſelfe, it is not vnlikely but that S.
Ambroſe did the rather take this occaſion to pull al ſuſpition out
of other mens minds, by giuing this teſtimony of him. Another
cauſe alſo may be added, that as it ſeemeth he was as learned as
any biſhop of Rome before him. For which S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
a being a learned man, might then rather delight in naming
him.</p>
            <p>The reſt of the places out of S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> haue no waight
at all.<note place="margin">Orat. in Satyrum</note> 
               <hi>Satyrus</hi> did aſke the biſhop, whether he agreed with the
Catholicke biſhops, that is with the Church of Rome. He mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
by catholicke biſhops, ſuch as held the catholicke faith, that
then was maintained at Rome. If it be a good argument to ſay
Rome is a catholicke church, therefore it muſt gouerne all the
churches in the world: then will this alſo be a good argument,
<hi>Hippo</hi> was a catholicke church, ſo was <hi>Millaine,</hi> ſo are alſo the
churches that we haue allowed in <hi>England</hi> by authority, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they were, and ours are heads ouer all others. And that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> will not allow. But he aſketh why the biſhops
are not catholickes that agree not with the church of Rome, if it
<pb facs="tcp:7294:49"/>
be not becauſe Rome is the head of the catholike church? I
maruell much that maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> whoſe wordes go for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
with many, will ſhew himſelfe ſo ignorant of that he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadgeth.
For if hee had read but the wordes that immediatly
doe follow,<note place="margin">Bellarmines ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance or falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</note> the reaſon is, there rendered why he aſked that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
namely becauſe the church there was in a ſchiſme. For one
<hi>Lucifer</hi> had ſeperated himſelf from their communion. Lo here
M. <hi>Bellarm.</hi> he dreameth not of any headſhip of that church, but
aſketh this queſtion whether he helde the faith that then was
preached at Rome.<note place="margin">Athanaſius.</note> And <hi>Athanaſius</hi> in his creede ſpeaketh in
this ſence of a catholike faith. Yea the name of catholike was
alſo as it were a note of their profeſſion. That whereas the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſts</hi>
gloried, that they onely had the true church, the catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes
on the contrary would be known by their name, that in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
place of the world, they might be of the true church. Yea
there were Emperours that made a lawe,<note place="margin">The name of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike.</note> that whoſoeuer belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
the one godhead in trinity and equal maieſty of the father,
the ſonne, and the holy ghoſt ſhould be called <hi>Chriſtians, and
Catholikes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lib. 7. cap. 4.</note> as their law doth teſtifie. Yea <hi>Sozomen</hi> repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
of a lawe made by the Emperour that all ſhould beleeue the
lawe deliuered by <hi>Peter</hi> the head of the apoſtles (but howe he
may be called head of the apoſtles I haue ſhewed before) and
that nowe <hi>Damaſus</hi> biſhop of Rome, and <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi>
doe holde and that they onely that worſhip the trinitie with like
honoure, ſhould be called the catholike church. And doeth mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> to make his bad proofe ſeeme better, aſke howe
they may be called catholikes, that agree with the church of
Rome, vnleſſe it be in this reſpect, that they take it to be the
head of the catholike church? heere are catholikes we ſee and
yet not bound to beleeue that head.</p>
            <p>After he alleadgeth two other places of like force.<note place="margin">De Sacram, li. 3. cap. 1.</note> The
effect of them is, that he woulde followe the paterne of the
church of Rome. So woulde I alſo if I had liued in thoſe
daies, when they ſincerely held the faith committed to them by
Gods worde. And he doubtleſſe, if he ſawe the ſuperſtition, and
Idolatry, and treaſons, that vnder coulour of religion, are hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
there in our daies, he would thinke euen the cotten ruines
of Rome, to bee ouer good, to bee a cage for ſo badde birdes.

            <p>To go forward, out of ſaint <hi>Ierome</hi> hee reaſoneth thus:
Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> for pope <hi>Damaſus</hi> anſwered:<note place="margin">Epiſt, ad Alg. de Monogam.</note> the Synodicall
conſultations of the Eaſt and Weſt, therefore they that ſought
for anſwere from the ſeate of Rome in their matters acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
the ſuperioritie thereof. If I ſhould tell Maiſter <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi>
againe, that Maiſter <hi>Caluine</hi> in his time, and Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<hi>Beza</hi> in his time, haue anſwered more matters and queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that came from ſundry of the reformed Churches, and ſome
particular men, then many of the popes of that time, yet I am
ſure he wil neuer confeſſe them to be vniuerſall Biſhoppes, for
that. No more neede wee graunt to him, that the Pope is a
vniuerſall Biſhop,<note place="margin">Ad Damaſ. ep. de nomine hypoſtaſ.</note> becauſe many queſtions were mooued to
him. Againe, Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> confeſſeth himſelfe to be <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſus</hi>
his ſheepe, and that hee is of communion with him.
Alas, what childiſh proofes are theſe? May not <hi>Hierome</hi>
confeſſe himſelfe to depend vpon <hi>Damaſus,</hi> but that hee muſt
thereby tie all others likewiſe to be ſubiect vnto him? It is a
ſhame for men ſo to deceiue the world, aud to haſten euen their
owne damnation by abuſing the ſimple in ſuch ſort. They crie
it out in euery corner, that there is no ſaluation to be hoped for,
vnleſſe they doe acknowledge the Biſhoppe of Rome to bee
head of their Church: and yet are they not able to yeelde ſo
much as one good reaſon out of the Scriptures or ancient wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the purer age for proofe of their doctrine. It muſt bee
beleeued as an article of faith, and yet they coulde ſhewe no
ground, no warrant for it.</p>
            <p>Out of ſaint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> is alleadged, that in the Church
of Rome,<note place="margin">Epiſt. 162.</note> the principalitie of <hi>Peters</hi> chaire hath alwayes flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed.
<hi>Auguſtine</hi> and <hi>Optatus</hi> as they were in one time, ſo
were they of one minde. And as before out of <hi>Optatus</hi> I ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed,
and that by Chriſtes teſtimony, that the Apoſtles chaire
is his doctrine, ſo here doeth it ſignifie. And ſaint <hi>Auguſtine</hi>
his meaning is, that Rome hath eſpecially kept the Apoſtles
doctrine or faith, the which in Saint <hi>Auguſtines</hi> dayes,
might truely bee verified. Againe, out of Saint <hi>Auguſtine
epiſt.</hi> 92. he deſireth pope <hi>Innocent</hi> to helpe them againſt the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:7294:50"/>
Pelagians, which maruellouſly troubled. Paleſtine and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frike.</p>
            <p>Now out of this will he conclude the popes Supremacie.
But ſaint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> himſelfe denyeth that hee had any ſuch
meaning, in that he was one of that ſixt councill of Carthage
that ſo ſtiffely denied ſupremacie vnto the pope, ſeeking it ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly,
and by very falſe practiſes. And the Biſhop of Rome,
was then of great abilitie to doe good, as alſo any other may be,
and yet not haue iuriſdiction ouer them that ſeeke for that good
at his hands. I would haue them to bring ſome plaine proofe,
and not ſo to ſtand vpon ſtrange coniectures.<note place="margin">Epiſt. 157.</note> Againe, <hi>Sozi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
biſhop of Rome willed hini to go to a councill at Ceſarea,
and hee therefore ſaide that hee muſt needes goe. If <hi>Sozimus</hi>
did commaund, and <hi>Auguſtine</hi> would not ſtand vpon his right
in ſuch a matter, where perchance his going might be profitable
to Gods church, yet that would not make <hi>Sozimus</hi> head of the
church. No, at that time they did not gather any ſuch hard con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions.
For although they would not refuſe to do good, euen
being more imperiouſly commaunded then reaſon would, yet
ſupremacie (as I haue ſhewed) they would not acknowledge
in the Biſhop of Rome, but rather were content to bee at great
charges to conuince the popes falſhoode.</p>
            <p>In the laſt two places ſaint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> commendeth the
biſhop of Rome,<note place="margin">Ad Boniſ, l. 1. c. 1.</note> in that being ſo high as he was, yet he would
be friendly to them that were humble or lowe, and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth
euery Biſhoppe to be high, yet him to be higher. A man
may be friend to them that are lower then he is: and one Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
may be higher than others, and yet not haue iuriſdiction
ouer them.<note place="margin">Proſper de ingr.</note> Higher, I ſay in gifts, credite, place or many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
waies.</p>
            <p>In England we ſee differences of biſhoprickes,<note place="margin">Proſper exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> where yet
the one hath not iuriſdiction ouer the other. Now for <hi>Proſper,</hi>
it were hard if his poeticall amplifications ſhould be able to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
away the weight of ſo great a cauſe. But for his words if he
ſay that Rome is <hi>Peters</hi> ſeat in reſpect of the doctrine that there
was taught and maintained, as before <hi>Optatus</hi> and <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi>
(of whome he was a great follower) haue done, wee
yeelde vnto him. Otherwiſe I leaue the godly Reader to the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:7294:50"/>
arguments before alleadged, to conſider what he ſhould think
concerning this point, whether <hi>Peter</hi> was Biſhop there or not.
And where he ſaith that Rome is made vnto the world the head
of paſtorall honour, wee yeelde vnto that alſo, that at that time
there was no church, that either more ſincerely did keepe that
which the apoſtles taught, or had more credit and authoritie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
other churches then Rome had, in reſpect that ſhe was
able and willing to do good vnto many other.</p>
            <p>But where he ſaith that what by armes ſhee could not, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
ſhee hath ſubdued: is not ſimply true. For there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
that neuer were nor will be (by likely hood) ſubdued to Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh
religion. But in ſome reſpect we alſo confeſſe that to be ſo,
in that religion ſubdueth the heart, and winneth the affection of
men to bee ſubiect, whereas that outward force can onely
preuaile againſt the outward man.<note place="margin">De perſecution<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Wandalica.</note> Now for <hi>Victor Vticen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi>
who calleth the church of Rome head of all other churches,
I haue often ſhewed that it may truly ſo be called in reſpect of
the authoritie which by many occaſions it had goten, not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of any inriſdiction that Chriſt gaue vnto it, more then to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
The next is <hi>Vyncentius Lirinenſis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vincent. Lyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenſ. in commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit.</note> who alluding vnto
the name, or indeede rather giuing vnto Rome that name, that
was commonly giuen vnto it, ſaith that the head of the world
gaue teſtimonie vnto it (meaning the council of Epheſus.) You
ſee ſaith maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> that the biſhop of Rome is called
head of the world.<note place="margin">Vincent wrung to a wrong ſenſe.</note> Nay you ſee howe our popes catholiks in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croch
more and more, for that vnſatiable gulfe of the church, of
Rome, which will neuer haue honour and authoritie enough.
Who euer before maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath called the pope the
head of the world? He hath wont to be but head of the church.
But I feare that if his kingdome continue a while <hi>Acharonta
mouebit,</hi> hee will keepe a ſtir in hell alſo. But <hi>Vincenſius</hi> giu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
no ſuch name to <hi>Iulius</hi> biſhop of Rome. He would not be ſo
iniurious to the ciuil authoritie he had learned better then ſo, to
giue to <hi>Caeſar</hi> that that belongeth to <hi>Caeſer,</hi> and to God that
that is Gods, although the church of Rome might quite blotte
out of their bookes that leſſon, for any regarde that they haue
to keepe it.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Vincentius,</hi> his meaning is plaine enough to them
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:7294:51"/>
that will ſee the trueth. For hauing ſpoken of ſundry places
from whence learned men came to that councill of <hi>Epheſus,</hi>
firſt out of the Eaſt, then alſo out of the Weſt churches, he
nameth <hi>Iulius</hi> biſhop of the citty of Rome, which citty he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
the head of the worlde, as immediately after he calleth
<hi>Carthage</hi> one of the South, and <hi>Millaine</hi> one of the North, the
ſides of the world.</p>
            <p>But if he had made ſo very great accompt of the church of
Rome, as in theſe daies men would haue vs to doe, he would
haue had perchance ſome more regard in placing that church in
ſome other order, then to make it almoſt the laſt that he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth.</p>
            <p>Out of <hi>Caſsiodor</hi> a ſenatour and a great officer in Rome
maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> alleadgeth ſomewhat.<note place="margin">Lib. 11. Epiſt. 2. ad Ioh. papam.</note> You (ſaieth he to
<hi>Iohn</hi> Biſhop of Rome) ſit as watchmen ouer chriſtian people,
as you are called father you loue all.</p>
            <p>I ſee nothing heere that can helpe maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> or
his cauſe. For who euer did thinke otherwiſe, then that the
Biſhoppe of Rome, was a watchman ouer chriſtian peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple?
Or who will ſay that the Pope hath not or at the leaſt
ſhoulde haue a fatherly affection towardes all?<note place="margin">If he commende his cure, how proueth that his power?</note> Well it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.
It is our part to looke to ſomewhat, you looke
to all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſsiodor</hi> liuing vnder the popes noſe, is content either
by this praiſing of him to teach him what care he indeede ſhould
haue, not onely to doe good to the people of Rome where he
was Biſhop, but alſo as occaſions ſhould be offered to helpe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
alſo. Or els it may be that hee giueth him greater praiſe
then he deſerueth.</p>
            <p>But what is this for the popes ſupremacy? Muſt not the
building needes fall that ſtandeth vpon ſuch weake propes?
Much like is that which followeth that the ſeat which is pope
<hi>Iohns</hi> peculiar place, is giuen generally to the whole worlde,
that is as I take it to doe good to all. If a <hi>Romane</hi> magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
to the biſhop of Rome doe extoll more then in truth he
may, the power of that citty, or els tell how farre their benefits
doe extende, muſt this be ſo ſtrained and wrung to prooue ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie?</p>

The laſt teſtimony alleadged by maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth<note place="margin">Valentinianus Theodoſ. in prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amb. Concil. Chalcedonenſ.</note>
ſo little helpe his cauſe, that if he had done wiſely he ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

<hi>Leo</hi> Biſhop of Rome did then beſtirre him vſing the diſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Eaſt church as a meane to increaſe his owne autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.
For it is moſt plaine and cannot be denied, that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
in that councill,<note place="margin">Leo earneſtly ſeeketh ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy.</note> by his legates, he ſought the ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy

that the councill did againſt it. And in theſe Epiſtles he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth

               </gap> in this Epiſtle here cited by maiſter <hi>Bellarmine, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinian</hi>
ſheweth howe <hi>Leo</hi> came vnto him, told him of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion
of the Eaſt church, and great troubles there. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
<hi>Flauianus</hi> a catholike biſhop was depoſed by <hi>Dioſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
and ſo cruelly handled, that he died thereof within three
daies.</p>
            <p>Well <hi>Valentinian</hi> maketh petition to <hi>Theodoſius, That</hi>
(the biſhop of Rome) <hi>may haue place and power, to iudge
of the faith and of the prieſts.</hi> Which requeſt made by <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinian,</hi>
in the letter which <hi>Valentinian</hi> confeſſeth that <hi>Leo</hi>
requeſted him to write, ſo iumping with that which afterwards
<hi>Leo</hi> in the councill practiſed, may much perſwade vs to thinke,
that he ſolicited <hi>Valentinian</hi> the Emperour, either plainly or
couertly, to moue this in his behalfe. Well then this being but a
requeſt made that it may ſo be, that cannot proue that it was ſo,
but contrary.</p>
            <p>And what reaſon doth <hi>Valentinian</hi> the Emperour an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
friend to the biſhop of Rome, vſe to commend his ſuite. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity
gaue him principality of prieſthood ouer all. Wherein I
firſt note that not Chriſt, but ancient cuſtome, is pretended to
haue priuiledged him.</p>
            <p>And here againe marke howe this agreeth with that which
was afterwards in the council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> obiected by <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſnus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Supremacy clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by cuſtome not by gods law.</note>

Rome (ſaith <hi>Paſchaſinus</hi>) alwaies had the ſupremacy.<note place="margin">Act. 16.</note> But this
his allegation was proued falſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:7294:52"/>
But the allegations of <hi>Valentinian</hi> the popes ſolicitour in
this cauſe, and of <hi>Poſchaſimus</hi> the popes legate being ſo like,
it maketh me the bolder to coniecture, that they were both for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in one ſhop, becauſe they haue both one ſtampe.</p>
            <p>Thus haue I taken a view of all ſuch teſtimonies as are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged
by maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> out of them, that liued within
600. yeares of Chriſt, for to eſtabliſh the pride of that Romiſh
ſeat. I haue of purpoſe omitted iii. or iiii. by him alleadged,
becauſe they wrote after the time that <hi>Phocas</hi> that murthering
traitor, (who killed <hi>Mauritius</hi> his Lorde and maiſter for his
Empire, hauing firſt killed before his face his wife and fiue of
his children,) had granted vnto <hi>Boniface</hi> biſhop of Rome third
of that name, to be ſupreme head ouer the whole church. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
although I haue endeuoured to be ſhort, yet I truſt it plainly
enough appeareth to them that will not ſhut their eies againſt
the truth, that although the church of Rome had indeede in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of her conſtancy in the truth, and power which ſhee grewe
vnto by many occaſions, being in the imperiall citty, great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
amongſt all other churches: and although learned men
were by their diſtreſſed eſtates forced many times in their priuat
ſeates, to yeelde to that church more intereſt to meddle in their
matters, then of right it had: yet it cannot appeare by any thing
that they bring out of any approued record, within the compaſſe
of thoſe yeares, that the church of Rome was either by Gods
lawe, appointed the head ouer others, which is indeede the point
that they ſhould proue, or that by common conſent of the godly
it was ſo catholickly receiued. And yet if this latter could haue
more apparent proofe, then euer Rome or Rhemes can afforde
in this cauſe, they ſhould gaine nothing, but that good men haue
either ordained or tolerated ſuch a ſtate. Which howſoeuer it
might ſeeme tolerable, when many good men poſſeſſed that
place: yet that the church, ſhould be ſubiect to ſuch as nowe for
the moſt part ſit in that ſeat, no chriſtian heart can well endure
it. But now this labour being taken in hand, to trie the popes
title vnto the ſupremacy, or how he pleadeth, or what claime he
can make: I muſt needes giue warning to the chriſtian reader,
to marke how that as maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath ſaid little, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
nothing at all, to prooue this authority of the biſhop of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:7294:52"/>
to be grounded vpon Gods lawe: ſo be hath not brought one
council within the ſaid ſix hundred yeres or any thing ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
materiall out of the fathers of that time to proue that by mans
lawe he was decreed ſo to be, but onely ſomtimes perchance by
particular men vſed, as if he had authoritie ouer all. And ſhall
this be accounted a catholike doctrine, that neither God nor
man, for ſix hundred yeares after Chriſt, commaunded to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued?
If there come no better euidence then maſter <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>
can bring, without all doubt the pope will be found, to be
but an intruder into other mens right, a vſurper of other mens
iuriſdiction.</p>
            <p>But maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> will helpe his former want, with
a new ſupply.<note place="margin">Li. 1. cap. 17. Obiect. of Bellar.</note> He affirmeth very boldly, as hee doth often in
other matters, that we knowe neither the time wherein, neither
the author by whom, this ſupremacie had beginning. Yet it
may be that we ſhall geſſe ſhrewdly at it.<note place="margin">Anſwere.</note> But firſt wee muſt
vnderſtand that the roote of this ſupremacie that is the pride
and ambition of heart that was in many of the popes, was ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
long in the ground before it did ſprowt and plainly ſhew it
ſelfe, and when it grew that it might be ſeene, yet was it not
perfected in a long time after. But it did plainly ſhew it ſelfe
in the time of <hi>Phocas</hi> of whome I ſpake before. For he with
much adoe ordained,<note place="margin">Plat. in Bonif. 3.</note> that the biſhop of Rome ſhould be called
and counted the head of all churches, as many of the popes
frends tell vs, and among other <hi>Platina.</hi> A very fitt patron,
for ſo proude a prelat. And after that the pope had gotten by the
emperours decree, this glorious title, yet he could not preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
get quiet poſſeſſion of the ſame, but the biſhop of <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi>
did ſtill ſtriue for that name.<note place="margin">Omph. annot. in Bonif. 3.</note> Vntil at the length, they
were both content to winke, and the one to ſuffer the other to be
be called vniuerſall biſhop. So that both of them had that name,
and were ſo called. And nowe the biſhop of Rome hauing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taiued
thus much in the weſt church, that hee in all councils and
meetings was chiefe, and that they ſhould ſubmit themſelues
to him. Before it was long hee had taken ſo good roote aud be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gane
to grow ſo mighty, that he durſt alter and chaunge, giue to
and take from men at his pleaſure, and to turne all things vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
downe, yea and in the end, to cheeke the greateſt monarchs.
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:7294:53"/>
But of theſe matters I ſhall if God will haue better occaſion
to intreate in the ſecond parte of this treatiſe. Now I will only
ſay that they were comme to ſuch power as <hi>Platina</hi> writeth of
<hi>Boniface</hi> the eight,<note place="margin">Plat. in Bonif.</note> that they would rather put feare into the
hearts of emperours, kings, princes, nations, and people then
religion. And thus when they had bene in increaſing and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in ſtrength, for the ſpace of at the leaſt eight hundred yeares,
at length in the council of Florence we find this their ſoueraigne
and ſupreme power confirmed in theſe words.<note place="margin">Concil. Florent.</note> We define that
the holy apoſtolike ſeat, and biſpp of Rome hath the ſuprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
in the whole world. So that although we cannot perfectly
ſay, when this poyſon of pride beganne in the church of Rome,
yet you ſee we can perfectly enough tel when it beganne to ſhew
it ſelfe, and when it was made an eccleſiaſticall drecrees.
Neither is that of any waight which maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> alleag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
out of <hi>Gregorie</hi> to the contrarie,<note place="margin">Lib. 7. epiſt. 63.</note> that the church of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi>
is vnder the church of Rome. For he cannot meane
thereby the church of Rome ſhould haue ſupreame authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
ouer it and all other churches, ſeeing that no man more then
<hi>Gregorie</hi> inueieth againſt the name of vniuerſall biſhop, but
his meaning is onely this, that the church of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi>
is not of ſo good account or authoritie in meetings or aſſemblies
as that of Rome. Which beeing applied to our queſtion
proueth nothing. For to prooue that the church of Rome may
ſit, or go, or write his name, before the biſhop of <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
is not to prooue him to haue iuriſdiction ouer him. That
which out of <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> he alleageth,<note place="margin">Pag. 98.</note> is anſwered before, as that
alſo that hee bringeth out of the epiſtle of <hi>Valentinian</hi> to
<hi>Theodoſius,</hi> ſauing that maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> incrocheth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what,

ſaith that Antiquitie hath giuen that to Rome,
maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſeeth that will not ſerue his turne, to
prooue it to haue beene from Chriſt, from whom onely they

almoſt all ſtories, when they denied <hi>Phocas</hi> firſt to haue giuen

maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith that <hi>Phocas</hi> did but declare this thing,
and that it was before. Yea what needed this any declaration of
of the emperour, if the church had receiued it as a catholike doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine.
Or if it be not a catholike doctrine, what meaneth
maſter <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> to make ſo falſe braggs as he ſometimes
doth, of the conſent of fathers in this doctrine. And thus I
truſt I haue layed open the vanitie of the proofe, and the weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the argument, whereby they indeuoure to ſtrengthen
and eſtabliſh, the tyranous ſoueraigntie of the church of Rome.
For if <hi>Peter</hi> had no ſuch iuriſdiction ouer others, hee could not
giue it to any other. If his beeing biſhop of Rome, haue not
any ſuch ground, but that it may iuſtly be doubted of, and ſtrong
preſumptions to the contrarie: then is not the popes ſucceſſion
of <hi>Peter,</hi> ſo certaine, as they would haue it thought. Yea and
if <hi>Peter</hi> were biſhop of Rome and if hee had ſuch ſoueraigntie:
howe do they proue that it is bequeathed to them, to what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
howe in what words, at what time, in what place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for
what witneſſes? Al which things how weakely they prooue,
hitherto I haue declared. And yet to goe further, admitte,
that <hi>Peter</hi> had ſuch iuriſdiction, which cannot bee prooued,
but I admit I ſay that hee had it, admit alſo that hee could,
and did, leaue the ſame to the biſhop of Rome, which we alſo
iuſtly denie: muſt it therefore cleaue ſo faſt to that chaire in
Rome,<note place="margin">If iuriſdiction were had, yet it might be loſt.</note> that it can not for any cauſe bee altered? Muſt it be ſo
hereditarie to his ſucceſſours, if they had beene his ſucceſſours
that are biſhops of Rome, that they could not forfet it for any
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:7294:54"/>
terſpaſſe, that it may not be taken from them, for any offence?
God forbid that wee ſhould be ſo fooliſh, as to tie God to anie
place or people, to any ſect or ſucceſſion in ſuch ſort, as that
howſoeuer men doe abuſe his graces, or their owne callings,
yet ſtill they muſt haue the place that once they haue gotten,
and they muſt ſerue him in that place, whether he will or not, as
though they had it by euerlaſting patent.<note place="margin">Exod. 28. 1.</note> Did not God chuſe

that the church of Rome is the true church, becauſe they haue

themſelues (now where is the vnitie that ſo much they bragge
of?)</p>
            <p>And becauſe there haue beene many wicked popes, amongſt

doe beſt become ſuch ſwines ſnowts. But what maketh

the rather to be induced to imagin, that it is a true church,
becauſe euen the heades thereof, haue beene ſo bad compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
and ſo abounding in all wickedneſſe?</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7294:56"/>
Forſooth becauſe if the biſhop of Rome had not beene of Gods
appointment (ſaith he) and that church the true church, it coulde
not haue ſtood and continued ſo long, being ſo full fraught with
ſo many ſinnes. But that is it that is in queſtion whether the
church of Rome be the true church or not. We deny it, wee
finde not in it the ancient faith, the doctrine of the apoſtles, the
ſincere word. Wee ſee not there, the pure adminiſtration of
Gods holy Sacraments. They teach vs outward hypocriſie for
true holines, fooliſh toyes, for ſpirituall worſhipping.</p>
            <p>Theſe and ſuch like things doe ſtrongly perſwade vs, that
God hath done to Rome as he hath done to Silo and to Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem
long ſince, and will he prooue it to be the true church becauſe
the biſhops are euill? Now if the name and outward ſhew of a
church, haue ſo blinded the eies of maiſter <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that hee
will, that it muſt needs be as it is called, that is to ſay, the catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke
church,<note place="margin">The name of the church is often where the church is not.</note> I would haue him looke to Ieruſalem, how in the
time of Chriſt, when the church was in them that followed
Chriſt, yet the name and outward glory of the church, remained
with the prieſts, and that company, which were the greateſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to Chriſt and his church.</p>
            <p>As therefore we ſee not in the church of Rome when we try
their doctrines, any probability that they are the true church of
Chriſt: ſo we ſet this downe as the infallible courſe of his iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
with whom it is counted a righteous thing, to ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
againſt ſuch as delight in ſinne, that he that ſpared not the

candleſticke, fight againſt them with the ſword of his mouth, and
ſpew them out, when they reiect his truth.</p>
            <p>Thus then we ſee that God left the prieſts, whom he had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
the people, whom he had brought out of Aegypt, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to be his peculiar inheritance, the place, that hee had choſen,
the temple, that hee commaunded to be made, becauſe of their
ſinnes.</p>
            <p>Let theſe things make vs with indifferent iudgement, and
without partialitie to trie, whether God be alſo departed from
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:7294:57"/>
that church of Rome or not. For there is no doubt, but if any
people whatſoeuer, ſinnes as they did, they may alſo be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
as they were: But that church of Rome hath ſinned, in as
abundant meaſure, as euer did Ieruſalem, as themſelues and
their owne ſtories doe ſhew, therefore why ſhould they flatter
themſelues imagining that God will not deale with her, as he
hath dealt with others.</p>
            <p>And here wee may conſider howe vntrue that popiſh po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
is, that the church of Rome, or the Biſhoppe of Rome
can not erre. Can hee ſinne? They confeſſe that hee can not.
Yea, and their owne ſinnes doe record ſuch ſinnes of theirs,
as aſcend vp before the Lord, and cry vnto God for vengeance.
No doubt then but ſuch may erre, and fall into hereſies alſo.
For it is truely ſaid of Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> that men by their
ſinnes doe fall into hereſies, and hereſies are the very puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for ſinne. For he that is the iuſt iudge, muſt needes
poure foorth his wrath,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 18.</note> vpon ſuch as detaine the truth in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe,
and vpon ſuch as knowe God by his workes,
but will not glorifie,<note place="margin">Verſe 21. 23.</note> him as God, and therefore in their exceſſe
of folly doe turne the glorie of the incorruptible God, into the
ſimilitude of corruptible man, yea and of things moſt baſe and
vile, for man to worſhip.</p>
            <p>Thus then wee ſee howe ſinne deſerueth, that God in his
wrath ſhoulde ſtrike with blindneſſe, ſuch as do delight therein.
For when the loue of the trueth is not receiued, God ſendeth
vnto ſuch as refuſe the trueth, ſtrong illuſions, that they ſhould

In ſomuch as <hi>Nehemiah,</hi>

Therfore alſo he preuaileth againſt Gods people by that wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked

(whoſe ſinnes are greater then were the ſinnes of Sodome and

Or that the pope cannot erre, whoſe wicked doings are as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiue
as his power is great? Maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his booke
of the biſhop of Rome, taketh great paine to prooue that the
pope cannot erre. But euery bodie may ſee by his doubtfull
ſetting it downe, that he cannot well tell what to affirme of it.
For he will not conſent with ſuch Romiſh catholicks as teach
that the pope may erre, and alſo teach hereſie, if hee define any
thing out of a councill.<note place="margin">De pontif. Ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but reiecteth his opinion, who although that the pope cannot be
an hereticke, or teach hereſie openly though he alone define of
any thing.</p>
            <p>But maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> will walke in a middle path which
is this: that whether, the Pope may bee an hereticke or not, he
cannot ſet down any hereſie, to be beleeued of the whole church,
wherein this conditionall manner of ſpeaking, (if or whether he
be an hereticke or not) doeth ſhewe his doubtfulneſſe in this
queſtion. But becauſe he is perchance in the next chapters e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
in the fift chapter of a more reſolute opinion, I vrge
not this point any further. But this is his flat reſolution,<note place="margin">Li. 4. de Rom. pontif. cap. 3</note> that

(for I ſet downe his words) that hee can not onely not erre, as

it be, it is but a dead faith) and godly conuerſation, is as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
for euery Chriſtian, as true religion. I maruell that
maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> or any other ſhame not to tell vs, that the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
of Rome cannot erre from the right path of knowledge,
(as if they were wholy lead by Gods ſpirite) whereas manie
of them haue wholy wandred out of the waies of godly life, as
men nothing guided, but quite forſaken of that holy Ghoſt.
And therefore this I ſuppoſe may ſerue for my firſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Such as are not lead by Gods ſpirite to liue godly are not
taught by the ſame: but many of the Biſhops of Rome are not
lead by Gods ſpirite to liue godly, therefore many of them are
not taught by the ſame, and by conſequent they may erre. For
they haue no colour of not erring, but that only that they claime,
the direction of that ſpirite, that was neuer promiſed to ſuch
prophane prelates, nor cannot lodge in ſuch ſinkes of ſinne. My
ſecond argument is this.</p>
            <p>Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> the ſixt did teach,<note place="margin">Arg 2. to proue the pope may erre.</note> that the pope may be an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retike,
and teach hereſie. And this doctrine was defendet by him
and others,<note place="margin">De pontif. Rom. li 4. cap. 2.</note> as maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe confeſſeth, ſo that
he would haue it to bee beleeued of all. And no man can denie,
but that it is a queſtion of faith, eſpeciallie in the Church of
Rome, whether the pope maie erre or not. Thus then I rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
<hi>Adrian</hi> the ſixt Pope of that name, did either ſay that
which was falſe, or that which was true. If he ſaid falſe, then
he beeing a pope was deceiued in iudgement, in a matter of
faith, and ſuch a matter as he woulde ſhoulde bee receiued vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſally,
as a catholicke doctrine, and ſo the pope hath erred.
If hee ſaie true, then is it alſo euicted by his teſtimonie, that
the pope may erre. For he affirmeth it ſo. So that whether hee
lie or ſpeake the trueth, it is ſufficient to prooue that which I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour
to proue. For if hee lie himſelfe erreth, if he ſay true o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
may erre.</p>
            <p>The thirde argument ſhall bee of the examples of ſuch as
did erre:<note place="margin">Arg. 3. To prooue that the pope may erre.</note> I ſay of ſuch biſhops of Rome, as haue beene by their
owne ſtories,<note place="margin">Marcellinus. Damaſus in pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificali.</note> noted for heretickes. I will not ſpeake any thing
of pope <hi>Marcellinus,</hi> who ſacrificed to Idols, as alſo ſtories doe
teſtifie, bicauſe it is ſaid that he repented him therof. But yet we
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:7294:59"/>
may learne out of him, that if a pope may fall to ſuch frailety
as to commit ſo groſſe Idolatry, which is a greater ſinne then
to fall into many of the hereſies, that are condemned (by that
name) of the fathers, he may alſo erre in iudgement.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Liberius</hi> a pope,<note place="margin">Liberius. Hieron, in cron.</note> did not only conſent to the condemnation
of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> that great learned and catholike father, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ancient hiſtories doe report, and our aduerſaries deny not, but
alſo did communicate with two notable <hi>Atrian</hi> heretikes, which
was a great offence to the godly, and an incouraging of thoſe
heretikes. But maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> anſwereth that neither he
taught any hereſy,<note place="margin">Lib. 4. de Pontif. Rom. cap. 9.</note> or was an heretike. The queſtion is, whether
the pope may er or not. Now our aduerſaries draw vs from the
queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">The papiſts an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere not direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the queſtion whether the pope may erre.</note> not anſwering whether <hi>Liberius</hi> did erre or not, but they
tell vs that he was no heretike, and that he taught no hereſie.
And admit he did neither of theſe two, I meane that he neither
became an heretike, neither yet taught hereſie: yet he may erre.
Yea <hi>Liberius</hi> did fouly erre, in that externall action, whereby our
aduerſaries confeſſe that he conſented to the baniſhment of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanaſius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bellar. de Rom. Pontif, li. 4. ca. 9.</note>
and in communicating with thoſe two <hi>Arrians Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
Viſacius,</hi> and by help of <hi>Arrians</hi> get again to be biſhop of
Rome, depoſing <hi>Felix.</hi> For to er is to wander or go out of the
right way, whether it be for ignorance or feare, or through any
other affection, he that ſteppeth aſide doth erre. And becauſe this
giueth great light, to al that is to be ſaid of this queſtion: it ſhal
not be amiſſe ſomewhat more throughly to conſider of the ſame.
Firſt you ſee that whereas their doctrine is briefly deliuered that
the pope cannot erre: they wil haue it thus to be vnderſtooed, the
pope cannot be an heretike, that is, he cannot continue obſtinatly
in hereſie, nor he cannot teach hereſie, when he giueth generall
precepts that ſhould belong to the whole church. For that is
the meaning both of <hi>Melchior Canus,</hi> in his Theological pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,<note place="margin">Lib. 6. cap. 8.</note>
and of maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in this place before alleadged.
The intent alſo of their doctrine, is to commend vnto vs that
their <hi>Italian</hi> head, as a fit head, for to guide the vniuerſal church,
and able to be ahead to the whole body.</p>
            <p>Nowe therefore let vs ſee how well their doctrine, and their
meaning agree together. For the head of the church ſhould be
ſuch, as ſhould in nothing, no not for a time leade the body of the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:7294:59"/>
church awry. But the church may be led into many fooliſh opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
ſtrange conceites,<note place="margin">The difference betweene errour and hereſie. De ciuit. dei Li. 18. cap. 51.</note> and dangerous doctrines euen by ſuch
as cannot be called heretikes. For an heretike is he (as Saint
<hi>Auguſtine</hi> telleth vs) that being of any euill and corrupt opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
in the church, and being reproued, or moniſhed to amend,
reſiſteth ſtubbornly, and will not reforme his contagious and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous
doctrines, but defendeth the ſame, and is drawen to deuiſe
or follow ſuch opinions, for his own profit, eſpecially for his own
glory, and to aduance himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Now who ſeeth not, that a man in place of credite and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,
as the biſhop of Rome hath beene (by ſuch bad means
as he hath vſed theſe many yeares, may wonderfully indamage
and indanger the church of God, before any body wil or dare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue
him, for any opinions that he will holde? And when he
is found fault withall (as he muſt be before they can count him
an heretike) how many ſubtile ſhifts can euil men haue, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
a long time in their wicked opinions, without reuoking
the ſame, or reforming themſelues, and yet to auoide the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of being accounted ſtubborne or obſtinate. The Pelagians
againſt whom ſaint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> writeth many bookes did turne
many waies their lewd opinions,<note place="margin">Contra 2 Epiſt. Pelag. l. 4. 5. 6.</note> changed often (in ſome ſhewe
of words) their poſitions, and did adde (as by reaſon they were
forced, and by arguments compelled) ſome ſuch wordes vnto
their errours, as that thereby they might auoide the note of
contumacy, and deceiue the more vnder a ſhew of truth, as may
appeare by ſaint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> who confeſſeth plainly, that if their
meaning were not knowen to be euill, their wordes could well
enough haue beene borne withall. Admit then that a biſhop of
Rome, being of ſuch abſolute authority as now they are, could
as cunningly as did the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> couer and cloake an hereſie.
Might not he be an heretike many yeares, before he would be
driuen to recant? And might not he then by ſuch meanes, bring
irreparable hurt to the church of God?</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee, that as by this doctrine that the pope cannot
erre, they goe about to aſſure vs, that the head which they haue
ſet ouer the church, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not deceiue vs, if we wil be lead by him: ſo
their interpretation of that their poſition, argueth in them great
doubtfulnes, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they dare not defend their own fayings, vnleſſe
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:7294:60"/>
they may expound their words after this manner, that the pope
cannot erre, that is he cannot obſtinately or ſtubbornly teach (as
a doctrine to be receiued of the whole church) any hereſie. And
I pray you what ſafety can the godly finde in following ſuch a
head,<note place="margin">A ſimilitude.</note> as when he hath guided them into many errours, yet he
will not ſtubbornly ſtand in defence of them? Such may wel be
compared to ſouldiers, that by the raſh leading of an vnſkilfull
captaine are brought into the hands of their enemies, and when
the captaine ſeeth his folly, he would faine mend it if he coulde,
and is ſory for that he hath done.</p>
            <p>But what helpeth this his late repentance, the diſtreſſed ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers?
nothing at all. Euen ſo that the biſhop of Rome cannot
continue in his errour (if it were true that he had ſome ſuch pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge)
it might be good for himſelfe: But ſuch a head is for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
very dangerous, becauſe y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> not all they who are ſeduced by
ſuch mens inſtruction or example, are alſo reduced by their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation
or amendment, as appeareth by multitudes of exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.
And ſo we ſee that this their interpretation ſtandeth not
with either their common receiued doctrine, or with their intent
and meaning which is to promiſe ſafety from errour, vnto them
that receiue that head. Whereas in truth their meaning is to
tell vs that the pope may be of a wrong iudgement, but if he be
much vrged he cannot be obſtinate, he wil not ſtand to it. And
whereas they defend,<note place="margin">Bellar. de Rom. Pontif. li. 4. c. 3.</note> that the pope cannot teach hereſie as a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
publikely to be receiued, in ſome reſpect I thinke it to be
moſt true.<note place="margin">Popes no tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers.</note> For ſeldome or neuer are there any popes, that can
teach either truth or hereſie. They cannot preach, they cannot
with wholeſome doctrine feede their flocke, they cannot deuide
the foode of life, and breake the bread of the word, vnto Gods
houſhold ſeruants. For want of knowledge, they cannot of
themſelues doe much either in defence of truth, or to maintaine
errour. But this expoſition will not pleaſe them. They haue
another meaning. For when they tell vs, that the pope cannot
be an heretike, when he teacheth the whole church, their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
is plaine enough, that in particular iudgements they may
erre, but not in their generall decrees, or preachings or inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Which they are forced to ſay, for the auoiding of ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences,
as might growe by defending the doing of many
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:7294:60"/>
of their popes. But if popes may be charged with hereſie, how
can we thinke but that in their talke,<note place="margin">Popes doings or ſayings may be hurtful to many.</note> in their ſermons (if they
did preach,) and vpon all ſuch occaſions as were offered vnto
them, they would by foure means or other, commend that which
they liked of, and condemne the contrary? And their very words
when they ſpeake of matters of faith, are indeede inſtructions to
all: and their examples alſo, are publike inſtructions to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> whole
church. Neither muſt we imagine that thoſe (holy fathers for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth)
had one religion in ſecret, and an other that they would
publiſh. Therefore if we proue that they did erre, I truſt alſo it
will followe, that this errour was a ſtumbling blocke to the
church, and that they may erre when they giue leſſons to all the
church.</p>
            <p>Laſtly let vs conſider the foundation whereupon they raiſe
this building.<note place="margin">Luke 22. 31. 32.</note> Becauſe Chriſt ſaid vnto <hi>Peter, Simon Simon.</hi>
behold Sathan hath deſired to ſift you as wheat. But I haue
praied for thee that thy faith ſhould not faile. To whom was

of <hi>Theophilact</hi> I haue ſhewed. But <hi>Peter</hi> immediatly after
erred,<note place="margin">Peter after this prayer erred. Matth. 26, 74.</note> ſo as that he thriſe denied his maiſter, as Saint <hi>Luke</hi> in
the ſame chapter ſheweth, yea and that as Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth,

appeareth, that Chriſt did not pray that <hi>Peter</hi> or the reſt of the

were put of the nature of man, but that finally he or they, ſhould
not fall from the faith. But I cannot but maruell here at mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that he cannot ſee that <hi>Peters</hi> faith at this time
failed.<note place="margin">De Rom. pontif. li. 4. cap. 3.</note> For euen handling theſe words, and this fact of <hi>Peters,</hi>
we know not ſaith he, that <hi>Peters</hi> faith euer failed. He feared

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:7294:61"/>
we thinke the pope to be more holy, of a more ſanctified nature,
of a ſounder iudgement, then <hi>Peter</hi> was? They will not

            <p>And further I muſt put the godly reader in reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance, that

their owne frends, without any note of hereſie affirme, that
popes may erre. Yea what is there in them but errour? They
wander out of the wayes of truth and of godlineſſe. So that
in that accurſed companie, we may ſee that to be moſt true, that
where there is a boundance of ſinne, there God iuſtly may, and
often times in his iudgements doth, caſt ſuch into the deepth of
errour, that they who had no deſire to liue according to the light,
that did ſhine vnto them, in ſeruing the Lord in true holineſſe,
ſhould be caſt into the dungeon of ignorance, as vnworthie to
inioy that light which they ſo vnthankefully refuſed, of that
grace which they ſo wickedly abuſed. The matter then being
thus, that neither <hi>Peter</hi> had any ſuch iuriſdiction ouer the
whole church, as is claimed by the church of Rome: neither
if he had it, he could, or (for any euidence that yet is ſhewed)
he did bequeathe it to the Romiſh church, and laſtly ſeeing
that church if any ſuch priuiledge, had beene lawfully to her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolued,
hath committed ſuch things, as would haue forfeted
a better right, then euer ſhee had in that vniuerſall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie:
it doth (I truſt) appeare to the indifferent Reader,
that their claime is vniuſt, their title falſe, and that they haue
no colour of intereſt from Chriſt, whoſe ouely poſſeſſion that
is, that they would haue. But it is no new thing in the church

and ſought, that they might get the true copies of that Nicen

did agree which came from thence, they muſt be moſt true, as
they all acknowledge writing to pope <hi>Boniface.</hi> When the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies

and all they of they council miſtooke the matter,<note place="margin">De Rom. Pontif. Lib. 2 cap. 25.</note> being deceaued
by ignorance, becauſe they knew not what the council of Sardis
did ſet downe concerning that point. The queſtion is whether
the council of Nice did giue ſuperiority ouer all other to the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of Rome, as his legates did affirme? And it is moſt plaine
that it did not. And therefore that which is in the councill of
Sardis, (which if we ſhall beleeue the booke of councils, ſet

in that pointe, as not to take order for the better keeping
of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Auguſtine</hi> writeth of that council of Sardis that is was an
<hi>Arrian</hi> council,<note place="margin">Contra Creſco, lib. 3. cap. 34.</note> holden againſt <hi>Athanaſius.</hi> The time alſo when
it was kept is very vncertaine. Yea almoſt al the circumſtances
argue great doubtfulnes of that council. They that write the
ſtory of that council, doe write thereof ſo diuerſly, both for the
number of biſhops aſſembled there, and alſo concerning the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi>
being there, which ſome affirme, ſome deny, that therby we
may learn how little credit is to be giuen to it, for to ground any
vncertain or doubtful doctrine vpon, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> it might haue credit. But
that which maiſter <hi>Bel.</hi> doth afterwards ſay, is yet more abſurd.
For hauing affirmed that he is indeed perſwaded, that theſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
(which the church of Rome alleadgeth for her ſupremacy.)
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:7294:64"/>
are not in the Nicen couecil, but onely in that of Sardis, yet he
thinketh that <hi>Zozimus</hi> and <hi>Boniface</hi> two biſhops of Rome, did
therefore name them the decrees of the Nicen council, becauſe
they were both written together in a booke at Rome,<note place="margin">Whether that booke at Rome may by likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode be truer than the bookes of the Greeke church.</note> the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce
whereof did much trouble the fathers as he ſaith. Can
maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſuppoſe that thoſe fathers, whoſe earneſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour
was at that time to keepe the decrees of the councill of
Nicen, were ignorant what was to be accounted of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
or what articles belonged to the ſame? Or is it likely that
the copies of the councill of Nice ſhoulde bee more perfect at
Rome ſo many hundreds of miles diſtant from Nice, then at
<hi>Conſtantinople</hi> which is hard by it, or at <hi>Antioch</hi> or <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria</hi>
not ſo far diſtant from it? Or doth he thinke it reaſon,
that one Romiſh and another vnknowen copie, writen perchance
with that councill of Nice, by ſome that ſought thereby to
increaſe the dignitie of the church of Rome, of ſet purpoſe to
bring it to that credit, that it ſhould be accounted as parcel of
the council of Nice: can he I ſay thinke it reaſon that thoſe two
copies ſhould correct and control, ſo many of better credit by a
great deale, then they are. No, theſe are but ſhifts to blind
mens eies, and indeede but bables for fooles to play withall.
Maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth alſo labour in this place very earneſtly

that the church of Rome hath alwaies had the ſupremacie, in
which falſe tricke <hi>Paſchaſinus</hi> Legate vnto the Biſhop of

was by thoſe copies diſprooued. And whereas maiſter
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth ſet downe this as the intent of the Biſhop of
Rome in the Councill of Carthage,<note place="margin">Li. 2. cap. 25.</note> that he meant to ſhew, that
not onely all men might appeale to him, but alſo that it were
expedient for the church, that ſo they ſhould do. Marke how di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
the councill of Carthage doeth oppoſe it ſelfe againſt the
Pope therein, in their epiſtle which hath this title, <hi>The Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
of the Affrican Council to pope Celeſtine biſhop of the
citie of Rome.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Conc. Afric. cap. 5</note> For, whereas maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> did confeſſe
that the cauſes of inferiour miniſters might be heard at home,
but Biſhops muſt be heard at Rome: this councill in this epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
ſaith directly contrary,<note place="margin">No appeales to the pope.</note> vſing it as an argument from the
leſſe to the greater: If (ſay they) the cauſes of inferior clarks
by the councill of Nice are prouided for, how much more is it
ordered then, that biſhops if they be excommunicate in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince,
ſhall not of your Holineſſe be haſtily, or raſhly, or againſt
order thought to be reſtored to the communion? Thy will him
to baniſh from him, ſuch as ſeeke ſuch wicked refuges, becauſe
(ſay they) the Nicene decrees haue plainely committed, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
clarkes onely, but alſo the Biſhops to their metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litanes.
They aſſure themſelues, that no prouince ſhall want
the grace of Gods ſpirit, to order theſe things. And that euerie
man may, if he miſlike of the iudgement of them that haue heard
his cauſe, appeale to a councill either prouinciall, or generall
(no wordes of appealing to the pope.) Unleſſe a man will ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
(ſay they) that God will grant his ſpirite of triall of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to euery one, and deny it to all aſſembled in a Councill.
And further, they alleadge that the trueth of matters examined
farre from home, can hardly be found out, by reaſon that wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
can not well be carried ſo farre. For, as for the legates
<hi>à latere</hi> that ſhould come from the popes ſide, for examination
of ſuch matters, they vtterly miſlike, as a thing not to be found
in any of the ſynods of the fathers.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee, that in as plaine termes as they can deuiſe, this
Councill doeth oppoſe themſelues to that which the Biſhop of
Rome did ſeeke to obtaine. And thus it appeareth, how vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truely
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:7294:65"/>
the church of Rome hath delt very long ſince, to exalt her
ſelfe aboue others, and to maintaine her owne pride. And how
ſhee hath in the times of thoſe learned fathers, beene bridled in
their councils. Wherein they haue ſet downe lawes, to miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
and keepe vnder their immoderate affections, how ſoeuer
they would ſometimes write or ſpeake of them, or to them that
were biſhops of Rome for the peace of the church, and the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of the perſons being men often times indued with very
good gifts, and ſuch as by their acquaintance and credit, being
in the imperiall citie, did helpe many that were diſtreſſed.</p>
            <p>Now therefore let vs yeld that honour to him onely whome
God hath ſealed,<note place="margin">Iohn 6. 27. eph. 1 22. matth. 17. 5. 1. pet. 2. 25.</note> that he be acknowledged the head of his church,
the lawe maker to his people, the ſheapheard to his flocke. Let
vs receaue no other vicar to ſnpply his roome,<note place="margin">Ioh. 14. 16, 17.</note> but that ſpirit of
truth which God our gracious father ſhall giue, and which ſhall
abide with vs for euer. But as for them, that without any good
warrant of Gods word, or ſufficient calling from God, claime
to be as kings, and loue to liue as lords ouer Gods heritage,
deteſt them as the proud off-ſpring of <hi>Corah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biram,</hi>

wordes how they haue ruled. And becauſe the church of Rome

rule and dominion, ouer al that profeſſe chriſtianitie: it wil
not be amiſſe, but a thing very pertinent to this my purpoſe, to
ſee by what ſteps the pope hath come to ſuch height, &amp; by what
practiſes, he hath attained to ſuch honour. Whereas therefore
the godly fathers of the primitiue church, did many times ſtand
in neede of the help or counſel,<note place="margin">Helping the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed churches in their neede.</note> or comfort, of the good Biſhops
of Rome, that were in their times, and as occaſions fell out,
were forced ſomtimes to flee to them for ſuccor, who alſo found
reliefe at their hands very often: the ages ſucceeding, did inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
this charitable affection, and performance of chriſtian duety
in theſe godly Biſhops of Rome, to be not ſo much tokens of
the loue towards all, as of their power ouer all. And yet a man
may be as good as he will to them, ouer whom he hath no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
at al. Although therefore we neither can nor will deny, that
which the Author of the Apologie for the Engliſh Seminaries
doth ſo confidently pronounce, that the famous fathers called
for aide, comfort, and counſell in their diſtreſſes of the biſhop of
Rome: yet iuſtly we may, and for the true<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hs ſake, we muſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme,
that this ſeeking for theſe cauſes to the biſhop of Rome
doth not prooue him to haue authoritie ouer all, but onely that
at ſuch times, he had better meanes to helpe the diſtreſſed then
they that ſought vnto him, had to releeue themſelues. But ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times the godly are forced to flie for aide (as theſe men did
whom the Apology nameth) as <hi>Cypr. Atha. Chryſ. Aug. Baſil,

deſire more particularly to be informed, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpecial cauſes that
moued theſe godly men, to make ſute to the B. of Rome, let him
reade that learned anſwer, that <hi>Bilſon</hi> hath made vnto the ſaid
apologie, &amp; he is too wilfull, if he be not ſatiſfied for this point.
Now ſome B. of Rome, though otherwiſe good men, were pufe
vp with ſome prowd conceit of their authoritie, when they ſaw
ſuch famous and godly men, were driuen to ſeeke for their help,
as it may appeare by their owne words, if they be their words,
which go abroad in their name, for their Epiſtles and decrees.
As <hi>Damaſus</hi> in his fourth epiſtle, writing vnto proſper the B.

maruell though <hi>Damaſus</hi> woulde write or ſpeake much for the

to the death of a great number of chriſtians.<note place="margin">Decret. Innocen. Tom. 1. Concil.</note>

haue them. And <hi>Innocentius</hi> writing to the biſhops of macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
findeth himſelfe grieued, and thinketh that that church of
Rome, to which he telleth them they ſhoulde haue regard, as to
their head, is wronged becauſe they did not at the firſt, yeelde to
his iudgement. The like might be ſaid of many other of them.
Whereby appeareth, that they who at the firſt were intreated by
ſome godly men, by ſuch means as God had giuen them to help
them in their need, at the length tooke vpon them to commaund
others, to ſtand to their orders and decrees. Inſomuch as they
alſo gaue out their decrees, which they would binde al to obſerue
as partly appeareth in <hi>Siricius</hi> and <hi>Innocentius,</hi> and partly alſo
in others, it will be more plaine.<note place="margin">Epiſt. ad Hefich, Tom. Concil. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:7294:67"/>
And thus we ſee two ſteppes laide, to help them vp to this their
deſired honour. The one is a voluntary ſubmitting to them for
aide,<note place="margin">The two firſt ſteps to the popes ſupremacy.</note> councill, and comfort. The ſecond, a forcible ſubiecting of
others to them, by decrees, and commandements. But yet they
could not get so high by far as they did looke, or at the leaſt ſo
farre as now they haue climed. For as in more then 300. yeares
whileſt they were in perſecution, they had no ſuch proud hearts
for any thing that we can read in any credible authors:) ſo for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
300. yeares more, they did but feede themſelues in their
own honour, and got what credit and authority they coulde by
their own deuiſes and pollicies. Howbeit they could not get any
vniuerſal or general conſent of other biſhops, to giue them that
authoritie.</p>
            <p>But contrary wiſe not onely ſome councils as that which is
called <hi>Mileuitanum</hi> and that ſixt of <hi>Carthage,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Conncils againſt ſupremacy.</note> and that other of
<hi>Chalcedon,</hi> did ſtiffely withſtand him therein, but alſo the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
or patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> who in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> council of <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon,</hi>
was made of equal authority with the biſhop of Rome,
did earneſtly ſtriue to get the ſupremacy,<note place="margin">Conſtantinople ſtroue for it.</note> ouer Rome and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
And by al likelihood he had preuailed, if <hi>Mauritius</hi> the
the Emperour, (who as ſome ſtories report tooke part with the
patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi>) had not beene cut of cruelly, by
<hi>Phocas</hi> that did ſucceede him in the empire. So that hereby the
pride of the biſhops of Rome was ſomewhat hindered, and this
authority which nowe he claimeth was almoſt taken from him.
And he that ſoone after, did write himſelfe vniuerſall biſhop, or
rather biſhop of the vniuerſal church, and head of the church,
had almoſt beene ſubiect to the patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
So that in good time did the popes thinke, that that vnnaturall
and ſauage bloud ſheader <hi>Phocas,</hi> did cut his maiſters throate:

               </note> they got that ſupremacy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
on their ſide, that the biſhops of Rome ſhould be called and

of this cruel Emperour,<note place="margin">The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> ſtep vnto the popes ſupremacy.</note> is the third ſtep vnto their intollerable
pride. The biſhop of Rome hauing thus gotten, ſome ſure foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in this proud chaire, controlleth biſhops, calleth councils
which before the Emperour had wont to doe, and in all othe
ſuch things, doth ſhewe his authority, in his writings and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:7294:67"/>
for the moſt part calling himſelfe the head of the vniuerſal
church, ſtil creeping thus higher and higher, yet not openly but
couertly and by little and little: vntill at the length he got him a
fourth ſtep.<note place="margin">The fourth ſtep. He depriueth the Emperour of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing any thing to doe in the popes election.</note> For hauing as much authority as he could yet ouer
biſhops, and that by the Emperours decree, he ſought to pull
his necke out of the coller, wherein the Emperour did hold him.
For he thought it was a burden to bee in ſuch ſubiection to the
Emperour, that vnleſſe he would confirme the election, he could
not be pope.</p>
            <p>Therefore whereas <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the fourth Emperour of
that name, being moued (as the ſtories report) by the godlineſſe
of <hi>Benedict</hi> the ſecond, biſhop of Rome ſo called, did ordaine
that he that was choſen pope, by the cleargy, people and army of
Romans, without any confirmation of the emperour or his lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant,
ſhould be accompted pope: whereas before it might not
be without the emperours leaue, who had, as alſo the kings of
<hi>France</hi> eſpecially, a chuſing voice in the electing of the pope, if
we wil beleeue a ſtory written by a Frier,<note place="margin">Ioh Rioche compend. Hiſt,</note> a faſt friend to the
church of Rome, called <hi>Rioche</hi> who wrote in our times: after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Emperours would haue reſumed their own right a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
perchance becauſe that after <hi>Benedict</hi> they found none
ſuch, but ſome ſucceſſours of his, that behaued themſelues too
arrogantly and inſolently, againſt their Lorde and maiſter, but
they coulde by no meanes get it into their handes to keepe it,
though <hi>Leo</hi> the viii. and ſome other yeelded vnto him. For the
ſucceeding popes many of them did ſtil incroche more and more,
debarring the Emperour of his right in their election, vntill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
400. yeares after that the biſhops of Rome had gotten
this from the Emperour, <hi>Alexander</hi> the 2. pope not willing to
ſtriue againſt his maiſter,<note place="margin">Benno a Card. of the life and acts of Hildebrand.</note> did publikely proteſt in the pulpit,
that he would not be pope vnleſſe the Emperour woulde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
him, whereof he ſaid he would write vnto the Emperour.
When <hi>Hildebrand</hi> who was after pope and called <hi>Gregory</hi>
the ſeuenth heard this, hardly being able to hold his hands, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt
maſſe was in doing immediatly maſſe being ended, before
the pope could put of his maſſing garments, he taketh him into
a ſecret place, and buffeteth him well fauouredly, and tooke ſuch
order, that within a while <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſecond died, and made
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:7294:68"/>
roome for <hi>Hildebrand</hi> to ſit in his chaire. And this reward did
pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſeuenth, beſtow vpon his predeceſſour <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
the ſecond, becauſe he would reſtore to the emperour, that
which wrongfully they kept from him, and performe vnto him
ſome piece of duty. And yet they thought they were not high e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
neither yet that this their authority was ſure enough vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them. And therefore they thought good to deuiſe ſome means
how this authority which already they had might be confirmed
to them, minding yet to mount higher, as God willing ſhall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
be declared.</p>
            <p>But to make ſure that they had done,<note place="margin">The profe of the ſupremacy out of gods wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſeeme to haue this authority from Chriſt. But their proofe is
nothing plaine, &amp; although they alleadge ſome words of Chriſt
for proofe, yet, the apoſtles did neuer make any mention of anie
ſupremacy, the fathers of the firſt times, did neuer commende it
vnto vs, in the councils they ſeeme rather to fetch their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
from the ordinance of man, then from Gods word. For
what meaneth it els, that the legates to the B. of Rome, both in
the councill of <hi>Carthage</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> doe ſo earneſtly vrge
the decrees of the Nicen councill, if that which now they bring
out of Gods booke, had beene knowen to be ſufficient proofe of
the ſupremacy? What needed they ſo notoriouſly to falſifie the
council? What needed the fathers to take ſuch paines, and to be
at ſuch coſt, as to ſend for true copies of that council, to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,
Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Antioche,</hi> to trie whether the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

of the kingdome of heauen, Chriſt had promiſed, or in theſe, feed
my ſheepe. Chriſt had giuen, ſuch fulnes of power ouer all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
to the biſhop of Rome? Seeing therefore that proofe ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
not ſtrong enough in thoſe times, the graunt which they
had from <hi>Phocas,</hi> did them no great good, to ſhewe what right
they had to that ſupremacy, (although thereby they got poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thereof:) For if by his gift they claimed, then they confeſſed
this their authority to be from man,<note place="margin">Phocas his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree they thought a reaſon ſcarce homeſt enough.</note> and that from too wickes

church of Rome or not. To make their title therefore as good
as they could, they deuiſed another helpe.</p>
            <p>They fained this gift to be from <hi>Conſtantine,</hi>

that publickly allowed of chriſtian profeſſion. And they
make him to giue, not onely his palace of <hi>Lateran,</hi> and many

would haue it thought, but they bring him in ſpeaking
theſe words,<note place="margin">Ce pontif. Rom. Lib. 4. cap. 17. &amp; lib. 5. cap. 9.</note>

and Ieruſalem, as alſo ouer, all churches in the whole earth.
And that the pope for the time being, of that holy church of
Rome, ſhall be hier, and Prince of all princes in the world.</hi>
Is this onely to giue temporalties? But the falſhood of the
donation of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> doth ſhine more bright then the noone
day, although the papiſts make great account of the ſame. Yea
<hi>Melchior Canus</hi> altogether a papiſt, yet he did either ſee more,
or dealt plaiulier, in this matter then did maſter <hi>Bellarmine.</hi>
For although he be loth to denie it, or to diminiſh the credit of it,
yet he bringeth moe reaſons againſt it, then hee with all his
felowes can be able to anſwere. So that we neede not ſeeke for
arguments out of <hi>Laurentius Valla,</hi> or others to confute it.
For euen hee hath giuen it a more deadly wound, then can be
healed againe. He confeſſeth that the lawyers take it to be but
a fained matter, and therfore cal it chaffe, for it is indeed ſo called
in their owne diſtinctions. He acknowledgeth that <hi>Euſebius,
Ruffinus, Theodoret, Socrates, Sozomenus, Eutropius,
Victor,</hi> and other authors of credit, who moſt diligently wrote
all that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> did, haue not onely made no mention of
that donation, but alſo doe affirme that he ſo deuided his empire
among his three ſonnes, as that the one of them had Italie.
And that <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus</hi> in his fifteenth booke
writeth, that <hi>Conſtantius (Conſtantines</hi> ſonne) had the rule
of the citie (of Rome) and made <hi>Leontius</hi> his liuetenant
there. And laſtly, that all Hiſtories record, that many Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
after that time ruled in Italie, yea and in Rome. What
can be more plaine? Their owne Lawyeares confeſſe it to be

but long before him, it hath beene ſpied by <hi>Anthonius</hi> B. of
Florence in his hiſtory,<note place="margin">Pant. 1. Tit. 8. c. 1. L. 3. of catholike concord.</note> by <hi>Volateran</hi> writing of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> &amp;
by the cardinal <hi>Nicolas Cuſam</hi> a faſt friend and faithful to that
Romiſh church, that this donation was not in the old coppies of
Grecians decrees. And therfore when it was added, themſelues
accompted it but chaffe and no good corne. And theſe and ſuch
reaſons made <hi>Pius</hi> the ſecond pope of that name, to maruell in a
certaine dialogue, written by him being a Cardinall, that the
Lawyers were ſo mad, as to make any queſtion of that matter,
which neuer was.</p>
            <p>And that wee may ſee,<note place="margin">Themſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree not to what pope it was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</note> how all things in this donation of
<hi>Conſtantine</hi> are but fained, whereas the donation maketh
<hi>Silueſter</hi> the Pope to whome this gift was giuen, yet in
another place,<note place="margin">Cauſ. 12. q. 1. ca. faturam.</note> the ſame thing is ſaid to be giuen vnto <hi>Melchia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi>
that was biſhop before <hi>Silueſter.</hi> And he is made to ſpeake,
as though it had beene done before his time alſo. And yet this
<hi>Melchiades</hi> was pope, about two or three yeares, before <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi>
was Emperour,<note place="margin">Cron. Euſeb.</note> and died long before he gaue peace
and quietnes to Chriſtians, as in the Cronicle of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> who
lined in thoſe daies, it may appeare. What needeth this point
of their doctrine any aduerſary. Themſelues doe fully confute
one another, And the prouerb is in this found true, when theeues
fal out, true men come by their goods. For theſe decrees if they
be well conſidered, it is not hard to ſpie falſhood in them both.
And therefore we may take heede how we truſt them, ſeeing that
in theſe two we ſee plainly, how the one is contrarie to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and both contrary to the truth. There are alſo ſome impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilities
in the ſaid donation, which doe ſufficiently prooue it, to
be but a fraudulent deede.<note place="margin">Impoſsibilities in the donation.</note> For the occaſion of this gift is there
ſet downe. Namely that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> beeing baptiſed is healed
of his leproſie, and thereupon giueth theſe things to <hi>Silueſter,</hi>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:7294:69"/>
of whome he was baptiſed. And yet beſids many other ancient
hiſtories of good credit, Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> doth plainly write, that
he was baptiſed at the latter end of his life, and that not of <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſter</hi>
biſhop of Rome, for hee was dead and alſo <hi>Marke</hi> that
ſucceded him, but of <hi>Euſebius</hi> biſhop of Nicomedia, ſome ſix or
ſeauen yeares after <hi>Silueſter</hi> was dead. How then could theſe
things be giuen to <hi>Silueſter</hi> at the baptiſme of <hi>Conſtantine,
Silueſter</hi> being dead ſo long before? Or howe at his baptiſme
in Rome, when he was baptiſed in Nicomedia, the chiefe citie
of Bithinia, many hundred miles diſtant from Rome? But it
is ſtrange that they are ſo impudent, as to name <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
at this time for one of the principall ſeats of biſhops, as in
this donation they do, which was called not by that name before
<hi>Conſtantine</hi> in the tenth yeare of his raigne did build it, but
while <hi>Silueſter</hi> and <hi>Marke</hi> his ſucceſſor liued it was called Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance.</p>
            <p>And about twentie or thirty yeares after the death of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine,</hi>
was there a councill at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Conci. Conſtant. 1. cap. 2.</note> wherein
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſea of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> obtained to be next in account to Rome
which before y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> time was no patriarchal church. And it is plaine
by ſtories that at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> ther was either no church at
all, or elſe very ſecret, vntill about the latter end of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi>
time. For that very yeare that he was baptiſed many of
<hi>Conſtantinople</hi> were baptiſed in ſomuch as <hi>Nicephorus</hi> mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
mention of aboue twelue thouſand men beſides women and
children,<note place="margin">Niceph. li. 7. c. 34.</note> that were baptiſed there at once. And <hi>Conſtantine</hi>
himſelfe doth much reioyce,<note place="margin">Theod. li. 1. ca. 16</note> in a letter that he writeth to <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius,</hi>
that in that citie which himſelfe did build, and did beare
his name, a very great mumber were become chriſtians, and for
that cauſe hee taketh care, that they might haue churches built
for them. So that as yet wee ſee they had not their churches
much leſſe can wee imagine, that then they had any Biſhops,
that would looke for ſo high a place among others. And
therefore euen hereby appeareth the falſhood and folly of this
forged donation.</p>
            <p>There are alſo in the ſame donation ſome things that ſauor
of the pride that afterwardes appeareth in the biſhop of Rome,
but was not then in them. For that donation falſely attributed
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:7294:70"/>
to <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> doth giue vnto the biſhop of Rome, greater
principality of power, then this kingly or roial maieſty had, and
an Imperiall authority.</p>
            <p>Nowe howe manifeſtly falſe this is, wee may very eaſily
marke, if we doe conſider either the ſtile, that the Biſhoppes of
Rome that then were, did vſe, when they wrote vnto their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren,
or their maner of behauionr, when they came amongſt
them, or the authoritie which the Nicen council, that was in the
time of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> gaue vnto them, but equall with the patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arches
of <hi>Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Antioch,</hi> and euery one of them to
looke to their owne charge (among whome if there were any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equalitie,
the priuiledges of the biſhop of Rome, had not ſo
large a compaſſe by far, as the other patriarches) or the ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty
which <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the emperour did ſtill keepe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercciſe,
in, and ouer, not Rome onely, but the whole church,
not in ciuil matters onely, but in calling of councils, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the biſhops, comforting the godly, reprouing the hereticks,
and in directing how and after what maner, they would debate
and determine matters in the council. To be ſhort, if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
how ſome of the councils, of which I haue often ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
alreadie, did ſtifly denie to the biſhop of Rome, for leſſe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perioritie
then by this graunt they might challenge, it will eaſily
appeare, that they knewe not then of any ſuch priuiledges, that
<hi>Conſtantine</hi> had graunted vnto that ſeat. For if then any ſuch
ſuperioritie or ſupremacie had beene due vnto them, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theres
of thoſe times, who often ſtoode in neede of their helpe,
would neuer ſo flatly haue withſtoode their indeuours. And
themſelues alſo would haue beene as readie by themſelues or
their legats, to haue pleaded the donation of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> if
then it had beene thought vpon, as they were to coine new
canons of the Nicen council. They pride therefore that in this
grant appeareth, doth proclaime to the world, that it ſauoureth
not of that chriſtian modeſtie, that was for the moſt part in the
biſhops of thoſe times, but it is ſome baſtard of a later breede.
And of that ſpirit of ambition, doth that alſo ſauour, that is ſaid
that the pope ſhould be prince of al prieſts, and aboue al churches
in the world. But this is confuted in that which before hath vin
ſpoken. For long after this the biſhop of Rome, yea and that by
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:7294:70"/>
vnlawful meanes ſometime, did ſeeke for that preheminence, but
it would not be graunted vnto them: how beit one thing in this
donation I cannot but remember you of, becauſe it ſheweth in
my iudgement, that this forgery was committed but of late
yeares in compariſon, euen after that they had brought the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
vnder their ſubiection, and did beare all the ſway in the
citie of Rome. And that is this, that they bring in the emperour
yelding the imperiall citie into the popes hands, and that as
though it were not fitt or ſeemely, that the earthly emperour
ſhould dwell there, where the heauenly emperour (ſaith he) hath
placed the head of chriſtian religion. Can there be any greater
diſgrace to worldly princes, then to make them vnworthie to be
neighbours to that proud prieſt of Rome? Can they lift vp
themſelues by any meanes hier in pride againſt man, then ſo to
aduaunce and eſteeme of themſelues, aboue the greateſt monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
in the world? Did <hi>Conſtantine</hi> vſe to ſpeake or write ſo?
Did he thinke himſelfe vnworthie to be neere them? They that
are but indifferently acquainted with the ſtories of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi>
doe know that he loued ful wel, to be not only neere to biſhops,
but euen among them alſo. But they that forged this fable,
would haue the world to thinke, that either they are more holy,
then euer were the leuiticall prieſts: or elſe that that good em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
his ſcepter, ſworde, and crowne, were more vnholy and
prophane, then thoſe enſignes of gouernment that belonged to
the kings ouer the Iewes. And what elſe doe all thoſe imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
ornaments, crownes, ſcepters, miter, coller, clocke, cote,
banners, and ſuch like ſignifie, which there they ſay are giuen
to them, but that this forgerie was committed, after that the
proud popes did ſo ouercrow the emperours, that they became
but as it were their ſeruants? For it was far from <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi>
minde to make him ſelfe their ſeruant as afterwards the
emperours were. And the popes that then were had other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to doe, and other thoughts poſſeſſed their hearts, then that
they could be caried away, to ſuch vaine deuiſes. They were
ſcarſly out of one perſecution, being freed from it by <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>
but that they fell into another that troubled the church
maruelouſly, namely the <hi>Arrian</hi> hereſie, againſt which the good
biſhops, did then oppoſe themſelues with might and maine.
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:7294:71"/>
And as theſe things doe ſauour of the pride of latter times, ſo
ſome things alſo ſauour of ſuperſtition, more then as yet was
crept into the church. For <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> in this his donation
which they impudently aſcribe vnto him, doth giue for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of lights in the church of ſaint <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> his poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions
in the eaſt, weſt, north and ſouth, and by name he recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
vp many countries, where he had giuen his poſſeſſions, for
the maintenaunce of thoſe lights. But in deed it appeareth that
he did beſtow his reuenues vpon more neceſſary things as in the
building of churches, whereunto chriſtians might reſorte to
ſerue God, and in calling the Nicen council, for the determining
of ſome queſtions in religion. As for lights if then they vſed any
yet ſuch large deuotion in ſuch toies and trifles is a plaine fruit
of latter daies of ignorance.</p>
            <p>Thus there is almoſt no kinde of thing granted vnto them<note place="margin">The imitation of the emperours court for officers</note>
in that dotation, but is a good argument to conuince their fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoode.
The apiſh imitation of the emperours court, for offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
and attendants, that is there graunted, doth alſo ſhew that
it was not deuiſed in the daies of the humble popes: &amp; the proud
cardinalles, who are theſe their ſtately officers were not yet
found.</p>
            <p>Many other exceptions might be made to that pretended do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
and many moe reaſons might haue beene brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it, but this that is ſaid, had beene more then enough, in
ſo plaine a matter, had it not beene that many of the popiſh
writers, haue pleaſed themſelues ſo well in their forged fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.</p>
            <p>Hetherto we haue ſeene howe the popes haue made of the
voluntarie ſuites that the godly made to the biſhops of Rome,
beeing forced thereto by ſome extremities, neceſſarie ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection,
and out of their requeſts, they gather a profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of obedience. Then alſo how they gote the decree of <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas</hi>
one their ſide. And laſtly, howe they got the right of
confirming the biſhops of Rome, out of the emperours hands,
pretending for theſe and all other their fulneſſe of power, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the words of our Sauiour Chriſt. But to ſupply the
want of helpe which there they find (for in trueth they make not
for that exceſſiue pride of the Biſhop of Rome) they pretend
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:7294:71"/>
(although without any colour of truth) a gift of theſe and other
their priuiledges, from <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great.</p>
            <p>But nowe let vs looke further into their practiſes. Did
they now content themſelues, when they had the commaund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of all biſhops, and had gotten this name, that is vnfitte for
any man to be called, Head of the vniuerſall Churches? Could
they content themſelues with this exceſſiue honour? No. They
muſt yet goe one ſteppe higher. For hitherto the Biſhoppes of
Rome were ſubiect to the Emperours, as may very well bee
prooued by their owne epiſtles. <hi>Gregory,</hi> who did ſo bitterly
inueigh againſt the proude name of vniuerſall biſhop, that <hi>Iohn</hi>
patriarch of Conſtantinople tooke vpon him, him ſelfe being a
biſhop of Rome, giueth many euident teſtimonies of this ſubie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
which the popes did acknowledge to the emperors.<note place="margin">Lib, 2. epiſt. 100,</note> As
moſt notably in an Epiſtle to <hi>Mauritius</hi> the emperour, hee
calleth the emperour his lord very often, yea he abaſeth himſelfe
as vnworthie to ſpeake to his lord, he being but duſt and a very
worme. He acknowledgeth himſelfe ſubiect to the emperours
commanndement, that he oweth him duetie and obedience, his
vnworthie ſuppliant and ſeruant. I omit many other that were
afore him.</p>
            <p>And out of an infinite number of teſtimonies that hee doth
afforde, I haue taken but one, and yet that ſuch a one as
doeth ſufficiently prooue what reckoning the biſhops of Rome,
at that time made of the emperours. And yet now we ſee ſome
pride beganne to ſhew it ſelfe in the church. For euen now was
that a great ſtrife for the name of vniuerſall Biſhop. And that
yet euen then did this learned father and Biſhoppe of Rome
acknowledge himſelfe to bee an vnderling to the Emperours,
yea, and after that <hi>Phocas</hi> had giuen the Biſhop of Rome
that priuiledge to bee head of the Church, almoſt a hundreth
yeeres,<note place="margin">Tom. concil. 2. concil. 6. Act. 4.</note>

ſome from the Councill to them, as they had commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
yea, and themſelues to bee vnto the Emperours ſeely
or ſimple ſeruants. But in the end this ſeemed a grieuous yoke
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:7294:72"/>
and a heavy burden.<note place="margin">The ſift ſtep to ſupremacy, the debaſing of princes.</note> They ſaid within themſelues we will not

hard attempt, it muſt needes be long in working. As in deede it
was, many hundred yeares.</p>
            <p>The firſt that I remember, that did diſgrace in any reſpect
the Emperour,<note place="margin">Platina in conſt.</note> was pope <hi>Conſtantine</hi> who was not aſhamed
to ſuffer <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> the Emperour to kiſſe his feete, which after
grewe to be the greateſt office of curteſie that the pope woulde
ſhew to the greateſt monarchs, to admit them to that baſe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment,
which alſo continueth to this day.<note place="margin">In Conſtantin.</note> Of him writeth
<hi>Onuphrius</hi> in his annotations vpon <hi>Platina. Conſtantine</hi> firſt
of any biſhop of Rome, durſt withſtand <hi>Philippicus</hi> the greeke
Emperour to his face openly.</p>
            <p>Perchance becauſe <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> that was Emperour next before
<hi>Philippicus,</hi> had kiſſed his feete, it made him the bolder with his
ſucceſſour. The pretence that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> tooke holde vpon to
withſtand the emperour was this. <hi>Philippicus</hi> vpon good war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
out of Gods word,<note place="margin">The controuerſie concerning ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</note> did forbid images, and commande them
to be aboliſhed, in which the idolatrous biſhop <hi>Conſtantine</hi> did
withſtand him. Afterward <hi>Leo</hi> the third being Emperour, and
maintaining that good cauſe againſt images, <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
that was ſucceſſour vnto <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> tooke greater mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in hand againſt the emperour. For he tooke from <hi>Leo</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
belonging to the empire, the <hi>Longobards</hi> had left in all
<hi>Italy An.</hi> 729. I report theſe ſtories out of <hi>Onuphrius,</hi> a great
friend to the pope, and Romiſh church. He alſo in the ſame place
ſpeaking of another pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the third who was next after
the ſecond telleth how he ſought for aide of the French, againſt
thoſe <hi>Longobards.</hi> For indeede he reiecting his natural prince,
to whom in duty he was bound, the Emperour, did ſeeke as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
he had gotten to be aboue al biſhops, ſo in the end, to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
al princes and potentates in the earth. Whereof <hi>Gregory</hi>
the third in this place layeth a good foundation, in reiecting an
old maiſter, for a new friend. Yea he doth excommunicat <hi>Leo</hi>
the Emperour, and depriue him to his empire, as <hi>Platina</hi> repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth.
Thus we ſee how the pope hath by little and little,<note place="margin">In Greg. 3.</note> gotten
to maſter the Emperour himſelfe. For as in theſe popes, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:7294:72"/>
hereof was laid, ſo afterwards it grewe more and more
vntil at the length the emperours were but their vaſſals and at
their commandement. But how they vſed this their immoderat
power muſt be afterwards declared, if God wil. Now as this
vnſatiable ambition, muſt needs be odious vnto, and hated of
that mightieſt monarch,<note place="margin">Reuel. 19. 16. Math. 28. 18.</note> King of Kings and Lorde of Lordes,
to whom al power in heauen and earth is giuen (for if he could

who ſhould be chiefe, howe much leſſe can he abide that
they ſhould deſpiſe his lieutenants,<note place="margin">Their practiſes to keepe them great ſtill.</note> to aduance themſelus?) ſo did
they aſſure themſelues, that it would be enuied at, and ſpited of
men. And here therefore they want not their practiſes, to keepe
them in this higheſt eſtate, to controll and command euen whom
they wil, at their pleaſures.</p>
            <p>Firſt becauſe none ſhould be ſo bold as to ſpeake any thing<note place="margin">Epitom. Eron.</note>
againſt their pride, it was made by pope <hi>Pius</hi> the ſecond periury
or againſt the oath of a biſhop,<note place="margin">Pcriury to ſpeake truth of the pope</note> to ſpeake and thing againſt the

make the pope to be eſteemed as neere of kinne to God himſelfe<note place="margin">Preſat. in Expoſ. Simbol. Apoſtol.</note>
as might be. For the expounder of the creede in <hi>Ciprians</hi> works
ſaith the like of God, that it is dangerous to ſpeake the truth of
him. But his meaning is that our weaknes and wants will not
let vs ſo ſpeake of him as we ſhould: And the popes feare is,
that if we ſpeake truth of him we muſt ſpeake otherwiſe then he
would haue vs, or were for his honeſty. Nowe biſhops hauing
their tongues and pens thus bridled, who durſt venture to finde
any fault? If for them to ſpeak the truth be periury what ſhould
it be thought in others? And thus becauſe he ſaw, that to haue
the truth of popes doings known, it would be a burning ſhame,
he full wiſely laieth this blocke in that way, and thus maketh vp
that gappe.</p>
            <p>And after commeth in to ſerue their turne that fulneſſe of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,<note place="margin">Power of the keies.</note>
and power of the keies, which they would ſo ſeeme to
haue from Chriſt as that none but they ſhould rule that ſterne,
none but they, ſhould haue that iuriſdiction. So that if they
curſe none can bleſſe, if they excommunicate, none may abſolue,
if they binde, no man may looſe.</p>
            <p>Wherein they challenge ſo great priuiledge, that they can
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:7294:73"/>
worke thereby againſt the law of God, the lawe of nature, the
law of nations.<note place="margin">Releaſing ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects of their duty of obedience.</note> They can (if you will that they will tell you)
releaſe the ſubiectes, from the bond of obedience, which they owe
to their magiſtrates, and the children, they can cauſe to rebell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
their parents.</p>
            <p>A perilons practiſe is this for all princes eſtates, thus to lead
the people on the blind ſide, as to make them beleeue, that to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel
is to obey and to diſhonour their ſuperiours, is an acceptable
ſacrifice to God.</p>
            <p>By theſe their powerfull keies,<note place="margin">Immunities of the clergy.</note> they alſo open the dore of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities
and priuiledges of the clergy, whereby they are exempt
from all corrections and puniſhmentes, vnleſſe forſooth it pleaſe
his holines, to deliuer them to the ſecular power, to make them
his hangmen.</p>
            <p>But of their owne authority they may not touch him, becauſe
they are (ſay they) the Lordes annointed. By which meanes
they grew to great ſawcines, and the ſtate was not a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered
thereby in many places.</p>
            <p>They had alſo another practiſe to maintaine their pride,<note place="margin">Shrift.</note> and
hold them in their high ſeate: That is auricular confeſſion, or
that which we call ſhrift. For vnder colour of being ghoſtly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
the Popes ſubtill and ſworne friendes, had acceſſe to prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
had conference with their counſellours, had knowledge of
their ſecrets, had opportunity to practiſe with their falſe and
faithleſſe ſubiectes, and they might, and did take al occaſions, by
terrifying the conſciences of princes, in reſpect of their ſinnes,
which they made knowne to them, as if there were no hope of
mercy at the hands of God, if firſt they were not reconciled to the
Holy Father the Pope, and the holy mother the Church of
Rome.</p>
            <p>And thus were they euery way diſtreſſed, their conſciences
being intangled, and their eſtates indangered. But one of their
moſt ſubtill ſhiftes was the taking away of knowledge from the
people. Whereby they became as men, that walked in the
darke,<note place="margin">Ignorance.</note> in an vnknowne way. They neuer knewe whether they
did right or wrong. They knew not their own duty. They were
taught to beleeue as the church beleeued.</p>
            <p>Now although they heard much of the church of Rome, yet
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:7294:73"/>
for the moſt parte they were not acquainted with it. So that
the church that muſt be their direction,<note place="margin">What it is in the Romiſh lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage to beleeue the church.</note> muſt be their parſon or
vicar or perchance their biſhop. Who if he would leade them
out of the way, they muſt needs go wrong. Becauſe their light
of knowledge, was quite put out.</p>
            <p>The Scriptures were either quite taken from them,<note place="margin">The ſcriptures ether quite taken away, or corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> and
mens dreames and deuiſes deliuered, to the lay people inſteede
of them: or els they were ſo corrupted, with fooliſh gloſes, and
ſo mingled, with mens traditions, that the true ſence and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of them was ſtil vnder a buſhell, ſo that it gaue no light at
all to them.</p>
            <p>Nowe they not knowing their duty, which God had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
them to performe to magiſtrates, howe eaſily might
they be drawen aſide from the ſame? Yea they through ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
not beeing able to put a difference betweene trueth
and falſehoode, howe readily might they be moued to thinke
it to be true that they doe ſay vnto them, who were onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
and taken for holy Church, that the Pope is Chriſtes
Vicar: that he is ſo much more excellent then any worldly po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentate,
as the ſoule is better then the body: that there is no
leſſe difference betweene the glory of the Emperour and the
pope, then is betweene the brightneſſe of the Sunne and of the
Moone. The pope being like the Sunne, and the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
compared to the. Moone which hath her light from the
Sunne.</p>
            <p>Theſe and other ſuch like blaſphemies againſt the maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
whome God hath placed vpon earth, were accompted
good doctrine, and ſtrong proofes through want of knowledge.
And this very effect that ignorance did worke, whereby the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
brokers for the church of Rome, did ſee themſelues and their
maſters eſteemed halfe as Gods, and their meſſages receiued
more readily, and more conſtantly kept, and more willingly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beied,
then gods word by a great deale, made them to proclaime
ſo lowde, and ſo ſtiffly to maintaine, that ignorance is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of deuotion.</p>
            <p>And why ſhould they not,<note place="margin">Ignorance ſay they mother of deuotion.</note> when they ſee that princes
are readye, by reaſon of their ignoraunce in Gods trueth,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:7294:74"/>
to be led and guided by ſuch blind guides, euen to the hazarding
of their kingdoms? And the people therby are withdrawen from

whereby the popes drawe the people into great admiration
of them.<note place="margin">Pardons and agnus deis.</note> Namely, their pardons and indulgences, their <hi>agnus

And who would not giue all that he hath, if he might attaine to
theſe benefites? who would not ſell the whole earth to winne
heauen? Who would not looſe his life, to ſaue his ſoule? But
the ſunne-ſhine of knowledge would eaſily driue away all ſuch
miſts. And they who in their blindeneſſe do eſteeme that man
of ſinne that ſitteth at Rome, to be more then halfe a god, and
ſee nothing but greatneſſe in him,<note place="margin">Marke 8. 24.</note> as the blinde man of Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaida,

they ſhall then ſee, the biſhop of Rome as he is indeede, to be an
enemy to God and man, a ſubuerter of eſtates, a foe to prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:7294:74"/>
a ſnare to ſubiects, and a very corrupter of true chriſtianitie

            <p>And thus much of the ſhifts and ſleights that the Biſhop of
Rome vſed to come to his greatneſſe, by little and little, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to that that now we ſee. Sometime vſing flattery, falſhood
and forgery, yea, and afterwards bringing the emperour vnder

when emperors were either otherwiſe imployed in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires,
or hated for their life, or ſome way ſo diſtreſſed, that they
could not withſtand him and his partakers, then would hee moſt
earneſtly purſue and perſecute them, vntill he had his wil, which
I truſt will appeare plainely in the diſcourſe that now I am to

before: but it is alſo (in my iudgement) very neceſſary, that
we looke ſomewhat into his doings, and examine how hee hath
ruled and raigned, what good he hath done to the church, what
profit he hath brought to the chriſtian common-wealth. When
God did ſee the continuall rebellion of his people, that they
would by no meanes be reclaimed from ſinne, and howe little
good it had wrought in them, that they had beene very lately in
a grieuous captiuitie: he then by his prophet <hi>Zachary</hi> chapter
11. verſe. 16. threatneth vnto them this great and grieuous
plague, that he will raiſe vp a ſheepeheard in the land, which
ſhall not looke for the thing that is loſt, nor ſeeke the tender
lambes, nor heale that that is hurt, nor feede that that ſtandeth
vp, but he ſhall eate the fleſh of the fat, and teare their clawes in

God by his prophet <hi>Ezechiel</hi> chapter 34. verſes 2, 3, 4. doeth

but feed them not, they ſtrengthen not the weake, they heale not
the ſicke, binde not vp the broken, bring not againe that which
was driuen away, ſeeke not the loſt, but rule them with crueltie
and rigor: I neuer reade or thinke of this deſcription of an euill
ſhepheard, but I ſee (me thinkes) therein a right paterne of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
gouernment. Neither doe I at any time earneſtly enter
into ſcanning of that regiment, that is vnder that moſt holy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but I remember how the holy ghoſt painteth out theſe
proude, cruel and idoll ſhepeheards. The one ſeemeth to bee ſo
right a paterne of the other, as if they were all one thing, and no
difference at all betweene them: or as if the Spirite of God did
both foreſee and foreſhew the moſt holy father, in that glaſſe of
the moſt vnholy ſhepheard. But that it may the better appeare
that he that would be accounted the herd of Chriſts flocke, doth
but ſeek for to ſatiſfie his own pride, profit and pleaſure, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

taketh from him his titles that belong to him onely. And firſt he
calleth himſelfe head of the vniuerſall church, which name ſo
properly belongeth vnto Chriſt, that we cannot giue it to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
without great wrong, both to the head and the body of the
church. To the head, in that the office which God the father laid
vpon Chriſt, in appointing him ouer all things the head to the
church,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 1.</note> ſhuld be beſtowed vpon a ſinful man: to the body which
is Chriſts church, becauſe by that meanes it ſhould haue but an
idle head, euery way vnable to performe the dueties of a head.
I deny not but the church of Rome, for 4 or 5 hundred yeres af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Chriſt, might iuſtly be called the head of the church, that is a
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:7294:75"/>
ring leader to other churches in reſpect of religion which remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
more ſincere there then elſewhere for many yeares, neither
was that church ſo troubled with hereſies as were others. I
confes alſo that ſom of the biſhops of Rome, for their forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
learning, and paines, imployed to the benefit of the church,
might worthely be called in ſome ſence heads of the church, as in
the firſt parte of this treatiſe I haue ſhewed. Then will ſome
man ſay, what is then the fault which you charge the biſhop of
Rome withall, in calling himſelfe the head of the vniuerſall
church? Firſt that he maketh that name proper to him and his
ſeate, which many times more iuſtly belonged vnto others, who
for their learning and trauel, for the church of God, deſerued
much better of Gods church then any pope of them al.</p>
            <p>Further alſo that it is not, that ſignification of the name
head, that will ſatiſfie the popes ambitious humour, thereby
to be counted a man, onely able or fit to guide and direct others,
but he will ſo be a head, that hee muſt commaund, forbid, bind,
looſe, retaine, remit, diſpence, denie, doe, and vndoe, as his
vnbridled affection, ſhould carie him. Which ſoueraigne power
ouer the church or any parte of the church, we cannot find that
God gaue vnto any man, either <hi>Peter,</hi> or <hi>Paul,</hi> yea or to Chriſt
himſelfe as man onely (for he was taught of his father what to
doe, and what to ſay) much leſſe then would his vicar of Rome,
if he had but one ſparke of chriſtian humilitie, claime ſuch abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
power, ouer the whole earth. Seeing therefore by this
name head, hee chalengeth greater power then either any good
man would haue in Gods church (for the godly can be content to
ſpeake of God as God teacheth them, and to doe as hee woulde
haue them) or is fit for any man to haue, as his vnruly doings
do ſufficiently declare: we iuſtly denie, that euer any biſhop of
Rome, was of the godly called the head of the church, in that
ſence that it is now vſed, as their doings doe plainly teach vs.
As for the name <hi>Papa</hi> or pope it was a common name to all
biſhops as is confeſſed by <hi>Baronius,</hi> yea and graunted alſo in
this place by maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe. And it ſignifieth as
much as father or grandfather, ſo that it ſeemeth, that it was
firſt giuen vnto biſhops by godly chriſtians, who did honour
and reuerence them for their calling. And why may not this
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:7294:76"/>
name, be aptly giuen to any diligent biſhoppe or paſtour, in the
church of god?<note place="margin">Lib. 2. cap. 31.</note> No maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> wil haue this name after
a more particular maner to be giuen to the biſhop of Rome, then
to any other.<note place="margin">Match. 23. 9.</note> Then we muſt learne of Chriſt not to call any man
our father vpon earth. For there is but one, our father which is
in heauen. And therefore if he wil otherwiſe be our father then
man may be our father, let him ſeeke for other children, for to
ſuch a father we owe no obedience.</p>
            <p>The name of vniuerſal biſhop,<note place="margin">Vniuerſall biſh. Actione. 3.</note> was giuen in the councill of
<hi>Chalcedon</hi> to the biſhop of Rome, maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> telleth
vs. We deny it not. But without a fauourable and good vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
that title may be very odious. For euen <hi>Gregory</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
a biſhop of Rome, and no man more vehemently, inueieth
againſt that proud title in many plaids. His places are ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
alleadged that I neede not come to any particular.<note place="margin">Bellar anſ. to that we obiect out of the odious name of vniner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal biſhop.</note> But
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> going about to deliuer this title, from all ſuſpition
of antichriſtian ambition, telleth vs that this name vniuerſall bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
may be taken in two ſorts. One way that a vniuerſall bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
ſhould ſignifie an only biſhop,<note place="margin">Vniuerſal biſhop an only biſhop.</note> that is ſuch a one as woulde
haue none to be biſhop but himfelfe onely. And ſuch a vniuerſall
biſhop ſaith maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> condemneth.
And doth he not otherwiſe condemne <hi>Iohn</hi> of Conſtantinople
his pride, but becauſe he would haue no biſhop but himſelfe? No
maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> the ſtories are more plaine,<note place="margin">A reply againſt that anſwere.</note> then that ſuch
ſhifts may go for currant. The controuerſie was, whether the
biſhop of Conſtantinople ſhould be as now the biſhop of Rome
is in his owne account, a biſhop aboue al biſhops.</p>
            <p>Read all the hiſtories and it wil eaſily appeare, his indeuour
was only to haue the commanding of other biſhops. Neither
could he be called vniuerſal, if he were the only biſhop but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the ſingular biſhop. But maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> bringeth two
or three teſtimonies out of <hi>Gregory</hi> wherein he complaineth
that <hi>Iohn</hi> patriarch of Conſtantinople would be biſhop alone.
<hi>Gregories</hi> meaning is plaine enough, that he ſaith he would on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be biſhop, becauſe he only would haue the commanding of all,
that others ſhould indeede be his ſuffraganes, and at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
which reaſon of <hi>Gregory</hi> againſt that title of vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall
biſhop, if it be wel marked, giueth I thinke a wound vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:7294:76"/>
to the church of Rome. A ſoueraigne authoritie in one
to commaund all (ſaith he) is to take away all biſhops but that
one onely, but ſuch ſoueraigne authoritie ouer biſhops the pope
doth chalenge in this name of vniuerſall biſhop, as experience
teacheth: therefore he maketh him ſelfe the onely biſhop. And
this is the thing that <hi>Gregorie</hi> ſo miſlyketh in <hi>Iohn</hi> biſhop of
<hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> therefore I cannot ſee how it can be tolerable
in him of Rome. But one may be called a vniuerſall biſhop
(ſaith he) in another ſence, as he hath a care of the whole church,
and ſo the Pope may be called a vniuerſall Biſhop. But here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> giueth very litle authoritie to the biſhop
of Rome.<note place="margin">Tom 2. anno 187</note> For this generall care belongeth not onely to euery
Biſhop, but alſo to euery Chriſtian as <hi>Caeſar Paronius</hi> doeth
plainly confeſſe,<note place="margin">De bonis operib. in part. li. 2. c. 24.</note> of whom maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth write, that he
is a ſingular good man, and without all doubt moſt learned.
And therefore I truſt hee will by him be perſwaded, to let this
name of vniuerſall biſhop be a name that may belong to mo then
to him of Rome, and ſo not to make it his peculiar title. A
fourth name of his,<note place="margin">Moſt holy,</note> is that hee is called moſt holy. And here
maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth maruelouſly inſult ouer maſter <hi>Luther</hi>
for inſinuating that the names of moſt high, and moſt holy, had
not beene hard of in the dayes of <hi>Gregorie.</hi> Maſter <hi>Luther</hi> ſaid
not ſo, maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> onely feared that he ment ſome ſuch
matter, and therefore quareleth with him and telleth him that
he lieth.<note place="margin">Conc. Chale. actione 3. obiect. Anſwer.</note> Well, <hi>Leo</hi> the pope is called moſt holy in three ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
titles, that three <hi>Graecians</hi> wrote to him. It is true maſter
<hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and in the ſame action in a great number of places
beſids, the biſhops yelding their conſent, do call him moſt holy.
He is there alſo called holy, and why would not that name holy,
which is there alſo giuen to him,<note place="margin">The title of Moſt holy giuen to ſundry.</note> as well content the biſhop of
Rome now, as to be called moſt holy? Or why ſhould that be a
peculiare name to him alone, that was giuen in that place as
well to others as to him? For <hi>Anatolius</hi> the patriarch of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi>
is often called moſt holy. Yea and the council
writeth vnto <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> whome
they depriued of his dignitie, becauſe he was a manitainer of
<hi>Futiches</hi> that notable heretick, yet I ſay, the conncill writing
vnto him, doe call him alſo moſt holy. And whoſoeuer marketh
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:7294:77"/>
that councill, ſhall ſee no titles more common, then moſt holy,
moſt bleſſed or happie, mow beloued of God, and ſuch like.
Neither were theſe things giuen vnto them as names to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
to them and their ſeate, but onely ſuch titles, as they thought
well beſtowed vpon ſuch perſons, as they vſed them to. As <hi>Leo</hi>
biſhop of Rome, who although he were not without his infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
yet ſure he was a man of great gifts. And they in aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of affection towardes him, called him moſt holy. Muſt
it therefore be a name hereditary to that ſinfull and ſhameleſſe
broode that ſince hath ſprong vp in that place? It were abſurd
to thinke, that coniurers, inchaunters, poyſeners, adulterers,
and ſuch ruffians and rakehelles, ſhould be called by right of
their ſeat moſt holy. And yet now nothing more common then
this title. His fauourites muſt not ſpeake of him, but with this
tearme of moſt holy. Looke all his bulles and writings, and
you ſhall ſee, that hee that is moſt vnholy before God and men,
yet by a lying ſtile muſt be called moſt holy. Yea to doubt
whether it be a fit name for his holineſſe forſooth or not, is a
ſinne more to be puniſhed then the breach of Gods lawe if it be
true that <hi>Gentiletus</hi> writing againſt the council of Trent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth
of a biſhop that was put out of his biſhopricke,<note place="margin">Li. 5. Nullitate 11</note> becauſe
in that council he miſliked that the pope ſhould be called moſt
holy, and God in the ſcriptures is called but holie. And indeede
he might iuſtly miſlike it, if he duely conſidered that in God hee
could not ſee any thing like vnto ſinne, in the pope almoſt no
ſparke of goodneſſe in theſe latter ages. And, this I take to be
the reaſon why maſter <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> doth not place among the
fifteene names that he hath found out for the pope, this name
moſt holy, becauſe in reſpect of his vnholineſſe, he thinketh it
pitie to beſtow that name vpon him. And therefore he ſhould
the rather haue borne with maſter <hi>Luther,</hi> if hee did maruell
that the popes flatterers, would ſo prophane that holy title,
in beſtowing it vpon ſo vnholy men, as for the moſt parte
they haue all beene, which theſe many hundred of yeares
haue ſit in that ſeate. Or at the leaſt hee would not haue giu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
the lie to maſter <hi>Luther,</hi> for ſignifying that Saint <hi>Gregorie</hi>
would haue miſliked the abuſe of that name in theſe dayes.
As for the name of Chriſts vicar,<note place="margin">Chriſts vicor.</note> which is alſo one of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:7294:77"/>
title, wee would not much ſticke to beſtow it vpon him
our ſelues,<note place="margin">Chriſt hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vicars.</note> if he would content himſelfe with that place where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

pray the people to be reconciled to God. But this is too ſmall a

He is worthie to be Chriſts vicar generall, becauſe hee is with
the church in all places, yea if it bee in priſons and dungeons.
But this vicar of Rome, as he can not be euery where if he

But ſeeing ſpirituall fathers,<note place="margin">Iames 1. 18. 1. Pet. 1. 23.</note> muſt beget children to God by the
word of truth, and by the ſeede not mortall, but by the immortall
ſeede of the worde of God which ſeede they loue not to ſowe (for
a preaching pope in our dayes is as a blacke ſwan) they cannot
therefore get ſpirituall children vnto God, &amp; therefore as I ſaid
before I cannot ſee, that they can be ſpirituall fathers. If they be
called fathers in reſpect of their age, and ſo it be vſed as a name
of reuernce, wee enuie then not that name in ſuch ſort, ſo that
they take it not from other, to make it proper to them. And theſe
are the names which are commonly giuen in our days to the B.
of Rome. As for the reſt of his titles becauſe we hear them not
attributed to popes now, I omit. Sauing that I muſt put you
in remembrance of one blaſphemous name, which although it

be not a name by which he is commonly called, yet it is giuen to
him as his due, and maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> becauſe he would not

the Baptiſt acknowledging that he hath no right in the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goomes
wife, but is only a friend to the bridegroome. As alſo
he maketh the bridegroome him only, that is lord ouer the whole
earth. And he maketh his argument ſtrong againſt <hi>Donatus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the church hath but one huſband, which is Chriſt, therefore
<hi>Donatus</hi> is not that huſband, nor can be. But if maſter <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi>

may be an other vnder him, <hi>Donatus</hi> might as well haue clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to be that huſband then, that the pope doth claime now to
be. But it was not then known, that one honeſt woman, might
haue two huſbands. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> aſſo and <hi>Theophilact</hi> and
all the ancient fathers make Chriſt the onely huſband, yea and
<hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> thinketh,<note place="margin">Hom. 28.</note> that he needeth fauourably to interpret
that, that <hi>Iohn</hi> calleth himſelfe the friend of the bridegroome,
ſhewing that he meant not thereby to make himſelfe equall to
Chriſt, but only to expreſſe the greatnes of his ioy. For a friend
reioiceth more then a ſeruant. What would he haue ſaid then to
theſe ſawcy mates, who thinke too baſe a thing for them to be
but friends to the bridegroome, but the bridegroome and they
muſt haue all one wife? I cannot therfore maruel much at their
flattering lawyers, that wil make the pope and Chriſt to haue

that he ſeeth all their doings ſo directly contrary to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> name, that
he thinketh it not a name due to them, or fit for them. For what
mockery is it, to write themſelues ſeruants of Gods ſeruants,
perchance ſometime in the ſelfe ſame letters, wherein they will
command, controll, correct, condemne the mightieſt monarches
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:7294:79"/>
vnder heauen, <hi>Gregory</hi> would thereby haue taught them mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie,
humility, meeknes, and ſuch other chriſtian vertues, yea,
and alſo a painefull diligence for the good of the church, as if in
all things they ſhould carefully ſeek, not their own profit or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment,
but Gods glory, and the benefit of Gods people (for
ſeruants worke not for themſelues but for their maſter.) They
keeping ſtill the name, by that outward profeſſion of lowlineſſe
and induſtry, ſeeke to caſt a miſt before the eies of the ignorant,
that they ſhall not ſee them, when they ſhew themſelues in truth
ſo proude and preſumptuous againe all men, ſo lither and loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
in their paſtorall functio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as if they were enimies to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
and had no care at al of their owne duty.</p>
            <p>But now let vs ſee to what end M.<note place="margin">Why theſe names are giuen to the Pope.</note> 
               <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth intitle
the B. of Rome to thoſe names of Head, Pope, vniuerſall Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,
Chriſts vicar, Father and Bridegroome, euen to this end,
that he may prooue him to haue the charge of the whole church.
I on the other ſide ſhew, that theſe are not his titles, they are
not his ornaments, they belong to Chriſt moſt of them, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to him, if the be vnderſtoode in peculiar ſorte, as maſter <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi>
would haue them. They may be giuen, after ſome ſort,
to all paſtors. But the B. of Rome cannot abide to be but like
others, he muſt be ſigular and fellowleſſe, or elſe nothing can
content him. Therefore I out of theſe names which hee ſo cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth
to himſelfe, do prooue his pride and preſumption aboue
men, thus to extoll himſelfe ſo exceſſiuely aboue others, yea, and
blaſphenues againſt Chriſt, thus to wring from him, his office
and priuileges, and to make the world to beleeue, they are his
owne. And this is one of the effects that followed of this ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of power which by little and little (as before I ſhewed) the
Pope aſpired and attained vnto. And euer as he grew in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
ſo did he in pride alſo, vntil he could not tell how to call him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
or what name he ſhould giue himſelfe, that his greatneſſe
thereby might ſufficiently be expreſſed: yet all theſe proude ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
coulde not ſatiſfie or content the proude humour of many of
theſe Popes, but that they grew to farther impiety and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
if greater may be. For, as in theſe names they made the
whole church to be (not Chriſts) but as it were their owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance,
and their owne houſe, with which, and wherein they
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:7294:79"/>
thought they might do as themſelues would, and they incroched
alſo exceedingly vpon Chriſt his right: ſo at the length, they
came to that contempt of God and godlines, that their paraſites
would giue vnto them,<note place="margin">The Pope god.</note> and they could be content to take the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
that was due to God only. They wil not ſo much as leaue
to God his name, but euen that is beſtowed vpon the pope. To
beleeue (ſaith one) that our lord god the pope,<note place="margin">Extrauag. Iob. 22.</note> could not do this
thing, is to be counted hereſie. And another ſaith, When the
pope diſſolueth a marriage it muſt be thought to be Gods doing
onely, becauſe the pope being choſen according to the cannons,
is god vpon earth. And another, <hi>Innocentius</hi> the third, The

becauſe the good emperour <hi>Conſtantine</hi> (ſaieth he) did call the

for that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> did ſpeake of al biſhops (alluding to that,
I haue ſaid,<note place="margin">Pſal. 82, 1, 6.</note> ye are gods: And God ſtandeth in the aſſemblie of
gods, and iudgeth among gods, the prophet ſpeaking there of
Princes and Iudges) that doeth hee applie to himſelfe alone.
Whoſoeuer readeth that which is alleadged out of an Epiſtle
of <hi>Gregorie</hi> vnto <hi>Mauritius</hi> the Emperour,<note place="margin">Cauſ. 11. q. 1. cap. Sacerdotibus.</note> ſhall find this
falſe dealing of Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> to make himſelfe a god after
ſom other ſort, then <hi>Conſtantine</hi> there calleth al biſhops gods.
The Iewes were ſuperſtitious, ſo as they durſt not name
that name of God <hi>Iehouah,</hi> for feare of offending that great
god: The popes are ſawcie, that make no ſcruple at all to take
to themſelues that name, of the which we ought not to ſpeake
or thinke, but with great reuerence. Whether nowe are the
honeſter, the Iewes, or the Pope. The Iewes were too ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous.
But the Popes yet, that haue caſt off all reuerence
of the maieſtie of God, are farre more blame worthy. And
this very name (as I ſuppoſe) that they called themſelues
gods, did ſo imbolden ſome of them, to ſet ſo little by God. As
for example, Pope <hi>Iulius.</hi> not the ſecond, that was the luſtie
warriour, but the third, that filthie beaſt, if Stories doe

ſaid it was not wholſome for him.<note place="margin">Popes ſaucy with God.</note> I will haue it ſaith he in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite
of God. At another time miſſing a peacock which he had
commaunded to be kept colde againſt night, hee burſt into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie
of choller, whereupon a cardinall mouing him to be
quiet, What ſaid he was God angry for an aple, in ſo much as
he caſt our firſt parents out of paradice for that matter, and may
not I being his vicar, be angrie for my peacock? The irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
heart, of this prophane pope, could neuer haue burſt out,
iuto ſuch blaſphemies againſt God, but that in his exceſſe of
pride he eſteemed himſelfe as God, or elſe in affection euen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſotted
with atheiſme, hee ſaid as did the wicked in the prophet
<hi>Dauid.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 53. 1.</note> There is no God. And ſo hee proued that to be moſt

honour hath no vnderſtanding, he is like to the beaſts that periſh.
And thus we ſee howe the biſhop of Rome, being drunken,
with too wel liking of himſelfe in his authoritie and high eſtate,
did not only exalt himſelfe by his names aboue al men, but made
himſelfe equall euen with the moſt high. But leaſt the biſhop of
Rome, ſhould ſeeme to be but God in name, and not in deede,
as a ſhadow without a bodie, and title without authoritie, (as
were <hi>Paul</hi> the third his archbiſhops that he ſent to the council of

aſcend aboue the height of the clouds,<note place="margin">Eſa. 14. 14.</note> and I will be like the moſt
Higheſt.</p>
            <p>If I would indeuour to ſet downe all that might be ſaid of
the pride of the biſhop of Rome or at the leaſt of his impudent
affection of his claw-backs, it were harder to find an outgate
then an entrance, this field is ſo large to wander in. For what
is it that the Pope can not doe? Yea what can God himſelfe
doe more then hee? If wee will truſt flattering Lawyeares,
in their approued and allowed bookes, he is Chriſts vitar gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
ouer heauen, earth, and hell, ouer angels good and bad,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:7294:80"/>
yea they tell vs, that the pope can doe whatſoeuer God can doe,
except ſinne. It ſeemeth that they meane God can ſinne, but
the pope is ſo clad with holineſſe, and compaſſed about with
righteous dealing as with a garment, that hee can in no wiſe
ſinne, ſuch a ſtaine cannot be in his fleſh, ſuch a clog cannot hang
at his backe. O proud blaſphemie! Can that man of ſinne (for
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doubtleſſe ſpeaketh of him) iuſtly ſo called,<note place="margin">2. Theſſal, 2. 3.</note> becauſe
he is a ſtumbling block to others, and a cauſe of ſinne to many
thouſands, and himſelfe alſo often a ſeruant or rather a ſincke
of ſinne, can he (I ſay) be without ſinne? Yea they tell vs that
he may,<note place="margin">Diſt. 40. cap. Non nor.</note> and that by the authoritie of pope <hi>Symmacus,</hi> who
doth teſtifie that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> did bequeath the euerlaſting gift
of <hi>Merites,</hi> together with the in heritance of innocencie to his
poſteritie. In ſomuch as if they haue not merits enough, yet
that ſufficeth that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> hath done. He addeth the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
becauſe he (I thinke he meaneth Saint <hi>Peter</hi>) either doth
aduaunce them that are worthie, or doth lighten ſuch as are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunced.
Now if the pope himſelfe will ſay, that he in reſpect
of his chaire, hath a ſucceſſion of innocencie, it is no great mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel
if his flatterers will ſay he cannot ſinne.</p>
            <p>But if all the popes and their paraſites, would crie it out
neuer ſo loud, yet ſo long as their owne ſtories are remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they ſhal be proued liers. Where are now theſe cenſurers
and ſeuere forbidders of Gods writings? Why vſe they not
their authoritie to repreſſe ſuch blaſphemies? The Romiſh
church,<note place="margin">Ind. expurgat.</note> can take vpon them to prohibit the writings of godly
men, yea if there be but a note in the margent of the fathers,
word for word out of the fathers, whereby the reader may
perchaunce be directed more readily, to ſee the iudgement
of that father in ſome point in controuerſie, although it change
not the meaning of that place yet our ſeuere cenſurers ſtill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
that it be left out. But theſe horrible blaſphemies,
whereof al men may iuſtly be a ſhamed, are not once miſliked of,
ſound not out of time, but are melodius muſicke in the eares of
ſuch holie fathers. Can we hope for any good from them, that
call light darkneſſe, and darkneſſe light, euil good, and good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill?
I feare ſuch bad trees, can bring forth no good fruit. But
to come to ſome particular points.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:7294:81"/>
Let vs ſee what this petty God, doth take vpon him, and how
he plaieth the God indeede? For as I haue ſaid the bare name of
God (although it be far too much, that it ſhould be giuen him by
others, or acknowledged of himſelfe) wil not pleaſe him, but he
muſt alſo doe as God doth. And firſt whereas Chriſt is our on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
lawmaker and maſter, as Chriſt himſelfe telleth vs, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Saint <hi>Iames</hi> alſo exhorteth vs that we be not many ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters:<note place="margin">Matth. 23. 8. Iam. 3. 1.</note>

did Chriſt and his apoſtles, (whoſe footſteps he ſhould not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed
to follow) but he will teach vs his owne leſſons, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer
vs his owne doctrines. And although he pretend the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of Gods ſpirit,<note place="margin">obiection.</note> yet euen hereby it appeareth, that this is
but a lying pretence and coulour, wherewith they would cloke
all their hereſies and ſuperſtitions.<note place="margin">Anſwere. Ioh. 16. 13. What the ſpirit teacheth.</note> For the ſpirit ſhal not ſpeake
of himſelfe, but whatſoeuer he ſhall heare, that ſhall he ſpeake.
Aud this reaſon our Sauiour Chriſt yeeldeth why the ſpirite
ſhall lead vs into all truth, becauſe he ſhall teach nothing of his
own, but that which he ſhall heare. Therefore all new doctrines,
euen whatſoeuer hath beene added in ſubſtance of doctrine, vnto
that which Chriſt and his apoſtles left vs, ſauoureth of another
ſpirit, and not of that ſpirit of God, which ſhall teach or ſuggeſt
nothing, but that which he hath heard. What a maſter then,
is that great maſter, not in Iſraell, but in Italy, that bringeth
in huge heapes of doctrine, which themſelues confeſſe onely to
reſt vpon mens traditions, which they call traditions of the
church, and haue no good warrant, or ſure ground in the word
of God? Doeth he not take vpon him Gods office? Doeth he
not make himſelfe herein equall with God? It is moſt plaine,
it cannot be denied. But the infatiable ambition of thoſe holy
fathers, will not ſuffer them to content themſelues with that
exceſſe of pride, in that they take vpon them as God, to make
lawes,<note place="margin">The pope con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troleth gods word. Heb 13. 4. 1. Cor. 7. 2. 9.</note> and giue rules to Gods church, vnleſſe they alſo control
and correct as ſeemeth good to them, thoſe lawes which God
hath ſet downe, and thoſe ordinances which he hath eſtabliſhed
in making that ſin which he calleth honourable, and forbidding
that which he hath commanded, as appeareth in their forbidding
certaine perſons to marry.</p>

he ſaith, ſo it muſt be, and there muſt no reaſon be aſked of his
doing. Whereby it appeareth that the Pope being the church,
and as we ſee, hauing the ful authoritie to do what he will in the
church of Rome, they tell vs that the ſcripture hath no authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
or ſtrength but from him? And I pray you then who is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?
hee that maketh the word authenticall, or hee that hath his
word approoued? Is not he that doth approoue it? ſo God muſt
be vnder the pope, that holy God, vnder a vile ſinfull man.
Fourthly, the pope will take vpon him to diſpence with, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
againſt the word of God, and to allow that which God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly
condemneth, and is expreſly againſt gods holy law. For
proofe whereof, I neede not alleadge the falſe teſtimony of his
flattering lawyers, that giue him that power to diſpenſe againſt
the apoſtle, and ſo againſt gods word: but we may ſee his prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe,
which doth ſufficiently teſtifie, that he thinketh he may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe,
with the wicked and vnnaturall vncouering of the ſhame
of them, that are neare of kinne, And he hath done contrary to
this flat commaundement giuen by God againſt marying with
vncle or aunt.<note place="margin">Leuit. 20. 20.</note> In which caſe he did diſpenſe in the marriage of
his catholike ſonne <hi>Philip</hi> King of Spaine, who, as in his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous
ambition hee hath no meaſure, ſo in his vnnaturall
iuſt, he hath (as it ſeemeth) no ſhame: but to his Lord he ſhall
ſtand or fall, before whome it ſhall be tried one day, whether
the popes bull can ſtand betweene God and him, for breach of
Gods lawe. Yea, pope <hi>Martine</hi> the fifth (as is alleaged in a
booke called <hi>Brutum fulmen,</hi> out of <hi>Anthony</hi> of Florence and
others) did diſpenſe with one, to marry his owne ſiſter, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
God ſaieth, thou ſhalt not vncouer the ſhame of thy ſiſter.
But what can not the pope do? He can make wrong right, ſay
they:<note place="margin">Leuit. 18. 9.</note> And wee knowe, that hee can make that which is right
wrong. For hee can (as they tell vs) doe all things aboue
right, againſt right, and without right. Yea, hee is lorde of
lordes, and hath the authoritie of the King of kings, ouer his
ſubiects. But what will you more?</p>
            <p>To doubt of the popes power it is no leſſe then ſacrilege. As
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:7294:83"/>
alſo it is alleadged out of <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Aquine</hi> againſt the errors
of the grecians queſtion 66. That to ſay that the pope hath not
ſupremacy ouer the whole church, is like the errour of them, that

            <p>And is this that <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Aquine,</hi> that glorious Saint

            <p>In which reſpect I pray God hartely, that hee may nightly

of this land, which he and ſuch other tigers whelps ſo gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dely
gape for. And I doubt not, but our good God, which
hath hitherto very often, not mercifully onely, but miraculouſlie
alſo and mightely preſerued and vpholden, the only proppe and
ſtaie of this our flourſhing lande, will ſtill pleade her cauſe
againſt all her foes,<note place="margin">our ſins deſerue great plagues.</note> and preſerue her ſoule the ſoule of his
turtle Doue againſt all their ſecret and malitious practiſes. I
confeſle indeede, that our ſinnes which abound daily more and
more, doe iuſtly deſerue, that this pretious iewel, ſhould be tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
from vs. And it is onely Gods mercie, that hath preſerued
vs theſe many yeares, euen his free and great mercie. But if
we could turne to the Lord vnfainedly, we neede neither feare
the ſuites or teares, nor traiterous deuiſes, of ſuch hipocrites,
neither yet the might or malice of all thoſe conſpirators. But
if the Lord ſhould as in iuſtice he may giue vs ouer to be a prey
vnto their teeth, yet the truth of our cauſe is grounded ſtill vpon
Gods word. And the Iſraelites were Gods people ſtill, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
when they rebelled againſt the Lord, hee did ſometimes
deliuer them to be puniſhed, euen of his owne enemies, and
wicked ones.</p>
            <p>And I beſeech the Lorde make vs more patiently to beare
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:7294:83"/>
his deſerued wrath if it ſhall pleaſe him to lay it vpon vs, then
we haue vſed thankfully his vndeſerued grace and fauour, which
hetherto he hath ſhewed vnto vs, and continued amongſt vs.
And thus much by occation of that vndue commendation, that
<hi>Allen</hi> giueth vnto <hi>Thomas</hi> of Aquin. But him and ſuch like
I leaue to their owne fancies. And to the godly I ſay onely
with Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> my bretheren haue not the faith of our glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Lord Ieſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">Iames 2. 1.</note> in reſpect of perſons. Let our cares
be attentiue to marke, and our hearts ready bent to receaue that
which in due examination we find to be well ſpoken, without
beholding of the perſon, or regarding any thing more, then the
word that is taught. And thus haue I briefly ſhewed, how
this vniuſt authoritie which the pope chalengeth and into the
which moſt craftely hee crept, is in part moſt lewdly, by him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed,
not onely in that he claimeth to haue a proude name ouer
his bretheren, and the whole church, but alſo that he dare match
himſelfe with God, and directly to oppoſe himſelfe againſt his
will.</p>
            <p>But as in many things much, ſo in nothing more doth the
biſhop of Rome darken Gods glorie, or thruſt himſelfe into
Gods place, then, in that he being himſelfe a ſinfull man, yea a
ſeruant to ſinne, euen ſet and ſold to doe wickedly, dareth yet
take vpon him to forgiue ſinne:<note place="margin">The pope forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth ſinnes.</note> And that not as one that would
preach and proclame, vnto the penitent ſinners Gods grace
and mercy, but as one that commendeth vnto the people
his owne power to pardon and forgiue men their offences.
Wherein hee firſt offendeth,<note place="margin">God onely can pardon ſinnes.</note> in that he taketh more vpon him,
then belongeth to him, or to any man. For, ſeeing our ſinne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
act, whether it be againſt God or man, is therefore imputed
to vs as ſiune, and is indeede ſinne, becauſe it is a breach of
Gods Lawe; it is very abſurde to imagine that any man can
diſpenſe with vs for this ſinne,<note place="margin">1. Iohn 3. 4.</note> but only that good God, againſt
whoſe lawe we haue tranſgreſſed. And for this cauſe the godly
when their ſinne was vnto them a heauy burthen, haue made
their ſuite and mone vnto God, becauſe he onely can heale that
ſore, and helpe that ſickeneſſe, as that one example of <hi>Dauid</hi>
in ſteed of many, may prooue vnto vs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 1. Haue mercy
vpon me O Lord according to thy great mercie, and according
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:7294:84"/>
to the multitude of thy compaſſions,<note place="margin">Tibi ſoli peceaui.</note> put away mine iniquities.
And although his ſinnes were exceeding great (as after he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth)
yet becauſe none could pardon them but God only, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
euen to him he commeth, againſt whom he had offended, to
him,<note place="margin">Iob. 14. 4.</note> he confeſſeth his fault, of him, he ſeeketh for releaſe, to him,
he ſueth for pardon. For of all men it is true that <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith who
can make that cleane, that is conceiued of vncleane ſeede? there
is not one. And therefore God proclaimeth by his prophet <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay.</hi>
I,<note place="margin">Eſa. 43. 25.</note> euen I, am he that putteth away thine iniquities, for
mine owne ſake, and will not remember thy ſinnes. And firſt we
bowe the knees of our heart, to our good God, yeelding vnto
him immortall thankes and praiſe, who dealeth thus gratiou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly
with vs vnwoorthy and ſinnefull wretches, as that hee doth
not onely freely forgiue vs, for Chriſt his ſake, all our ſinnes,
and blot out all our offences, and put away all our tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
with an aſſured purpoſe, neuer to cal them to remembrance,
or to charge vs with them in his iuſt iudgement: but alſo for the
better quieting,<note place="margin">The miniſtery of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

giuen power and commandement to his miniſters, by proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to the penitent this his free pardon miniſterially to heale
the ſoule wounded with ſinne, to bind vp the broken and contrite
heart, and to raiſe by form the pit of deſpaire, them whom the
clog of conſcience accuſed of ſinne had preſſed downe. This, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
this, we acknowledge to be an vneſtimable benefit, and a
great fauour, that God ſheweth to vs vile wretches, that that
mercy which he hath ſealed vp for vs in heauen, he hath cauſed
to be made known here on earth, by the miniſtery of the goſpel.
And this is all the power that is giuen to man, to proclaime vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs that pardon,<note place="margin">Eſa. 1. 18.</note> that God only giueth. To tell vs, that if our
ſinnes were as crimſon, they (being for Chriſt his ſake pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned)
ſhal be as white as ſnow, and if they were like ſcarlet, they
ſhalbe as wooll. But either to thinke or ſay, that any man can
giue any pardon, is too abſurd. I cannot therefore but maruel at
the church of Rome, and the biſhops thereof, tha they ſhame
not, as it were to thruſt themſelues into Gods place, and to take
vpon them to doe, that, which none can doe but God only. They

like manner to ſuch as deuoutly ſay ſo many praiers before ſuch
an image, or goe in pilgrimage to ſuch a place. They ſend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
into all places, their pardons and indulgences, making of
them plaine marchandies. So that men or women, may for a
litle mony, buie a pardon for their greateſt ſinnes, as they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agine.
Is not this an eaſie way for rich men to get to heauen?<note place="margin">Popery a doctrine of licentioſneſſe.</note>
Is not this the very fountaine of all licentious liuing, to teach
that men for mony, may make their peace with God, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfie

harlot, dare charge our doctrine of iuſtification by fayth
(taught firſt by Chriſt himſelfe,<note place="margin">Ioh. 3. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

eſpecially Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in plaine words) to be a doctrine of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
What ſhall we then ſay of this wicked doctine, or rather
of this blaſphemous marchandies, whereby leaue to ſinne, is
ſold as commonly for mony, as old boots and ſhoes are ſold in
London ſtreets, for beeſoms or broome? The firſt I ſuppoſe
that opened this ſhop of theſe popiſh wares was <hi>Boniface</hi> the
eight,<note place="margin">Plat. in Bonif. 8.</note> who gaue full pardon of all ſinnes, marke not of ſome
ſinnes, but of all, to them that viſited the place, where the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
were. And after the world was filled with ſuch traſh,
pardons were promiſed to them that would fight againſt the
Turke, yea pardons for them that would fight againſt the popes
enemies. But my meaning is not to ſtand vpon theſe points in
particular, but rather to point vnto them. Yet I can not omit
how that <hi>Clement</hi> the ſixth pope of that name, did perſwade
himſelfe ſo well of his power and authoritie in this behalfe,<note place="margin">Sleid. li. 21.</note> that
he gaue commaundement and charge vnto the Angels, that if
any died comming to Rome to the Iubilie, which he had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed

appointed it to be kept but euery hundred yeare,<note place="margin">Plat. in Clem. 6</note> the Angels I
ſay, ſhould carry the ſoules of ſuch ſtraight way to heauen.
What durſt not theſe men preſume to doe, that durſt like Gods
take vpon them, to commaund euen the Angels, to be at their
becke? Well, againſt theſe their blaſphemies which haue no
warrant no colour in the word, I only aſke of them, who can for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue
ſinne but God onely?<note place="margin">Marke 2. 7. 1. Pet. 1. 18, 19.</note> Let them proue it by ſcripture, let

            <p>An other great abuſe there is in this there wicked doctrine.
They promiſe their indulgesnce generall to al that die in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence<note place="margin">Another abuſe. The generall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of pardon.</note>
of chriſtians againſt the Turke. Yea they often ſell their

reportes,<note place="margin">Act. Rom. pontif. Mart. 5.</note> that ſome did in Saxonie, in the time of pope <hi>Martine</hi>
the firſt. What excuſe can they make, or what pretence can
they vſe, to make this haue any ſhew of lawfulneſſe? God in the

alleaged, to proue that any man or woman receaue forgiueneſſe
of ſins, vnleſſe they firſt be ſorie for the ſame, which commonly
cannot be in ſodaine death in the wars, and the pardoners rather
require money then amending for the ſame.<note place="margin">Luke 7. Luke 19. 8.</note> The ſinful woman

               <hi>Peters</hi> denying of Chriſt was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen
him, but by weeping hee teſtified his ſorow for the ſame.
The like may be ſaid of many other, whome I for ſhortneſſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.</p>
            <p>Wickedly therefore doeth the Pope giue his pardon of
ſinnes, not ſeeing ſorrow for ſinnes, or purpoſe of amendment
in them, that buy or inioy thoſe their pardons. So <hi>Alexander</hi>
the fifth did wickedly abuſe the words of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Plaeina.</note> being at point
of death: my peace I giue to you, my peace I leaue with you,
as though he could giue that peace.</p>
            <p>But if he haue beeue ſo ſawcie with God, how ſhall he behaue
himſelfe thinke you towards men? For that is another point
which is neeeſſarie to be conſidered. Whereby it will appeare
that as by ſubtilty he entred, ſo with much pride and more then
barbarous cruelty he hath raigned. I told you before, how that
when he had firſt by the emperors means got the biſhops vnder
him, he neuer reſted vntil he had not onely thruſt the emeperour
from hauing any thing to doe in this election: but alſo brought
them vnder his yoke, that they could not be confirmed in the
empire but by him. Now what folowed of this muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.
Firſt he did ſtriue earneſtly, to keepe all that he had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:7294:85"/>
and if any emperour hauing indeede in him any noble heart,
would ſeeke to recouer his ancient libertie in ſome part, and to
free himſelfe, from that Romiſh Egypt, and ſlauiſh ſeruitude,
wherein that proud <hi>Pharo</hi> (vnmindfull of Gods graces to him,
or his duetie to others) did ſeeke to detaine him: then would the
proud pope, <hi>viis &amp; modis,</hi> by al meanes that poſſible he could
deuiſe, ſo perſecute and afflict ſuch, as if he were ſet vp of God,
to be a pledge to all chriſtian princes, and (as were the Cananits
vnto the Iſraelites) pricks in their eies,<note place="margin">Num. 33. 55.</note> and continuall thornes,
and whips in their ſides. And this may euidently appeare out of
innumerable examples. The church of Rauenna did not vpon
<hi>Phoeas</hi> his decree, ſubmit it ſelfe to the church of Rome, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
it to be her head. The patriarch thereof thought
himſelfe to vne as great at Rauenna, as the pope was at
Rome.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Theodorus</hi> although he willingly would haue kept that<note place="margin">Funct. Cronol an 686.</note>
ancient priuiledge, yet for feare ſubmited himſelfe to <hi>Donus</hi>
then biſhop of Rome, about the yeare of the Lord ſix hundred
ſeuentie and ſeuen.<note place="margin">The popes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention with his brethren.</note> But <hi>Felix</hi> beeing after patriarch of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenna,
and deſirous to ſtand in his auncient priuiledges, mouen
the people to the ſame. So that by all meanes they ſought to
ſhake off the biſhop of Rome his heauie yoke. <hi>Leo</hi> then biſhop
of Rome ſtirred vp <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> the ſecond Emperour of that
name, by ſlaughter, ſiege ſpoile, and ſuch violent meanes, to
ſubiect that patriarch to his ſeate. And <hi>Felix</hi> who ſought to
recouer his liberties, had his eies thruſt out with a hot burning
Iron, as out of <hi>Sabelicus</hi> and <hi>Nauclerus</hi> it is reported. But
the pope is not more earneſt, to maintaine his ſupremacie ouer
biſhops (although this hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

third, that the Emperours conſent ſhould not he regarded, in
electing the Biſhop of Rome, but the voices or election of the
Cleargie, and people therein ſhould be free.</p>
            <p>Now by this exemption which the Romans had from the
Emperour, that hee had nothing to doe in their elections: as
they were without feare of his diſpleaſure, ſo were they without
care of doing in their elections as they ought, and by that means
preferred many vnworthie of that place. Wherefore pope <hi>Leo</hi>
the eight,<note place="margin">Diſt. 63. in Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodo. The emperours tight reſtored.</note> in a Synod holden at Rome did decree, that <hi>Otho</hi>

And if any ſhall goe about to infringe this decree, he is excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate.
If he continue therein, he ſhall be perpetually bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
or haue extreame puniſhment. How long this decree was
kept which was nowe by two Councils at Rome, and by two

it is not certaine.<note place="margin">The Romiſh ſhif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

accounted ſimonie, for anie man to take anie biſhopricke, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice,
being inſtituted thereto by anie lay man. And this was
eſpecially laboured by <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> as ſoone as euer hee came
to haue any thing to doe for the popes, that the Emperour or
lay men, ſhould haue nothing to doe, in the election of the pope.
And becauſe alreadie two Councils had giuen to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
that authoritie, they that followed would not altogether
and directly, controll the decree of the Councils, but more
craftily they ſo handle the matter, that by a very generall decree,
forbidding all lay men to meddle with elections, or to intteſt
the cleargie, or rather threatning the cleargie, that will receiue
anie eccleſiaſticall promotion at the handes of anie lay man,
they imagine that they annihilate that, which more particularlie,
giueth to the Emperour that power. And indeed moſt buſie to
bring this about, was <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> (that firebrand of much
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:7294:87"/>
miſchiefe) who beeing pope, (for that is hee that was called
<hi>Gregorie</hi> the ſeuenth) it was almoſt the greateſt ſinne that a
pope could commit, to ſeeke to haue his election confirmed by the
Emperour.</p>
            <p>But before the time of this <hi>Gregorie</hi> the ſeuenth his papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
as <hi>Pantalcon</hi> reporteth,<note place="margin">Panta. ex blondo.</note> 
               <hi>Clement</hi> the ſecond, went alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to debarre the people of Rome, for hauing anie thing to
doe in electing the Pope. And thus the biſhoppes of Rome,
euer repining and grudging, that the emperour (whoſe power
they feared) might bee a bridle vnto them, or rather a deſerued
ſcourge for their vngodly life, or any other lay man, ſhould haue
anie thing to do in their election, at the length did bring to paſſe,
that neither cleargie nor people,<note place="margin">Election by Cardinals.</note> nor emperour ſhould chuſe the
pope: but onely ſuch of the cleargie as were called Cardinals.
And the firſt that euer was choſen pope by the Cardinals, was
<hi>Gelaſius</hi> the ſecond. For we reade not of anie ſo elected before
him. <hi>Paſchalis</hi> the ſecond (who was next after him) was,<note place="margin">Plat in Paſch. 2.</note> as
<hi>Platina</hi> writeth of him, deſpiſed of the people, choſen of the
cleargie,<note place="margin">Plat. in Gelaſ. 2.</note> praiſed of the Cardinals. But of this he ſaith, that hee
was choſen by generall conſent of the Cardinals, and ſo doeth
<hi>Rioche</hi> a frier, an hiſtoriographer of our time. Well nowe
the biſhop of Rome hath ſhaken off his yoke, he is now lawleſſe
and peerleſſe, he plaieth now the part of an vntaught and vnru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
iade, that hauing caſt his rider, ſtriketh at him with his heeles.
For, freeing himſelfe from the emperours gouernment, he goeth
about to bring the emperour to be in ſeruitude vnder him. And
therefore firſt,<note place="margin">The emperour confirmed by the Pope. Plat. in Innoc. 3.</note> he goeth about to confirme the emperours elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as it were not ſufficient without his approbation, as <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent</hi>

they hoped their taking part wold be acceptable. As in this
caſe. For there was a diuiſion about chuſing the emperor, ſome
inclining to <hi>Frederick,</hi> ſome to <hi>Otho.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts Rom. pontif.</note> But afterward they came
to that boldneſſe that we reade that godleſſe wretch <hi>Iohn</hi> 22. or

next before him, as <hi>Bale</hi> out of <hi>Marius</hi> alleadgeth. For, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the electours by their election, might giue him power
to be King of the Romans, yet could he not now haue the name
of an Emperour, but by the pope. And thus wee ſee how vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a ſudden, he that but a litle before, could not be pope, but by
the approbation of the emperour, is now ſo great, as that the
emperour can not be emperour, but by his leaue. Now hauing
gotten thus high, his ambition yet had no end, his pride had no
meaſure, his rage had no bridle. For, as he had now either frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulently,
or violently, or rather both waies obtained thus much,
that he muſt confirme the emperour before he might haue that
title: ſo did he alſo take vpon him (O intollerable preſumption)

and his neſt made very high. Now what means haue they vſed
to clime vp into the ſame? For you muſt vnderſtand, that impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent

for this honor. Which if it do not appeare, in that which hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready

as the noone day. For many vngodly &amp; vnlawfull practiſe they

It ſhould not be ſo I confeſſe, but yet it is ſo: The greater is

               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:7294:88"/>
doth often complaine of ſuch prophets, as would runne, when
they were not ſent,<note place="margin">Ier. 14. 13. Ier. 23. 21. Ier. 29. 8.</note> and would prophecie, although the Lorde
ſpake not to them. And therefore that which they ſaid vnto the
people, was but lies, a falſe viſion, and the deceitfulnes of their
owne heart. But the true prophets neuer came but when God
ſent them. And therefore they doe commonly publiſh and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime
their commiſſion in theſe words, The word of the Lord
came to me, which is more common in the ſermons of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
then that I neede to point vnto the particular places.
Our Sauiour Chriſt,<note place="margin">Ioh. 6. 38. Ioh. 1. 19</note> when hee came, was ſent of the Father.
And for that cauſe, the Iewes ſent prieſts and Leuites to <hi>Iohn</hi>
the Baptiſt, to know what he was, what calling hee had in the
church, and by what authoritie he did that which he did. And
as Chriſt himſelfe was ſent of the Father, ſo he ſendeth his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
As my Father ſent me,<note place="margin">Ioh. 20. 21.</note> ſo ſend I you. As for <hi>Paule</hi>
who was then a perſecuter, when the other Apoſtles were ſent
to preach, yet when Chriſt purpoſed to haue his ſeruice in the
miniſtery, he called him, and that not ſtrangely onely, ſaying to
him from heauen,<note place="margin">Act. 9. 4. 1. Cor. 15. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Saul, Saul,</hi> why perſecuteſt thou me? but effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
alſo, inſomuch as he afterwards laboured more aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
than they all. Whereby it is plaine, that God would
neuer haue the miniſtery of any in his church, but that he called
them lawfully thereunto. Neither is it enough for a man to
knowe that his calling is good, I meane his office or function
which hee taketh in hand, vnleſſe hee haue within him the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
of his owne conſcience to aſſure him, that hee is called to
that function, not onely by the outward calling lawfully, but
alſo by the inward calling of the ſpirit effectually. And this is

               <hi>Platina</hi> reporteth, is was obiected vnto him, that he not hauing
taken order,<note place="margin">Plat. in Steph. 3.</note> was content to take vpon him to be pope, when he
anſwered that the people forced him thereto, the council ſeemed
to pitie him. But when the next day he defended himſelfe, by
the examples of <hi>Sergius</hi> who was made archbiſhop of Rauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,
and <hi>Stephan</hi> biſhop of Naples, being meere lay men, then
they were angry at him, and proceeded againſt him. Becauſe
therefore we ſee not any miſlike that they had of him, but onely
that he was not within orders: I ſee not but that he may well
enough be reckoned among them, that by violence poſſeſſed that
ſeate,<note place="margin">Bargom. faſcic. tempor.</note> and therefore not lawfully. What ſhould I ſpeake of
<hi>Eugenius</hi> the ſecond, that in a ſchiſme was made pope? Or of
<hi>Martin</hi> the ſecond, (whome <hi>Oniforus</hi> calleth <hi>Marius</hi>) who by
euil meanes came to be pope, and as <hi>Platina</hi> ſeemeth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
by mouing ſedition againſt <hi>Iohn</hi> the ninth.<note place="margin">Blat. in M. 2.</note> Whether he
were ſuſpected of the death of the ſaid <hi>Iohn</hi> or not I knowe not.<note place="margin">Abbas Vrſp.</note>
But the Abbat of vrſperg reporteth that the pope had poyſon
giuen him and alſo a blowe with a beetle or mall, whereof he
died.</p>
            <p>Nowe whether theſe be the euill meanes whereof the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories
ſpeake, by which pope <hi>Martin</hi> came to be pope I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
affirme. But many popes haue vſed as had meanes as
afterwards (God willing) ſhall appeare. Not long after pope
<hi>Chriſtopher,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Platina Bergomat. Rioche.</note> thought it was too long before he could get into
that proude ſet. For feare therefore leſt he might goe quite
without it, if he quickely got it not, he traiterouſly moued
ſedition againſt pope <hi>Leo</hi> the fifth, that made great account
of him, and tooke the ſaid <hi>Leo</hi> when he had beene pope but
fortie dayes, and ſo gote into the place, as <hi>Rioche</hi> affirmeth
by contention, and euill meanes. But nowe theſe Romiſh
rabbies I would haue to open me one riddle. <hi>Platina</hi> hauing
ſet downe this hiſtorie learneth by this experience that it
is moſt true,<note place="margin">Platina in Leo. 5.</note> that dignities are rather dignified or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
by men, then men by them. As the Cenſorſhip
(ſaith hee) of Rome at the firſt as a meane office, was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſet by, but when the chiefe men of the citie, tooke that
office vpon them, then the greateſt citizens thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
almoſt vnhappie, if in their life they inioied not that office.
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:7294:90"/>
What <hi>Platina</hi> meaneth by this I cannot tell, vnleſſe he think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the biſhop of Rome at the firſt, was not in ſuch eſtimation or
account as afterwads hee grew to. But that ſo it was I haue
before declared. For from mean beginning he is now growen to
be a captions controler of the greateſt princes. And this (as it
ſeemeth) <hi>Platina</hi> thinketh to be the reaſon, why the biſhopricke
of Rome (which was perchance in the beginning not worth
ſuing for) was afterwards by ſo great contention and fighting
ſought for. And ſo men haue dignified that ſeat, and not that
ſeat the men. And the place hath gotten authoritie by the
biſhops, not the biſhops by the place. Which in my iudgement
doth ſomewhat ouerthwart that fulneſſe of power, and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
ſpring of ſpirituall graces, which they would make vs
beleeue, floweth from that chaire and that power which they ſay
it hath from Chriſt himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Next after <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> commeth <hi>Sergius</hi> the third.<note place="margin">Rioche. faſcic. tempor.</note> He
diſplaced <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> by the helpe of <hi>Lotharuis</hi> the king and
ſate in his place and caſt him into priſon. Now how himſelfe
was made pope, <hi>Platina</hi> can tell you, who ſaith that he perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
<hi>Formoſus</hi> his faction,<note place="margin">Platina in Serg.</note> by whome he was before hindred,
from being pope (for hee thought he waited to long for ſo good
a place.) And thereupon <hi>Platina</hi> comparing the popes then,
with the firſt that were, findeth them nothing like. For in
times paſt, they refuſed that place being offered vnto them. But
now ſaith he, they ſeeke it by briberie, and ambition, and euill
meanes. They gaue themſelues to prayer, and to teach.
Theſe not regarding Gods ſeruice giue themſelues to tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
crueltie, that after they may the more freely fulfill their
luſts, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no man dare control the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Thus ſaith <hi>Platina</hi> of them.
Not long after commeth <hi>Iohn</hi> the eleuenth a worthie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
for ſuch a place. He was baſtard ſonne to pope <hi>Laudo,</hi>
howe holy his ellection was,<note place="margin">Bale ex Petro Premonſtratenſ.</note> howe canonically hee was
choſen is worth the hearing. <hi>Theodora</hi> a ſhameleſſe harlot,
that ruled all Rome, was greatly in loue with this <hi>Iohn,</hi> as
ſoone as ſhee ſaw him. And ſhee hauing for a time inioyed
his companie and liking well of the ſame, firſt made him biſhop
of Bondnia, after archbiſhop of Raue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>a, and laſtly biſhop
of Rome, and was not this thinke you a canonicall election.
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:7294:91"/>
But whether this harlot <hi>Theodore</hi> did violently place this
pope (which eſpecially belongeth to my matter in hand) or that
ſhe by fauour obtained conſent of the electours, it is not certain.
But by lawfull meanes, it is certaine he came not to it. There
was alſo another pope <hi>Iohn</hi> after him, thruſt into that rowme,
who although he be not numbred among the popes, yet becauſe
he was baſtard ſonne to pope <hi>Sergius</hi> the third, hee is woorth
ſpeaking of, in reſpect of the good ſtocke he came of. Therefore
<hi>Theodora</hi> that famous harlot, had a daughter maried to <hi>Guy</hi>
Marques of Thuſcia, her name was <hi>Marozia.</hi> Who following
the good conditions of her mother, by pope <hi>Sergius</hi> had a ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard,
whom ſhe and her huſband (hauing diſpatched pope <hi>Iohn</hi>
the eleuenth by ſtopping his mouth with a pillow) made pope,
and hee was called Iohn the twelfth. Thus did <hi>Marozia</hi> kill
her mothers paramour, that ſhee might make her huſbands
baſtard ſonne (by pope <hi>Sergius</hi>) pope in his roume. And thus
we ſee howe this ſeat, wherein they will make vs beleeue, that
none can ſit but moſt holy fathers, is become a denne for moſt
prophane and godleſſe ruffians and rakehels.</p>

youth he was ſtarke naught, and was not aſhamed openly to
keepe harlots. So youthfull he was, that in him began that

For <hi>Marozia</hi> (of whom before I ſpake) was his grandmother,<note place="margin">Act. Roman, pontif.</note>

the tenth, how canonicallie he was choſen, it may be ſeene
by the olde verſes that were made of his election, whereby it
appeareth that the diſcorde of the brethren, made him (who
was an Archdeacon before) father of fathers. For the place
(I meana the popedome) was nowe ſo much deſired, and ſo
ambitiouſlie ſought for, that the Cardinals manie times, would
for a long time bee diuided, and could not agree about the
chuſing of the holie father.</p>
            <p>As immediatelie after the death of <hi>Innocent</hi> the fourth,<note place="margin">Rioche,</note>
and alſo after the death of <hi>Clement</hi> the fourth, they diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
almoſt two full yeares at either time, before they coulde

<hi>Philip</hi> the French king, and <hi>Charles</hi> were they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>

among them, as that they could not agree of any. And before
<hi>Celeſtine</hi> the fift could be <hi>choſen pope,</hi> the cardinals diſagreed

indeed his ſimplicitie is ſaid to be ſuch, by al y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> write of him, that
themſelues could not be ignorant, that he was not likely, to be

a faction. And at the laſt by fauour of the French king,
and at his requeſt,<note place="margin">Rioche.</note> was <hi>Clement</hi> the fift. Next after Clement
the fift commeth <hi>Iohn</hi> the two and twentieth. The cardinalles
hauing beene diuided two yeeres and three moneths, when they
could not agree of any, they gaue power to him, to name him
that ſhould be pope. But he contrary to their expectation, did
name or chuſe himſelfe, and ſo was made pope. How canonical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he was choſen let the Reader iudge. Becauſe others would
not,<note place="margin">Bergomates Stella.</note> he ſet himſelfe in that ſeate. And ſo did <hi>Iohn</hi> the three and
twentieth: for lying at Bononia, more like a lord then a legate,
and hauing with him a great army, he threatned the cardinals to
be euen with them, vnleſſe they choſe ſuch a one as hee liked of.
They naming ſundry, he would like of none. Then they deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him to tell them whom he would haue. Bring mee, ſaith
he, <hi>Peters</hi> cloake, and I will giue it to him that ſhall be pope.
They did ſo. He caſt it vpon his own ſhoulders and ſaid, I am
pope. I omit to ſpeake of the great ſchiſme and contention that
was for the papacie, that beganne betweene <hi>Clement</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth
and <hi>Vrban</hi> the ſixt,<note place="margin">faſcicul. tempor.</note> which continued 39. yeeres, <hi>Faſcicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus

            <p>Thus haue I briefly runne ouer many of them, whome in

to haue intruded themſelues, or elſe by contention and ſtrife to

were verie deſirous to haue a Saxon the cardinal of S. <hi>Steuen,</hi>
and alſo the ſaid <hi>Break-bread,</hi> ſeemed willing to haue the ſame,
the rather to get the people to bee fauourable to him whom he
would haue, ſeeing the Cardinals had choſen one, againſt their

made pope. Frier <hi>Rioche</hi> ſaieth, perchaunce <hi>Honorius</hi> was
not conſenting to this canuaſing to make him pope. Whether
he were or not it maketh no great matter. I looke not nowe,
what the parties are, but whether the election were lawfull, the

and therefore he could be an eye-witnes of many things.
He was a cardinall and therefore by likelihood, howſoeuer he
miſliked of the doings of the man, yet he would not vntrewly
report any thing, that might be a ſtaine to that church. But if
he had written any thing falſly, it is not to be thought, but
that ſome or other hiſtoriographer of thoſe times, would haue
proued that cardinall <hi>Benno</hi> had but ſlaundered, and would
haue written againſt him. Which maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath not
ſhewed there. And therefore that which he hath ſaid doth onely
prooue, that the emperour had his faults, and that the writers
of thoſe times, would rather lay the cauſe of <hi>Gregories</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate
pride and tyrannie vpon the wicked doings of the
emperour, then vpon the proud and vnruly affections of the
pope. Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſixth a ſea and ſincke of ſinne, and
as it were nothing but a maſſe of wickedneſſe, was belike ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſkilfull in this tricke.<note place="margin">Guic. hiſt. Ital. li. 1.</note> And yet I neuer heard that euer he
poyſoned any popes, but one onely, and that was himſelfe. He
came to be pope as other in thoſe dayes, by indirect and euill
meanes. For he bought with mony, and obtained, by promiſing
the promotions that he was poſſeſſed of vnto others their voices,
and ſo was made pope. Though he was of ſo bad diſpoſition, as
that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> king of Naples (though he were neuer ſeem to
weepe, at the death of any of his children) when he heard that he
was choſen pope, wept, and with teares ſaid to his wife, that hee
would be a great enemy not to Italy only, but eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to al chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
And thus doth <hi>Guicciardine</hi> and Italian deſcribe him that
there was in that man no ſincerity,<note place="margin">A popelike man.</note> ſhame, truth, faith, religion:
but inſaciableauarice, immoderate ambition, more then barbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
cruelty, a moſt earneſt deſire to aduaunce by any meanes his
children that were not few, &amp; ſom of them as bad as their father.
Is not this thinke you a popelike prelate? Did not the cardinals
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:7294:95"/>
that ſold their voyces, to make him pope, find out a holy father
to ſit in that chaire? And ſuch are, O ye papiſts, ſuch are too too
many of the heads of your church of Rome, of later yeares. But
to returne. For I haue a litle diſgreſſed to ſhew his canonicall
entrance, and his popelike vertues. If he entred not by poyſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
yet he did practiſe it very much. And hee had a ſonne <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentine</hi>
a baſtard as hee had many (ſixe children in all <hi>Platina</hi>
ſpeaketh of) who was firſt made cardinall by his father,<note place="margin">Guic. hiſt. Ita, l. 6</note> yet
afterwards he turned his cote, and became a duke. His father
and he minding to ſup in a garden (where the ſonne alſo purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to poyſon <hi>Adrian</hi> a cardinall, that ought the garden) this
<hi>Valentine</hi> ſent thether bottels of poyſoned wine, with charge
that none ſhould drinke thereof, before himſelfe came. But the
pope his father being drie, called for wine. And becauſe none
was brought from the popes pallice, <hi>Valentines</hi> ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, giueth
to the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>pe of that wine, thinking his maſter had forbidden that
any ſhould drinke thereof, becauſe it was ſome principall
wine. As the pope was drinking, his ſonne <hi>Valentine</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
in, his father giueth to him of the ſame wine. The father
died of the ſame. Wee may note in him Gods iuſt iudgement.
For the pope and his ſonne did vſe to poyſon many,<note place="margin">A pope a poiſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner poiſoned by his ſonne.</note> not ſo much
for reuenge, or in reſpect of their ſafetie, to diſpatch ſo their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
(although euen that is but a cowardly vilanie) but to
get their goods, although they neuer wronged them. As the
rich cardinall of Saint <hi>Angelo.</hi> Yea euen their deareſt frends,
if they were rich they would ſerue ſo, as they did the cardinals
of <hi>Capua,</hi> and <hi>Mantua.</hi> But that kind of death that they had
brought many vnto, the pope himſelfe then taſted of, and the
ſonne very hardly eſcaped, but his being ſicke at that time was a
meruelous ouerthrow of his eſtate. Yea we ſee how they that
were conſpirers together, to poyſon many, did now ſhew their
ſkill, one vpon another. The ſonne poyſoning the father, for
he ſent the poyſoned bottels.<note place="margin">The father and ſonne poiſon one another.</note> And the father poyſoning the ſon,
for he gaue him poyſon to drinke. And ſo where ſome other by
poyſoning their predeceſſours made roome for themſelues:
<hi>Alexander</hi> the ſixth, by poyſoning himſelfe made roome for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.
And if they thinke none of theſe practiſes ſure enough,
then will they fall downe and worſhip him, who when he had

ſhewed Chriſt all the kingdomes of the worlde,<note place="margin">Matth. 4. 8, 9.</note> and the glorie

               <hi>Platina</hi>
himſelfe (who is loth to ſpeake the woorſt by Popes, vnleſſe the

of <hi>Silueſter</hi> the ſecond, that he gaue himſelfe to the diuell,
vpon condition the diuell would make him Pope. Muſt it not

chuſing?</p>
            <p>Cardinall <hi>Benno</hi> writeth the like alſo of <hi>Iohn</hi> the ninteenth,<note place="margin">Ben. de geſt. Hil.</note>
who came next after <hi>Siueſter,</hi> and of <hi>Benedict</hi> the 9, who as he
ſaith, was by the diuell choked in a wood. But I of purpoſe let
paſſe many of theſe examples. For I haue beene much longer
then I had purpoſed, in theſe practiſes of the popes, to get into
this chaire. If I ſhould come to the election of popes in theſe
our times is it not as eaſie to ſee, as the ſunne at noon day, that
there is almoſt none choſen to that ſeat, but by fauour, briberie,
ſuite, or to pleaſe and pleaſure ſome princes, or in reſpect of ſome
faction? Is not this the ſpêciall care that they haue in their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections,
who is fitteſt to maintaine their owne pride, and moſt
likelie to ſerue their owne turne? Are all their popes choſen now
canonically, without reſpect of any thing, but to chuſe the fitteſt?
If the greateſt friends that the Romiſh church hath, were ſo
ſhameleſſe that they would ſay ſo, yet their owne heart within
them, would tell them that they lie. Well then, if to bee thruſt
into that place by others, or to intrude themſelues, if to get it by
fighting and brawling, by poiſoning and killing, by bitter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
and ſtrife, by craft and falſhood, by briberie and gifts, by
murthering and miſchiefe: To bee ſhort, if to climbe into it by
helpe of the diuell, and by ſuch horrible wickedneſſe, as Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
eares cannot well endure to heare, be to enter in at the doore,
and to be choſen canonically, then we will confeſſe that mame of
the popes haue entered well. But if this be to come as a theefe,
and a murtherer, then what meaneth the church of Rome, ſo to

to <hi>Simon Peter?</hi> Theſe are ſuch heads, as the church
of Rome can affoord vs. Theſe are they, that we muſt call
moſt holy fathers. Theſe, euen theſe are they that cannot erre, if
you will truſt the church of Rome. And yet in all that they doe,
there is nothing but erring, out of the right way. They are
like men, that pretending to ſhoote at a marke, turne their backe
of it, and ſhoote the cleane contrarie way. And as they
are content to vſe any meanes be it neuer ſo vnlawfull, to get
into that ſeat, ſo when they are gotten once into it, they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
lawleſſe and ſhameleſſe, as by ſome examples ſhall be
ſhewed. <hi>Honorius</hi> the third, did very ſawcely oppoſe himſelfe
againſt the emperour <hi>Fredericke</hi> the ſecond (as alſo did ſome
other of his felowes) and did excommunicate him and depriued
him of his imperiall dignitie.<note place="margin">Plat. in Honor. 3. Act. Rom. pont. in Honor. 3.</note> And <hi>Bale</hi> telleth vs that the
cauſe why the pope delt ſo hardly with him, was for that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
his owne right in Apulia and Cicily. And out of <hi>Marius</hi>
he reporteth, that the pope did maintaine and cheriſh, certaine of
the emperours rebels and ſeditious ſubiects ſo that the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
could not puniſh them as they deſerued. The names of
thoſe traiters were <hi>Mathew</hi> and <hi>Thomas,</hi> who kept from him
forceably ſome of his caſtels and poſſeſſions,<note place="margin">Abbas Vrſperg. in freder. 2.</note> whom when the
emperour had ſubdued they fled to the pope: who intertained
thoſe traiters againſt their lord and maſter. Whereof becauſe
(as he had great cauſe) hee complained it ſeemeth that hereupon
he did excommunicate him. But <hi>Gregorie</hi> the ninth that came
next after him, was far more cruel then he againſt the emperour,
continuing the ſentence of excommunication againſt him, which
<hi>Honorius</hi> had pronounced,<note place="margin">Plat. in Greg. 9</note> vpon pretence that al his commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement,
hee did not goe to the holy land. Neither could any
reaſonable excuſe ſerue to mitigate the mad moode of that <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciferian</hi>
pope againſt the emperour. For by the emperours
letters, the contents whereof are to be ſeene in <hi>Abbas Vrſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſis,</hi>
and in <hi>Mathew</hi> of Paris, it appeareth that the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
was ſick, in ſomuch as hauing vndertaken the iorney, by
reaſon of his ſickneſſe, hee was forced to returne againe. But it
is plaine enough to them that marke the ſequel, that the pope
did but picke a quarrel againſt the emperour, that he might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uade
his poſſeſſions. The emperour ſeeing this ſaucie pope,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:7294:96"/>
ſo cruely and couetouſly bent againſt him, conſulted with ſome
of the Romans (with ſuch I ſay as were of principall account a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them) how he might bind the people of Rome, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
themſelues to be his ſubiects, which he brought to
pas. Then the pope ſent forth againſt the emperor, another thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dercracke
of excommunication. For which his inſolent fact, the
pope by the people was forced to flee out of Rome. And durſt
not returne in two yeares. Now the emperour to pleaſe the
pope went to the holy land as they call it. But the pope doth
now ſhew himſelfe to haue had no other meaning, in ſending
him to fight for the holy land,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> then <hi>Dauid</hi> had, when hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
<hi>Ioab</hi> to place <hi>Vriah</hi> in the ſtrength of the enemies
battel, and that he and his people ſhould flee, leauing <hi>Vriah</hi> to
be ſlaine of the enemie. So the pope commaunded the emperour
(the ſawcie ſeruant his lord &amp; maſter) to fight againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Turke.
But to what end? Had he any true zeale againſt Gods enemies?
Had he a ſincere heart, and vnfained affection, to increaſe the
kingdome of Chriſt, no no. It ſeemeth he much more deſired
the deſtruction of the emperour and intruding himſelfe into his
dominions, then the recouering of the holy land. For the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
being at Acon, hauing paſſed according to the popes plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
into that land to fight againſt the Turke: the pope by all
meanes poſſible did ſtay his ſoldiers, and ſuch as were to paſſe
ouer to aide the emperour, and fight in that quarrel, not ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
them to goe. And nowe the emperour being where the
pope would haue him, he (the pope I meane) beſtoweth huge
maſſes of mony, in hiring of ſoldiers to inuade the emperours
dominion, ſtirring vp the traitours before mentioned <hi>Mathew</hi>
and <hi>Thomas</hi> againſt him, and ſo ſubdueth to himſelfe that
which belonged to the emperour. What a godles and ſhameles
parte was this, by excommunications to force the emperour,
vnder pretence of holy warre, to leaue his dominions, and then
moſt wrongfully to inuade the ſame? And when the emperour
being there, had made an honorable peace betweene the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
and the Soldan, hauing gotten reſtitution of certain things,
that the Soldan had woon, he of his good nature wrote vnto the
pope, to certifie him of theſe newes, which he thought, would
haue bin ioyfull to al chriſtians. But that proud prieſt, as he had
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:7294:97"/>
before contemptuouſly refuſed to heare, or admit into his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
the emperours embaſſadours,<note place="margin">The pope a ſhameleſſe liar.</note> ſo did hee nowe reiect his
letters, and caſt them from him. he alſo cauſed it to be publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
abroad that the emperour was dead, thinking thereby the
rather to diſcourage the emperours faithfull ſubiectes, and to
make them yeelde vnto him. And to the end that this lying re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
ſhould not be croſſed,<note place="margin">A murderer. Act. Rom. pontif. in Greg. 9.</note> the pope cauſed the meſſengers that
brought the letters to be killed. Thus we ſee how Gods vicar
beyond all ſhame, and without all ſhew of reaſon doth whollie
oppoſe himſelfe againſt Gods ordinance, namely the emperor.
Theſe things are largely ſet downe by <hi>Abbas Vrſp.</hi> before na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
but eſpecially by <hi>Mathew</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> who in a letter writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

of the report of all the popes dealing with the ſaide emperour,<note place="margin">Mathew Paris. Hen. 3. fol. 676. The cauſes of the popes hatred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſit the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour fol. 673.</note>
ſheweth the principall cauſe of all this malice that the pope had
againſt him, was, becauſe he refuſed to permit the pope to ſet
downe order concerning Lumbrardy: for the pope deſired to haue
that matter compromitted to him ſimply, without any excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or reſeruation of any right to himſelfe. Which if the emperor
would haue yeelded vnto, and ſo haue loſt Lumbardy, as there
the emperour doth teſtifie, he might haue wonne the Popes fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour.
For hee promiſed him faithfully (if the faith of a Pope
be any thing worth) that hee woulde not onely doe nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, but he would alſo giue vnto him towards he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance

For the pope deſiring the death of the emperor, moued the

ſent him a liuely counterfet or picture of the emperor, wherby

and withall he ſhewed the popes letter, mouing him to deſtroy
the emperor, and therby did it appeare to all that heard thereof,
that the pope was a traitor to Gods cauſe, &amp; the emperors perſon.
But I am weary of raking in theſe chanels. And this which

not folowe their vnbridled wilfullneſſe. But their intollerable
and impotent pride, doth yet more appeare, if we conſider their
dooings nearer home. For you ſee howe after they had gotten
that authoritie which long they ſought, euen as a man that ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
at his marke, ſo did they practiſe and deuiſe what they
could, againſt the ſoueraine maieſtie vpon earth, as if all their
care were bent, to bring him lower as indeede they did, ſpoyling
him by litle and litle of his dominions, and ſo leſſening his
power, and at the laſt deſpiſing his authoritie, and wringing it
out of his hands as hath beene ſhewed. And as hee could not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide

not ſuffer any to haue any gouernment exempt from him, neere

Rome had the gouernment of the citie. For hauing brought

then did the Phariſes againſt that man, that durſt teach them,

what pope it was,<note place="margin">The pope caried on mens ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</note> that was firſt ſo proude, that he could not let
his owne legs carrie him. But it was ſet downe afterwards
for a lawe, vnto which the emperour muſt be alſo obedient if he
will not be rebellious to the decrees of the church. And it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
that the emperour himſelfe, if he be by, muſt helpe to carry

by his vngodly and wicked ordinances, doth tie princes vnto, as
though they were his very ſtaues. Why ſhould he looke that

            <p>Theſe and ſuch other corruptions and extortions of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops

lie at Burdeaur in Gaſcoigne, which then belonged to the king
of England, he and his Nobles thought that it was too neere to
England, and that corruptions would come thence into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.

            <p>But where is that paſtorall care, that theſe Biſhoppes

            <p>Let ſuch as loue the truth, and haue deſire to ſaue their

name a mother, but in truth a froward ſtepmother: or to a pope
inſatiable in couetouſneſſe, proude and ambitions, and to all

arrogancie (ſince they came to ſuch exceſſiue greatnes) was into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable,
their greedineſſe vnſatiable, ſo their miſchieuous malice
hath beene vnmeſurable. This appeareth moſt plainly, not only

heare of the cruel parts that were commited by <hi>Steuen</hi> the ſixt
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:7294:107"/>
againſt the dead body of pope <hi>Formoſus?</hi> For he was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to reuoke his acts, and diſanul his decrees, (although he

cauſed to be taken from him his popelike garment, and put vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

            <p>All ſtories almoſt with full conſent, doe declare and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
this beaſtly crueltie.<note place="margin">Stella.</note> The cauſe that hee pretended was,
that he was periured (I would haue thought a pope might not
haue made ſo foule a fault, and yet becauſe pope <hi>Steuen</hi> who
cannot erre, hath charged him with it, I muſt beleeue it.) So
there is one periured as is proued by ſubſtanciall witneſſe, and
an other accounted euen barbarous almoſt of all hiſtories. Yea
the ſtories that are moſt addicted vnto poperie and ſuperſtition,
doe much complaine of the diuiſion which this wrought in the
church, and of the crooked dealing of theſe cankered karles.
For <hi>Theodore</hi> the ſecond, that came next (but one) after this
<hi>Steuen,</hi> although he was pope but twentie dayes, yet was loth
not to make one in this ſkirmiſh, (for hee had no vertue in him
ſaith the ſtorie) he approued againſt all that <hi>Formoſus</hi> had done,
and ſo ſet himſelfe againſt <hi>Steuen</hi> his faction. Then came <hi>Iohn</hi>
the tenth, who yet tooke great parte with <hi>Formoſus.</hi> And when
many of the Romans were diſpleaſed thereat, he left Rome,
and went to Rauenna, where he called a councill, and there did
not onely reuiue as it were <hi>Formoſus</hi> his decrees, diſanulling,
yea caſting into the fire, that which <hi>Steuen</hi> had done againſt
<hi>Formoſus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">ſunct. anno 900.</note> but he alſo concluded in the council, that <hi>Steuen</hi>
iudged amis. Now you Romiſh catholiks whether may a pope
erre or not? <hi>Steuen</hi> did in a council reuoke <hi>Formoſus</hi> his acts.
Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith it was wrongfully done, ſo that by his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
both <hi>Steuen</hi> and his council, did erre in iudgement. Yea
and <hi>Iohn</hi> futher ordained, that they who tooke orders of <hi>Steuen</hi>
ſhould againe take orders.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:7294:108"/>
Not long after came <hi>Sergius</hi> the third who tooke vp the dead

if <hi>Formolus</hi> had beene aliue and commaunded the headleſſe

out of Gods booke, which onely ſhould be the ground of

that it is impoſſible that that which God in the ſcripture tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth

ſhould both be true. As for Gods worde we know it cannot lie.
And therfore we haue great cauſe to ſay, that that which is cont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarie

we alleage. Admit that it were not euidently true that we ſay.
Is it not good reaſon yet that we ſhould be heard, howe we can

that they who with tooth and naile, ſeek to maintaine their owne
pride, will ſo ſubiect themſelues to Chriſts yoke, ſo we are not
ſo mad as to thinke them to be fit iudges, to pronounce whether
the truth be on our ſide or theirs. For we knowe, that they will

            <p>Let them then permitte this queſtion that is amongſt vs to

to the pope, and his white ſonne the king of Spaine, (they
are their continuall meditations) dooth not this ſufficientlie
proue their cruell malice? So that their proude practiſes, and
cruell purpoſes (which are two of the fruits, of the ſuprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of the popes that I haue ſpoken of) are plaine enough, euen
in our dayes, we may ſee with our eyes the proofe of the ſame,
by (almoſt) dayly examples. But their greedie mindes, and
couetous affections, doe not appeare to vs ſo plainely, as vnto
our fathers, vnto whom they were an intollerable burthen, as
I haue ſhewed before. And although we nothing doubt, but the
fat morſels, which they vnderſtand their predeceſſours haue
plucked from this land, doe make the popes that haue beene in
our dayes, more eager to get ſuch like againe: yet God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
deliuered vs from the rauening pawes and iawes of that
Romiſh Lion (the Lord make vs truly thankefull, and in life
fruitfull, for this his ineſtimable mercie) we feele not the griefe
of his exactions. But this I truſt, ſufficeth to decalre, that the
power which the pope vnlawfully hath gotten, he vnreaſonably
abuſeth, making it a wicked and vngodly meane to crowe ouer
princes, to fill his coffers, and to execute his reuenges. And
now that the pope was come to that, that hee might doe euen
what he would, to ſatiſfie his proude, greedie and cruell luſts,
he thought it good for him to dwel and continue alwayes, in that
lawleſſe eſtate. And therefore did he, not onely ſtriue by all the
power and policie that he had, and with all his indeuour to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
the ſame, for the time preſent, but alſo did prouide ſome
meanes to maintaine it as hee hoped for euer. And to performe
this they haue had no ſmall helpe by priuileges,<note place="margin">Priuileges and immunities.</note> and grauntes
from princes, who at the firſt when biſhops of Rome, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
alſo, did applie themſelues in ſome meaſure to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourme
their duetie, were willing to the better incouraging
of them, to goe on forwardes in well doings, and that thoſe
worldly things, ſhould not be to them any let or hinderance in
their callings, that were a burthen vnto other, they were willing
I ſay to exempt them from ſuch ſeruices and duties, as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of other to be don vnto them. And becauſe that at the firſt
when Chriſtianity began to increaſe and grow mightie, no doubt
many that were ſecret enemies,<note place="margin">Cauſe of many of the immunities.</note> and yet durſt not (when the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:7294:111"/>
had by law eſtabliſhed the chriſtian profeſſion) accuſe any
man for their religion, would then lay other faults to their char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and obiect other crimes to bring the Goſpel into contempt,
as appeareth by <hi>Tertullian, Iuſtin</hi> the Martyr, and others that
they did, when religion was yet profeſſed in corners. Now it is
not vnlikely, but that godly princes to exempt them from ſuch
flaunders and reproches, would commit the hearing of thoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations
vnto ſuch as were of beſt credite among themſelues,
that when their enemie did ſee that their accuſations were not
like to be fauoured, vnleſſe they were ſufficiently proued, they
might be diſcouraged, from defaming them with vniuſt reports.
But howſoeuer theſe immunities were graunted vnto them at
the firſt, or on what conſideration, I wil not preciſely ſet downe.
But afterwards I am ſure they tooke them as their owne right,
and that they did alwayes belong vnto them. And therefore when
as the Emperour would haue taken vpon him to haue iudged of
ſome cauſes of cleargie men,<note place="margin">Diſt. 96. cap. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

them Lordes, intreated them with all ſubmiſſion. Yea, and <hi>Leo</hi>
the third pope of that name,<note place="margin">Plat. in Leone 3.</note> eight hundred yeares after Chriſt,
his life and conuerſation were inquired vpon, by <hi>Charles</hi> the

And the ſelfe-ſame examples alſo doe plainly declare, that
the clergie may not be accuſed onely before ciuil magiſtrats, but
puniſhed alſo by them according to the qualitie of their offence.
Neither did our ſauiour Chriſt (whoſe immunities and exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

claime) when hee was ſtanding before <hi>Pilate</hi> to be iudge, plead
that they might not meddle with him, neither yet Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
when he ſtoode before <hi>Feſtus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 25. 11.</note> who if there had beene any ſuch

Firſt becauſe thereby euil ſubiects were maruelouſly imboldned
to doe whatſoeuer the biſhop of Rome, that very baine of

vnquiet heades, and rebellious perſons, may deuiſe and practiſe

therefore, that by ſuch immunities bad men were much imbold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
either to performe the popes commaundements, or their
owne deſires: princes had the leſſe abilitie and oportunitie to
ſhake off that yoke of more than Egyptiacal bondage which the
pope laid vpon them. For, if they once indeuoured to attempt
any ſuch thing, they had within their realm (euen ſuch as ſhuld

better. Both becauſe it imboldned themſelues to doe much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe,
and alſo it drew many to be of their ſocieties. And ſo as
it was a double dammage to the ciuil eſtate. So was it a
double prop to vphold the kingdome of the pope, and therefore
dangerous moe wayes then one. Well, thus far we are nowe
come in this proofe of popiſh practiſes, that wee ſee their ſub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

ſhiftes to bring themſelues to this high eſtate. It is not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen

And laſtly their gouernment being ſo very deuiliſh
and deteſted almoſt of al, yet how and by what means they haue
maintained the ſame. That is to ſay, I haue opened their ſubtil
ſhifts, wherby they became ſo great, and ſecondly their practiſes
and proceedings in this their greatneſſe, thirdly their cunning
and compaſſes to keepe themſelues great, the meanes, which for
the moſt part they haue vſed to get into this neſt, which they
haue built ſo high and to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>My meaning is not ſo lay open their wickedneſſe of life, ſo

But that onely that belongeth to the queſtion of the
popes ſupremacie, which now I haue taken in hand to ſuruey,
and to the abuſe either in getting, or in vſing of it, that onelie
did I purpoſe to intreate of. And hereunto am I forced by
double neceſſitie. Firſt, becauſe it is one part of the popi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes.
But eſpecially to ſtoppe the mouthes of them whoſe ſight
is ſo quicke towards others, as that they can eſpie a ſmall mote
in their eie. In our church they can find no miniſterie, no ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
no ſacraments, all is wrong, they ſee nothing but faults.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:7294:114"/>
The great beame that troubleth their owne eye, they cannot ſee.
But as men ſightleſſe and ſenceleſſe, they imagine all is well
with them, all is catholike. Catholike church, catholike faith,
catholike religion, catholike doctrine. And yet, if the matter be
well examined neither their church, neither yet their faith, haue
any ſhew of catholike in them. As (I truſt) it is euident to ſee,
in this Suruey of the Popes Supremacie, that their doctrine
is not catholike, their doings are not chriſtian like. Let vs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
whether that which they teach vs concerning this point,
haue bene taught likewiſe of al the godly learned, or at the leaſt
of the moſt of them,<note place="margin">Whether the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie be catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like.</note> at all times in all places, conſtantly, and
of ſet purpoſe, not by the way (as we terme it) in handling ſome
other matter, often, and plainely. For theſe are the properties
that <hi>Viucentius Lyrinenſis</hi> an old father, requireth in that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
that is catholike and true. That <hi>Peter</hi> was otherwiſe a
foundation in the building of the church of Chriſt, then were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the Apoſtles, it is not a catholike doctrine. That Chriſt
gaue to <hi>Peter</hi> onely the keies of the kingdome of heauen, it is
not by theſe rules a catholike faith. That the feeding of Chriſts
ſheep in the whole world, or the gouernment of the whole church,
was commited to <hi>Peter</hi> onely, or eſpecially, is moſt catholike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taught: ſo that not one of all theſe points of their religion,
which are indeede the ground-worke, whereupon they raiſe this
their ſtately building of the popes ſupremacie, can be called ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
(as is before ſhewed.) But if they could prooue theſe
things to be catholike, as they will neuer be able to doe, yet haue
they not obtained their purpoſe. For, how is this conueyed to
the biſhop of Rome, if it were in <hi>Peter.</hi> It is not catholikely
beleeued, that he was biſhop of Rome: neither yet that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed
his eſtate or intereſt ouer the whole church (if any ſuch
had beene in him) to the biſhop of Rome. Or if all this could
be proued, yet remaineth one point that were able to ouerthrow
all. For it is not receiued as a catholike doctrine, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of Rome cannot erre, or that for ſinne and errour, the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uileges
which the church of Rome claimes, if they had any ſuch,
could not be forfeited, as well in them as in other churches.</p>
            <p>In all which pointes, if I haue nor ſufficiently prooued, that
the church of Rome teacheth falſe doctrine and repugnant to
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:7294:114"/>
the Scriptures (wherein I ſubmit my ſelfe to the iudgement of
the indifferent Reader:) yet (I truſt) that the aduerſaries them
ſelues muſt needes confeſſe, that theſe cannot be prooued, to be
catholike doctrines. But on the contrary a man may eaſily ſee,
if hee marke the ſtorie of times, that theſe things which are the
only pillers to vphold this popiſh kingdom, were neuer thought
vpon in the Apoſtles times, or the ages next to them, that is to
ſay, in the purer times of the primitiue church. But when here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
began to trouble the church, and men began to ſeparat them
ſelues from the vnity of faith, more boldly, and more openly then
at the firſt they did. And it pleaſed God to continue in ſome
reaſonable ſort, ſinceritie and trueth of religion in the church of
Rome:<note place="margin">Peters chaire.</note> then beganne that ſeate to be called <hi>Peters</hi> chaire (not
becauſe <hi>Peter</hi> ſate there) but becauſe that notable confeſſion
that <hi>Peter</hi> made, and the faith that he preached, was there eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed,
and ſoundly kept and maintained, (as before I haue
ſhewed out of <hi>Opta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>us</hi> and others) that <hi>Peters</hi> chaire ſignifieth
his doctrine. And as after the ſunne is once ſet, darkeneſſe gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
ſtill more and more, ſo that the furder from ſunne ſet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
it be readie to riſe againe, the greater is the darkneſſe: euen
ſo the farder men were from thoſe purer times, the furder did
they wander, from the wayes of truth, and the groſſer was the
ignorance that they were in. So as that which at the firſt was
not once thought vpon, yet was it at the laſt affirmed of ſome
very conſtantly and boldly. But if they cannot prooue it to be a
doctrine generally receiued at all times euen in the dayes of the
apoſtles, and ſo by continuall ſucceſſion conſtantly taught in the
ages next folowing, and ſo deliuered vs: they do but too much
abuſe the ſimple, to tel them that is catholike &amp; auncient that is
but the dreame or late deuiſe of ſome later teachers. Now I
call them whatſoeuer antiquity they ſeeme to haue, that ſwarue
any thing from that, which the auncient of daies hath taught, or
Chriſt who is our true antiquitie, hath deliuered. It behooueth
therfore al chriſtians to take heede of ſuch, as vnder pretence of
being popiſh catholicks,<note place="margin">Ignat. epiſt. ad Philadelph.</note> and vnder or colour of this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

this worde catholike faith, catholike religion, catholike church,
whereas in truth, as it ſeemeth, that they being neither thought
worthy of preferment at home, neither yet finding that they loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
for abroad, euen as the cormorants gather where the carkas
is, to get their prey: ſo theſe ſeeke their meate and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
by ſeducing ſuch ſimple and ſillie ſoules. Neither doe I
affirme, that all are moued by theſe cauſes, either to leaue their
natiue countrie, either to returne to ſowe amongſt her maieſties
ſubiects, this ſeede of ſeduction and ſedition, but they that doe
trouble this Realme, are for the moſt part ſuch, and moued by
ſuch reaſons. But as they can not proue by an catholike
grounds their title to the ſupremacie to bee good: ſo their prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
is too bad, and farre from that chriſtian modeſtie and meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
which ſhould be in Gods children. For if ſaint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid

then howe can the pope claime that ſoueraigne authoritie ouer
all kings,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2. 13.</note> and whom ſaint <hi>Peter</hi> calleth chiefe. If none can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into anie calling, eſpeciallie to haue the charge ouer the flocke
of Chriſt, vnleſſe he be called therevnto, as it is confeſſed by all
men: what reaſon can the biſhops of Rome pretend, why either
they ſhould without any warrant, nay contrarie to the worde, ſo
exalt themſelues aboue all other, or ſo vnlawfully, or rather by
ſo vile practiſes and ſhifts, as by violence and ſtrife, by buing
and ſelling, by falſhood and craft, by poiſoning and murders, by
ſorcerie and the diuels helpe, get to be popes? Or being placed
in that proude place, howe commeth it to paſſe that with ſo great
boldneſſe, without feare, without ſhame, they prophane the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie

Doe ſuch lewde dealings become Chriſts vicar, or <hi>Peters</hi>
