            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Thought good for the ſatisfaction of Friends in <hi>London,</hi> to ſignifie,
that we have bin in the County of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> full of Feares: but the
cloud (<hi>God</hi> be thanked) was ſoon blown over.</p>
            <p>The Marqueſſe <hi>Harford</hi> came on the 25. <hi>Iuly,</hi> at the Aſſiſes to <hi>Bath,</hi>
with divers others, to execute the Commiſſion of Array, where met
him divers of our County. The Iudge having received a Letter from
His Majeſty to forward the Commiſſion, and to give it in charge, but
he declined that as alſo the Commands of the Houſe, for declaring it Ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall;
ſo in his Charge he ſayled betwixt wind and water, very politiquely.</p>
            <p>On Thurſday following (having received little incouragement at <hi>Bath</hi>) the Commiſſioners
got to <hi>Wells,</hi> with the Cavaliers; in the interim at <hi>Bath,</hi> the Conſtables of ſome 21. Hundreds Petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the Iudge to Declare his opinion concerning the <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> which with ſome reluctancie,
being ſoundly put to it, he concluded to be Illegall; and according to a branch of the ſaid Petition,
he oppointed the Votes of the Houſes to be read in open Court, touching the ſaid Commiſſion.</p>
            <p>On Friday the Marqueſse ſent for the Sheriffe from his attendance on the Iudge to <hi>Wells,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
his counſell and Aſſiſtance (being ioyned in commiſſion with them) for the Array, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
the Marqueſſe this Anſwere, that he had received commands from the Parliament, not to
ioyne, but further to ſuppreſſe ſuch their Proceedings, whoſe commands hee was reſolved to obey,
and further ſent him the Conſtables petition, with the Iudges anſwer, which with the unanimous
conſent of the County, to refuſe except ſome diſcontented Spirits) will coole their further going
on therein; divers alſo of the County have petitioned him to depart out of their coaſts. And one
Maſter <hi>Stroud,</hi> a Gentleman of conſtant fidelity to King and Parliament, who in execution of the
<hi>Militia,</hi> and meeting with the Marqueſſe <hi>Hartford,</hi> in the execution of the Array, ſhewed ſuch
courage, with a few againſt his many Horſe, which the countrey people, ſeeing with admiration,
got up their ſpirits, and ſo beſtirred themſelves, that in ſhort time, they had treeble the Marqueſſe
power, whereupon he left the place: It was certaine, that if the Commiſſion had taken effect, the
King would have been ſhortly in our parts, and it was intended to be made the <hi>Aceldama,</hi> you may
Communicate this for truth.</p>
