         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <bibl>LUKE, 1. 17.</bibl>
And he ſhall goe before him in the Spirit and power of

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F ever <hi>the Hearts of the Fathers</hi> had
need to be <hi>turned to the children,</hi>
that need is now, and if ever the
<hi>Diſobedient</hi> had need to be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<hi>to the wiſedome of the juſt,</hi> that

Spirit,</hi> and where <hi>the power?</hi> where an <hi>Elias,</hi> or
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:115459:4"/>
where a <hi>Baptiſt</hi> to do the worke? For if ever thoſe
ſearching and trying times, which were ſpoken of
ſo long agoe by our Saviour in the twelfth of <hi>Luk.</hi>
and the three and fiftieth have overtaken any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they have overtaken this of ours: <hi>Five in one
houſe, and they divided, three againſt two, and two a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
three. The Father divided againſt the Sonne,
and the Sonne againſt the Father; the Mother againſt
the Daughter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 10. 36.</note> 
               <hi>and the Daughter againſt the Mother;

a mans enemies are they of his owne houſhold.</hi> And if
ever thoſe irregular and exorbitant behaviours,
which were ſpoken of ſo long agoe, by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Eſay,</hi> in the third of <hi>Eſay</hi> and the fifth, have
over-runne and forraged any people, they have
done ſo by this of ours. <hi>The people oppreſſed every
one by another, and every one by his neighbour: the
child behaving himſelfe proudly againſt the ancient,
and the baſe againſt the honourable.</hi> Theſe are our
ſorrows, but where our remedy? this our miſery,
but where our redreſſe? For the <hi>diviſions of Reuben,</hi>
there are great thoughts of heart, but who can
helpe them? for the diviſions in the Church, for divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
in the State, diviſions in families, diviſions in

them out of your two Houſes) diviſions in every

Nola</hi> in the ſtory, who when hee was commanded
by <hi>the Romane Cenſor</hi> to go &amp; call the good men of
the City to appeare before him, went to the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:115459:4"/>
Church-yard, and there called at the graves of the
dead, <hi>Oh yee good men of Nola come away, for the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Cenſor cals for your appearance:</hi> for hee knew
not where to finde a good man alive. So in theſe
diſtractions and diſtempers of this our Land, if we
would finde out a joyner of hearts and a moulder
of humours, that could peece againe the diſunited
affections, and forme againe the unfaſhioned de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanours
of men towards men, we might goe and
looke for the manſion of <hi>Elias,</hi> or go and knocke
at the grave of <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> and call them to
come to ſuch a cure as this, for they once have
wrought ſo great a cure; but who can doe it that
is now alive? Oh how happy were the caſe with
us, if <hi>the Spirit and power of Elias</hi> were as ready
to be found in your two Houſes as they were once
to be found in <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> and as they are
to be ſeene in the words of the text.</p>
            <p>But as the Arke and the Ephod at the ſacking of
<hi>Nob,</hi> they which ſhould alwayes have remained
together, were by that dolefull accident parted
aſunder, and kept at diſtance: even ſo theſe two
which God once joyned together in <hi>Elias</hi> and in
the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> and which the holy Ghoſt hath joyned
together in the words of the text, ſome evill
Counſell hath put aſunder, ſo that <hi>the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>
is with you, but <hi>the Power</hi> removed a great
way off. What our Saviour ſaith concerning of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences,
<hi>It cannot be but offences will come, but woe to
him by whom the offence commeth:</hi> ſo may wee
dolefully concerning this, It is our miſery that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115459:5"/>
this divorce is come among us, but woe to that
Counſell by whom the divorce firſt came, it had
beene good for that Counſellour had he never
beene borne.</p>
            <p>How happy are thoſe dayes which are ſpoken
of by the Pſalmiſt, when <hi>mercy and truth are met
together, and Righteouſneſſe and Peace doe kiſſe each
other?</hi> And how happily ſhould we hope to ſee
thoſe dayes, and thoſe things in this Land to meet,
if we could but ſee theſe two to meete againe that
are now ſo unhappily removed to diſtance? Well,
all that we can doe is to ſeeke to drive them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with our prayers, and as Moſes for the <hi>Vrim
and Thummim</hi> upon Levi, ſo we for theſe united
upon you to pray in publike, and to pray in private,
to pray on the Lords day, and to pray on other
dayes; and it is to be a maine petition on this ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
day of humiliation, that as the Lord hath
put <hi>the Spirit of Elias</hi> into your hearts, ſo that he
would put <hi>the Power of Elias</hi> into your hands, that
as he hath made you willing, ſo would he alſo
make you able, <hi>to turne the hearts of the Fathers to
the children, and the diſobedient to the wiſedome of
the Righteous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The words of the text are the laſt words of the
old Teſtament, there uttered by a Prophet, here
expounded by an Angell: there concluding the
Law, and here beginning the Goſpell: <hi>Behold,</hi>
ſaith Malachi, <hi>Mal. 4. 5. I will ſend you Eliah the
Prophet:</hi> And <hi>hee</hi> ſaith, the Angell, <hi>ſhall goe before
him in the Spirit and power of Elias.</hi> And <hi>hee ſhall
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115459:5"/>
turne the hearts of the Fathers to the children,</hi> ſaith
the one; And <hi>to turne the hearts of the fathers to the
children,</hi> ſaith the other. Thus ſweetly and neerely
ſhould the two Teſtaments joyne together, and
thus divinely would they kiſſe each other, but that
the wretched <hi>Apocrypha</hi> doth thruſt in betweene:<note place="margin">The Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha injurious to the two Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaments.</note>
Like the two<note n="*" place="margin">1 King. 6. 27.</note> Cherubims in the Temple Oracle,
as with their outer-wings, they touch the two ſides
of the houſe, from <hi>In the beginning,</hi> to <hi>Come Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi>
ſo with their inner, they would touch each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the end of the law with the beginning of the
Goſpell, did not this patchery of humane inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
divorce them a funder.</p>
            <p>It is a thing not a little to be admired,<note place="margin">How the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crypha came into requeſt.</note> how this
<hi>Apocrypha</hi> could ever get ſuch place in the hearts,
and in the Bibles of the Primitive times, as to
come to ſit in the very Center of them both: But
to this wonderment there may be ſome ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
given, namely becauſe that theſe bookes
came to them from among the Jewes, as well as
the old Teſtament and the new. And becauſe
that the Jewes alone, and alone ſo long, had had
the knowledge of Divinity and Religion among
them, the converted Gentiles could not but give
their writings extraordinary eſteeme. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the <hi>Talmud</hi> not being yet written, the world
was not acquainted with the vanity and ſtraine of
Jewiſh learning, thoſe inſuſpecting times did
ſwallow theſe bookes, as not taſting as yet
how unſavoury that was, nor diſtinguiſhing theſe
to be of the ſame taſt. It is therefore more to be
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115459:6"/>
admired,<note place="margin">How it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued.</note> that when the <hi>Talmud</hi> was written, and
the impious and ridiculous doctrines and fables of
the Jewiſh ſchooles laid open to the world, that
then theſe bookes which ſhew themſelves to be of
the very ſame ſtampe in many things, ſhould not
onely not be refuſed out the Bibles and out mens
good conceit, but alſo get better and further foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the ſame: but to this wonderment ſome ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
alſo may be given: namely that ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition
begun then to grow in the Church every
day more and more, and it became a Religion to
doe as their forefathers had done before, and to
retaine what they had retained, be it whatſoever
it would, and of what ungroundleſneſſe ſoever.</p>
            <p>But it is a wonder to which I could never yet
receive ſatisfaction, that in Churches that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
that have ſhaken off the yoke of ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

great import, ſhould doe as firſt ignorance, and then
ſuperſtition hath done before them: It is true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
that they have refuſed theſe bookes out of the
<hi>Canon,</hi> but they have reſerved them ſtill in the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:</hi>
as if God ſhould have caſt <hi>Adam</hi> out of the
ſtate of happineſſe, and yet have continued him in
the place of happineſſe. Not to inſiſt upon this,
which is ſome digreſſion, you know the Counſell

            <p>In the words of the text you may ſee your owne
worke and taske: and thoſe two things that you
have ſo long laboured under, and that we have ſo
long longed after, <hi>Reconciliation</hi> and <hi>Reformation.</hi>
You may behold in a part of the text, <hi>Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
in theſe words, <hi>To turne the hearts of the fathers
to the Children:</hi> and <hi>Reformation</hi> in the other, <hi>and
the diſobedient to the wiſedome of the juſt.</hi> Theſe
are the two hands of our maſter which is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
or rather the two good things in his hands,
after which we his ſervants have looked ſo long,
and doe looke this day, and cannot be taken off
till he give them to us. Theſe are the hands of
your two Houſes, or rather the two great gifts
which we wait till God put into your hands to
conveigh them towards us. Theſe are the two pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
<note place="margin">1 King. 7. 21.</note> 
               <hi>Jachin</hi> &amp; <hi>Boaz, Firmeneſſe</hi> and <hi>Strength,</hi> that we
long to ſee ſet up at the doore of that Temple that
you are in building: And theſe are the two twins
for which the <hi>Tamar</hi> of our <hi>England</hi> is in travaile
and is pained to be delivered, if there be but
ſtrength to bring them forth.</p>
            <p>Theſe two things contained in the latter part of
the text, are ſet forth and illuſtrated by two cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
in the former: Firſt, by the party and
the function of that party that muſt performe ſo
great a worke, thoſe included in theſe words, <hi>He
ſhall goe before him:</hi> Secondly, the qualifications
and indowments of that party for the function, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115459:7"/>
for the worke, that expreſſed in theſe; <hi>In the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and power of Elias.</hi> The party rare, the functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
honourable, his indowments ſingular, his
worke divine, <hi>He ſhall goe before him,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>We will take up the words according to this
Diviſion, but not according to this order: for as
in nature the agent is before the action, and as in
the text, the workeman is named before the
worke, ſo are they fit to be conſidered, and ſo
will we take them into our handling, and ſo ſhall
we take them as they lie in the text, and firſt of the
firſt, <hi>He ſhall goe before him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who are meant by the <hi>He</hi> and the <hi>him</hi> in this
part of the text the dimmeſt eye that is, will eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
judge and diſcerne, upon its owne reading,
namely <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> and <hi>our Saviour Chriſt.</hi>
Two that were in a very neere relation one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by nature, for they were kinſmen according
to the fleſh, but of a neerer and of a higher relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in regard of their function, for they were they
that began the Goſpell, or the one begun &amp; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
perfected; &amp; they were they that were the two
great Prophets of the new Teſtament, or the one
greater then a Prophet, and the other greater then
a man. I cannot omit that which is not, nor can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be omitted by any expoſitor it is ſo plaine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>him</hi> in this part: namely, that in the verſe
next before, he is called the God of <hi>Iſrael, He
ſhall turne many of the Children to the Lord their God,</hi>
and in this verſe and in this whole paſſage hee is
ſhewed to be Chriſt, of whom is ſpoken which gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115459:7"/>
a pregnant and undeniable proofe that Chriſt is
God, againſt the wicked <hi>Arius</hi> that held him for a
Creature.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Baptiſt</hi> went before our <hi>Saviour</hi> in divers parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars;
in his conception, in his birth, in his preaching,
in his death. For the miraculous conception and birth
of <hi>John,</hi> went before the more miraculous conception
and birth of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> his powerfull Preaching, before
the others more powerfull; and his renowned death,
before the others more renowned. But the words doe
not meane ſo much his going before him in time, as his
going before him in Miniſtery, nor his appearing before
him in the world, as his appearing before him to do him
ſervice, as a ſervant doth before his Maſter to provide
for his entertainement; and ſo the words following doe
explaine it, He ſhall goe before him, <hi>To make ready a
people prepared for the Lord:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 10. 1.</note> And ſo the ſeventy Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
are ſaid to be ſent before our Saviour <hi>two and two
before his face,</hi> that is, to prepare men for his receiving
againſt that he himſelfe ſhould come.</p>
            <p>All the Prophets went before our Saviour in their
Miniſtery, in their divers generations, but <hi>John</hi> in a
more ſpeciall manner above them all. They like <hi>Balaam</hi>
in the <hi>foure and twentyeth of Numbers,</hi> did behold him,
but not now, did foretell him, but not neere; but he
beheld him face to face, and he told of him ſtanding
by. And hence it is, that our Saviour cals him more
then a Prophet, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 9. nay as much or more then
any meere man that was naturally borne of a woman:
<hi>More then a Prophet,</hi> becauſe he went before Chriſt as
his forerunner; and as great as any that was ever borne,
becauſe he was the beginner of the Goſpell. The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:115459:8"/>
of <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Miniſtry of <hi>Iohn</hi> the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Goſpell.</note> and the publiſhing of the
Goſpell, like time and the motion of the heavens, began
together, and in one and the ſame inſtant. So hath
<hi>Marke</hi> conjoyned them, in the very beginning of the
Goſpell, <hi>Mark. 1. 1. The beginning of the Goſpell of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, As it is written in the Prophets, Behold, I ſend my
meſſenger before thee.</hi> So likewiſe, in the firſt of the <hi>Acts</hi>
and the two and twenty, <hi>Peter</hi> propoſing a Diſciple to
be choſen in ſtead of <hi>Judaas, Of theſe men,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>which
have companyed with us all the time that the Lord Jeſus
went in and out among us, beginning from the Baptiſme of</hi>
John: And ſo in the tenth chapter of the ſame booke
of the <hi>Acts,</hi> and the thirtie ſeventh. <hi>The word you know
which was publiſhed throughout all</hi> Judea, <hi>and began from</hi>
Galilee <hi>after the Baptiſme which John preached.</hi> And one
place for all. <hi>Mat. 11. 13. All the Prophets and the Law
Propheſied untill John,</hi> and from him began the Goſpell.
So that what ſome of the Fathers ſay concerning <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi,</hi>
That he was <hi>Limes Judeiſmi &amp; Chriſtianiſmi,</hi> we
may not unfitly ſay, concerning him, that he was the
bounds of Judaiſme and Chriſtianity, the limits from
whence the Law and the Prophets tooke their concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the Goſpell, and the kingdome of Heaven
their beginning.</p>
            <p>Now as the miniſtery of <hi>John</hi> conſiſted of two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
and conſiderable parts,<note place="margin">The Miniſtery of <hi>Iohn,</hi> of two parts.</note> 
               <hi>Preaching</hi> and <hi>Baptizing,</hi>
[like as the gift of Prophecy had conſiſted in times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
of a double ſpirit, or to ſpeake more properly, of
a double power of one and the ſame ſpirit, <hi>to foretell
things to come and to worke miracles;]</hi> ſo by both theſe
did he begin the Goſpell, and by both theſe did he goe
before our Saviour. Theſe were, as it were the two
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:115459:8"/>
hands with which he laid the foundation, and began
to build up the <hi>Fabricke</hi> of the Evangelicall Temple.
And theſe two hath <hi>Marke</hi> joyned together in his rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as <hi>John</hi> did in the exerciſe of his function, <hi>Mar. 1.
4. John did Baptize in the Wilderneſſe and preach the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme
of Repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By both theſe he began the Goſpell, and firſt by
his Baptiſme: for,</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Baptiſme uſed under the law.</note> Baptiſme was uſed in the times before and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Law, but it was to admit Proſelytes to the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of the Jewes: But the Baptiſt now commeth with
a Baptiſme to admit the Jewes to another Religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
their owne. <hi>Jacob</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 35. when he is to enter
and admit the remnant of <hi>Sichem</hi> that eſcaped the ſword
into his family and Religion, he doth it by Baptiſme.
<hi>Put away,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the ſtrange Gods that are among you, and
be cleane and change your garments,</hi> where, by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
injunction,<note place="margin">Ab. Ezr. in Gen. 35.</note> 
               <hi>Be cleane, Aben Ezra<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> well obſerveth
is meant the waſhing of their bodies in water, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
nothing elſe can ſo properly be meant,<note place="margin">Tom. 1. p. 317. Aſure blah. perek 13.</note> which
what was it elſe but a Baptizing? And ſo <hi>Rambam</hi> or
<hi>Maimonides</hi> in his Epitome of the Talmud, relateth
from thence,<note place="margin">1 King. 5. 15. 16.</note> that in the times of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi>
when Heathens came into the Jewes religion by thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
(for a hundred three and fifty thouſand of them
helped to build the Temple) they were admitted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into
by Baptiſme, or by being waſhed, and not by cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion.
Thus was Baptiſme uſed in <note n="*" place="margin">49/8 Vid. R. Sol. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>arch in Ex. 24.</note> thoſe ancient
times, and uſed to induct the Gentiles into the Church
and Religion of the Jewes: But now comes <hi>John</hi> with a
baptiſme of another <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd, namely, to enter the Jewes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
another Church and religion then their owne, and ſo
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:115459:9"/>
by his baptiſme doth he begin the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>Secondly, And ſo alſo did he by his preaching: For
whereas the law called for abſolute and exact perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance,
and cryed <hi>a curſe on him that confirmed not all the
words of the Law to doe them, Deut. 27. 26. John</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
in another tenor, like God in the ſtill voyce, and
inſtead of challenging the ſtrict performance of works,
he Preacheth the gentle doctrine of Repentance; that
whereas they could not do what the Law required, they
ſhould repent for that they had broke the law, and thus
is the rigorous and terrible tenor of the law, changed
into the ſweete and comfortable doctrine of <hi>Repentance,</hi>
and thus both by Baptizing and Preaching, doth <hi>John</hi>
begin the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>And ſo by both alſo did he <hi>goe before</hi> our Saviour:
By baptiſme to admit men into Chriſt againſt he
ſhould come, and by his Preaching to let Chriſt into
men when as he came: By his baptizing to make way for
Chriſt his comming among men, and by his Preaching
to make way for men their comming unto Chriſt: And
ſo much is intimated by the words that next and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
doe follow the text, <hi>To make ready a people pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for the Lord.</hi> This might be taken onely for an
elegancy ſuch as the Scripture uſeth, to quicken expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
by repetitions, but it hath its proper vigour and
ſignificancy, and in the two ſeverall words denoteth
the two diſtinct fruits of the miniſtery of the Baptiſt in
her two parts: His <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> to <hi>make</hi> men <hi>ready</hi> to looke
for Chriſt that was now in comming; and his <hi>Preaching,</hi>
to have them <hi>prepared</hi> for his receiving when hee came.</p>
            <p>The obſervation that we may take up from hence is
this,<note place="margin">Obſerv.</note> 
               <hi>That Chriſt when he came to ſhew himſelfe in the world
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:115459:9"/>
had need of a powerfull, and a Spirited forerunner:</hi> He was
the expectation of the Gentiles. <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 10. He was
the expectation of the <hi>Samaritans. John</hi> 4. 25. He was
the expectation of the Jewes. <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. 11. He was the
expectation of all nations. <hi>Hag.</hi> 2. 7. And yet when he
came that was ſo expected, he had need of a Harbin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to goe before him, and a ſtrong forerunner to make
his way; and all this too little too. For <hi>when he came
amongſt his owne, his owne received him not.</hi> Joh. 1. 11.</p>
            <p>The Jewes ſanſie concerning the cloud of glory, that
conducted <hi>Iſrael</hi> through the Wilderneſſe, that it did
not onely ſhew them the way, but alſo plane it, that it did
not onely lead them in the way in which they muſt goe,
but alſo fit them the way to goe upon: That it levelled
all the mountaines and ſmoothed all the rockes, that it
cleared all the buſhes, and removed all the rubs. No
leſſe preparatives were required for our Saviours com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to make way for him, in the entertainement of
men, or to make way for men to the entertaining of
him: And ſo hath the Scripture expreſt it in termes not
much different: <hi>Every valley ſhall be filled, and every
mountaine and hill ſhall be brought low; and the crooked
ſhall be made ſtreight, and the rough wayes ſhall be made
ſmooth: Eſay 40. 4. Luk.</hi> 4. 5.</p>
            <p>There were two maine things that lay betwixt the
Jewes and Chriſt at his appearing, that were moſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to keepe them aſunder, and to hinder the acceſſe of
each to other, and ſo they did. And thoſe were <hi>their
corruption in manners,</hi> and in behaviour, and <hi>their corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in doctrine,</hi> and in religion; the former like rough
wayes that muſt be ſmoothed, and the latter like crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that muſt be ſtreightned; and both being ſuch as
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:115459:10"/>
muſt be helped, or little hopes they can come to
Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Firſt. As for their corruption in manners, had we
not evidence enough thereof in the Scripture, that layes
it open, we have ſufficient in their owne writers. They
were <hi>a generation of vipers;</hi> ſo <hi>John</hi> cals them, <hi>Mat. 3.
7.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jews corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in manner.</note> They were <hi>a wicked and adulterous generation;</hi> ſo our
Saviour cals them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 4. ſeeming to allude to
the Phraſe of <hi>Hoſea,</hi> the <hi>children of fornications, Hoſ. 1.
2.</hi> They were a people ſtiffenecked and of uncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
hearts and eares: ſo <hi>Stephen</hi> cals them <hi>Act.</hi> 7. 51.
And to ſpare more, our Saviour makes them as it
were the common ſhore of all vengeance, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the ſincke of all iniquity, <hi>Mat. 23. 35. That
upon you may come all the righteous blood ſhed upon the earth
from the blood of righteous</hi> Abell, <hi>unto the blood of</hi> Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias.</p>
            <p>To theſe Characters of their manners given by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
we may adde the confeſſion of their owne Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours
in their writings. The <hi>Talmud in Sanhedrim,</hi> in
the eleventh chapter hath theſe words.<note place="margin">Talm. Sanh. pag. 97.</note> 
               <hi>R: Juda ſaith, In
the generation in which the ſon of</hi> David <hi>ſhall come, The
houſe of the Aſſembly ſhall be a ſtews, the wiſedome of the
Scribes ſhall faile, they that feare sin ſhall be deſpiſed, and
the face of that generation ſhall be like dogs.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
hits them with their owne title, <hi>Beware of dogs, beware
of the conciſion, Phil.</hi> 3. 2. and ſo doth <hi>John</hi> ſeeme alſo
to doe,<note place="margin">R. Dav. Kimek on Iſay 59.</note> 
               <hi>Without are dogs. Rev.</hi> 22. 15. Such another
teſtimony doth <hi>David Kimchi</hi> give out of the <hi>Rabbins</hi> on
<hi>Eaſy 59. 16. Rabbi Johanan ſaith,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>The Son of</hi>
David <hi>commeth not, but either in a generation all holy, as
it is written, Thy people ſhall all be righteous, and inherit
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:115459:10"/>
the Land for ever: or in a generation all wicked, as it is
written, He ſaw that there was no man, and wondred that
there was no interceſſor.</hi> Too pregnant and wofull expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
ſhewed that the latter was onely true, and their
owne behaviour at our Saviours comming, confirmeth
the gloſſe to propheſie truly, that their manners then
ſhould be moſt corrupt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, and ſo was alſo their Doctrine: and that
withall in a twofold relation. 1. In regard of the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
that they held concerning the legall rites that were
amongſt them before: and 2. in regard of the opinion
that they held concerning Chriſt, who was now in
comming.</p>
            <p>1. They were ſo glewed to the Ceremonies of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>
and ſo bewitched with the Traditions of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
that it was an impoſſibility in humane reaſon to
thaw them aſunder.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of his owne doting upon theſe, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
the affection of his whole Nation in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
<note place="margin">Iews vehement addiction to their traditions and legall rites.</note> 
               <hi>I was exceedingly zealous of the Traditions of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi>
Gal. 1. 14. <hi>Stephen in</hi> Act. 6. 14. for but ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the aboliſhing of the Cuſtomes of <hi>Moſes,</hi> muſt
loſe his life, though he ſpake but what <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelfe
had ſpoken before, and what an Angel had ſpoken after
<hi>Moſes,</hi> &amp; though his face when he was to anſwer for theſe
things, ſhone like the face of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and was like the
face of an Angel. But what need I to inſiſt upon parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars?
If you looke throughout all the <hi>Acts</hi> of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
you ſhall finde that almoſt in every place where
the Goſpel came among the Jewes, this was the maine
obſtacle that ever lay in the way to hinder the freedome
of its paſſage, the fixedneſſe of that people and Nation
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:115459:11"/>
to their Ceremonies and Traditions. Let one place
ſuffice for many, <hi>Act. 21. 28. The Jewes of</hi> Aſia <hi>laid
hands on</hi> Paul, <hi>crying out; Men of</hi> Iſrael <hi>helpe, this man
teacheth all men every where againſt the people, and the law,
and this place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The preaching of the Goſpel goeth againſt their
heart, becauſe it goeth againſt their Cuſtomes, and he
that ſpeaketh againſt that people, law, and place, is
ſure to be ſpoken againſt himſelfe, for they were ſo pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
unto the rites of thoſe three, that there muſt be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking
of their removal. And thus were they moſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
in opinion concerning the Ceremonies of the Law
which they had uſed of old.</p>
            <p>2. And ſo alſo were they concerning Chriſt when he
ſhould come. They expected him to appeare in the
world as an earthly Conqueror, like <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian</hi>
by the Prophet <hi>Eliſha;</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 King. 5. 11.</note> 
               <hi>He thought he will ſurely come out
and ſtand,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jewes miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit concerning the Meſſias.</note> 
               <hi>and call upon the name of the Lord his God, and
ſtrike his hand over the place and recover the Leper;</hi> and he
only ſent him this plaine and ſimple meſſage, <hi>Goe waſh in</hi>
Jordan <hi>and be cleane:</hi> So they by Chriſt, they conceited,
Surely he will come with great worldly pompe, and
make his way with a conquering ſword, he will deſtroy
many people even as earthly Princes doe, and ſeate his
people in <hi>Canaan</hi> againe in more proſperity and pompe
then ever:<note place="margin">Eſay 53. 2.</note> and he on the contrary, came in the forme of
a ſervant, he had no forme nor comelineſſe in the eies
of men that they could deſire him: he appeared in a
poſture of humility and lowlineſſe, riding upon an Aſſe,
and upon a Colt,<note place="margin">Zech. 9 9.</note> the Fole of an Aſſe. And how farre
were they from intertaining ſuch a Chriſt as this, when
they expected one of a quality ſo infinitely different?
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:115459:11"/>
Who could beleeve that the title over our Saviours
head upon his Croſſe, ſhould be a ſtumbling blocke un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Jewes feete? And yet was it ſo at that very time
when they fixt it there, and ſo it hath beene ever ſince,
and ſo it is at this very day, <hi>Jeſus of</hi> Nazareth <hi>King of the
Jewes.</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 7. 42.</note> They looked for the <hi>Meſsiah</hi> to come from <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem,</hi>
and they knew him but for <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth.</hi>
And they expected a pompous <hi>King of the Jewes,</hi> and
how farre was he from ſuch a King. And thus <hi>they
knew not him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 13. 27.</note> when he came from <hi>Galilee, nor the voices
of the Prophets</hi> what they meant by his Kingdome,
and thus were they very farre unlikely to receive him
when he came.</p>
            <p>Theſe three things then being thus conſidered, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
taken how farre this people of the Jewes were gone
away both in life and doctrine, what corruption they had
contracted in their manners, what doting upon their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Cuſtomes, and what miſpriſion concerning Chriſt,
it is no wonder if he that came to reforme theſe things
that were ſo farre amiſſe, had need of a ſpirited and a
powerfull forerunner, to make ſome way for him againſt
he came.</p>
            <p>And as it was at our Saviours comming in the fleſh,
ſo alſo is it at his comming in the ſpirit: Whenſoever
Chriſt is to be brought in among a corrupt and irregular
people, in the power and purity of his Word &amp; Goſpel,
great hinderances doe ever offer themſelves to ſtop the
way, and they had need of great forerunners to cleare
them thence.<note place="margin">Dan. 9 26.</note> A <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is never built ſtreet and wall,
but thoſe times are troublous: &amp; a Reformation in a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
State is never wrought but with theſe oppoſals.
The very ſame things doe make the waies rough and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:115459:12"/>
unpaſſable for Chriſts comming now, in his worke and
power, that made it then when he came in the fleſh.
Theſe three are as <hi>the net upon</hi> Miſpah <hi>and the ſnare upon</hi>
Tabor, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5. 1. as the ambuſhes that the Idolatrous
Prieſts laid upon thoſe Mountaines to catch up all the
paſſengers that ſhould go to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to worſhip the true
God, theſe catch up men that they come not at Chriſt.
Theſe are the <hi>Korah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> that are ever
ready to oppoſe the <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> that ſeeke to work
good in the Congregation; and the <hi>Jannes, Jambres</hi> and
<hi>Egyptians,</hi> that affront them in the worke of the Lord.
And hence is it no wonder, that that worke of the ſame
nature, that you have had ſo long in hand, hath gone ſo
ſlowly and ſo heavily on. For,</p>
            <p>1. How truly is the morall of that Story concerning
<hi>Anomon</hi> in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. come to paſſe in theſe dayes of
ours? Firſt, he was ſicke for love of his ſiſter <hi>Tamar,</hi> and
having uſed her at his pleaſure, he was then as ſicke for
hate. So hath it beene with us of this Land: we were
ſicke but a while agoe for a Parliament, and nothing
would cure us if we had not that, like <hi>David</hi> we longed
and longed againe for this water of <hi>Bethlehem</hi> that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
the gate, and could not reſt till we had got it, and
yet when we have obtained it, and that not without the
hazard of your lives, we now caſt it upon the ground,
and care not for it: We are now as weary of this <hi>Manna</hi>
which God hath ſent us, as we were deſirous of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it came. What ſhould be the reaſon of mens ſuch
croſſeneſſe and contrariety in their affections, as to will
and to loath, to deſire and to deteſt the ſame thing, with
the ſame earneſtneſſe, in ſo ſhort a time? Why, that in
the Prophet,<note place="margin">Jer. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>You would have healed</hi> Babel, <hi>and ſhe will not

be healed.</hi> Men are affrighted I know not how at the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor
of a Reformation, becauſe they are afraid to be
ſtripped off their carnalities and corruptions. Like a
ſimple Patient, that in an eating and corroding ſore, if
the Surgeon can abate his paine, he likes it well, but to
cut out any proud dangerous and corrupting fleſh, that
he will not endure: Juſt ſo hath it been with us. Whileſt
you eaſed us of the paines of thoſe preſſures, that did
pinch, and took off the yoke from off our neck that glad
ſo ſore, it pleas'd us well, and you had our liking; but to
be reſtrained any whit from our former &amp; beloved ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſualities,
to be ſtraitned any thing of the extravagancies
of our former wayes by the reines of a Reformation, oh
this goes to the quicke, and we cannot indure it, <hi>Durus
ſermo,</hi> a hard buſineſſe, who can abide it? Our Saviour
hath told us long agoe, that parting with an old acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
boſome ſinne is as pinching to fleſh and blouds,<note place="margin">Matth. 5. 29. 30.</note> as
to pluck out an eye and to cut off a hand, and we ſee it
true by too wofull experience, by mens unſeparable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
from their delights, they carrying them, and they
them, and will not be parted, to perdition. The Vine,
Olive,<note place="margin">Judg. 9. 9.</note> and Figtree in <hi>Jothams</hi> Parable, will not leave
their wine, fatneſſe, and ſweetneſſe, to gaine a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<hi>Herod</hi> his <hi>Herodias</hi> to ſave his ſoule, nor men of
corrupt manners, the corruption of their manners for a
bleſſed Reformation.</p>
            <p>This is the firſt adverſary that you have in your way,
that ſeeketh to croſſe the glorious work that you have
in hand. And there is a ſecond which is like to this, as a
twinne of the ſame wombe, and as bad as it, and that is
corruption in opinion concerning ancient Cuſtomes,
and a fixedneſſe to what our forefathers have uſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>

2. Cuſtome, as it is commonly ſaid, is a ſecond na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and men cannot eaſily leave that which they have
long uſed themſelves, and they will not eaſily leave that
which they have ſeene and knowne to be uſed by their
Predeceſſors. The <hi>Ephraimites</hi> in the booke of <hi>Judges,</hi>
that had beene brought up to ſay<note place="margin">Judg. 12. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Sibboleth</hi> all their life,
cannot ſay <hi>Shibboleth</hi> to ſave their life, but they periſh
two and forty thouſand. Famous and fearfull is the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of <hi>Rabodus</hi> [ſome call him by another name] who
when he was ſo farre perſwaded from his Heatheniſme
into Chriſtianity, that he had one foote in the water to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
being baptized, and there asking whither his
forefathers were gone that were not Chriſtians nor
baptized, whether to Heaven or Hell, and it being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
to Hell, he puls his foote back againe out of the
water, with words to this purpoſe, <hi>That he would goe whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his anceſtors were gone,</hi> and ſo he reſolved to be
what his Anceſtors had beene. This, the more is the
pity, is the <hi>ultima Analyſis</hi> of the Religion of too many
thouſands in this Land and time; men and women are
too commonly and generally pinned in opinion and in
practice of religious things upon the cuſtomes and uſage
of ancient times, and they are loth to be parted from
them: The woman of <hi>Sychar</hi> was zealous for the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
upon Mount <hi>Gerizim,</hi> but the beſt reaſon ſhe can
give for that her zeale, is but this, becauſe <hi>her, Fathers
worſhipped in that Mountaine,</hi> Joh. 4. 20. <hi>Laban</hi> in the
marriage of his daughter <hi>Leah,</hi> will rather follow cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
then either conſcience, or his owne promiſe and
covenant: He had agreed with <hi>Jacob</hi> for <hi>Rachel,</hi> and for
<hi>Rachel</hi> had <hi>Jacob</hi> ſerved, but when it commeth to the
point of performance he ſuborneth <hi>Leah,</hi> and deceives
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:115459:13"/>
him with her, and what is his reaſon? Why, <hi>it was not
the cuſtome of the Countrey, to give the younger before the
elder,</hi> Gen. 29. 26. How the predominancy of this hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
in the diſeaſed body of this Church doth cauſe us
to caſt up againe the wholeſome Phyſicke of a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
it is knowne too well. The confeſſion of the
Prophet may be taken up concerning us, and with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<hi>We have ſinned with our forefathers,</hi> nay we are
reſolved ſo to doe ſtill. The errours that the ignorance
and dulneſſe of former times did admit into the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of God and profeſſion of Religion, we are reſolved
to retaine becauſe they were the Cuſtomes of former
times.</p>
            <p>3. And thirdly, a maine obſtacle in the way of
Chriſts powerfull comming among a people, and in the
way of your worke that ſeekes thus to bring him, is a
corruption of opinion that men have concerning Chriſt
or Religion it ſelfe. Religion to carnall men muſt be a
little gawdy, or elſe it cannot be a pleaſing Religion: as
the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> muſt be a Lady, or ſhe is not thought
fit to be a Saint. The ſimplicity and plaineneſſe of the
Goſpel, ſpoiles its intertainment with ſenſuall minds.
And <hi>Antichriſt</hi> by putting his Religion in ſo gorgeous
clothes hath gained ſo much upon them, and ſtollen
mens hearts thorough their eyes. God did once indeed
comply with the groſſe dulneſſe of the Jewes, that he
might winne them, and becauſe they could not goe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Religion then they were led by the eyes, he gave
them ſuch a one as ſuited to them, and becauſe it was
ſo with them once, carnall men would have it ſo ſtill.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the three ſonnes of <hi>Anak</hi> with whom you
have had ſo long to wreſtle, and with whom you have
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:115459:14"/>
to combate ſtill, before you can bring our <hi>Iſrael</hi> to the
deſired <hi>Canaan.</hi> I may ſay againe, that it is no wonder that
this worke in your hands goes ſo ſlowly on, when three
ſuch Giants doe ſeeke to hinder it. You have to fight
not with fleſh and bloud, but with principalities and
powers, with the ſtrong holds of Satan in the hearts of
men. Oh that we could finde out ſome ſuch powerfull
forerunners to goe before you, as might cleare the way
for your readier paſſage! Where might we get ſo skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
a Muſtian as could calme theſe evill ſpirits that thus
diſturbe all? It is farre from my skill to adviſe you
what to doe in theſe reſpects: But to you others that ſit
by, and are ſpectators how theſe Worthies labour under
theſe oppoſals, this may ſhew what need you have to
drive on the great and weighty workes that they have
in hand with the earneſtneſſe of your prayers. Their
hands, like thoſe of <hi>Moſes,</hi> it is no wonder if they be
weary with holding up ſo long in ſo great imployments,
theſe muſt be the <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Hur</hi> that muſt ſupport
them that they fall not quite. Me thinke we may even
ſee written in the very things that they are in managing,
they are ſo weighty, what <hi>Paul</hi> inſerts to ſo many of his
Epiſtles, <hi>Brethren pray for us;</hi> And Brethren pray for
them. I will conclude all in the words of the Pſalmiſt,
<hi>Let my tongue cleave to the roofe of my mouth:</hi> nay, let
me change the number, for I know you will joyne with
me in the ſaying, Let our tongues cleave to the roofes
of our mouthes: if we forget the Parliament in our beſt
devotions. And ſo have I done with the firſt part that I
named, <hi>the Perſon and his function</hi> that muſt doe the
worke; now I come to the qualification of that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
for that worke and for his function, <hi>He ſhall goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:115459:14"/>

            <p>We meete in this part with two ſeverall parties,<note place="margin">The ſecond part.</note> 
               <hi>Elias</hi>
and <hi>John,</hi> men exceedingly renowned in their genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and exceeding great reformers in their times. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias</hi>
in the middle of the times of the Law, and <hi>John</hi> in
the beginning of the times of the Goſpel. We might

               <hi>Judah</hi> and
<hi>Joſeph:</hi> Firſt, we might take in either hand one, and
treat of them ſeverally, then might we take them both
into one hand, and in our handling they might become
one; but we will take up ſuch things concerning them
onely, as ſhall be moſt materiall to be conſidered, and
moſt ſutable to the preſent times.</p>
            <p>And firſt, we may lay this poſition, and the text will
warrant it,<note place="margin">Obſerv.</note> 
               <hi>That</hi> Elias <hi>ſhall never come to live and continue
upon earth againe.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Malachi</hi> indeed deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it in ſuch termes as if he ſhould come once againe.
<hi>Behold, I will ſend you</hi> Eliah <hi>the Prophet:</hi> And the <hi>Septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gint</hi>
have driven the naile to the head to make this ſenſe
the ſurer, for they have added, <hi>Behold, I ſend you</hi> Elias
<hi>the</hi> Tiſhbite: yet the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> in the text doth tell
us, that <hi>Elias</hi> himſelfe is not to come in his owne ſoule,
but another in his ſpirit, nor he in his owne perſon, but
it was <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> was to come in his power. And ſo
our Saviour,<note place="margin">De Elia praete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rito vid. R. Lev. Gerſh in 1 Reg. 27. De vent. vid. R. <hi>Dav.</hi> Kimeh. in Mal. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Matth. 11. 14. And if you will receive it,
this is</hi> Elias <hi>which was to come:</hi> and <hi>Matth. 17. 12. Elias,</hi>
ſaith he, <hi>is already come,</hi> which his Diſciples doe truely
underſtand of <hi>John the Baptiſt.</hi> The Jewes, as they do

they hold alſo that <hi>Elias</hi> ſhall perſonally come before

his comming: And it is no wonder that they erre that
errour miſtaking the meaning of <hi>Malachi,</hi> when ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Chriſtians doe erre the ſame error with them, though
they have an expoſition by an Angel, and by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
upon that Prophecie. <hi>Janſenius, Maldonate,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of the ſame neſt, Jeſuites and Papiſts, explaining
theſe words that we have in hand, doe reſolve, that
they are more fitly to be applied to <hi>Elias</hi> his ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
which is yet to be, then to his comming in the

upon theſe words in <hi>Gen. 1. 27. God created man in his

of man was made after the Image of God, and that
<hi>Chriſts</hi> humane ſhape was the copy for the ſhape of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
whereas <hi>Adam</hi> was not made a man after the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of Chriſt, but Chriſt was made man after the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of <hi>Adam.</hi> Even ſo is it with theſe expoſitors. They
either make <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> his going before Chriſt, a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne
of <hi>Elias</hi> his doing the like, whereas <hi>Elias</hi> in the
Prophet and in the text is a patterne of <hi>John:</hi> or elſe
they make <hi>Elias</hi> who is to come (no one can tell when)
the copy or paterne of the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> already come, which
is more then ridiculous. Nor is it ſo much to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
that theſe men of corrupt judgements and minds,
ſhould erre this ſame errour with the Jewes,<note place="margin">Vid. Cornel. à Lapide in Apoc. 11. 3. Aleazer, ibid.</note> when we
finde ſo many of the Fathers to have erred in the ſame

that deſcription in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> but no expectation of
<hi>Elias</hi> himſelfe, nor no deſcription of <hi>Enoch</hi> at all. The
two witneſſes in that place are plainely charactered and
decyphered forth by the emblems of <hi>Moſes</hi> &amp; <hi>Elias. They
have power to ſhut up Heaven that there be no raine,</hi> verſ. 6.
Here is apregnant intimation of <hi>Elias:</hi> &amp;, <hi>They have power
over the waters to turn them into bloud,</hi> there is as pregnant
a one of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Theſe two men doe meete more then
once mentioned together in the Scriptures. They are
named together in the concluſion of the Prophets, <hi>Mal.

Behold I ſend you</hi> Elias <hi>the Prophet.</hi> They appeared toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and attended our Saviour at his transfiguration,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 17. 3. They are thought on together in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of the two witneſſes, as they alſo agreed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in this, that the one was the giver of the Law at the
firſt, and the other the reſtorer of it when it was decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
the one was the great Prophet of the Jewes, the
other the great Prophet of the Gentiles,<note place="margin">A miniſtery in the ſpirit and power of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> at the Jewes conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> as ſhall be
touched anon. When therefore the Jewes and the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
ſhall be knit together into one Church upon the
fulneſſe of the one and the converſion of the other, then
ſhall God raiſe up a powerfull Miniſtery to them both
united, as in the ſpirit of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> (the time of
their preaching is alluded to the time of our Saviours,
three yeares and a halfe) and Antichriſt ſhall riſe up
againſt them,<note place="margin">Tropicall phraſes.</note> and perſecute ſome of them to the death.</p>
            <p>By the way as we goe, it is not immateriall to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
how things ſignifying and things ſignified doe
often in Scripture beare one and the ſame name: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:115459:16"/>
the thing ſignifying is called by the ſame name of
the thing ſignified. As at the making of the firſt Covenant
<hi>Exod. 24. 8. Moſes ſprinkled the bloud of the Covenant upon
all the people,</hi> Heb. 9. 19. That is, upon the <hi>twelve Pillars,</hi>
which he had ſet up to repreſent the people, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. as he
had ſet up an Altar alſo to repreſent God: For to beſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle
ſo many hundred thouſands ſeverally, it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
in ſo ſhort a time as he imployed in that worke.
And ſo in the ſecond Covenant in the bloud of Chriſt,
the Bread and Wine that repreſent his body and bloud,
are called by the very names of his body and bloud.</p>
            <p>Sometimes the thing ſignified is called by the name of
the thing ſignifying, as <hi>Hoſ. 3. 5. Afterward ſhall the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Iſrael returne, and ſeeke the Lord their God and</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid
<hi>their King,</hi> that is, <hi>Chriſt their King,</hi> which was ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
by <hi>David:</hi> And ſo in the matter that we have in
hand, the Prophet <hi>Malachi</hi> cals the Baptiſt <hi>Elias,</hi> becauſe
he was ſo neerely repreſented and typified by <hi>Elias.</hi> To
them that hold that <hi>Elias</hi> ſhall perſonally come againe
indeed, we may juſtly propoſe theſe two or three queres.
Firſt, how ſhall a glorified bodie converſe with bodies
laden with corruption and mortality? Obſerve at the
transfiguration of our Saviour, when the glorified bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> appeared to him, the Diſciples
were ſo uncapable and unfit for converſing with them,
that ſome of them ſpake they knew not what.<note place="margin">Luke 9. 33.</note> Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the diſproportion that is betweene Angels and men,
if I may ſo call it, in regard of converſe, the one ſpirits,
the other bodies, how can theſe two be familiar toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
if an Angel take not on him a viſible ſhape? There
is not ſo much diſtance indeed betwixt bodies glorified
and bodies mortall, yet is there ſo much as is ſufficient
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:115459:16"/>
to ſpoyle the converſe of each with other.</p>
            <p>Secondly, What ſhould <hi>Elias</hi> doe in his perſon
here? If <hi>to preach:</hi> our Saviour hath told us, <hi>that
if men would not hearken to</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Prophets,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 16. 12.</note> 
               <hi>they
will not be perſwaded though one roſe from the dead:</hi> And
may we not inferre? If men will not hearken to <hi>Moſes,</hi>
the Prophets, the Evangeliſts, and the Apoſtles; they
will not beleeve though <hi>Elias</hi> came from heaven,<note place="margin">Gal. 1. 8.</note> 
               <hi>To
Preach the Goſpel?</hi> If another then what was preached
by Chriſt and his Apoſtles,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 7.</note> then is he accurſed though
he be <hi>Elias.</hi> If the ſame: why, that treaſure is carried
in earthen veſſels, and not in veſſells already glorified.
<hi>To deſtroy Antichriſt?</hi> This indeed is the common opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion:
<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 2. 8. vid. Chald. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Eſay. 11. 4. in edit. Buxtorf.</note> but <hi>Paul</hi> hath told us that <hi>the Lord ſhall doe it with
the Spirit of his mouth, and the brightneſſe of his comming.</hi>
Such queſtions as theſe might be propoſed to that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that is indeed of much like nature with this, but
of farre more ſtrangeneſſe, namely that that would
bring Chriſt from heaven againe, to live perſonally on
earth a thouſand yeares. Firſt, what ſhould Chriſt that
is in heaven, bleſſed for ever, doe a thouſand yeares
upon earth that is curſed? The very firſt leſſon that
God taught <hi>Adam</hi> after he had taught him the leſſon of
Chriſt, was this, that he ſhould not expect Chriſts
kingdome upon earth, for that he curſed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 17.
Secondly, how ſtrange and improbable is it to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that Chriſt who in his humane frailty had a
kingdome, which was called and was <hi>the Kingdome of
Heaven,</hi> ſhould now in his immortall glory come and
poſſeſſe a kingdome on earth? An opinion according
to the cenſure of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> raiſed upon the miſconſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of a place in the laſt booke of the New Teſtament,

firſt father of this conceit: <hi>The ſame Author alſo,</hi> ſaith he,
<hi>ſheweth that other things came to him by unwritten tradition
which containe certaine ſtrange Parables of our Saviour and
new doctrines of his, and ſome other things ſtuffed with le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendary

dead, ſhall continue and endure upon this earth, after a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
and bodily manner, for a thouſand yeares: Which opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
I beleeve that he did entertaine, becauſe he miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
the Apoſtolicall interpretations, which were delivered
by them under hidden figures, and obſcure Parables. For he
was a man, as may be gueſſed by his writings of a very ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

               <hi>The Spirit and power of Elias</hi> is held by ſome to meane
but one and the ſame thing, <hi>his powerfull Spirit.</hi> So
indeed ſometime runneth the ſenſe of the Hebrew ſtile.
As in that anſwer of our Saviour, <hi>Joh. 14. 6. I am the
way, the truth, and the life,</hi> the ſcope of the queſtion
that occaſioned it ſeemeth to call it to ſuch a ſenſe, <hi>I
am the true and the living way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Others diſtinguiſh the meaning with the words, and
by <hi>the Spirit of Elias</hi> underſtand patience and tolerancy
of perſecution, and by <hi>the power,</hi> the prevalent and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious
virtue of his miniſtration. But we need not
to goe farre for interpretations, when either the words
are of no great difficulty, or what they be of, will eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be explained by the Scripture it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>By <hi>Elias his Spirit</hi> then are we to underſtand, not his
owne within him,<note place="margin">Joh. 10. 41.</note> but the Spirit of the Lord or of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
upon him:<note place="margin">2 King. 2. 15.</note> And ſo his ſpirit is ſaid to be upon
<hi>John,</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> his ſpirit was upon the <hi>Elders,</hi> and the
ſpirit of the ſame <hi>Elias</hi> upon <hi>Eliſha.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the <hi>power of Elias</hi> upon the Baptiſt, is not meant
the power of miracles,<note place="margin">Num. 11. 25.</note> for <hi>John</hi> wrought none, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<hi>Elias</hi> did many, but his power of preaching for the
converſion of many unto God. So that whereas the
ancient Prophets of the Law, and among them <hi>Elias,</hi>
had a double power of the Spirit upon them, <hi>To fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
things to come, and to worke miracles;</hi> ſo had <hi>John</hi> the
firſt Prophet of the Goſpell, a double power, but of
another nature and a better. He foretold not things to
come, but he explained thoſe that had him foretold;
and he wrought not miracles upon bodies, but he was
miraculouſly powerfull upon ſoules.</p>
            <p>Now, ſhould we come to compare <hi>Elias</hi> &amp; the <hi>Baptiſt</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:115459:18"/>
ther we ſhould finde them agree in many parallels: as
that they both came in very corrupt times, that they
both reſtored religion very much in that corruption,
that they were both perſecuted exceedingly for that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring,
<hi>Elias</hi> by <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Jezabell,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> by <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi>
and <hi>Herodias;</hi> and divers other agreements, upon
which not to inſiſt, becauſe they bee obvious to
every eye,<note place="margin">Obſerv.</note> this collection may we take up from the
words in hand, That <hi>Elias</hi> is a proper and pregnant
patterne for Reformers.</p>
            <p>As when <hi>Moſes</hi> was making the Sanctuary and the
appurtenances,<note place="margin">Exod. 26. 40. &amp; 26. 30. <hi>&amp;</hi> 27. 8. Heb. 8. 4. 5.</note> God often cals upon him to make all
things according to the patterne which was ſhewed him
in the mount: So in this like worke of yours which you
have in hand can you platforme out a reformation by a
better patterne then by <hi>Elias,</hi> ſince you will not doe it
but by ſome patterne from the Mount? A man that in
the text is a copy to <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> in his reforming:
And a man that in his owne time <hi>reſtored all things,</hi> as
our Saviour ſaith of him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. 11. And fitly then
may he be a patterne for theſe times of ours.</p>
            <p>He reſtored periſhing religion, &amp; the decaying law:
he reſtored forgotten Prophecy, and as the Jews hold,
forſaken Circumciſion: for of Circumciſion doe they
underſtand thoſe words of <hi>Elias</hi> himſelfe, <hi>They have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken

<hi>Sceleton</hi> of <hi>Elias,</hi> it were beyond good manners, as it is
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:115459:18"/>
beyond my skill: Let me addreſſe my ſelfe to you that

in their worke, in a word or two of application,
and that according to the two words that are before us,
<hi>the Spirit of Elias and his power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>1. By the Spirit of Elias,</hi> I told you, is underſtood
the Spirit of God that was upon him: Now as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
ſaith, <hi>x Cor. 12. 4. the Spirit was but one, but the gifts
were diverſe.</hi> For looke in the fourth of the <hi>Acts,</hi> and
the thirty firſt, it is ſaid of the Apoſtles there, that when
they had prayed the place was ſhaken and <hi>they were fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And ſo they had beene ſome
dayes before, namely on Pentecoſt day, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 4.
Now they having beene filled then, how can they be
ſaid to be filled againe? Why<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then with the gift of
tongues, and now with the gift of holy boldneſſe, for,
for that it was they prayed, ver. 29.</p>
            <p>Among the diverſe gifts then of the holy Spirit,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Elias</hi> his zeale.</note> that
<hi>Elias</hi> had, this is not the laſt nor the leaſt that made
him renowned, <hi>His extraordinary zeale for the Lord of
Hoſtes.</hi> So much expreſſeth he concerning himſelfe,
1 <hi>King.</hi> 19. 10. 14. And ſo much ſeemeth our Saviour
to aime at, in his anſwer to his two diſciples that would
have fire fetched from heaven, as <hi>Elias</hi> had done, <hi>Ye
know not,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>what manner of ſpirit ye are of,</hi> Luk. 9.
55. of a zeale beyond your warrant, and you would be
forward you know not how. The thing that you may
take notice of from hence is this, That no true reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
can be expected which is not carried on with a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of zeale. The workes of God muſt be wrought with
his Spirit, &amp; they that deſire to forward his glory, muſt
do it with a holy forwardneſſe. It is the honour of <hi>Levi,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:115459:19"/>
Deut.</hi> 33. 9. that when he was about the imployment of
the Lord, he was ſo zealous in it, that he forgot all ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill

I have not ſeene him, neither did he acknowledge his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
nor knew his owne children.</hi> And ſo our Saviour in

the worke in hand, that he would not owne them that
came to hinder it. For <hi>he anſwered, ſaying, Who is my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and who are my brethren?</hi> Marke 3. 33.</p>
            <p>2. The power of <hi>Elias</hi> in Reformation was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
much, and he did wondrous things in what he
did, but yet he left exceeding much undone, which he
could not helpe, and abundance of corruption, which
he could not remove. He tooke away <hi>Baalim,</hi> but he
could not take away the golden Calves, he deſtroyed
the Prophets of the one, but he could not deſtroy the
Prophets of the other.<note place="margin">1 King. 18. 19 40.</note> Foure hundred and fifty Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
of <hi>Baal</hi> periſhed by his meanes at <hi>Carmel,</hi> and yet
are there foure hundred falſe Prophets left that ſeduce
<hi>Ahab</hi> to goe to <hi>Ramoth.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 King. 22. 6.</note> Thus impoſſible is an utter exti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
of all corruption out of a State and Church that
is corrupt.</p>
            <p>Lay theſe two now together in the two ſcales of an
unprejudicate judgement, and they will helpe very well
to ballance and to poize a right your thoughts and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
concerning theſe Worthies that are toyling in our
worke. Some thinke they have beene too forward, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
thinke they have beene too ſlow; ſome, that they
have done too much, others that they have done too
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:115459:19"/>
little; ſome complaine of too much zeale, and ſome of
too little reformation. To the former may be anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that <hi>Elias</hi> muſt be zealous if he will reforme; to the
latter, that <hi>Elias</hi> cannot utterly purge out all corruption
though he be <hi>Elias;</hi> and to both together, that in ſtead
of murmuring againſt them, it were farre fitter to be
thankfull to God for them, for that he hath put ſo much
zeale into their hearts, and ſo much reformation already
into their hands, as that we ſee more already then we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
ever to have ſeene: The ſame Lord continue the
ſame <hi>Spirit</hi> unto them, and increaſe the <hi>Power,</hi> that their
hearts and their hands may hold up and grow ſtrong,
that we may ſee the ſalvation of the Lord exerted by
them; for the reconciling of the diſaffected, and the
reducing of the diſobedient. And ſo I paſſe to the third
part of the text, the worke of the Baptiſt, <hi>to turne the
hearts of the fathers to the children, &amp;c.</hi> The caſe was
wofull when father and ſonne had need of a reconciler
to make them friends, yet was it theirs then, and ſo is it
ours now.</p>
            <p>It was a very hard taske ſurely to <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> to
turne the hearts of the fathers to the children, or to doe
this worke, for I finde it a very hard taske and trouble
to expoſitors to finde out and to reſolve, who theſe
fathers and children were.</p>
            <p>Some by <hi>the fathers</hi> underſtand the Jewes,<note place="margin">Vid. Carthiſ.</note> and by <hi>the
children,</hi> Chriſt and his Apoſtles, as <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 19. and
that <hi>John</hi> turned the hearts of the fathers to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
when he brought the Jewes to imbrace their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;
but how can the other part be made good with
this gloſſe, that he turned the heart of Chriſt and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
to the Jewes?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:115459:20"/>
Some render it thus, <hi>He ſhall turne the heart of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to the Children</hi> by the right underſtanding of the
Scriptures, and <hi>the diſobedient to the wiſdome of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous</hi>
by the obedience of faith. An expoſition that
leaveth us as farre to ſeek who were the fathers and who
the children, as we were before.</p>
            <p>Others therefore come nearer the letter,<note place="margin">Maldon. in Lec.</note> and expound
it from the difference that was at that time in opinions
among the Jewes, the father it may be a Phariſee, and
one ſonne a Sadducee, and another an Eſſaean, and <hi>John</hi>
by bringing them all to the entertainment of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
extinguiſhed that diviſion which opinions had ſet
betweene them. It is true indeed that theſe three Sects
were among the Jewes at the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> comming,<note place="margin">Joſeph. Antiq. lib. 18. cap. 2.</note> the
three Shepheards which were to be deſtroyed in one
moneth, <hi>Zach.</hi> 11. 8. but for any ſuch diviſion in Sect
betwixt father and ſonnes, it is but a conjecture, and it
cannot be ſo certainly averred.</p>
            <p>But furtheſt off of all other gloſſes, and the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper,
is that of <hi>Janſenius</hi> and others of his feather,
which yet they hold to be the neareſt and the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
of all, and that is this. That <hi>John</hi> turned <hi>the hearts
of the children to the fathers,</hi> when he brought the Jewes
to whom he preached, or thoſe of his owne time, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
the faith and doctrine of the Patriarchs that had
beene before: and <hi>the hearts of the fathers to the children,</hi>
when by reducing them thus to that faith, he occaſioned
that thoſe holy men in <hi>Limbo</hi> did beginne to affect
them, and take them to heart, which they had not done
before. I will not ſtand to examine or convince this
expoſition, for it is not worth the labour, you your
ſelves have confuted it in thought I know as ſoone as
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:115459:20"/>
heard it.<note place="margin">Fathers and Children, Jews and Gentiles.</note> The moſt genuine and reall meaning of the
words that we have in hand I conceive to be this. That
by <hi>the Fathers</hi> are to be underſtood the Jewes, and by
<hi>the Children</hi> the Gentiles; and by <hi>Johns</hi> turning each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
heart unto others, his winning them both joyntly
and unanimouſly, to the knowledge and profeſſion of
Chriſt and of the Goſpel, and by the tie of that to the
joynt communion one with another. And I am made
confident and imboldened to entertaine this expoſition
as the very meaning of the place upon theſe reaſons.</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe the Church of the Gentiles is ſtiled by the
name of the children of the Jews, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly and conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the Prophets: as <hi>Eſay 54. 13. All thy children ſhall be
taught of the Lord,</hi> and 60. 4. <hi>Thy ſonnes ſhall come from
farre, and thy daughters ſhall be turned at thy ſight,</hi> and 62.
5. <hi>As a young man marrieth a Virgin, ſo ſhall thy ſonnes
marry thee.</hi> And in very many other places.</p>
            <p>2. Becauſe it was a ſpeciall and peculiar worke and
office of the Goſpel to unite and tie the Jew and Gentile
into one: ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Epheſ. 2. 14. Chriſt is our
peace, who hath made both one,</hi> and the Goſpel the meanes.
And then muſt it be the worke and office of the <hi>Baptiſt</hi>
who began the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>3. Experience and the Hiſtory it ſelfe confirmeth
this our expoſition; for as the Goſpel in its owne nature
and promulgation belonged to the Gentiles as well as
the Jewes,<note place="margin">John 1. 7.</note> and as <hi>John</hi> came for <hi>a witneſſe that all through
him might beleeve,</hi> the one Nation as well as the other,
ſo did he baptize and convert ſome of the one as well
as the other,<note place="margin">Ioſeph Ant. lib. 18. cap. 7.</note> Romane Souldiers, as well as Jewiſh Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees,

            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:115459:21"/>
4. This expoſition maketh <hi>John</hi> the more fully to
reſemble <hi>Elias,</hi> who was a Preacher and a Prophet to
the <hi>Gentiles</hi> as well as to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> nay the firſt Prophet of
the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> This our Saviour toucheth, <hi>Luke 4. 25.
Many widowes were in</hi> Iſrael, <hi>in the dayes of</hi> Elias, <hi>but
to none was he ſent, ſaving to one in</hi> Sarepta <hi>a City of</hi> Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don:
and the men of <hi>Nazareth</hi> though but plaine and
ruſticke ſimple men, yet did they quickly underſtand it
of preaching to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> which put them into an
anger, and our Saviour into a danger. Nor can we
thinke that the holy and zealous Prophet, reſiding in
that Heathen City two or three yeares together, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
by the text, would live there idlely and doing
nothing, but that he preached there as well as he had
done to <hi>Iſrael</hi> whileſt he was among them, for he was
every where jealous for the Lord of Hoſts. I would
this were but ſeriouſly thought on, in mens expounding
the propheſie about the two witneſſes in the <hi>Revelation,</hi>
which we touched before. For if they would but ſee <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias</hi>
there which is ſo plainely emblemed and pictured
out, and withall but conſider that <hi>Elias</hi> was the firſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> it would helpe to ſettle an interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
to that place, which now hangs exceeding looſe
in diverſity of opinions.</p>
            <p>This being then the proper and onely meaning of
the words in hand, that <hi>John</hi> by his preaching ſhould
turne <hi>the hearts of the</hi> Jewes <hi>to the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>and of the
Gentiles to the</hi> Jewes; and by his Baptiſme ſhould as it
were tie them up together; the obſervation or collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that we may take up from hence is this, <hi>That true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
is the trueſt reconciler:</hi> There is no peace-maker
like the Goſpel, but it is among them that are true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:115459:21"/>
Nor is there any breed-bate like the Goſpel neither:
And ſo ſaith our Savioar, <hi>Suppoſe you that I am come to
give peace on earth? I tell yee nay, but rather diviſion,
Luke</hi> 12. 51. which he ſpeaketh out more plainely by
another Evangeliſt: <hi>I came not to ſend peace, but a ſword,
Matth.</hi> 10. 34.<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 15.</note> But this is betweene the two ſeeds, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
whom God hath ſet enmity, and there can be no
reconciliation, the ſeed of the Woman and the ſeed of
the Serpent: but to the children of the ſame father,
God, and of the ſame mother, the Church, the Goſpel
is the ſweet meſſenger of peace, and the ſweete peace maker.</p>
            <p>A deadlier hate could not be betwixt man and man,
then was of the Jew toward the Gentile. They reputed
them as Dogs, and ſo our Saviour uſeth their common
phraſe,<note place="margin">Matth. 15. 26.</note> 
               <hi>It is not good to take the childrens bread and give it
to Dogs:</hi> they reputed them as ſwine, and accordingly
they render that verſe of the eighteenth Pſalme, <hi>the
Boare out of the Wood doth waſte it, and the wild beaſt of
field doth devoure it:</hi> they abhorred their ſociety, nay
they abhorred the very mention of their converſion,
<hi>Luke 4. 28. Act.</hi> 22. 22. And yet when true Religion
commeth in, &amp; ſeiſeth both the Jew &amp; Gentile, the hate
is forgotten,<note place="margin">Acts 11. 18.</note> the feud is gone, and the deadly enemies
are the neareſt friends. Much like as it is reported con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Cairo</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> that if the Plague rage never ſo
much over night, that they die by thouſands, yet if the
River <hi>Nilus</hi> come flowing in the next day, the mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is ceaſed, and there dieth not one: Even ſo is it with
Religion: Be there never ſo much bitterneſſe and heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burning
betwixt man and man, never ſo much conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and conteſtation betwixt neighbour and neighbour,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:115459:22"/>
if the power of Religion doe but once flow in and ſeiſe
them both, the Plague is ceaſed, the malignity gone.</p>
            <p>This is that that cries downe the partition wals of all
diviſions: this is the great tie of mens affections, yea, it
is the greateſt; this is the matrimony of ſoules, making
two men to be of one ſpirit, as the other doth a man and
a woman to be one fleſh. It is Chriſt which is the tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
cauſe of making men offended, to be reconciled in a

when Chriſt comes into him by the way, no greater

For,</p>
            <p>1. Religion is a ſpeciall and ſoveraine meanes to
calme,<note place="margin">Reaſ. 1.</note> tame, and cicurate thoſe exorbitant affections
and extravagant humours that breed diviſion and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
it.<note place="margin">Eſay 11. 6, 7.</note> The Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> deſcribing the power of the
Goſpel in the Chriſtian Church ſaith, that it ſhall bring
the Wolfe to dwell with the Lambe, the Leopard to
lie downe with the Kid, the Calfe and the young Lion
to feed together, and the Cow and the Beare to goe in
company. His alluſion is to the carriage of the beaſts in
the Arke of <hi>Noah:</hi> before they came in thither, the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was ravenous, and the Lambe his prey, the Leopard
and the Beare devouring, and the Kid and the Calfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
to come neare them: but when they were come
within the Arke, there was no ſuch thing, all bloodineſſe
and rapine was laid aſide, and the Lambe and Lion
couch together, and the Lion now as harmeleſſe as the
Lambe. So is it in the Church, and ſo is it by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Religion: thoſe humours and paſſions of men
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:115459:22"/>
which before have beene bloudy, cruell, proud, ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willed,
diſſentious, and rebellious, if once the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
operation of Religion get in among them, it quels
theſe Rebels, quenches theſe firebrands, reduces theſe
extravagants, and like the diſpoſſeſſed in the Goſpel,
makes him to ſit calmely and quietly, and in his right
mind, whom none might come within the compaſſe of
before without a danger.</p>
            <p>2. Religion doth center mens affections in the center
of unity God himſelf,<note place="margin">Reaſ. 2.</note> and thoſe things that concerne
God, that they cannot ſeparate: It is an old ſaying, <hi>Quae
conveniunt in uno tertio conveniunt inter ſe; Thoſe things
that agree in a third thing agree among themſelves:</hi> Then
how many third things are there in which true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
meete as lines in a Center, that muſt needs hold
them together and make them agree? S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath
reckoned them to our hands in the fourth to the <hi>Epheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
the fourth, fifth, and ſixth verſes. They meet in one
body, in one ſpirit, in one hope of their calling, in one
Lord, one faith, one Baptiſme, in one God and Father
of all.</p>
            <p>3. Religion maketh conſcience of living in diviſion
and giving offence;<note place="margin">Reaſ. 3.</note> It dares not offer its gift at the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
till it and the offended be reconciled. It dares not
ſuffer the Sunne to goe downe upon its wrath, nor will
eate that meate that ſhall offend a weake brother: And as
the Father in another ſenſe, accounts it as deſperate to
ſleepe in malice, as to goe to bed in a den of lions. The
uſe that we may make of this may be double, and brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thus, becauſe I know not your houres and occaſions
and I feare to offend.</p>

us look out ſuch a one as is true to God: Would we have
one that ſhall be faithfull in our little things, in our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires?
let us ſeeke out ſuch a one as is faithfull in the
great thing, in Religion. As his Counſell was, to agree

for turning <hi>the hearts of the fathers to the children,</hi> and
the reducing of <hi>the diſobedient to the wiſedome of the juſt,</hi>
it is our prayer ſtill and ſtill, as it was before, that you
may have the power of <hi>Elias,</hi> or the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> as you have
the ſpirit: and ſo I come to the laſt part of the text,
and the ſecond part of <hi>Johns</hi> worke in his Miniſtration,
<hi>To turne the diſobedient to the wiſdome of the juſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe words as they lie in our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlation
doe ſhew no great difficulties, but being examined in
the Originall, they are not ſo very eaſie. A man ſcruple
that appears in both, is this; That the Angel undertaking
to quote the Prophet ſhould ſo far now decline from his
text:<note place="margin">Difference of allegation.</note> In the former part that we have newly handled,
he followeth him punctually and <hi>verbatim, He ſhall turne
the hearts of the fathers to the children,</hi> ſo ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
and ſo the Angel; but now that he ſhould have
taken up the other part in theſe words, <hi>And the hearts of
the children to the fathers,</hi> he changeth them into this
clauſe,<note place="margin">Reaſon of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> 
               <hi>And the diſobedient to the wiſdome of the just.</hi> But
to this may be anſwered. 1. That the Angel is not ſo
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:115459:24"/>
punctuall to cite the very letter of the Prophet as to give
the ſenſe. And ſo we may obſerve it to be uſuall in the
new Teſtament, in its allegations from the old. And
that he giveth the ſame ſenſe, or a true interpretation of
the Prophet, we ſhall ſee as we goe. 2. It was not very
long after the Baptizing and Preaching of <hi>John,</hi> that
the Jews ceaſed to be a Church and Nation, nay even in
the time of him himſelfe, they ſhewed themſelves ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to the Goſpel, and to the Profeſſors of the ſame,
for the generall or greateſt part of them; therefore he
ſaith not that the hearts of the children the Gentiles,
ſhould be turned to their fathers the Jewes, which
ſhould ceaſe to be fathers and to be a people, but <hi>to the
wiſedome of the juſt.</hi> And thus in the firſt part of his
ſpeech about turning <hi>the hearts of the fathers to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi>
he intimateth the Jewes that ſhould be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
and united to the Gentiles in imbracing the Goſpel:
and in this latter, by omitting to call them <hi>Fathers,</hi> he
giveth a touch of the hoſtility and evill minde that the
others of the Jewes ſhould beare both to it, and to the
Gentiles that imbraced it. And now that we ſee the
reaſon and difference in the allegation, let us take up the
words that thus differ, every one ſingle, and one after
another as they lie in order; and would the time permit,
every word would afford us matter profitably to inſiſt
upon, but I will onely hint it as we goe along, for I feare
to offend in tranſgreſſing the time.</p>
            <p>1. As in this clauſe he refuſeth to uſe the terme of <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Diſobedient.</note> for the reaſon mentioned, ſo doth he alſo of the
correlative <hi>children,</hi> becauſe of his refuſing of that.
And yet he coucheth the ſenſe of that title under the
word <hi>diſobedient,</hi> which in its moſt proper and naturall
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:115459:24"/>
ſignification reflecteth upon untowardly children diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient
to their parents. For though there be a diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to any Superiour whatſoever, as to Kings, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates,
Maſters, and the like, yet is the obedience of
children to Parents the Originall from whence it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth
denomination, and that appeareth in that thoſe
Superiours are called <hi>Fathers.</hi> As therefore the Angel
omitting to call the Jewes <hi>Fathers,</hi> inſinuateth their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
againſt the Goſpel, ſo by terming the Gentiles
<hi>Diſobedient</hi> in ſtead of <hi>Children,</hi> he ſheweth what they
were before they imbraced it.</p>
            <p>The vulgar Latine in ſtead of <hi>Diſobedient</hi> readeth <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulous</hi>
or unbeleeving:<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient or unbeleeving.</note> which though the Greek word
doth ſometime ſignifie, as might be evidenced in divers
inſtances, yet that it doth not ſo in this place may be
collected from theſe conſiderations. Firſt, that the
ſpeech is concerning children and fathers, as is apparent
in the clauſe preceding, and betweene them <hi>diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
is a more proper terme and notion then <hi>Inoredulity.</hi>
Secondly, that he ſaith not, <hi>He ſhall turne them to the
faith,</hi> which were the moſt proper if he ſpake of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeving,
but to the <hi>wiſdom</hi> of the righteous. And third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<note place="margin">Matth. 1. 4.</note> that the preaching of the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> was more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the doctrine of repentance as his Baptiſme was <hi>the
Baptiſme of repentance,</hi> but the preaching of Chriſt was
the doctrine of faith. Therefore <hi>John</hi> ſaith onely, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
Matth.</hi> 3. 2. but our Saviour, <hi>Repent and beleeve,
Mar.</hi> 1. 15.</p>
            <p>Now from this double ſignification of the Originall
word, and indeed alſo from the proper cauſe of the
Heathens diſobedience,<note place="margin">Obſerv.</note> we might obſerve, <hi>that a chiefe
and maine cauſe of diſobedience is unbeliefe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:115459:25"/>
It is a ſaying of the Jewes in their <hi>Talmud</hi> in the

               <note place="margin">Rab. Abhuhabh in Ner. 1.</note> 
               <hi>that all thoſe ſixe hundred and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene

<hi>The juſt by his faith ſhall live:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hab. 2, 4.</note> we may ſay ſomething
the like concerning ſinnes; that thoſe hundreds and
thouſands of tranſgreſſions that are committed in the
world, and all thoſe various and numerous cauſes and
occaſions from whence they proceed, they may all in
fine be traced and reduced to this one Originall, <hi>from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe.</hi>
From whence is it that men doe violate the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of the Law? becauſe they will not beleeve the
threatnings upon the violation. And whence is it, that
men refuſe the promiſes of the Goſpel? becauſe they
will not beleeve the certainty and excellency of thoſe
promiſes.</p>
            <p>2. The word <hi>Wiſedome</hi> in this place doth ſignifie <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>

ſo may we finde the word to ſignisie in divers paſſages

            <p>Firſt, it is ſomething harſh to tranſlate the Greeke
word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, in this place to ſignifie <hi>To:</hi> for though it doe
ſometimes ſignifie ſo, as Commentaries quote certaine
other places, to juſtifie that tranſlation of it in this, yet
1. That is but rarely and but ſomewhat improperly
whereſoever it is ſo uſed; and 2. It cannot be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
that if the Angel intended that very ſenſe of <hi>To</hi> in
this place, as to ſay, <hi>To the wiſedome,</hi> but that he would
have uſed the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which he uſed immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in the other clauſe, and ſay, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as he had
ſaid, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and not have betaken himſelfe to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of the prepoſition <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, harſh, ſcrupulous, and
unuſuall. I conceive therfore that that little particle is to
be taken here, in its moſt proper, genuine and generall
ſenſe, and as it is uſed millions of times in Greeke, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
to ſignifie <hi>In:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. In the wiſdome</note> and to be interpreted <hi>in the wiſdome.</hi>
And <hi>the wiſedome of the righteous</hi> is not here to be
held the <hi>terminus ad quem,</hi> or the ultimate end to which
theſe <hi>diſobedient</hi> Gentiles were to be converted; but the
<hi>medium per quod,</hi> the meanes or way through which
they were to be converted to God. For let the two
clauſes of this ſpeech of the Angel, or the parts of the
worke of the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> be laid in <hi>Antitheſis</hi> or oppoſition
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:115459:26"/>
againſt another, as naturally indeed they lie, the one
aiming at the Jewes as the proper ſubject, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at the Gentiles, the ſubject as proper, and then will
it appeare very plainely, that two ſeverall acts were to
be performed by the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> as concerning the Jewes
and their converſion. Firſt, that he ſhould turne their
hearts or affections to God, as it is laid downe in the
verſe preceding; <hi>He ſhall turne many of the children of</hi>
Iſrael <hi>to the Lord their God.</hi> And ſecondly, that he ſhould
turne their hearts and affections alſo to the Gentiles, as
it is in this, <hi>He ſhall turne the hearts of the fathers to the
children.</hi> According therefore to this double worke of
<hi>John</hi> upon the Jewes in that part of the Angels ſpeech,
muſt the like duplicity be looked for in this that concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
the Gentiles, and to be underſtood though it be
not expreſſed. For the Angel in this part purpoſely
changeth his ſtile, and neither calleth the Gentiles <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi>
but <hi>diſobedient,</hi> becauſe they generally were ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the comming of Chriſt, nor the Jewes <hi>fathers,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they ceaſed to be ſo ſhortly after, as was touched
before, nor mentioneth he the Gentiles turning to God,
but includeth it, partly he had ſet that as the chiefeſt
bent and worke of the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> to turne men to God,
and partly he involveth it in this phraſe, <hi>in the wiſedome
of the righteous.</hi> So that this being the meaning of the
Angel, as I doubt not but it is, it may afford us this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,
<note place="margin">Obſerv.</note> 
               <hi>That there can be no true converſion unto God,
but in the true Religion, or in the wiſedome of the juſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which commeth next
unto our handling, will afford a twofold conſideration.
1. That it is not without divine reaſon, that <hi>the hearts of the
Gentiles</hi> are not ſaid to be turned to the Jewes, as on the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:115459:26"/>
contrary it was ſaid of the Jews to the Gentiles, but that
they ſhould be turned <hi>in the wiſedome of the righteous.</hi>
For the enmity and feud, deteſtation and averſeneſſe
that was betwixt Jew and Gentile, and Gentile and
Jew,<note place="margin">The cauſe of a <hi>Jews</hi> hatred of a <hi>Gentile.</hi>
               </note> proceeded not from the ſame cauſe and Originall.
The Jew abhorred the Gentile not of ignorance, but
of ſcorne and and jealouſie, partly becauſe they ſtood
upon their owne priviledge of being the people of God,
which the other were not, and partly becauſe they were
provoked with ſuſpition, that the other might be the
people of God when they ſhould not be. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when the reconciliation is to be wrought betweene
them, it is ſaid, that their hearts or affections ſhould be
<hi>turned</hi> to them, for they were pointblanke and diametri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
againſt them before. But the Gentile abhorred a
Jew out of ignorance, becauſe of his Religion, hating
him as a man ſeparate from, and contrary to all the men
in the world, accounting that to be but ſingular and
ſenſeleſſe ſuperſtition, which was indeed the divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
and wiſedome, whereby he ſequeſtred that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
for his owne from all other people on the earth. So
that a Gentile did not ſo much deteſt the perſon of a
Jew for himſelfe, as for his Religion and profeſſion,
which, ignorant as the Heathen were, they underſtood
not what it meant. Therefore when the Gentiles muſt
be brought to knit and to unite to the Jewes, it muſt be
<hi>in the wiſedome of the righteous,</hi> or in the imbracing of
that Religion, which the righteous ones among the
Jewes profeſſed, and which the Gentiles, till they knew
and underſtood what it meant, accounted but vanity,
ſingularity and folly.</p>
            <p>2. It is remarkable that the Angel doth forſake the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:115459:27"/>
proper and common word uſed to ſignifie <hi>wiſedome,</hi>
which is <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, which is of a ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſtricter and ſtranger uſe. And ſo doth the Syriack
relinquiſh <hi>Hhechmetho</hi> its ordinary word that it uſeth
for <hi>wiſdom,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 2. 4, 5, 6 Rev. 13. 16. &amp;c.</note> and fixeth upon <hi>Jedhangro</hi> a word more ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular,
and of more peculiar importance. The Originall
word then that we have in hand, doth not onely import
the wiſedome or Religion of the Jewes, but alſo the
Gentiles attaining to the knowledge, and apprehenſion
of that Religion and wiſedome with them. Not onely
the theory and practiſe of the Jewiſh Nation in their
religious profeſſion, but the Heathens reaching to the
underſtanding of thoſe myſteries in that Religion and
profeſſion, which they had accounted ſuch vanity and
ſenſelesneſſe before. So that this word conſiderately
looked into will afford us this collection:<note place="margin">Obſerv.</note> 
               <hi>That it is not
enough to imbrace the true Religion in outward profeſsion,
but we are to have underſtanding, and to be acquainted
with the doctrine and principles of that Religion.</hi> For the
Heathen to turne to the <hi>wiſedome of the righteous</hi> Jewes
in an outſide profeſſion, and an ignorant religiouſneſſe,
was a poore converſion, as good as none, a worke un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
the paines of the <hi>Baptiſt;</hi> but their true turning, and
his powerfull worke is when they are brought to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
that Religion in the knowledge and underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the myſteries of it. Ignorance was never the
mother of any devotion but of a Romiſh devotion,
which is as good or as bad as none.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, there is ſome doubtfulneſſe alſo in the
laſt word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, for it may be indifferently tranſlated
<hi>of righteous things,</hi> or <hi>of righteous men:</hi> But it is the
more undoubted that perſons and perſons are rather
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:115459:27"/>
here compared together then perſons and things: in the
former part of this work of the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> there are fathers
and children, and in this part it is moſt like that they are
anſwered with perſons againe, diſobedient children and
righteous fathers, and the meaning of the Angel to be
this, that as the Jews the fathers in the imbracing of the
Goſpel, ſhall be turned to God, &amp; reconciled to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
ſo the Gentiles the children, in the wiſdome of the
righteous, or in the imbracing and underſtanding of the
Religion profeſſed by the righteous ones that had bin &amp;
were among the Jewes, ſhould be turned to God and in
affection to the Jewes. And hereupon might we take
up this obſervation,<note place="margin">Obſerv.</note> 
               <hi>that the faith of the holy Jewes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Law, and of the holy Gentiles under the Goſpel,
was one and the ſame:</hi> They that went before Chriſt in
the one, and they that followed Chriſt in the other, did
both cry <hi>Hoſanna to the Sonne of</hi> David, did both ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
ſalvation, by the ſame Saviour and by the ſame
way.</p>
            <p>And ſo have I gone with the words as farre as I dare
be bold upon the time, your patience and occaſions: I
will but put this laſt clauſe together which I have thus
taken peece-meale, and laid aſunder, and ſo have I done.
<hi>The diſobedient to the wiſedome of the righteous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
to the knowledge of the true Religion: Me thinkes
in theſe words we may behold the condition of this
Land as it hath beene in ancient times, and as it is in
theſe of ours. We were once <hi>Loammi,</hi> no people of the
Lords, and utter aliens from his congregation: we ſate,
and that not very long agoe, in darkneſſe and in the
ſhadow of death, and it is no wonder if we might be
called <hi>Diſobedient:</hi> But God who is good to all, and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:115459:28"/>
whoſe tender mercies are over all his workes,<note place="margin">Pſal. 145. 9.</note> hath come
in unto us and ſhone upon us. He hath diſcharged us of
the name of Heathens, oh that we could diſcharge our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
of the title of <hi>Diſobedient!</hi> he hath brought us
<hi>into the wiſedome of the righteous,</hi> unto the knowledge of
the Goſpel, and of ſalvation, oh that we could drive on
through that to God! He hath made us more <hi>Iſrael</hi> then
<hi>Iſrael</hi> it ſelfe, and whereas we were once the furtheſt off
of any Nation from this <hi>wiſedome,</hi> he hath brought this
<hi>wiſedome</hi> to us, to no Nation nearer. Now what thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
doth ſo great a mercy call for, for its beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
and what prayers for its continuance? Bleſſed be
the Lord God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> which thus hath viſited his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
with his Goſpel, and redeemed them out of the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of ſuperſtition. And the bleſſing of the God of
<hi>Iſrael</hi> be ſtill upon his own gift, that it may continue and
ſtill flouriſh among us: Let not the Candle which he
himſelfe hath lighted be ever put out: Nor let the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſticke
which he himſelfe hath placed, be ever moved
out of its place: Let ſcattered Popery never cloud us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
nor ſuperſtition overwhelme us. Let Religion
and the Goſpel be in all our borders, and peace and
truth in all our times. And to theſe our prayſes, and to
theſe our prayers let all the people ſay <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Amen</hi> and <hi>Amen.</hi>
