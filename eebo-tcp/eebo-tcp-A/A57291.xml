         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Corruption of Our Stage, <hi>most

the following Sheets are humbly laid, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining,

and <hi>Property</hi> swallowed up by Prerogative, to
which <hi>wicked Design,</hi> the Stage hath not a

            <p>The Bleeding Morals of this Gallant Nation,
are past the Cure of all <hi>Quack-pretenders;</hi> It
is <hi>His Majesty</hi> and <hi>Your Honours</hi> alone, who
are capable of applying the <hi>Sovereign Remedy,</hi>
by obliging <hi>Magistrates</hi> and <hi>Ministers</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form

which the Enemies of our <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi>

            <p>The Author of this Treatise has endeavour'd

            <p>Whether the Merits of the <hi>present Stage,</hi> be
such as may deserve a more favourable Censure at
Your Hands, is Submitted (as is fit it should) to
Your Great Wisdom.</p>
            <p>In the following Treatise, there's the Opinion
of the <hi>Jewish</hi> and <hi>Christian Church,</hi> of the
Greatest of the <hi>Heathen Philosophers</hi> and
<hi>Poets,</hi> of the <hi>Heathen, Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman
State,</hi> of the first <hi>Christian Emperours,</hi> &amp;c.
and of Our <hi>English State,</hi> against the <hi>Theatre</hi>
fairly exhibited: But seeing the Defenders of
the <hi>Play-house</hi> argue <hi>the Usefulness of it to
the English Nation in general, and to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Govenment in particular,</hi> it is reasonable
the Appeal should be to Our <hi>Honourable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentatives,</hi>
and that the Arguments <hi>pro</hi> and
<hi>con</hi> should be laid before them, not doubting (if
they think fit at all to take it into Consideration)
but they will give a <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Righteous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
in the <hi>Matter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not in <hi>England</hi> alone, where the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
or Unlawfulness of the <hi>Stage,</hi> and the
Immorality and Profaneness of it, is the present
Subject of <hi>Controversie.</hi> But in <hi>France</hi>
and <hi>Italy,</hi> nay at <hi>Rome</hi> it self, where as well as
at <hi>Paris,</hi> the Stage has of late, as all the
Publick Intelligences inform us, receiv'd a Check,

tho' the <hi>Prefa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>r</hi> to the Play call'd, <hi>Beauty
in Distress,</hi> says, the French Stage is so Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
as not to fall under the Censure of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Fathers. The Honour of our Nation and
Religion would therefore seem to require, that
our <hi>Theatres</hi> should come <hi>under Examination,</hi>
as well as theirs; but the Time <hi>whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>,</hi> and the
Method <hi>how,</hi> must be left to the Wisdom of the
King and Parliament to determine.</p>
            <p>In the mean time it were to be wished that our
<hi>English Ladies</hi> and <hi>Gentlewomen,</hi> whose En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
and Presence is the most powerful
Argument (after all) for the <hi>Defence</hi> of the
<hi>Stage</hi> (and by whose absenting themselves it must
fall in Course without Law or Statute) would be
pleased to consider, <hi rend="margQuotes">That the wise <hi>Roman Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi>
approv'd the Divorce which <hi>Sempronius
Sophus</hi> gave to his Wife for no other Reason,
but that she resorted to the <hi>Cirques</hi> and <hi>Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses</hi>
without his Consent; the very <hi>sight</hi> of
which might make her an <hi>Adultress,</hi> and cause
her to defile his Bed<note n="*" place="margin">Valer. Max. l. 6. c. 3. § 12.</note>. And the Christian
Emperor <hi>Justinian</hi> made the following Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
That a Man might lawfully put away
his Wife, if she resort to <hi>Cirques,</hi> to <hi>Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses</hi>
or <hi>Stage-Plays</hi> without his Privity and

            </p>
            <p>If Our Stage then be so much Corrupted as its
<hi>Advocates</hi> themselves are forc'd to confess, its
<hi>influence upon the Morals of the Audience
must needs be dangerous,</hi> and therefore its

the <hi>Chastity</hi> of the English Ladies, as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient

our <hi>English</hi> Women, whose Beauty is every

that may preserve their <hi>Modesty</hi> too from
being so much as Questioned.</p>

            <p>WE have had lately a Curious and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Survey of the Immorality and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faness
of the Stage; but, tho' that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
hath done excellently well, there
may still be some Gleanings left for another. Mr.
<hi>Collier</hi> strikes directly at the Miscarriages of the
Stage, because they were most obvious and near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
to View; but this ought not supersede the
Endeavours of others, nor to put a stop to their
Inquiry into the Root of the Mischief.</p>
            <p>If the Foundation be sapp'd, the Superstructures
must <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

patch the Roof, or to tell us that it Rains in at
the Sky-Lights, when an Inundation comes in at
Doors and Windows.</p>
            <p>There's none can be fit to write for the Stage,
that hath not first been at School; and if we be
instructed there in Plays and Romances, its but
natural we should think our selves good Profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients,
and that we have in a great measure an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
the End of our Education, when we can
oblige the World with those of our own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure.

            <p>Let the Clergy, if they seriously design a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form

               </gap>ing them.</p>
            <p>It cannot be denied but Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> has writ
ingeniously, and has taken a great deal of pains
to hew and lop off the Branches; and consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how much the Play-house was favoured in the
Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> I. by some of the highest Dignity
in the Church, we have more reason to wonder
that he hath said so much, than that he hath said
any thing too little, because that part of the Sense
of Antiquity, which he hath repeated to us in
this Matter, does obliquely condemn that Prince
whom so many Ecclesiasticks of great Note,
have always accounted a Martyr: Besides, his
writing against Plays at present, and some of the
principal Authors of them, is not like to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
an extraordinary piece of Service to the
Courts of <hi>St. Germains</hi> and <hi>Versails.</hi> If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
that the Restoring and Incouraging of Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses,
was one of the chief Expedients of those
who were resolved to put Cardinal <hi>Mazarins</hi>
Advice in Execution, which was to debauch the
Nation, in order to the better Introducing of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            </p>
            <p>If all our Church-men had done their Duty as
well as Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> has done his, in this Matter,
Stage-Plays had never b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98165:7"/>
nor had there been the least pretence for their
Usefulness: But in K. <hi>Charles</hi> I. Time, they were
necessary to Ridicule the Puritans, and run down
the Patrons of Liberty and Property. And in
K. <hi>Char.</hi> II. Reign, they were no less wanted to lash
the Dissenters and Whiggs that oppos'd Tyranny,
and needful to promote the Glorious Design of
Debauching the Nation, and to baffle the Evidence
of the Popish Plots. And now, by the just
Judgment of God, the Clergy, who did but too
much Countenance the Proceedings of those
Reigns, are lash'd and expos'd in the Play-houses
themselves, which Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> complains of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This
it's hop'd will cure their Itch of Adorning or
rather disguising the Doctrines of the Gospel,
with the Phrase of the Stage, and their fondness
of Reading Plays for refining their Stile.</p>
            <p>No Clergy-man can propose to himself any
justifiable End in Reading Plays, but that which
Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> has excellently perform'd, to wit, the
exposing their Immorality and Profaneness, and to
discover their Failure in their pretended Designs.</p>
            <p>It is altogether unsufferable to hear a sort
of young Divines, Regale our Ears from the
Pulpit, with the Rhetorick of a Play, while at
the same time they Treat the Phrase of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and the Language of Antient and Learned
Divines as Unintelligible Cant; and yet that this
hath been, and is still too common amongst
some of our Clergy-men, cannot be denied:
So long as those Writings of <hi>Parkers</hi> and others,
which call the <hi>New Birth</hi> a <hi>Fantastical Iargon,</hi>
or those Sermons which treat the Doctrine of St.
<hi>Austin, Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> nay, and of the Articles
of the Church of <hi>England</hi> too, as Stuff and Cant,
have an Existence.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> and others may write Volumes
against the Stage as long as they please, but they
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98165:7"/>
will find it to little purpose, whilst the Plays are so
much read and incourag'd by the Clergy, and by 'em
retail'd again to the People. If the Language of
the Play-house be thought fit to be made use of,
as an Ornament to a Sermon, the Hearers will be
apt to conclude that the Stage is not so Criminal
a Thing as some Men would have it accounted.
And seeing Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> has been so much
approv'd for lashing the Poets and the Stage,
there's no reason to think that it should be taken
amiss in another, to censure the vanity of such of
the Clergy as write Plays or Preach in that
Dialect, and have neglected to inform their Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the Danger of the Play-house.</p>
            <p>Had they taken due care to instruct their Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
in this Matter at Church, the Audiences would
never have been so numerous at the Stage: For
why should I think there's any hurt in the Theatre,
when I see that its ordinary for our Gallants on a
<hi>Saturday</hi> to prepare themselves by a Play for
Hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing a Sermon on <hi>Sunday:</hi> Nay, sometimes it
may be for the Sacrament. And yet the Parson
hath not the Courage or Honesty to reprove it;
but perhaps chuses it as the most proper way to
recommend himself to the Applause of his Hearers,
to deliver his Preachment in the stile of a Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
            <p>Our Wits indeed, when passing their Judgment
on a Sermon, think they give the Preacher a large
Encomium, when they say he has read abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Play-Books. Which let our Youngsters
in Divinity value as they please, I should think
it the most picquant Satyr that could be put
upon me, were I worthy of bearing the Indelible
Character.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But that those flanting Preachers may have no
occasion to say that I am alone in this Matter,
I shall pray them to consider the following Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities.</hi>

in the Church, To labour for the Groans and
not for the Applause of his Hearers.—Not
to behave himself like a Declaimer of feigned Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
or a pretended Advocate, and to talk without
Measure. The Sermon of a Minister ought to be
seasoned with Quotations from Scripture<note n="*" place="margin">Epist. 22. c. 15.</note>. Prosper
Aquitanicus <hi>says,</hi> That a Preacher ought not to
value himself upon the Accuracy of his Stile, except
he have more mind to shew his own Learning, than
to edifie the Church of God. That his Sermon ought to
be so plain, that the most ignorant Persons may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
it; the business of Declaimers or Makers of
Orations being one thing, and that of Preachers ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:

days—the Doctrine of the Holy Scriptures is
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98165:8"/>
utterly lost; the Preachers being puffed up with
Knowledge, teach their own Notions. They extol
the Learning of the Heathen Philosophers, and
thereby darken the Sun-shine of Christian Wisdom:
And now most of the Schools, where Divinity was
formerly taught, are filled with Poetical <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ictions,
Empty Trifles and Monstrous Fables. The Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
hunt after their own Applause, and study to
gratifie the Ears of their Auditors with Ornat
and Polite Discourses; But true <hi>Sermons</hi> are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than those that are Elegant. And let those
Eloquent Doctors know, that our <hi>Saviour</hi> says of
them, <hi>In vain do ye Worship me, teaching for
Doctrines the Commandments of Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude this Point with the Authority
of the Apostle St. <hi>Paul</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 4.</note>; he commends his
own Sermons because his Speech and his Preaching
<hi>was not with enticing Words of Mans Wisdom, but
in demonstration of the Spirit and of Power;</hi> yet
this great Apostle of the Gentiles was brought up
at the Feet of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> and had more humane
Learning than 20 of our fluttering Doctors.</p>
            <p>It is not my design to cry down Eloquence in a
Preacher, nor to commend a rough way of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
from the Pulpit. Eloquence is the Gift of
God, and commended in the Preacher <hi>Apollos;</hi>
but at the same time we are told, <hi>That he was
mighty in the Scriptures and taught diligently the

               <note n="†" place="margin">Acts 18. 24, 25.</note>.</p>
            <p>It's reckoned highly prophane (and Mr. <hi>Collier</hi>
has smartly reproved it) for Poets to apply the
Phrase of the Scripture to the use of the Stage;
and I see no reason why <hi>Vice Versa,</hi> it should not

to quote an apposite Sentence or Verse, either

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98165:9"/>
himself hath taught us the contrary by his own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
when he tells the Cretians that one of
their own Poets says,

            <p>But it is an intolerable Affectation of Novelty,

            <p>It were an easie matter to quote as many Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
guilty of these Vanities, as Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> has
quoted Plays guilty of abusing Scripture; but for
obvious Reasons I forbear it. The only cause why I
mention it, is to shew that it is not the Poets alone,
that support the Credit of the Stage, and that what
is Criminal in a Poet, is ten times worse in a
Priest; and therefore they ought not to pass with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Reproof.</p>
            <p>It's known, there are many godly Persons
amongst our Clergy, who bewail those things,
and oppose them as much as they can; but there
is a mighty Neglect somewhere, and the World
will hardly be perswaded that our Church of
<hi>England</hi> is unanimous in this Matter, <hi>else it were
easie for them, who shook King</hi> James <hi>out of his
Throne, to overturn the Stage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is not to be supposed that the King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
would deny the Clergy such a Request, if it
were duly presented;</hi> and considering how much
the Nation hath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> suffered in its Morals and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98165:9"/>
by the Licentiousness of the Stage, it's high
time that some effectual Course should be taken to
suppress it.</p>
            <p>But there's reason to fear that the Faction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
by Arch-bishop <hi>Laud,</hi> has still too great an
interest amongst our Clergy; for scarcely can any
other reason be imagined, why, after so many
Years Experience of the Mischief of the Stage,
the Church should be so silent in this Matter.
That there is something in this, I am very apt to
think, because of the Deference many of the
Clergy men pay to the Memory of that Prelate,
and of his Master King <hi>Charles</hi> I. whom he help'd
to mislead. In those Times, as Mr. <hi>Prin</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints
us in his <hi>Histriomastix,</hi> none were accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Enemies to the Play-house but Puritans and
Precisians, and in opposition to them it probably
was that <hi>Laud</hi> and his Clergy became its Patrons;
and it is not unlike that many of the Less-thinking
Church-men continue still to favour it on that
Account, as being unwilling to condemn that, for
which King <hi>Charles</hi> I. and Arch-bishop <hi>Laud</hi>
testified so much Passion; but these Gentlemen
would do well to remember, <hi>That the Defence of
the Stage was never so much the Characteristick of
their church, as was the Doctrine of Passive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
and seeing the Majority of them have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquished
that, they are infinitely the more to blame
for still adhering to this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If a Petition of the <hi>Londoners</hi> had so much
Influence on Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> as to get the Play-houses
suppress'd, and if the Stage was expresly
condemned by a Statute of King <hi>Iames</hi> I. we
have no reason to despair of obtaining the same
now upon the like Application. And methinks
the Clergy <hi>are more concerned to stir in it than
ever, seeing it would appear by Mr.</hi> Collier's <hi>third
Chapter,</hi> Of the Clergy abused by the Stage, <hi>that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98165:10"/>
the Theatre is now become a Nusano<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is apparent enough from what has been said
already, that the Clergy are chargeable with the
Mischief of the Stage, by the omitting of what
their Character obliges them to do against it, and
that many of them are also Culpable by seeming
to hallow its Phrase in the Pulpit; but this is not
all, as will appear by what follows.</p>
            <p>We have heard that the Stage was condemned
by Act of Parliament in King <hi>Iames</hi> I. Time, but
reviv'd again in the Reign of K. <hi>Charles,</hi> contrary
to Law; and that Operas were practised in his
own Court, by his Royal Authority on <hi>Sundays.</hi>
Now considering how much that Prince was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted
to the Interest of the Clergy, it's highly
improbable that he would have atttempted any
such thing, had the then Governing part of the
Church given him faithful warning against it,
but <hi>Laud</hi> and the other topping Church-men of that
time, were so far from opposing it, that they concur'd
with him, &amp; imposed a Book of Sports and Pastimes,
upon all their Clergy, to be read to the People on
<hi>Sundays,</hi> which was a fair step towards converting
all the Churches of the Nation into Play-houses.</p>
            <p>This great Example did so much incourage the
Stage, that Mr. <hi>Prin</hi> tells us in his Book before-mentioned,
in two Years time there were above
40000 Play-Books printed: They became more
vendible than the choicest Sermons: Grew up
from Quarto's to Folio's; were printed on
far better Paper than most of the Octavo or
Quarto Bibles, and were more saleable than they.
And <hi>Shackspeers</hi> Plays in particular were printed
in the best<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Paper.—The two old Play-houses
were rebuilt and enlarged, and a new
Theatre erected; so that there were then six Play-houses
in <hi>London,</hi> twice the number of those in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98165:10"/>
               <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>Nero</hi>'s Time, which though a much more
spacious City, <hi>Seneca</hi> complains of as being too
many. That Faction of the Clergy became at
last so enamour'd of the Stage, that the same
Author informs us<note n="*" place="margin">pag. 935.</note>, He had heard some Preachers
call their Text a Land-skip or Picture, and others
a Play or Spectacle, dividing their Texts into
Actors, Spectators, Scenes, &amp;c. as if they had
been Acting a Play. Upon which he complains
of their using Play-house Phrases, Clinches and
strong Lines, as they called them; and that it
was to to frequent to have Sermons in respect of
their Divisions, Language, Action, Stile and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
Matter, fitter for the Stage from whence
they were borrowed, than for the Pulpit. He
tells us<note n="†" place="margin">pag. 929.</note> further, That one <hi>Atkinson</hi> a Minister
in <hi>Bedford,</hi> did the Christtide before, Act a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Interlude in the Commissaries House there,
where he made a Prayer on the Stage; chose the
Words, <hi>Acts 10. 14. I have never eaten any thing
that is common or unclean,</hi> for his Text; preached
prophanely upon it, and jested to the shame and
grief of most that heard him. In that same
place he complains that in private as well as in
popular Stage-plays, they represented Ministers
Preaching and Praying, and brought the Sacred
Bible and the Stories of it on the Stage, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Statute of 3. <hi>Iac. Cap.</hi> 21.</p>
            <p>The same Author tells us likewise<note n="*" place="margin">pag. 241.</note>, That
one <hi>Giles Widdowes</hi> in a Sermon at <hi>Carfolkes</hi> in
<hi>Oxford,</hi> on <hi>Psalm 68. verse</hi> 25. did avowedly
justifie the Lawfulness of mix'd Dancing at
Church-ales and Maypoles upon the Lords Day,
and confirm'd his Doctrine by his own Practise.
And page 700. he informs us of three Doctors of
Divinity, <hi>viz.</hi> Dr. <hi>Gager,</hi> Dr. <hi>Gentiles</hi> and Dr.
<hi>Case,</hi> who writ in Defence of Stage-plays. And
page 979. he insinuates, that diverse of the Clergy
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98165:11"/>
had acted and danced on publick and private
Stages.</p>
            <p>The Theatre having thus made so large a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
as to get the Court and the Governing part
of the Church on its side, grew <hi>Rampant,</hi> and as
if it disdained to have any less Adversary than
God himself, did boldly usurp on the Sabbath
Afternoons. And thus in the Year 1637. Masks
were set up at Court on <hi>Sundays,</hi> by His Majesties
Authority, while at the same time <hi>Laud</hi> and
his Faction forbad Preaching any oftner than once
a day, and that the common People who could
not bear the Expence, nor have the Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Stage-plays, might not want one however
to prophane the Sabbath, the Book of Sports and
Pastimes was enjoyned by the Bishops to be read
in the Churches by their Inferior Clergy on pain
of Deprivation.</p>

Sundays MASKS.</head>
            <p>THAT the World may see what a Noble
Exchange we had for our Afternoon Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
and Evening Lectures, I shall here
give an Account of the Mask that was presented
by the Kings Majesty at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> in 1637. on
the <hi>Sunday</hi> after <hi>Twelfth-night,</hi> Entituled,
BRITANNIA TRIUMPHANS,
by <hi>Inigo Iones</hi> Surveyer of His Majesties Works,
and <hi>William Davenant</hi> Her Majesties Servant.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:98165:11"/>
We are told in the Introduction, <hi rend="margQuotes">That for these
three Years their Majecties had intermitted those
Masques and Shews, because the Room where
they were formerly presented, having the See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
richly adorn'd since, with Painting of
great Value, Figuring the Acts of K. <hi>Iames</hi> of
blessed Memory, they were afraid it might suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
by the Smoke of the Lights, but His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
having now ordered a New Room to be
made on purpose, which was performed in two
Months, the Scenes for this Mask were prepared.</hi>
               <hi>Now who can say but these were Reasons becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Martyr?</hi> and that this was a frugal way of
spending his Treasure, when at the same time he
extorted Money from his Subjects in a Tyrannical
manner by <hi>Ship-money, Loans,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>We come now to the Subject of the Mask.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="margQuotes">
                  <hi>Britanocles,</hi> the Glory of the Western World,
hath by his Wisdom, Valour and Piety, not only
vindicated his own, but far distant Seas infested
with Pyrates, and reduc'd the Land by his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
to a real knowledge of all good Arts and
Sciences. These Eminent Acts <hi>Bellerophon</hi> in a
wise Pity, willingly would preserve from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
time, and therefore to make them last
to our Posterity, gives a command to Fame,
who hath already spread them abroad) that she
should now at home (if there can be any mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
insensible) awake them from theif pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Sleep, that even they, with the large, yet
still increasing Number of the Good and Loyal,
may mutually admire and rejoyce in our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This makes it evident enough, that the subject
was K. <hi>Charles</hi> himself, who had gained some ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98165:12"/>
against the Pirates of <hi>Barbary,</hi> the praise
of which there was none would have envied him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but this was a new way of singing <hi>Te Deum;</hi> no
great Argument of Religion, and far less any
Presage that he should become a Martyr for it,
to order a Masque for his own praise, upon that
day, which by Divine Institution was set apart for
the praise of our Redeemer.</p>
            <p>The next thing we have an Account of is,
<hi rend="margQuotes">That the Queen being sat under the State, and
the Room fill'd with Spectators of Quality, a
Stage was raised at the lower end with an Oval
Stair down into the Room. The first thing
which presented it self to the Eye, was the
Ornament that inclosed the Scene. In the under
part of which were two Pedestals of a solid
Order, whereon the Captives lay bound; above
sat two Figures in Neeches; on the right hand
a Woman in a Watchet Drapery, heightened
with Silver; on her Head a <hi>Corona Rostrata,</hi>
with one Hand holding the Rudder of a Ship,
and in the other a little winged Figure, with a
branch of Palm and a Garland. This Woman
was to represent Naval Victory. In the other
Neech on the left, sat the Figure of a Man,
bearing a Scepter, with a Hand and an Eye in
the Palm, and in the other hand a Book; on
his Head a Garland of <hi>Amaranthus;</hi> his Curace
was of Gold with a <hi>Palludamentum</hi> of Blue,
and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Antick Bases of Crimson; his Foot tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the Head of a Serpent. This Figure was
to represent Right Government: Above these
were Ornaments cut out like Cloath of Silver,
tied up in Knots, with Scarsings all touch'd with
Gold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="margQuotes">These Pillasters bore up a large Freese, with
a Sea-Triumph of naked Children riding on<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98165:12"/>
Sea-Horses, and Fishes, and young Trito<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> with
writhen Trumpets, and other Maritime Fancies.
In the midst was placed a great Compartiment
of Gold, with branches of Palm coming out
of the Scrols; and within that a lesser of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
with this Inscription, <hi>Virtutis Opus,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to the Subject of this Mask, and alluding to
that of <hi>Virgil, Sed famam Extendere fuctis;</hi> from
this came a Drapery of Crimson, which being
tied up with great Knots in the Corners, hung
down in Foulds on the sides of the Pillasters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="margQuotes">A Curtain flying up discovered the first Scene,
wherein were English Houses of the old and

               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>So much for the Pomp of this <hi>Sunday</hi>'s Theatre.
And let any Man who has the least sense of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
judge, whether it does not smell strong of
that Pomp and Vanity of the World, which
Christians abjure at Baptism, and was by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
the most unbecoming Exercise for a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
that could be invented, as having an unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
Tendency to take up the Thoughts of the
Actors and Spectators throughout the whole day,
and to wear off the Impressions of any Sermons,
they might have heard in the former part of it.</p>
            <p>But we come now to the Opera it self.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="margQuotes">From different parts of the Scene came <hi>Action</hi>
and <hi>Imposture. Action</hi> a Young Man in a rich
Habit down to his Knees, with a large Guard
of Purple about the Skirt, wherein was written
with Silver Letters <hi>Medio tutissima;</hi> on his
Head a Garland of Lawrel, and in one Hand a
branch of Willow. <hi>Imposture</hi> came in a Coat
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98165:13"/>
of Hanging-Sleeves and great skirts, little Bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
an high crown'd Hat one side pin'd up, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
little Ruff, and a formal Beard; an Angling-ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
in his Hand, with a Fish at the Hook, and a Bag
and Horn at his Girdle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is easie to discern, that the design of this was
to represent the graver sort of People in those
times, as Impostors and Cheats, and that they
only pretended to Gravity and Religion the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to hide their Covetousness and other Lusts;
but methinks the High-crown'd Hat turn'd up on
one side, the little Ruff and the formal Beard,
might have been forborn out of respect to the King
and his Father; the latter in most of his Pictures
is represented to us in such a Hat and Ruff, and
a Beard formal to the utmost; and the Son is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
drawn with his Collar-Band, and a Beard
so formal, that were it not for his Armour and
Battoon of Command, we should take him sooner
for a Bishop than a King. But we must remember
it was a Mask! The Court made haste enough to
pull off the Vizard afterwards.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Action</hi> enters first, and I suppose this Name was
given him, because he must be thought to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
what the other only pretended to. He rants
at <hi>Imposture,</hi> not with an Oath! that was not
King <hi>Charles</hi>'s Crime; for to give him his due,
they say he abhor'd Swearing; and therefore
<hi>Action,</hi> like one that would keep the middle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Dammee Ruffian, and the Precise Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
falls upon <hi>Imposture,</hi> with an Adjuration;

            <p>Here the Poet explains whom he meant by
<hi>Imposture,</hi> when he brings him in attacking the
Episcopal Dignity, and would persuade the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
that he was for Anarchy too; so that the
Constable shall not escape his lash, though he
moves in the very lowest Orb of Civil Authority.
This was calculated for the then Meridian of
<hi>Lambeth,</hi> to represent those that were against
Arch-bishop <hi>Laud</hi>'s Prid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> and Innovations in the
Church, as Enemies likewise to the State.</p>
            <p>But, by the Poets leave, he makes his <hi>Imposture</hi>
speak quite out of Character, when he brings him
to an open Profession of his design to cheat Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.
Impostors are more cunning than to do so;
they put on Sheeps Cloathing, though they be
inwardly Ravening Wolves: So that he should
rather have called him a <hi>professed Atheist,</hi> than an
<hi>Imposter,</hi> when he appears thus in his proper
Colours, and that to his professed Enemy too.</p>

that adher'd to the Doctrine of the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> against <hi>Laud</hi>'s Arminianism: The charge
is no less, than that they are Enemies to the
Church, and accuse God of Tyranny towards
Men. Whilst Birds and Beasts frisk and flutter
about in their gawdy Furs and Feathers, we poor
Mortals are called to Mourning, Repentance and
Humiliation; a sort of Doctrine the Stage will
have nothing to do with, except it be to ridicule
it. But here's not one word all this while, that
Man hath sinn'd, and therefore must sorrow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he can lay any solid Claim to be a sharer in
Joy. That was none of the Poets business; he was
to preach up Mirth and Jollity, and to perswade
to it by an unanswerable Argument. The Beas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s
and Birds are so, and therefore we should be so
too. Then at the Conclusion, comes the old
false Charge against Seriousness in Religion. It
deprives us of all the Comforts of Life; and
condemns us to Rags and Melancholy; enough to
make the Gallants of the Audience out of Love
with it for all their Days, and to ridicule Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of all sorts; a proper Work for the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Sabbath.</p>

            <p>One can hardly imagine what was the design

vanishes, and there appears a vast Forrest, in

Giant:</hi> Who by his Character, one of those
in <hi>Guild-hall,</hi> was not big enough to be his Page.
He is described thus,</p>

               <l>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:98165:17"/>
His Hook was such as heads the end of Pole</l>

               <l>His Hook was baited with a Dragons Tail,</l>

and equally fit for a Digestion after Sermon on

            <p>
               <hi>The rest I'll venture briefly to tell in Prose,
for the Verse is not (in my Opinion) very char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</hi>
—The Giant in his way home spied a
Knight and a Lady under a Hedge, within his Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieus,
and laying down his Whale goes toward them
in great fury spurning up Trees by the Roots as
he went; asks the Knight how he and his Damsel

Cook to dress his Whale, and threatens to beat out
the Knights Brains with an Oaken Tree, if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
her. The Lady made an Apology, That they
came thither only to gather Sloes and Bullies—.
The Knight takes him up sharply for offering such
a Disgrace to his Lady; and at last by <hi>Merlin</hi>'s
Art, the Scuffle was turned into Fantastick Musick,
and a Dance.</p>
            <p>I pass over the rest of this impertinent Stuff,

a while; tho' I think he could scarcely be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained

If the Reader think I have inserted too much of
it, he may be pleased to consider that it is very
rare and sarcely to be had, and being extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
because of its having been Acted on a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath

a large Account of it; that he might see what
sort of Religion or Evening Sermons, it was
that the Court and <hi>Laud</hi>'s Faction of the Church
then aimed at.</p>

Let any Man that has but the least impression

and declare his Opinion, whether it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
that Character of Piety and Chastity which
some Men will have K. <hi>Charles</hi> the first to have
been endowed with. There's no Man can deny but
it has an amorous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Tendency, and must of necessity
leave quite another impression upon the Minds of
the Hearers, than the blessing which they heard
pronounced at Church after Sermon ought to have
done, and that the whole Interlude could serve
for nothing else but to divert their Meditations
from whatever was serious; and therefore the
setting up of Masks, and Sports and Pastimes
upon <hi>Sundays</hi> and Holydays, was one of the most
effectual Methods that the Enemies of Piety could
have invented, to hinder the effect of those Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,

there is no honest Mirth or Recreation allowed in
our Religion, and the setting up of filthy Tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling
and Drinking and breeds a number of idle
and discontented Speeches on those days. His
express Pleasure therefore was, that no lawfull
Recreation should be barr'd to his good People,
and that the Bishops should take strict order with
all Puritans and Precisians, and either constrain
'em to conform themselves or to leave the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.

Archery, Leaping, Vaulting, nor from having of

as tended to debauch the Morals of the People,
and yet will not shew the least favour to the
stricter sort of Protestants, but brands them with
the Nick-names of Puritans and Precisians, and
Orders his Bishops to bring them to Conformity,
or to expel them the Country. But the pleasantest
Jest is this, That he invites them to come to

               <p>Now out of the like pious Care for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice

do Ratifie and Publish this our Blessed Fathers
Declaration.</p>
            </q>
            <p>This Declaration did but too much verifie what
an old Reverend Divine of the Church of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
said to King <hi>Iames</hi> I. when he asked his
Blessing on his Journey, to take upon him the
Crown of <hi>England,</hi> viz. <hi>Pray God bless you Sir,
and make you a good Man, but he has ill stuff to

            </p>
            <p>The Declaration adds,—<q>We command that

            </p>
            <p>Here was a great difference betwixt the Exercise
of the Episcopal Function in the Reigns of the
Father and the Son: or by this Declaration <hi>Ch.</hi> I.
made the Bishops Trumpeters to the Stage, and
King <hi>Iames</hi> II, said, that in his Time they were
Trumpeters of Rebellion, because they petitioned
against Reading the Declaration for Liberty of
Conscience. This Declaration for <hi>Sports</hi> was read
by most of them; and such of the Ministers as
would not conform, were turned out till the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:98165:23"/>
Controversies betwixt the King and Parliament,
and the Civil War that ensued put a stop to it.</p>
            <p>Thus I have made it plain, That the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
part of the Church patroniz'd the Stage in the
Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> I. and by the Book call'd <hi>Centuries
of scandalous Ministers,</hi> we find, that many of them
were turned out for frequenting the Stage in the
Parliament Times, and the Theatre being then
overturned, there was so great a Reform of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
that notwithstanding the Libertinism which
usually accompanies War, one might have walk'd
through the City and Suburbs without hearing an
Oath; but when King <hi>Charles</hi> II. was restored,
the Play-houses were speedily re-opened, and
without any Publick Check or Control from the
Church, went on to that height of Immorality,
which Mr. C. complains of. Nay, they were thought
very subservient to support the Church by jerk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the Whigs and Dissenters in their Prologues
and Plays, and to infuse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rightful Ideas of them
into the Heads of the Spectators, whilst at the
same time they run down the belief of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
Plot, vindicated the Traitors that had been
executed for it, and dress'd the true Patriots of
our Religion and Liberty in the Skins of Beasts of
prey, that they might be devoured with the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Appetite. It were easie to cram a Volume
with Instances of this sort, but they are so well
known, that 'tis needless. There being no Body
who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>requented the Play-house or read the Plays

was attempered to the Lascivious and Arbitrary

               </gap>s of those Princes, and to blacken all
those that opposed their Tyrannical Designs.</p>
            <p>Having thus made it appear that the Church
hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>avoured the Stage, by their not warning
the People against it, by seeming to hallow the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98165:23"/>
Phrase of it in their Pulpits, by approving or at
least conniving at the practise of it on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
in King <hi>Charles</hi> I. by prosecuting those who
writ against it, Writing Plays themselves, by some
of them practising it in their own Persons, and
Writing in Defence of it, by enjoining the Book
of <hi>Sports<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> by not opposing it in the Reigns of
<hi>Charles</hi> II. and <hi>Iames</hi> II. and (to which I shall add)
by their not opposing it in this Reign, when they
might have hopes of better success, seeing both
King and Parliament have declared themselves so
highly against Immorality and Profaneness: I
come now in the next place to see how far the
Schools are chargeable with the same Crime.</p>

            <p>It will appear plain from the very Nature and
Design of Christian Schools, That such things
ought not to be taught in them. The end of all
such Schools is to teach Wisdom and Vertue, that
we may know God and our selves; and how to
Worship God aright; whereas the quite contrary
is taught by those Authors. <hi>Homer, Hesiod, Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar,
Aristophanes, Virgil, Horace,</hi> and the rest of
those Heathen Authors, arriv'd to that height of
Impiety and Madness, that they feign'd such
lewd things to be acted by their Gods, as a modest
Man cannot but be ashamed to reh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

Youth; for they represent their Gods and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desses
to be such, as no honest or well-governed
Common-wealth, would have admitted them
for Citizens, so that <hi>Palingenius</hi> writes truly of
them.</p>

            <p>There's no doubt but the Heathen Poets were
influenced by Satan, to feign such Monstrous and
Horrid Things concerning their Deities, that they
might thereby promote and Authorize Whoredom
and Uncleanness among Men, and add Fewel to
the Flames of Corrupt Nature. Certainly those
Fables in <hi>Ovid</hi>'s <hi>Metamorphosis,</hi> concerning the
Amous, nay, Rapes of the Gods and others,
cannot leave any Chast Impressions upon the Minds
of Youth. What a fulsom Expression is that of
<hi>Virgil, Aneid. 7. Mista Deo Mulier.</hi> The danger
of teaching such things to Youth was seen by the
very Heathen Philosophers: And therefore <hi>Plato</hi>
says, <q>That those fabulous Stories of the Poets,
were not to be receiv'd into a City, as if the
Gods wag'd War, and form'd Ambushes against
one another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whether they be taken in an
Allegorical Sense or not; For Children (says he)
cannot distinguish betwixt what is spoke figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
or otherwise, and such Opinions as they
drink in when they are young, they can hardly
ever lay aside. To feign that God, who is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
Good, is the Cause of Evil, is an Error
that ought to be refuted; and therefore the Poets
should be compelled to write and speak things
that are honest <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. de Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that its evident what Moral Sayings of

than from their polluted Streams; And as for the
purity of the Latine Tongue, it may as well be
learnt from others, as from the Poets. The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Histories</hi> are excellent for that end; and if
their Poets were purg'd from their Obscenities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and so put into the Hands of Youth, there could
be nothing to object against 'em. Nor are there wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
excellent Latine Poems by Christian Authors,
which might be equally serviceable for instructing
our Youth in the purity of the Latine Tongue, and
inspring them also with true Christian Sentiments,
such as the famous Antient Poems of <hi>Tertullian,
Arator, Apollinaris, Nazianzen, Prudentius, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper</hi>

            <p>That a Reform of the Schools in this Point

            </p>
            <p>Before I come directly to the Point, it may not
be improper to observe, that considering the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
Influence, which the Stage hath had upon
the Corruption of Manners, so much complained
of. It seems no very suitable Imployment for
one Divine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> to espouse
the Defence of the Stage against another. Nor
is it very much for the Defendants Honour to
make use of Arrows from a Popish Quiver; for
we have no Reason to think that a Popish Divine
will be a Cordial Enemy to the Stage; when the
Worship of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their Church does so much resemble
the Pomp of the Theatre.</p>
            <p>The Doctors first Argument is, <hi>That the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

PLAYS, [Page 10.] Which admitted to be

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:98165:27"/>
being many thousands of things for which it
serves as a Rule, that it doth not particularly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press:
So that the Doctors Argument would be

               </gap>able to the Great Turk: There's

and Plainly infer'd from the Scriptures, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we are not to receive any other Doctrine
than is there taught us, therefore we are not
to receive <hi>Mahomet</hi> as a Prophet.</p>
            <p>By Consequences of like force, and every whit
as plain, we shall find Stage-Plays condemned in
Scripture; I mean not only those that are guilty
of Immorality, Profaneness, Blasphemy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
which the greatest Patrons of the Stage, will not
offer to defend, but even Stage-Plays in general,
whose Business they will have it to be, to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
Vertue and discountenance Vice, which I
think will be very plain by the following Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>That which God hath appointed sufficient Means
to Accomplish: It is Unlawful for Men to
appoint other Means to Accomplish: But
Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> hath appointed sufficient Means for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending
Vertue, and Discountenancing
Vice <hi>without the STAGE: Ergo,</hi> It is
Unlawful for Men to appoint the Stage for
Recommending Vertue and Discountenancing
Vice.</p>
            <p>All t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e Controversie will lie about the first
Proposition; but I think there's no Man who has
a serious Impression of the infinite Wisdom,
Power and Goodness of God upon his Mind, that
will call it in Question, seeing he must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
by so doing, cast a Reflection upon all those
Attributes, and prefer the Wisdom, Power and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:98165:28"/>
Goodness of Man, to the Wisdom, Power and
Goodness of GOD.</p>
            <p>The second Proposition is clear from express
Texts of Scripture. The Apostle tells us, <hi>That
Magistracy is the Ordinance of God: That Rulers
are ordained by him to be a Terror to evil Works,
and to Praise those that do good: And that they are
the Ministers of God, continually attending upon
this very thing,</hi> Rom. 13. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Whence
it is evident, That the Original End and Design
of Magistracy, is to Encourage Vertue and to
Punish Vice.</p>
            <p>And hence it is equally clear, That seeing Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
is a Species of Reward, and Lashing and
Exposing a sort of Punishment, the pretended
Service of the Stage, for those Ends is wholly
needless; God having sufficiently provided for
that, by appointing Magistrates.</p>
            <p>This being so, the Patrons of the Stage have
no other Pretences left them, but such as Mr. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi>
enumerates briefly in his Introduction, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <q>That the Stage is useful to shew the uncertainty
of Humane Greatness; The sudden turns of
Fate, and the unhappy Conclusions of Violence
and Injustice; To expose the Singularities of
Pride and Fancy; To make Folly and Falshhood
Contemptible; And to bring every thing that is
Ill, under Infamy and Neglect.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But we are infinitely better provided for those
Ends, by</hi> the Word of GOD, <hi>and</hi> the Ordinance

            <p>
               <hi>Thus the second Proposition is plainly proved,</hi>
That God hath provided sufficient Means for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending
Vertue and Discountenancing Vice
<hi>without</hi> the STAGE: <hi>Ergo</hi> it is Unlawful to
Appoint the Stage for Recommending Vertue and
Discountenancing Vice.</p>
            <p>It may perhaps be objected, That by this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
the Exhortations and Reproofs of Parents,
Masters and Neighbours, are also prov'd to be
needless: To which the Answer is ready, That
those Duties are enjoyn'd by the Scriptures on
Parents, Masters and Neighbours; therefore 'tis
the Ministers Duty to urge them, and the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
Duty to see them perform'd; but no such
thing can be said of the Stage.</p>
            <p>It may perhaps be further objected, That the
Magistrate being left at Liberty, as to the <hi>Means
of Recommending Virtue and Discountenancing Vice,</hi>
he may appoint the Stage for that End. To
which I Answer; The Magistrate is infinitely bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
provided of Means already: He hath the
Ministers to preach the Gospel from the Pulpit;
and Judges to explain his Laws from the Bench<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and is provided with a Sword to protect Vertue
and punish Vice.</p>
            <p>And therefore to spend Time and Money in that
which is needless, would be not only contrary to
Scripture Rule, but to Common-sense. Nor can
the Patrons of the Stage, give us an Instance,
that ever any Magistrate appointed the Stage for
those Ends they mention.</p>

               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:98165:29"/>We are told in the Introduction to <hi>Britania

            <p>It's plain, that the <hi>Paris</hi> Dr. or his Translator
make <hi>Aquinas</hi> say what he never intended. The

nothing is Criminal with the Parisian Dr. or his

They would make the World believe, That the
African Father was only against giving whole
Estates to Players too; when the honest Man says
expresly, That to give any thing to a Stage-Player
except at the Point of Starving, is a monstrous

And how well <hi>Aquinas</hi> reconciles the School-men
with the Fathers, in this Point of the Stage, may
be seen by the very following Article, where he

            </p>
            <p>Nor is there any of the Fathers more Pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
and Pressing in their Exhortations to Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
to avoid the Stage, than this Excellent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
as may be seen in his <hi>Homilies,</hi> and other Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</p>
            <p>Then as to the whim of the Revelation to
<hi>Paphnutius,</hi> That a certain Player should be his
Partner in Glory, by which <hi>Aquinas</hi> would prove
that Players are not in a State of Sin. However
it may relish with the <hi>Paris</hi> Doctor, it sounds
but ill to be quoted by a Divine of the Church
of <hi>England;</hi> But admitting the Revelation to
be true, it will not prove what they would have
it, for the Player mentioned, might have aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
the Stage, and become a true Penitent;
otherwise by this way of arguing, Thieves may
conclude, that they are not in a State of Sin,
because our Saviour said to one on the Cross,
<hi>This day shalt thou be with me in Paradise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Besides, <hi>Aquinas</hi>'s Words are, <hi>Quod quidam

Now the Doctor knows, that <hi>Ioculator</hi> and
<hi>Histrio,</hi> are not convertible Terms. There are
many Jocose Men, that would think the Stage
below them; or if <hi>Ioculator</hi> must needs be a

or Fool in the Play; there's no reason why such
should be denied the Benefit of <hi>Pap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

for Heaven,</hi> it being but seldom, that their
part of the Play is the most Criminal.</p>
            <p>In the next Place, it ought to be observed what
sort of Plays they are, which St. <hi>Thomas</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves;
he says, <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

which are directed to recreat or solace Men,

are not unlawful in themselves. This is quite
another Work than our Stage now assumes to it
self, as Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> mentions in his Introduction;
and had the Stage held there, and been regular
and moderate in its practice, it would not have
been so culpable as now it is, but all this is
meerly a covering its Nakedness with Fig-leaves:
that was not the Original Design of the Stage.
It was invented by the Devil, if we may believe

            <p>Before I go further, I must observe two Things;

the present practice of the English Stage, in jesting
with Scripture, using obscene Words or Actions,
and Men and Womens putting on Apparel of the

            <p>In the next place they bring us St. <hi>Thomas</hi>'s

are become so mad, that though they profess
Religion, and are grown white with Old-Age,
they run to them notwithstanding; and say, they

               <p>In his thirty eighth <hi>Homily</hi> on <hi>Matthew,</hi> He
answers the Question: What then shall we shut

being overturned, you shall not overthrow

Would to God they were pulled down; yet I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
you not to pull them down; the Magnifc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
of the Houses may stand, and the Plays
and Dancing cease. Take at least Example from
the Barbarians, who have none of those Stage-Plays.
What Excuse can you bring for your selves,
who are registred in Heaven, to be the Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Co-heirs with Angels if you be found
worse than the Barbarians in this, especially when
thou mayst procure to thy self better Comfort
elsewhere? for when thou wouldst refresh thy

               <q>
                  <p>The Barbarians themselves when they heard of
these Stage-Plays, uttered Expressions worthy
of the greatest Philosophers; What say they,
have the Romans no Wives nor Children? But
thou wilt say, these Playhouses do no Hurt. Yes,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:98165:34"/>
verily they do, in that thou spendest thy time
there Idlely and to no purpose, and givest cause
of Scandal to others. For though thou by For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
and Sublimeness of Mind hast escaped the
Infection, yet by giving Example to others who
are weaker, thou hast occasioned their commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

                  <p>In his seventy fourth <hi>Homily</hi> on <hi>Matthew,</hi> he

Comedies to be Acted in Nunneries, for though
they consisted of Sacred and Pious Subjects, they
can notwithstanding leave little good, but much
hurt in the Minds of holy Virgins, who behold

forbad the Acting of Comedies in Monastries, or
that Virgins should be Spectators of them.</p>

expresly condemning the Stage, and that of

in declaring against the Stage, but that any of
her Clergy should appear to defend it, as that
Dr. does, who sent the Letter to M. <hi>Motteux,</hi> to

to ruin all Opinion and Esteem of Virtue; so
the Conduct throughout, the Language, the Fable

the first who appear'd from the Pulpit or Press
upon this Subject. I must put him in mind of
others that have Writ and Preached against the
Stage long before those I have already mentioned:
And I think Mr. <hi>Prin,</hi> Author of the <hi>Histriomastix,</hi>
deserves the Honour of being nam'd with the
first. His Treatise being perhaps the Largest,
Learnedst and most Elaborate of any that ever
was writ upon the Subject, and to which Mr.

things in his ingenious Book, as I own here once
for all, I am highly oblig'd my self for not a few,
though I have made use of them in a different

               <p>I have already agreed with the Author of the

of late against the Stage, is a Neglect of their
Christian Duty; but shall now make it appear,

built his Theatre as a Horse-Fair for Whores,
made Triumphs, and set up Plays to gather fair
Women together, that every one of his Souldiers
might take where he lik'd, a snatch for his

them so sharply when he takes them Napping,

them Pippins to pass the time, such playing at

               </note>, <q>That they are
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:98165:56"/>
not to be suffered in a Christian Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
because they are Enemies to Nature and
Religion, Allurements unto sin, Corrupters of
good Manners, the Cause of Security and Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesness
in Religion, and meer Brothel-houses of
Bawdry: They bring a Scandal upon the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
the Sabbath into Contempt, Mens Souls
into danger, and the whole Commonwealth
into Disorder.—These are bitter and
hainous Expressions you will say, no doubt; yet
they are nothing so bitter as the Cause requireth.
It were ill to paint the Devil like an Angel, he
must be drawn as he is, that he may be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

should not be deceived with that wherewith I
have been deceived my self, I thought it my
Duty to expose the Abuse of the Plays and
Actors both, that every Man might refrain from
their Wickedness, and that the Magistrate being
informed of it, might take effectual Methods
utterly to suppress them; for if they still be
permitted to make Sale of Sin, we shall pull
the Vengeance of God upon our Heads, and
bring the Nation to Confusion.—What
I speak of Plays from my own Knowledge,
may be affirmed by Hundreds more, who know
those Matters as well as my self.—Some
Citizens Wives, upon whom God hath laid his
Hand for an Example to others, have confessed
on their Death-bed with Tears, that at those
Spectacles they have receiv'd such Infection, as
of honest Women made them light Huswifes:
By them they have dishonoured the Vessels of
Holiness, brought their Husbands into Contempt,
their Children in Question, their Bodies into
Sickness, and their Souls into Danger.</q>

            <p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:98165:56"/>It must be own'd, that this is an heavy Charge
upon the Stage, nor can the Truth of it be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned,
seeing it comes from the Hand of a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent
Stage-Poet, who delivers it as his own
certain Knowledge, but if his Testimony and that
of Mr. <hi>Gosson</hi> before exhibited be not enough;
The Patrons of the Stage may be pleased to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
that their Evidence is confirmed by Bishop

            <q>
               <p>The repair of such as are honest to those
Places of Evil Resort, makes their own Good
Life to be called in Question; for that Place

Bad; for who can see a Man or a Woman Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort
to an House that is notoriously Wicked, but
will judge them to be of the Crew of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly.
The honestest Woman is the soonest
assaulted, and hath such Snares laid to entrap
her, as if God assist her not, she must needs be
taken. When I gave my self first to observe the
Abuse of Common-plays, I found my Heart sore
smitten with Sorrow; Sin did there so much
abound, and was so openly committed, that I
looked when God in his Justice and Wrath
would have presently confounded the Beholders.
The Theatre I found to be an appointed Place of
Baudry: mine own Ears have heard honest Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
allur'd with abominable Speeches. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
I have seen two Knaves at once impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuning
one Light Huswife, whence a Quarrel
hath ensued to the Disquieting of many. There
are Intrigues carried on to debauch Married
Women from their Husbands, and Places ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for Meeting and Conference.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:98165:57"/>When I took notice of those Abuses, and saw
that the Theatre was become Satan's Council<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>House,
I resolved never to imploy my Pen to so
vile a Purpose, nor to be an Instrument of gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Wicked together.—It may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
be said, I am too lavish of my Discourse,
and that what I have now said might have been
forborn; but he that dissembles Ungodliness is a
Traitor to God, and as guilty of the Offence
as the Offenders themselves. Since therefore
the Cause is Gods, I dare put my self forth to
be an Advocate against Satan to the rooting out
of Sin. Are not our Eyes at Plays carried away
with Pride and Vanity, our Ears abus'd with
Amorous and Filthy Discourse, our Tongues
imployed in Blaspheming God or commending
that which is Wicked? Are not our Hearts
through the Pleasure of the Flesh, the Delight of
the Eye, and the fond Motions of the Mind,
withdrawn from the Service of God, and the
Meditation of his Goodness.—There's no
Zealous Heart but must needs bleed to see how
many Christian Souls are there swallow'd up in
the Whirlpool of Devilish Impudence. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
shall visit the Chappel of Satan [I mean
the Theatre] shall find there no want of young
Russians, nor lack of Harlots, utterly void of
Shame; who by their Wanton Gestures and
Shameless Behaviour discover what they are,
—Let Magistrates assure themselves
that without speedy Redress all things will grow
so much out of order that they will be past
remedy. Our young Men are thereby made
Shameless, Stubborn and Impudent. Tell them
of Scripture, they will turn it into Ridicule:
Rebuke them for breaking the Sabbath, they
will call you a Precisian.—</p>

                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:98165:57"/>
He that is virtuously disposed, shall find lewd
Persons enough in the Play-house to withdraw
him from Vertue by Promises of Pleasure and
Pastime. The Play-house is the School of Satan,
the Chapple of ill Council, where he shall see
so much of Iniquity and Loosness; so great
Outrage and Scope of Sin, that it is a wonder
if he return not either wounded in Conscience
or changed in Life. I would wish therefore all
Masters to withdraw themselves and their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
from such Assemblies. Youth needs not
seek after Schoolmasters, they can learn Evil too
fast of themselves. Many young Men of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
Natures and tractable Dispositions, have
been chang'd by those Shews and Spectacles,
and become Monsters.</p>
               <p>It is wonderful to consider, of what force the
Gestures of a Player (which <hi>Tully</hi> calls the Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of the Body) are to move and prepare a
Man for that which is evil.—Nothing
entre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that which cometh by seeing; things heard do
lightly pass away, but the Ideas of what we have

will or not.</p>
               <p>Those Enchantments have vanquish'd the Chas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of many Women, some by taking pity of
the deceitful Tears of the Lover on the Stage,
have been mov'd by their Complaint, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate
their secret Friends, whom they
thought to have felt the like Torment. Some
having observ'd the Examples, how young Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
being restrain'd from the Marriage of those
their Friends have mislik'd, have there learn'd
the Art to Steal them away; others observing
by the Example of the Stage, how another Mans
Wife hath been assaulted and overcome, have
not failed to practise those tricks in earrest, that
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:98165:58"/>
were shewn before them in Jest: Yet the cunning
Craft of the Stage, is surpassed by that of the
Scaffolds without, for they which are evil dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,

may serve their turns, but they apply it: Alas!
say they to the Gentlewomen by them, Is it not

and if they find them inclin'd to foolish pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

they apply the matter to themselves, and pray
that they would extend the same Compassion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them, as they seemed to shew to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted

the Manners of Youth, insomuch, that it is a
Miracle if there be found any Woman or Maid,
which with those Spectacles of strange Lust, is
not frequently inflam'd to down right Fury.</p>

was not alike. There's few that read Plays or

Retrograde, which verifies an Observation of them

it will be impossible to keep our publick Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies

wanton Behaviour at the Play-house, that they
smell strong of the Infection, when they come to

            <p>THE antient Romans held Players in so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
Disgrace and Contempt, because
of their vicious and dissolute Lives, that
they dis-franchis'd and removed them from their

and the noble Parentage from whence they deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
their Original, and totally Banish'd them at

Country, upon the same account, as we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready

            <p>HE falls next upon Mr. <hi>Collier</hi>'s Quotations
from the Fathers, the Defects of which
I shall not now offer to supply, having
quoted the Fathers, whose meaning the Advocates
of the Stage would pervert, at large already; I
shall only therefore take notice of the Reviewers
Assertion; That <hi>Tertullians</hi> Arguments are chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

a bewitching thing, and that the Magistrates dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenanced

            </p>
            <p>The Falshood of this Assertion will be obvious
to every one, that reads what I have quoted from
<hi>Tertullian,</hi> under the Head, of the <hi>Fathers against
the Stage;</hi> but as a further answer, I shall give
him Dr. <hi>Hornecks</hi> excellent Abridgment of <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullians</hi>
Arguments,<note n="†" place="margin">pag. 227.</note> in his Book of Delight and
Judgment, as follows.</p>
            <q>
               <p>I know what is commonly objected, That the
Reasons why the Fathers, are so much against
the Christians seeing of a Play, was because
the Heathenish Idolatries were acted to the Life,
upon the Stage, and that Proselites might not be
in danger of being entic'd to Idolatry, was a
great Motive why they inveighed so much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Sights of that Nature: But those that
use this Plea, must certainly not have read the
Fathers, or if they have read them, have not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
all their Arguments; for to go no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:98165:73"/>
than <hi>Tertullian;</hi> after he had condemned
those Sights, for the Idolatries committed on
the Stage; he produces other Reasons, for
which they are utterly unlawful<note n="†" place="margin">Tertul. de Spec. c. 15.</note>. As,</p>
               <p>I. Because the Spirit of the Gospel is a Spirit of
Gentleness; but the Actors are forc'd to put
themselves into a Posture of Wrath, and Anger,
and Fury, and the Spectators themselves cannot
behold them, without being put into a Passion.</p>
               <p>II. Because Vanity, which is proper to the
Stage, is altogether Forreign to Christianity.</p>
               <p>III. Because we are not to consent to Peoples
Sins.<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

               </p>
               <p>IV. Because Men are abus'd in these Places,
and neither Princes nor People spared, and this
bieng unlawful else where, must be unlawful
too upon the Stage.<note n="†" place="margin">cap. 17.</note>
               </p>
               <p>V. Because all Immodesty and Scurrillity is
forbid, by the Law of the Gospel, and not only
acting it, but seeing and hearing it acted.</p>
               <p>VI. Because all Players are Hypocrites<note n="†" place="margin">cap. 23.</note>, seem
to be what they are not, and all Hypocrisy is
condemned by the Gospel.</p>
               <p>VII. Because the Actors very often belie their
Sex, and put on Womens Apparel; which
is forbid by the Law of God.</p>
               <p>VIII. Because these Plays dull and damp De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
and Seriousness, which is and ought to be
the indelible Character of Christians<note n="*" place="margin">cap. 25.</note>.</p>
               <p>IX. Because it is a Disparagement to God, to
lift up those Hands to applaud a Player, which
we use to lift up to the Throne of Grace.</p>
               <p>X. Because Experience shews, how the Devil
hath sometimes possessed Christians in a Play-house,
and being afterwards cast out, confessed
that he had reason to enter into them, because
he found them in his own Place<note n="†" place="margin">cap. 27.</note>.</p>
               <p>XI. Because no Man can serve two Masters,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:98165:74"/>
God and the World, as those Christians pretend
to do, that frequent both the Church and Stage.</p>
               <p>XII. Because though some Speeches in a Play
are Witty and Ingenious, yet there is poison at
the Bottom, and Vice is only coloured and gild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with fine Language and curious Emblems; that
it may go down more glib, and ruine the Soul
more artificially.</p>

of his Wit and Banter against <hi>

of his possessing a Christian Woman, that he
found her on his own Ground, [<hi>viz.</hi> the Play-house]
—Such a Discovery, he thinks the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil

he considered those several Passages of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,

Authority have any Weight with him, there he

and that the Credit of that Learned Father, for
the great Service he did to the Christian Cause,
has set him above the Snarls and Banter of the
Play-house, or its Advocates: As for his Scost that
this is the only instance of Seizure of that kind,
amongst all the Millions of Christians, who since
that day have frequented the Play-house; Its of
a piece with the rest. I have prov'd that the
Devil, though he be the God of this World, is far
from being absolute, his Reign is consm'd to the
Children of Disobedience, and those he leads
Captive a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> his own Will; so that his Seizures
of this kind, consists of infinite numbers, though
his Seizures of the other sort be restrain'd to a few:
And by the concurring Testimonies of the Fathers,
Councils, and best of Christians in all Ages, as
has been already made out: He triumphs no
where more visibly, than upon the Stage; This I
have prov'd by the Confession of the two Penitent
Play-Poets above mentioned, but that in the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:98165:75"/>
Mouth of two or three Witnesses every thing
may be establish'd: I shall add that of an Actor,
who dying at the <hi>Bath</hi> about 1630. sent for his
Son, whom he had bred up to that same way of
Living. <hi>and abjured him with his last Breath, and
floods of Tears, that as he tendred the eternal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his Soul, he should abjure and for sake <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

            <p>If our Author consider it, he will soon be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced,
that the Seizure of the Soul is incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
more dreadful, than that of the Body; and
of this, I shall put him in Mind of one Instance
that was frightful enough, as it is recorded by
Mr. <hi>Braithwait,</hi> who was present and saw it<note n="†" place="margin">His Eng. Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in 1631 p. 53, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>An English Gentlewoman of good Note, who dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
spent the best of her time upon the Stage, falling
into a dangerous Sickness, her Friends sent for a
Minister to prepare her for her End; but whilst he
exhorted her to Repent, and to call upon God for
Mercy, instead of listning to his wholsome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions,
she redoubled her Cries, to let her see
<hi>Hieronimo</hi> acted, and as she had liv'd so she died.</p>
            <p>Now I would refer it to our Authors own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
whether he would be willing to make
such an <hi>Exit.</hi> And if this was not a more dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Possession, than those mentioned in the Gospel,
when the Devil threw the Bodies of those he had
made a Scizure of, into the Fire or Water. But
to conclude this point, I must crave leave to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
him, that the Devil hath renewed his claim
to the Stage, oftner than once since the days of
<hi>Tertullian,</hi> and particularly in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi>
Reign; when he visibly appeared on it, in the
<hi>Bell-Savage</hi> Play-house, as they were prophanely
acting, the Story of <hi>Faustus,</hi> to the Terror and

Temple doors in his Reign, universally opened
those of the Play-houses;—and so they
continued throughout the Empire many Reigns
after him.</p>
            </q>
            <p>If any Man should say, that when our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
was born, the Devil and the World kept
Holy Day for Joy, he would be foully mistaken,
and yet according to this Author, it would seem
they did so; <q>For at our Saviours Birth (<hi>says he</hi>)
Play-houses were open'd throughout the whole
Empire.</q> But what if I should tell him, that
the Devil, finding himself disarm'd by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours
Birth, and bereft of the Sword which he
had influenced Men to sheath in one anothers
Bowels for a long time, betook himself to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Weapon, and that was the Lusts of the
Flesh, to make War upon their Souls.</p>
            <p>This Speculation may not perhaps be so curl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
as that of our Author; but I am of Opinion
it may be every whit as solid; seeing not only
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:98165:76"/>
the Antient Fathers, but even the Heathen Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Historians, charge the Play-houses with all
Manner of Lewdness, and <hi>Augustus</hi> himself (as
I have already said) banished the Stage-Players
out of <hi>Rome</hi> because of the Mischiefs they oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned.</p>
            <p>The Reviewor must not pretend that the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Theatre was an Effect of our Saviour's
Birth, or a suitable way of Rojoycing for it; his

Doctrine, and prepared the Jews to receive him
by Repentance and Mortification.</p>
            <p>When our Saviour came himself <hi>at the fulness
of time</hi> the way of his Entrance into the World,
was the severest Reproof that ever was giv'n to
the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mps and Vanities of it. His Childhood

               </gap>othy Diversions, and when he entred on the

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e and refined Purity,
that was absolutely inconsistent with the Practice
of the Stage. He instructed his Followers in the
full Extent of the Law, that it did not so much
as allow a Wanton Glance or a Lewd Thought,
than which there cannot be a more effectual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
of the Theatre, which by the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of all Historians and Ages, has ever been
a Nursery of Impurity, and chiefly supported by
Persons of a dissolute Life.</p>
            <p>But to return to our Author.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Now it may raise a little Wonder (says he)
why the Apostles that went forth by a Special
Command of the Almighty, to Convertall Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Preaching Repentance and the Kingdom
of Heaven, they that so exactly performed that
great Commission as to arraign and censure Vice
and Impiety from the highest to the lowest, in
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:98165:77"/>
all its several Branches, not only pronounced
their louder <hi>Anathema's</hi> against the more crying
Sins, but read Divinity Lectures ev'n upon the
Wardrobe and Dressing Box, correcting the very
Indecencies of the Hair, the Apparel, and each
uncomly Gesture, that these Missioners of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
should travel through so many Heathen
Nations (the Gentiles they were sent to call) and
meet at every turn the Theatre, and the Stage.
Players staring them in the very Face, and not
make one Reprimand against them, is a Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
of very serious Reflection.</p>
               <p>Had the Play-house been as St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> calls
it, <hi>The Seat of Infection;</hi> or as <hi>Clemens Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrinus,</hi>
much to the same Sense calls it, <hi>The
chair of Pestilence;</hi> and to join the Authority
of the Unclean Spirit along with them, <hi>The
Devil's own Ground:</hi> I am of Opinion in this
case, that those Divine Monitors the Apostles
that set Bars to the Eye, the Ear, the Tongue,
to every smallest Avenue that might let in the
Tempter, would hardly have left the broad
Gates to the Play-house so open, without one
Warning to the unwary Christian in so direct a
Road to Perdition. Such a Discovery I believe
would have been rather the Earlier Cautionary
Favour of some of our kind Evangelical Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,
than the Extorted Confession of our grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
Infernal Enemy 200 Years after.</p>
            </q>
            <p>To Answer the Reviever in his own way of
Argument.</p>
            <p>Had the Stage been so useful to the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Mankind, to Government and to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
as Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi> pretends to prove it in his
late Book, or had it been such an Excellent
Mean for Recommending Vertue and Discoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancing
Vice, as others of its Advocates would
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:98165:77"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ve it to be, then certainly it may raise a little
wonder, that those kind Evangelical Guardians
should not have somewhere or other dropp'd one
Expression at least in its favour, as well as they
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> made use of the pertinent Expressions of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>me of the Poets; and therefore their profound
Evangelical Silence upon this Head, gives us just
cause to suspect that they had a far other Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the Design and Nature of the Theatre.</p>
            <p>But to come closer to our Author; had he but
seriously reflected upon his own Matter of serious
Reflection, it would soon have abated the height
of his Wonder; for if the Apostles Preached Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>

censur'd Vice and Impiety from the
highest to the lowest, read Divinity Lectures up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Ward-Robe and Dressing-Box, corrected the
Indecencies of the Hair and Apparel, and each un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comly
Gesture, they must by necessary conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
have Preached against the Stage, which is
charg'd with the height of Impiety and Vice, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous
prodigality of Apparel, unlawful dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guising
of the Sex, and obscene and uncomly po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures,
not only by the Fathers of the Church, but
even by <hi>Ovid, Iuvenal, Horace,</hi> and other Heathen
Poets and Historians of those times, as I have
proved before; so that our Reviewers Battery is
fairly dismounted, and his Cannon pointed against
himself: for by a Conclusion lawfully deduced
from his own Premises, it infallibly appears that
the Apostles did not only give one, but many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primands
to the Theatre, tho' they did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
it by name.</p>
            <p>And I will make bold to tell him further, that
the Apostles in those very Injunctions by which
they set Bars to the Eye, the Ear, and the Tongue,
did as infallibly shut up all the Avenues of the
Theatre, as they barricado'd those that might let
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:98165:78"/>
in the Tempter, if beholding Vanity, hearing
Blasphemy, and speaking Lies in hypocrisie come
within the reach of their Inspir'd Prohibitions.
And therefore well might St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> say, that
the Divine Wisdom would have had a low Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of Christians, had it descended to be more
particular in this Case; when the Stage was
known to abound with Idolatry, Profanity, Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Blasphemy, Sodomy, and such other Impur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
as were not so much as once to be named
amongst Christians.</p>
            <p>I pass over his Remarks on the Inconsistency
betwixt Mr. <hi>Colliers</hi> Defence of the Modesty
and Chastity of the Antient Heathen Poets and
Stage, and his quotations of the Fathers that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the contrary. Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> is able to defend
himself, and an Over-match for him on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
There's no doubt, but the Stage at its first
Institution, was chaster than ours, and if we may
give credit to <hi>Livy;</hi> The Plays at first, were plain
Country-Dances, where the Youth jok'd upon one
another in Artless Verse, and their Gestures were
as plain and simple as the rest of the performance.
The Poets that Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> quoted are modester
than ours, and yet it will not follow that the
horrid Impieties charg'd upon the Stage by the
Christian Fathers and Roman Historians, is all
slander; or that the Innocence of the Primitive
Stage was the cause of the Scriptural silence
against Plays.</p>
            <p>The Theatre was opposed by the Jews before
the Coming of Christ; tho' no where condemned
by name in the Old Testament: Yet that People
to whom the Oracles of God were committed,
understood it to be contrary to the Law of
<hi>Moses,</hi> and the Discipline of their Nation; and
therefore they conspir'd to cut off <hi>Herod</hi> the Great
in the Theatre which he had built at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:98165:78"/>
whilst he was beholding his Stage-Plays<note n="*" place="margin">Iosephus Antiq. Iud lib. 15. c. 11.</note>, which
they had certainly effected, had not the Plot been
discovered, whereof <hi>Herod</hi> taking the advantage
<hi rend="margQuotes">he brought in his Theatrical Enterludes, which
at first were pleasing to none but the Heathens
that sojourned there, and were at last attended
with an Apostacy from the Laws of their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s,
a corruption of Discipline, and dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Manners. And a remarkable Judgment
followed on <hi>Herod Agrippa,</hi> who appearing on
the Stage in a Silver Robe of admirable workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and being receiv'd by the Acclamations of
the People as a God, because of the beams which
darted from his Apparel by the Reflexion of the
Sun, was immediately smitten with a grievous
Disease by something that appeared in the shape
of an Owl hovering over his head; and being
tormented for five days with an intollerable
pain in his Bowels, was at last miserably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
by Worms.</hi> From this opposition of the
jews to the Stage, we may reasonably infer, that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> such method of pastime or diversion, or of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending
Virtue, and discouraging Vice, was
allowed by the Church of God under the Old
Testament, and that therefore there's much less
reason to think that any such thing was allowed
or approved by the Christian Church under the
New Testament, whose Worship has less of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Pomp, but much more of the Spirit and
Truth than that of the Jews had.</p>
            <p>From hence likewise we gain another Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that if the Jews thought the Stage dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd
under the General Prohibition, <hi>To take
the Names of the Heathen Gods in their mouths,</hi>
and the Article of their Law which <hi>forbad Men
and Women the promiscuous use of one anothers
Apparel,</hi> the Primitive Church had much greater
Reason to conclude that the Theatre was forbid
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:98165:79"/>
to them under the General Terms of <hi>Idolatry, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
of Idols, Vanities of the Gentiles, Rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Customs of the World, corrupt Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,
Bitterness and Evil Speaking, keeping
company with Fornicators, fellowship with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful
Works of Darkness, Filthiness, Foolish
Talking and Iesting which was not convenient, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
partakers with the Children of Disobedience,
Rioting, Chambering and Wantonness,</hi> &amp;c. all which
the Stage was infected with, as hath been prov'd
already. So that the Advocates of the Play-house
may with as much reason infer, that <hi>Apostacy,
Atheism, Incest</hi> and other Crimes are not forbidden
by the Scriptures, because not expresly nam'd
there, as argue that the Play-house is not
discharg'd because it is not particularly mention'd
in Sacred Writ.</p>
            <p>If it be objected, That all those Arguments
are against the Corruption of the Stage, but not
against the Original innocent Constitution of
Plays<note n="*" place="margin">Defence of Drama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Poetry. p. 54.</note>. I answer, that there never was a time,
when the Stage was free from all or part of those
Corruptions, that it was of an Heathenish and
Diabolical Institution, as has been already proved—That
at the very first, if we may cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
<hi>Livy</hi> in the place before quoted, the Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Stage consisted in Revelling, Dancing
and Foolish Jesting, and gradually grew worse
and worse, and tho' the Romans had Censors to
restrain its Abuses, and the Greeks admired and
promoted it at first, yet both those Wise Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
found themselves under a necessity of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
it at last: And I have already shew'd that
the Ends for which the best of its Patrons pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
it was Erected, are better provided for by
the Almighty; and therefore we cannot pretend
any necessity for it, except we reflect on his Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Power.</p>

will not bear his Conclusion, and that he
might with as much strength of Reason argue,
that the Apostle did not censure the Idolatry of
the Ephesians, because he quoted the Inscription on
one of their Altars <hi>TO THE UNKNOWN
GOD,</hi> and thence took occasion to instruct them
in the Knowledge of the true God, who alone
was Incomprehensible. Can any Man, tho' but

Therefore he did not censure the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

I have quoted his Arguments, and turn'd
them against himself, as the Apostle turn'd the

               </gap>ions of the Heathen Poets, against those

            <p>Of the same Nature is his Inference, <hi>That because

and lewd Theology? Out Author's Argument
will conclude as strongly for this, as for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the Stage.</p>
            <p>He comes next to Enquire into the Reason of
this over-violent Zeal of the primitive Fathers
against the Stage, which he finds to <hi>be the unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness
of it, because it was then a time of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution,

herded with their Persecutors and Murderers</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">p. 57, 58.</note>.</p>
            <p>The Falshood of this will appear from the
Quotations of the Fathers themselves under that
Head: These are some of their Reasons, but not
all, they laid the Stage under a perpetual Interdict
by Arguments naturally deduc'd from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
The Christian Councils condemn'd them
for the same Cause, and the first Christian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
condemn'd them by their Imperial Laws,
upon that same Account, as has been already
said; so that our Author discovers his want of
Reading or something that's better, when he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts
the contrary<note n="*" place="margin">From page 59, to 67.</note>.</p>
            <p>I shall conclude this Head with the Opinion of
the Reverend, Learned and Pious Mr. <hi>Richard
Baxter,</hi> as to the Stage and Reading of Plays
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:98165:80"/>
and Romances, as I find it in his <hi>Christian Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory:</hi>
Thus,</p>
            <q>
               <p>I think I never knew or heard of a Lawful-Stage
Play, Comedy or Tragedy in the Age that
I have liv'd in, and that those now commonly
used are not only Sins, but heinous aggravated
Sins; for these Reasons, I. They personate odious
Vices commonly Vitiously, that is, 1. Without
need reciting sinful Words, and representing
sinful Actions, which as they were Evil in the
first committing, so they are in the needless Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition,
<hi>Eph. 5. 3, 12. But Fornication and all
Uncleanness or Covetousness (or Lust) let it not
be once named among you, as becometh Saints;
neither Filthiness nor foolish Talking nor Iesting,
which are not convenient, but rather giving of
Thanks.—For it is a shame even to speak of
those things which are done of them in Secret.</hi>
2. Because they are spoken and acted common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
without that Shame, and Hatred, and Grief
which should rightly affect the Hearers with
an Abhorrence of them, and therefore tend to
reco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cile Men to sin, and to tempt them to take
it but for a matter of Sport. II. There are
usually so many Words materially false (tho'
not proper Lies) used in such Actings of Good
and Evil, as is unsavoury, and tendeth to tempt
Men to Fiction and false speaking. III. There
are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> usually such multitudes of vain Words pour'd
out on the Circumstantials as are a sin themselves,
and tempt the Hearers to the like. IV. They
usually mix such amorous or other such ensnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Expressions or Actions as are fitted to kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
Men's sinful Lusts, and to be Temptations to
the Evils which they pretend to cure. V. A great
deal of precious Time is wasted in them, which
might have been much better spent, to all the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:98165:81"/>
lawful Ends which they can intend. VI. It is
the preferring of an unmeet and dangerous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation,
before many fitter; God having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
us so great a choice of better, it cannot
be lawful to choose a worse. The Body which
most needeth Exercise with most of the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
hath no exercise at all, and the mind might
be much more fruitfully Recreated many ways
by variety of Books or Converse, by contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating
God and his Works, by the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughts
of the heavenly Glory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that it
is unlawful as unfitted to its pretended Ends.
VII. It's usually best suited with the most carnal
Minds and more corrupteth the Affections and
Passions, as full Experience proveth. Those that
most love and use them, are not reformed by
them; but commonly are the most loose, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly,
sensual People. VIII. The best and
wisest Persons least relish them, and are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
most against them; and they are best
able to make Experiment, what doth most help
or hurt the Soul. Therefore when the sensual

of a dying Man, to remember the time he had
spent at Stage-Plays. IX. Usually there is much
cost bestowed on them, which might be better
employed, and therefore is unlawful. X. God
hath appointed a stated means of instructing
Souls by Parents, Ministers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is much
more fit and powerful. Therefore that time
were better spent; and it is doubtful whether
Play-houses be not a stated means of Man's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

I cannot defend them, if any shall say that the
Devil hath apishly made these his Churches in
Competition with the Churches of Christ. XI. It
seemeth to me a heinous Sin for Players to live
upon this as a Trade and Function, and to be
educated for it, and maintained in it; that which
might be used as a Recreation, may not always
be made a Trade of. XII. There is no mention
that ever such Plays were used in Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
by any godly Persons. XIII. The Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Christians and Churches were commonly
against them: Many Canons are yet to be seen
by which they did condemn them. [Read but

Stage-plays were not the last or least of the
Temptations, which did over-throw them.
XV. The best that can be said of these Plays
is, that they are controverted and of doubtful
Lawfulness; but there are other means enough
of undoubtful and uncontroverted Lawfulness,
for the same honest ends; and therefore it is a
sin to do that which is doubtful without need.
Upon all these Reasons, I advise all that love
their Time, their Souls, their God and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,

                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:98165:82"/>As for Play-Books, and Romances, and Idle
Tales, I have already shewed in my Book of
Self-denial, how pernicious they are, especially
to Youth, and to frothy empty idle Wits, that
know not what a Man is, not what he hath to
do in the World; they are powerful Baits of the
Devil, to keep more necessary things out of their
minds, and better Books out of their hands, and
to poison the mind so much the more dangerous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as they are read with more delight and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and to fill the minds of sensual people
with such idle fumes and intoxicating fancies, as
may divert them from the serious thoughts of
their Salvation, and (which is no small loss) to
Rob them of abundance of that precious time
which was given them for more important busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and which they will wish and wish again
at last, that they had spent more wisely. I know
the Fantastick will say, that these things are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,
and may teach men much good (like
him that must go to a Whore-house to learn to
hate Uncleanness, and him that would go out
with Robbers to learn to hate Thievery.) But I
shall now only ask them, as in the presence of
God, 1. Whether they could spend that time no
better? 2. Whether better Books and Practices
would not edisie them more? 3. Whether the
greatest Lovers of Romances and Plays he the
greatest Lovers of the Book of God, and of a
holy Life? 4. Whether they feel in themselves
that the Love of these Vanities doth increase
their Love to the Word of God, and kill their
sin, and prepare them for the Life to come, or
clean contrary? And I would desire men not to
prate against their own Experience and Reason,

of those Times on the other side, there's few Men
of Sense would have thought themselves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
in the Reflection; but as it is levell'd
against all the Clergy without distinction, he must
give me leave to tell him that it may easily be
prov'd, that <hi>Sibthorp,</hi> and <hi>Manwaring,</hi> and the rest
of their passive Obedience-Doctors, who taught,
<hi>That the King was above Law, and might dispose
of our Estates Lives and Liberties, without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of Parliament,</hi> were the chief Fire-brands of
the Rebellion, and set the two Constituent parts
of our Government [the King and Parliament]
together by the Ears: And were by consequence
chargeable with the Reveries of <hi>Hugh Peters</hi> and
the rest of the Enthusiastical Tribe, who carried
things to the other Extream, when the People
were render'd Mad by Oppression. But as for the
Body of the English Clergy, either Episcopal or
Presbyterian, the Charge is Malicious and Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.
The best of the Church of <hi>England</hi> Clergy
opposed the Stage in those times, as well as the
Presbyterians, yet it's known that both of them
oppos'd the carrying on of things to that height
which they afterwards came to. And I must beg
leave to tell him that his Brethren of the Stage
by usurping upon the Sabbath, and ridiculing the
Pretensions of the People to their Liberty and
Property had no small share in bringing on the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities
he speaks of. Or if he be for a later In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
I can oblige him with one that is still
fresh in Memory, <hi>Viz.</hi> That the Nonjurant Clergy
in this Reign, the Pupils or Followers of <hi>Sibthorp</hi>
and <hi>Manwaring</hi> in that of King <hi>Charles,</hi> were so
zealous for the lately intended French Invasion,
that no less than a Troop of them did offer their
Service to hallow the Rebellion, and some of
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:98165:83"/>
them did so little abhor the Assassinating of
Crown'd-Heads, that they absolv'd the Assassiens

to shew, that whatsoever our Author may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
his Reformation comes short of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

those very Fathers whom he and his Church of

               <head>Remarks on the Rape, or Innocent Impostors.</head>
               <p>In the next place I shall take notice of a Play,
intituled, <hi>The Rape, or Innocent Impostor,</hi> Printed
in 1692. And whereof I understand the Author is
a Clergy-man, of good Reputation, and therefore
am bound in Charity to think that he designed to
correct, and not to incourage Vice by his Play;
but as the Pulpit, and not the Stage was his busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
he was out of his Road when he meddled
with Plays; and tho' it be more modest and
chast than that call'd <hi>Beauty in Distress,</hi> yet I
dare refer it to his own serious thoughts, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Genselarius</hi> premediated Rape upon <hi>Eurione,</hi>
his glorying in it after the commission of the foul
Crime, and insisting so much upon the satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
he had in it, even to the last moment when
he was to die for it, be agreeable to the strict
Rules of Modesty; or whether it has not rather a
tendency to incourage Lustful Youth to dangerous
attempts. Nor is <hi>Euriones</hi> practice, who kill'd
her self after the Rape, to be propos'd as a Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
in such cases. Our Author knows that the
Fathers disallowed of all such Representations,
that they looked upon them to be contrary to the
Scriptures, which methinks should have hindred
him from employing himself that way, and so
much the more, that he knows the mischief that
hath been done to our Morals and Religion by
the Theatre, and that others might be influenc'd
to take a greater Liberty by his Example.</p>
               <p>We need go no further for an instance than
Mr. <hi>Durfey,</hi> in his Comedy call'd, <hi>The Campaign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi>
who values himself so much upon his <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
with several eminent Men of the

prove his good Behaviour,</hi> that he thinks it suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent

Of such mischievous Consequences is it for

Ministry Ridiculous; and therefore it's but just
that such of the Clergy as have been pleased
with injurious Reflections upon their Brethren
[the Dissenters] should come in their turn to feel
the Lash.</p>
               <p>It is not to be denied but the Clergy have
their Faults as well as others; and so had the
blessed Apostles, who own that the <hi>Treasure of
the Gospel is committed to Earthen Vessels</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. ver. 7.</note>. And
that they had their Humane Frailties like other
Men; but it would scarcely be allowed in any
Christian State, that the Theatre should make
sport with <hi>Peter's Swearing and Denying his
Master,</hi> Paul'<hi>s Thorn in the Flesh, or</hi> Barnabas'<hi>s
Dissention.</hi> Nor by parity of Reason ought it
to be allow'd, that the Ministers of the Gospel,
should be so treated now, for tho' they have not
the same Power with the Apostles, nor their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions
to infallibility in Doctrine, yet their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sice

               <p>I come next to View the <hi>Campaigners,</hi> a Comedy

himself above Reformation.</p>
               <p>I am no way concern'd to take notice of his
Preface upon Mr. <hi>Collier,</hi> because I find nothing
of Argument in it, but meerly Recrimination,
which is nothing at all to the purpose. But this
I am sure of, that Mr. <hi>Dursey</hi>'s Comedy could
have as little good Influence upon the Morals of
his Audience, as Mr. <hi>Collier</hi>'s Books can have upon

in his first Act, can have no other tendency,
but to harden such Fellows in their Impiety and to
teach them the Art of Drunkenness, Filching and
Playing the Pimp.</p>
               <p>His Conference betwixt <hi>Dorange</hi> and <hi>Kinglove</hi>
is adapted to nothing else but to nourish Vice, and
to teach the Method of Debauching Ladies; and
how they on the other hand, may carry on their
Intreagues with their Gallants. There's no doubt
but Mr. <hi>Durfey</hi> blesses himself for the happiness
of his Invention in making <hi>Kinglove</hi> say, <hi>That an

               <p>His Letter too, is a Noble Exemplar for his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies

no doubt of the Happiness of a Married

so much for his Benevolence, yet so fat was she,
and so incapable of Childing, that an Irishman

               <p>Annikys <hi>accusing her Husband of Frigidity, and

an admirable Pattern of a Good Natur'd Wittal.
Well, let's go on to the Conclusion of <hi>Thomas</hi>'s
supersine Answer <hi>Gadsbores</hi> (says he) <hi>I fancy we
Lie always like two Udders in a Dish without ere
a Tongue.</hi> This is an admirable proof of the
Modesty of the English Stage; and enough to

answers; But if he were to feed upon't ten and
twenty Years, as 'tis the case of us miserable
Husbands, he would be glad to change it for
the Haunch of a Horse.</hi> This is admirable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
for Married Persons to frequent the
Theatre, where they may have such excellent
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:98165:89"/>
Lessons of Conjugal Affection and Chastity. These
are the Curious Representations that edifie our
Beaus more than the best Sermons, and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
so much to the happiness of Mankind.</p>
               <p>But to conclude this Noble Lecture of Chastity,
<hi rend="margQuotes">
                     <hi>Thomas</hi> tells her, that she's a gross Barren Hen,
that is so rank fed, she's uncapable of Breed, and
yet so greedy on't, that she's eternally Cackling,
that he would Lock her up over the Stable,
where she should have Heirs, and the great Gib
Catt there should Father them; and she tells
him, that she Roosts among Cravens that have
got the Pip:</hi> If Cocks were good, Hens would
have Chickens. Now I leave it to the Reader that
has any sense of Religion to judge, whether the
Evil Spirit of Uncleanness himself could express
things in a more fulsom and undecent manner;
yet these are the Men, and those are their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
<hi>that are to recommend Virtue and discourage
Vice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am come next to his <hi>Nurses Song,</hi> Scene II,
which with his <hi>Scotch Song,</hi> and his <hi>Reformation
Song,</hi> will help to Compose a Psalter for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil's
Church, as the Fathers call the Play-house.
The first Song is an admirable Lesson of Chastity,
fit to be sung to Mr. <hi>Durfy</hi>'s Lyre, and may vye
for Modesty with any that's to be found in <hi>Ovid</hi>
or <hi>Martial.</hi> It's a delicate Sonnet for Nurses to
sing to their Young ones, that they may suck in
Virtue like Mother's Milk, and must needs tend
highly to the Edification of the Sisters and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in their <hi>Teens,</hi> when they take a step into
the Nursery to see and divert themselves with
their Infant Brothers or Sisters. It must needs
leave a Chast Impression upon them to hear
Nurse tune out these Modest Lines.</p>
               <l>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:98165:89"/>And when in due season my <hi>Billy</hi> shall wed,</l>

               <l>When <hi>Billy</hi> comes near her to kiss, kiss, kiss.</l>
               <p>They that would have their Nurses taught to
<hi>sing</hi> Vertuous Songs, had best send them to Mr.
<hi>Durfey,</hi> who can furnish them with admirable
Samplars.</p>
               <p>But to proceed; That our Author may make
his Comedy all of a piece. His Fable of <hi>Doranges</hi>
getting into <hi>Angelica</hi>'s Bed in a Woman's Dress,
includes a very good Lesson for instructing a wild
extravagant Beau, how to debauch and steal a
Fortune. Such a Representation as this cannot
fail of raising very Chast Passions among the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
and the other part of the Fable endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to match her with <hi>Bondevelt</hi> under the
notion of a pure Virgin, contains an excellent
Pattern of Moral Honesty, and teaches an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue
of special use for imitation.</p>
               <p>Then again in the third Scene we have a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
Character of the English Gentry, <hi>That
their Right business is nothing but pleasure,</hi> and
that I suppose is frequenting the Stage; for there,
says Mr. <hi>Dennis,</hi> is the greatest pleasure. But if
this be the true Character of the English Gentry,
how comes it to pass, that so many of them have
rais'd Vast Fortunes by application to Law, Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,
Divinity and Merchandice?</p>
               <p>I shall meddle no further with this Lewd Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,
nor can what I have done already, be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by any other Argument; but that it's sit the
World should see what an useful thing the Stage
is for Reformation of Manners.</p>

            <l>But the Stage pleases Men,</l>
            <l>Ergo.</l>
            <p>The Falshood of the first Proposition is so
manifest from the Experience of all Men, that I
cannot but wonder at our Author's Confidence to
advance it. The Libertine is pleased with his
Paramour, and yet is so far from being happy in
his Pleasure that it wastes his Conscience, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes
his Body and ruines his Estate. The Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:98165:90"/>
is pleased with his Bottle, yet is so far from
being happy in it, that it has the same dismal ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
upon him, as Uncleaness has upon the
Wanton.—The Glutton is pleased with
his costly Cates and riotous Banquets, but is so
far from being happy in his Pleasure, that he En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tails
Diseases upon himself and diggs his Grave
with his own Teeth.—The Miser is pleased
with his Baggs, yet is so far from being happy in
them, that he is eat up with carking cares how to
preserve them, or to lay them out to the best ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
            <p>To prove this Argument Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi> says,
<hi rend="margQuotes">That by Happiness he could never understand
any thing but Pleasure, and that he could never
possibly conceive how any one can be happy
without being pleased, or pleased without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
happy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let him but take a turn to <hi>Bedlam,</hi> and there
he may have convincing Instances of poor
Wretches being extreamly pleased with their
foolish Conceits, that are far from being happy; or
let him visit some of his Friends in a raging Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and perhaps he may hear them express a great
deal of Pleasure and Delight in many things, and
yet poor Creatures fall much short of being hapy.</p>
            <p>His own Assertion [p. 8.] <hi>That a Man cannot be
happy without or against Reason,</hi> perfectly destroys
his Proposition, for in all the Cases above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
those Persons are pleased both without
and against Reason, which plainly proves that it
is not pleasure, but a Rational Pleasure or none at
all that makes a Man happy, otherwise the Brute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beasts,
are more happy than the happiest of
Men.</p>
            <p>So that if this be granted, which no reasonable
Man or good Christian can deny, that our Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
ought to be ruled by Reason, his Argument
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:98165:91"/>
will prove but a feeble Support to the Stage
it being highly unreasonable to take pleasure in
that which is not only needless, to the ends for
which it is pretended, there being other meansap
pointed for that, as I have prov'd already, but comes
so far short of them, that by the concurring Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of all Ages, it is condemned for produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the contrary Effects.</p>
            <p>To set this matter in a Clearer Light, let us
take a View of those Pleasures which are to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
reap'd from the Stage; Spiritual Pleasures they
are not, for Divinity and Religion are seldom or
never mentioned there, but in order to be ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cul'd:
Rational Pleasures they cannot be, seeing
it is contrary to Reason for Mankind to please
themselves with the Representations of Rapes,
Murders, and all manner of Villanies, which is
the principal part of the Entertainment; the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
allotted them take up the least part
of the time, for most of that is spent in represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Intrigues that the Personal Dramatis carry
on for obtaining their lwed Ends, and the pleasure
they take in the Enjoyment of their desires, and
the Impression of the Tragical Catastrophe is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
defac'd by some Comical Conclusion at
last. So that upon the whole the Pleasures that
are reap'd from the Stage must needs be sensual;
and if wallowing in them conduce any thing to
the happiness of Mankind, then Reason and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
too have put a horrid Cheat upon us, ought
to be banished out of the World, and the only
Deity we are to invoke is some <hi>Circe</hi> or other
to transform us into Dogs and Swine, that we
may be compleatly happy. For Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi> says
(page 6 and 7.) <hi>The Philosophers were Fools to
ascribe their Happiness to Reason, for that may of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
afflict us, &amp; make us miserable, is an impediment
to our pleasure, and nothing but Passion can please
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:98165:91"/>
us.</hi> The natural consequence of which must be
that none but Beasts, Fools and Mad-men are
happy in this World.</p>
            <p>He tell us, page 8. <hi>That it's plain that the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
both of this Life and the other, is owing to
Passion, and not to Reason;</hi> so that he must be
the only happy man here that wallows in his
pleasures, and indulges his passions. And in the
other World he informs us, <hi>we shall be delivered
from those Mortal Organs, and Reason shall then
be no more: We shall lead the Glorious Life of
Angels, a Life exalted above all Reason, a Life
consisting of Extasie and Intelligence.</hi> If this be
not a Rhapsody of downright contradictions, there
can be no such thing as a contradictions, there
can be no such thing as a contradiction in nature;
a <hi>Rational Soul without Reason; Understanding
without Reason;</hi> and <hi>Reason dying with Mortal
Organs.</hi> Nay, there's another Position in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of the 7th page as extraordinary as any of
those, and that is, <hi>That the very height and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of pleasure which we are promised in another
Life, must, we are told, proceed from Passion, or
somthing that resembles Passion; at least no man
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> so much as pretended that it will be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
of Reason.</hi> Who it is that has told our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
thus, he would do well to inform us; for I
believe this Revelation is peculiar to himself.
The Scriptures do indeed say, <hi>That in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the Lord there is fulness of Ioy, and at
his Right hand there are Pleasures for evermore</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">Psa. 16. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but are so far from hinting at any thing like Joy
without Reason, that the Works of Creation, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
and Providence and the Beatifical Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of God in his perfections, seem to be plainly
reveal'd, to be the Reason of all the <hi>Hallelujahs</hi>
and Raptures of Praise and Joy which the Saints
shall Eccho forth in Heaven to all Eternity. <hi>Abr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

is represented to us in Heaven <hi>with the use of
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:98165:92"/>
his Reason, and arguing with</hi> Dives. We are told
that there is Joy in Heaven, <hi>by reason</hi> of <hi>the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
of Sinners;</hi> there's no doubt that those
Extasies of Joy are above what our Reason is now
able to comprehend, but that Reason and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion
should there cease, there's not the least
ground to imagine. Our Author owns, that <hi>we
shall lead the Glorious Life of Angels,</hi> as to
whom it is plain from the Scriptures, that they
are reasonable Beings, they make use of their
Reason to pry into the Mystery of Redemption,
and sung Songs of Praise at our Saviour's Birth;
for this very Reason, that God had manifested <hi>Peace
upon the Earth and Good-will towards Men;</hi> from
all which it's plain, that our Happiness in Heaven
will not proceed from Passion, but from our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted
Enjoyment of God, the Reflection
upon which with our Reason will occasion eternal
and unspeakable joy.</p>
            <p>This I conceive will appear yet more plain from
the following Consideration, <hi>viz.</hi> That a Man
cannot be happy except he know himself to be so,
and if we have not the use of our Reason and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection,
we can never know that we are happy,
nor be sensible of the Dangers we have escaped;
so that for Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi>'s Heaven we had as good
be reduced to our <hi>first nothing</hi> as to enjoy it,
seeing, according to his Notion, we must there
be depriv'd of the Faculty of reflecting upon our
past Dangers and present Enjoyments, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
afford a Rational Soul so much Delight, as it
may have in a pleasant Dream.</p>
            <p>I shall only add, That to conceive a humane
Soul without <hi>Reason</hi> after death, is to suppose
the very Essence of it annihilated, which is a
fair step towards denying the <hi>Resurrection</hi> and the
<hi>Eternity of Punishment and Reward;</hi> a Doctrine
fitted to the Pallate of the Libertines of the Age,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:98165:92"/>
the principal Rule of whose Faith and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
is,</p>

               </gap>;</l>
            <p>Or as the Scripture expresses it,</p>

               <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 32.</note>.</p>
            <p>If we have not the Exercise of Reason in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
we cannot Act Faith upon the promise of God
for the Eternity of our Happiness there, which
our Reason will tell us we may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>st assur'd of,
because <hi>he is the God of truth that cannot lie, and
with whom there is no variableness nor shaddow of
turning.</hi> Nor can our service, which is Songs of
Praise and Everlasting Delight in the Enjoyment
of his Presence be reasonable there, which will
make i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> less perfect than the Service that we are

               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1.</note>, nor without it can we
contemplate God the Author and Fountain of our
Happiness with Delight; for according to Mr.
<hi>Dennis</hi>'s Notion, there can be no dif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>erence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
those unconceiveable Transports of Joy
which the Blessed have in Heaven, and the Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of a Mad-man, who can give no reason for
what he does or what he says; and how this can
be acceptable Service to God, let any Man, that
has but the least Impression of Religion judge.—
Our Saviour tells us, <hi>That Mary lov'd much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
much was forgiven her;</hi> Is it then consistent
with reason, that we shall be fill'd with Raptures
of Love and Joy in Heaven, and not know the
reason of it there, as well as we know the reason of
our Love to the Almighty here on Earth; which is
his Pardoning Grace, thro' our blessed Redeemer,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:98165:93"/>But to return to Mr. <hi>D</hi>'s Argument, <hi>That 'tis
Pleasure only that makes a man happy:</hi> He is guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of a great omission in not explaining his terms,
and telling us what sort of Pleasure he means;
tho' to do him Justice there seems to be no great
need of it, when we consider that the Stage is the
Subject he treats of, whence those Pleasures are
to be reap'd; so that we cannot expect to reap
any other Pleasures but those of Sin from such an
unhallowed Soil.</p>
            <p>But allowing him, <hi>That a Moderate Pleasure
in our Lawful Enjoyments here is a happiness,</hi> and
a gracious Gift of God, as without doubt it is,
that will not prove that we ought to create our
selves feigned Objects of Pleasure, as all those
Theatrical Representations are, seeing God allows
us those that are real. Much less will it prove
that we ought to hunt after Pleasure, by having
our Passions rai'd; when there's no occasion o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
proper Object for them, for that in plain terms
is a perverting the use of 'em, and forcing them
beyond the Intent of Nature. God has endowed
us with Love, and Hatred, and inspired Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Creatures with a desire to propagate their
own kind in pursuance of that primitive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
that <hi>they should increase and multiply;</hi> but
at the same time he has confin'd that desire to
certain Limits, <hi>That every Man should have his
own Wife, and every Woman her own Husband;</hi>
whence 'tis evident, that it's unlawful for us to
frequent the Stage to have that Passion rais'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
we know not who, or to endanger its being
diverted from the Right Object. And as for Young
Persons who are unmarried, the Theatre is the
most improper place in the World to seek a
suitable Match in, and I believe seldom frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on that account. I am afraid <hi>Iuvenal</hi>'s Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
holds too true of the Modern Theatre.</p>

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
the raising of their Passions endangers their
Chastity.</p>
            <p>The like may be said of the other <hi>Passions,</hi> to
have our <hi>Anger and Indignation</hi> excited against
we know not who in a Tragedy, is far from the
Divine Precept, of <hi>being angry and sin not.</hi> It was
never the End for which God endowed us with
that Passion, to be angry at Wickedness in shew,
but at Wickedness in reality. The same Rule
serves for <hi>Pity</hi> and <hi>Compassion;</hi> we are to extend
that towards Men in real distress, and not to have
our Compassion excited towards a Chimerical ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
in a Theatre that needs it not. It will hold the
same as to <hi>Mirth and Delight;</hi> we are not to
make sport, or to take pleasure either in the sin
or misery of others; from all which it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
that we ought not to frequent the Stage for
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>citing our Passions: But admitting that the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of the Passions makes a man happy; by Mr.
<hi>Dennis</hi>'s own concession, <hi>P. 16.</hi> the frequenting
of the Stage is a very improper mean for it, for
there <hi>he owns, that the longer any man frequents
Plays, the harder he is to be mov'd;</hi> and therefore
we may very well conclude from his own Premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
that the seeing of so many unchast and
bloody Representations, is the ready way to take
off and dull that Horror which all men ought to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ntertain against the real practice of Uncleanness,
Cruelty, and the other Vices there represeated.
This may be likewise prov'd by a very familiar
Instance: Butchers, tho' but accustomed to the
killing of Beasts, have less horror generally for
Murder than other men; and Soldiers, who are
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:98165:94"/>
accustomed to behold Slaughter and Blood-shed,
are not generally so compassionate and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted
as those who never were in a Field.</p>
            <p>I must observe one thing by the way before I
go any further, <hi>viz.</hi> that Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi> and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of the <hi>Review</hi> contradict one another in this
matter. The <hi>Reviewer</hi> maintains against Mr. <hi>Collier,</hi>
that the Representations of the Stage, don't im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
the same Passions upon the Audience<note n="†" place="margin">p. 19. 67, &amp;c.</note>,
whereas Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi> asserts it, and thinks it the
Glory of the Theatre that it does so, seeing rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the Passions is the only way to make a man
happy. I must declare my Agreement with Mr.
<hi>Dennis</hi> as to the influence of those Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
upon the Spectators, but at the same time
must tell him, that the Iniquites there represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
especially irregular Amours, have so strong a
party in every man's corrupt Nature, that those
Lascivious Representations, Intrigues of Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and Amorous Speeches, have ten to one
odds against our Virtue, which taking in Religion
to its assistance, is often found too weak, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times foil'd by corrupt Nature, as appears by
the Instances of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> the holiest
and wisest of men, and therefore it is that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs
and punishments allotted to Vice by the
Stage, have never been able to obtain those Ends
which its Patrons pretend to, <hi>viz.</hi> the Incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Virtue, and discountenancing of Vice, but
hath always produc'd the contrary Effect.</p>
            <p>But to take a further View of Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi>'s
Notion, that we are made happy by Pleasures,
let's examine it a little by Sacred Writ. There we
find <hi>Solomon,</hi> who had made the largest Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of it, declaring, that all the Pleasures this
World can afford (even those refined ones of
<hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Knowledge</hi> not excepted) <hi>to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Vanity and Vexation of Spirit</hi>

            <p>Then seeing it is so, how can any Christian
indulge themselves in Passion, or Transports of
Pleasure in any sublunary Thing? How can they
allow themselves in those foolish Jests, filthy
Discourses, and immoderate Laughters that are
occasioned by Comedies; or in that Wrath, Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
Malice and Revenge which breath forth
every where in Tragedies? How can they that are

               </gap> to Mourn over their own Sins, and those of
others, laugh at the Follies and Lewdness of
Whoremongers represented on the Stage, or how
can they in Conscience take pleasure in the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations
of those things to the Eye in Publick,
that they ought to be ashamed to hear spoken of,
as committed in Secret? How dare they that are
commanded to work out their Salvation with fear
and Trembling, delight in such Wantonness, Jol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and Revelling? With what Conscience can
they that are commanded to redeem their time,
mispend it so unconscionably in the lew'd Theatre,
or with what Peace of Conscience can they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish
out Money in such needless Pleasures, when
so many of the poor Saints and Servants of
God are starving for want of Necessaries.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi> in the latter part of his first Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
seems to recant his Epicurean Lecture in the
rest of it, and tells us<note n="†" place="margin">Page 8.</note>, <hi>the</hi> Passions must be
rais'd in such manner as to take reason along with
them, which how he will reconcile to his former
Positions, <hi>that Reason often afflicts and makes us
miserable, hinders our</hi> Pleasures, and Combates
our Passions<note n="†" place="margin">Page 6.</note>, <hi>and that nothing but</hi> Passion in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
can please us, and nothing but Pleasure can
make us happy<note n="†" place="margin">Page 7.</note>. Let him see to it. Perhaps he
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:98165:95"/>
was exalted to his own Heaven, and wrote those
Contradictions when he was deliver'd from his
Mortal Organs, and his Reason had left him<note n="†" place="margin">Page 8.</note>.
And if it was so, he had as good have conceal'd
his Ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>atical Raptures, for any great Feats, they
are like to do in the World, they may perhaps
make Quakers; but sure I am they can never make
Christians: Aud thus I leave it to the Judicious
Reader to consider, whether he hath prov'd that
the Stage is Useful to the Happiness of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
            <p>In his Second Chapter he attempts to prove,
That the Stage is more particularly Instrumental
to the Happiness of Englishmen,—and the
Argument he makes use of is, <hi>That the English
are the most Splenetick People in Europe,</hi> of a
gloomy sullen Temper, uneasie to themselves and
dangerous to the Government. This is enough
in all Conscience to give them a fit of the Spleen,
were they never so good Natur'd; but to alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate
our Anger, he tells us, it's the fault of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<hi>the reigning Distemper of our Clime;</hi> and
to oblige us further, he directs us to the <hi>Drama,</hi>
as our Remedy.</p>
            <p>I am afraid our Author is neither a Traveller,
Historian nor Polititian, else he would scarcely
have v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ntur'd on such a Reflection: Let him but
waft himself over for a Month into <hi>Spain,</hi> and
take a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>urn through <hi>France</hi> into the Empire of
<hi>Germany,</hi> don't let him forget to take <hi>Holland</hi> in
his way Home; and then let him spend some
Weeks in turning over the Histories of those se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Countries, and I am much mistaken if he
don't find himself convinc'd by Experience and
Authority, that our Neighbours are as sullen and
morose as we, have been as uneasie to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and endanger'd their Governments as oft<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:98165:96"/>
and yet all of them have had the Enjoyment of
the <hi>Drama.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I must likewise beg leave to tell him, That the
good Nature of Englishmen has been for a long
time taken notice of, and that I have read it as
an Observation from as good an Author as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
that there's no other Language has a word
to express it.</p>
            <p>I must likewise desire him to give a Reason,
Why the Splenetick Temper of the Nation should
not make the Government as dangerous to the
People, as it renders the People dangerous to
the Government, seeing the Administration must
always be in the Hands of Englishmen; and I
would pray him if he can to give me an Instance
where he has read of a better Understanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Prince and People than there was betwixt
Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and her English Subjects; or if
he can parallel the Instance of the present Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
that any Monarch did ever venture to
leave his Dominions so frequently, and with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o
much Confidence and Security, as his present Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
has done, notwithstanding the Faction of a
dethron'd Prince in the midst of us, and a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Enemy at War with us abroad, at all times
ready to Encourage them to rebel: And then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
shall yield him the Point, That the English are
more Splenetick than their Neighbours.</p>
            <p>But now as to his Remedy [the Drama.]</p>
            <p>He tells us, <hi rend="margQuotes">That the Passions are seldom any
where so pleasing, and no where so safe as in
Tragedy</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Page 10.</note>. But seeing the Representations there
are generally contriv'd to represent the sudden
t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rns of Fate, the unhappy result of Violence &amp; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice,
and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> Intrigues carried on for the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
of Tyrants, I am afraid it will scarce be
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:98165:96"/>
proper for a Splenetick People: And thus we see
how well he has prov'd, That the Stage is more
particularly Instrumental to the Happiness of
English-men.</p>
            <p>In his third Chapter he pretends to answer the
Objections from Reason, and denies <hi>that the more
the Passions in any Man are mov'd, the more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
they are to be mov'd, and the more unruly
they grow</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">p. 16.</note>. This he says is contrary to common
Experience, <hi>because-the more any person frequents
Plays, the harder he is to be pleas'd and mov'd.</hi>
But by Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi>'s favour, his Answer is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to the purpose, or just no more than this,
<hi>that the longer a man eats Beef, the less he cares
for it:</hi> He knows the old saying, <hi>Iucundis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sima
Voluptas quam rarior usus commendat,</hi> a man
may be cloy'd with the greatest Dainties. But
can he deny that the more a Cholerick Man's Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
is mov'd, the more peevish and outragious
he grows; and the more the Letcher's Passion is
mov'd, the more lustful and brutish he grows, so
long as Nature will keep pace; or the more the
Miser's Avarice is mov'd, the more covetous he
grows, till his mouth is fill'd with dust. If he can
deny this, he is fit <hi>for his own Heaven, where his
Reason shall be no more</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">p. 8.</note>.</p>
            <p>In the next place he denies that <hi>Corruption of
Manners proceeded from the establishment of the
Drama upon the Restoration of K.</hi> Charles <hi>the 2d.</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st. Says he, <hi>Because we never heard any Complaint
of the like Corruption of Manners before the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storation
of K.</hi> Charles <hi>the II. tho' the Drama flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish'd
in the Reign of K.</hi> James <hi>I.</hi> as Mr. <hi>Collier</hi>
tells us, with the like Licentiousness<note n="†" place="margin">Page 19.</note>. By Mr.
<hi>Dennis</hi>'s leave here's a contradiction in Terms, a
<hi>Stage as licentious as ours at present, whose Abuses
he owns in the same page to be palpable, and yet
no Complaint of Corruption of Manners.</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:98165:97"/>
I will give him a better Authority than his
own, let him read Mr. <hi>Prin</hi>'s Histriomastix, and
there he will find Complaint enough before the
Restoration of K. <hi>Charles</hi> II. and sufficient cause
for it too.</p>
            <p>The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d Argument, <hi>That the Corruption of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
is greater in</hi> France, <hi>tho' their Theatres are
less licentious than ours,</hi> will stand him in little
stead; for supposing it true that the Manners
of the French are more corrupted than ours,
which I am afraid will scarcely be granted: tho'
their Theatres be less licentious, their Religion is
more, which allows them to be as wicked as the
Devil can make them, provided they have but
Money enough to pay for a Pardon, or fury
enough to persecute the Protestants. <hi>That the
Germans are greater Drinkers, and the Italians
more inclinable to Unnatural Lust, tho' they have
less of the Drama than we:</hi> Perhaps they will
charge the Cause upon Heaven as he does, and
impute it to their Clime; but can he say that if
they had more of the Drama, they would not be
more addicted to those Crimes than at present
they are. If he will give himself the trouble of
reading the Authorities I have formerly quoted,
he will find both those Crimes, and particularly
the latter charg'd upon the Stage: Nor can Mr.
<hi>Dennis</hi> assign any Reason why going from the
Theatre to the Tavern with a Miss, or other lewd
company, as is but too too common, should not
occasion Drunkenness and Sodomy both.</p>
            <p>His 3d Argument is<note n="†" place="margin">p. 20.</note>, <hi>That the Corruption of
Manners upon the Restoration appeared with all
the fury of Libertinism before the Play-house was
re-established.</hi> 
               <hi rend="margQuotes">And that the Cause of that Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
could be nothing but that beastly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
which in the time of the Late Civil
Wars, begun at the Tail instead of the Head
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:98165:97"/>
and Heart, and which oppressed and persecuted
Men's Inclinations, instead of correcting and
converting them, which afterwards broke out
with the same Violence that a Raging Fire does
upon its first getting Vent:</hi> And that which gave
it so liscentious a Vent, was not only the Permission
but the Example of the Court. Which having so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ'd
<hi rend="margQuotes">for a considerable time both at <hi>Paris</hi> and
in the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> united the Spirit of the
French Whoring to the fury of the Dutch
Drinking.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here's Civil Treatment to the Parliament of
<hi>England,</hi> a parcel <hi>of beastly reforming fellows, aad
a reforming Tail too.</hi> But by Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi>'s leave,
whoever's the Head, the Parliament is the Brains;
they have all the trouble of Contriving, and one
half, nay some say two thirds of the Authority of
Enacting Laws, and no small share in putting
them in Execution; so that for them to attempt
a Reformation when the Court would not, proves
them to have been the Men, and some body else
<hi>the Beast.</hi> But to pass that, I must intreat Mr.
<hi>Dennis</hi> to be merciful to his own Arguments, and
not always to cut their Throats with his own
Hands. For first, he tells us, <hi>That the Cause of
that Libertinism, was nothing but that beastly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</hi>
And then he informs us, that <hi>it was
permitted &amp; encouraged by the example of the Court,
who had united the Spirit of the French Whoring
to the fury of the Dutch Drinking;</hi> so that he is
resolv'd the Court and Parliament shall have it
betwixt them, and not a Farthing matter which,
so the Stage be but clear on't. And he hath also
oblig'd the World with a very important Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
that <hi>persecuting and oppressing of Liberti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism,
was the Cause of Corruption of Manners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But alas! the poor man in one of his heavenly
Extasies, <hi>when he was delivered from the Mortal
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:98165:98"/>
Organs of his Reason,</hi> turns Cat in Pan, plays
Sir <hi>Martin Marr-all,</hi> and falls foul upon his
Friends of the Stage; for in the very next words
he tells us, <hi>That the Poets who writ imm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>diately
after the Restoration, were obliged to humour the
deprav'd tastes of their Audience. For if the Poets
of those times had writ without any mixture of
Lewdness, the Appeties of the Audience were so
debauch'd, that they would have judged the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
insipid.</hi> So that here's a fair Confession,
that the Stage promoted and encourag'd the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of Manners. But then being sorry that
he has done his Friends this diskindness, he makes
them amends, and concludes this Paragraph thus,
That 'tis evident that the Corruption of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is so far from proceeding from the Play-house,
that it partly proceeds from having no Plays at all.</p>
            <q>
               <l>—Risum teneatis amici.</l>
            </q>
            <p>His fourth Argument is, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>That the Stage can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi rend="margQuotes">possibly encourage or encline Men to Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enness,
Gaming and Unnatural Sins, and that
the Love of Women is fomented by the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
and not by the Genuine Art of the
Stage</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">P. 25, 26.</note>.</p>
            <p>To prove this Argument, he alledges, That
Drunkards are always rendred Odious and Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
by the Stage, Gamsters are never shewn
there, but either as Fools or Rascals, and that of
those four Reigning Vices, the Stage only En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages
Love to Women, which is the least, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
least Contagious, and least Universal, and is a
Check upon the other three; and particularly
upon Unnatural Lust, which is the most destruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive
to the Happiness of Mankind<note n="*" place="margin">Page 25, 26, 27.</note>.</p>
            <p>I answer in the first place, that Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi>'s
Argument and his Topicks to prove it, are found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
meerly on his own Authority: and in the next
place, that here, as elsewhere he is guilty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions.
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:98165:98"/>
—<hi>The Stage</hi> (he says) <hi>does not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
the Corruption of Manners;</hi> and yet owns

            <p>But for a further Answer, I must tell him, that
those Sins have generally a Dependance, and are
mutually productive of one another; and the

Actors and Play-haunters were the greatest Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenters
of Taverns, Ale-houses, Brandy-shops,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and mighty Quaffers, Health-Drinkers and
Epicurers, that 'twas their usual Practice to haunt
the Play-house, the Bawdy-house and Publick-houses
by turns, and to go from the one to the
other, and that the Play-house was the common
Place where their Riotous Meetings at Taverns
were appointed, and the Reason he gives of it is
this, because Drunkenness, Epicurism, Luxury
and Profuseness were Rhetorically applauded on
the Stage, and set off with the highest Enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miums;
and those who spent their Estates this
way, were dignified by the Poets, with the Title
of Brave, Generous, Liberal and Jovial Sparks;
as <hi>Iuvenal</hi> expresses it:</p>

            <p>As to Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi>'s seeming to think unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
a less Sin than Gaming, and that the Love

               </gap>men encouraged by the Stage is a good
Preservative against Sodomy, it's ridiculous. To
allow one sin to prevent another, is Play-house
Divinity, and to advance that the inflaming of
Lust is a proper way to prevent it's exerting it
self upon unnatural Objects is an odd kind of
Philosophy.</p>
            <p>If the Play-house have this Effect now, its
more than it had formerly, when we find that the
profligate Custom of Men, and Womens putting
one anothers Apparel promiscuously on the Stage,
was a mighty incentive to that sort of Villany.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sophocles</hi> the famous Greek Tragedian, whom

<hi>Libidinibus insanis in viros, viri prorunt,</hi> &amp;c.
St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> brings the same Accusation against

notice of in my Answer to the Reviewer, and
therefore shall only Answer what Mr. <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi>
has advanc'd that is new; and the first is,
that the Stage is of admirable advantage to Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and that the Theatre is certainly the best
School in the World for History, Poetry and
Eloquence<note n="†" place="margin">P. 35, 36.</note>.</p>
            <p>Enough has been said already to prove that it
can be of no solid advantage to Learning; for
when Mens Minds are infected with Vice, they
are not fit for any profitable or generous Study, as
appears by <hi>Seneca</hi>'s Complaint, that the Stage
diverted the People from attending on his Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophical
Lectures. As to History, the falshood of
the Assertion is plain; for we may learn more of
that by reading the Greek, Roman, and other Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians,
than by all the Plays that have ever
been writ, which for a mangled scrap now and
then of true History, have ten times more of Fable.</p>
            <p>Then as to the point of Eloquence: We have
<hi>Quintilian</hi> the famous Orator against him, who in
his Directions, How an Orator should frame his
Speech, Voice and Gesture, enjoins frequent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming,
and the often repeating of Eloquent
Orations, but expresly forbids him, <hi rend="margQuotes">to imitate
Players or the Custom of the Stage, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
express or act the Slaves, the Drunkards, Lovers
or any such Play-house part, because they were
no ways necessary for an Orator, but would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
corrupt his Mind and Manners than any
way help his Elocution or Action</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Instit. Orat.</hi>

                  </gap>. 1. c. 18, 19</note>. And I would
very fain know of Mr. <hi>Dennis,</hi> which of all the
Admirers of the Stage can be compar'd for Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
to St. <hi>Chrysostom, Tertullian,</hi> St. <hi>Ierom,</hi>
and the rest of the Fathers that never frequented
the Stage but wrote against it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:98165:100"/>But granting it to be true, that the Theatre
promoted Eloquence, we may very well say
with St. <hi>Ierom, Melius est aliquid Nescire, quam
cum periculo discere</hi>

run such a risk for it. Besides, an Orator ought
to be Grave and Serious, whereas the Stage is
Light, Wanton and Lewd. If <hi>Cicero</hi> that great
Master of Eloquence had thought the Stage ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for promoting that desirable Attainment,
or had he ow'd his Formation to it, in so great a
measure, as Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi> says he did<note n="*" place="margin">Page 36.</note>, certainly
he would never have been so much an Enemy to

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ence or so ungrateful to the School, whence
he learn'd it himself, as to advise the Romans <hi>to
abandon it, lest it should render them Effeminate
and Corrupt, and so overturn their Empire, as it
had done that of the Greeks</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Tusculan Quaest. l.</hi> 4.</note>, he would rather
have advis'd the Reforming of it, as Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi>
does, but that he saw 'twas impracticable, and
would turn to as little account as Plowing the
Sand: Nor can he ever prove, that <hi>Demoshenes</hi>
acquir'd his Oratry by frequenting the Stage.
<hi>Plutarch</hi> tells us he repeated his Speeches before
a large Looking<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>Glass to regulate his Gestures.
But admitting once for all, that there's a great
deal of Eloquence, Wit, Invention, History and
other parts of Learning in Stage-Plays, there's so
much Obscenity, Scurrility and Lewdness mix'd
with it, that it only serves as a Tincture of Sugar
or a Glass of Cordial to convey a venemous Poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the stronger the Wine, or the better the

with the sweetest, most savory and best relishing

            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi> alledges [pag. 36.] that before
<hi>Thespis</hi> appeared in <hi>Attica,</hi> and reduc'd the

be esteemed by Posterity, which is notoriously
False; For <hi>Thales</hi> who is reckond the first of the

another of them, who is justly accounted the

having seen one of his Tragedies, oppos'd him to

him for the Lies utter'd in his Play; and told him
if his <hi>Drama</hi> were approv'd, they should quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

the Stage was nipp'd in the bud, and yet I must
tell our Author, that it was not then manag'd in
so lew'd a manner as it is now (tho' bad enough
it seems to be censur'd by <hi>Solon</hi>) for <hi>Diogenes

<hi>c.</hi> I. The famous <hi>Du Plessis Mornay,</hi> writ a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy

recommends that Tragedy to her, because there

            <p>Our Author's Assertion, <hi rend="margQuotes">That the Stage was E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished
in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Time, and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished
in that of K. <hi>Iames,</hi> upon which <hi>Spencer,
Bacon</hi> and <hi>Raleigh,</hi> three Prodigies of Wit, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
all at once, and that we had no first-rate
Writer till <hi>Henry</hi> VIII.</hi> is like the rest of his
Learning and Confidence. It was so far from
being established in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Time, tho'
it had then but too much Incouragement, that all
the Play-houses in <hi>London</hi> were suppressed upon a
Petition to that Queen in 1580.—The
Stage was restrained by the 14th and 39th of her
Reign, and Books against it, there dedicated to her
Secretary <hi>Walsingham,</hi> and it was so far from
flourishing in King <hi>Iames</hi> I. time, that in the 1st
Year of his Reign, Stage-Players were by Act of
Parliament declared Rogues and Vagabonds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:98165:102"/>
as has been already said under the Head of <hi>The
English State against the Stage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the Learning of <hi>Bacon</hi> and <hi>Raleigh,</hi> it
surpasses Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi>'s Skill to prove that it was
any way owing to the Stage, and indeed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his solid way of Writing, he owns as
much himself, when he says, immediately upon
the Establishment of the <hi>Drama,</hi> those three Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies
of Wit appear'd.</p>
            <p>And I must likewise observe, That <hi>Bacon</hi> and
<hi>Raleigh</hi> (as he calls them) employed themselves
in more generous and manly Studies, than any
the Stage can boast of, as appears by the Learned
Works they have left behind them.</p>
            <p>As to the other part of his Assertion, that we
had no first-rate Writer on any Subject before
<hi>Henry</hi> VIII. it's an injury to the Nation, and a
proof of his own Assurance and Ignorance. To
name but a few.</p>
            <p>What does he say to <hi>Rog. Bacon</hi> who liv'd in the
13th Centry, and for his skill in the Mathematicks,
was esteemed a Conjurer, and summoned to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
at <hi>Rome</hi> on that account, where he cleared
himself and was sent back again. To go a little
higher.</p>
            <p>What does he think of the Venerable <hi>Bede,</hi> who
liv'd in the beginning of the 8th Century, from
the Birth of Christ, to whose time <hi>Bale</hi> reckons
but 79 British Writers? Did he never hear of Sir
<hi>Thomas Littleton,</hi> the Oracle of the Law, who
liv'd in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> VI. of <hi>Bracton</hi> or
<hi>Fortescue?</hi> But because I will trouble my Reader
with no more, I would advise Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi> to turn
over <hi>Bale's</hi> Centuries of English Writers, and
there he will find his bold Assertion to be shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
False: For in the 8th Century; that Author
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:98165:103"/>
reckons 18 more Writers besides <hi>Bede,</hi> 7 in the
9th, 14 in the 10th, 18 in the 11th, 87 in the
12th, amongst whom were 6 of the <hi>Decem. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliae
Scriptores;</hi> 123 in the 13th, 244 in the 14th,
137 in the 15th; and from thence to the Year
1557. but 137 more. Not that these were all
First rate Writers, but it is sufficient to shew, that
the State of Learning was not so low in <hi>England</hi>
as Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi> would represent it to have been:
And that the increase and decrease of Learning,
has no dependency on the Stage; all that our
Plays can pretend to teach, being only some scraps
of Rheto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ick and History, which may be much
better learn'd elsewhere.</p>
            <p>The Reflections which he casts on the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
times when the Stage was abolish'd, are full
of Malice and Ignorance. No Man can expect
that Learning should flourish during an Intestine
War, yet those Times were not without Eminent
Scholars in all Faculties; and upon Enquiry it
will be found, that most of the great Men <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
can boast of, laid the Foundation of their
Studies, and formed their Thoughts before the
Stage was restored by King <hi>Charles</hi> II. The World
cannot deny, but <hi>Selden</hi> and <hi>Milton</hi> were famous
for Learning, tho' they were of the Parliaments
side, &amp;ow'd nothing of their Education to the Stage.
Nor can our Author pretend, that the Lord Chief
Justice <hi>Halcs,</hi> or the Beginners of the Royal So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
the Doctors, <hi>Ward, Wilkins, Wallis,</hi> &amp;c. or
the famous Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> were any thing indebted to
the Theatre for their great Learning.</p>
            <p>The slovenly Reflection he casts on the Divines
of those times, sufficiently discovers, that he's
but sorrily read in Divinity.</p>
            <p>The Doctors, <hi>Calamy, Case</hi> and <hi>Manton</hi> (whom
he mentions with so much Contempt,) are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd
by better Judges than any that writes for
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:98165:103"/>
the Theatre, the good acceptance which the
latter's Volumes of Sermons have met with from
the Publick, have sufficiently proclaimed their
Value; and if our Author had a little bethought
himself,—the great Archbishop <hi>Usher</hi> flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished
in those times, who was no Friend to the
Stage; The most Learned Bishop of <hi>Worcester,</hi>

            <p>In a word: The Reflection is so malicious and

            <p>I come now to his Second Part.</p>
            <p>Where in the first Chapter he asserts with his
usual Confidence, <hi rend="margQuotes">That the Stage is useful to the
Government;</hi> which if true, the Antient Greeks
and Romans, who understood Government the
best of any People in the Gentile World, were
very much in the wrong when they banished the
Stage by the Decree of the State (as has been
already mentioned) and the Government of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
were mightily out in their Measures in the

How came the Jews to be so foully mistaken, as to

            <q>
               <p>Nothing, says Mr. <hi>Dennis,</hi> is more capable
than Tragedy, of raising the Soul, and giving it
that Greatness, that Courage, that Force, and that
Constancy, which are the Qualifications that
make men deserve to command others; which
is evident from Experience. For they who in
all Countries, and in all Ages, have appeared
most to feel the power of Tragedy, have been
the most deserving, and the greatest of Men.
<hi>Aeschylus</hi> among the Athenians was a great Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and Tragick Poet. <hi>Sophocles</hi> an able States.
man, and a victorious General. The very great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
among the Romans were so far touch'd with
the Drama, as either to write their Plays them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
or to build their Theatres; witness <hi>Scipio,
Lelius, Lucullus, Mecenas, Iulius</hi> and <hi>Augustus.</hi>
None among the French has shew'd so much
greatness of Mind as <hi>Richlieu;</hi> and none so much
passion for the Drama, which was so great, that
he writ several Plays with that very hand which
at the same time was laying the Plan of the
French Universal Monarchy.</p>
            </q>
            <p>This is one of Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi>'s raptures, when ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
to Divinity, which inspir'd his Pen with ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resistible
Arguments: But I am afraid his Divinity
is not of the right stamp; for had he look'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Divine Records, he would have found
that <hi>Moses, Ioshua, Iepthah, Samson, David</hi> and
others have far out-done all that he has nam'd,
for greatness of Courage, and qualifications for
Government, and yet never one of them saw a
Tragedy. <hi>Hunniades, Scanderbeg, Tamerlan, Zisca,
Gustavus Adolphus,</hi> were equal for Valour to any
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:98165:105"/>
of his great Samplars, and yet not one of 'em
were inspir'd by the Stage. Then for the mighty
<hi>Richlieu,</hi> he was so far over-match'd by his own
Contemporary, <hi>Oliver</hi> the Stage-hater, that for all
the Courage of his Tragical Pen, he could not
save himself nor his Country from trembling,
when the Usurper Roar'd. Nor was the Theatre
able to cure his own Ambition: But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
Mr. <hi>Dennis's probatum est,</hi> with the same
Hand that he wrote his Plays, he laid the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the hatefullest Tyranny that <hi>Europe</hi> hath
known for several Ages. I must also make bold
to tell Mr. <hi>Dennis,</hi> that the countenance given to
the Stage by <hi>Iulius Caesar, Pompey,</hi> and other
aspiring Romans, seems rather to have been the
effect of their Ambition, than propos'd as a cure
for it, that by immersing the people in Deban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery
and Pleasures, they should be render'd the
less careful of their Expiring Liberties, which the
Senate being aware of, thought fit whilst they
had any power left them, to cashier the Stage;
and this being the Opinion of the State, is more to
be regarded than that of any particular person how
great soever. It's likewise worthy of our obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
that <hi>Augustus</hi> himself, and severall other
Emperours who favour'd the Stage, were sore'd to
discharge it at last as a Nursery of Lewdness and
Villany. <hi>Scipio Nascica</hi> a great General, who by
Vote of the Senate was declar'd the best Man of
the Common-wealth, because of his extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Valour, Prudence and Morality, suppress'd the
Stage as destructive to the Morals of the People.
<hi>Trajan,</hi> who if <hi>Pliny</hi> may be credited, was one
of the best Roman Emperours, did the like: And
the Emperour <hi>Alexander Severus,</hi> who was none
of the worlt of them, withdrew the Pensions of
the Players; so that all that were great among
the Romans, were far from favouring the Stage.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:98165:105"/>The Influence which Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi> ascribes to the
Stage, in preventing Rebellions amongst the
People<note n="†" place="margin">Page 56.</note>, is equally ridiculous with his other
Propositions. It's but a few of the People at best,
who have either time, opportunity or money to
frequent the Theatre; so that by necessary conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
its Influence can never be universal; but
besides, he is contradicted by matter of fact, the
Incouragement given to the Stage here in <hi>England,</hi>
could neither prevent the opposition made by the
Parliament and People to <hi>Charles</hi> the Ist, nor the
Plots of the Papists against <hi>Charles</hi> the IId. nor
the Revolt of the Nation from the last K. <hi>Iames.</hi>
The Stage in <hi>France</hi> could not prevent the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
against <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV during his Minority; and
it's remarkable, that the Protestants of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
who have declar'd against the Theatre in
a National Council, as before mentioned, were
his firmest Friends.</p>
            <p>It's pleasant to read how this Stage Panegyrist
will in spite of History and common Sense
ascribe all the Great things done by the Greeks
and Romans to the Influence of the Stage<note n="†" place="margin">p. 59, &amp;c.</note>, when
the States of both condemned them, as occasion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a dissolution of Manners, which render'd them
unfit either to defend themselves, or to conquer
others. And <hi>Themistocles</hi> in particular, who is
one of the Generals he mentions, had so low an
Opinion of the Theatre, that he made a Law
against Magistrates frequenting it, lest the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
wealth should seem to play and loiter in the
Stage<note n="†" place="margin">Plutarch in Vita The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist.</note>. <hi>Pericles,</hi> another of them, who was
joint Pretor with <hi>Sophocles,</hi> rebuk'd his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
for beholding and commending a beautiful
Boy, telling him that wanton looks did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a Pretor<note n="*" place="margin">Io. Sarisb. Nug. Cunal. lib. 1. cap. 8.</note>; what would he have said then
of the Modern Stage? Our Author has forgot to
mention <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, the Discipline and
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:98165:106"/>
Apparel, of whose Army smelt nothing at all of
the gawdy and lascivious Theatre, and yet his
Conquests exceeded all those of the other Greek
Captains he hath nam'd.</p>
            <p>Then as to his Roman Instances, <hi>Scipio Africa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
was so far from approving the Follies of the
Stage, that he pitied the Common-wealth, as
drawing near its Ruine, when he saw the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of the Nobility bred up to Dancing, and
singing to the praise of Stage-Players, which their
Ancestors reckon'd disgraceful<note n="†" place="margin">Salust. Saturnal. lib. 3.</note>; and therefore
his building, or rather advising a sort of Reform
as to the Seats of the Theatre, to distinguish the
Senators from the People, seems rather to have
proceeded from a Compliance with Custom, and
a design to humour the Times, than from his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
of Stage-Plays. Besides, there's no man
acquainted with Roman History, but must needs
know that their Theatres were applied to other
uses, as publick Orations, and the Execution of
Malefactors; so that the Erecting of a Theatre,
will not always infer the approbation of the
Drama.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pompey</hi> indeed built a Theatre of Stone after
the former had been destroyed by <hi>Scipio Nasica,</hi>
and to prevent its being demolish'd by the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
in time to come, Erected a Temple of <hi>Venus</hi>
on the top of it, which was no great proof that
it was designed for a Reformation of Manners;
and this the Senate was so sensible of, that they
blam'd <hi>Pompey</hi> for Building his Theatre, as I have
said already.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi> in the same ridiculous manner
<hi rend="margQuotes">ascribes the Union of the French, and their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests
to the Influence of the Drama, and the
loss of their Conquests to the ceasing of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Dramatick Poetry among 'em before the
beginning of the last War</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">p. 61.</note>.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:98165:106"/>But if he would be pleased to look back to the
Time of <hi>Charlemaigne,</hi> who was a Mortal
Enemy to the Stage, he will find that <hi>France</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
her Conquests a great deal further then,
under his Conduct, than she has done by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
of the <hi>Drama</hi> under <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. and kept
them longer too: And I would pray him to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
that our own Glorious Sovereign King
<hi>William,</hi> who hath oblig'd the French to resign
their Conquests, is no great Admirer of the Stage;
so that it's something else than the <hi>Drama</hi> that
hath given him the Ascendant over <hi>France.</hi> And the
World must own that his Courage and Conduct,
and Qualifications for Government are equal to
any of those whom Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi> has mentioned,
as the great Patrons of the Theatre.</p>
            <p>In his Second Chapter<note n="*" place="margin">From p. 63 to 68.</note>, he would perswade
the World, <hi rend="margQuotes">That the Stage is particularly use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to the English and especially the present Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
because the English are more prone to
Rebellion than any People upon the Face of the
Earth; and that we have been longer at quiet
since the flourishing of the <hi>Drama,</hi> than at any
time before since the Conquest; and that the
Civil War was begun by those that were Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to the Stage.</hi>—So much for its
Usefulness to the English in general.</p>
            <p>Then he proves its Usefulness to this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in particular, <hi rend="margQuotes">Because some of its Friends
would prove averse to it, if the Stage were
either suppress'd or very much discouraged, and
that it diverts the Enemies of the Government,
hinders their Plotting, and frequenting <hi>Iacobite
Conventicles.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here's another piece of Civility to the Nation
again; <hi>They are the greatest Rebels on Earth</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to him; but this I have answer'd already.
That we have had more Peace since the flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:98165:107"/>
of the <hi>Drama,</hi> than at any time since the
Conquest is false. It cannot be said to have flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished
but since the Restoration of <hi>Charles</hi> II. For
it was restrained in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Time, by
Act of Parliament, and banished the City of
<hi>London,</hi> (as has been already said) yet her's was
a Long and a Peaceable Reign.</p>
            <p>Stage-Players were condemned as Rogues in
that of King <hi>Iames,</hi> yet we had Peace all his
time.—But the unanswerable Argument is
this, Those that rebell'd against <hi>Charles</hi> I. were
Enemies to the Stage: But if Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi> will
be pleased to look back, he will find I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
That the Incendiaries and Fomenters of the
Civil War, were the Friends of the Stage,
who taught Rebellion against our Constitution,
set the King above all Laws, and would have trod
Parliaments under foot, who are two thirds of our
Government, if the two States of Lords and
Commons may be allowed that Name. But if
this will not do, what will Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi> reply, if
I tell him, that those very Men who were Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to the Stage, or at least their Successors in
Principle and Practice, who abhor the Tyranny of
41, as much as Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi> abhors the Rebellion
on't, are the firmest Friends this Government has:
And here I'll venture to say once for all, That it's
very dangerous to our present Establishment to
have the Theatre manag'd by such kind of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
as our Author and others, who exclaim with
so much Malice and Ignora<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> against those very

               </gap> the Happy Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution;
for if resisting or dethroning a Prince be in
no case Lawful, which is the common Theme and
known Principle of most of the Libellers against
41, it will by necessary Consequence, condemn
the Revolution of 1688. So very useful are some
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:98165:107"/>
of the late Advocates and Authors for the Stage
to the present Government (I will not say all
that have writ Plays) for I know that Mr. <hi>Tate,</hi>
and some others, whose Parts deserve a better
Imployment, are Persons of Generous English
Principles.</p>
            <p>Our Authors Insinuation, that the Suppression
or Discouraging of the Stage, would create an
Aversion in any of the Friends of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the present Constitution, is so very silly,
that certainly he must be ashamed of it himself
upon second Thoughts.—Does he think
that a Prince of such Courage and Bravery as ours,
puts any Value upon the Friendship or Enmity of
a parcel of Men, who have been declared Rogues
and Vagabonds by the Statute, or that the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
would any way resent the overturning of
the Stage, which never had any continued Footing
nor settled Incouragement among us, but under
the Reign of a Luxurious Prince, especially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
how Instrumental it has been to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauching
of our Youth? Does he think that the
People, who have look'd on with Satisfaction to
see several of those Non-jurant Bishops turn'd
out of their Sees, though once they ador'd them,
when Petitioners against King <hi>Iames</hi>'s Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
would bestow one sigh on the lew'd Stage,
though it were first pull'd down, and then built
up again, to make its own Funeral Pile. The
contrary would be so true that thousands of Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,
Parents and Masters, who have had their
Wives, Children and Servants debauched by it,
would gladly throw up their Hatts at such a
Bonfire, and lay such a curse upon those that
should ever attempt to erect another Stage, as
<hi>Ioshua</hi> laid upon the Re-builder of <hi>Iericho.</hi> The
Nation is brought to a delicate pass indeed, when
we must not talk of overturning the Stage, but a
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:98165:108"/>
parcel of debauched Wits will threaten the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>If the Thing were worthy of His Majesties
Notice, he might well answer in the Words of
<hi>Augustus,</hi> formerly mentioned in the like case,
<hi>That he had been powerful enough to make his
Enemies stoop, and is he not able now to banish
Iesters and Fools.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His next Insinuation, <hi rend="margQuotes">That it diverts the <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobites,</hi>
and prevents their Plots and Conventicles,</hi>
is equally absur'd: Let him but cast an Eye up to
<hi>Westminster-Hall,</hi> or the City Gates, and there
the Heads and Limbs of <hi>Charnock, Perkins</hi> and
<hi>Friend,</hi> &amp;c. will tell him to his Face that he's
mistaken.</p>
            <p>His Answers to the Objections from Authority,
in the Third Chapter, I shall pass over, as having
said enough on that Head already, in Answer to
others. And as for his Pretence in the rest of his
Book, to shew the Usefulness of the Stage to
the Advancement of Religion, it's only a further
proof of his Vanity and intollerable Confidence,
seeing Fathers, Councils, and the best of Divines
in all Ages have demonstrated the contrary; to
their Arguments that I have quoted already, I
refer him, and so bid him <hi>Farewel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If he think that I have not used him with that
Smoothness that he might have expected, let him
remember how he treated the whole Nation as
Splenetick Rebels, the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> in

Times as Blockheads and Hypocrites.</p>

            <p>Thus we see that our Universities formerly
condemn'd the Stage, and that they came after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to countenance them, must without doubt
be ascribed to the Influence of K. <hi>Charles,</hi> I. and

the Students of <hi>Christ-Church</hi> in <hi>Oxford</hi> presented a

Queen,</hi> which was afterwards presented again to
Their Majesties at <hi>Hampton-Court;</hi> and the 2d.

               <head>Remarks upon the Universities Plays before
King Charles I.</head>
               <p>The Poet values himself in the Prologue upon
the Dignity of his Audience, but chiefly addresses
himself to the Ladies, whose Beauties, he says,
made the whole Assembly glad. Whether the Play
was altogether so pure and chast as became His
Majesties presence, the Gravity of the University,
and the Modesty of the Ladies we shall see af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards;
but this very hint of the Beauty of the
Ladies cheering the hearts of the Assembly, will
fall under our Saviours Reproof, of not looking
upon a Woman to lust after her, and is the very
thing for which St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> declaims against
Plays, as we have heard already. Nor can it be
reconcileable to the purity of the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
which hath set a Bar upon our very Looks,
for Men and Women to haunt Play-houses in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to ogle one another, as the Stage-Poets them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
now express it.</p>
               <p>Then for the Play it self.</p>
               <p>The Dialogue betwixt <hi>Albumazar, Harpax</hi> and
<hi>Ronca</hi> where they applaud Theft and Robbery, as
that which made the <hi>Spartans</hi> Valiant and <hi>Arabia</hi>
Happy, and charge it on all Trades and Callings,
tho' guilt with the smooth Title of Merchant,
Lawyer or the like, could have no Natural Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
to teach Moral Honesty. Whether it might
have any design to justifie the after Practices of
Levying Money without Consent of Parliament,
Ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>orting Loan Money from Merchants and Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
as being only a better sort of Thieves; or
to justifie Plundering the Country, as the Histories
of those times say was very usual amongst the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:98165:110"/>
King's Soldiers afterwards, I know not, but the
Fable seems to carry some such Moral, and the
Authority of an University would go a great way
among Libertines; so that it could but be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
by the least <hi>Innuendo,</hi> tho' never so much
wrested. <hi>Albumazar</hi>'s insisting upon <hi>Great Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,</hi>
as the Cardinal Virtue, and it being Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
too in <hi>Italick,</hi> would seem to strengthen the
Conjecture, especially seeing he goes on to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
all Mankind as Thieves; and that the very
Members of Man's Body are fram'd by Nature, so
as to steal from one another, which is good
enough Authority for the Head to steal from all
the rest.</p>
               <p>The 2d Scene, Containing a Discourse betwixt
<hi>Pandolfo,</hi> an old Fellow of 60, in Love with <hi>Flavia,</hi>
a Girl of 16, and <hi>Cricca</hi> his Servant, is far from
being Chast.—I cannot imagine what Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
it could afford to the Audience to hear an
old Man insist upon his Vigor and Fitness for a
young Girl, and his Servant on the other hand
telling him, that one Nights Lodging would so
much enfeeble him, as <hi>Flavia</hi> would make him a
Cuckold. This seems more adapted to expose to
Laughter the Dotage that old Age is now and then
subject to, and to justifie the Disloyalty of a
young Wife so Wedded, than to bewail or reprove
such Folly on both sides.</p>
               <p>It had been more becoming a Supream Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
to provide against such unsuitable
Matches by wholsom Laws, than to have had
them represented as the Subject of Mirth on a
Stage; as it would have been more decent for
an University to have given him such Counsel,
than to divert him with such ridiculous Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:98165:110"/>The Dialogue betwixt <hi>Albumazar, Pandolfo</hi> and
<hi>Cricca, [about Astrology</hi>] is a meer Rhapsody of
studied Nonsence, which looks very unlike
the Practice of Christians, whose great Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver
tells them,<note place="margin">Luke 18. 36.</note> 
                  <hi>They must be accountable for
every idle Word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Courtship betwixt <hi>Trincalo</hi> a Farmer,
and <hi>Armellina, Pandolfo</hi>'s Maid;—wherein
<hi>Trincalo compares himself to a lusty strong Ass,</hi>
and her to a <hi>Wanton young Filly,</hi> and that they
should have a race of <hi>Mules</hi> if she were willing;
is so very Coarse and throws so much Contempt
upon the Country Farmers, who are so useful to
the Nation, that it can neither be reconciled to
the Maxims of Christianity nor Common Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy.</p>
               <p>In short, the whole Comedy is far from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
any thing of a tendency to Vertue in it,
except Reflections upon the City, as not afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a <hi>Dozen</hi> of <hi>Chast VIRGINS,</hi> and the
like on Sheriffs and Justices of Peace as <hi>Chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and Hectoring their Neighbours,</hi> and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
<hi>Country Gentlemen,</hi> as minding nothing

                  </gap>ous Representations.</p>
               <p>If it be said as usual, that those Vices are
represented in order to make them be abhorr'd,
and the Guilty Persons ashamed of them, it is
easie to Answer, That a Supream Magistrate is
authoriz'd by God and the Laws of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
to punish those Vices by the Sword
of Justice, which will be ten times more effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:98165:111"/>
than making them the Subject of Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
on a Stage.</p>
               <p>I come next to the <hi>Royal Slave,</hi> a Tragi Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,
presented to the King and Queen by the
Students of <hi>Christ-Church</hi> in <hi>Oxford.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Prologue to the King and Queen is on
the <hi>Representation of one of the Person Magi,
discovered in a Temple worshipping the Sun, and
at the sight of a new Majesty, he leaves the Altar
and addresseth himself to the Throne.</hi> What
Moral this can include, is hard to determine, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it were that they had a mind to insinuate
that it was no Crime to Sacrifice Religion to the
Court, as too many of them attempted to do
in reality, when they embrac'd Doctrines, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to those of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> for
which some of them (as <hi>Laud, Montague</hi> and
others) were censur'd by the Parliament after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <p>In the Prologue to the University, there's a
Jerk at some that they call <hi>Late damned Books,</hi>
and wich they hoped would inspire none of the
University with a harsh Opinion of the Play,
which they alledge was so innocent, that the
<hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ittle Ruff</hi> or <hi>Careless</hi> might be present at it,
without fear, and they valued themselves highly
upon the Presence of their Majesties, as giving
Life to the Performance, and the King's Servants
spoke much in the same manner, when they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
it before them at <hi>Hampton Court.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first Act represents a parcel of <hi>drunken
Ephesian Captives, revelling in their Chains,</hi> and
<hi>calling for VVheres,</hi> but bidding their Goaler and
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:98165:111"/>
his Wife be sure that they did not suffer any of
the <hi>Young Students of the LAW</hi> to forestal the
Market. The Goaler too has a Jerk at the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
of Singing Psalms at the Gallows. All
which I humbly conceive was an Entertainment
no way suited to the Royal Majesty of a King,
nor to the modesty of a Queen: Nor was it any
thing for the Credit of the Nation, that the
Reins of Publick Discipline should be so far let
loose as to suffer such Practices amongst the young
Students of the Law, if that was the Moral of
the Fable.</p>
               <p>The Rape attempted afterwards upon the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian
Queen and her Ladies by those Ephesian Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
and their lewd Discourses from time to
time, was no very good Lesson, nor meet En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
for a Queen. And their bringing in the
Persian Courtiers, yielding compleat Obedience
to <hi>Cratander,</hi> a Mock-King for three Days, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>Arsamnes</hi> their Prince commanded it, and
at the same time divested himself of his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
for that space, seems to teach the slavish Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

so much then contended for by the Court,
<hi>that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

having his Commission under any Pretence what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,</hi>
tho' he should ev'n overturn the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of their Constitution, as here their Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
<hi>Arsamnes</hi> did by making a Captive King of
<hi>Persia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nay, and this Play too which they pretend
was so fram'd as it could give no offence to the
Gravity of the University or Clergy, represents
<hi>Atossa</hi> the Queen a little inclining to the Taint
of an Unlawful Amour with <hi>Cratander</hi> the Three-Days<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and him Entertaining it also, tho' at

               <p>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:98165:112"/>Indeed there's <hi>Praxaspis</hi>'s Saying in the Second

and admire it most, are never reform'd by it.</p>
               <p>I shall forbear any further Remarks upon those
Plays, these being enough to make good the
Charge, that our Universities have encouraged the
Stage, which is so much the more Criminal in
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

nor any Consideration whatever, were able to
prevail with them; so that the Universities became
infected with the Contagion of the Stage, and
they being the Nurseries of Officers for the
Church and State it was no wonder, if the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
spread from them, all over the Kingdom,
especially being patroniz'd by the Court and
