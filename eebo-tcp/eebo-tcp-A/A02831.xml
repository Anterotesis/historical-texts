            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For it wes not vnknowen to me how familiare he hath bene with the scolastike So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phisters, their thornie questions, and scabrus conclusions yea, and some of the ancient Doctors, whose writinges, what by ignorance of tyme seduced, what by affection ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed away, I thoght wel he should wreist to his vngodly opinion. So that I wes driuen not without sobing, gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, syghing, and bitter teares to lament a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d bewale the state of the simple and vnlearned, who in such repugnancie of contrarious opinions, could not wit whereunto to cleaue, nor what they should follow. And to speak frely on the other part, in respect of the amitie that hath other times
<pb facs="tcp:11:8"/>
interceded betuix the Abbote and me. I wes not lytle mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that he (for I can not tell what applausion &amp; fame to be reported of the wicked and vngodly) shoulde hasserd and euenture his existimation in so impius, foolishe, and vaine a purpose, that he not vnlyke to the Gya<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, should oppugne the manifest treuth of God: and so to giue him self forth a baner man to all the wicked in a disperate cause And fynally that he should giue and bestowe his tyme so, that it myght seme, rather that he proceadeth from the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, to the Asses (as is in the Prouerbe) then from the Asses to the Oxen.</p>
            <p>This my querimonie wes common to all the learned &amp; godlie: who as they compleaned vpon the entreatment of the simple, so did they wonder, that a man of his owne studie, without all conference with men of letters, yea, and neuer hauing hard the doctrine teached: but seperate out of the Tentes of the people of God, to a certane cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and Celle asyde, to be rauished to suche a phrenesie, as to damne the eternall veritie of God, to declare warre to all godlie men, and vnder the cullor and pretext of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, to shaw his owne infancie, and oppen vp his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and so to expone him self to mockage and derision. On the other syde it wes somewhat confortable, that we ꝑceaued god, as it were, ready bent to haue his veritie exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined and tryed, and for this cause to haue it stoutlie as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayled and violentlie inuaded, that the victorie enseuing, may be the more tryumphant and glorious. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer wes the expectation of this golden birth, before it wes broght to lyght: Alwayes it that is moste conforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble I do marck, the curages of them that did moste brage of it to be fallen,<note place="margin">The cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages of the depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deces v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone the abbotes boke, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated.</note> being altogether frustrate of their expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: the simple to be nothing moued: the learned and the godly to compleane of the tyme ociusly and prophanely spent, which is so precious that the Apostle Paule willeth vs to redeame it by all meanes.</p>
            <p>To the tryfles that be gathered out in this treatie, albeit answer be made euerie day in the Sermons, and euerie boye that hath sene the Catechisme is able to refell them: yet seing the desyre is of many that they be confuted by writing: the charge being lade to me, I could not refuse it, nor deny my lauboure to the Church of God, iudgeing it rather to stand with my deutie, to obey the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:11:8"/>
of the Congregation, in the defence of Gods cause and the treuth, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue respect to an withered &amp; intermitted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, yea, althogh it were neuer so straite and deare.</p>
            <p>Now before I enter into the matter, let no man loke for suche horrible and blasphemous imprecations of me, as this Author maketh in syndrie places of his Famous worke of the masse. For such imprecations, as they procead of an obstinate and contumatious heart, so they be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Deuillish, to deceaue and draw back the simple igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and vnskilful Reader, vnto vtter distructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, althogh they be without all authoritie of Scripture, or exemple of the godlie Fathers.</p>
            <p>The authoritie of Paule shalbe found so farre soght, and so impertinent to the purpose, that I truste our holy Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bote will not leane thereto. And albeit he shall so do, we knowe with what Spirite Paule wes led, and his pen directed.</p>
            <p>Do we reid at any tyme, that Cypriane, Augustyne, Hierome, Chrisostome, Theophilactus, Tertuliane and the rest of the ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t wariors, stirred vp from time to time,<note place="margin">The ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot with<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>out al ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>emple of any god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, renu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth god<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>es mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</note> by Gods holy Spirite, for the auenging of his cause aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist the vnhappy sead and members of Sathan, hauing to do with no les pertinacious and wicked enimies to all treuth and Religion, nor we instantly: do we reid, I say againe, that euer thus madlie, and blasphemuslie they do renounce Gods mercies, and submit them to his seuere iudgementes: I am able to say: not.</p>
            <p>But I can shaw you, Sire, of what fontane, these your blasphemies do flowe. We reid in deid that the Prophetes of Baall,<note place="margin">1. Reg. 18 28.</note> ordinarlie did smyte them selues with knyues and Lancettes, and that (as appeared to them) wes no vaine cerimonie, but vsed to this end, that the people myght be hereby moued to credite them, and they getting authoritie to their fond dreames myght be iudged moste strong in defence of their opinion.</p>
            <p>And this shall we obserue, in all Authors of vntreuth, and forgers of lies, that continually to affirme their impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous doctrine: ether shall they vse prouocations to Gods iudgementes, ether to such corporall chastisment shal they submit them, as may seme to declare in the inuenters of a fals Religion, an zeal to iustice and equitie: a bolde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in their opinion: and a wil to suffer the extremitie,
<pb facs="tcp:11:9"/>
for the defence of that which they manteane.</p>
            <p>Thus hath God moste iustlie permitted the deuill to blinde men in all ages, who more delyteth in their owne imaginations, then in the treuth of God plainely reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. The Analogie and similytude, were verie proper be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuix the Preistes of Baall, and the Popes shauelinges:<note place="margin">A compa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rison be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuixt Ba<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lams pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>istes and the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes.</note> in the discurs of the whole, if I should dishiffer to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulare: of the dum &amp; deaf god of the one: the caike god of the other: the incantations of the one, the sorcerie of the other: the stoike grauitie of the ministers of the one: and the stubborne morositie of the other: the dissolute lyfe of the one: and the ryote of the other, and so forthe, as were moste easie to draw to him that should set his ingine he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, and that not without fructe to the Reader.</p>
            <p>Thus then let vs gather this note, whereby we may discerne the rauenus and disceatfull wolfe, from the godlie and religious Pastor, to wit, by these extraordinarie and horrible imprecations:<note place="margin">An great swearer, is alway<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>es suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ct of gret falshead.</note> by suche prophane and barbarous renouncing of Gods mercies. For as in iudgement the deposition of him that sweareth moste enormely and hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuslie, is not of greatest faith and authoritie, but rather is the more suspected. So haue we to iudge of his preposterꝰ and inuerted Silenus who regardeth nothing the propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and abuse of Gods holy Name, and so to make him author of vntreuth: speaking only to draw the people vnwarres to his deuillish fantasies.</p>
            <p>My purpose is then to procead through the weightie argumentes (for so he will haue them seming) and shawe to him with all modestie, wherein he deceaueth him self, what is wrongously and preposterusly drawen to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, wherein he abuseth the Text of Gods worde and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the Fathers.<note place="margin">If the Abbote appereth enraged in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g what wold he shew hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>self in speaki<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g.</note> Fynally to supplie the parte of Iames, who as he is introduced verie simple, so he tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth him self to be to hastelie vainquest. To such an Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane, shall I neuer commit my hould in keaping, nether yet to such an aduocat, the defence of my iuste cause.</p>
            <p>To that I haue passed through the whole, I will not speak of this, that our Author doeth wonder the masse to be called Idolatrie and witchcraft, and pronounceth bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, all them to be possessed, that so doeth affirme (it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth well that the man hath bene in an great rage of seuer: for if the wordes, he here infarceth, shoulde haue bene
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:11:9"/>
pronounced by mouth, Lord what scheikes should he haue shewe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: I am assured he should haue passed Coruet, Chalme and Trompet) how treuly this is said by him, in the end the Reader will perceaue.</p>
            <p>Now to iune with this Doctor, and susteane the part of Iames. How are ye able to imprufe this argument? All worshipping of God inuented by the braue of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie, the masse is of that nature, ergo it is Idolatrie. Let vs consider how this Sophister, new start vp out of Sorbone,<note place="margin">A bold &amp; shamles assertion of the Abbotes</note> goeth about to impugne the proposition of this Syllogisme. It is expres (sayeth he) against Gods word, for Abraham and syndrie of the Fathers had inuented way<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>es and meanes to worship God, without any commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Thus, this new Doctor playeth him with his mirrie concept, but the mater were of lyght value if he should not trauell to draw the godlie Fathers allowed, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing testimonie of the Spirite of God, into the same impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie, and so to make them as it were Authors hereof. This is the fructe that is to be loked for, of the vaine fantasies &amp; fond Ymaginations of the wicked hartes of men, when they take vpon them impudentlie the part of God. The man I can not tell what he thinkes of the mater, alwayes he reciteth no Text. Trew it is, that some Cotation is in the Margine: the 22.8. and 4. Chapitures of Geneses, places as appeareth to him so facile and pertinent, that they neid no rehearsall.</p>
            <p>In deid I will not werie to bring forthe the wordes of the Text. It is written in the 22. Chapiture the. 9. vers. When they were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ing to the place which God had shaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to him, in the which he builded vp an Alter, and laide the woode orderly, and bound Isaac his Sonne, and laide him on the Alter vpon the woode. This I take to be the place ye meane of, for there be no other in that Chapiter, whereby ye may any wise help you. Now then let vs consider how proper this Text is to the purpose.</p>
            <p>To make this Text to serue your purpose, ye will (I beleue) affirme that Abraham had no commandement so to do, yet if we consider the Text aright, there shalbe fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d an plaine commandement of God, God to be the conduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of Abraham all the way, and fynally his whole fact to be approued by the Spirite of God. The commandement
<pb facs="tcp:11:10"/>
is plaine in the Second vers. Take now thy onely sonne Isaac, whom thou louest best, and get thee to the Land of Moriah, and offer him there for and brunt offring, vpon one of the Montanes,<note place="margin">Whither Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But ye will say pereue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture, there be nothing there spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: that I deny: for it is plain that he is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded to offer him vp for an brunt o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>anded from the beginning to the Fathers, and so to haue had place from tyme to tyme, that no Sacrifice wes offered vp, but vpon an certane Alter, erected to that vse, which may euidently appeare in this, that the erection of the Alter is recited in the fact of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,<note place="margin">The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrings of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wayes o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Alters.</note> which is all whole allowed and lykewise shalbe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the fact of Noie. It is no wayes to be beleued, that this holy Father, who doeth all by the direction of faith, yea, and whose fact is altogether allowed of God, as we reid plainly in the Text the. 16. That this holy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch, I say attempteth any thing in the worke of God, without his commandement. This I trust Iames might haue replyed.</p>
            <p>In the eight Chapiter it is written. Then Noie buyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded an Alter to the Lord, and tuke of euerie clene beast, and of euerie clene foule, and offered brunt offeringes vpon the Alter. Here starteth vp our Carrick Doctor, and sayeth, Noie hath no commandement this to do. Where is the charge to buylde the Alter? To offer vp the Sacrifice?</p>
            <p>Firste if I shall ask this Doctor, if Noie had any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement to buyld the Arcke to receaue therein of all sortes of beastes, and mo of the clene, then vnclene,<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tud of the knowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the clene and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clene bea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stes, and of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance and will of God, knowen in the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into it. I think he will not deny it, yea, and that to testifie his obedience, he wold not depart out of the Arcke, till he wes commanded, and besydes this, reid we not plainely? that he wes commanded to take a greater nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the clene beastes, then vnclene? and that for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice cause? which altogether may appeare vaine. If the counsel of God herein had bene kept secrete and backe from this holy Father, who wes to be the Preist for offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vp of sacrifice. Attour Moyses sayeth plainly that the sacrifices were appointed to be of the clene beastes, wherei<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is most certane that Noie could make no defference, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:11:10"/>
yet wes it in the pleasure, or power of man, for wes it able to Noie think ye? to descerne betuix the clene, and the vnclene, and it that wes meit for Sacrifice, and it that wes not. If the Spirite of God had not this reuealed vnto him? it is not to be beleued.</p>
            <p>Shall we conclude now that this which he doeth to the praise of God, for his deliuerance and reporteth suche an testimonie of the allowance, and approbation of God, that the lyke is not giuen throughout all the Scriptures to no Sacrifice? Shal we conclude this to be done without the ordinance of God, ether by reuelation in dreame, or els by an Angel. For these were the two ordinarie meanes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God vttered his will, to his Elect and chosen: which wayes being now pretended by Papistes and Anabapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes can haue no place.

            <p>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>toure we may obserue the maner of proceading of the Spirite of God in his Scriptures, that in so farre as he is giuen to a certane sententious breuitie, he passeth by the commandement of the fact which he so earnestly alloweth, and that immediatlie after, yea, and sometymes in the precept it self, pretermitteth some circumstances of tyme, place, Alter and suchlyke, whereof after is made mention.</p>
            <p>Further do we think it to be of no authoritie and weight that which is spoken in the conclusion of the 4. Chapiter. In deid for my owne iudgement, as I moste willinglie subscriue, to the interpretation of them that hereby vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandeth the erecting of Gods trew Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore by the impietie of the tyme, and the wicked maners of men had bene suppressed and adulterated. So will I affirme that the worshipping of the eternall, wes redacted to a certane forme and ordor, not that euerie man shal do that, that doeth seme best beutiful and pleasing in his sight
<pb facs="tcp:11:11"/>
but vse him self according to the Lawes and preceptes of the Spirite of God, who is the Author &amp; modirator of all godlynes.</p>
            <p>Who then darre be so impudent or malapeart to deny this Sacrifice of Nose to be here commanded, or that it shall not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e to this forme, here spoken and mentionat? I truste none.</p>
            <p>The answers made to these two, may serue sufficiently to the refutation of it that is alledged out of the beginning of the 4. Chapiter, which is of Abell. If I should not binde and astrict my self to the answer of euerie perticulare, that this Authore hereafter shall haue no shift to auoide nor pretext to cloke his wilfull and barbarous obstinacie. The wordes are these. And in proces of tyme, it came to pas, that Cain broght an oblation to the Lord of the fruit of the ground, and Abell also him self, broght of the fructes of his shepe, and of the fat of them, and the Lorde had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect vnto Abell and his offerring, but vnto Cain and to his offerring he had no regarde.</p>
            <p>In the answer to this, where it is pretended by this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asoner, that there is no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement giuen in the Text to ether of the brethren so to do: albeit the place of the Author of the Epistle to the Hebrewes,<note place="margin">Hebr. 11.</note> may serue to the refutation hereof, yea, &amp; the Text it self new rehearseth, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Abell &amp; his work, &amp; the Author to the Hebreues, ascribing the praise of fayth vnto it.<note place="margin">Laubo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>und and reping, &amp; bringing vp of cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell by God, &amp; vertious exercises pleasing God.</note> Yet will I trauell somewhat further, and prufe by this Text, that no dout they were thus instructed by their Father. The maner &amp; kynd of lyfe which they did follow, wes no dout, godlie and laudable, for the manuring of the ground wes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of God, and prefered to all other exercise and lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boure, by the antiquitie. The feading of the Cattell wes no les honest then profitable, yea, and this whole lyfe, as it is moste simple and clene, and impolluted, so it is moste naturall. Whereof we may collect, that they did bothe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise them selues in lauboures approued of God, &amp; moste necessarie to the releif of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon vse of the lyfe of man, so that there can be no dout, but they were well instructed by their father. Seing they do exercise them selues, bothe in offerring vp of Sacrifices, so that in the lyfe of Cain, to the outward appearance, no man shall find faut, vsing himself deuly to his God, and winning sustentation, wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:11:11"/>
all leafull and honest meanes to him self and his houshold. For how shal we think that euer it should haue ascended in the gredy and wicked hart of Cain, to offer vp in Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to God, of the feuer of the ground, if the Father had not teached him? Yea, and coacted him as it were.</p>
            <p>This I think ye will not deny, but if ye ask where is the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement giuen to the Father. To answer hereto we shall rehears somepart of the Chapiter, preceading:: principally that notable and confortable sentence, where it is said. I shal put Inimitie betuix the sede of the Serpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and the sede of the woman, he shall break thy head, &amp; thou shal bruse his heill. in the which wordes, no dout, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of the Sauioure is conteined, and the meanes signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whereby Saluation wes to be procured vnto man, and that by the Sacrifice of his death, whereof all Sacrifices were figures.</p>
            <p>Do we then think that God, hauing thus rased vp ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, from the pit and the goulf of death, giuing to him some cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane smelling of lyfe, being new casten out of paradise, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing lost the syght and contemplation of that tree which wes a Sacrament vnto him, and a pledge of immortalitie,<note place="margin">The tree of lyfe in paradise, wes a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of imm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ortalytie</note> do we not think (I say) that he appointed him these ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie exercises of Sacrifices, whereby they might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teaned in continuall remembrance and protection,<note place="margin">The Sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>crifices were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But here
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:11:13"/>
we may mark it to be trew that is commonly said, one er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror engenders an other. The ignorance &amp; misknowledge of this, casteth you, Sire, into an greater and more gros error.</p>
            <p>Trew it is, that Cornelius wes a Gentile, and did many good workes acceptable to God, no dout, but that your argument may procead, ye haue to proue that they were done without the commandement of God, which ye are not able, nor all your ignorant, wicked and vngodly sect: for the Spirit of God pronounceth plainely that he wes a religious man, &amp; fearing God with all his whole hous, so that he hath expres testimonie to haue bene instructed in the Law of God, of the Reuelation and comming of the Messias promised, and Saluation proceading of him, and to haue teached the same to all his hous. Now I truste ye are not able to proue any thing done by Cornelius, but by the commandement of God.</p>
            <p>But all your sayinges being moste fals, ye assume them without any probation, It appeareth that ye haue bene so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mered with the mater ye had interprysed, to refell, that ye cared not how to pas by it, so ye myght appeare to the Reader, to haue done somthing not vnlyke to the wower,<note place="margin">The ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bote is lyke a wower in this sclande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers.</note> who hauing bene a while in hous with a yong maiden, &amp; she now ready to be contracted with an other in mariage, rather then he should be called the blaite louer, be sclande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the damisel. Yet am I not lytle conforted in this, that ye make (good, and acceptable to God) to be of equal and of a value, a thing, euer denyed by the Sophisters and scoole men. Take head that they be not be the eares with you, for this, and conceaue some opinion of Apostasie and defection, as ye ar a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in deid that can direct your cours to the winde, if ye should not be caryed away with the winde of ambition and pryde.</p>
            <p>Thus, this subtle reasoner concludeth the oppugnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Maior, putting a defference betuix the workes that be done of a good zeal, against the commandement of God, &amp; such as are done with a good intent,<note place="margin">The ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bote try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umpheth befor the victorie.</note> without the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God.

haue said shortly this proposition is erronious, and nedeth no refutation, and to haue proceadeth to the assumption. This maner of reasoning, albeit it may seene to refell any thing that will be alledged by Thome armors men in the contrare: yet think not that ye will blind the eyes of such as may abyde the Sonne, and are tryed thereby.</p>
            <p>And therefore Sire, yet we say to repeat the su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me of the whole in few wordes, that all worshipping of God, inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

I am assured that the holy instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of circumcision is so tearmed by the Spirite of God, the pashoner lykewise: the Sacrifices appointed in the boke of Leui, as they by their cerimonies and oblations, are distinguished one from an other, so euerie one hath their own proper name, which no man durst alter, change or innouate. In the new Testament the lyke to be prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised by the same Spirite, it is moste euident. Is not the Sacrament of our regeneratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> called Baptisme? and that moste properlie: the holie action of our Sauiour,<note place="margin">Cor. 10.11.</note> at the Table, before his departing from his Apostles, in the which he gaue bread and wine, the verie signes and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens, yea, the verie pledges of his body and blood,<note place="margin">The whole action of Christ at the table that night he wes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed, hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per by it self.</note> is not this action called somtymes the Communion, somtymes the Lordes Supper, and such other appellations, drawen furth of the Scriptures, as the Sacrament of his body &amp; blood, and of thankesgeuing.</p>
            <p>This then being cleir, that there is no institution in the old, nor yet i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the new Testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but as moste faythfully &amp; cairfully the ceremonies, the rytes and the maner of them are declared, so shal we obserue the names to be moste pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlie attrybuted vnto them. For this we may eissally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue, the trauell and studie of the Spirite of God to be, that as the ordinances of God are moste clene and holy in them selues, so they be exempted from all matche &amp; patch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the foolish imagination of mans hart.

This is mirrie to refresh the reader, and yet is moste trew, for this wicked and deuillish opinion of remission of snies by masse, hath enuennomed all Christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and drowned it vp so, that she allone wes esteamed to be the lady, the plyght and souerane Anchor, yea, and the porte of all benediction and Saluation. What blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie and derogation, to the blood of Iesus Christ? To his dignitie, honor and preisthead, hath proceaded hereof? as it is now manifest to euerie one, so in the refutatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this, we are driuen to speak somwhat.

            </p>
            <p>We knowe that the Author to the Hebreues, Vendicates the dignitie of preisthead, wholy to our Sauioure, whose preisthead he calleth there.<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> that is to say, of that nature, that it can not be transferred into an other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:11:17"/>The argument of the Apostle is verie cleir, in the 7. Chap. where he giues the cause of the multytude &amp; plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of preistes, euerie one succedinge other,<note place="margin">Hebr. 7.</note> because they were mortal and subiect to death, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d so could not remane.<note place="margin">Why in the olde Lawe ther wes many Preistes</note> But no such infirmitie falleth in our preist the Lord Iesus who hath offered vp him self in a ful satisfaction and reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, for all our sinnes and that ones, the vertue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of remaneth perpetually, and yet desisteth not to execute the other parte of the office of the preist, euer interreading at his Fathers handes, for the offences of the people, euer liuing as the Apostle sayeth, for that cause. How then can this Sacrifice stand without a preist? How can there be any oblation without a Sacrificer?<note place="margin">There is no shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of blood in the masse and there<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore no remissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of sinnes</note>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, we be plainely teached by this same author that there can be no remission of sinnes without effusion &amp; shedding of blood. In your masse there is no shedding of blood, for ye call it on vnbloody Sacrifice: but how iustly after shalbe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidered. How then darre ye promise to your selues remission of sinnes thereby.</p>
            <p>Thridly, if ye will pertinatiouslie insist, and will it to be a Sacrifice, necessarly it shal follow, that it that is offer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red shalbe slaine. If Christ be Sacrificed in euerie masse, then shal he be moste barbarously and cruelly slaine euerie day, in ten thousand places, for ye affirme plainely,<note place="margin">If Christ be offered in euerie masse, as the papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes say, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> must he be sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine euery day, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue a thousand tymes.</note> that ye offer him vp vnto his Father. This is not myne, but the Apostles argument in the same Epistle, if it had bene neid<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full to him to haue offered him self ofter then ones, then should he haue suffered oftentymes, since the beginning of the world. It followeth then cleirly that since ye take v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon you to offer him vp at all tymes in euerie corner, that ye do that, that is in you to put traterous and blody han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des vpon him. Your shiftes and subterfuges are well knowene to me, firste that ye christ not successors to our Sauioure, as if he were dead and vtterly taken away, but suffraganes of his Eternall preisthead. But if the wordes of the Apostle be well examinat and considdered aryght, they do proue manifestly, that nether neadeth he a succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor nor yet a suffragane, seing he is euer leuing, and ready to execute, yea, and executing his office, euer present with his Church, and neuer intermitting the office laide vpon him by his Father. And this his Sacrifice he dide ones offer vp, by vertue whereof remission of sinnes is obtened,
<pb facs="tcp:11:18"/>
to all that beleued. In the office of intercession, he is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually occupyed, as we haue somwhat touched, so that in no part of his office, can he be ether esteamed sleuthful, absent or so occupied to require a Suffragane, ether yet mortal and subiect to death, that he should neid a successor.</p>
            <p>Hereby I trust it be sufficiently declared, your masse to be no Sacrifice, and so your diffinition to fal in that point, and so haue ye to lybell new againe.<note place="margin">The papistes subteltie &amp; deceat in taking away one part of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</note> To that ye say the Lordes body is really conteined vnder the formes of bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad and wyne, I wonder ye make no mention of the blood of our Lorde aswell, as of the Body, but in this ye shaw well where ye learned, to wit, at Sorbone, and not at the Scoole of Christe: for Christe instituteth and vseth two seuerall simboles of his body &amp; blood, bread &amp; wyne, but you as ye are teached of your maister Sathan; doeth think that, nawise neidfull. In token whereof ye haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred all Christianes, except a certane shauelinges, from the one part of the Lordes table, and hath reserued the cuppe all whole to your selues, and in deid, God be prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, it is not euill sent vpon their boched faces. Albeit that Iesus Christ the Author hereof doeth plainely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that all shall drink, and this wes euer practised in the primitiue Church, yea, and euer reteined by the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fathers, howsoeuer ye take vpon you, in your stink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diffinition, that it wes so instituted by our Sauioure, in remembrance of his death and passion: so lyghtly not onely do ye pas by the holy ordinances of God, but also the shedding of his blood.</p>
            <p>In the Second diffinition which appeareth to conteine a certane correction of the former,<note place="margin">Ane an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d diffinitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the masse.</note> Ye call it a commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and remembrance of Christes death and passion.

But the masse to be that action, ether yet to haue any affinitie with it, being alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether als contrarious as the heauen and the earth, lyght and darknes, the day and the nyght, he is more nor mad, that tholeth hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so to be persuaded.

shall atteane to that place, where of set purpose, you do handle the aggreance of the masse with the Lordes table, and the diuersitie. Where ye pretend the bread &amp; the wyne to be consecrated (execrated I darre say boldly for conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration haue ye none) according to Christes institution.<note place="margin">In the masse there is nothing-lyke the Lordes Supper.</note> I trust there be none that euer hath sene the action of the Lord Iesus practysed, ether yet hath red the wordes of his moste blissed institution, that will consent or aggre thereto, for in his action we read plainely, that he take bréad, gaue thankes, brake it, gaiue it vnto his Apostles, and lykewise did with the Cuppe. In your masse, what is lyke this? First there is no thankes geuing, or any that can be pretended, since it is in a forrane language, it is eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as there were none: there is no breaking of bread,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.23.</note> nether yet distribution. What can it haue then lyke vnto the Lordes institution?</p>
            <p>To the offerring vp of the body and blood of Iesus Christe, vnder the formes of bread and wyne to the father of heauen, I am assured there is no such thing in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of our Sauiour, shaw your warrand, produce your commission, the action I haue rehearsed, wherein there is no such thing to the iudgement of all.

But to what end shal we dispute with you of consecration: which we reid not in the wordes of our Sauioure, nether yet geueth he any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement so to do to his Apostles and Church.</p>

            <p>We know, and I truste it be not vnknowen to you, that the ordinances of God consisteth in two pointes, the commandement and the promise, as in the mater of prayers,<note place="margin">Psal. 50.</note> cal vpon me in the day of thy trouble, and I shal here thee, the commandement is geuen to cal vpon God, the promise is annexed: I shall here thee, if thou shall break this commandement, darre thou, or can thou assure thy self of the promise that is to be hard of God?

So that there is no defference betuix that action, that wes then practised by our Sauioure, and it that is now done to his imitation by vs, we but haue the place of ministers, it is he that sanctifieth and changeth, that is to say, it is he by whose ordinance and commandement, this whole action is hallowed and sanctified. For the action it self, if it shalbe considered, it shall seme and appeare ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie vile and of no price, yet seing there is nothing done, but at his commandement, practised by him self, allowed by him, we as becometh well instructed Children, doeth iudge it to be worthy of all reuerence, whereof we haue his warrand, being commanded so to do, in remembrance of him till he come.</p>

            <p>But least thou shal insist vpon the latter word of chang<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing:<note place="margin">what the ancentis vnderst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and by changi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g in the sacrame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.</note> I will trauell to oppen vp the mynde of the moste Ancient Fathers in that part: for they do vse that worde often, not to signifie any such change, as ye fondly haue deuised and inuented: but onely willing hereby, that we should all, before that we shall offer and present our selues to this table, consider the dignitie, praise and prerogatiue of this heauenly banked, that we be here called to, where the same is the banked, and the banked giuer, as this same Author sayeth. We shall consider this bread, exhibited to vs here, to be the bread of lyfe,<note place="margin">Christ is boith the bankede and the bankede giuer.</note> nourishing our Soules vnto immortalitie. We shall consider these Elementes which he giuen, as sure pledges of eternall Saluation, and of all benefites procured and obteined to vs by Iesus Christe.</p>
            <p>So that we must not go to this table, as to a common table, to farce and stuffe our bellies with bread and wyne, but we muste vnderstand this bread to be seperated from the common vse, and sainctified and dedicated to the holy Communion of Christes body and blood,<note place="margin">We must consider the brad a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d wyne in the ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to be dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to an holy are vse then to feade oure bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</note> to declare to vs that we are not now leuing in our selues, but Christe le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth and rigneth in vs, we are no more the seruandes and slaues of Sathan, but members of Iesus Christe, that we are now made participant and partakers, of his iustice and ryghteousnes: and that by him we haue remission of our sinnes, so that now albeit we be in the earth exposed to all kynde of tentation, trouble, and persecution, yet our conuersation is in the heauen with him, on whome our Soules stayeth and feadeth.</p>
            <p>This change then that they do meane of, is to extoll this mysterie as it is worthy all praise, and declare with what trymbling, feare and humilitie, we oght to present our selues thereto, because this that wes common bread, appointed for the refection of mans body, is now sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to an holy vse, to assure vs of that coniunction, yea, and liuely perticipation we haue now, with the Eternall Sonne of God, who ioyneth him self so familiarly with vs, that we are now ingrafted so in him, that we now, as it were soucketh our verie substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, out of his body &amp; blood He is now vnto vs, that, that he called him self the wyne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tre, and we the brenches, he is the head, and we the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,

he is shortlie he, out of whome lyfe, ryghteousnes, iustice, holynes, and sanctification, proceadeth and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vnto vs.</p>
            <p>So that this whole change and immutation, is to be referred to the myndes and consciences of the receauers,<note place="margin">The cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>And in this whole institution, ones made by him self, he still sanctifieth for euer, the Sacramentall Simboles, to the perpetuall vse and confort of the whole Churche: which this Author Chrisostome signifieth moste clearlie, In that he sayeth: he that wroght then in the Supper, doeth them euen now, so that he still sanctifieth them, by his holy institution and ordinance, that he made then in the Suppere, where he changed not the substance of bread and wyne, but the naturall vse appointed to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>section of our bodies, he turned and conuerted in a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall vse, to serue vs by the inwarde operation of the Spirite of God, to the nourishement of our Soules, and vpholding of our Faith.</p>
            <p>Ones he said: this is my body, this cuppe is the new Testament in my blood, do this in remembrance of me.

            <p>Whereof lykewise we may collect, that there wes no preuy masses, such as in our dayes, &amp; in the aige of our forebiers (that hath bene vnder Antichristes authoritie, moste pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanely abused) hath bene: preuy masses I call all suche, where as the preist (the people wholy secluded) without any distribution, deuoreth &amp; swelloweth vp all in a moste reuinus maner, as in all masses we haue sene: which as they are contrarius to the ordinances of Christe Iesus, so moste iustlie they lacke, and hath no testimonie nor appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of antiquitie, but are moste impius, blasphemus,<note place="margin">Sathan him self could ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uer so im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tlie wr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the first word of the promise, where demonstration is made of the bread, but apperteaneth to the latter word (body).<note place="margin">It was not the bread but Chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stes natu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ral body that was broken for vs</note> For speaking of the bread, he sayeth, he brake it, and he gaue it to his Disciples, and not for his Disciples, now meaning of his passion, and that his body wes to suffer, which is (sayeth he) broken for you, as to the tyme we haue not to be curius, for we knowe the Spirite of God, somtymes in declaring that, that is vndoutedly to be, ether a long tyme, or immediatly after, to vse the present tyme, yea, and the tyme passed.

            <p>But I pray thee, where shal we finde in these wordes, such an vnbloody Sacrifice, as thou here bringeth in? I am assured the breaking of Christes body wes bloody, and moste cruel: where lykewise shall we finde this oblation?
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:11:26"/>
For there is no mention of oblacion in this whole action, nether yet did our Sauiour offer any thing there, nor yet to his Disciples giueth he any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement to offer, but simplie willeth vs to do this in remembrance of him, which is relatiue to the whole action before practysed, of taking bread, thankes geuing, breaking of it, and distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution to be made, here is neuer a sillabe of offering.</p>
            <p>Well, let vs go to the probation, which is drowen out of Malachy the Prophet, and his first Cha. the wordes are <q>I haue no pleasure of you, sayeth the Lorde, and as for the meat offering I will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it at your hand, for from the rysing vp of the Sone, and to the going doune of the same My Name is great amonges the Gentiles, yea, in euerie place shal the Sacrifice be done, and an cleane oblacion offered vp vnto my Name, for my Name is great amonges the Gentiles.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here I may haue occasion to speak somwhat of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters faithfulnes, who thinketh it nothing to turne by the future tyme, that which is spoken in the present, for I am assured that all the textes that euer I did se, Hebrew Greik, Latine, Englishe, French, hath the word in the present (is Sacrificed) and not (shalbe) and (an cleane oblation is offered) &amp; not (shalbe) but I will pas by that followeth in this Doctor.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Mark sayeth he, the wordes of the Prophet, and ye shall perceaue that they are not spoken of the Sacrifice of the Lordes body, offered vp vpon the croice. For why the Sacrifice of the Lordes body on the croice, was onely in Ierusalem, and the wordes of the Prophet speaketh of a Sacrifice offered vp in euerie place, and so furth.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Where this Author trauelleth, by an argument that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e call in the Scooles <hi>A sufficiente enumeratione partium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:11:27"/>that is, when as we euert euerie particulare, to confirme and establishe an certane thing, but as this argument lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not the strenth, when as all is properly euerted, so if any thing be pretermitted, ether yet improperly handled it proceadeth not.</p>
            <p>Now to the matter, of the Sacrifice of the Lordes body on the croice (say ye) it can not be vnderstand, for it wes onely in Ierusalem. I know that our Sauiour wes cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified in Ierusalem. Yet what shalbe the cause that it shall not be lefull to vs to speak as the Apostle Paule in the. 3. to the Galth. where he plainely witnesseth that our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oure wes crucified amonges them.<note place="margin">Gala. 3.</note> Why shal the same li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie be denyed to all places, where the death of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour hath bene, or is lyuelie preached? Which no dout, hath bene euerie where, lyke as the Prophet testifieth, in the. 19. Psalme,<note place="margin">Psal. 19.</note> and the holy Goste speaketh of Paule, appointing him to beare the name of Iesus, to the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moste partes of the earth.</p>
            <p>Why then may we not expound this saying of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, of the Sacrifice and oblation of the body of Iesus Christe, seing he is euerie where crucified,<note place="margin">How Christ is said to be crucified i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> wheresoeuer his Euangel is treuly preached. And as touching thy stin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and filthy masse, it hath bene (God be preased) at all tymes included and circumscribed within a certane boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, and that verie small.</p>
            <p>But thou will say pereuentur, that the speaking of the Apostle is metaphoricall. What if I shal say the same of the wordes of the Prophet?<note place="margin">Euen as the Apls wordes may be ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally like<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wyse the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes sain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</note> For if he admonisheth vs of any thing to be erected after the abrogation of the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Lawe, no dout, he speaketh so by the fygures, then vsed in the Lawe, that thereby we should vnderstand an other sort of worshipping to be pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, and receaued in place of those fygures. Thus thru the speaking can not be proper. but alwayes metaphoricall from the vmber &amp; shoddowe to expres the veritie. And thus may we haue the sense of the wordes of the Prophet properly that euerie where is there an oblation or Sacrifice offered vp in my Name, that is the Sacrifice of my Eternall and onely Sonne, wherewith I am all whole co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plesed and delyred, is offered vp vnto me, that is preached, for whatsoeuer way thou can apply this saying to thy masse, that same way shall I proue that it conueneth, and more iustly to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:11:27"/>
the predication of the Euangel, and death of our Sauiour. For where thou restreines his death to the towne of Ierusalem, so will I affirme of the institution of his holy Supper, out of the which thou soucketh moste i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eptly and impiusly thy fond masse. If thou will insist and say that the masse is done euerie where, I answer the same of the Sacrifice of Christes body more treuly. If thou shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply yet, that, that is onely by preaching. I answer, that first thy masse hath nothing to do with the Lordes table, and besydes that the Author of the holy Supper, did ones sanctifie this action, which remaneth for euer, as I haue shawen heretofore, as our Sauiour died ones, &amp; willeth his death to be preached euerie where, and so consequently to be crucified in all places, according to the metaphorical speaking of the Apostle as I haue already declared.</p>
            <p>Now I pray you good Reader perceaue with me the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of this new Author, the strenth of his argumentes, and the forme of his proceadinges. Secondly ye go about to proue that the sayinges of the Prophet. <q>Can not be vnderstand of the wordes of the Iowes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the wordes doeth plainely declaire, that all their Sacrifices wer repudiat by the Lord God, from the tyme that the Lordes bodie wes offered vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> croice.</q> This ferre our Author.</p>
            <p>First if I should repugne, how shal ye be able to proue, that here we be forewarned of any Sacrifice to be erected in the new Testament? of the abolishment of the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the Lawe, and the institution of this your explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Sacrifice of the masse, which ye continually flatter and beare in hand? For in this place there is no prophecie but a sharpe rebuke &amp; reprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sion of the sacrificers vnder the Lawe who, by their horrible &amp; haynous sines, did so ki<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dle the wraith of God against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that he moste iustly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaneth of them in this place,<note place="margin">Iere. 7.</note> lyke as he doeth i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the firste Chap. of Isayas, reiecting their Sacrifices, Prayers, fastinges, with al the rest of their Pompus workes,<note place="margin">Psam. 50</note> wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of they did so much brage, so that here there is nothing els but the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon querimonie of al the Prophetes, to wit, that he declareth their Sacrifices in no wayes to be acceptable vnto God, but altogether abhominable in his presence,
<pb facs="tcp:11:28"/>
because of their filthy and vicius lyfe.</p>
            <p>For the reule is generally prescribed by Moyses, that God did first luke to Abell, and then to his gyftes. And it is more nor euident, that of the horrible and proude con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temuer, he doeth not receaue, no not his owen most holy ordinances: so that the whole thing that is here rehearsed may be moste properly applyed to the shame, rebuke, and vtter exterminion of these filthy massemongers, and of all that is offered by them, whose Sacrifices, albeit they were appointed and allowed of God, as were those of the Lawe (as in verie deid they be not, but altogether are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable in his presence, nether hauing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement nor approbation of him) yet are they of no value, yea, I say moste odius in Gods presence, by the plaine testimonie of the Prophet here. So that I meruell not lytle of these masked Asses, that alledgeth ignorantly this place for the prufe and confirmation of this whore moste iustly reiected of all them that are not blinded with Sathan.</p>
            <p>God here in plaine tearmes pronounceth, that he is in no wayes appleased in them, he will receaue no gift of their handes, so that he receaueth not the oblatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of their handes, whose condicions &amp; maners are haitful to him. He is not contented with the Sacrifices and oblations of the Iewes, being institute and commanded, earnestlie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired and authorised of him? Not that God is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and appleased with that, that he commandeth, but that the Sacrificers did not offer them of that mynde, but of a mere hypocrisie did they vse and practise them, and turne them to a certane lucre againe, and aduantage for them selues.</p>
            <p>Now let vs conuert this querimonie of the Prophet vnto our Sacrificers, do ye not think that the Eternall may say the same,<note place="margin">The pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ncipall cause of the masse and of all heresie is the gredy belly</note> my pleasure is not in you, I wil receaue no gift of your handes, seing their filthy liues, their aua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rixius and gredie practises, their whole studies and thogh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes are giuen to ambition and lucre, in such rage, that as our eyes abhorreth the sight of it, so doeth the tounge shrinke to expres it. I truste, that not onely by the iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement of the world, may it be prouen, but by the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of your owen consciences ye may be conuicted, all that be of you Sacrificers, to referre all, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to Sacrifice wholy for your Belly, that is the mother (as Ieronimus doeth

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4</note> that albeit that God be not appleased with you, yet the Sacrifice that ye do offer, is pleasing, to wit, the body, and blood of Iesus Christe is acceptable.</p>
            <p>But if God should answer, and say, I know, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth my Sonne, he is be in whom I am pleased, I haue placed and deposed with him the thesaures of my wisdome, power, mercy and goodnes. But what be ye? Who gaue you any such commission? He offered him self according to my determination and Eternal Council, for the sinnes of the world, for satisfaction to my ryghteous iudgement, and for the reconciliation of man to me: but who required that ye should offer him vp againe? But in deid good Maister, if this place of the Prophet shalbe thus applyed to your Idole masse, I perceaue well ye do it vpon a great policy, for one of your principall thinges ye brage of (but how iustly it shalbe after examinat) is a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiquitie, thus ye shall haue your holy Idole much oulder nor ye take it to be, and to haue bene practised in the tyme of Malachias, for I am assured that all that is there spok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, is in the present tyme, as I haue warned you hearto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.<note place="margin">Harken ye papist<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>es your masse is olderthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ye know</note> And besydes this ye shall haue an vniuersalitie for this that is spoken of there, is said to be euerie where, in all places. This how iustly may be said of your masse let the wise and prudent Reader consider. I am assured, that the masse wes, nether so oulde as Malachias, nor yet that it wes so vniuersally receaued, that it wes published and authorised euerie where, and so pas thy way with thy vanities and fond imaginations, and search some other place, to confirme and establish thy wicked opinion,<note place="margin">The wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des of Ie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rome ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pounding this pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce alledg<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed by the papists out of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <q>It is trew that Christe was offered vp vpon the croies, and is neuer to be offered vp againe after that maner, as ane bludie Sacrifice, and it is trew that the Lordes body is offered vp after ane vther maner in the Sacrifice of the ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Let all be red that is written by Mathew, Mark, Luck, and Paule, of the holie Supper, and moste diligently and manifestly conferred and considered, if our Sauioure i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his latter Supper, offered his body and blood, vnto God the Father, and commanded that we should do the same, he brake bread, gaue thankes, distributed it to his Discip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, saying: take ye, eat ye, this is my body, which is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for you. He did lykewise with the Cuppe, saying, take, drink of it all, this Cuppe is the new Testament in my blood, which shalbe shed for you and many, vnto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinnes, adiecting to bothe the partes, do this in remembrance of me. What is here, I pray you, that may in any wise apperteane to the oblation of the body and blood of our Sauioure, to be made in the masse?</p>
            <p>For we know that the oblation of his body wes made, and his blood shed the day following. And I truste that no man wil think or say, that he commanded vs to do that thing in remembrance of him, which he did the day imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly ensewing, but that he willed them to do that, that he then practised, to the perpetuall recordation and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie of him, without any further commandement.<note place="margin">The Apo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stle sayth playnlie, that wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hout ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of blood the<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re wes no obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioun for Sinne.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Thus then thou can pretend no commandement, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer thou shall brage of it. Secondly, we are plainely teached by the Author to the Hebrewes, that the oblation of the body and blood of Iesus Christe is of that nature, that ones perfected vpon the croice, it can in no wayes be reiterate nor made againe.</p>
            <p>Christe in offerring vp himself, died and rose againe, &amp; thus is no more subiect to mortalitie, and we know that there can be no oblation vnto remission of sinnes, but it that is by effusion of blood. So that now, whosoeuer go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth about to offer vp him againe, they do that is in them to crucifie him of new.</p>
            <p>Is not the argument of the Apostle, moste euident and
<pb facs="tcp:11:33"/>
strenthy, shawing the excellency of our Sacrifice of the new Testament aboue them of the olde, in that, that they not onely were many and oftentymes repeated, yea, euen the self same, by long continuance of tyme, till they were altogether abolished, where as we haue but one, and that ones offered, neuer to be reiterated nor offered againe.</p>
            <p>Iudge with thy self, if that be not the introducting and establishing of a new iudaisime, shaw me the defference, thay had a certane Sacrifice, which in consideration of the inhabilytie, wes oftentymes reiterate, &amp; in no wayes had bene repeated, if it should haue had sufficient force and strenth,<note place="margin">The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuixt the sacrifice of the old and new testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t</note> what shalbe of the Sacrifice of the croice? Sall it not be accused of imperfection and inhabilitie, thus rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate by you. Further we know, that Christe can not be offered of none, but of him self, being the onely Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator betuix God and ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, neuer hauing resigned ouer this dignitie to none.</p>
            <p>Attour, what a monstrus and preposterus thing shall this be, that the oblation, that is the thing that is offered, shalbe more worthy, and of greater value and estimation, then the offerer, more acceptable to God, nor he that doeth offer it, which of a necessitie must follow, if a shaueling shall offer vp Christe in his masse.</p>
            <p>Moyses doeth teach vs, the oblation to be receaued of God, for his saike that doeth offer it, for the oblation of Cain wes reiected of God for Cain saike, and the gift of Abell receaued not for the owen cause,<note place="margin">The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes bringing vp a Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daisime, make the sacrifice of Christ imꝓfyte.</note> but the saike of the offerer, lyke as is plaine through all the Prophetes, so we haue in this mater, the oblation of the body and blood of Iesus Christe, to be moste pleasant vnto the Father, in consideration that it wes offered vp, by his onely and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beloued Sonne. By these argumentes it may appeare euidently, the vanitie of thy pretended commandement, &amp; captius distinctions, which in your owen doctrine inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, a verie great contradiction. For ye do call this your fond oblation an vnbloodie Sacrifice, if I had presently a notare at hand, I should bestowe an plack vpon an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of this saying.</p>
            <p>I ask of thee new diuine, how can this be an vnbloody Sacrifice, and yet thou wil affirme the wyne, that is their drunke by the Preist, to be the verie reall blood of our Sauiour Christe, that he receaued of the substance of the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:11:33"/>
Virgine, and that he shed vpon the croice. The Sacrifice of the croice is called bloody, because Christes blood wes shed thereon, in verie deid, shall not this your Sacrifice be the same argument be bloodie, since ye drink and offre vp the same blood that vpon the croice wes shed.<note place="margin">The Papistis affirme that they drink in their masses, the blood of Christ and yet they call it an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloodye sacrifice.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Now ether must thou renunce and recant the wicked error of transubstantiation, or els thou shalt, will you or will you not, grant it to be a bloodie Sacrifice, that thow so stifly denyeth &amp; haeth no otherway to declyne the pithe of the argument.

            <p>
               <q>And hereupon ye take occasion to declaire the difference betuix the Sacrifice of the Lordes body on the croice, and the Sacrifice of the masse, quhilk in sume part aggreis, and sum part defferis, firste they aggre in so far as the self same body in substance, and so furth.<note place="margin">ad cloke with tre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uth is al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>way is scabrus and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane.</note>

            </p>
            <p>The su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me of the whole is, that the Sacrifice of the massee hath thre thinges co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon with the Sacrifice of the croice, whereof the two former be sufficiently entreated, refelled and prouen, that nether is the same body in the masse, that wes offered vp vpon the croice, nor yet that the masse in any wayes wes forewarned by the Prophetes, and so wil
<pb facs="tcp:11:34"/>
I omit those two partes, least I should seme to do againe, as lyeth in the Prouerb, that, that is already done, and will ioyne in with the thrid, which is this.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Thridly, (say ye) thay aggre that lyke as the Sacrifice of the croice wes prefigurat be mony diuers signes and figures, so was the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the masse prefigurat be the preisthead and oblation of Melchisedec.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In this I glaidly go with you, that the Sacrifice of the croice wes prefigurat in the Lawe, yea, and before the written Lawe, in the Sacrifices offered by the Fathers, which did cheiflie serue to the exercise of their faith, teaching and leading them, as it were by the hand, to the Sacrifice of Iesus Christe, to be offered vpon the croice, which wes moste liuely prefigured by the Immolation of Isaac.</p>
            <p>But that there be any fygur or adumbration of thy fond Sacrifice of the masse, or forewarning, to the allowance of it, that I vtterly refuse and constantlie denye.

               </gap> and so vsed him self liberally tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes Abraham and his Armie.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as preist, according to the deutie and office of the preist he blissed him. Trew it is, that in the common Latine translatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there is some difference from the Hebrew in that he sayeth (<hi>Erat enim:</hi> for he wes) geuing as it wer a cause of the fact of Melchisedec before rehearsed, of the refreshing of Abraham and his folkes. And this no dout hath giuen the occasion to the vnlearned of stumbling, but the Hebrew is plaine, <hi>Et erat:</hi> and he wes preist of the moste heigh God, &amp; so that clause <hi>Et erat Sacerdos altiss. dei.</hi> apperteaneth not to the fact preceading, but to the office of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:11:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the preist, recyted immediatly after, of the blissing of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, in the name of the Lord of heauen. Thus Melchisedec being King and preist, no dout, wes the liuely type and figure of the preisthead of our Sauiour, ioyned with his kingdome, as Dauid doeth forewarne and teach vs in the 110. Psalme,<note place="margin">Psal. 110</note> and the Apostle in the .7. Chap. to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes, where he at lenth and of purpose declareth this mater. Wherefore I will not trauel any more in the expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of that place, but will send the Reader to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of God, declaring it at lenth by the mouth of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Apostle.</p>
            <p>I know that Tertuliane, and some of the Ancients wil seme somwhat subtile, in the explication of this Text, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting vpon the bread and the wyne, and the application thereof, to this that we do practise in the Lordes Table. But I pray you, what a sleuth should this be, in the holie Apostle of Iesus Christe, in the explication of this mater, to pas this point, if it should haue in any wise belonged to the purpose, &amp; specially seing in speaking of the preisthead (&amp; that at large &amp; of purpose he touched it not) what a gros obliuion should it be, to pas the cheif &amp; pri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cipal Sacrifice,wherein the vertue of the preisthead is included to your erronius iudgement. By the benediction &amp; the receauing of the teindes onely, cleane leauing out your foolish new inuented offering, he proueth his honour and dignitie.</p>
            <p>But this offering of bread and wyne, wherein (as ye say) wes prefigured the Sacrifice of the bodie and blood of Christe, which is the verie lyfe of the world, had bene a mater more pertinent to the Apostles purpose and intent, then any that he there alledged, if it were trew (as is most fals) that ye alledge.</p>
            <p>Here we may clearly espy, that the Ancients can not be altogether excused nor defended in this point.

because therein ye susteane no substance to remaine, but the onely accidentes. Attour, what temeritie and foolish boldnes shall this be, to giue the body of Christe to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered vp of a shaueling, seing that the onely successor to Melchiseder, is our Sauiour Christe, without any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, collaterall, successor, or suffragane.</p>
            <p>Now pas thy way and search the argument els where, for thy masse i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no wayes hath any affinitie with the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fice of the croice, in the pointes rehearsed.

            <p>Now ye discend to declaire vnto vs the defferences and disagrement of the one, with the other, and firste <q>That they deffer, that the Lordes body was offered vp vpon the croice in the awin forme, visible and sensible, and the Lordes body in the Sacrifice of the masse, is offered vp vnder the formes of bread and wyne, inuisiblie and insensable, so they deffer in maner and forme of offering vp, and not in substance.</q>

            <p>This is then the application thou meaneth of hert, for this is the doctrine of thy mother, the Romane Church, as I am able to proue, by the moste esteamed writers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monges you, which say in plaine tearmes: that the preist may pairte and distribute these graces <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>, shame, and blasphemie, that lyeth in them, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the Reader shall now shortly consider with me.</p>
            <p>Firste<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> seing we darre not attempt, nor oght to take vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hand nothing, but that we be assured of the allowance o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> God. I wold inquire of them, whereas this office appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them, to offer vp Christe to God the Father, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the merite of his death, together with all other graces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and benefites, at their pleasure and appetite (which is the hiest mater and of greatest importance in all the polycie &amp; gouernment of the Church) where is this commandemen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> giue by Iesus Christe, ether yet practised by his disciples.</p>
            <p>Secondly, how shall we take this to be a propitiatorie Sacrifice, meriting and procuring such hie and excellent giftes and graces, which onely is deuised by the fantasie of man, and whereof there is neuer a word in the Scriptures of God, conforme to the which, we acknowledge an Sacri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fice of the croice, whereby we haue grace, remission of our sinnes, restitution to Gods fauor, Redemption and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. Consider in what estimation we haue our God, and what roume and prerogatiue we ascribe to man, if he shall vsurpe and take vpon him to make such Sacrifices at his owen appetite, which shall obteane and merite all thinges to him, shall subdew the Eternall God to the pleasure of a filthy whoremonger, taking vpon him the dispensation of the benefites of God. Is not this to make man redemer of him self? To spoile God of his owen ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and dignitie? To subiect God to the will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of man? And fynally, not onelie to absence and demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>she, but vtterly to deface and quenche the whole glorie &amp; virtew of the death of our Sauiour.</p>
            <p>We know and teach, that the minister preacheth the word,<note place="margin">The doc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trine of the trew &amp; faithful minist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</note> annunceth the Sermon of peace, and confort, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistereth &amp; dispenseth the Sacramentes: but the geuing of the inwarde grace, the increas and augmentation of it, we reserue all whole to the Spirite of God, who apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and distrybuteth to euerie man, at his good pleasure, the merite of the Sacrifice of the croice, together with all
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:11:39"/>
other giftes.</p>
            <p>If it should be demanded of these gay teachers, if any massemonger preist did euer pearish or wes condemned.<note place="margin">Filthy &amp; detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phimers ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neuer confesse the king<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome of God.</note> I truste they should answer quickly, no, for how can it come to pas, that a preist, who by the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>bling of a masse, may conques and obteane the rewarde of the Eternal lyfe, that this man shal pearish? who may in the space of a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an houre, apply Saluation to him self: this man I say, can not but streight go to heauen, yea, long before his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aid vulgarly.</p>
            <p>Secondly, since it is in the will of the preist, to apply the virtew of this Sacrifice, to whome shall lyke him, specially for the redemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Soules, what is the cause of Trentales of masses, and fundations made for the soule of any certane man, seing he may be redeamed &amp; deliuered by me. I know therebe some stations i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Rome, which giueth that power and priuiledge to any man,<note place="margin">What power some sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Rome, haue by the pope.</note> by the saying of the Lordes prayer, and the beleue, to deliuer any a soule out of Purgatorie, why is there now any masse said for this soule: I know that the Pope selleth the same priuiledge, as we haue sene in our dayes, and I am able to produce the exemple, if the tyme should suffer, or were otherwayes neidful. Besydes, what moneth them to sing many masses yea, and continew them dayly and yearely, for the deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the soule of the riche man, and but one for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and indigent?</p>
            <p>We haue sene (Helas) that if a riche and potent man, should haue bene called vpon, the Belles doubted, all the Altares and Church ful of dule, masses sung in euerie cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, continued so long as money wes payed: scarssy one said for the poore, what meaneth this? it being in the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ure of the preist, to deliuer and redeame as lyketh him,<note place="margin">Thefals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of papistes is here discribed.</note> ether muste we say that the preist hath bene inuius and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naritius, or the masse is not of equale value to the riche, and to the indigent, but the more money is payed for them they are of les value: this muste of necessitie follow.</p>
            <p>Last of all, I wold glaidlly be instructed of this, how it hath proceaded, that the Apostles neuer knew, nor teached the Churches, of this virtew of the masse. It may appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>are to be a wonderfull mater, that the Church of God should haue bene defrauded of so great a treasure in those
<pb facs="tcp:11:40"/>
dayes, we reid nothing in the Scriptures of this ryte of Sacrificing, for the dead and the quick. Of breaking of bread in the Lordes Table, &amp; communion of the body and blood of our Sauiour, many notable testimonies we haue, but of this thy Sacrifice and applycation of the masse, at the appetite of any man, or otherwayes there is neuer a syllabe.</p>
            <p>I pas by sindrie maters, that might be adduced, and should serue properly to this purpose, as why, at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, when this opinion entered in of thy Sacrifice of the masse, a lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g time there wes but one in euerie Church yea, amonges a great multitude of Monkes and Freares, there wes but a preist, and an Alter, a masse, and that but vpon Solemne dayes, as we see yet in these dayes, but an Alter in the Popes Chappell,<note place="margin">The po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes chap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pell is yet a wit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niste the multy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of masses.</note> a masse, and that but at certane tymes in the yeare. By these thinges I truste it may be easylie espyed, of what mynde this Author ascei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth the applycation of the fructes of the Lordes death, to the masse, euen to foster and manteane all wickednes and impietie, to the plaine mockage, derision, and contempt of God, peruersion and supplantation of his holy ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, defacing and burying of the Sacrifice of the croice, &amp; fynally to thruste the Sonne of God, out of his owen roume, to spoile him of his prerogatiue of Eternal preist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head and intruding a preist. The Apostle pronounceth, that Christe the Sonne of God, by his onely oblatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ones offered, purchased Eternall sanctification, to all the Elect of God. And in that disputation, not onely abbrogateth and wypeth away the Sacrifices of the Law, but also ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refuteth your vaine dreame of this sacrifice of the masse. Ye affirme your masse to be a Sacrifice, by virtew where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ye haue remission of sinnes, and that als well to the dead,<note place="margin">None can offer Christe, but him<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selfe, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> is of the Father, thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to appo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inted.</note> as to the quick. The Apostle affirmeth plainely, that there is no place now to any Sacrifice, since the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Ieremie is accomplished and fulfilled: when ye are thus vrged, ye true to your shift, and cryeth that it is no new Sacrifice, nor any thing different from the Sacrifice of Christe, but the self same. The Apostle occurreth to this, and denyeth that it oght any wayes to be repeated or reiterat, and is not contented to call it a Sacrifice, but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioneth that it wes ones made, yea, and wholy vendicates the glorie and prerogatiue of the Eternal preisthead, vnto
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:11:40"/>
the onely anoynted of God, so that it can co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uene to none to offer him vp, but to him self. Your craft to schift you of this, is to say, that the wordes of the Apostle, are to be vnderstand of a bloody maner: your Sacrifice (say ye) is vnbloody, but the Apostle affirmeth without any exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that there can be no Sacrifice, by which remission of sinnes is obteined, without effusion of blood.<note place="margin">The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle sayeth ge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nerally, that ther is no sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for sinne, without blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Last of all ye here affirme, that it is a certane applyca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the feuer, of that a Sacrifice offered by our Sauiour. To this the Apostle answereth for this cause, and to this effect, the ceremonies and Sacrifices of the Lawe, haue bene abbrogated and taken away, by the death of Christe, because in them there wes memorie and mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of sinnes, which they were no wayes able to take away. Whereby ye are constrayned and compelled, in dispite of your obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat and indured hart, to grant that no such kynde of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plycation can haue place, as ye haue foolishely deuised. Change and turne thee in als many formes and figures, as the Poyet speaketh of Prothe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For the Supper we know most assuredly that the intention of our Sauiour wes not, that it should be practised and celebrated by night, but we knowe the cause why he taried and aboide the comming of the night, which wes, that he wes to eat the Pasouer with his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, the which Lambe of the Pasouer, wes vnder the Lawe of Moyses, euen as the holy Table is to vs now, for therein the Iowes had a certaine visible signe, how that God had preserued them miraculusly, when as his furie wes disployed vpon the Realme of Egypt.

communion at that tyme, so that this is not to make a certane reule, or to giue a certane instruction, so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually to do. Now then we haue to aduert, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerue diligently, and to followe this as an infallible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ule, that in the actions of our Sauiour, we muste luke, what it is that he willeth vs to take and follow, as a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane and sure reule, to giue, as it were, from hand to hand,<note place="margin">what we oght to followe, by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> but in other thinges that are not to be drawen exactly to imitation nor consequence, we haue nothi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g there to moue, as when our Sauiour sayeth, hauing receaued the bread, take ye, eat ye, this oght to be obserued strictly. The cause is, for it wes not for a tyme that our Sauiour gaue the bread, but he willeth that the bread, yea, euen this day, and to the end of the world (the bread I say) should be distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his Name, and euen as he were in the middest of vs. And suchlyke of the Cuppe.</p>
            <p>He willeth that we eat the bread, to be thereby admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed &amp; instructed, that our nourishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is of his body, and when we shall drink the wyne, that we receaue it as a figure, that his blood is our Spiritual drink, &amp; it whereby our soules and consciences are refreshed, to that heauenly immortalitie, that is to be reueiled vpon the Sonnes of God. To determine thus exactly vpon the tyme of the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration of the Lordes Supper, that we shall insist with all rigor, hauing no necessitie, as it were mere rashnes, so we grant that the Church may appoint some other tyme, since there is no commandemnt thereof.</p>
            <p>The cause why the communion is distrybuted in the morning, it is easy to be gathered of Cypriane.<note place="margin">Cypry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anes mynde, that the Lordes Supper shoulde be cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</note> First that the morning is more commodius to the celebration of the holy assemblies. For we obserue many thinges to fall in the rest of the day, whereby men are withdrowen from godlie actes and interpryses.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we are moste sober then, and haue our mindes moste able and ready to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceaue heigh &amp; weightie maters. He addeth thridly, that the morning tyme is a certane mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of the Resurrection of our Sauiour, which is not to be dispysed in this holy mysterie. Trew it is, that the Ancients in the tyme of abstine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and fasting, because they tuke no meat before night, they defered the communion to that tyme, spending and bestowing the whole day in fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, praying, preaching, Psalmes singing, and other godly

exercise. At night wes the celebration of the Supper, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they offered them selues to the holy Table: syne passed home to the refection of their bodies. But this consuetude wes abbrogated by the sext council of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stantinopole hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in Trullum. The Decries we haue in the Greik tonge, where plainely mention is made, that this consuetude wes obserued in the Churches of Affrica, yea, Augustine shaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that in his tyme in many places vpon the Thurisday before the Pashe tyde, after Supper, the Table wes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned vnto the faithfull,<note place="margin">Christe bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vs to no tyme for the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating of the lor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des table</note> that there might appeare no def<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference from the action of our Sauiour. But in this we haue not to be verie cairfull, so we may haue the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in their owen simplenes and integritie: Since of such circumstances, there is nothing commanded, and they touch not the substance of the mater. But in few wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des plainly to answer our captius Momus, in appoi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting a seuerall tyme, to the vse of the Lordes Table, other then at after Supper, in so doing I say, we do rightly abyding in that libertie which our maister and lawmaker hath gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>Now where it is here obiected, that Christe did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate onely to his tuelf Apostles, and that we receaue all men and wemen indifferently. It is not clearly declared by the Euangelistes, if there wes no mo then present with our Sauiour. It is moste probable that there wes mo, for it is not to be supposed,<note place="margin">Christe gaue a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mande<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment to diuide &amp; distribut thebread and also drinke</note> that the godly and religius ladies that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually did follow him, yea, and in the moste trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blus and dangerus tymes did not leif him, that they were not present then, when he gaue and left to his Church the moste quick and confortable testimonie of his coniunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with them.

But this is the continuall practise of Sathan, to damne in all others, that which they do them selues. And in this that we vrge thus earnestly the communion which can not be with out distribution, there is no such danger as thou pretendest, of subuersion of our whole Faith and Religion. For we affirme plainely, that our Religion can not stand, if we shall not beare that reuerence vnto the ordinances &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions of the same, that we decline not one iote from the reule that is layed before our eyes, by the Lord Iesus. And howsoeuer thou vnderstandest this that thou subiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, that if we shall do nothing but it that the Lorde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus did, we shall incurre the same danger of peruerting of all.

The one is to receaue vs, of nature being strangers, into the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, league, societie and housholde of God: the other is to witnes and testifie, that all those that be thus entered in the league, to them all is common, they are all mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of one body, they haue all one faith, one Baptisme, one Lorde, and Father of oure Lorde Iesus Christe, vpon the body and blood of the which Iesus, they do all fead,<note place="margin">The def<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betuix the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, &amp; the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>die and blood o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The eight day precisely wes appointed for ministration of the Sacrament of circumcision, so that now supputation to be made from the day of the Natiuitie of the Childe; ether thou moste say that God prouided them all to be borne in one day, or els they were receaued according to the ordour of the Lawe, euerie one conforme to the calculation from his Natiuitie, so that now, one wes receaued seuerally, or els God prouided mo. This can not be denyed to vs, but in the Pasouer thou will not finde that one did sit doune alone &amp; eat it, but that rather then any should lacke of the nomber, they should call vpon their nighboures, and so go to that mysterie.</p>
            <p>Now consider with thy self, first in the figures of the one &amp; the other. Secondly, in the effectes, the defference betuix the one and the other, that thy argumentes can no wayes procead nor haue any place.</p>

As Baptisme, we know that our Sauiour ordeined it most simplie in the word, and in the watter, preach, sayeth he, and baptise, let the worde, sayeth Augustine, come to the Element, &amp; then shall we haue a Sacrament.</p>

For this cause plainly pronounceth Paule that the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians did not eat the Lordes supper, the cause is exponed in the Text, and clearly declared by the Ancients, because they patched in somwhat of their owen, and so peruerted the puritie of the Sacrament: what if Paule should now reuiue and see how miserably and traterouslie ye haue abu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sed and deceaued the world: I think he should lay it sorer to your charge, nor he doeth to the Corinthians. I regard not what intention soeuer they procead of, these your cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies: for I am sure ye haue no such cloik nor couerture, as had the Corinthians, to wit, the releif and support of the poore:<note place="margin">So neid full a thing as the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting and rele<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uing of the pure culd not haue pla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce to be ioyned with the Lordes Supper</note> So that not onely their blissed communication in Iesus Christe wes preached vnto them, but liuely prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised, the poore and riche, all conuening together, eating at one table, and the poore supported by the riche, without any contempt or disdaine. Of the tyme and place, and suche others circumstances, that thou callest ceremonies, I haue already protested, that I moste willingly subscriue with you: but I deny that the same proceadeth of the multytude for I affirme that to be a substanciall ceremonie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded and appointed by our Sauiour, whose institution, the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and the eareth may not, nor oght, alterre.</p>
            <p>In the institution of his holy Supper, he tuke bread, brake it, gaue thankes, and distributed it, so that no perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, how well disposed soeuer he shall appeare, may take vpon him to change this: that is to say, to offer him to this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alone, no more then one seuerally might haue eaten the Pashe Lambe, seing it is the ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of our Sauiour, and the mysterie of our coniunction, consociation and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie with him, moste liuelye set furth in it: no more nor the bread is made of a graine of wheit, can there be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion without distribution: and in this no man can co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleane that he is frustrat, iniuried, or euill entreatted, but rather may haue iuste occasion of complaint, where as the institutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of God haynuslie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temned, he might be broght in a fals, erronius, and wicked opinion. So these priuate masses, and quiet Tables, that be appointed for one, are
<pb facs="tcp:11:47"/>
altogether against the institution of this Sacrament, and the nature of it, and can not be without an horrible Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, iniurie, and s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Besydes this, if ye had any reuerence of God in youre breastes, or respect to his holy ordinances, what is the cause that thretry or fourtie of you, being at your masses together, he in this corner, and here an other Sire Ihon i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For as the cheif and principal confort, we haue of the Lordes Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is, to assure vs, that we fead vpon the body and blood of Iesus Christe, and that we are ioyned and made all one in him: So no dout, they excommunicat them selues, and cutteth them of, as it were, from Christes body, that seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally craueth it, and of a wicked zeal, offereth them to it, since their deutie is rather neuer to o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But here may be demanded of you, if he institute a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice according to the ordour of Melchisedec, why did he not appoint Sacrificers? For there can be no Sacrifice, without a Sacrificer, nor oblation, without a preist, as we speak now. If thou will say that your shauelinges be Sacrificers, then will I demand of you, their vocation, I am assured by the Author to the Hebrewes, that the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of preisthead apperteaneth to the Sonne of God, as also witnesseth Dauid in the. 110.

Besydes this, if ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and gift should be thus confounded, as thou wolde persuade, then should it follow, that as thou goest about to proue, that there be two oblations of our Sauiour, so shal I adde the thride, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he wes giuen to the world that then wes he offered. I am not ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that the whole course of his peregrination here, may apperteane and be referred to his offering. But we do cal that properly and specially his oblation, when he entereth in the Battel, and conflict with the aduersarie powers, the tormentes, and

panes of death, and the anguishe and thrist of mans Sal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uation, euen till his departing.</p>
            <p>I will not deny, but the godly interpretors may in this place, take these two maner of speakinges to an effect, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring them bothe to the Sacrifice of the croice, as they oght to be, but seing thou doest it to abuse the Text, and wreist the sense of it, to confirme thy wicked opinion: It is neidfull to shaw thee, the absurditie that shall ensew. Doutles if thou should vnderstand the wordes, &amp; referre them to that oblation that wes a lytle after made vpon the croice, then should I grant thy sayinges, and go with thee moste willingly, being assured of the approbation of the wholle Church,<note place="margin">Of what ordorthe papisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal prei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes be, to wit, of Epicu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rus and Sarda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>napalus</note> and consent of the Godlie Fathers.

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:11:51"/>
that he moste craftilie and inuiusly taketh from vs, that great &amp; infinite treasure of the latter Supper of the Lorde Iesus, which we are commanded to practise,<note place="margin">Marcke well ye papistes what hor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rible sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge, ye co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit</note> til his retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: and in the which he hath so mercifully, and aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly disployed his benefites, giftes &amp; mercies towards man. This I say, this Author taketh from man, for if, giuen to you, includeth the communion (as this Author sayeth) and our Sauiour hath pronounced no such thing, but giuen for you, it followeth well that here there is no such institutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the holy communion, for by this Author giuen for you, is offered for you. Christe then offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him self there: we be commanded to do the same: then followeth that we are commanded to offer him, and so to make Sacrifice of him, where is there any place to the communion then? whiche is no Sacrifice: or els of necessitie thou shall grant that the communion and the Sacrifice, are bothe one, which repugneth manifestlie to thy doctrine, but aggreeth in deid with the Ancientes.</p>
            <p>For some of them we obserue, to haue giuen this Name of Sacrifice to the Lordes Table, but that improperlie:<note place="margin">Some of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientes named the Lor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is instituted and practised, in memorie of that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, which onely is worthy of that name, consider how thou art trapt in the same Snaire, that thou prepared for others, and how craftily to establishe thy impius Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the masse, thou fraudest the whole Congregation of that great and inestimable confort of the Lordes Table.</p>
            <p>This belyke thou wolde meane, howsoeuer thou sayest, that in these wordes (giuen for you) is included not onely the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion, but als the Sacrifice of the masse, for with what Brow can thou deny, but I may collect of this thy doctrine, that there is no communion at all, for as thou sayest, giuen to you, includeth the communion, so say I, that giuen for you, includeth only the masse: It followeth well: for giuen for you, is asmuch, as offered for you, and so importeth a Sacrifice, then it followeth well, that we haue no communion, but a Sacrifice onely, for thou will not grant the communion and the Sacrifice to be one, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiding and separating the one, from the other, and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting two diuers institutions in the latter Supper. And so alwayes it is fals that thou assumest to proue that our Sauiour institute two thinges here, the holy Table, and the Sacrifice of the masse. And lykewise it followeth
<pb facs="tcp:11:52"/>
euidently, that ether we shal lacke the communion, or els the masse. This followeth moste necessarly of thy interpre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tation: if thou will say, that the communion is conteined in the former parte of the Table, he tuke bread, brake it, gaue thankes, and gaue it to his Disciples: and in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part (for so ye of your factio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> distinguisheth the wordes) this is my body, which is giuen for you, here he institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the Sacrifice: the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement apperteaneth equalie to bothe, then muste it follow that there be two seuerall actions,<note place="margin">The pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes set<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting vp their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uillishe Masse, mak the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> the former hauing, as it were, nothing to do with the latter, the communion, to wit, and the masse.</p>
            <p>Secondly hereby we shall collect, that there shalbe a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament without a promes, euerie man I truste wil gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the Lordes Table to be a Sacrament, which can not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist without the promes. For if (giuen for you) appertea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to the wordes preceading, this is my body, and shall altogether be referred to thy masse, and now shal haue nothing to do with the former action of distribution of the bread, this Sacrament shall lack the promes: and so consequently shalbe no Sacrament: how vaine and fonde this is, let euerie man iudge. For I darre affirme, that there is no man of iudgement, that wil diuide and disseuet this action, being all one: and what Sacriledge doest thou think it to dissociat, distract, and put a shunder, that which is ioyned by God? And to answer you, sire, in your owen maner,<note place="margin">It is eui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that Christe did neuer ordeine the masse</note> what wes the cause, if the mynde of our Sauiour wes to institute here a Sacrifice, and that such a Sacrifice as your masse, that he doeth not take a peice or portion of bread, a certane quantitie of wyne, erect vp an Altare, or at the least, withdraw him self some space from the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, vse the ceremonies that ye do vse, and so to make and offer vp the Sacrifice?</p>
            <p>We know that the wisedome of our God, hath forget nothing vncommanded, touching the offering vp of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices in the Law, the garmentes and apperrell of the Preist, the erecting of the Alter, the beast that wes to be slaine, and lykewyse of the rest of the circumstances &amp; ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, then to be vsed, when as the preist approched to the practise of the oblation.</p>
            <p>Should this haue bene pretermitted in this Sacrifice, where the Sonne of God is offered vp, the veritie and treuth of all Sacrifices preceading? We obserue with what
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:11:52"/>
solicitude, studie, and cairfulnes, the Spirit of God pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth furth the celebration of the Pasouer, and with what diligence our Sauiour and maister Christe Iesus celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, according to the precept of the Law, not passing by a ceremonie. And requireth he not the same of vs in obser<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uation of his ordinances? Will ye affirme that there is any obliuion, forgetfulnes, sleuth, or negligence in our God? Why doeth he not then say to his company, in this maner? now haue I celebrated the Pasouer, appointed by my heauenly Father to be practised, in memorie &amp; remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of your potent &amp; mighty deliuerance out of Egypt, where your fathers wes holden in seruitude &amp; bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dage: this ceremonie is now to be taken away, in place of the which, shal ye haue an other sacrifice: wherein ye shal offer vp my body, yea, my verie reall and natural body &amp; blood, vnder the formes of bread and wyne, ye shall erect an Alter, the Preistes shalbe chosen with such qualities, anoynted, sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, they shal haue such apperrell. And in this maner shal they celebrate this Sacrifice.</p>
            <p>It were werisome here to rehears all your murgeons, which ye think and iudge so necessarie, that they can not be pretermitted, without an horrible Sacriledge. Thus, we find in the figure all thinges prescribed by the mouth of God, in the Sacrifices of the Law, and nothing passed by. But here, neuer a word of any such thing, a simple ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion recyted, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement giuen to practise the same, and the promes made, out of the which, this Scripturare wil fyne out a Sacrifice, which he after trauelleth to proue by the exemple of the Pasouer, which albeit it wes a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, yet sayeth he, it wes offered vp: to this I will not answer presently, but wil differre the ful answer to the proper roume. Yet will I say, that if they should pretend the similytude of the Pasouer, they should not thole them selues to be so driuen and caried away, from the institutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Supper. For in the practise of the Pasouer, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer they were commanded to celebrate it, they preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted not one iote of the ceremonies appointed, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented nor added none of their owen braine, nether yet pared any thing: but being conuened together with staues in their handes, their Loynes gyrded, they did eat it, with the rest of the ceremonies. The same shoulde haue bene done of you, that it might appeare, that ye beare some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence
<pb facs="tcp:11:53"/>
to the ordinances of God.</p>
            <p>If ye should set you at a Table, and there reuerently, take bread, giue thankes, break it, and so make distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, according to the exemple lest to you by Iesus Christ: albeit ye should bragge somwhat of a Sacrifice, some cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour might ye haue, and it were somewhat tollerable. But where this is whollie,<note place="margin">The sacrifice that the papistes haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyeth wholie the Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des insti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tution.</note> not onely inuerted, but peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, so that your deuillish ꝓceadinges, are als co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarius to the action of our Sauiour, as the night and the day: and yet will ye pretend a commandement so to do, and bragge of a Sacrifice, inuented by your selues, vtterly distroying the Lordes action, as we haue already prouen, and shall yet trauell to make more cleare and sensible: what resteth to vs, to say or do, but to declyne and eshew your compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and pronounce you possessed. For I am assured, the Deuill him self, neuer inuented thinges more contrarius to God, more repugnant to his glorie, nor ye haue done, and practisest daylie (Helas) vnder the cloik of Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

            <p>First I trust no man will deny, but here our Sauiour doeth institute a Sacrament,<note place="margin">In the action of the Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destable we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue of Christe: but we nether giue nor offer any thing to him.</note> and Sacramentes we know to be outward and externall signes, hauing the promises of God adioyned, in the which our God offereth &amp; giueth vnto vs his giftes, and not we giue or offer any thing to God: as hath bene heretofore shortly spoken and declared, by the exemple of Baptisme, and will now in this action, in the which our Sauiour, with the bread &amp; wyne, giueth vs his body, and his blood, adding and adioyning the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mise, whereby also he offereth and giueth vnto vs, his giftes and benefites, and not we to him.</p>
            <p>These benefites he communicateth vnto vs, to this end that they shal remane to our vse, profite, and commoditie, and not we (say I) to offer them vnto God, but onely of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to him the Sacrifice of thankes geuing, praising and extolling him for his great and infinite goodnes towardes vs. In which consideration, this Sacrament is called of the Grecians <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> that is improperly a Sacrifice, for this deffierence is betuix the natures of the Sacrament, and of the Sacrifice, that in this we offer to God, in the other we receaue from God.</p>
            <p>This I am assured, the wordes of the action it self wil testifie, he tuke bread, and hauing giuen thankes,<note place="margin">The promes muste be referred to the ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion, and to none other thing.</note> brake &amp; gaue it vnto his Disciples, saying, take ye, eat ye, this is my body, and sofurth.

            <p>Now the sense of the wordes is plaine, that our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our offereth and giueth to the faithfull and worthy recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, his body to fede vpon,<note place="margin">The pla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ine sense and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aning of Christes words i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the laste Supper</note> and his blood to be refreshed thereby, vnto euerlasting lyfe.

               </gap> that is when the name of the thing signified, is giuen to the signe it self: so S. Paule doeth expone this, giuen for you, to be asmuche, as, broken for you. No man will, or darre say, that the na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>turall body of our Sauiour wes broken, for it wes writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ye shall not break one bone of him.<note place="margin">Exo. 12.</note> Herein there is an vndouted allusion, to the fraction of the bread, appointed and vsed in the communion, and lykewise a plaine decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, how the wordes of the promes oght to be taken Sacramentally, and figuratiuely. This shortly for the declaration of the wordes.</p>
            <p>Now followeth the latter wordes of the institution: do this in remembrance of me, which nowayes can be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand of any Sacrifice,<note place="margin">The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of these wordes, do this in reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For these wordes our Sauiour doeth referre to the actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> preceading, take ye, eat ye, this is my body, drinke of this ye all: and thus eating and drinking, celebrate the remembrence of me, to wit, that I haue giuen and offerred vp my body for you, &amp; that I haue shed my blood for you, to the remission of your sinnes, for if these wordes (giuen for you) and (shed for you to remission of sinnes) should not wholy be referred and appertane to the Sacrifice of the croce, then should it follow that the Sacrifice of the croce, wes not necessarie, seing by your interpretation, we haue remissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of sinnes by the virtew of this action, &amp; so shal the virtew of the Sacrifice of the croce euanesh. Paule exponeth these wordes (as I haue) not of a Sacrifice,<note place="margin">

For it is plaine and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest by Paule, that in this publique action, in the which, he commandeth one to tarie vpon an other, and in the which, the body of our Sauiour is eaten, and his precius blood, drunkt: That he willeth, that we conioyne the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration of the benefites procured vnto vs, by his death
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:11:54"/>
with the action it self. And that we giue thankes, for these giftes, and so in nowise willeth he vs to offer his body &amp; blood, but that we eat and drinke them, and so to celebrate and annunce his death: that is, the great and inestimable deliuerance, purchased by his death.</p>
            <p>If any please to speak as the Ancients do, and call it a Sacrifice, I repugne not: so he vnderstand not, that Christ is here to be offered for the offences of the people, for the sinnes of the leuing, and the dead, for Saluation, and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furth. For he hath by this one oblation, ones made, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mat and perfected his faithfull and Elect for euer.</p>
            <p>For it is a haynus blasphemie, to think that any man may offer vp the Sonne of God vnto the Father, as we haue already heretofore declared, he being him self <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> that is, the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer, and the oblation it self, as I am able to proue by the Greik Cannon, and the Ancients all in one voice.<note place="margin">Christ is by the worde of God, &amp; the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so called the offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer and oblation it self.</note> Now we offer not his body and his blood, the which we be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded onely to receaue, and were offerred of Christ him self, the virtew of the which oblation, yet remaneth, and shal perpetually, yea, and here they be offerred, and giuen vnto vs: but we againe offer vp prayers, laude, praise and action of thankes: which we are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded to ioyne with this action, In these wordes, do this in remembrance of me, which wordes are exponed by Paule, as we haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.</p>
            <p>Now this to be the verie Germane sense of the wordes of this action, I dout not: yea, and all godly consciences wil affirme and subscriue, that if an Angel of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should setfurthe any thing against this it is one accurse: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I haue not trauelled to satisfie the contentius, and obstinat persones, but because the wordes of the text were wrei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now let vs returne to our Author, who as he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne blasphemusly, so he contineueth impudently, and as I haue already forewarned you, so now shall ye finde his principal studie direct to this, that the whole commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion may be subuerted and distroyed, and his deuillishe masse erected. For here he plainely protesteth, that this

            <p>In deid maister Abbote, I wold glaidly ye should leaue your magistrall and Sorbonik maner of speaking, and proue your sayi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs, but God be praised, it appeareth that ye be rather a Scoller of Pythagoras, yea, Pythagoras him self, nor a Scoller of Christ Iesus.

            <p>Strange it is, to see a man so caried away with his owen fantasy, so giuen ouer in the handes of Sathan, that he shal repyne against God, that he shall renunce and refuse the manifest veritie of God, confessed in all aiges, to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishe his owen imagination.</p>

So if ye wolde prosper, or think to haue victorie in this cause, ye muste sharpe your pen plainely against it, as it appeareth well your mynde is. These thinges in deid, for conclusion, since ye adduce nothing to proue them, they are als easylie reiected of vs, as ye obtruse them.</p>
            <p>Here our new Sorbonist, being required by Iames, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth his argument &amp; that Syllogistice, in what figure or mude, I truste he learned not so farre, for he is but one of our Mule maisters, howsoeuer he boldly taketh to him this style. <q>The Lorde (sayeth he) gaue comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement in the latter Supper to his Apostles, to do as he did: the Lorde maid oblation of his body and blood, in his latter Supper, as is sufficiently prouen be the hail Text,<note place="margin">Any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that is not vtter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly blind, may here easylie se how foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishe and fals be the argu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes.</note> quhairfore it followis weill, that the Lorde gaue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to his Apostles to do the same, saying: do this in remembrance of me, ergo cleik.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now moste reuerend Doctor, for the parte of Iames, I answer, the Lorde gaue commandement in his latter Supper, to do as he did. Trew it is: The Lorde made ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of his body and blood, in his latter Supper, that I deny, and wil affirme further, that it is fals, blasphemus, intollerable, wicked, impius, and deuillishe, and a thing that thou, yea, and all the papistes in the earth ioyned with thee, are not able to proue.

            <p>To the minor I haue already answered at lenth, so now thy assumption being denyed, and moste properly refelled, Inferre what thou list, thou shall conclude nothing but mere vanitie, falshead and blasphemie.

But according to the mater, now will I reason with you thus, as the action of the Supper will beare. Iesus Christ commanded his Disciples to do that he had done, Christe tuke bread, gaue thankes, brake and distributed it, saying: this is my body, which is giuen for you: ergo, we should do the same, that is to say, take bread, break bread, giue thankes and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate. &amp;c.

But least afterward we haue not so gauing occasion, as now is offerred, to speak of the tearme, it shall not be altogether out of the way, to defyne and declaire what the euergie of the word is, and what it is to offer, and Sacrifice to God. Offer, we vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to be, to subiect him self, to the will of the Father, to deriuate the wraith, the ire, the indignation, yea, and the paine due to all our sinnes vpon him, and so to represent, stay &amp; arreast him self, as the verie Sacrifice and oblation, to susteane and those the Ire of God for sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, to transferre the whole offences of the people vpon his shulders, to be as it were culpable, damned, and to be made an accurse, yea, and the verie sinne it self, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Hebrew phrase, tearming the Sacrifice by the name of the sinne that it is offerred for. According lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to the sayinges of the Prophet Esaye, and after him S. Paule. In this maner is to be vnderstand,<note place="margin">2.

            <p>The Lambe and oblation, and he that hath offerred vp this Sacrifice, we acknowledge to be Iesus Christe, who being the onely preist, that by the offering vp of him self, hath entered in the moste holy place, yea, and who hath Sacrified him self for vs, because that none other wes euer able to haue borne the indignation of the Father but he.

What a mad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes and phrenesie, shall we think it in this Scripturer, that he can not content him self with this that the Spirite of God hath teached vs? The author to the Hebrewes hath declared the wordes of the Psalme, and hath pretermitted nothing, apperteaning to the similytude and comparison of our Sacrificator Iesus Christe, and Melchisedec.</p>
            <p>The Psalmist,<note place="margin">The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aning of the Psal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mest.</note> no dout, in the forenamed Psalme, ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicateth and attributeth to our Sauiour, the dignitie of the kingdome, together with the progatiue of Eternal preist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head: hauing spoken of his kingdome, in the fourt verse, he discendeth to his preisthead, where he sheweth his preist<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>head, to be farre different from the preisthead of Aaron, being such an as should not now be after the ordoure of Aaro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but after the ordor of Melchisedec. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly he shew<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth it to be firme and stable, planted by the authoritie of the Eternall, who shall neuer be strucken with repentance, that is, the thing he hath ones decreed, shal not alterre nor change: then doeth he adde the orackle, which doeth not consist in oblation of bread and wyne, nor yet is it added, thou art a preist, according to the ordour of Melchisedec, to signifie any such thing, as thou fondly diuisest, but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claire the perpetuitie and the qualitie of his preisthead, as the author to the Hebrewes doeth plainely witnes, declair and expone.</p>
            <p>First then we haue here the kingdome and the preisthead giuen by God vnto our Sauiour, so that he is bothe king and preist. By the kingdome we vnderstand,<note place="margin">What is to be vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derstand by the kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e and prei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sthead of Christe.</note> that power that is giuen to him in heauen and in earth, to gouerne &amp; defend his subiectes, to be auenged vpon his enimies.</p>
            <p>The office of the preist, is to instruct in the feare of God, to intercead for remission of sinnes, to pray &amp; offer, which
<pb facs="tcp:11:58"/>
offices, the Euangelist doeth pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nely witnes, that Iesus Christe hath fulfilled.<note place="margin">The papistes beshame<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>les liers alwayes</note> And therefore ye do manifestly belie the spirit of God. And where ye affirme that Iesus Christ did no parte of the office of Melchisedec, vnles we grant that he did offer vp him self, vnder the formes of bread and wyne, that is a manifest vntrenth. For that Christ is king &amp; preist, wes the office of melchisedec, that his preisthead is eternal, and not temporal (as the preisthead of Aaro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wes) is proper to Melchiesdec, that Christ doeth blesse his elect, &amp; not curse them, wes also the office of Melchisedec, and all these I suppose ye wil confesse Iesus Christ, hath done, &amp; yet doeth. These two offices in Moyses and Aaron, being distinguished, are ioyned in Melchisedec, the Type and figure of our Sauiour, in whome they be not onely ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but perfected.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as the kingdome and preisthead are not giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to him by man, but by God: as we may collect of this that the Lorde sweare. This obserueth the author to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes, when he sayeth: no man vsurpeth any honoure, but he that is called as Aaron.<note place="margin">An anti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thesis, betiuxt Christ &amp; the pope</note> So the Sonne of God, being Lorde of all, abydeth the appointment and vocation of his Father: to the great shame and rebuke of the Popes, that no les impiuslie nor impudently, taketh and vsurpeth the crowne of the kingdome, and the myter of the Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prie, and preisthead to them selues, without commission, or laufull vocation. And therefore moste iustlie shall it be said to them, they reigne, but not of the Lorde, they are preistes, but not the Lordes.</p>
            <p>Thridly, this preisthead is assigned with a great cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, and by a certane Religion established, &amp; that with one Solemne othe, which peculiarly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueneth to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, and is diligently noted, in the Epistle to the Hebr. others preistes (sayeth he) are made without any othe,<note place="margin">Hebr. 7.</note> but this preist is made by the othe of him that said to him, the Lord hath sworne, &amp; shal not repent him, thou art the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal preist: that by two things that can not be moued, the promes,<note place="margin">An sure comforte by the preisthed of Christ</note> and the othe, by the which it is impossible, that God shal lie, we may reteane the most firme confort of our faith, conceaued of the preisthead of Christe, that with a steadfast esperance we may enter in the inward partes of the Sanctuarie with our Sauiour.</p>
            <p>Feardly, this preisthead, thus confirmed with an
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:11:58"/>
othe, can not be changed nor transferred, but shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine firme and immutable. For it is plainely said, and he shoulde not repent him. This steadfaste per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuitie of the preisthead of our Sauioure,<note place="margin">The per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>petuitie of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes prei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sthead.</note> is obserued and declared by the Apostle: many preistes, sayeth he, wes made vnder the Lawe, because they might not remane, being subiect to death: but our preist no wayes being sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to mortalytie, hath an eternall preisthead. The worde vsed by the Apostle, I haue noted before, and the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of it.</p>
            <p>And in this we may obserue the difference of the preist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of our Sauiour, from all other outward and externe, which can not be gouerned by the dead, and in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration requireth multitude and succession, since no man can haue an Eternall preisthead, being subiect to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie and corruption. So that the necessitie moueth, that may were made preistes. The preisthead of Christe is such that it can not be stayed by infirmitie,<note place="margin">The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of the preisthed of Iesus Christe.</note> retarded by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eas, nor impeded by death. But in the death rather appea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>reth cheiflie, he hauing thereby satisfied to the iudgement of his Father, and reconciled vs againe, so that yet stil he is able to susteane the duetie, and performe the office of preisthead, euen now sitting in heauen, at the right hand of the Father, and interceading for mercy to vs: whereby we are admonished, that the preisthead of Iesus Christe, is of a spiritual nature, not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sisting in any outward, forrane, and beggerly ceremonies, which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in nowise appease the wraith of God. This our Preist neuer fainteth in the execution of his office, euer leauing to call vpon God for vs. Now considder what ignominie it is to this Preist and his office, that a certane shauelinges shal intruse them selues in his office, and proudly take vpon them, the office of mediation betuix God and man, as that our Sauiour ether were negligent, or then vnable to discharge him of his office.</p>
            <p>Now in this that is said (after the ordour of Melchisedec) we shal obserue that there wes neuer from the beginning, any sorte of preisthead of that nature, that it might be any wise alterred, changed, or innouate at the appetite of any man, but euer restricted to a certane ordour, and that by God. So that now as it is easy to vaine, ambitius, &amp; me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of arrogant stomaches, to diuise &amp; innent preistheades
<pb facs="tcp:11:59"/>
and ordoures, at their owen pleasure, it is euen als easie to reiect them.</p>
            <p>Last shall we obserue, the diuersitie and dissagrement of this preisthead with it of Aaron, which consisteth in vm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, shaddowes, figures, rytes, and ceremonies, altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in them selues vnprofitable and vnable to obteane remission of sinnes,<note place="margin">Christe neadeth no succes<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>or, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he liueth for euer, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stle wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to the Heb.</note> and to pacifie Gods wraith: yea, and the which now, in respect of the infirmitie of it, by the which it wes astricted to a certane pluralitie, multitude, &amp; succession, is vtterly abolished. And now a Sacrificer is placed, all societie, fellowship, and company being remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. For the cause taken away, the effect muste cease. The cause of pluralitie, wes death, from the which our preist is exempted. Conferre this that we haue here adduced, with the sayinges of the Apostle, Hebre. 7. And all shalbe made manifest, that this Author goeth about to trouble. Where first the Apostle exponeth the name, which is Melchisedec, meaning the King of Iustice. Secondly, the place of his kingdome, which is Salem, that is quietnes and peace. For in his kingdome onely, is tranquilitie, as is written, there is no peace to the wicked, and by the Apostle, our Sauiour is called our peace. Thridly, is set furth his ge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which can not be declared, he being without Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, mother, and Genealogie. Feardly, the perpetuitie of his kingdome and preisthead,<note place="margin">The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, king<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome, preisthed and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogie of Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisedec.</note> nether hauing beginning nor yet ending, remaning the preist for euer, and made lyke vnto the Sonne of God. Fyftly, the dignitie and prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue of his preisthead, in that, that he receaueth teindes of Abraham the Patriarck and the appointed Father of all faithfull. Last, the office of his preisthead, in blessing Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, hauing already vsed him self liberally, as became a King, in receauing him and his company to banked.</p>
            <p>These thinges, how properly they conuene to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, it is more easy to considder, nor that I neid to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them particularlie. Now pas thy way, fond and vane Papist, and adde that which is impius, wicked, and deuil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishe. I regarde not how many thou haue to be compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in thy error. The Scollers of Christe beareth that reuerence to their maister, that where as the Spirite of God kepeth silence, they inquire not, as we may obserue by the exemple of the Author to the Hebrewes, who suteth nothing of Father, mother, nor Genealogie of Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisedec:
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:11:59"/>
but seing there wes none expressed by Moyses, he bothe willingly misknoweth it, yea, and willeth that we shall not inquire of it, hauing before our eyes, that moderation and sobrietie we oght to haue in reading and exponi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g of Scriptures, neuer to inquire further in the holy mysteries, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Gods holy spirit doeth teache vs.<note place="margin">In the mysteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of god we oght not to in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quire fur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther nor the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of God hes reueiled.</note> Wherfore we neid not to declaire any cause why, nor to what e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Mel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chisedec broght furth bread &amp; wyne, since the spirit of God declareth it not: alwayes that, that we haue spoken of the refreshing of Abraham, we haue followed the iudgement and coniecture of Iosephus, and Crysostomus, lyke as in Hosting, we know how thankfull it is, how great plentie of wictualles, soeuer we haue, to be refreshed with freshe meates and drinkes.</p>
            <p>Now good Reader, how captiuslie this wranglare of Scripture trauelleth in this mater, considder with thy self. I know wel ynough, what he braggeth of some of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, that abuseth this place of Melchisedec. But let no suffrage of antiquitie draw vs from the commentarie of the Spirite of God, who in a mater of so great weight, wold not haue pretermitted the oblation of Melchisedec, if it could haue serued anywise to the purpose.</p>
            <p>Hereby, Sire, ye may vnderstand sufficiently, that to be a preist, after the ordour of Melchisedec, is not to offer vp bread and wyne, as ye falsly alledge Melchisedec to haue done, but this to be referred to the stabilitie of Christes preisthead, and eternitie of the same, as I haue declared at large, so that we may collect the dout of Iames, to be moste reasonable, douting. </p>

For howsoeuer, euerie leaf of the tree hath the shaddow, coresponde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnto it, yet I am assured there be many ti<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>hgs in the figures of the olde Testament,<note place="margin">Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider here, Sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>We read plainely in the Text, that Melchisedec broght furth bread and wyne, and that to conforte Abraham and his Armie, as before we haue said.

And yet I will go further with you, that in the Lordes Table, we offer vp bread and wyne, to be sanctified of the Lorde, and that it may be made a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by him. These thinges as I will not deny, so they may somwhat conuene. But that he made oblation of bread and wyne vnto his Father, in any such condition as ye pretende, as Melchisedec made none at all, so his doing can not serue you, to proue your intent, yea, and

Ether must ye say that, in that, the Pasouer Lambe wes Sacrificed, it wes a figure of the immolation of our Sauiour vpon the croice, or then it wes a figure of that oblation that wes made (as ye pretend) in the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, take your chose, ye shall neuer conclude of it, two im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molations, as ye fondly trauel to proue.</p>
            <p>To it of the Supper, I can nowise aggre, for then the veritie shall not coresponde to the figure. In the Supper there wes no shedding of blood, as wes in the immolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Lambe,<note place="margin">The pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shal la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>be and the Lordes Supper do not aggre in all poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, for in the Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, wes no blood shedding</note> which is the principall point belonging to the nature of a Sacrifice, but ye will answer, that the La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>be wes offered in recordation of their deliuerance. I answer, that is verie fals, for it wes principally to serue to the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of that deliuerance and Sacrifice, whereby all Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices hath their vigure, and by the which we haue, all deliuerance, to wit, the Sacrifice of the croice. Ye will obiect <q>That the Sacrifice of the croice was not a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordation of the deliuerance of vs, fra the tyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of Sathan, bot the deliuerance it self.</q>
            </p>
            <p>That, I answer, is lykewise fals, speaking as ye do, strictly, For it is onely the instrument, by the which, of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:11:61"/>
the part of our Sauiour, deliuerance and Saluation, are purchased vnto vs, that beleueth in Iesus Christe.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Bot it was the Pascal Lambe (wil ye say) that was offered vp in recordatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of thair deliuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In that I say it doeth aggre with the Supper of the Lorde, that lyke as in it we are commanded to celebrate the Lordes death, till he come, so were they to haue reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of their deliuerance, so that this is not in respect of the offerring, which principally is to be referred to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the croice, whereof all Sacrifices were figures: but in consideration of the Lordes Table,<note place="margin">The lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des table came in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stead of the Pash<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cal lamb</note> which wes to be placed, and succead in the roume of it, and this to be the verie Bermane interpretation of that place, it is moste plaine, by the Apostle Paule. 1. Cor. 5. where he affirmeth Christe to be offered vp our Pasouer, and so exhorteth vs to be mirrie and reioyse, without any mention of Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and offerring vp of him, vnder the formes of bread and wyne.</p>
            <p>Trew it is, that in euerie ceremonie vnder the Lawe, we haue to consider thre sindrie thinges, the first is, a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of some benefite receaued: as no dout, the Pasouer, in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sideration that it wes a Sacrament, broght them in mynde of their deliuerance out of Egypt. Second<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, we haue to receaue it as an vmber or figure of Christe Iesus, as the offerring vp of the Lambe,<note place="margin">what we haue to consider in the sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>crifices of the Lawe.</note> the spilling of the blood of him, wes a figure of the Redemption of man, by the blood and passion of our Sauiour. Thridly, it ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for a document of good lyfe, holynes, and so furth.</p>
            <p>As the Apostle concludeth in the place before recyted, let vs reioyse in all puritie, and veritie. The same shall we obserue in the first fructes, and the rest of the Sacrifices vnder the Law: but to eshew all cauillatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of such Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, as go about to deceaue, we haue to obserue euerie point, to examine it that is proper to a Sacrament, and it that belongeth to a Sacrifice, and so to distinguishe them skilfully, as in the exemple of the Pashe Lambe, which in consideration of the offerring and immolation, onely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perteaneth to the Sacrifice of the croice, as I haue said.</p>
            <p>Now will I trauell to shew the aggrement and simily<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the Pasouer, with the Supper of the Lorde, yea, and wherein they do dissagre, as in no figure can be found
<pb facs="tcp:11:62"/>
the perfect image of the veritie, aggreing in all pointes with it that is corespondent, howsoeuer ye those your self to be deceaued, and goeth about to deceaue others. This is first to be obserued, in the institution of the holy Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that euen as immediatly, after the eating of the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, the holy communion wes instituted by our maister and Sauiour Christ: so doeth he obserue the same ordour that Moyses rehearseth to be kept, and wes appointed by the eternal our God, in the eating of the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Pasouer: for that same night that the Lorde had decreed to slay the first borne of Egypt, and to deliuer his owen peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by the hand of the Angell, he ordeined the Sacrament of the Pasouer, to be a testimonie and monument of that wonderfull deliuerance, euen immediatly after to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. The deliuerance of the people ensewed a lytle spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce after: the memorie whereof euerie yeare, by this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wes renewed at the commandement of God.</p>
            <p>In the same maner our Sauiour, that self same night that he wes to be betrayed, and in the which, he wes to beat doune that most cruel Pharoo, and his whole power, together with his first borne Sonne, Death, Hel, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the thinges that were prefigurate by the Pash Lambe, he institute the holy Supper, to be a perpetuall monume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of that vnspeakable benefite, he wes to obteane vnto vs, and in place of a Lambe, and the blood of it, the Symbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les of the Pasouer, he appointed the signes of bread and wyne,<note place="margin">Why our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>

Celius Rhodiginus teacheth this to haue bene moste so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne and familiare to the Lacedemonians, by the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of bread, to receaue in amitie, such as they embraced in confideracie and league. Aristotle in the. 8. boke of his Morals, declareth the nature of amitie, to be such, that as by mutuall leuing together, resorting at table together, it is reteaned, so by long silence and absence it is dissolued, as the greik Prouerb there recyted by Aristotle, and Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus in his fyft boke, doeth euidently proue. In these sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, our maister and Sauiour instituteth his holy Supper which wes to remane, and practised to his returning, to assure vs hereby of his prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, howsoeuer he is, touching
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:11:62"/>
his bodylie presence, absent, and to ratifie and establishe that amitie, league, and societie, the Eternall God recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vs in, and that in the blood of his deare Sonne. Touching the tyme, this we may obserue, that as the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of our God determineth all thinges, and appointeth in the moste due and conuenient tyme: So this hour of his Supper, to haue serued moste properly to that holy action, by him then practised. We obserue most diligently and kepe in mynde moste faithfully, not onely the factes, but the wordes of them that we see in the trauell and bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall of death, thereby as it were, calling to mynde the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie of him who is departed: these thinges as moste notable, we iudge moste worthy of Register, the treuth of them and maiestie being sealed vp by the verie death.</p>
            <p>The hour of his death then approching, and at hand, and in the which, not onely the Lambe of the Pasouer, but all the rest of the Sacrifices appointed in blood, were to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue their perfection and end, and so to haue no further place, the tyme can not be, but moste proper, the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Lawe being in no point by him neglected the figures fully performed, and the presence of his body to be immediatly after to them denyed. Wherefore, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cause he changed the signes, whereby the thinges to come, were foresignified, in such signes as should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claire those thinges to be performed already. So then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, the deliuerance by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eath of Christ, the memorie whereof, is celebrated by the frequentation of the Lordes Supper, to the which vse it wes appointed. For he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, take ye, eat ye, this is my body, do this in reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me, the which commandement (as I haue tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched) can of no better reason be separate from this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp; adioyned to any fond Sacrifice, nor the promes, by the which, is plainely declared the cause of the institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when he sayeth, this is my body, which is giuen to you: and this is my blood, and sofurth. For how I praye you can these wordes, that be here interiected (giuen for you, and shed for you) how can they (I say) be separate from the action preceading and from the commandement, that is after giuen? Or how can the commandement be drawen from the whole action preceading? That can be no more, nor the members from the body. So they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert the holy ordinance of our Sauiour, that separateth
<pb facs="tcp:11:63"/>
the commandement from the promes, or yet the promes, or any parte of it from the action.</p>
            <p>Now that the Pasouer wes lykewise a similytude and a figure of Christes death, may easylie be declared by sindrie thinges, which nowise can apperteane to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.

            <p>This oblation then, that Ireneus speaketh of, is not the oblation of the body and blood of our Sauiour, which fals lie to establish thy masse thou pretendest to be offred vp by a shaueling, for here there is no thing of any masse (God be praysed) spoken, but it is the whole outward, &amp; inward externe and spiritual worshipping.

            <p>Syndrie other places may I adduce of the same two Cheptres, wherein he decleareth plainely, that he meaneth of almous geuen to the nedy in the Lordes Supper, and of the table it self, prayer, and thankes geuing, and others suche laudable and Godlie customes as were then vsed, whiche alltogether are called the oblatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the new testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by this author.</p>

any thing myght be found in Cypriane, ye should, no dout, haue broght it furth, for it should haue serued more to your purpose. Shall ye thus be suffred to raill against God, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d inure suche insufferable blasphemies to the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and his sanctes, making him author of the moste de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable impietie, that euer wes diuised?

Be you assured, that the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall wyll not suffer the prophanation of his mysterijs, the decept of his people, and the wrangling of the wryttinges of his sanctes, vnpunished.</p>
            <p>Let vs returne to the wordes of Cypriane in the which it is moste certane that he speaketh no thing of priuat mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses vnknowen in his dayes, nether yet euer had place til that all being distroyed a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d waisted by the Gotthes &amp; Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delles and others,<note place="margin">When it wes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued that one should co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>municat for all.</note> fearslie could any multitude be conuey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Celebration of the Lordes Table, but belyke all goode sciences falling in decaye, the ignorance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Gods worde entred in, and receaued, that one should eat, for all the multitude, one should take vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him to do that which ought to haue bene done of all. Now the ancients did abhorre these priuate massts, we may knowe by the Epistle of Leo Pope, who wes many yeares efter Cypriane, to Diofcurus, where he declareth planelie that there wes but a masse, and that the whole people being co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ueyned together at festuall dayes and tymes, yea, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d euen in these our dayes, the Greik Churche hath no priuate masses, &amp; in the Popes owen Chapell, there is but one al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tare and a masse, and that seldome at certane appoynted tymes in the year.</p>
            <p>The wordes of Cypriane are to be vnderstande of the distribution of the Sacrament, and Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. For lyke as Christe vpon the Croce, offred him self to God the Father, and that the memorie of this his oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on myght be kept euer fresche and recent in his Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, he instituted the Supper, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teis thereof, breaketh bread, calleth it his body, and distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buteth to his Disciples, and sanctifieth the cuppe, calling it the blood of the new Testament: So the minister making distribution of the body and blood of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, according to his exemple and institution, and giuing thankes to the Eternall, for the Sacrifice and oblation

            <p>Now lest that the wordes that I haue added of Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ane, may appeare to be hurtsum and preiudicial to satisfie all readers and take all enasion frome yow. Let no man thinke that Cypriane wylleth a preist to stande vp by one altare allone and there to make one oblation by him self. But that he shall diuide and distribute to the assistars the body and bloode of our Sauiour, &amp; offre vnto God pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and action of thankes for the Sacrifice of the Croce, the memorie where of, is there solemnedlie celebrated, for that is to offre as Christe offred in the Supper, to wit, to giue thankes, pray to God, and so make distribution of the simboles of his body and bloode.</p>
            <p>It is well noted by Chrysostomus, there be some thinges wherein the Minister differeth frome the Commoun and layick people,<note place="margin">Wherein the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment of the minister consisteh at the lor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> which standeth not in that, that the Preist should make oblation and Sacrifice of Christe for them, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d eat the Lordes Supper for him self allone, and so to distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, and apply it to whom, and in what measure pleaseth him. But the preferment of the preist in this mater, is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the ministration, as Cypriane here plainely teacheth that the preist as a commoun minister and debter to the Churche, doeth preache the worde &amp; distribute the Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des supper vnto the people, who doeth receaue it at his handes.</p>
            <p>Here it shall not be altogether out of the way to schawe the causes that moued the ancients,<note place="margin">Why the holie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  </gap>es.</note> to call this action a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice or one oblation, which appearinglie be syndrie and diuers. The first cause is drewen frome the obseruation of the cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>etude in there dayes cheiflie of Ireneus &amp; Cypri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ane: the custome wes this, that the people broght with them a great quantitie of breade and wyne, and offred at the table, whereof a certane portion wes taken and vsed to the holy Communion, the residue, wes sanctified to the vse and supporte of the poore. And this no dout is the oblation, that Ireneus Cypriane a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Tertuliane, maketh so often me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion of, yea, the verrie collectes of your masse (as ye be verrie Aippes, &amp; wyll seme to had &amp; reteyne some figure and Image of antiquitie.) In this consideration wer called collettes, being receaued frome the people, and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:11:77" rendition="simple:additions"/>
oblations, because they wer offred to a holy vse in whiche respect Paule to the Philipp. calleth the almonsan Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and a hoste of sweit sauour, as I haue alreddy touched.</p>
            <p>Secundlye, there is one action of thankes an publyck attestation of our gratitude, and thankfulnes, which in the scripturs is called one Immolation of prayse, and laude. Thridlye, all communicantes doeth offre them to be reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and guyded by God, yea, and mortified, whereof spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth Paule to the Romans,<note place="margin">Rom. 12.</note> giue your bodyes (sayeth he) to God, a lyuing and a holy Sacrifice pleasing to God, and after he wytnesseth, that he beareth the ministerie,<note place="margin">Rom. 15.</note> and Sacrificeth the Euangell that the oblatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the Gentiles may be acceptable and sanctified by the holy spirit, as we haue cyted here tofore.</p>
            <p>The fourt is, that there is celebrated the memorie of the Lordes death &amp; passion, which because it wes the verrie &amp; full sacrifice, the name of sacrifice is applyed to that action whereby it is represented, and thus speaketh Augustine, when he sayeth by memorie and recordation our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our is euery day offred vp.</p>
            <p>These are the foure considerations, whereby the fathers are moued to giue the name of Sacrifice and oblation to the Lordes table, albeit that I dar not altogether allow this in them, for since the Scripture giueth no such name vnto it, and rashelie, we ought not introduce any new speaking nor yet leif the acquent maner and phrase of the spirit of God: yet somewhat is it tollerable in the fathers who caryed away in admiration of the dignitie and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynes of the misterie could not wit certanelie what prayse to giue to it &amp; with what tytle decore, set vp, and exorne it.</p>
            <p>Let this ones declared serue to the vnderstanding of the wryttings of the fathers, when soeuer ether we shall read any thing in them, or there authoritie shalbe layed against vs.</p>

            <p>For that the preparation of this Sacrifice is more mag<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nifique and wounderfull, nor the sacrifices vnder the law this is but spoken to extolle this holy Table aboue all the oblations of the law: In what respect and consideration it is declared at large. Of the offring vp of him self that is Sacramentalie spoken, and apperteyneth no thing to his reale presence.</p>
            <p>In the latter part, euen in the conclusion of the. 2. Sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e vpon the secunde Epistle to Timothie, he wrytteth these wordes, I wyll schewe yow something that is wounder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, meruell not, be not troubled, what is this? the holy oblation whidder it be offred by Peter or Paule, or any preist of what sumeuer merite, is the self same with it that Christe gaue to his Disciples, and that the ministers now doeth make, why so? because men do not sanctifie this, but Christe that hallowed that before, that as the wordes are one, that Christe then pronunced and they that be now pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nunced by the ministers, so is the oblation one: a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d thesame reason is of Baptisme: so all doeth consiste &amp; stand in faith.</p>
            <p>These be the wordes of Chrysostomus in the place before rehearsed.

In the secunde place adduced by yow, where the author is drewen to burste furth in admiration of this mysterie, and cal it a miracle, in deid it is excessiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie spoken to the prayse of the action.

Let vs rype the mater heigher Consider how easylie Adame created in all perfection and innocency is drawen from God, consider the staite of the world from Adame to Noie, where is the nomber of the godly, when we read, the Sonnes of God caried away by the doughters of men, and the whole nomber of the godly redacted to a certane family, and concluded in eight per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sones, yea and of the which persones, some were wicked. What do ye iudge here, of the permission of God? stryking as it were, the whole earth with blindnes, and ignorance of his worde, yea, and haynus Idolatrie, which ye shall finde to haue dured. 1556. yeares, what finde ye after the restitution, finde ye not the posteritie of Noie, to returne to the impietie of their Fathers, and continew therein ill the calling of Abraham? who out of the fyre of Idolatrie wes called, to the knowledge of God: and so the whole to haue continewed in impietie, from the tyme of the Flood, till Abrahames calling, the space of. 363. yeares.</p>
            <p>Now will I pas by Abraham, Isaac, Iacob, and the tyme of the Patriarches, and of their being in Egypt, and liue you to consider, how Moyses and Aaron are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the people in the Vildernes, and after them, Io<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>suah, and will enter into the historie of the Iudges.

            <p>But here ye will obiect and reply.

But if ye will hereby think that these thre con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring, are sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to establish any doctrine, otherwayes doutsome and fond, that I will vtterly deny, and proue to be a manifest blasphemie and vntreuth, for the Church of God hath no way nor reule to iudge and discerne betuix godly doctrine and wicked, but the Scripture,<note place="margin">The on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne and way to trie treu doctrine is the scripture of God.</note> whatsoeuer we finde here commanded, that haue we to receaue with all reuerence and expedition, it that is not here, or is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to this, to iudge it wicked and impius.</p>
            <p>Shall we think that antiquitie shall preiudge the holy or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of God, ether yet vniuersalitie or consent? Shal we think that the'boke of the Law Deuteronomium should not be receaued, because it had bene suppressed and tynt alo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g time? To the ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of God, howsoeuer they haue bene co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temned by the space of one aige, two, thre, foure, fiue, yea, a thousand aiges, yet are they euer to be receaued with all humilytie, trimbling and feare. But let vs consider, what is to be giuen to euerie head of these thre notes, and first of antiquitie, whereof ye bragge most, for that ye haue continually in mouth, the masse is so olde hath continued this long, and so furth. Shal this be now casten away, that hath bene so long reteyned?</p>
            <p>Firste I haue answered, it to be fals, that ye affirme to be trew, for there wes no masse in the Apostles dayes and tyme, nor yet in the primitiue Church, so that it is cleare to any that is wel versed and sene in antiquitie, that there wes no such abuse, a fiue hundreth yeares or longer, yea, and albeit this your masse had bene as ye falsly pretend in the dayes of the Apostles, Shall we think that sufficient to proue, and declare it to be good, which is a manifest impietie? God forbid.</p>
            <p>How olde I pray you is the Deuill, Author of all ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie &amp; impiet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e? How long is it since the fall of Adame? In this ye may consider the nature of the world, that euen since the creation, hath abused and inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted wicked wayes, to draw the people from the obedience of God, yea, and euen then when it appeared that the restitution promest by the Prophetes, wes so accomplished in Iesus Christe, that all lies and errors were vtterly rooted out and remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, yet do we see and reade, wickednes to haue bene set vp, lies to haue abounded, to haue oppressed and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scured the veritie, and the Religion of God prophaned

            <p>Consider I pray you, what Cipryane writeth contra Aquarios, who euen in his aige did alledge and lay for them antiquitie. Pas, pas thy way (sayeth he) with thy antiquitie, for in so farre as it is preiudiciall to the institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Sauiour Iesus Christe, and to the right vse that he gaue vnto vs, it muste be condamned and the more Ancient that a custome be, it is the more pestilent and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicius, because that thereby men be wrapped vp in a more deipe induration of hartes, and all cloike and couer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of excusation is taken frome them: and this same Author speaking to this same purpose. Our maister Christ (sayeth he) sayeth not, <hi>Ergo sum consuetudo:</hi> but he sayeth, <hi>Ergo sum veritas</hi> that is,<note place="margin">This is to be este<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>med lait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inuen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted that is diuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> how old soeu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it be.</note> Christ sayeth not I am consuetude but I am veritie. I might adduce out of Augustine, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome, and others of the Ancientes places to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, but iudgeing it to be plaine and sufficiently prouen, I supersead further probation. Since the Ancients refel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth abuses, what cloik of antiquitie soeuer be pretended, let neuer our selues be so caried away after wickednes, that euer we giue place to it for any pretence: but let vs in deid consider if it hath the fundation of the treuth of God, and not laitly diuised, inuented, and set furth by man, for that is to be iudged laitly inuented, whatsoeuer man hath diuised in the worshipping of God, lyke as your masse is, whatsoeuer antiquitie ye bragge of.</p>
            <p>Your Second note is vniuersalytie, to the which what weight of ꝓbation oght to be giuen, it is easy lykewise to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider, we know the Alcorane to be of greater antiquitie, and receaued vniuersally in mo Regions and countries, nor euer your masse hath bene.<note place="margin">The Turkes religion is more older a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d more vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie reca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued nor the masse</note> Shall we then by this note, authories and allowe it to be good.

We know the craft of the Deuill, euer to haue bene since the beginning, to sturre vp Realmes, nations, and countries, against the treuth, yea, and euen in the places that be espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially called by God,<note place="margin">The craft of the deuil euer to deface the tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uth.</note> sainctified and consecrated to the praise and glorie of his holy Name, that there he maketh his greatest effort, to supplant, distroy, peruert, and deface the whole. How his interpryses prospered amongest the Children of Israell, the peculiare, chosen, and adopted people of God, it is plaine by the Historie, and what vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie he hath had amongest the Christianes, the experience yet still teacheth vs. How he troubleth, stormeth, and rageth now, when as by the mercifull visitation of our God, his shiftes and craft are oppened vp, his members and ministers knowen, and the horne of his kingdome ouerthrowen, yea, and the masse the principal instrument of his forge vtterly broken (which ye in the conclusion of this treaty say, Luther wes forbidden by the Deuil, to the great contempt and ignominie of that godly man, euen as it were, a great absurditie, that the Deuill shall speak any thing that is trew: otherwayes we be instructed by the Spirite of God, to wit, the treuth plainely confessed by the Deuill, the Sonne of God acknowledged in Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listes, and in the Actes of the Apostles, read the .19.
