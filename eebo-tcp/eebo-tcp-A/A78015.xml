            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A LETTER to incite free-born Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to ſtand and contend with a godly jealouſie for their Birth-rights, their Liberties.</head>
            <byline>Written by a lover of Right and Liberty.</byline>
            <p>FEllow-Commoners, who are the Commonwealth, or Native Country-men, or brothers Engliſh-men; for indeed, if we had grace and heavenly wiſdom, we ſhould ſo live, and ſo love, as bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, as <hi>kinſmen in the fleſh</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of the Iſraelites, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.3,4. yea, as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>How comely would it be for brethren to live together in unity in amity,</hi> Pſal. 133. which would be as a precious ointment: Then would not thoſe in place and power ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannize over, and oppreſs, or defraud, or falſly impriſon thoſe that are under them, or extort from them any manner of thing, or ſuffer their Clerks therein, or other Officers: then would be no impoveriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by procured or provoked Law-ſuits, or delayings, demurrings, or falſe returns: then would be no quarrelings, no bloodſheddings, no Wars or Rebellings, or tumultuous proceedings, or cunning con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivements, by machinations or combinations, or excommunicatings; but thoſe of ſuperiority would reſpect ſuch of inferiour rank, and thoſe of inferiour degree would have occaſion to ſpeak well of and honour ſuch as are or ſhould be in place of Judicature, or truſt of ſuperiority or power.</p>
            <p>It is not my intention, herein, perſonally to recriminate any man, though I believe, by my ſufferings and innocencie, through experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence I could nominate many in many places; but to invite to peace, to love; for fightings and quarrelings will never ſettle this Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and therein our common rights and priviledges; but peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionings, intreatings, conferrings, in its time, place, and order, ſo it be not with vain janglings or obſtinacie, but in love and faithfulneſs to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:166404:8"/>
one another. Wherefore do but look back upon the love care, and faithfulneſs of our Anceſtors, who ſet forth <hi>Magna Charta</hi> and other good Laws and Charters for our ſettlement and quiet Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and for our utility or profits and benefits for ever; and to allay the proud coruptions of ſuch who ſhould uſurpe in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning left power to the Communalty in their ſeveral places of abode and capacities in <hi>England,</hi> and to every Free-born Engliſh man therein, whether in Counties, Cities, Corporations, Pariſhes, or Companies to chuſe Governours, or Parliament-men, or all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Officers therein; and again, if that any of theſe intruſted by the Commoners of <hi>England</hi> ſhould abuſe their truſt, then alſo they granted the Communalty power, when any ſhould prove unfaithful to their truſt, and unjuſt in their ſeveral places, to aſſemble toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to diſplace and expunge ſuch, and to chuſe others in their places, who ſhould be faithful Stewards for the peoples benefits, utili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and profits, ever accompting the ſafety of the people to be the ſupream Law, they aluding to holy Writ, that they ſhould chuſe out of the people, for Rulers or Governours, men of courage, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God and hating covetouſneſs. And in holy Writ it is ſaid alſo, that of the Children of <hi>Iſſachar,</hi> which were men that had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the times, to know what <hi>Iſrael</hi> ought to do, there there were two hundred of them, and theſe were called the heads of them, and it is ſaid, that all their brethren were at their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. O my dear brethren of <hi>England,</hi> your times of choyce of Officers is coming, by your Charters, which are promiſed by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to be renewed, and your liberty and freedome confirmed to you: be not therefore more fearful and ſtupid then <hi>

it as a doctrine of love and charity, to rebuke our brother if he treſpaſs againſt us, or any one of us, and repent not of it; or as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, though he be an Elder, a Governour, or Magiſtrate, if he ſin openly, let him be rebuked openly, that the reſt may fear. It is a brand of infamie upon the Prieſts in <hi>Iſrael, Hoſ.</hi>4.6,7,8. that they did eat up the ſins of the people in thoſe dayes, for which they were caſt off from being Prieſts unto God, and their glory turned into ſhame; becauſe they liſted up the peoples mindes thereby in their iniquity, by going out of the way themſelves, they cauſed many to fall, and they themſelves became partial, and therefore were they made vile, and deſpiſed among the people, <hi>Mal.</hi>2.5,6,7,8 9. and the Rulers or Governours were ſo hardened thereby, that they loved to ſay with ſhame Bring <hi>ye, Hoſ.</hi>4.18. that is, to take bribes or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, <hi>Mie.</hi>7.2,3. and who can either truſt a friend or a Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, as our Fathers were for bidden, <hi>Mich.</hi>7.5,6. ſeeing a mans enemies are thoſe of his own houſe? do not we at this time, pull ſin and ſhame, and ſuffering upon our owne ſelves, for that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke not ſuch men among us, do not we thereby eat up their ſins, and by our cowardize and partiality become guilty thereof, and they themſelves deſpiſe us? and we may be ſaid to depart from the Lord our God, and for this to be captivated, and to be reproached and ſubject to payments, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were, and as <hi>Baruch</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, chap.3.7,8. and hereafter our children may ſay, it was for the iniquity of our Fathers, as there it is ſaid, that they are become ſo curſed, and ſubjected, and reproached. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, Better is wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome then weapons of war, and that he knew a poor wiſe-man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver a City, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi>9.15,18.

therein, as experimentally I have often ſeen, and ever ſhall be ſo long as they be cheriſhed or countenanced, I could make this appear in ſeveral caſes, but I promiſed I would not perſonally recriminate; yet I muſt needs commend that ſpoken, as is reported by Colonel <hi>Pride</hi> in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Hall, that it would never be well with <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> until that mercenary Lawyers Gownes were hung up by the <hi>Scotch</hi>-Trophics: for indeed ſuch Counſellors are but concealers of that Law, which is our rights and priviledges, and act more poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickly or ſerpentinely, then really and truly, more for their owne profits utility and ſelf ends, then the Clyents utility or profit, which the Law holds out to all, without reſpect of perſons; but theſe and the Solicitors are they who Jeſuite-like make diſtinguiſhings and diſtinctions, for their owne and their friends ſakes, and ends, for fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy lucres fake; as the unjuſt Steward, in the making his Lord and Maſters accompts, yet he is ſaid to be wiſe, <hi>Luk.</hi>16.8. and ſo are theſe Lawyers and Solicitors comended by many, yea by moſt; but the time may come they may repent of their mercenary and unjuſt monies they have taken to betray the peoples rights; as <hi>Judas</hi> that betrayed the Lord of life and glory, whoſe ſervice is perfect freedom, to which I commend you all, that ſhall read herein, humbly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring Gods glory to be advanced, your ſouls eternally ſaved, and freeborn Engliſh-men kept from oppreſſions, frauds, extortions, taunts, provocations, and falſe impriſonments, that ſo having their undoubted rights, the priviledge of their fleſhly bodies here, they may be enabled thereby to ſerve God in their Spirits, and to do no evil, that ſo they may be ſet at liberty as the ſons of God.</p>

            <p>UNdoubtedly know this, that by receiving thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted right of Voice and Choice of Officers, which is thy Birth-right, if in a capacity to pay Tax and Tallage, in time you may ſee a Reformation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: for, by diſcoveries of mens truſtie actions and their unfaithfulneſſ, they may be either confirmed, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punged out of place; and in time, it may be a means to promote truth and righteouſneſs, by breaking of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations and factions in Guild-halls, Corporations, Fraternities, Common Councels, Aſſiſtants, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees, who are cemented uſually by Oaths of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecie, or ſtrong promiſes of Confederacie; which in ſuch places, or in Committees, cannot be diſcovered, but by their Aſſiſtants, Clerks, or Sollicitors, who have been known (for their own advantages and lucre) to convoy Letters of intelligence, or carry or ſend Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of diſcovery to ſuch party or parties the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee or others ſhall affect: or otherwiſe, I have alſo known Committee-men (though Parliament-men) write Letters againſt the innocent perſon who hath pleaded before them by vertue of Parliament-Acts and Ordinances broken; and they have cleared the guilty and offenders, and acted thereby againſt their own Acts and Ordinances of Parliament, then and ſtill in force: by which example, others have been encouraged ſo to do, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the great damage of the partie or parties, and the enſnaring of the Commonwealth and people, they practiſing like ſons of <hi>Iezebel,</hi> or ſons of <hi>Belial,</hi> 1, <hi>Kings</hi> 8. 10,13.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:166404:10"/>Lord, thus are thine Heritage killed, ſpoiled, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, as of old; and they eat up thy people all the day long, and labour to root out their inheritance, by buying their Debenters at ſmall rates (which is as the price of their blood) and the Lordly buyers thereof receive the full rate of 20s. in the pound for them, when its likely they gave not above 3s. 6d. in the pound for them; and ſome of theſe oppreſſors Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-men. Yet <hi>David,</hi> a King, and a Souldier in the field, and in diſtreſs for water, which three of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders (breaking thorow the enemies hoſt) fetched, he would not drink thereof, but offered it to the Lord, and ſaid, <hi>O Lord, be it far from me to do this thing: Is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives?</hi> 2 Sam.23.15,16,17.

            <p>At <hi>Dover</hi> I once ſaw a Mayor, who the firſt time he did ſit on the Bench in their Guild-hall, after that he was ſworn Mayor, he ſilenced and would have turned off the Bench one of his Brethren, a Jurat there (which is as an Alderman in other places) upon the Bench, becauſe he would not agree with him, the preſent Mayor in being, in a piece of injuſtice; and the reaſon the Mayor ſhewed, was, that the ſaid Alderman or Jurat had not been new ſworn to ſecrecie or privacie ſince he had been ſworn Mayor; I could name the parties, but I forbear: I could alſo nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſeveral injuries done in Guild-hall <hi>London,</hi> and in the Committee of the Militia and Court of Aldermen, and of ſome by Common Councellors and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies with their Aſſiſtants and Clarkes, and that by

combination of, and with their Clarkes, and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and Aſſiſtants, and how by their Oaths of ſecrecie or promiſes, and conſederacie, and private chuſing of Officers, or fore-running their choyce, to the out-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Law, and perverting or Judgement, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the free-born people the Commonwealth, whom they alſo divers times have been fain to arm for their owne preſervations to fight, although they will not allow them voice or choice, even when judgement hath followed them at their heels, for their iniquities, promiſing their deſtructions, and I do believe this truth is known to divers alſo, though the perſons and injuries are not nominated; which for future to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, next unto your reaſonable ſervice performed to <hi>Iehovah,</hi> your vigilancies over thoſe in places, and by a laudable and free choice, diſplacing ſuch as are not truſty and faithful, and labouring, and proteſting alſo againſt falſe Oaths, for becauſe of Oaths our land doth mourn, and much more for ſuch as are Oaths of ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: but wait you with patience in brotherly love, bearing one anothers burthens; that we or ours here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after may happily arrive at the fruition of liberty and reſt from this ſea and calamity of oppreſſion and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; that our children may ſay of us, their deceaſed Fathers hereafter, they acted couragiouſly as free-born Engliſh men in their generation, wiſely as Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths-men in their places and capacities, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly and patiently as Chriſtians, through whom we have had deliverance, and are become a happy Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh people born, and left to freedome and liberty.</p>
