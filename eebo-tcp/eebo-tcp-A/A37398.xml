            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Writ you ſometime ſince my Opinion concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the riſe of Gold and Guinea's in <hi>England,</hi>
the Occaſions of it, the Conſequences attending
it, and the Means whereby it might be reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died;
which if not done, I told you my fears what it
would in time produce, and which you have ſince ſeen
actually come to paſs. And truly, though in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
a ſtranger to my Native Country, yet cannot but
have an Affection for it, and be much concerned at the
difficulty it Labours under in a great meaſure from the
Ill Conduct of its Policy in reſpect to your Coin, and
the little Skill your People have, in reſpect to Gold or
Silver, and the Balance of Trade. Whereon I willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
give you my further Thoughts, as far as my time
will allow me for your own Information: And if you
agree with me, and can make uſe of them for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of the Publick, I ſhall be hearty glad; and though
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48488:3"/>
I have been a ſharer in the Spoil, yet not a little affected
with the Calamity.</p>
            <p>The occaſion of the Advance of Gold and Guinea's, I
obſerved to you, was from the badneſs of your Silver
Coin, that is currant amongſt you, and from whence that
Miſchief had its riſe, that as I hear, a Hundred Pounds in
Silver weighs now generally but <hi>14l.</hi> to <hi>18l.</hi> inſtead of
<hi>32l.</hi> which it ought to weigh; and this you have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
inſenſibly to ſteal upon you, growing every day,
and from one Year to another, Clipping it by degrees
three or four times over, till at laſt it's come to this, that
it can hardly be clipt any longer; and this Evil was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on in City and Country by ill Men, and encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by ſome Goldſmiths, Refiners, and others; as in a
like caſe your Stock-Jobbers did, by deceiving the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
with Tricks and Artifices in your ſeveral imaginary
Stocks ſo called, of Paper, Linnen, Copper, Diving, Dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
Salt-Petre, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which, according to a common No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
amongſt you, every thing is as much worth as it
will ſell for; and ſo thoſe things were bought and ſold
ſome ten times (ſome more, ſome leſs) as much as they
were worth; ſome were perfect Air and Fancy, and many
Families ruined by theſe Projects: And ſo a clipt Shilling
or Half Crown, where is the hurt, it will go? This
brought upon you the riſe of Gold and Guinea's, and
occaſioned our ſending you ſuch great Quantities. But
could your People be guilty of a greater weakneſs, than
to take them from us? <hi>Hamburgh, Spain, Scotland, Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and all other Neighbouring Parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> at an
advanced Price, to cheat your ſelves by an imaginary
Value that you ſet upon them, whereby you brought
your ſelves into Debt to us; for it's the ſame thing I
think, whether you buy Gold of us, or any other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity,
it brings you into Debt to us, and your other
Neighbours, which, ſuppoſing you wiſe Men, you muſt
think to pay us again.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:48488:3"/>
No Man can complain of Gold or Silver being brought
into a Country, if it be the Returns of your Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and that it comes to you at no more than it's worth,
it's a ſign of Riches and Increaſe, and of an over-balance
of Trade in favour of that Kingdom or Country. But
did you enquire how you came by our Gold, that it was
not we, or your other Neighbours owed it you; no,
you bought it at too dear a Rate, making good the Old
Proverb, <hi>A Man may buy Gold too dear:</hi> Not conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how you ſhould pay for it, which muſt be either in
Silver Commodities, or by ſending our Gold back at <hi>4l.</hi>
an Ounce, which you took from us at <hi>5l.</hi> to <hi>5l. 6s.</hi> for
we ſhall not take it at more, and ſo you will loſe back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and forward; and pray conſider if you had not
better been without it. To pay us again Silver
you have none, for you have carried on that Cheat
too far to make 50 or <hi>60l.</hi> paſs for <hi>100l.</hi> We have
had the Clippings off of it; but how did we take them?
Not as you did our Gold, did Silver advance with us, as
Gold has with you; nor did your Commodities imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
advance in any proportion to the riſe of Gold.</p>
            <p>Commodities, I think, we have pretty well drained
you of; and I have heard that ſome of your Unthinking,
Ignorant People have thought it a great Advantage, and
talk big of the riſe of your Wool, Minerals, Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,
Skins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I muſt confeſs it's a good Effect of a
bad Cauſe; but it has no Foundation if you examine it,
nor have your People any reaſon to rejoyce at it, without
it be in making them dear to your ſelves, and cheap to
your Neighbours. Matter of Fact will prove this: You
have no more Money from us for your Perpetuanoes,
Cloaths, Lead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than you uſe to have, but leſs; I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
to your own Accounts, are they not ſold cheaper
here, and in <hi>Spain, Italy, Germany, Flanders, &amp;c.</hi> than they
uſe to be? We can buy more, and Cloath our ſelves
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48488:4"/>
cheaper with your Cloath than you can do. But above
all, and which is worſt of all, we can ſend them to the
<hi>Eaſt-Indies, Turkey, Italy, Spain,</hi> and all the World over,
cheaper than you can; whereby you muſt loſe your
Trade and Navigation, and become a poor People, if you
think no better of it. As for Example, If our <hi>Eaſt-India</hi>
Company want 1000 Cloaths to ſend to <hi>India,</hi> or our
<hi>Turkey</hi> Merchants to <hi>Turkey;</hi> they buy, and you buy, at
ſuppoſe <hi>10l.</hi> a Cloth, ours coſt us but about 75 to 80
Guilders, yours <hi>10l.</hi> for ſo I muſt call it, though I muſt
confeſs it's not above <hi>6l.</hi> of good Money; the Queſtion
is, Which of us can ſell cheapeſt abroad, and upon the
Returns, will be the beſt Gainers, he that has laid out
75 Guilders, or he that has laid out <hi>10l.</hi> And whether
we cannot afford to ſell our Returns cheaper, either from
<hi>India</hi> or <hi>Turkey,</hi> and work up our Silk into Manufactures,
and ſend them out again to any Part of the World,
cheaper by almoſt 25 <hi>per Cent.</hi> than you can? If this be
true, you muſt loſe all your Trade. The ſame Reaſon
holds in your Silver ſent to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> we can ſend
an Ounce, which ſtands us in <hi>5s. 2d.</hi> for Silver is not more
worth here, and you muſt go with Pieces of Eight at <hi>7s.</hi>
or Bars at <hi>6s. 4d.</hi> Which goes cheapeſt to Market? And
which can ſell cheapeſt at their return? The ſame thing is
true in your Eaſt-Country Trade, for your Stores, in your
Trade with us and all the World beſides. Ask any of your
People that have been lately here, if they can buy any
more for a Guinea now you call it <hi>30s.</hi> than you could
when you called it <hi>21s. 6d.</hi> The <hi>Dutch</hi> are wiſer, and
it will, it muſt be ſo with you in a little time.</p>
            <p>Beſides, as to your Manufactures, you ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
and take heed that you be not exhauſted of all
you have, and want Wool to ſet your People at Work,
and Employ your Poor. I think it's evident you have
almoſt cut the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchant, and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Shipping
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48488:4"/>
out of all Trade; for a <hi>Dutchman,</hi> a <hi>Spaniard, Portuguez,</hi>
or <hi>Italian,</hi> makes his Advantage at firſt: Lays out leſs
Money, runs the Riſque of leſs; as thus, if they remit
their Money, ſuppoſe the <hi>Italian</hi> 1000 Dollars from <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorn,</hi>
he has <hi>300l.</hi> at <hi>6s. per</hi> Dollar; his Exchange is
made, and he has <hi>300l.</hi> for what he would have had
formerly but <hi>230l.</hi> he runs the Riſque of no more than
he did before. You have your Exchange to make, more
Money to lay out, a greater Sum to run the Riſque of, or
to Enſure upon. So the <hi>Spaniard</hi> gets <hi>5s. 8d.</hi> for his
Piece of Eight, the <hi>Portuguez 7s. 6d.</hi> for his Milrea, and
we give you but <hi>27s.</hi> for your Pound, and have all of us
theſe Advantages upon you, and you muſt wait the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty
of the Exchange for your Returns, and of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets,
either at home or abroad, for your Sales; but to
place it where there is no Exchange, we have all cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
20 to 25 <hi>per Cent.</hi> Advantage upon you.</p>
            <p>All which conſidered, if you will continue your Trade,
Employ your People and Shipping, and ſubſiſt under an
Expenſive (though Neceſſary) War, you muſt call in
your Money, new Coin it of its Ancient Weight and
Allay; abate, as much as in you lyes, the Conſumption
of Foreign Commodities, eſpecially thoſe of Luxury and
Prodigality; be thrifty in all your Expences, and above
all, greater care muſt be taken of your Trade, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
thoſe Loſſes which you have ſuſtained, and is in a
great meaſure the cauſe of all your Miſeries.</p>
            <p>I am informed that the main Objections againſt the
Calling in, and new Coining your Money, are reduced
to theſe four.</p>
            <list>
               <item>(1.) How you ſhall make good the Loſs to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
That they will loſe <hi>8s. 6d.</hi> by a Guiney,
and perhaps 30 to 40 <hi>l.</hi> or 50 <hi>l.</hi> in a Hundred.</item>
               <item>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:48488:5"/>
(2.) That during the War it's not convenient to be
done, it muſt be in a time of Peace.</item>
               <item>(3.) That if it be brought to its due Weight and
Fineneſs, it will be all carried out, and you will
want the Species of Money.</item>
               <item>(4.) That it paſſes, and ſerves all neceſſary Occaſions
of Life, buys Bread, Drink, Meat, pays Houſe-Rent,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>For the Firſt, it would not become me to Adviſe the
making or not making good the Loſs to the People, nor
the Method of doing it, that will be duly conſidered
by your Parliament, who now ſuddenly are to meet;
and God Almighty proſper their Conſultations.</p>
            <p>For the Second, its not being to be done during the
War: I think the War is an Argument for doing it. I
do not ſee how you can carry on the War unleſs it be
done; I could be glad to have the Reaſons ſent me that
thoſe Men give, who make this difficulty, the delay of
it, to any conſidering Man, muſt make the Sore worſe,
and the Contagion ſpread: I would hope that it's not
ſo bad as we fancy, and that great Quantities of large
Money are hoarded up by thoſe that can keep it, which
is laid by now upon the fear of an Alteration; and if
nothing be done in it, Neceſſity may force that abroad,
and ſo come to be clipt, and thereby make the Loſs
greater. You have ſeen, and are convinced, that had
it been done in 1694. your Money was not then ſo bad
as it is now, and it's dangerous to let a thing run too
long without Repair. Perhaps, and ſo much the better,
that it's only the very worſt of your Money that paſſes
now one to another: But I hear that it's with difficulty
that that is paid, and that one third of it is Iron, or
counterfeited. Can you think that by that time the War
is at an end, which God knows when it will, but that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48488:5"/>
much more of your Silver Money will be Clipt, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
your quantity of Iron and Counterfeit Money
doubled upon you, ſo that what would make good the
Loſs now, may be double or treble then. Beſides, if it
be not done now, your Guineys muſt riſe, if you will
keep them; ſo that the Loſs may come to be 18 <hi>s. 6 d.</hi>
on a Guiney, inſtead of 8 <hi>s. 6 d.</hi> A Man need be no
Prophet to tell this, they are better worth 40 <hi>s.</hi> than
100 <hi>l.</hi> in common Tale 50. then you will Repent, as
ſurely you now do, that it was not done laſt Year, or
ſeven Years ago: And conſider how much better it had
been for you, that your Bank, Companies, Goldſmiths,
Refiners, and Jews, had Exported your Coin inſtead of
thoſe Millions of Ounces of Clipt Silver, for that was
robbed from the Publick, which now cry to have it made
good to them; and if ſtill delayed, your Growth and
Manufactures muſt daily riſe, to the Prejudice of the
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> and Benefit of Foreigners: And your Exchanges
by conſequence muſt render not only your own Goods
and Product, but all Foreign that you Import, exceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dear to you.</p>
            <p>To the Third, That if it be brought to its due weight
and Fineneſs, it will be all carried out. It's a certain
Truth, ſo it will, ſo it muſt; if you owe, you muſt pay,
there is no Remedy: But you would not part with your
Money. The Trade of a Nation is the ſame as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
ſingle Perſons, and holds equally true. Two
Merchants agree for Commodities, or two Farmers
agree, one ſows Wheat, the other Barley; and they are
to Truck, ſo many Buſhels of Barley againſt ſo many
of Wheat; the Barley is cut and delivered, the Crop of
Wheat fails; now, muſt not the want be made good in
Money, if he has it, or be truſted, or the Man muſt
break? This is the Nature of Trade in and with all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and of <hi>England</hi> at this time, who is in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48488:6"/>
of the Man with his Crop of Wheat. You abate
nothing of your Expence, you have an Army and Fleet
abroad to maintain; your Loſſes by Sea, eſpecially from
the Eaſt and Weſt <hi>Indies,</hi> the moſt Profitable of your
Trades, have been Great. Your Crop has failed, but
ſtill you would keep your Money, but you cannot;
you owe, and you muſt pay. We take your Woollen,
Goods, and Minerals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and we muſt have the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
Balance in Money, and if you have no Silver,
our Gold muſt come back, though you ſhould carry on
the Cheat further upon your ſelves, and raiſe your
Guinea to 35, nay, 40 <hi>s.</hi> You muſt by care of Trade
get us into your Debt, and then you will have our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.
You have an Inſtance with <hi>Ireland</hi> very plain,
100 <hi>l.</hi> in <hi>England</hi> uſed to be worth 110 <hi>l.</hi> to 115 <hi>l.</hi> in
<hi>Ireland;</hi> now they write me thence, that they give but
80 to 83 in <hi>Ireland</hi> for 100 <hi>l.</hi> in <hi>England.</hi> They ſent
you all their Guineys, and though they raiſed them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
themſelves from 23 <hi>s.</hi> to 26 <hi>s.</hi> which they needed
not have done, they muſt and will have their Gold a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and they are now going back. You may ſend
them Guineys at 30 <hi>s.</hi> which they taking at 26 <hi>s.</hi> is
better than to loſe 24 <hi>per Cent.</hi> by the Exchange.</p>
            <p>The other Objection, of your Clipt Money ſerving
and buying all the Neceſſary Occaſions of Life, as
Bread, Beer, Meat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> has little in it, (for that is not
altogether true, your Corn is the dearer) unleſs the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
was all that you had need of; you ſee that all
things elſe, both Exported and Imported, are regulated
in ſome meaſure by the Value of your Money, and it
has its Influence, and will daily have more and more
upon your Proviſions.</p>
            <p>It's reported here, that you are upon a Project of
leſſening the Weight of your Money, by making it 20
<hi>per Cent.</hi> or any thing, what you will, leſs in Weight,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48488:6"/>
than you formerly coined it, and to ſtamp 4 <hi>s.</hi> and call
it, and make it paſs for 5 <hi>s.</hi> Surely this Fallacy can
never paſs upon <hi>Engliſh-men,</hi> that have ſeen and known
the folly of ſuch Devices in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal:</hi> And
ſome ſay, it will bring you in Silver; it may do ſo,
and abundance more, if you will call 2 <hi>s. 6 d. 5 s.</hi> and
make it paſs ſo; and you ſhall have Silver as you have
had Gold, but remember who will get by it. You
muſt pay us for it, not in Name, we ſhall not take
2 <hi>s. 6 d.</hi> for <hi>5s.</hi> but it will pleaſe us to ſee you bubled,
and that you will ſell us any thing upon that foot. We
ſhall buy all you have with your imaginary <hi>5s.</hi> and
furniſh the reſt of the World with them; for if your
Goods, Growth, Product and Manufactures, and Lands
do not immediately advance in proportion, we ſhall
have a fine time to buy Goods and Land in <hi>England;</hi>
and we ſhall buy your Shipping too, for I cannot ſee
any further occaſion you can have of it. Is your
Landed-man aſleep, and thinks nothing is the matter
that Lands in <hi>England</hi> could not be purchaſed, 10 <hi>l.</hi> a
Year, at 20 Years Purchaſe, under 2100 Guilders, and
that now we can buy 10 <hi>l.</hi> a Year for 1600 Guilders;
that is, ſome few Years ſince 200 <hi>l.</hi> in <hi>England</hi> would
have coſt us 2100 Guilders, and now we have it for
1600. So that your Lands are not riſen, but fallen
Five Years Purchaſe, and you ſeem not aware of it.
And does not the Country Gentleman find that he has
not ſo much for his 100 <hi>l.</hi> as he uſed to have, of Sugar,
Linnen, Wine, Apparel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nor can he ſpend ſo much
as he uſed to do. On which I could ſay much more;
but I doubt I have been too Prolix. You will Pardon
my indigeſted Thoughts in Love and Zeal to my Native
Country, and in Anſwer to your Deſires, Who am,</p>

                  <hi>P. S.</hi> The Conſequences of leſſening the weight of
your Coin, with reſpect to your ſelves, or amongſt one
another, muſt ſtare every Man in the Face; that you
muſt loſe ſo much of your Rents, Debts, value of your
Lands, unleſs your Tenants take new Leaſes, and the
Landlord advance his Rent ſo much, and all Contracts
be made void, and Debts be paid in old Money. But
I have rather confined my Thoughts to what relates to
you and us, and your other Neighbours, that what is
owing to you abroad, muſt be remitted to you, payable
in Old Money, as you have it now from <hi>Spain,</hi> or I
fancy you will come by the Loſs.</p>
