            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To His GRACE
The Duke of ORMOND, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IT is an old Observation that one Misfortune always at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
another. I have sufficiently experimented it; and
I may as justly say the same thing of my folly, in the
Conduct of my Life, and in what relates to this Play. It
was folly in me to Write at all, greater to Write no better,
and chiefly to Print what I have Writ. If in any thing I
have acted with Conduct and Prudence, 'tis in begging Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
for this from your Grace, who are so able to shield
both this and its Author from their Enemies. And indeed,
I may say it is natural in me, to claim this from you; because
your Family have vouchsafed to be the Patrons of mine for
several Generations. Nor shou'd I doubt your proving so to
me, since you are replete with Goodness, and inherit all the
Virtues of your Ancestors, had I the least Pretence to say so
of my self; but I can only boast the same Zeal and Affection
for your Service and Interests.</p>
            <p>I perceive that the Characters of <hi>Alboino</hi> and <hi>Rosamund</hi>
are not agreeable to the present Taste of the Town; the
best defence I can make is, that I have follow'd the truth
of the Story, as any one will find, who will take the Pains
to read it in the Fourth or Fifth Page of <hi>Machiavel</hi>'s Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
of <hi>Florence:</hi> There are, without doubt, other faults in
it, I wish, those who have the Wit to observe them, wou'd
have the Candour to inform me of them, that if ever I am
<pb facs="tcp:65406:4"/>
Idle enough to write again, I might indeavour to avoid them:
And tho' this shou'd abound with more, yet I fancy, there are
many in this Town, who will have good or ill Nature enough
to acknowledge, there are great Allowances to be made to a
Man's first Play, and to a Man of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A considerable time after this was Writ, I was inform'd,
That Sir <hi>William Davenant</hi> had made a Play on the same
Story; I knew it not before, nor have I yet seen it: It was
very unhappy for me to happen on the same Subject with so
Ingenious a Person; I suppose no one will think me design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
guilty of such Confidence; that is a Vice, I hope I shall
never be justly tax'd with; and yet I have now insensibly
slid into it; for it does not argue greater assurance in one
so weak as I am, to write after him, than to write to you.
And therefore tho' I allow the Errors the Criticks may please
to find in this Trifle, and tho' I slight no one's Opinion or
Censures; yet they must excuse me, if I declare, I dread
not those so much, as that your Grace will not Pardon this
Presumption in,</p>

and most Faithful Servant,

            <l>AS a Pale Virgin coyly do's refuse,</l>
            <l>To grant the Favour which she longs to lose;</l>
            <l>Faintly contending, that she may remove</l>
            <l>The actual Consummation of her Love;</l>
            <l>Fain wou'd she have her Dreams unridled to her,</l>
            <l>Yet bashfully resists him, that wou'd shew her:</l>
            <l>Seems to desire no farther Prosecution,</l>
            <l>Yet wishes for the Hour of Execution;</l>
            <l>At length she understands the full Intent,</l>
            <l>Partly by Rape, and partly by Consent.</l>
            <l>So this Day's Author between Hope and Fear,</l>
            <l>Hopes to succeed, yet trembles to appear.</l>
            <l>He struggl'd long against his Muse's force,</l>
            <l>(Jades are more headstrong, than a Well-bred Horse)</l>
            <l>His <hi>Phillis</hi> first, by Songs, he try'd to move,</l>
            <l>Two curst Diseases, Poetry and Love!</l>
            <l>And having once giv'n loose to her dull Rage,</l>
            <l>She now has Impudence to mount the Stage.</l>
            <l>Just so the Nymph, no more by Honor aw'd,</l>
            <l>She turns Pit-Whore, then Gallery, then Bawd.</l>
            <l>Too like are Poets to a common Whore,</l>
            <l>As being much despis'd, and very Poor.</l>
            <l>No better Evidence can I'm sure be found,</l>
            <l>Where there are some kind Masks, where Wits abound.</l>
            <l>How happy were't wou'd both leave off in time!</l>
            <l>Scribling and Loving quit, while in their Prime.</l>
            <l>But being pleas'd at first, they still go on,</l>
            <l>And never leave, till they are both undone.</l>
            <l>Till one is swing'd, and till the other's damn'd.</l>

               <p>Were I a Woman, I should be apt to suspect want of VVit, or want

me in his circumstances, what greater Madness can there be, than for Poverty
to Court Beggary: To have a whining Couple sigh out their Necessities, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead

as Generous, as Rich; and truly, I think, there can be no greater Proof gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

               <p>Secrecy is my greatest Virtue. You have promis'd to trust both

               <p>'Tis the last indeed, for Men seldom give any after. Marriage is no
more a Proof of Love, than a Security of Constancy. Do not I daily vow Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity;
the rest is no more but Ceremony, and whatever consists so wholly
of that, be assur'd has little truth in it. Besides, you'll lose the greatest Tye

               <p>Nay, now you suspect my Honour again: But tho' it should be known,
I'll place you above Censure; fear not that, while I'm your Lover. Poverty
and Disrepute are always join'd, the Rich are never scandaliz'd. And Wives
now a-days run a greater Hazard of being kept Poor, than Mistresses, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
are more contemptible.</p>

All this did <hi>Almachild</hi> give me, only to speak in his behalf. I wonder when your

you a Load of shatter'd Legs and Arms, and broken Skulls; tho' one would

Sword, or in his ghastly Scars? Better he could prove his Honour by the
depth of his Pocket, than by the depth of his Wounds. His Honour is more
likely to send him handsomly out of the World, than maintain you so in it.
And I'll justifie, that tho' there were a Standing Army, this Purse has more

all the Swords in the Army.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Alma.</speaker>

            <head type="sub">Spoke by Miss Dennis Chock.</head>
            <l>OF all the Actors you have seen this day,</l>
            <l>Our Scribbler culls out me, t' excuse his Play,</l>
            <l>I cry'd I was too young; be said, he knew</l>
            <l>The likeliest way to please, was to be new.</l>
            <l>I cou'd not choose but laugh, to find the Fool</l>
            <l>Shou'd think Ine're was try'd, bred in this School:</l>
            <l>And therefore, to remove his gross mistake,</l>
            <l>I told I'd been us'd before to speak.</l>
            <l>But since I was't address to you, he swore,</l>
            <l>It was no fault, to have been us'd, Before.</l>
            <l>Tho he has taken after all wrong measure,</l>
            <l>Either to give the Men, or Ladies Pleasure.</l>
            <l>Gladly he wou'd divert yon beauteous Row;</l>
            <l>In vain he strives, for by my self I know,</l>
            <l>They hate, what they admir'd an hour ago.</l>
            <l>Yet, since they are not always of one mind,</l>
            <l>Some, at some minutes, may perhaps be kind.</l>
            <l>One tender look from them will please him more</l>
            <l>Than when the Pit applauds, or Gall'ries roar.</l>
            <l>And for the Men, I m told there was a time,</l>
            <l>When nothing mov'd like Virgins in their Prime.</l>
            <l>But Time alas is chang'd; now 'tis not so,</l>
            <l>Nothing will please the Beaux now, but a Beau.</l>
            <l>They come not now with Masks to keep a pother,</l>
            <l>But from Side-boxes ogle one another.</l>
            <l>But I forget for what I am come here.</l>
            <l>Well, 'tis not yet too late, because I hear,</l>
            <l>For all your forward boasts, you love the Rear.</l>
            <l>I come, to beg for Mercy for the Play,</l>
            <l>Yet do not think, I'll for your Judgment stay.</l>
            <l>No, I'll be gone, because such gen'rous Youths,</l>
            <l>When my Back's turn'd, will speak the kindest Truths.</l>
