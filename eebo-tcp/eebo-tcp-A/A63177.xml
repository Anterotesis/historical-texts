         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Publick vvithout Licence from the King, or from ſuch
Perſons as he thought fit to entruſt vvith that Affair.
But ſuch is the Age that vve live in, that a man that hath Wit
enough for to libell any Man in the Government, thinks
he hath Licence enough to expoſe that Man to publick
Knowledge alſo. And they do it under ſpecious Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
becauſe they think that any man may be expoſed to
the publick Cenſure, that they can either call a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> or
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51406:6"/>
but <hi>popiſhly</hi> affected, and that man is either the one or the
other, that is not agreeable to every Raſcally Humour that
ſome People affect. I acknowledge, my Lord, that any
man that will in a Legal Manner endeavour to ſuppreſs
<hi>Popery,</hi> ought to be encouraged in his Endeavour, to the
utmoſt, but if in Caſe any man vvill be tranſported
with Zeal, becauſe he is of a Party, and under pretence of
endeavouring to Suppreſs <hi>Popery,</hi> ſhould ſupport a <hi>Party,</hi>
that man ought to be detected. The Author of this Pac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet
of <hi>Advice from Rome,</hi> or the Publiſher of it, Mr. <hi>Carr,</hi>
that is now the Defendant, he thinks he can ſcratch the
Itch of the <hi>Age,</hi> and that he may Libel any man concerned in
the Government, if he can but call him a <hi>Papiſt</hi> or <hi>popiſhly</hi>
affected; let a man be never ſo honeſt, let a man be never
ſo much for the Support of that Religion that every ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
Man ought to Support, that is, the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi>
as it is Eſtabliſhed by Law, without going to <hi>Rome</hi> or
<hi>Amſterdam</hi> for Aſſiſtance. I will not mention the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
that are concerned in it, but I will <hi>apply</hi> my ſelf whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to this matter, that it is the Opinion of all the Judges of
<hi>England,</hi> that it is the Law of the Land, that no Perſon
ſhould offer to expoſe to publick Knowledge any thing
that concerns the Government without the Kings imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Licence. Now we are to try whether this Perſon expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
this thing to publick Knowledge, and that is matter,
Gentlemen, that you are to trie. The other is the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Court, vve are to ſay vvhether, if vve prove the
Fact, this man is guilty of Puniſhment, and no doubt the
Juſtice of the Nation vvill puniſh him. But vvhen I ſee
ſo many ſvvarm about me, I am vvilling to hear vvhat
Proof there is.</p>

                  <p>I am Councel for the <hi>Defendant.</hi> May it
pleaſe your Lordſhip, and you Gentlemen of the Jury. I
am Councel in this Cauſe. And the Queſtion is, Whether
or no we muſt take the Information as it lies? And true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
for the firſt part of it, whether there was a Plot or no,
I do not intend to make exceptions: for I believe there
was one, and do intend to take it as in the Information.
Gentlemen, we are to proceed now to this other Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
which is, my Lord, Whether or no this <hi>Defendant,</hi> that
is <hi>Carr,</hi> did <hi>falſely and malitiouſly,</hi> and with <hi>deſign to ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize
the Government,</hi> cauſe to be printed and publiſhed this
falſe Libel, that is in the Information. Now truely, my
Lord, We that are for the <hi>Defendent,</hi> ſay we are not guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
My Lord, we very well know how penal a thing it
is, for a Man to be the Author of a Libel that relates to
the Scandal of the Government. And, my Lord, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this <hi>Defendent</hi> be guilty of this or no, we muſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51406:11"/>
that to your Lordſhips, and the Juries conſideration. They
have produced two Witneſſes, that is to ſay, the Printer
and his Man. Now, my Lord, there hath been going
out for ſome time, <hi>a Weekly Pacquet of Advice from Rome;</hi>
and I did ask the Witneſſes (for the Information Points
at one Paragraph, and puts the Paragraph <hi>In haec verba</hi>)
I did ask him, whether or no he did ſend, or, whether the
Matter that he ſent, is that contained in this Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
That he could not Swear; but muſt be left in point
of Evidence; it being, we allow, a very penal Matter. The
ſecond Witneſs, and the firſt Witneſs likewiſe ſay, there
was a Boy, but whether that Boy came by his Maſters
direction, he does not know. I ask't him if ever his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
ſent the Boy, he does not know; he ſays that he ſent
him. But the laſt Witneſs ſays, divers were had from the
hands of <hi>Carr;</hi> but whether it was the thing that is now
complained of; there is the Queſtion, and that is in the
dark. For, by your Lordſhips leave, I do not underſtand
that ever this man was complained of to any publick Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
for writing this Book: for it was thought he was
a <hi>Satyriſt</hi> againſt <hi>Popery;</hi> and thought to be very well liked
on, til this Fault was found with it; and 't may be very juſtly,
whether or no we be guilty of this, is uncertain: for we
know, in the Age we live in, there are two many ſhams
put upon men, and who knows, but that the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> that
might have an ill will to this Mr. <hi>Carr,</hi> that hath been no
Friend to them, might ſhuffle in this Paragraph, by that
means to have Juſtice come upon him. I would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive
againſt common Evidence, where a Man is guilty
to the Publick; but we know there are abundance of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices
in this Age to abuſe Men. For this purpoſe I hope
your Lordſhip and the Jury will expect that you ſhould
have poſitive Evidence againſt him. Now, granting your
Lordſhip ſhould have Conjectural Evidence, that he
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51406:12"/>
did cauſe it to be Printed and publiſhed, that this Man
did write it, is, I ſay, very uncertain, for there is no poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Evidence. What a man may have in his private
thoughts of it, is not enough: but whether <hi>Secundum alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gata
&amp; probata,</hi> it ſhall be alleadged and proved that this
man was the Author of it. Now, my Lord, I ſay, I
muſt ſubmit it to your Lordſhip, I ſay, that as to the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
it to be Printed, or the cauſing it to be Publiſhed, or
that this individual Paragraph was writ by him in Order to
its being Printed or publiſhed, my Lord, I ſay, there is but
remote and conjectural Evidence, and an angry <hi>Papiſt</hi>
might contrive this way to have an Innocent <hi>Proteſtant</hi>
found guilty.</p>

                  <p>With your Lordſhips leave, I have one
thing to put to your Lordſhip. The Information ſayes,
<hi>falſe, illicite, &amp; malitioſe.</hi> I know there are ſome things
that do imply Malice in themſelves. Truly, my Lord,
I am upon a tender Point, and know not how to expreſs
my ſelf. I ſay, ſuppoſing it ſhould fall out, that this Man
writ this Book, and he might have ſome little extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies
in his Head in writing, whether this Man did it
malitiouſly to ſcandalize the Government, as the <hi>Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
ſays, is a Queſtion. Truely, my Lord, there is many
an indiſcreet Act a man may be guilty of, that cannot
be called a malitious Act; and that is the ſecond thing,
there muſt be Evidence that this Man did it malitiouſly,
or that he did it with a deſign to ſcandalize the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
If you be of Opinion, that it is otherwiſe, that is, in
your Lordſhips Breaſt, we are of the Negative, and we
ſay, we can't prove a Negative. But if you find him In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,
I ſuppoſe there will be no Cauſe to complain of
him afterwards, for he had no Malice in his Heart.</p>

If he be a very good Subject, if he be upon a Square in
every reſpect, a Perſon that loves his King, and loves the
Government, in Church and in State if he be ſuch a Perſon,
he cannot be thought guilty; my Lord, we will prove
him to be ſuch a Man, and I hope the Gentlemen will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
us.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, it ſeems he was accounted the

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>R.</speaker>
                  <p>If we ſhould not do right, we diſclaim that Service
we owe to the Crown, and that reſpect we owe to the
Government, as honeſt Men, and as true <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and
as much againſt <hi>Papiſts,</hi> as any men whatſoever. I ſhall
endeavour to give the World ſatisfaction, that this man
is guilty of this Offence. My Lord, for any man to come
and pretend that we muſt prove, that a man is malitious,
or becauſe that a Man writes againſt the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> he muſt
never therefore be convicted of Malice, ſurely, is a ſtrange
Argument; And I wonder to hear any Man that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51406:14"/>
to reaſon, Men of Sence, and Conſcience, and Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ſo out of their common Senſe and Underſtanding, as
to make that go as an Argument. Gentlemen, the things
themſelves beſpeak their Malice. For ſo we in our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
diſcourſe, when we bring our common Actions, (of
which you have heard a number) if in Caſe, any man call
a man <hi>Thief,</hi> we ſay he does falſely, and malitiouſly, and
ſcandalouſly call a man <hi>Thief.</hi> If we prove he called him
<hi>Thief,</hi> the very thing does intimate, he does it falſly, ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalouſly,
and malitiouſly. Therefore, the thing it ſelf
is a ſufficient Indication of the <hi>Malice</hi> and <hi>Depravity</hi> of it.
There's no man, but may know in plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> what the
meaning of theſe words; It is as plain as can be in the
World. We muſt debauch our <hi>Underſtandings,</hi> and be as
great <hi>Doltheads,</hi> as they would make all men that will be
of their Party, if we don't plainly ſee into the meaning of
theſe words, That <hi>Juſtice is to be bribed with Mony.</hi> In the
next Place, Gentlemen, we do not come and ſay, that the
Information lies againſt theſe very particular words, that
is a Miſtake of the Information, but the Information
is, that he did cauſe to be Printed and Publiſhed a Book,
in which among others, there were ſuch words as theſe;
though, if they had been the very words themſelves, the
very words have been proved. Now, <hi>there is no better
Proof under the Heavens, than the Proof we have offered.</hi> The
Printer himſelf, he comes here and ſaies, that <hi>Carr</hi> did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
himſelf the Author, and he did gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
publiſh the Book. I appeal, if you do not
Believe it. This they would now come and excuſe;
for they are glad to make a Raſcal of any of their Party,
if they can but ſave a man that is Guilty. But, things come
out with much difficulty, and much ſtraitneſs; and I muſt
ſay, if ever any thing were an Inſtance of <hi>Popery,</hi> then that
man is one of the Jeſuited'ſt Fellows that ever was; for he
does, <hi>cant ſo like them,</hi> that a man can't tell how to govern
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:51406:14"/>
Who was it that ſhould write theſe things? Truly,
he had diſcourſt with him about the matter.
Who ſent the Boy? Do you know? Truly I can't
tell, and wonderfull great <hi>Snuffling</hi> and Canting
before he comes to the buſineſs. Beſides, what can
there be more plain than the Proof Pieces before
the Publiſhing. To'ther Man ſayes, that he was
the Man that fetched pieces from <hi>Carr's</hi> own hand,
and that he alwayes looked upon it that <hi>all did</hi> come
from <hi>Carr.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now every man that knowes any thing of Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
knows this, that after it hath firſt taken the Preſs,
it is <hi>alwayes carried back again to the Author,</hi> to ſee whether
it be done according to his mind; and after that,
it comes to the Publick view. And that this man,
<hi>Carr,</hi> is the Author. Mr. <hi>Sutton</hi> and the reſt of his
Witneſſes, if they ſpeak according to Conſcience,
they themſelves looked upon this very Man
to be the Author. Their own Witneſs looked
upon it ſo. It was not only the Private Opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion
of theſe Men, but the General report of all. So
that, my Lord, <hi>had it not been neceſſary to the ſupport of
the Government,</hi> I ſhould have ſcarce troubled my ſelf
to give your Lordſhip and the Jury this Trouble.
But I muſt ſay, and I do believe, that there is no man
whatſoever, that ſtands to have vices of this nature
convicted and puniſhed; but deſires the <hi>Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>
may be ſupported to the utmoſt, and that <hi>Popery</hi>
may be ſuppreſt. But I ſay, who ever it is, that after
this evidence, who is bound by his Oath to go ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to evidence, ſhall acquit this man, he muſt
be a man of a <hi>Humming Conſcience</hi> indeed.</p>

in this caſe. That it is an unlikely thing that a <hi>Papiſt</hi>
ſhould ſet out this Pacquet at this time. For then
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51406:15"/>
my Lord, how came it to Paſs, that Mr. <hi>Carr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> had
none came out that Week; for his is <hi>a weekly intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</hi>
If Mr. <hi>Carr's</hi> had come out and this likewiſe
there had been ſome pretence for this: but ſince
there came out but one, that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſet out this
is unlikely. They have not pretended to bring
in any body elſe as the Author: but there own
Witneſſes ſay, and they themſelves ſay, he was
looked upon as the Author. Thoſe things that are
done <hi>againſt the Government,</hi> are never done in the
face of the Government.</p>

                  <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
                  <p>Really, Gentlemen, I thought not that
this had been a Cauſe of that Moment, that now I
find it. For their very <hi>Diſturbance</hi> hath <hi>altered</hi> it
from Mr. <hi>Carr's,</hi> to a publick concern. The noiſe
which they make, this way that theſe People uſe,
that with their ſhouts and noiſe attend the cauſe,
hath <hi>quite ſpoiled it.</hi> As in the Caſe of <hi>Harris.</hi> But
thoſe People that did then attend him, leave fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
him in a Goal, <hi>for Five Hundred Pounds,</hi> which
may be five ſhillings a piece had diſcharged him of,
if they had been as free of their purſes as they are of
their noiſes and acclamations: So that in Truth,
they are only violent againſt the Government
whileſt they can make ſhouts and noiſes, but if it
come once to deliver a man from a penal ſum
they will let him rott in Goal. For ſo <hi>Harris</hi> ſent to
me, that <hi>his Party</hi> had all forſaken him, and no man
would give him any thing. And this is for thoſe
<hi>Hummers,</hi> thoſe brave fellows that ſeem to eſpouſe
a Cauſe, and yet leave their Party in diſtreſs: but
let them go away with this, that they prove them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51406:15"/>
hereby<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Enemies to the <hi>Government,</hi> and falſe to that
<hi>Intereſt,</hi> and <hi>Men</hi> that they ſeem to eſpouſe; that come only
here to affront a <hi>Court of Juſtice</hi> with their Shouts and
Noiſes, and will not relieve their Party: for this is the
Complaint of <hi>Harris,</hi> and the Diſparagement of all men
that come to eſpouſe it. This Cauſe, the truth on't is, I
did not look upon to be of this nature and moment, when
it was opened. For though, there are in this very Paper,
upon which the Information is grounded, words malitious
and reflective enough; yet, they were not ſo apparently
appropriated, that a man might obſerve an extraordinary
Deſign in them. This I thought, but really, the caſe is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
even by thoſe Men. For, I'le tell you, <hi>Harris is
poor, and his keeping in Priſon, is principaly occaſioned, from
the manner of the reception of his Puniſhment,</hi> which he calls,
<hi>His Pardon.</hi> And therefore, theſe Fellows, theſe Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
let them all know, when ever they come to eſpouſe
a Cauſe of publick Concern againſt the <hi>Government,</hi> they
ſpoil it; and when they are taken, then they ruine one
another. And this is like to be ſo; for none will help
them with a <hi>Groat.</hi> And this is the misfortune of that
unfortunate Man <hi>Harris,</hi> that he hath no place of Mercy
left him from the King, becauſe, he was attended with
ſuch a rabble, as theſe People are, that have made a noiſe
here, and ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> will give him no help nor aſſiſtance when
he wants it. And, let them know, it hath turned this mans
Cauſe, into a publick Cauſe, becauſe, here are People that
do eſpouſe it, and the Government is hereby concerned
much more, than by any one Action that this <hi>Carr</hi> could
have done. I have ſaid ſo much the more of this, that I
might ſhew you to what a ſad Cauſe this is brought,
from what at firſt it was. For, if it had paſt without
ſuch a noiſe, as you ſee how they expreſs themſelves, I
ſhould not have thought much matter in it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and though,
you had convicted him, I ſhould have thought a better
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51406:16"/>
                     <hi>Sentence</hi> might have ſerved the turn: but, <hi>they have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
Carr, if you find him guilty,</hi> and ſo, it's like to prove,
when ever there is a popular attendence upon publick
Cauſes that concern the Government.</p>
                  <p>The preſent caſe, it ſtands thus. Mr. <hi>Carr,</hi> here is an
Information brought againſt him, for publiſhing a print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Pamphlet, called, <hi>The Pacquet of Advice from Rome,</hi> and
in it there are recited ſome Particulars, which were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
to you before, which was not well done; but yet,
not ſo inſolently done, as ſome perhaps do conceit. The
Queſtion is, whether he was the Author, or Publiſher of
this. You hear, he is thought the Author, but ſay his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel,
it is not plain, and that is true. But, it ſeems by their
own Witneſſes, to any mans Underſtanding, that they
look't upon him as the Author. But then, is he the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
and Publiſher of this particular Book? I had rather,
Mr. <hi>Carr,</hi> with all his Faults about him, and his Hummers,
ſhould go away with applauſe, and have him found not
guilty, than do him wrong in one Circumſtance: for, I
come to try Cauſes according to the truth of Fact, I come
not to plead on one ſide nor another. Not to Condemn
Men that are Innocent; nor, to acquit them, if they be
guilty. Now, it remaines for you to conſider, <hi>what Proofs
you have, as to this particular Book,</hi> againſt which, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
lies. And that's the Printer himſelf, who is one
of the beſt ſorts of Evidence that can be had: for, you
very well know, that Evidences of Fact, are to be expected
according to the nature of the thing. That is, <hi>Forgery,</hi> is
not to be proved ſo plainly, as to expect Witneſſes, as you
do at the ſealing of a Bond: for, Men do not call Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
when they forge a thing. Therefore, in things of
that nature, we are fain to retreat to ſuch probable and
conjectural Evidence as the matter will bear. I believe,
ſome of you have been of Juries at the <hi>Old-Bayly,</hi> and that
even for Mens Lives, you have very often, not a direct
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51406:16"/>
Proof of the Fact, of the Act, or of the actual Killing; but
yet, you have ſuch Evidence by Preſumption, as ſeems
reaſonable to Conſcience. If, there be a known Caſe in
Mens Lives, certainly, that ſhould govern in Offences,
and eſpecially, when Offences are of a nature that reflects
upon the Government. As for thoſe Words, <hi>Illicite, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litioſe,</hi>
unlawfull; for that I muſt recite what Mr. <hi>Recorder</hi>
told you of at firſt, what all the Judges of <hi>England</hi> have
declared under their hands. The words, I remember,
are theſe, when by the Kings Command, we were to give
in our Opinion, what was to be done in point of the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the Preſs. We did all ſubſcribe, that to Print, or
Publiſh any <hi>News-Books</hi> or <hi>Pamphlets of News</hi> whatſoever,
is illegal; that, it is a manifeſt intent to the Breach of the
Peace, and they may be proceeded againſt by Law for an
illegal thing. Suppoſe now, that this thing is not ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous,
what then. If there had been no reflection in
this Book at all, yet, it is <hi>illicite,</hi> and the Author ought to
be convicted for it. And that is for a publick notice to all
People, and eſpecially, <hi>Printers,</hi> and <hi>Bookſellers,</hi> that they
ought to Print no Book, or Pamphlet of News whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
without Authority. So as he is to be convicted
for it as a thing <hi>illicite</hi> done, not having Authority. And
I will aſſure you, if you find any of thoſe Papers, I ſhall
be more merciful in the Conſideration of their Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
if it be inoffencive. But, if ſo be they will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
to Print News fooliſhly, they ought to be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and ſhall be puniſhed, if they do it without Authority,
though, there is nothing reflecting on the Government,
as an unlawful thing. The reaſon is plain. So <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ond are
Men in theſe Days, that when they will deny their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
a penny for Bread, they will lay it out for a Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet.
And it did ſo ſwarm, and the Temptations were
ſo great, that no man could keep two pence in his Poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51406:17"/>
becauſe of the News. But ſtill, they never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
of laying out their Mony, till they found,
there was nothing againſt the Government. This
is not worth a Farthing, there is nothing of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
in it, we will not give a Farthing for it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this Book, if it be made by him to be publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
it is unlawful, whether it be malitious or not.
Now for the Matter, the ſubject Matter. What,
doth <hi>Carr</hi> think he hath too much Wit to fool us
that are to try the Malice. It was ſillily writ, if he
did not believe we underſtood it, and that were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
intolerable in us; I hope, I ſpeak plain: that is,
the ſort of Books that he writ, it muſt be with an
intent, People ſhould know what reflections he
made, and ſhall all Mankind know, and ſhall they
that try the Cauſe not know it. If you find
him guilty, and ſay what he is guilty of, we will
Judge whether the thing imports Malice or no.
Sir <hi>Francis Winnington</hi> hath told you, there are ſome
things, that do neceſſarily imply Malice in them.
If this thing doth not imply it, then the Judges
will go according to Sentence, if it doth, ſo that
it concerns not you one farthing, whether mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
or not malitious, that's plain. Now, there
remains only one thing, that is, whether or no he
was the Publiſher of this Book? for that we have
this Evidence. The Printer tells you, he was the
Perſon that they look't upon to be the Author of
this Book, that he ſent this Book to be Printed by
his Boy. The Printer ſayeth, that he often diſcourſt
with him, and he took it for granted. His Boy
brought it. To what purpoſe? to be Printed. The
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:51406:17"/>
Printers Servant ſaies, they looked upon him as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
and I have fetched Sheet by Sheet, ſeveral Sheets
from his own hand. I will do right in the Caſe, be it
what it will, let him eſcape or not. Say his Councel, had
you this particular Paper from him. I urge this as clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as their own Councel have objected it. For that
you muſt conſider, whether he is the Author of the Book.
You muſt take Evidence in this caſe, as you do all the
Year long; that is, in other Caſes, where you know there
is an abſolute certainty, that the thing is ſo: for humane
frailty muſt be allowed; that is, you may be miſtaken.
For, you do not Swear, nor, are you bound to Swear
here, that he was the Publiſher of this Book; but, if you
find him guilty, you only Swear, you believe it ſo. God
help Juries, if ſo be, in matter of Fact, they ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
otherwiſe. They can't Swear it. Now, the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is, whether you have Evidence enough here to Swear
he was the Publiſher: for this is the main thing, to prove
that he is ſo. Now, the Printer tells you that he
knew the man; that he had frequent converſe with
him about it, and that he took it for granted. Now
conſider, when a man talks at this rate, he does not ſay
he was, but that he took it for granted, he does not as
much as ſay he is. They will own he writ ſeveral Sheets
of this Book; then, why not all this Book. Now, we
come to the more principle matter of Fact, according to
reaſon, and the probable Evidence of things. That this
Perſon is taken to be the Author, and that it was his Boy
that brought theſe Papers to be Printed. If you can't
ſay he ſent him, you can give no Verdict while you live,
if you expect that. The Printer ſaies, he hath been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
diſcourſing with him, that his Boy brought them, and
that he knew no other Perſons in the World, that had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
pretenſions to be the Author, and if he were the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
no doubt, but he is the Publiſher. Whether or no
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51406:18"/>
any body elſe had an hand in this, we don't know. If
you are ſatisfyed in your Conſciences, that you believe he
is not the Author, you muſt acquit him. If you are ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed
it is not he, you muſt find him not guilty. So that
as you are honeſt Men and wiſe, as I believe you are; if
you believe he was not the Publiſher of this Pamphlet,
that he did not ſend his Boy to have it Printed, but that he
came of his own head, you muſt find him not guilty.</p>
