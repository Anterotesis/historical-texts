            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A True Account of a late Horrid Conſpiracy
to Betray Holland to the French,
&amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE unwearied Aims of the <hi>French,</hi> for a
great many years, to ſwallow up the States
of <hi>Holland,</hi> are ſufficiently known to all the
World; and by their Intrigues with the late
unhappy <hi>Penſioner de Wit,</hi> they were once
within an Ace of overturning this Commonwealth for good
and all. That the <hi>French</hi> continue in their former Methods
of Bribing with their Money ſuch <hi>Villains</hi> as are deſtitute of
all Love to their Country, and who are willing to Sacrifice
every thing to their accurſed greedineſs of Money, we have
a freſh Example in the <hi>Treaſon and Trial</hi> of theſe two Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creants
<hi>Jacob Martinet</hi> Sheriff or <hi>Scapen</hi> of the Town of
<hi>Sluys,</hi> and <hi>Cornelius Reolands</hi> Maſter of the Ship called the
<hi>Argle</hi> of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> which was as follows.</p>
            <p>On the Third day of <hi>April</hi> laſt, there was intercepted a
<hi>Packet</hi> of Letters ſewed within the Waſtcoat of a Seaman,
going from <hi>Sluys</hi> to <hi>Oſtend</hi> by Land: which being opened
by one of the Magiſtrates of <hi>Oſtend,</hi> before whom the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
was brought, they were found to contain a danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Conſpiracy to Betray to the <hi>French</hi> the ſtrong Town of
<hi>Sluys,</hi> and thereby a chief Key of <hi>Holland.</hi> Upon which
the Seaman being examin'd, <hi>Declared that he came from</hi> Sluys
<hi>the day before, and was deſigned to find ſome way to get thence
to</hi> Dunkirk, <hi>and that he had received the Letters found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:36770:3"/>
him from</hi> Cornelius Reolands <hi>his Maſter at</hi> Sluys, <hi>and
was to deliver them to one Monſieur</hi> Rayon a <hi>Colonel of a
Regiment of</hi> French, <hi>lying in the Town of</hi> Dunkirk. He fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
confeſſed, <hi>That he had been three weeks before with
Letters from his Maſter to the ſame Colonel, and that he had
returned with Letters from the ſaid Colonel, directed to his
Maſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Fellow, after this Confeſſion, was kept cloſe Priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and an Expreſs immediately diſpatch'd to acquaint the
States with it, who thereupon ordered the Magiſtrates of
<hi>Sluys</hi> to ſecure the ſaid <hi>Cornelius Reolands</hi> in cloſe Priſon,
and to Examine him ſecretly about this Treaſon. <hi>Reolands</hi>
being taken, denied all at firſt, but the Letter he had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to Monſieur <hi>Rayon</hi> being produced againſt him, which
had been taken at <hi>Oſtend</hi> about his Servant, he not only
confeſt it was his, but alſo that <hi>Jacob Martinet</hi> the Sheriff
of the Town was concern'd in the Affair more than he,
and that the Letter written in Cyphers, found about his
man, was written by <hi>Martinets</hi> own hand.</p>
            <p>Upon this <hi>Martinet</hi> being ſecured, there was one Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
immediately directed to the Marqueſs of <hi>Caſtanage</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Governour of the <hi>Netherlands</hi> from the Aſſembly of
the <hi>States of Holland,</hi> to deſire his <hi>Excellency</hi> would be
pleaſed to ſend the Seamen taken in <hi>Oſtend</hi> with the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
Letters, immediately under a Guard to the Town
of <hi>Sluyce,</hi> which his Excellency was pleaſed to do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All things being ready for the Trial of theſe two Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
Count</hi> Horne <hi>Governour of</hi> Sluys <hi>was ordered to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
to the Town to be preſent at, and to haſten the
Trial. Upon the firſt day of this Inſtant</hi> May <hi>the Priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi>
Jacob Martinet <hi>and</hi> Cornelius Reolands, <hi>were brought
to their Trial in the</hi> Town-houſe <hi>of</hi> Sluys, <hi>before Judges
appointed for that Effect, of whom Count</hi> Horne <hi>was
one.</hi> Cornelius Reolands <hi>being confronted with his own
Servant, acknowledged,</hi> That he and the other Priſoner
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:36770:3"/>
had kept Correſpondence with one Monſieur <hi>Rayon,</hi> Colonel
of a <hi>French</hi> Regiment in <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> and by his Means and
Mediation with one <hi>Monſieur de Perry,</hi> Secretary of War
under the Duke of <hi>Luxemburgh,</hi> who was to command the
<hi>French</hi> Army in the Frontiers of <hi>Flanders</hi> this Summer.
<hi>And that he and the ſaid other Priſoner</hi> had received ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Letters from the ſaid Monſieur <hi>Rayon</hi> upon the ſame
Subject, and in one of them a Line from the ſaid <hi>Monſieur
de Terry,</hi> directed to him and the other Priſoner, wherein
he aſſured them, if they would promiſe to accompliſh the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
in hand, he ſhould cauſe to be paid them in hand, each
of them Ten thouſand Livers, and upon the performing of it,
they ſhould receive, each of them, Twenty thouſand more,
with an honourable Retreat and Employment in any place of
<hi>France</hi> they pleaſed. <hi>He likewiſe acknowledged,</hi> That they
were to receive the firſt Ten thouſand Livers apiece at the
Return of his Servant they had ſent upon that Errand, when
he was taken beſide <hi>Oſtend;</hi> and that the way of Returning
the Money was by a Bill of <hi>Exchange</hi> from a Banker of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi>
upon a Jew in <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> payable to the ſaid other
Priſoner <hi>Jacob Martinet. Adding,</hi> That his Servant knew
nothing of the Secret, but only was employ'd to carry the
Letters betwixt <hi>Martinet</hi> and him, and the ſaid Monſieur
<hi>Rayon.</hi> And that he knew nothing of the Deſign till <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinet</hi>
drew him into it, and aſſured him, that there was the
like Deſign in moſt of the Towns of <hi>Holland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Being deſired to give account of the Deſign it ſelf. He
gave it thus:</hi> That the ſaid <hi>Martinet</hi> and He were to let
in a great many <hi>French</hi> by threes and fours, under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Deſerters from the <hi>French</hi> Army, and that before hand,
they were to provide ſeveral private Lodgings for them to be
ready upon call. In the mean time he and <hi>Martinet</hi> were to
provide a great many Fire-locks, under the pretence of buying
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:36770:4"/>
them, in order to ſell them again to the new raiſed Regiments in
<hi>Flanders.</hi> That when they had got into Town a competent
number of <hi>French</hi> in the manner above mentioned, they were
to concert with the ſaid Monſieur <hi>Rayon</hi> a particular night,
in which He with other two Regiments ſhould be in readineſs
to march from the neareſt places of the <hi>French</hi> Conqueſts, to
<hi>Sluys,</hi> by ſuch ways as was laid down in a plan agreed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them. That at the night and hour appointed, the
ſaid <hi>Martinet</hi> and He were to have all the <hi>French</hi> in
readineſs with their Arms to fall upon the Gariſon, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ordinarily but two hundred men upon duty at a time;
And having cut them off, they were at the ſame time to open
the Eaſt Gate to the other <hi>French</hi> under the Command of
<hi>Monſieur Ra<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>on,</hi> and being joyned together to take Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of, and keep the Town for the <hi>French</hi> King, whoſe Army
at the ſame time was to fall down with all diligence and
force upon the Frontiers of <hi>Holland. He further acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,</hi>
That he doubted not but the <hi>French</hi> were tampering
with ſome in most of the Towns of <hi>Holland</hi> to the ſame
effect; and that he knew, there were ſeveral great Sums of
Money returned by Bill to <hi>Amſterdam</hi> to this end, and that
there were ſeveral Agents up and down <hi>Amſterdam, Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdam,
Bergen, U<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſom,</hi> the <hi>Buſh, Utreght, Lyden,</hi> and
all other Towns in <hi>Holland,</hi> who were buſie in making In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treigues
to betray the reſpective Towns to the <hi>French</hi> for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Sums of Money, and Promiſes of great Preferment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cornelius Reolands</hi> being found Guilty upon his Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
was removed, and immediately thereafter <hi>Jacob Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinet,</hi>
the other Priſoner, was brought to his Trial.
Who ſtoutly denied he knew any thing of a Deſign to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
the Town of <hi>Sluys</hi> into the hands of the <hi>French,</hi> or
that he had ever entertained Correſpondence with Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Royon,</hi> or <hi>Monſieur de Terry,</hi> to that or any other
Effect. Whereupon <hi>Reolands</hi> Servant, with whom the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:36770:4"/>
written Letters were found, was produced againſt
him as an Evidence; who being ſworn, depos'd, <hi>That he
had received the Letters, which had been taken about him
at</hi> Oſtend, <hi>from his Maſter</hi> Reolands, <hi>and that he the ſaid</hi>
Jacob Martinet, <hi>was preſent when his Maſter gave them him,
and that</hi> Martinet <hi>deſired him to Return as ſoon as poſſible,
giving him half a Piſtol to drink, ſaying, That if he got a
good Anſwer of ſome Money Buſineſs he had written about, he,
the Deponent, ſhould be well paid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Martinet</hi> briskly deny'd that he ever had ſeen this Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
or had been in Company with <hi>Reolands</hi> but once in
his Life, about ſix years ago. The Evidence immediately
in open Court required two men, whom he knew, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
if they did not ſeveral times ſee his Maſter <hi>Reo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi>
and <hi>Martinet</hi> together at the <hi>Maurice Head</hi> Tavern
in <hi>Sluys;</hi> who upon Oath declared they had often ſeen
them both go into, and come out from that Tavern,
they two all alone, and that within leſs than theſe two
Months. Notwithſtanding all which <hi>Martinet</hi> ſtood firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to his Denial.</p>
            <p>At length the <hi>Declaration</hi> and <hi>Confeſſion</hi> of his Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice
<hi>Reolands</hi> was read before him, whereat he ſeem'd
to be much ſtunn'd, having often changed colour
the time of the Reading it. But inſiſting in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial,
and the Law not allowing the Confeſſion of one
Accomplice to be ſufficient proof, he was adjudged to be
put to the Torture. Whereupon all things being ready
for it, his Courage failed him, and he told the People
appointed to put it in Execution, that he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
all he knew of the Affair he was charged with, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Judges.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:36770:5"/>
Being thereupon called into Court, He freely confeſt
<hi>His being upon a Plot with</hi> Reolands <hi>to deliver up the
Town of</hi> Sluys <hi>to the</hi> French, <hi>after the manner contained
in</hi> Reolands <hi>Confeſſion, with this particular Circumſtance,
That in a Letter Written to him by</hi> Monſieur de Terry,
<hi>Secretary of War under the Duke of</hi> Luxemburgh, <hi>he was
promiſed Ten Thouſand Livers more than was to be given to</hi>

                  <p>WE have fully concerted the manner we
are to act here in delivering up the
Town, and it reſts only, that you be as ready to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuate
your part at a preciſe time to be appointed,
which both Mr. <hi>Reolands</hi> and I think to be moſt
proper ſometime in the middle of <hi>May</hi> next, becauſe
the Army of the States will not be in the Field till
the end of that Month at ſooneſt; You ſee what I ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to ſerve ſo great and generous a Prince, and
it's but a ſmall part of what I would do to ſerve him.
Be ſure you by the Bearer adjuſt the exact time and
way of your being in a readineſs to accompliſh your
part of the Deſign, and I think it were time, that
ſome of theſe Souldiers ſhould be ſtealing in, as you
know. After receipt of yours, we will be every day

making one ſtep or other to forward the thing; And
tho I doubt not but by the ſame Bearer you will ſend
the Bill as you promiſed; ſo I aſſure you, I am more
perſwaded of the reaſonableneſs of having a greater
Summ ready in ſome hand, to make uſe of for gaining
others to our Intereſt, as perhaps the Affairs will
require. I need not ſay more, but commit my For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune

            <p>Theſe <hi>Confeſſions</hi> of both <hi>Jacob Martinet</hi> and of <hi>Coruelius
Reonalds</hi> being again read in open Court, they both of
them received Sentence in theſe words.</p>
            <p>Foraſmuch, as you <hi>Jacob Martinet,</hi> and you <hi>Cornelius
Reolands,</hi> are by your own Confeſſion, and other legal Proofs
and Letters, found Guilty of holding a Correſpondence with
<hi>Monſieur Rayon</hi> Collonel of a <hi>French</hi> Regiment in the <hi>French</hi>
Kings Army, and with <hi>Monſieur de Terry</hi> Secretary of War
under the Marſhal Duke of <hi>Luxenburgh,</hi> in order to betray
the Garriſon and Town of <hi>Sluys</hi> to the <hi>French</hi> for a Summ of
Money, agreed to be paid by the ſaid <hi>Monſieur de Terry,</hi> to
you <hi>Jacob Martinet,</hi> and to you <hi>Cornelius Reolands</hi> for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereof. By which Action the whole Province of <hi>Holland,</hi>
and Neighbouring Provinces would have been in eminent
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:36770:6"/>
hazard of being thereupon ruin'd by the <hi>French</hi> Army. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Court does hereby adjudge you the ſaid <hi>Jacob Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,</hi>
to be taken back to Priſon, and thence upon the Sixth of
<hi>May</hi> Instant, to be drawn upon a Cart to the publick Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
place of this Town, and there to be hanged up by the
Neck on a Gibbet, and being near dead, to have your Bowels
ript up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and thereafter being fully dead, to have your Body
divided into four Quarters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>, to be diſpoſed of as the Court
ſhall afterwards think fit, and your Head to be ſevered from
your Body, and affixt upon the very ſame Gate of this Town
which you deſigned to open to the Enemy. Likewiſe the Court
adjudges you the ſaid <hi>Cornelius Reolands</hi> to be taken back
to the Priſon, and upon the ſaid Sixth of this Inſtant <hi>May,</hi>
to be taken to the ſaid Market place of this Town of <hi>Sluys,</hi>
and there to be hanged up by the Neck upon a Gibbet until
you be dead. Aud this we give for a final Sentence againſt
you both, wiſhing God may ſhew Mercy to your Souls.</p>
            <p>According to this Sentence, upon the ſaid Sixth day of
<hi>May</hi> Inſtant, the ſaid <hi>Jacob Martinet</hi> was brought to the
Place of Execution, where he behaved himſelf very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitently,
and refuſed to ſpeak to the People, and had
the Sextence executed upon him as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>After him came <hi>Cornelius Reolands,</hi> who both in Priſon,
and at the Place of Execution, carried himſelf very devoutly
and penitently: And asking leave if he might ſpeak to the
People, he expreſt himſelf in words to this purpoſe, a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
whereof he had given before-hand to the <hi>Sheriff</hi> or
<hi>Scapen</hi> that attended him.</p>

                     <hi>I</hi> Am brought here justly, for deſigning to betray my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try

my ſelf Guilty of the Crime, and I beg God's forgiveneſs
and your forgiveneſs for it, and am willing to dye for it, as
I juſtly deſerve. I muſt ſay, I did for ſome Months reſiſt
the Offers that were made me by the unhappy man that is
gone before me; but at length my Wants prevail'd with me to
accept what I thought would rid me out of them. This I do
not ſay to excuſe my ſelf in the leaſt; God forbid I ſhould.
And as I conſented to betray this Town, ſo I did promiſe to
do another Villany, which indeed I forgot to tell my Judges
at my Trial; and it was, to ſee if I could prevail with any
Captains of Ships, to betray their Ships to the <hi>French,</hi> for
which I was to receive Money from the <hi>French</hi> Secretary of
War to give to thoſe Captains. I hope your Diſpleaſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
me for ſo Villainous Deſigns will end, when I have
ſatisfied Juſtice with my Blood. I earneſtly beg the aſſiſtance
of your Prayers for me in this my Agony; and I commit my
Soul to God, hoping to be ſaved by the Merits of Chriſt my
Redeemer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Having delivered himſelf thus, and heard the Miniſter
that waited on him pray, and having pray'd himſelf, he
was juſt going to be turn'd off, when pulling up the Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief
that was over his Eyes, he ſaid,</hi> Good People,
there is one thing my Conſcience obliges me to tell you with my
laſt Breath, and it's this; I am affraid there are a great
many ſuch Deſigns in hand up and down this Country like this
for which I ſuffer; and I wiſh there may be ſome effectual
means to prevent them; for I aſſure you the <hi>French</hi> Agents
are very buſie every where, and they ſpare no money to obtain
their Ends I have no more to ſay, but again beg ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
the Aſſiſtance of your Prayers: And I commit my Soul
to God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:36770:7"/>
Having thus ſaid, he was turned over the Ladder, and
his Body afterwards, by order of the Magiſtrates, was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to his Friends to be buried.</p>
                  <p>Thus we have one ſad Example more of the ill Effects
of the <hi>French</hi> Money towards our Country and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth;
but we hope God will diſappoint all their Deſigns,
and bring their Accomplices to juſt Puniſhment.</p>
